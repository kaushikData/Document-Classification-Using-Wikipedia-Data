'''Anne Patricia Briggs''' (born 29 September 1944) is an English [[folk music|folk singer]]. Although she travelled widely in the 1960s and early 1970s, appearing at [[folk club]]s and venues in England and [[Ireland]], she never aspired to commercial success or to achieve widespread public acknowledgment of her music. However, she was an influential figure in the English folk music revival, being a source of songs and musical inspiration for others such as [[A. L. Lloyd]], [[Bert Jansch]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[The Watersons]], [[June Tabor]], [[Sandy Denny]], [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] and [[Maddy Prior]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Graeme|date=October 2007|title=Anne of Folk Fables|url=https://recordcollectormag.com/|journal=Record Collector|volume=341|pages=30-32|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Briggs was born in [[Toton]], [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire]], on 29 September 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/anne-briggs?cat=technology |title=Anne Briggs: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother died of tuberculosis when she was young. Her father, Albert, was severely injured in World War II and she was raised in Toton by her Aunt Hilda and Uncle Bill, who also brought up Hilda's youngest sister, Beryl, and their own daughter Betty. In 1959 she hitch-hiked with a friend to [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They stayed overnight with [[Archie Fisher]], who was at that time prominent in the revival of folk music in [[Scotland]], and through him she met [[Bert Jansch]], who had just begun to compose his own songs. Jansch and Briggs had an instant rapport and were an influence on each other for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes for "A Collection"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the [[Trades Union Congress]] passed Resolution 42, a resolution to develop cultural activities outside [[London]]. To implement this resolution, playwright [[Arnold Wesker]] was appointed as the leader, with [[Ewan MacColl]] and [[A. L. Lloyd|A. L. "Bert" Lloyd]] heavily involved, and [[Charles Parker (producer)|Charles Parker]] on production. Calling themselves [[Centre 42]], they organised a tour around the Britain, hoping to involve local talent at each stop.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At [[Nottingham]], MacColl heard Briggs singing "Let No Man Steal Your Thyme" and "[[She Moves Through the Fair]]" and promptly invited her to perform on stage that night. She became a full member of the tour and recorded the same two songs on an album recorded live in Edinburgh later that year. Briggs decided to leave home, just four weeks short of her eighteenth birthday. Centre 42 gave her an administrative job in their offices, liaising with [[theatre]]s and [[Art gallery|galleries]]. She soon acquired the contacts she needed to pursue her own musical career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boweavilrecordings.com/briggs.html |title=:: Bo'Weavil Recordings :: Artists :: Anne Briggs :: |publisher=Boweavilrecordings.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings of folk music career==
Briggs visited the main British [[folk club]]s which were then becoming well known: [[The Troubadour (London)]], [[The Scots Hoose]] and various Irish music venues. At this time, the emphasis at such venues was on instrumental folk music, and singing was regarded as merely a pause between tunes. A young [[Christy Moore]] heard her and was inspired to give more emphasis, in his own music, to singing rather than playing jigs.

Briggs and Jansch lived together in a [[squatting|squat]] in [[Earl's Court]] before moving together to a house in Somali Road, London, where [[John Renbourn]] lived, and [[The Young Tradition]] also lived for a time. Jansch and Briggs had some resemblance to each other and were often mistaken for brother and sister. It was Briggs who taught Jansch the traditional song "[[Down by Blackwaterside|Blackwaterside]]" which he recorded on his ''[[Jack Orion]]'' album in 1966.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== First recordings ==
Briggs began her recording career by contributing two songs to a thematic album, ''The Iron Muse'', released by [[Topic Records]] in 1963. MacColl and Bert Lloyd sang on the tracks, and [[Ray Fisher (singer)|Ray Fisher]] made a brief appearance singing along with Briggs. An [[extended play|EP]] ''[[The Hazards of Love (Anne Briggs EP)|The Hazards of Love]]'' was recorded in 1963. It was an early inspiration for both [[June Tabor]] and [[Maddy Prior]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At about this time, Briggs entered a relationship with a Scotsman known as "Gary the archer," who proved to be violently abusive.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes for "A Collection"&lt;/ref&gt; She was rescued from this relationship by [[Hamish Henderson]], who accidentally bumped into her and invited her to join [[Louis Killen]], [[Dave Swarbrick]] and [[Frankie Armstrong]] for a recording project. This resulted in the album called ''The Bird in The Bush''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slipcue.com/music/international/celtic/artists/briggs.html |title=Anne Briggs Discography: Slipcue.Com Folk Guide |publisher=Slipcue.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Johnny Moynihan==
While touring England, [[The Dubliners]] met Briggs and thought she would be the perfect musical partner for [[Johnny Moynihan]], a folk singer they knew in [[Dublin]]. In 1965 they accompanied her to [[Ireland]] and for the next four years she spent her summers there, travelling by horse-drawn cart and singing in pub sessions. During the winter months she earned money by touring English folk clubs. Her time in Ireland introduced her to the solo [[Sean-nós song|Sean-nós singing]] heard in the songs of Irish folk artists, and this was an influence on her later singing style, when blended with the elements of traditional English music which she had already taken up.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Briggs was notoriously wild at this time. There are many stories from this period about her, such as pushing Moynihan and [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]] out of a hay loft and, on another occasion, jumping into the sea at Malin Head, Donegal to chase seals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In an episode of [[Folk Britannia#Folk Britannia|Folk Britannia]] (a documentary history of UK folk music aired in 2006) [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] recalled that he only ever encountered Briggs twice and on both occasions she was drunk and unconscious.

Her attendance at bookings was so erratic that it was said she turned up only five times between mid-1963 and early 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mustrad.org.uk/reviews/briggs.htm |title=Anne Briggs - A Collection |publisher=Mustrad.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Moynihan and Irvine formed [[Sweeney's Men]] and Briggs joined them on tours and learned to play the [[bouzouki]], at that time a rare instrument in Britain or Ireland. She wrote "Living by the Water", which was to appear on her 1971 album, accompanying herself on the instrument. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Reluctant star==
The folk-rock impresario [[Jo Lustig]] signed up [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]] in 1968 and a couple of years later took on Briggs. Briggs performed along with the folk-rock group [[Clive Palmer (musician)|COB]] (Clive's Original Band) at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clive Palmer - obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11328267/Clive-Palmer-obituary.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, she recorded an album, ''Anne Briggs'', which was released by Topic. It consisted mostly of Briggs singing traditional unaccompanied songs, but Moynihan plays bouzouki on one track.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later that same year, a second album, ''The Time Has Come'', was released on CBS where she performed her own songs, accompanied by acoustic guitar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The album includes Moynihan's song, "Standing on the Shore," previously recorded by [[Sweeney's Men]]. The [[BBC]] broadcast a film of the Watersons in 1966, "Travelling for a Living," in which Briggs made a brief appearance. [[Lal Waterson]] joined Briggs as a vocalist on the album. Sales of ''The Time has Come'' were poor and it was dropped from CBS's catalogue. The album was re-issued in 1996.

Early in 1973 she recorded a third solo album ''Sing a Song for You'' with instrumental support from [[Ragged Robin]], a folk-rock band led by [[Steve Ashley]]. She was pregnant at the time with her second child. She would eventually move to northern Scotland with her family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was to be her final studio recording. By the time it was issued, Briggs was living in the [[Hebrides]]. [[Fledgling Records]] re-issued it in 1996.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/03/folk.shopping1|title=Gone but not forgotten|last=Petridis|first=Alexis |date=3 August 2007|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Bert Lloyd died in 1990, Briggs was persuaded to sing in a memorial concert. Despite coaxing from some of the brightest names in British folk music, she refused to return to the studio. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} There was a TV documentary about Jansch in 1993. Briggs took part in this and sang "Go Your Way My Love" as a duet with Jansch for the show. The recording later reappeared in the soundtrack "Acoustic Routes" (1993) on Demon Records. 

In recent years her material has been re-released on vinyl for Record Store Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.folkradio.co.uk/2016/08/interview-anne-briggs/|title=An Interview with Anne Briggs|last=Gallacher|first=Alex|date=12 August 2016|website=www.folkradio.co.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Influence==
Jansch described her as "one of the most underrated singers." He recorded Briggs' songs (including "Go Your Way, My Love" and "Wishing Well") on four of his albums. She was also his source for several of the traditional songs which he recorded, including "Blackwaterside." Jansch's instrumental accompaniment to this song was later copied and adapted by [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[Jimmy Page]], who recorded it as "[[Black Mountain Side]]."

Jansch and John Renbourn play "The Time Has Come" on their duo record before eventually recording it with the rest of Pentangle on the "Sweet Child" release. One song, "Mosaic Patterns," which she herself has never recorded, was recorded by blues singer, [[Dorris Henderson]]. [[Sandy Denny]] wrote a song in tribute to Briggs, called "The Pond and the Stream" on ''[[Fotheringay (album)|Fotheringay]]'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldilox.co.uk/engfolk/frames/anne_briggs.htm |title=Anne Briggs, UK folk singer |publisher=Goldilox.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The melody line from Briggs' version of '[[Willie O Winsbury]]' was used by [[Fairport Convention]] as the basis for the song [["Farewell, Farewell"]], from the 1969 album [[Liege and Lief]].

Briggs has been cited as a favourite of [[Eliza Carthy]], [[Kate Rusby]] and lead singer of [[Altan (band)|Altan]], [[Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} [[Charlotte Greig]] and the Scottish band [[James Yorkston and the Athletes]] have said Briggs was an influence on them.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} [[David Tibet]] of [[Current 93]] also recently mentioned her in an interview. {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The 2009 [[The Decemberists]] album, ''[[The Hazards of Love]]'', was inspired by Briggs's album of the same name.&lt;ref name="magnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2009/03/25/qa-with-the-decemberists-colin-meloy/|title=Q&amp;A With The Decemberists’ Colin Meloy|last=duBrowa|first=Corey |date=25 March 2009|publisher=[[Magnet (magazine)|Magnet]]|accessdate=6 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090415061035/http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2009/03/25/qa-with-the-decemberists-colin-meloy/| archivedate= 15 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chartattack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/features/69290/the-decemberists-hazardous-musical|title=The Decemberists' Hazardous Musical|last=White|first=Jen |date=5 May 2009|publisher=[[Chart Attack]]|accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Topic Records]] included in their 70th anniversary boxed set ''[[Three Score and Ten]]'' ''Blackwater Side'' from her eponymous album as track four of the second CD in the set.

The TV show [[Alias Grace]] uses her version of the song "Let No Man Steal Your Thyme" as the title theme.

Tambo|GCOT]] (née '''Betts'''; 6 October 1910 – 3 May 2002) was a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who was the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Blackburn (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackburn]] from [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945]] to [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979]], making her the longest-serving female MP in the history of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] until that record was broken in 2007 by [[Gwyneth Dunwoody]]. She later became the [[Member of the European Parliament]] for [[Greater Manchester]] from [[European Parliament election, 1979 (United Kingdom)|1979]] to [[European Parliament election, 1989 (United Kingdom)|1989]] and subsequently a member of the [[House of Lords]], having been granted a [[life peerage]] in 1990.

One of the most significant Labour Party politicians of the 20th century, Castle developed a close political partnership with [[Harold Wilson]] and served in several [[Cabinet (UK)|Cabinet]] roles during both his premierships. As [[Secretary of State for Transport|Minister of Transport]] (1965–1968) she oversaw the introduction of permanent speed limits, breathalysers and seat belts. Castle was then elevated to [[Secretary of State for Employment]] and [[First Secretary of State]] (1968–1970), and successfully intervened in the strike by [[Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968|Ford sewing machinists]] against pay discrimination. Following this Castle introduced the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]]. During her time in government Castle also served as [[Minister for Overseas Development]] and [[Secretary of State for Social Services|Secretary of State for Health and Social Services]]. 

==Early life==
Barbara Anne Betts was born on 6 October 1910 at 64 Derby Road, [[Chesterfield]], the youngest of three children to Frank Betts and his wife Annie Rebecca (née Ferrand).{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=3}} Raised in [[Pontefract]] and [[Bradford]], Castle grew up in a politically active home and was introduced to socialism from a young age. Her older sister, Marjorie, later became a pioneer of the [[Inner London Education Authority]], while their brother Tristram (almost always called Jimmie) engaged in field work with [[Oxfam]] in Nigeria. She joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] as a teenager.

Her father was a tax inspector, exempt from military service in the [[First World War]] due to his high rank in a [[reserved occupation]]. It was because of the nature of the tax-collecting profession, and the promotions he received, that the family frequently moved around the country. Having moved to [[Bradford]] in 1922, the Betts family swiftly became involved with the [[Independent Labour Party]]. Although her father was prohibited from formal political activity because of his role as a civil servant, he became editor of the ''[[Bradford Pioneer]]'', the city's socialist newspaper, after [[William Leach (Labour politician)|William Leach]] was elected to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935]].&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite news|author=Anne Perkins|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/politicsobituaries/story/0,,709885,00.html|title=Obituary: Baroness Castle of Blackburn|date=4 May 2002|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/famousperson/castle/2561817 |title=Barbara Castle |publisher=Lasting Tribute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726094629/http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/famousperson/castle/2561817 |archivedate=26 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Castle's mother ran the family home while also operating a soup kitchen for the town's coalminers. After Barbara had left home Annie was elected as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Councillor]] in Bradford.

==Education==
Castle attended Love Lane Elementary School, then to [[Pontefract and District Girls High School]]. After moving to Bradford at the age of twelve, she attended [[Bradford Girls' Grammar School]]. She became involved in acting at the school and developed oratorical skills. She excelled academically, winning numerous awards from the school. She also organised mock elections at the school, in which she stood as the Labour candidate. There were some aspects of the school that she did not like, notably the presence of many girls from rich families. In her last year she was appointed Head Girl.

Her education continued at [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]], from which she graduated with a [[third-class degree|third-class]] BA in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]]. She began serious political activity at Oxford, serving as the Treasurer of the [[Oxford University Labour Club]], the highest position a woman could hold in the club at the time. She struggled to accept the atmosphere of a university that had only recently begun to question iits traditionally sexist attitudes. She was scornful of the elitist nature of some elements of the institution, branding the [[Oxford Union]] "that cadet class of the establishment".

==Early career==
She was elected to [[Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras|St Pancras Metropolitan Borough Council]] in 1937, and in 1943 she spoke at the annual Labour Party Conference for the first time. Throughout the [[Second World War]] she worked as a senior administrative officer at the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] and she was an [[Air Raid Precautions in the United Kingdom|Air Raid Precautions]] (ARP) warden during [[the Blitz]].&lt;ref name="Derby"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/nostalgia/non-driver-derbyshire-born-mp-1866069|title=Non-Driver Derbyshire-Born MP Who Put Her Foot Down When It Came to Road Safety|first=Jim|last=Pickard|date=6 August 2018|accessdate=27 August 2018|work=[[Derby Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became a reporter on the left-wing magazine ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'', where she had a romantic relationship with [[William Mellor]], who was to become its editor, until his death in 1942.&lt;ref name="tribune-20140724"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribunemagazine.org/2014/07/how-cyril-smith-outwitted-barbara-castle-in-the-strange-case-of-the-paedophiles-at-the-home-office/ |title=How Cyril Smith Outwitted Barbara Castle in the Strange Case of the Paedophiles at the Home Office |author=Andrew Rosthorn |newspaper=Tribune |date=24 July 2014 |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her marriage to Ted Castle in 1944, she became the housing correspondent at the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''.&lt;ref name="tribune-20140724"/&gt;

==Member of Parliament (1945–1979)== 
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], which Labour won by a landslide, Castle was elected as the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Blackburn]]. As Blackburn was then a [[Multi-member constituencies in the Parliament of the United Kingdom|two-member constituency]],&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3576224/Sacred-monster.html|title=Sacred monster - Barbara Castle: 1910-2002|first=Gerald|last=Kaufman|date=5 May 2002|accessdate=27 August 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was elected alongside fellow Labour candidate [[John Edwards (English Labour politician)|John Edwards]]. Castle had secured her place as a parliamentary candidate through the women of the Blackburn Labour Party, who had threatened to quit unless she was added to the otherwise all-male shortlist.&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1393098/Lady-Castle-of-Blackburn.html

Castle now held the distinction of being the youngest of the handful of women elected.&lt;ref name="StatueBBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-43325442|title=Barbara Castle: Statue Plan to Honour Former Blackburn MP|date=8 March 2018|accessdate=27 August 2018|work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Throughout Castle's parliamentary career (1945–1979), women Members of Parliament consistently represented less than 5% of all MPs.&lt;ref name= women&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN01250.pdf|title= Women in Parliament and Government|date= 20 July 2018|publisher= House of Commons Library|accessdate= 26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} Although she had grown up in similar northern industrial towns, she had no prior connection to Blackburn.&lt;ref name="Derby"/&gt; Eager not to appear as a "[[parachute candidate]]", she studied [[weaving]] and [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]], and spent time living with a local family.&lt;ref name="Derby"/&gt; In her [[maiden speech]] she highlighted the problems facing servicemen then going through [[demobilisation]].&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph2"/&gt;

Immediately upon her entering the House of Commons Castle was appointed [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] (PPS) to [[Sir Stafford Cripps]], [[President of the Board of Trade]],&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph2"/&gt; who had known her as a member of the pre-war [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)|Socialist League]]. Harold Wilson succeeded Cripps in 1947 and retained Castle as his PPS, marking the beginning of the pair's lengthy political relationship.&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph2"/&gt; She gained further experience as the UK's alternate delegate to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] for 1949–1950, when she displayed particular concerned for social and humanitarian issues.&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph2"/&gt; She soon achieved a reputation as a left-winger and a rousing speaker. During the 1950s she was a high-profile [[Bevanism|Bevanite]], and made a name for herself as a vocal advocate of [[decolonisation]] and the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]].

===Cabinet minister===
====Minister for Overseas Development, 1964–1965====
[[File:Mr John Tembo Minister of Finance and Mrs Barbara Castle, Britain minister of oversea development.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Castle meeting [[John Tembo]], Malawi Minister of Finance (circa 1965)]]
Labour returned to government under [[Harold Wilson]] in October 1964 following a [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|general election]], defeating [[Alec Douglas-Home]]'s Conservative government by winning a slim majority of four seats, thus ending 13 years of successive Conservative governments. Wilson had selected his core Cabinet four months prior to the election;{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=161}} Castle knew Wilson intended to place her within his Cabinet, which would make her the fourth woman in British history ever to hold position in a Cabinet, after [[Margaret Bondfield]], [[Ellen Wilkinson]] and [[Florence Horsbrugh, Baroness Horsbrugh|Florence Horsbrugh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/m04c.pdf|title=Women in the House of Commons House of Commons: Information Office Factsheet M4|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Appendix C: Women MPs who have held Ministerial office|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Castle entered the Cabinet as the first [[Secretary of State for International Development|Minister for Overseas Development]], a newly created ministry for which she, alongside the [[Fabian Society]], had drawn up the plans for.{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=161}} For the last year she had acted as the opposition spokeswoman on overseas development.{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=161}} Castle's plans were extensive, though the ministry's budget was modest.{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=163}} She set about trying to divert powers from other departments related to overseas aid, including the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] and [[HM Treasury|the Treasury]]. She was only partially successful in her aims and provoked an internal Whitehall dispute in the process.{{sfnp|Mitchell|Wienir|1997|p=87}}

In June 1965 Castle announced interest-free aid loans would be available to certain (not exclusively [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]) countries.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=197}} She had previously criticised the Conservative government for granting loans that only waived up to the first seven years of interest, which she considered to be counter-intuitive.{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=175}} 

In August, Castle published her government [[white paper]] ''Overseas Development: The Work of a New Ministry''.{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=178}} The financial commitments of the ministry were omitted from the report, after a protracted clash between Castle and her Cabinet colleagues [[James Callaghan]] ([[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]) and [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] ([[Secretary of State for Economic Affairs]]). Labour had made a [[manifesto]] promise to increase aid spending to 1% of [[gross national product]], almost double Conservative spending.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|pp=197–198}} However, the national economy was unstable, public resentment towards the Commonwealth was growing due to immigration, and within Cabinet aid was viewed with either indifference or contempt.{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=175}} Castle grappled with Callaghan and Brown over the department's budgetary allocation; they reached a compromise following Wilson's intervention,{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=177}} but the sum only amounted to a small increase in spending.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|pp=199}}
 
====Minister of Transport, 1965–1968====
Initially reluctant to head up the department, Castle accepted the role of [[Secretary of State for Transport|Minister of Transport]] (23 December 1965 – 6 April 1968) in a [[Cabinet reshuffle]] after Wilson proved persuasive.&lt;ref name="NewStatesman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/150817|title=The New Statesman Interview - Barbara Castle|first=Steve|last=Richards|date=28 February 2000|accessdate=28 August 2018|work=[[New Statesman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She introduced the [[breathalyser]] to combat the then recently acknowledged crisis of [[drink-driving]]. Castle said she was "ready to risk unpopularity" by introducing the measures if it meant saving lives.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/470a8d67-8f94-3361-a223-30c3bfa37e65|title=BBC to Barbara Castle: "You're only a woman... what do you know about it?"|first=Jim|last=Pickard|date=1 March 2010|accessdate=27 August 2018|work=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was challenged by a [[BBC]] journalist on ''[[The World This Weekend]]'', who described the policy as a "rotten idea" and asked her: "You're only a woman, you don't drive, what do you know about it?"&lt;ref name="FT"/&gt; 

Castle also made permanent the [[Road speed limits in the United Kingdom|national speed limit]] (70&amp;nbsp;mph). Having been introduced as a four-month trial by outgoing Transport Minister [[Tom Fraser]] in December 1965, Castle first extended the limit period in 1966 and in 1967 made the limit permanent, following the findings of a [[Road Research Laboratory]] report revealing motorway casualties had fallen 20% since its introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://moneyweek.com/419950/22-december-1965-70mph-speed-limit-introduced/|title=22 December 1965: 70mph speed limit introduced

[[File:Humber Bridge under construction - geograph.org.uk - 1599900.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Castle authorised the construction of the Humber Bridge (pictured in 1980, prior to completion)]]Castle also sanctioned the construction of the [[Humber Bridge]],&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph"/&gt; which was the world's longest suspension bridge upon its opening in 1981.&lt;ref name="HumberBridge"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/sep/17/strachan-stockwell-humber-bridge|title=How we made the Humber Bridge|first=Dave|last=Simpson|date=17 September 2012|accessdate=28 August 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1965, the Labour MP for nearby [[Kingston upon Hull North (UK Parliament constituency)|Hull North]] died, [[Hull North by-election, 1966|triggering a by-election]]. The marginal seat was of critical importance to the government and its loss would have reduced Labour's majority in the House of Commons to just one.&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph"/&gt; Harold Wilson invoked Castle to find the necessary funding and promise the bridge's construction as an 'election sweetener'.&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph"/&gt; The move paid off, with Labour holding the seat.

She presided over the closure of approximately 2,050 miles of railways as she enacted her part of the [[Beeching axe|Beeching cuts]]—a betrayal of pre-election commitments by the Labour party to halt the proposals. Nevertheless, she refused closure of several lines, one example being the [[Looe Valley Line]] in Cornwall, and introduced the first Government [[rail subsidies]] for socially necessary but unprofitable railways in the Transport Act 1968.

One of her most memorable achievements as Transport minister was to pass legislation decreeing that all new cars had to be fitted with [[seat belt]]s. Despite being appointed to the Ministry of Transport, a role which she was originally unenthusiastic about, Castle could not actually drive herself, and was chauffeured to functions. (The Labour politician [[Hazel Blears]] recalled driving Castle at one time as a young Labour Party activist in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labourhistory.org.uk/?p=63 Hazel Blears’ memories of Barbara Castle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319125818/http://www.labourhistory.org.uk/?p=63 |date=19 March 2008 }}, The Labour History Group, 20 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;) Despite her lack of a driving licence, she attracted controversy when she told local government leaders to give added emphasis to motor vehicle access in urban areas, as "most pedestrians are walking to or from their cars."{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Castle and her husband Edward Castle had bought a new flat in John Spencer Square in late 1967 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.roads.org.uk/ringways/ringway1/north-cross-route|title=North Cross Route|website=Roads.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;while she was the Minister of Transport.

====First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Employment, 1968–1970====
As [[Secretary of State for Employment]], she was also appointed [[First Secretary of State]] by Wilson, bringing her firmly into the heart of government. She was never far from controversy which reached a fever pitch when the trade unions rebelled against her proposals to reduce their powers in her 1969 [[white paper]], '[[In Place of Strife]]'. This also involved a major cabinet split, with threatened resignations, hot tempers and her future nemesis [[James Callaghan]] breaking ranks to publicly try to undermine the bill. The whole episode alienated her from many of her friends on the left, with the [[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]] newspaper railing very hard against the bill, which they held to be attacking the workers without attacking the bosses. The split is often said to be partly responsible for Labour's defeat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]]. The eventual deal with the unions dropped most of the contentious clauses.

Castle also helped make history when she intervened in the [[Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968|Ford sewing machinists' strike of 1968]], in which the women of the [[Dagenham Ford Plant]] demanded to be paid the same as their male counterparts. She helped resolve the strike, which resulted in a pay rise for Ford's female workers bringing them to 92% of what the men received. Most significantly, as a consequence of this strike, Castle put through the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unionhistory.info/timeline/Tl_Display.php?Where=Dc1Title+contains+'Ford+sewing+machinists,+1968'|title=TUC {{!}} History Online|website=www.unionhistory.info|access-date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 British film, ''[[Made in Dagenham]]'', was based on the Ford strike. She was portrayed by [[Miranda Richardson]].

In April 1970, Castle's husband Ted lost his position as an alderman of the [[Greater London Council]]. He was devastated and although he was supportive of his wife’s achievements, he considered himself a failure against her.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=339}} Upset and concerned by her husband's distress, Barbara moved to persuade Wilson to grant Ted a peerage.&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph2"/&gt;

===Opposition===
In May 1970, Wilson [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|called a general election]], held on 18 June. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], led by [[Edward Heath]], enjoyed a surprise victory, despite opinion polling indicating a steady lead for Labour in the run-up.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=344}} Castle privately blamed complacency within Labour for their loss and had expressed skepticism of their poll lead, writing in her diaries: "I have a haunting feeling there is a silent majority sitting behind its lace curtains waiting to come out and vote Tory."{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=344}} 

In the immediate aftermath of the government's defeat, Castle found she was out of favour with Wilson. The day following the general election, Wilson held a final inner Cabinet meeting at [[Downing Street]], to which Castle was not invited.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=345}} Eager to make contact, she later called him at [[Chequers]], where Wilson engaged in a brusque telephone conversation with her.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=345}} 

Refusing to acknowledge her career had been curtailed, Castle proposed to run for deputy leadership of the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]].{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=347}} When she informed Wilson of her plans he was furious; Castle's reputation within the party had been damaged by the failure of ''[[In Place of Strife]]'' and Wilson censured her, claiming her plan would split the party.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=347}} In an act of retribution for her challenge to the deputy leadership, Wilson impeded Ted Castle's peerage, which he had all but promised prior to the general election.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=348}} 

Castle remained as the Labour shadow spokesperson on Employment. The new Government introduced many of her policy suggestions as part of their Industrial Relations Act. When she was attacking the Conservative bill, the government simply pointed to her own white paper, following which Wilson reshuffled her first to the health portfolio and then out of the shadow cabinet.

===Return to Cabinet===
====Secretary of State for Health and Social Services, 1974–1976====
In 1974, after [[Harold Wilson]]'s defeat of [[Edward Heath]], Castle became [[Secretary of State for Social Services|Secretary of State for Health and Social Services]]. While serving in this position, Castle introduced a wide range of innovative welfare reforms, including the introduction of the mobility allowance, the [[Carer's Allowance|Invalid Care Allowance]] (July 1976) for single women and others who give up their jobs to care for severely disabled relatives, the introduction of a non-contributory invalidity pension for disabled persons who had not qualified for invalidity pension, reforms in child allowances, and the linking of most social security benefits to earnings rather than prices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Seldon]] and Kevin Hickson (eds), ''New Labour, Old Labour: The Wilson and Callaghan Governments, 1974–79''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom referendum, 1975|1975 referendum debate]] she took a [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] stance. During a debate with Liberal leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]] he asked her whether, if the vote would be yes, she would stay on as a minister. To this she replied: "If the vote is yes my country will need me to save it."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Nj0u_pnAw_s|Barbara Castle Labour's Greatest Woman, video}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her views she later became a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (1979–1989).

[[File:James Callaghan.JPG|thumb|right|200px|James Callaghan removed Castle from his Cabinet]]In 1975, Castle introduced the Child Benefit Act, superseding the [[Family Allowances Act 1945]].&lt;ref name="BBCchildbenefit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11465116|title=Q&amp;A: Child benefit changes|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=3 September 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act provided new support for families' first child, unlike the previous system in place, which provided benefit for second and subsequent children.&lt;ref name="BBCchildbenefit"/&gt; Castle also ensured [[Child benefits in the United Kingdom|child benefit]] would be paid directly to mothers, not fathers, unlike Family Allowance, the previous system in place.&lt;ref name="RedQueenPink"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/sep/25/1|title=Red queen in the pink|first=Anne|last=Perkins|date=25 September 1999|accessdate=3 September 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation faced opposition from unions whose male members would receive less take-home pay with the loss of Family Allowance.&lt;ref name="RedQueenPink"/&gt;

Castle remained in cabinet until Wilson's resignation in March 1976. The head of the [[Downing Street policy unit]], [[Bernard Donoughue]], records in his diary that he warned Wilson that Castle's dogged pursuit of personal policy stances on public health would "wreck the NHS". Donoughue claims that Wilson agreed, but admitted he would leave it to his successor to resolve.&lt;ref&gt;''Downing Street Diary: with Harold Wilson at no.10''. Jonathan Cape, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-224-04022-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Castle lost her place as a Cabinet minister when her bitter political enemy [[James Callaghan]] succeeded Wilson as Prime Minister following a [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1976|leadership election]]. Although he left Wilson's Cabinet virtually unchanged, he dismissed Castle almost immediately upon taking office.&lt;ref name="CallaghanObit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/1486556/Lord-Callaghan-of-Cardiff.html|title=Lord Callaghan of Cardiff|date=28 March 2005|accessdate=3 September 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Callaghan removed her under the pretext he wanted to lower the average age of his Cabinet,&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2002/05/06/barbara-castle-91/7ad94886-d4c5-4d59-b33c-c82257653aa0|title=Barbara Castle, 91|first=Richard|last=Pearson|date=6 May 2002|accessdate=3 September 2018|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she regarded as a "phoney reason".&lt;ref name="BBC2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/946997.stm|title=Barbara Castle: Scaling the ramparts|first=Chris|last=Jones|date=29 September 2000|accessdate=3 September 2018|work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview years later, she remarked that perhaps the most restrained thing she had ever achieved in her life was not to reply with "Then why not start with yourself, Jim?" (Callaghan was four years older than Wilson, the man he was replacing).{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==European Parliament (1979–1989)==
Despite her [[Eurosceptic]] stance, less than a month after leaving Westminster at the 1979 general election she stood for and was elected to the [[European Parliament]], writing in the ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' that "politics is not just about policies: it is about fighting for them in every available forum and at every opportunity." In 1982 she wrote in the ''New Statesman'' that Labour should abandon its opposition to British membership of the EEC, saying that Britain should fight its corner inside it.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Castle, ‘Let them throw us out’, ''New Statesman'' (17 September 1982), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; This led her former ally [[Ian Mikardo]] to say to her: "Your name is mud".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (10 June 1993), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

She represented [[Greater Manchester North (European Parliament constituency)|Greater Manchester North]] from 1979–1984, and was then elected for another five years to represent [[Greater Manchester West (European Parliament constituency)|Greater Manchester West]] from 1984–1989. She was, at that time, the only British MEP to have held a cabinet position.

In the European Parliament Castle led Labour's delegation, serving as vice-chair of the Socialist Group and as a member of the [[Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development|Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development]] and also the Delegation for relations with [[Malta]].

In 1974, [[Edward Castle, Baron Castle|Ted Castle]] was made a life peer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JcastleT.htm |title=Ted Castle |publisher=Spartacus Educational |date=16 December 1979 |accessdate=24 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004174228/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JcastleT.htm |archivedate=4 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that Barbara was now formally Lady Castle, but she refused to use this courtesy title. Ted Castle died in 1979. In 1990, she was made a [[life peer]] in her own right, as '''Baroness Castle of Blackburn'''. She remained active in politics right up until her death, attacking the then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]], [[Gordon Brown]], at the Labour party conference in 2001 for his refusal to link pensions to earnings.

Castle was a critic of [[Blairism]] and "[[New Labour]]", in particular with Blairite economic ideologies, which she perceived to be acceptance of "[[market economics]], unchallenged [[globalisation]] and the dominance of the [[Multinational corporation|multinationals]]".&lt;ref name="NewStatesman"/&gt; She also accused Blairites of distorting and dismissing the Labour Party's past, stating in an interview published in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine in 2000, the party's centenary:&lt;blockquote&gt;"They do not seem to have realised that all governments, whatever their complexion, end in apparent failure. [[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan]] was triumphant in 1959 and was biting the dust shortly afterwards. [[Edward Heath|Heath]] won in 1970 and spent three and half years doing U-turns, looking for the perfect answer. [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] was a remarkable woman, but her premiership ended in ignominy. But the current leadership seems preoccupied by the failing of Labour in power and in opposition."&lt;ref name="NewStatesman"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death==
Barbara Castle died in [[Chiltern (district)|Chiltern]], [[Buckinghamshire]], on 3 May 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp|title=Deaths England and Wales 1984–2006|publisher=Findmypast.com|date=|accessdate=24 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090627024414/http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp| archivedate= 27 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; of pneumonia and chronic lung disease.

==Legacy==
Castle has been acknowledged as the most important female Labour politician of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt; An adept and gripping orator,&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph2"/&gt;{{sfnp|Crines|Hayton|2015|pp=62–63}} Castle garnered a reputation as a strong-willed,&lt;ref name="Hattersley"/&gt; sometimes single-minded crusader.&lt;ref name="Kavanagh"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3597104/She-craved-the-limelight.html|title=She craved the limelight|first=Dennis|last=Kavanagh|date=23 June 2003|accessdate=30 August 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political commentator [[Andrew Marr]] wrote of Castle in 1993: "Performance has been at the centre of her career. She makes excellent television and was a good Commons speaker. But she was really made for the platform, either at Labour conferences or during election campaigns. There, her wit, self-confidence and theatricality were displayed. A good Castle speech is unforgettable."&lt;ref name="AndrewMarr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/book-review-the-lady-of-hell-corner-farm-andrew-marr-on-barbara-castles-memoirs-full-of-rough-and-1484011.html|title=BOOK REVIEW / The lady of Hell Corner Farm: Andrew Marr on Barbara Castle's memoirs|first=Andrew|last=Marr|date=10 July 1993|accessdate=29 August 2018|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She was admired by [[Bill Deedes]], Conservative politician and editor of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', for "her astonishing tenacity, her capacity for getting her own way in Cabinet and nearly everywhere else,"&lt;ref name="Deedes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/may/05/labour.politicalcolumnists|title=Barbara the brave - a women to reckon with|first=Roy|last=Hattersley|date=5 May 2002|accessdate=29 August 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he derided her politics.&lt;ref name="Deedes"/&gt; To her allies, Castle was loyal and would fiercely defend them.&lt;ref name="Deedes"/&gt; Colleague [[Roy Hattersley]] credited her with saving his career by insisting he remain her junior Minister when Harold Wilson attempted to sack him.&lt;ref name="Hattersley"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/wfdeedes/1560750/Deedes-on-Barbara-Castle.html|title=Deedes on Barbara Castle|first=Bill|last=Deedes|date=20 August 2007|accessdate=29 August 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, she remained unforgiving of her enemies; when questioned on [[James Callaghan]] in a 2000 interview in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', Castle said: "I think it is safest all round if I don't comment on him."&lt;ref name="NewStatesman"/&gt;

Referred to disparagingly by fellow Labour MP [[Gerald Kaufman]] as "the [[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Norma Desmond]] of politics [...] always ready for her close-up",&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph"/&gt; she was noted for always paying particular attention to her appearance.&lt;ref name="Kinnock"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/how-we-met-neil-kinnock-and-barbara-castle-1490065.html|title=How we met: Neil Kinnock and Barbara Castle|first=Louise|last=Baring|date=6 June 1993|accessdate=30 August 2018|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variously described as sophisticated, stylish and glamorous,&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinnock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/jan/22/uk.comment|title=The red Baroness|first=Linda|last=Grant|date=22 January 1995|accessdate=31 August 2018|work=[[The Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castle was also characterised as vain,&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt; while her critics called her egocentric.&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3579217/One-final-thought-Our-Barbara-had-many-faults.html|title=One final thought: 'Our Barbara' had many faults|first=Robert|last=Harris|date=16 July 2002|accessdate=31 August 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Labour leader [[Neil Kinnock]] recalled she was distraught when her hairdresser cancelled before a television appearance;&lt;ref name="Kinnock"/&gt; in response, Castle said: "If you're a woman in the public eye, getting your hair nice is a constant preoccupation."&lt;ref name="Kinnock"/&gt; Her weekly appointments with her hairdresser were "an essential Friday engagement" according to Hattersley,&lt;ref name="Hattersley"/&gt; although she occasionally wore a wig – which she nicknamed Lucy – for public appearances without the benefit of her hairdresser to hand.&lt;ref name="Deedes"/&gt;
 
In 2008, Castle was named by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as one of four of "Labour's greatest heroes"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labourconference.labour "Labour's greatest hero: Barbara Castle"], ''The Guardian'', 19 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 she was named on  [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' Power List as one of seven women judged to have had the biggest impact on women's lives over the past 70 years, alongside [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Helen Brook]], [[Germaine Greer]], [[Jayaben Desai]], [[Bridget Jones]], and [[Beyoncé]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38303886 "Margaret Thatcher tops Woman's Hour Power List"], BBC News (Arts &amp; Entertainment), 14 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Several women politicians have cited Castle as an inspiration for embarking on their careers, including Shadow Foreign Secretary [[Emily Thornberry]],&lt;ref name="Thornberry"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43925289|title=Political heroes: Emily Thornberry on Barbara Castle|first=Elizabeth|last=Glinka|date=27 April 2018|accessdate=30 August 2018|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tulip Siddiq]], and former Conservative MP [[Edwina Curry]].&lt;ref name="Observer"/&gt;

Since Castle's death there have been several plans mooted to memorialise her with a statue in her constituency town of Blackburn, most recently in 2018.&lt;ref name="StatueBBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StatueGuardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/jun/04/uk.labour|title=Statue keeps Castle's flame burning|first=Anne|last=Perkins|date=4 June 2004|accessdate=29 August 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/1711030.Baroness_Castle_statue_plan_shelved/|title=Baroness Castle statue plan shelved

She appears on the 81p denomination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalmail.com/portal/stamps/jump1?catId=32200669&amp;mediaId=82400737 Women of Distinction: 81p Stamp – Barbara Castle]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Royal Mail&lt;/ref&gt;

Castle was portrayed by British actress [[Miranda Richardson]] in the 2010 film ''[[Made in Dagenham]]'', dealing with the 1968 strike at the [[Ford Dagenham assembly plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Singh|first=Anita|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/cannes-film-festival/5335785/Sally-Hawkins-to-star-in-strike-film-We-Want-Sex.html|title=Sally Hawkins to star in strike film We Want Sex|work=Daily Telegraph|date=16 May 2009|accessdate=24 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090523100007/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/cannes-film-festival/5335785/Sally-Hawkins-to-star-in-strike-film-We-Want-Sex.html| archivedate= 23 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later portrayed by stage actress [[Sophie-Louise Dann]] in the 2014 West End [[Made in Dagenham (musical)|musical adaptation of the film]].

==Honours and awards==
Barbara Castle was the recipient of "The Order of the Companions of [[Oliver Tambo|OR Tambo]] in Silver", a South African award to foreign nationals for friendship with that country. In a statement the South African government recognised Castle's "outstanding contribution to the struggle against apartheid and the establishment of a non-sexist, non-racial and democratic South Africa".&lt;ref name="thepresidency.gov.za"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/orders_list.asp?show=214 |title=The Order of the Companions of OR Tambo in Silver – Profile of Barbara Castle |publisher=The Presidency – Republic of South Africa |date= |accessdate=24 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719021558/http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/orders_list.asp?show=214 |archivedate=19 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen throughout Castle's career with her active support for the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) in Britain from the very start of its existence and her continued interest and devotion to colonial issues within Parliament.&lt;ref name="thepresidency.gov.za"/&gt;

In 2002 Castle was posthumously awarded an honorary degree from the [[Open University]]. The award, Doctor of the University, was presented for Public Services for works in areas of special educational concern to the OU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=441 "OU honours Barbara Castle"], ''The Open University'', 1 July 2002. Retrieved 8 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Castle also received a [[Bundesverdienstkreuz|Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1990, for services to European democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/cawp/UK%20bios/UK_bios_40s.htm#bcastle|work=Centre for Advancement of Women in Politics |publisher=Queen's University|title=WOMEN MPs ELECTED 1940s|accessdate=24 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008 Northern Rail, Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council and PTEG ([[Passenger transport executive]] Group) named a train after her. The plaque was unveiled by Barbara's niece, Sonya Hinton, and [[Ruth Kelly]] MP (then Secretary of State for Transport). A [https://web.archive.org/web/20081120200025/http://www.pteg.net/barbaracastle commemorative brochure] of the event was produced by PTEG.

      <comment>The German police during the Nazi regime was not a part of the Nazi party, like the Gestapo or the SS, which were indeed Nazi institutions themselves. If the Police was a Nazi Police, the sentence would need a reference. Anyway, Nazi implies a political party affiliation that is not relevant for the article.</comment>

'''Bruno Lüdke''' (3 April 1908 – 8 April 1944) was an alleged [[Germany|German]] [[serial killer]]. Police officials connected him to at least 51&amp;nbsp;murder victims, mainly women, killed in a 15-year period, which began in 1928 and ended with his arrest in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Philip Jenkins |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9389345/Bruno-Ludke |title=Bruno Lüdke |publisher=Britannica |date=1944-04-08 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was never given a trial, and is generally considered innocent these days.&lt;ref&gt;Florian Stark: ''[https://www.welt.de/geschichte/article180948928/Hinrichtung-So-starb-der-groesste-Serienmoerder-der-Kriminalgeschichte.html So starb der größte Serienmörder der Kriminalgeschichte]'', [[Die Welt]], 13 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
Born in [[Köpenick]], Lüdke had a mild intellectual disability (he could not, for example, tell interrogators how many minutes there were in an hour) and worked as a [[coachman]]. He was well known by the local police as a petty thief and [[Voyeurism|peeping tom]]. On 31 January 1943 a woman was found murdered in the woods near Köpenick, strangled with her own shawl. The victim showed signs of post-mortem sexual abuse and her purse was missing. Police brought in Lüdke for questioning on 18 March 1943, where he quickly confessed to murdering not only the woman but also several other victims, and was taken into custody. Witnesses report Lüdke showed signs of physical abuse and he stated that 'they would kill me if I didn't confess'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.axishistory.com/index.php?id=2969 |title=Bruno Lüdke – A serial killer? |publisher=Axishistory.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Lüdke was never put on trial for any of the killings. Declared [[insane]], he was sent to the [[SS]]-run 'Institute of Criminological Medicine' in [[Vienna]], where medical experiments were carried out on him until his death when an experiment went wrong in 1944.

==Controversy==
The 50-odd crime scenes showed no similarities in [[modus operandi]], signature, or motive. No fingerprints were ever found and no evidence against Lüdke has ever been presented.

A [[Netherlands|Dutch]] former Chief of police named Jan Blaauw took an interest in the case and investigated original police reports. He found them inconclusive, incoherent, and vague. He also expressed his disbelief that a semi-illiterate, who once got caught stealing a chicken, could evade authorities for nearly 20 years, let alone get away with murder.

Many believe Lüdke to be the victim of a frame-up, carried out by an ambitious Kriminalkommissar (Detective Captain) Franz, the heavily censored [[Reichskriminalpolizeiamt]], and the Nazi government, that had little patience with people with intellectual disabilities. {{cn|date=July 2016}}

A 1957 movie, ''[[The Devil Strikes at Night|Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam]]'', affirmed the image of Lüdke as one of Germany's worst serial killers. Attempts at reopening the case by members of the Kriminalrat (Detective Major) Faulhaber yielded no results. The true nature of the 51 murders remains unsolved to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Charles A L Totten.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Charles A. L. Totten]]
'''Charles Adelle Lewis Totten''' (February 3, 1851 – April 12, 1908) was an American [[military]] officer, a professor of military tactics, a prolific writer, and an influential early advocate of [[British Israelism]].

==Family==

Charles Totten was born in [[New London, Connecticut]] into a military family.  His father, [[James Totten]] was a 1st lieutenant in the Army and would become a [[Brigadier-General]] in the Missouri Militia during the [[American Civil War]].  He was the grandfather of Lieutenant General [[William P. Ennis]] who served during [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]].  He was not directly related to Brevet Major General [[Joseph Gilbert Totten]], who was Chief of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] from 1838 to 1864.  

Totten's brother, John Reynolds Totten, graduated from West Point in 1878, was promoted to first lieutenant in 1886 and resigned from the Army on April 1, 1891. After leaving the Army, he pursued his interests in genealogy and hereditary societies.

Totten was appointed to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point on September 1, 1869.  A year later, his father was dismissed from the Army for misconduct.

==Military career==
Totten graduated from [[West Point]] (where he had been an honor student) in June 1873.  He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Artillery Regiment.  He was promoted to first lieutenant the next year.  He would not be promoted again, however, due to slow promotions in the post-Civil War Army.

He taught military science and tactics at [[Massachusetts Agricultural College]], (now known as the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]) from 1875 to 1878.  In this assignment he introduced fencing as a collegiate sport.

Charles Totten and W. R. Livermore are variously credited with being the first to bring the practice of [[wargaming|war gaming]] from Germany to the United States.  Totten's book ''Strategos'', one of the first modern wargaming systems in the United States, was published in 1880.

In 1881 Totten participated in the [[Chiricahua Campaign]] against the [[Apache]]s in Arizona.  For this service, Totten was entitled to receive the [[Indian Campaign Medal]] when it was established in 1907.

He was stationed at [[Fort Adams]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] from November 9, 1882 to August 1, 1883.  He then served as Professor of Military Science and Tactics, Cathedral School of St. Paul in New York from August 4, 1883 until April 21, 1886.  A strong opponent of the [[Metric System]], he patented a system of weights and measures in 1884.

He was again assigned to [[Fort Adams]], as well as serving as an advisor at Rhode Island Militia encampments, from May 30, 1886 until October 1, 1889.  His last assignment in the Army was as Professor of Military Science and Tactics at [[Yale University]] from August 1, 1889 until 1892.

==Writing and Publishing==

After a leave of absence, Totten resigned his commission in August 1893 and settled in [[Milford, Connecticut]] with his office in New Haven.   He devoted most of his remaining life to writing, chiefly on [[biblical chronology]], [[biblical prophecy]], the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]], [[British Israelism]], the symbolism of the [[Great Seal of the United States]] and other esoteric subjects.

He was a prolific author, writing over 180 books and articles, including a massive 26 volume series entitled "Our Race" defending [[British Israelism]], and his writings continue to exert influence in some [[Christian Zionism|Christian Zionist]] circles.  Totten's works were read and embraced by [[Mary Baker Eddy]], the founder of the [[Christian Science]] Church.  British Israelism was later embraced by [[Herbert W. Armstrong]], founder of the [[Worldwide Church of God]] and the [[white supremacist]] [[Christian Identity]] movement.

As an active member of the International Institute for Preserving and Perfecting (Anglo-Saxon) Weights and Measures, Totten wrote its theme song, "A Pint's a Pound the World Around," in 1883, which included these lines:&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Metric System Controversy in the United States. U.S. Metric Study Tenth Interim Report.  National Bureau of Standards (DOC) , Washington, D.C. 
REPORT NO NBs-SP-345-10 August 1971. 307p.

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
They bid us change the ancient "names."
The "seasons" and the "times;"
And for our measures go abroad
To strange and distant climes.
But well abide by things long clear
And cling to things of yore.
For the Anglo-Saxon race shall rule
The earth from shore to shore.
Then down with every "metric" scheme
Taught by the foreign school.
We'll worship still our Father's God!
And keep our Father's "rule"!
A perfect inch. a perfect pint.
The Anglo's honest pound.
Shall hold their place upon the earth.
Till Time's last trump shall sound!
CHORUS:
Then swell the chorus heartily.
Let every Saxon sing:
"A pint's a pound the world around."
Till all the earth shall ring.
"A pint's a pound the world around"
For rich and poor the same;
Just measure and a perfect weight
Called by their ancient name!
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Steele was recruited by [[MI6]] directly following his graduation from Cambridge, working in London at the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] (FCO) from 1987 to 1989.&lt;ref name="Dip1996" /&gt; From 1990 to 1993, Steele worked under diplomatic cover as an [[MI6]] agent in Moscow, serving at the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom in Moscow]].&lt;ref name="Mayer_3/12/2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tg-who-is"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rayner|first1=Gordon|title=Who is Christopher Steele, the former British spy who created the Donald Trump Russia dossier?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/12/christopher-steelethe-former-british-spy-created-donald-trump/|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=16 January 2017|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steele was an "internal traveller", visiting newly-accessible cities such as [[Samara]] and [[Kazan]].&lt;ref name="web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dsma"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/en_au/read/uk-asks-journalists-to-not-name-ex-agent-allegedly-behind-trump-report-d-notice |publisher=''[[Vice News]]'' |title=UK Asks Journalists to Not Name Ex-Agent Allegedly Behind Trump Report |first=Joseph |last=Cox |date=13 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113162731/http://motherboard.vice.com/en_au/read/uk-asks-journalists-to-not-name-ex-agent-allegedly-behind-trump-report-d-notice |archive-date=13 January 2017 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cryptome.org/mi6-list.htm |publisher=[[Cryptome]] |archive-date=6 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106222014/http://cryptome.org/mi6-list.htm |title=List of MI6 Officers |quote=Christopher David Steele: 90 Moscow; dob 1964. |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to London in 1993, working again at the FCO until his posting with the British Embassy in Paris in 1998, where he served [[under cover|under diplomatic cover]] until 2002.

In 2003, Steele was sent to [[Bagram Airfield]] in Afghanistan as part of an MI6 team, briefing [[Special Forces]] on "kill or capture" missions for [[Taliban]] targets, and also spent time teaching new MI6 recruits.&lt;ref name=tg-who-is /&gt; Steele returned to London and between 2006 and 2009 he headed the Russia Desk at MI6.&lt;ref name="Mayer_3/12/2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vouch"&gt;{{cite news|author=Nick Hopkins &amp; Luke Harding|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/12/intelligence-sources-vouch-credibility-donald-trump-russia-dossier-author|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Donald Trump dossier: intelligence sources vouch for author's credibility|date=12 January 2017|quote=Over a career that spanned more than 20 years, Steele performed a series of roles, but always appeared to be drawn back to Russia; he was, sources say, head of MI6's Russia desk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steele's expertise on Russia remained valued, and he served as a senior officer under [[John Scarlett]], Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), from 2004 to 2009.&lt;ref name="vouch" /&gt; Steele was selected as [[case officer]] for [[Alexander Litvinenko]] and participated in the investigation of the [[poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko|Litvinenko poisoning]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=tg-who-is /&gt; It was Steele who quickly realised that Litvinenko's death "was a Russian state 'hit{{' "}}.&lt;ref name="vouch" /&gt; Twelve years later he allegedly was included himself into a hit list of the Russian [[Federal Security Service]], along with [[Sergei Skripal]] who was [[Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal|poisoned in 2018]] by a binary chemical weapon [[Novichok]] in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russian-ex-spy-says-he-was-kremlin-hit-list-along-n860641|title=Russian ex-spy says he was on Kremlin 'hit list' along with poisoned Skripal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009 Steele has not been to Russia, or visited any former Soviet states and in 2012, an Orbis informant quoted an FSB-agent describing him as an "enemy of Mother Russia".&lt;ref name="Mayer_3/12/2018"/&gt; Steele has refrained from travelling to the United States since his identity became public, citing the political and legal situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Sky News]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011172925/https://news.sky.com/story/trump-dossier-author-christopher-steele-breaks-18-month-silence-11522468 |archive-date=October 11, 2018 |title=Ex-MI6 spy's veiled swipe at Donald Trump revealed |date=October 10, 2018 |first=Deborah |last=Haynes |url=https://news.sky.com/story/trump-dossier-author-christopher-steele-breaks-18-month-silence-11522468 |quote=The former intelligence officer indicated he is unable to travel to the US at a time of deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over the Russia probe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Steele with his fellow MI6-retiree Chris Burrows co-founded the [[private intelligence agency]] Orbis Business Intelligence, Ltd., based in [[Grosvenor Square|Grosvenor Square Gardens]].&lt;ref name="hose"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-steele-idUSKBN14W0HN |quote=After he left the spy service, Steele supplied the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with information on corruption at FIFA, international soccer's governing body. |title=Former MI-6 spy known to U.S. agencies is author of reports on Trump in Russia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112171056/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-steele-idUSKBN14W0HN |archive-date=12 January 2017 |first=Mark |last=Hosenball |agency=Reuters |date=12 January 2017 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VF" &gt;{{cite news |publisher=''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' |access-date=3 April 2017 |first=Howard |last=Blum |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403115858/http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/how-the-explosive-russian-dossier-was-compiled-christopher-steele |archive-date=3 April 2017 |date=April 2017 |title=How Ex-Spy Christopher Steele Compiled His Explosive Trump-Russia Dossier |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/how-the-explosive-russian-dossier-was-compiled-christopher-steele}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2014 and 2016, Steele created over 100 reports on Russian and Ukrainian issues, which were read within the [[United States Department of State]], and he was viewed as credible by the [[United States intelligence community]].&lt;ref name="web"/&gt; The business was commercially successful, grossing approximately $20,000,000 in the first nine years of operation.&lt;ref name="Mayer_3/12/2018"/&gt;

Steele ran an investigation dubbed "Project Charlemagne", which noted Russian interference in the domestic politics of [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Mayer_3/12/2018"/&gt; Steele concluded in April 2016 that Russia was engaged in an [[information warfare]] campaign with the goal of destroying the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="Mayer_3/12/2018"/&gt;

===FIFA research===
In 2010, [[The Football Association]] (FA), England's domestic football governing body, organized a [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|committee]] in hopes of hosting the 2018 or 2022 World Cups.&lt;ref name="fifa"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/opinion/sunday/world-cup-fifa-corruption-russia.html |title=Did Russia Steal the World Cup? |date=6 June 2018 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |first=Ken |last=Bensinger |access-date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FA hired Steele's company to investigate [[FIFA]] (International Federation of Association Football).

==2017 Trump dossier==
{{Main|Trump–Russia dossier}}

===Background and information gathering===
In September 2015, the ''[[Washington Free Beacon]]'', a conservative publication, retained the services of [[Fusion GPS]], a private Washington D.C. political [[research]] firm, to conduct research on several primary Republican Party candidates including candidate Trump. The research was unrelated to Russia and was ended once Trump was determined to be the presidential nominee.

The firm was subsequently hired by the Hillary Clinton Campaign and the [[Democratic National Committee]] through their shared attorney at Perkins Coie, Marc Elias. Fusion GPS then hired Steele&lt;ref name="tg-terrified"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rayner|first1=Gordon|title=Former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, who produced Donald Trump Russian dossier, 'terrified for his safety' and went to ground before name released|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/11/former-mi6-officer-produced-donald-trump-russian-dossier-terrified/|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=16 January 2017|date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to investigate Trump's Russia-related activities.&lt;ref name="hose" /&gt; According to [[CNN]], [[Hillary Clinton]]'s campaign and the [[Democratic National Committee]] took over the financing of the inquiry into Donald Trump and produced what became known as the Trump dossier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krieg|first1=Gregory|title=Clinton, the DNC and the making of the 'Trump dossier' – what we know|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/26/politics/trump-clinton-podesta-steele-dossier-fusion-gps/|website=CNN|accessdate=28 October 2017|date=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Steele supplied a report he had written to an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/12/lurid-donald-trump-dossier-casts-shadow-mi6-christopher-steele/ |title=Donald Trump dossier casts a shadow over MI6 and Christopher Steele, the man it trusted in Moscow |website=Telegraph.co.uk |date=12 January 2017 |accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contact at the FBI was the same senior agent with whom he had worked when investigating the FIFA scandal.&lt;ref name="tg-who-is" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayer_3/12/2018"/&gt;

In September 2016, Steele held a series of [[Source (journalism)#Using confidential information|off the record]] meetings with journalists from ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Yahoo! News]], ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and [[CNN]].&lt;ref name="web"/&gt; In October 2016, Steele spoke about his discoveries to [[David Corn]] of the progressive American political magazine ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]''. Steele said he decided to pass his dossier to both British and American intelligence officials after concluding that the material should not just be in the hands of political opponents of Trump, but was a matter of national security for both countries.&lt;ref name="MJ31Oct"&gt;[[David Corn]]: [https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump A Veteran Spy Has Given the FBI Information Alleging a Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump], ''Mother Jones'', 31 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Corn's resulting 31 October article in ''Mother Jones'' was the first to publicly mention the dossier, although the article did not disclose Steele's identity.&lt;ref name="MJ31Oct" /&gt; The magazine did not publish the dossier itself, however, or detail its allegations, since they could not be verified.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matt Taibbi]]: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/the-russia-story-reaches-a-crisis-point-w460806 "The Russia Story Reaches a Crisis Point"], ''Rolling Stone'', 13 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-election work on the dossier===
Steele continued to work for Fusion GPS on the dossier without a client to pay him.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Confessore|first1=Scott Shane, Nicholas|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Matthew|title=How a Sensational, Unverified Dossier Became a Crisis for Donald Trump|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-intelligence.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=16 January 2017|date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the election, Steele's dossier "became one of Washington's worst-kept secrets, and journalists worked to verify the allegations.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; On 18 November 2016, [[Andrew Wood (diplomat)|Sir Andrew Wood]], British ambassador to Moscow from 1995 to 2000, met with U.S. Senator [[John McCain]] at the [[Halifax International Security Forum]] in Canada, and told McCain about the existence of the collected materials about Trump.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Jim|title=Timeline: That Russian Trump blackmail dossier has been making the rounds for months&amp;nbsp;– here is how it finally came to light|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/timeline-russia-trump-sex-blackmail-golden-shower-dossier-2017-1?r=UK&amp;IR=T|website=Business Insider|accessdate=16 January 2017|date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood vouched for Steele's professionalism and integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sengupta|first=Kim|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-russia-dossier-leak-sir-andrew-wood-john-mccain-british-ambassador-spy-a7524931.html|title=Revealed: former British ambassador Sir Andrew Wood's key role in Trump investigation|work=The Independent|date=12 January 2017|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early December, McCain obtained a copy of the dossier from [[David J.

In a second memo Steele wrote in November 2016, after the termination of his contract with Fusion, he reported that Russian officials had claimed that Russia had blocked Donald Trump from nominating [[Mitt Romney]] to be his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], due to Romney's hawkishness on Russia.&lt;ref name="Mayer_3/12/2018"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |quote=According to the report, Mr. Steele created another, previously unreleased memo in late November 2016, which said the Kremlin "intervened to block" Mr. Trump's choice of Mr. Romney for secretary of state.

===Revealed identity===
On 11 January 2017, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' revealed that Steele was the author of the dossier about Trump, citing "people familiar with the matter".&lt;ref name="WSJ_Hope_2017"/&gt; Although the dossier's existence had been "common knowledge" among journalists for months at that point and had become public knowledge during the previous week, Steele's name had not been revealed. ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' asserted that Steele's anonymity had been "fatally compromised" after [[CNN]] published his nationality.&lt;ref name="tg-terrified" /&gt;

''[[The Independent]]'' reported that Steele left his home in England several hours before his name was published as the author of the dossier, as he was fearful of retaliation by Russian authorities.&lt;ref name="tg-terrified" /&gt;  In contrast, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that he left after he had been identified earlier in the day by the initial ''Wall Street Journal'' report.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost_Dossier1_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/12/this-former-british-spy-was-identified-as-the-trump-dossier-source-now-he-is-in-hiding/ |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |title=This former British spy was identified as the Trump dossier source. Now he is in hiding. |first=Karla |last=Adam |date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher Burrows, director of Orbis Business Intelligence, Ltd., said he would not "confirm or deny" that Orbis had produced the dossier.&lt;ref name="NBC_Memo_2017"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nichols |first=Hans |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-british-spy-christopher-steele-prepared-explosive-trump-memo-n705891 |title=Former British Spy Christopher Steele Prepared Explosive Trump Memo |publisher=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steele's relationship with the FBI ended, variously associated with either the public revelation of Steele's identity, or Steele's release of information to the press, or Steele's denial to the FBI of having spoken to the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fbi-once-planned-to-pay-former-british-spy-who-authored-controversial-trump-dossier/2017/02/28/896ab470-facc-11e6-9845-576c69081518_story.html|title=FBI once planned to pay former British spy who authored controversial Trump dossier|last=Hamburger|first=Tom|date=28 February 2017|work=Washington Post|access-date=2 February 2018|last2=Helderman|first2=Rosalind S.|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/read-the-fisa-memo_us_5a731280e4b0bf6e6e2236d9|title=Read The GOP's Controversial Secret FISA Memo|last=Lavender|first=Paige|date=2 February 2018|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2 February 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source dates this event to late October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew C.

''National Review''. 10 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March 2017, as some members of the United States Congress were expressing interest in meeting with or hearing testimony from Steele, he reemerged after weeks in hiding, appearing publicly on camera and stating, "I'm really pleased to be back here working again at the Orbis's offices in London today".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/donald-trump-russia-dossier-christopher-steele-ex-spy-british-a7616326.html|title=Ex-British spy Christopher Steele breaks silence over Trump Russia dossier|date=7 March 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=11 March 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disclosure and reactions===
In early January 2017, a two-page summary of the Trump dossier was presented to President [[Barack Obama]] and President-elect Donald Trump in meetings with Director of National Intelligence [[James Clapper]], FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director [[John O. Brennan|John Brennan]], and NSA Director Admiral [[Michael S. Rogers|Mike Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;Steve Robson, Christopher Bucktin, Louise Sassoon: [https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/cia-believes-russia-more-one-9607370 "CIA 'believes Russia has more than one Donald Trump sex tape and second source claims it DOES exist'"], ''Mirror Online'', 12 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 2017, ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' was the first media outlet to publish the full 35-page dossier. In publishing the Trump dossier, BuzzFeed stated that it had been unable to verify or corroborate the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Masha Gessen]]: [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/14/opinion/sunday/lessons-from-russia-verify-everything-dont-publish-rumors.html Lessons From Russia: Verify Everything, Don't Publish Rumors], The New York Times, 14 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The UK issued a DSMA notice on 10 January 2017, requesting that the media not release Steele's identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Register on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/TheRegister/status/819281049985257472|website=Twitter|accessdate=26 January 2017|date=11 January 2017|quote=US media names ex-MI6 agent as source of the CNN/BuzzFeed dossier on Trump. UK media gets a D-Notice…}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the BBC and other UK news media released the information in news stories the same day.&lt;ref name=dsma /&gt; Trump vigorously denied the dossier's allegations, calling it [[fake news]] during a press conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jamieson|first1=Amber|title='You are fake news': Trump attacks CNN and BuzzFeed at press conference|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/11/trump-attacks-cnn-buzzfeed-at-press-conference|accessdate=7 July 2017|work=The Guardian|date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Putin]] also dismissed the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chaplain|first1=Chloe|title=Vladimir Putin: Russian prostitutes are the best in the world|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/vladimir-putin-russian-prostitutes-are-the-best-in-the-world-a3443261.html|accessdate=7 July 2017|work=Evening Standard|date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ynet]], an Israeli online news site, reported that American intelligence advised Israeli intelligence officers to be cautious about sharing information with the incoming Trump administration, until the possibility of Russian influence over Trump, suggested by Steele's report, has been fully investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Ronen Bergman: [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4906642,00.html US intel sources warn Israel against sharing secrets with Trump administration], Ynetnews News, 12. January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Former British ambassador to Russia, Sir [[Tony Brenton]], read Steele's report. Speaking on [[Sky News]] he said, "I've seen quite a lot of intelligence on Russia, and there are some things in it which look pretty shaky". Brenton expressed some doubts due to discrepancies in how the dossier described aspects of the hacking activities, as well as Steele's ability to penetrate the Kremlin and Russian security agencies, given that he is an outsider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump dossier 'shaky' – former British envoy|url=http://news.sky.com/story/trump-dossier-shaky-ex-british-envoy-to-russia-says-10726703|website=Sky News|accessdate=16 January 2017|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2017, former Acting CIA Director [[Michael Morell]] raised questions about the dossier. He was concerned about the accuracy of the information, due to the approach taken by Steele to gather it. Steele gave money to intermediaries and the intermediaries paid the sources. Morell said, "Unless you know the sources, and unless you know how a particular source acquired a particular piece of information, you can't judge the information&amp;nbsp;– you just can't". Morell continues to believe that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dilanian|first1=Ken|title=Clinton Ally Michael Morell says no evidence of Trump–Russia collusion|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/clinton-ally-says-smoke-no-fire-no-russia-trump-collusion-n734176|website=NBC News|accessdate=28 March 2017|language=en|date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Role in subsequent investigations====
In the summer of 2017, two Republican staffers for the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] travelled to London to investigate the dossier, visiting the office of Steele's lawyer but not meeting with Steele.&lt;ref name="PoliticoGOP"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/04/trump-steele-dossier-russia-241299 |publisher=''[[Politico]]'' |title=Hunt for Trump dossier author inflames Russia probe |first=Ali |last=Watkins |date=4 August 2017 |access-date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Devin Nunes]], Chair of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]], travelled to London in an attempt to meet with the heads of [[MI5]], [[MI6]], and [[GCHQ]] for information about Steele, but was rebuffed by the three agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/devin-nuness-curious-trip-to-london/568699/ |publisher=''[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]]'' |title=Devin Nunes's Curious Trip to London |first=Natasha |last=Bertrand |date=August 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828170544/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/devin-nuness-curious-trip-to-london/568699/ |archive-date=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-nunes/congressman-nunes-sought-meeting-with-uk-spy-chiefs-in-london-idUSKCN1LD1VX |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=August 28, 2018 |title=Congressman Nunes sought meeting with UK spy chiefs in London |first=Mark |last=Hosenball |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Graff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal action====
In February 2017, lawyers for Russian internet entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev filed a libel suit against Steele in London.

====Senate Republicans' referral for a criminal investigation====

On 5 January 2018, [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] Chairman [[Chuck Grassley]], joined by senior Republican member [[Lindsey Graham]], issued a criminal referral regarding Steele to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] for it to investigate whether Steele had lied to the FBI about his interactions with the media.&lt;ref name="DOJRef"&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles E. |last=Grassley |first2=Lindsey O. |last2=Graham |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205174818/https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018-02-02%20CEG%20LG%20to%20DOJ%20FBI%20(Unclassified%20Steele%20Referral).pdf |archive-date=5 February 2018 |url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018-02-02%20CEG%20LG%20to%20DOJ%20FBI%20(Unclassified%20Steele%20Referral).pdf |title=Referral of Christopher Steele for Potential Violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 |publisher=[[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] |date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/grassley-graham-refer-dossier-author-christopher-steele-for-criminal-investigation |publisher=[[Reuters]] via ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' |title=Grassley, Graham Refer Dossier Author Christopher Steele for Criminal Investigation |first=Aaron P. |last=Bernstein |quote=In a shocking move Friday afternoon, GOP Senators Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham referred the so-called "Trump dossier" writer Christopher Steele for criminal investigation.

Rather, they had passed on the information for 'further investigation only'".&lt;ref name="BBC_News_1/5/2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=Senators urge Trump dossier author probe | website=BBC News | date=5 January 2018 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42586855 | access-date=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referral was met with skepticism from legal experts, as well as members of both parties on the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; Fusion GPS lawyer Joshua A. Levy said that the referral was just another effort to discredit the investigation into Russian interference in the election and that: "After a year of investigations into Donald Trump's ties to Russia, the only person Republicans seek to accuse of wrongdoing is one who reported on these matters to law enforcement in the first place".&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; Veteran prosecutor [[Peter Zeidenberg]] called the referral "nonsense" because "the FBI doesn't need any prompting from politicians to prosecute people who have lied to them."&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; Another former federal prosecutor, Justin Dillon said that "it was too early to assume the letter was simply a political attack". The senior Democrat on the Committee, [[Diane Feinstein]], said that the referral was made without consultation of any Democrats on the committee and released a five-page rebuttal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/0/9/09710d10-8885-4c05-9dee-d587fe0b7c0d/4E7F2E9D9626E9A02A76AC28640D0A01.steele-criminal-referral-analysis.pdf |title=Analysis Refutes Criminal Referral of Christopher Steele |publisher=[[United States Senate]] |date=9 February 2018 |archive-date=9 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209191017/https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/0/9/09710d10-8885-4c05-9dee-d587fe0b7c0d/4E7F2E9D9626E9A02A76AC28640D0A01.steele-criminal-referral-analysis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Republican aide said that Grassley and Graham were "carrying water for the White House"; that their actions did not reflect the views of the committee as a whole; and that other members were upset with Grassley over the matter.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt;

In an opinion-editorial for ''Politico'', former CIA official John Sipher said that the attacks on Steele, a private citizen who provided information to the FBI that alarmed him, will make future tipsters less likely to approach American law enforcement with information that bears on national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/05/christopher-steele-dossier-smearing-216940|title=The Smearing of Christopher Steele|work=Politico|access-date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cornelia Arnolda Johanna "Corrie" ten Boom''' (15 April 1892 – 15 April 1983) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[watchmaker]] and later a writer, who worked with her father and other family members to help many Jews escape the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Holocaust]] during [[World War II]] by hiding them in her home. They were caught and she was arrested and sent to a Nazi concentration camp ([[Ravensbrück concentration camp]]). Her most famous book, ''[[The Hiding Place (biography)|The Hiding Place]]'', is a biography that recounts the story of her family's efforts and how ten Boom found hope while imprisoned at the concentration camp. 

== Early life ==

Corrie ten Boom was born on 15 April 1892 to a working class family in Amsterdam, Netherlands, near Haarlem. Named after her mother Cornelia but known as ''Corrie'' all her life, she was the youngest child of [[Casper ten Boom]], a jeweler and watchmaker.&lt;ref name="auto0"&gt;{{Citation|  url = https://www.biography.com/people/corrie-ten-boom-21358155 | publisher = A&amp;E Television Networks, LLC. | title =  Corrie ten Boom Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was fascinated by the craft of watchmaking and often became so engrossed in his own work that he forgot to charge customers for the services.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She trained to be a watchmaker herself and in 1922 became the first woman licensed as a watchmaker in The Netherlands. Over the next decade, in addition to working in her father's shop, she established a youth club for teenage girls, which provided religious instruction as well as classes in the performing arts, sewing and handicrafts.&lt;ref name="auto0"/&gt; She and her family were Calvinists in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], and their faith inspired them to serve their society, offering shelter, food, and money to those in need.&lt;ref name="auto0"/&gt;

==World War II==
In May 1940 the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Nazis invaded the Netherlands]]. Among their restrictions was banning the youth club.&lt;ref&gt;ten Boom, Corrie. The Hiding Place. Peabody Massachusetts Hendrickson Publishers, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = March 2013}} In May 1942 a well-dressed woman came to the ten Booms' with a suitcase in hand and told them that she was a Jew, her husband had been arrested several months before, her son had gone into hiding, and Occupation authorities had recently visited her, so she was afraid to go back. She had heard that the ten Booms had helped their Jewish neighbors, the Weils, and asked if they might help her too. Casper ten Boom readily agreed that she could stay with them, despite the police headquarters being only half a block away.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; A devoted reader of the Old Testament, he believed that the Jews were the "[[Jews as the chosen people|chosen people]]", and he told the woman, "In this household, God's people are always welcome."&lt;ref&gt;Boom, Corrie ten. The Hiding Place. Peabody Massachusetts Hendrickson Publishers, 2009, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The family then became very active in the [[Dutch resistance|Dutch underground]] hiding refugees; they honored the Jewish [[Shabbat|Sabbath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A622388 | publisher = The British Broadcasting Company | title = DNA | contribution = H2G2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The family never sought to convert any of the Jews who stayed with them.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the ten Booms began "The Hiding Place", or "De Schuilplaats", as it was known in Dutch (also known as "de Béjé", pronounced in Dutch as 'bayay', an abbreviation of their street address, the [[Barteljorisstraat]]). Corrie ten Boom and her sister Betsie opened their home to refugees — both Jews and others who were members of the resistance movement — being sought by the [[Gestapo]] and its Dutch counterpart. They had plenty of room, although wartime shortages meant that food was scarce. Every non-Jewish Dutch person had received a ration card, the requirement for obtaining weekly food coupons. Through her charitable work, ten Boom knew many people in Haarlem and remembered a couple who had a disabled daughter. The father was a civil servant who by then was in charge of the local ration-card office.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; She went to his house one evening, and when he asked how many ration cards she needed, "I opened my mouth to say, 'Five,'" ten Boom wrote in ''The Hiding Place''. "But the number that unexpectedly and astonishingly came out instead was: 'One hundred.'"&lt;ref&gt;Boom, Corrie ten. The Hiding Place. Peabody Massachusetts Hendrickson Publishers, 2009, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; He gave them to her and she provided cards to every Jew she met.

The refugee work done at the Beje by ten Boom and her sister became known by the Dutch Resistance. The Resistance sent an architect to the ten Boom home to build a secret room adjacent to ten Boom's room for the Jews in hiding, as well as an alert buzzer to warn the refugees to get into the room as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Arrest, detention, and release===
On February 28, 1944, a Dutch informant named Jan Vogel told the Nazis about the ten Booms' work; at around 12:30 P.M. the Nazis arrested the entire ten Boom family. They were sent to [[Scheveningen]] prison when Resistance materials and extra [[ration cards]] were found at the home.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nollie and Willem were released immediately along with Corrie's nephew Peter; Casper died 10 days later. The six people hidden by the ten Booms, among them both Jews and resistance workers, remained undiscovered: Corrie ten Boom received a letter one day in prison reading "All the watches in your cabinet are safe," meaning the refugees had managed to escape and were safe.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Four days after the raid, resistance workers transferred them to other locations. Altogether, the Gestapo arrested some 30 people in the ten Boom family home that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10006914 | publisher = The Holocaust Memorial | title = Holocaust Memorial - Corrie ten Boom }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten Boom was initially held in solitary confinement. After three months, she was taken to her first hearing. On trial, ten Boom spoke about her work with the mentally disabled; the Nazi lieutenant scoffed, as the Nazis had been killing mentally disabled individuals for years based on their eugenics ideologies.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten Boom defended her work, saying that in the eyes of God, a mentally disabled person might be more valuable "than a watchmaker. Or a lieutenant."&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

Corrie and Betsie were sent from Scheveningen to [[Herzogenbusch concentration camp|Herzogenbusch]], a political [[concentration camp]] (also known as Kamp Vught), and finally to the [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]], a women's labor camp in [[Germany]]. There they held worship services, after the hard days at work, using a Bible that they had managed to sneak in.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; While at Ravensbruck, Betsie ten Boom began to discuss plans with her sister after the war for a place of healing. Betsie's health continued to deteriorate and she died on December 16, 1944 at the age of 59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|pages=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before she died, she told Corrie, "There is no pit so deep that He [God] is not deeper still." Fifteen days later, Corrie was released. Afterwards, she was told that her release was due to a clerical error and that a week later, all the women in her age group were sent to the gas chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Boom, Corrie ten. The Hiding Place. Peabody Massachusetts Hendrickson Publishers, 2009, p 240&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrie ten Boom returned home in the midst of the "[[Dutch famine of 1944–45|hunger winter]]." She opened her doors still to the mentally disabled who were in hiding for fear of execution.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life after the war==
After the war, ten Boom returned to The Netherlands to set up a [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] center in Bloemendaal. The refugee houses housed of concentration-camp survivors and sheltered the jobless Dutch who previously collaborated with Germans during the Occupation exclusively until 1950, when it accepted anyone in need of care. She returned to Germany in 1946, and met with and forgave two Germans who had been employed at Ravensbruck, one of whom was particularly cruel to Betsie.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Ten Boom went on to travel the world as a public speaker, appearing in more than 60 countries. She wrote many books during this time.

Corrie Ten Boom told the story of her family members and their [[World War II]] work in her best-selling book, ''[[The Hiding Place (biography)|The Hiding Place]]'' (1971), which was made into a 1975 [[World Wide Pictures]] film, ''[[The Hiding Place (film)|The Hiding Place]]'', starring [[Jeannette Clift]] as Corrie and [[Julie Harris (actress)|Julie Harris]] as Betsie. In 1977, 85-year-old Corrie emigrated to [[Placentia, California]]. In 1978, she suffered two [[stroke]]s, the first rendering her unable to speak, and the second resulting in paralysis. She died on her 91st birthday, 15 April 1983, after a third stroke.

A sequel film, ''[[Return to the Hiding Place|Return to the Hiding Place (War of Resistance)]]'', was released in 2011 in the [[United Kingdom]], with its [[United States]] release in 2013, based on Hans Poley's book, which painted a wider picture of the circle of which she was a part.

'''Darryl Cherney''' (born 1956) is a musician and environmental activist. He is a member of the [[Earth First!]] environmental movement. He lives in [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]], [[California]].

Cherney has produced five albums of his own political satire, and founded Environmentally Sound Promotions and Churn It Up Records. Together with Greg King, he co-founded{{when|date=May 2015}} the movement to save what eventually became the federally protected [[Headwaters Forest Reserve]] near [[Eureka, California]]. He organized four rallies in support of [[Julia Butterfly Hill]]'s two-year [[tree sit]]. He organized the ''[[Redwood Summer]]'' campaign with [[Judi Bari]].

One of Cherney's songs, "Where Are We Gonna Work (When the Trees Are Gone?)", has been covered by [[Jello Biafra]] and [[Mojo Nixon]] on their album ''[[Prairie Home Invasion]]''.

==Political campaigns==
Cherney ran for Congress in the 1988 [[California Democratic Party|Democratic]] primary, where he met fellow activist Judi Bari.

Cherney ran for the [[Green Party presidential primaries, 2016|Green Party presidential nomination]] in 2016.  He ran a "no money in politics" campaign on social media, featuring the hashtag ''#FeelTheChern''.

==Pipe bomb and aftermath==
On May 24, 1990, Cherney was injured when a [[pipe bomb]] exploded in the car he and Judi Bari were traveling in. Bari was severely injured by the explosion. The case was investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), which accused Bari and Cherney of bombing themselves. Bari and Cherney subsequently sued the FBI and Oakland Police agents for violations of the United States Constitution. Cherney and the late Bari's estate were awarded $4.4 million for violations of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] (freedom of speech) and the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] (the right to be free from unlawful arrest and illegal search and seizure).

In 2012, Cherney told [[KHUM]] radio that he does not consider himself an "[[extremist]]," preferring the term "[[Political radicalism|radical]]."{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} In 2012, Cherney's documentary film ''[[Who Bombed Judi Bari|Who Bombed Judi Bari?]]'' was released.&lt;ref name="pressdem"&gt;[http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20120318/LIFESTYLE/120319735?p=2&amp;tc=pg  Judi Bari documentary at film festival]&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ongoing lawsuit against the FBI to prevent it from destroying evidence that could contain the bomber's DNA, and Cherney indicated in a [[Democracy Now]] interview that he believes the FBI was guilty of not only framing him and Judi but of a [[cover-up]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFwP_S8Em2U&amp;feature=relmfu Judi Bari Revisited: New Film Exposes FBI Coverup of 1990 Car Bombing (Part 1 of 2)]&lt;/ref&gt; Cherney has stated elsewhere that “I believe the bomber is findable.”&lt;ref name="pressdem"/&gt; In October 2012, Cherney announced a $50,000 reward “for information leading to the identification, arrest, prosecution and incarceration of the person or persons responsible for the attempted assassination of Judi Bari by placing a bomb under the seat of her car.”&lt;ref&gt;Tim Phillips, [http://activistdefense.wordpress.com/2012/11/03/earth-first-activist-darryl-cherney-announces-reward-for-information-related-to-attempted-assassination-of-judi-bari/ "Earth First!

The '''Darwin–Wedgwood family''' is composed of two interrelated English families, descending from prominent 18th-century doctor [[Erasmus Darwin]], and [[Josiah Wedgwood]], founder of the pottery company, [[Josiah Wedgwood and Sons]]. Its most notable member was [[Charles Darwin]], a grandson of both. The family included at least ten [[Fellow]]s of the [[Royal Society]] and several artists and poets (including the composer [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]). Presented below are brief biographical descriptions and genealogical information with links to articles on the members. The individuals are listed by year of birth and grouped into generations. The relationship to [[Francis Galton]] and his immediate ancestors is also given. Note that the data tree below does not include all descendants or even all prominent descendants.

==The first generation==

===Josiah Wedgwood===
[[Image:JosiahWedgwood.jpeg|thumb|[[Josiah Wedgwood]] (1730–1795)]]
'''[[Josiah Wedgwood]]''' (1730–1795) was a noted pottery businessman and a friend of [[Erasmus Darwin]]. During 1780, on the death of his long-time business partner [[Thomas Bentley (manufacturer)|Thomas Bentley]], Josiah asked Darwin for help in managing the business. As a result of the close association that grew up between the Wedgwood and Darwin families, one of Josiah's daughters later married Erasmus's son Robert. One of the children of that marriage, [[Charles Darwin]], also married a Wedgwood – Emma, Josiah's granddaughter. Robert's inheritance of Josiah's money enabled him to fund Charles Darwin's chosen vocation in [[natural history]] that resulted in the [[inception of Darwin's theory]] of [[evolution]]. Subsequently Emma's inheritance made the Darwins a wealthy family.

Josiah Wedgwood married Sarah Wedgwood (1734–1815), and they had seven children, including:
* [[Susannah Wedgwood]] (1765–1817) (later Darwin; see below)
* [[Josiah Wedgwood II|Josiah Wedgwood]] (1769–1843) (see below)

===Erasmus Darwin===
[[Image:Erasdarwin1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Erasmus Darwin]] (1731–1802).]]
'''[[Erasmus Darwin]]''' (1731–1802) was a physician, [[botanist]] and poet from Lichfield, whose lengthy botanical poems gave insights into medicine and [[natural history]], and described an [[evolutionism|evolutionist]] theory that anticipated both [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and his grandson Charles. He married twice, first during 1757 to Mary Howard (1740–1770), who died from [[ethanol|alcohol]]-induced [[liver failure]] aged 31. She gave birth to:

* [[Charles Darwin (1758–1778)]] (not [[Charles Robert Darwin]])
* Erasmus Darwin the Younger (1759–1799)
* Elizabeth Darwin, 1763 (survived 4 months)
* [[Robert Waring Darwin]] (see below)
* William Alvey Darwin, (1767) (survived 19 days)

He then had an [[extra-marital affair]] with a Miss Parker, producing two daughters:

* Susanna Parker (1772&amp;ndash;1856)
* Mary Parker (1774&amp;ndash;1859)

He then became smitten with Elizabeth Collier Sacheveral-Pole, who was married to Colonel Sacheveral-Pole and was the natural daughter of the [[Charles Colyear, 2nd Earl of Portmore]]. Sacheveral-Pole died soon afterwards, and Erasmus married Elizabeth and they bore an additional seven children:

* Edward Darwin, (1782–1829)
* Frances Anne Violetta Darwin, (1783–1874); married [[Samuel Tertius Galton]]; mother of [[Francis Galton]] ([[#Francis Galton|see below]])
* Emma Georgina Elizabeth Darwin (born 1784)
* Sir [[Francis Sacheverel Darwin]] (1786–1859)
* John Darwin (1787–1865)

The son of [[Erasmus Darwin]], [[Robert Darwin]] was a noted physician from [[Shrewsbury]],&lt;ref name=milner-1&gt;Milner, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; whose own income as a physician, together with astute investment of his inherited wealth, enabled him to fund his son [[Charles Darwin]]'s place on [[the Voyage of the Beagle]] and then gave him the private income needed to support Charles' chosen vocation in [[natural history]] that led to the [[inception of Darwin's theory]] of [[evolution]]. He married [[Susannah Wedgwood]], daughter of [[Josiah Wedgwood]] ([[#Josiah Wedgwood|see above]]), and they had the following children.

There were other instances of cousin marriage as well. [[Cousin marriage]] was not uncommon in Britain during the 19th century though why is debated: poorer communications, keeping wealth within the family, more opportunity of evaluating a relative of the opposite sex as a suitable marriage partner (unmarried young women of the upper and upper middle classes were closely chaperoned when meeting men outside the family during the 19th century), more security for the woman as she would not be leaving her family (though legal rights for married women increased during the century, as a rule her property became his and she had little legal recourse if he chose to abuse her).

'''Doctor Light''' is a bipartite character, comprising [[supervillain]] Arthur Light and [[superhero]] Jacob Finlay, appearing in [[Comic book|comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]].&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Wallace | first=Dan | contribution=Doctor Light I | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=104 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=New York | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His stint as Doctor Light is concurrent with that of a superheroine using the same name and nearly identical costume, [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]]. In 2009, Doctor Light was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 84th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/84.html | title=Doctor Light is number 84 | work=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2009-10-05 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509065304/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/84.html | archivedate=2009-05-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
Doctor Light first appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #12 and was created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Mike Sekowsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 105 |quote = In a tale written by Gardner Fox, with art by Mike Sekowsky, Doctor Light's first [adventure] was almost the JLA's last.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s Doctor Light was transitioned from a serious menace to a comedic villain, a transformation which culminated in the [[DC Comics Bonus Book]] appearing in ''The Flash'' #12 (May 1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenberger|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Greenberger|title=New Talent and Bonus Babies|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=73|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Criminal physicist Doctor Arthur Light captures the League with light rays after first drawing them in by capturing [[Aquaman]], then sending the League to different planets based on their weaknesses. He then orders [[Snapper Carr]] to write this down, before imprisoning him in a light field. He has not realised [[Superman]] and [[Batman]] impersonated each other, allowing Superman to escape the world he was sent to and rescue the other members. Light fools the League with three duplicates of himself that are apparently committing robberies of light-associated objects, though they are actually placing devices around the world. [[Green Lantern]] realizes this trick and fakes his death to track Doctor Light, finally stopping him before he pulls the lever that would have set off the light impulses allowing him to take over the world. A [[retcon]] introduced in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' #37 reveals that this character is actually the second Doctor Light. According to the retcon, his predecessor was his partner at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]], a scientist named Jacob Finlay. Finlay created a technologically advanced suit to control light allowing him to be a minor superhero, but was accidentally killed by Arthur Light (though Finlay's death may have been caused by hiding his costume in a computer console, causing it to malfunction). Light took the suit and the "Doctor Light" codename. He is periodically haunted by Finlay's ghost through the years, but can use the light generated by the suit to drive off this spirit.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

Through the Silver and Bronze Ages, Doctor Light is a minor but persistent foe for a number of heroes. He fights the Justice League's former sidekicks, the [[Teen Titans]]. In ''JLA'' #136, he is one of [[King Kull (DC Comics)|King Kull]]'s agents with which the Beast-Man hopes to wipe out humanity on all three Earths, helping in the attack on Earth-S by creating perpetual light and darkness on each side of the Earth, and teaming up with the [[Shade (comics)|Shade]]. He is turned to stone by King Kull's satellites, but restored when they are destroyed. He is beaten by [[Hal Jordan]] not long after his defeat by the JLA. He then founds the supervillain team the [[Fearsome Five]], but they are also defeated by the Titans, and Light is violently expelled from the Five by his teammates.&lt;ref name="dc-fear"&gt;{{Citation | last=Greenberger | first=Robert | authorlink=Robert Greenberger | contribution=Fearsome Five | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=120 | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | location=New York | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each criminal caper leads to Light's defeat, but these defeats were used later as the basis of his humiliation that culminated in the "[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]" storyline.

Dr. Light was once defeated by Little Boy Blue and his Blue Boys—a group of non-superpowered children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=Broderick, George, Jr.|penciller=[[Gordon Purcell|Purcell, Gordon]]|inker=Dzon, Timothy|story=Light at the End of the Tunnel|title= [[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]|issue=12|date=May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide Squad===
Driven by self-doubt and guilt, thanks in part to Finlay's ghostly presence, he volunteers for the [[Suicide Squad]], a group of incarcerated supervillains who perform dangerous missions for the US government in exchange for clemency. On a mission against the patriotism-themed super-team called the "[[Force of July]]", he encounters [[Sparkler (comics)|Sparkler]], the Force's youngest member. The presence of a superpowered child reminds him of past defeats and he lashes out, killing Sparkler with a blast through the chest.

During his time with the Squad, Light demonstrates a simple desire to be liked by the other members. He sees his chance when a mysterious pie-armed attacker is on the loose but after faking a hit nobody actually believes Light has been pied.

Finally, Finlay's ghost convinces Light to attempt a heroic turn during a mission where multiple members of the team, some unwillingly, have traveled to [[Apokolips]]. Light is swiftly shot dead by [[Parademon]]s. Light is sent to Hell, where he is physically reunited with Finlay. Under the watch of a lesser demon and its annoying assistant, both men are released from Hell in turns and returned to life. Both only soon die again: Arthur Light suffocates while still inside his grave, while the desiccated Finlay claws his way out of his own grave but is killed by a family of religious vigilantes. Arthur Light is again returned to life, and barely survives a fall that his demonic tormentors may have intended to be fatal. Arthur also possesses the body of the female [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]], Kimiyo Hoshi. With the aide of her teacher, Kimiyo rejects Arthur's presence. Doctor Light, freed of his ex-partner's hauntings, attempts to rejoin the Suicide Squad, but his appeal is summarily rejected by [[Amanda Waller]].

He later becomes trapped in a Green Lantern power battery which would eventually came under the possession of [[Kyle Rayner]], and as a consequence is temporarily transformed into living light. He later joins a short-lived incarnation of the [[Injustice Gang]], in which he assists [[Lex Luthor]] in building holographic duplicates of the JLA.

===Identity Crisis onwards===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Zatannalight.PNG|thumb|Zatanna [[mind-wiping]] Doctor Light. Art by [[Brian Bolland]].]] --&gt;
The 2004 miniseries ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' retroactively reveals that Doctor Light had raped [[Sue Dibny]], the wife of the superhero [[Elongated Man]], on the JLA Satellite.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt; Later issues reveal that he was a serial rapist. The Justice League resolve to alter his mind with Zatanna's magic so that Light will no longer pose a threat to their loved ones. In the process, they accidentally give him a partial lobotomy, thus explaining how he fell from a plausible foe of the Justice League to a punching bag for the Teen Titans or Little Boy Blue. He later recovers his memories and intellect when witnessing a fight between the League members responsible for his mind-wipe and [[Deathstroke]], and vowed revenge against the Justice League.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

Doctor Light captures Green Arrow, using him as bait so he could get revenge on the Teen Titans. The entire Teen Titans roster, former and current, responds to the call, but he brutally defeats them. After a mass battle against the Titans wears him down, [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] uses a device to drain the light out of the area, rendering Light powerless. Batman and [[Batgirl]] appear to take him to prison, but reveal themselves to be Deathstroke and [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]] in disguise, and offer Light a place in the new [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. Doctor Light, hungry for vengeance and power, readily accepts.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' Vol.3 #21-23&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Society member, he aids [[Merlyn (DC Comics)|Merlyn]] and Deathstroke in defeating Green Arrow in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]]. Doctor Light then attacks and absorbs a great deal of power from Kimiyo Hoshi.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Arrow'' #54&lt;/ref&gt; He later participates in the Battle of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7, where he is defeated by the combined efforts of the [[Ray (Ray Terrill)|Ray]], Black Canary, [[Martian Manhunter]], and Kimiyo.

In the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'', Light is a member of the [[Injustice League|Injustice League Unlimited]]. During a battle with the Justice League, fellow Injustice Leaguer [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] betrays him and slashes him in the back because of her hatred of rapists.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' vol. 2, #15 (December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The entire Injustice League is captured and deported to an alien world by the Suicide Squad; Doctor Light is consequently one of the villains featured in ''[[Salvation Run]]''.

After returning to Earth, in ''DC Universe'' #0, Doctor Light is a member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. In ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #1, he and [[Mirror Master]] are sent by Libra to recover [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]'s chair. They are briefly challenged by [[Empress (comics)|Empress]], [[Sparx (comics)|Sparx]], and [[Más y Menos]], but defeat them by combining Light's beams with Mirror Master's mirrors. Light also aids the [[Human Flame]] and Libra in the murder of the [[Martian Manhunter]].

In ''[[Final Crisis: Revelations]]'' #1, the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] delivers final judgment on Doctor Light (who is discovered in the middle of a mock superhero rape orgy with various women dressed as [[Teen Titans]]), and burns him to death by turning him into a candle, using his head as the wick. The [[Milestone Comics]] group known as the Shadow Cabinet attempt to steal the remains of Light, still in the form of a candle.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' vol. 2, #27 (November 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In actuality, Superman and [[Icon (comics)|Icon]] set this scenario up to familiarize the Shadow Cabinet with the JLA. The candle is, however, used by [[Hardware (comics)|Hardware]] to restore to Kimiyo Hoshi the remaining powers Arthur stole from her.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' vol. 2, #28 (December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' vol. 2, #30 (February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor Light is entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Blackest Night]]'' #1 (July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; His corpse is revived as a [[Black Lantern]].&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night'' #3 (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He devours the remains of [[Gehenna (comics)|Gehenna]]'s corpse, and attacks Kimiyo Hoshi.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' vol. 2, #39 (November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur employs psychology to make Kimiyo doubt herself. Just as he is on the verge of victory, he threatens Kimiyo's children, enraging her to the point where she produces a light which incinerates Arthur and his ring.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' vol. 2, #40 (December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
In [[The New 52]] (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Arthur Light is a scientist working with [[A.R.G.U.S.]] and the Justice League of America. As he is studying a communicator used by the Secret Society of Super Villains, he receives a "nasty call" and is engulfed in an explosion of light leaving his body glowing on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' vol. 3 #4&lt;/ref&gt; Director Amanda Waller finds him transformed.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' vol. 3 #5&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "[[Trinity War]]" storyline, Doctor Light is a reluctant member of the new Justice League of America, and expresses disgust over being made to harm [[Firestorm (comics)|Ronnie Raymond and Jason Rusch]]. During his first mission with the team, he is seemingly killed by Superman.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' vol. 2, #22 (July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Phantom Stranger]] takes Batman, [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], and [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] to the afterlife to locate Doctor Light. However, he doesn't remember anything about his death. The Phantom Stranger tells Doctor Light that he will try to free him from the afterlife, so he can be with his family. Doctor Light gives a piece of his soul to the Phantom Stranger in hopes that he can give it to his family as a final gift if he doesn't get out.&lt;ref&gt;''Trinity of Sin: Phantom Stranger'' #11&lt;/ref&gt; It is later revealed that [[Atomica]], who is from the alternate universe of [[Earth-Three#The New 52|Earth-3]], is responsible for Doctor Light's death.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' vol. 2 #23&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor Light's body unleashes energy that destroys Washington DC's A.R.G.U.S. headquarters and exposes the A.R.G.U.S. Agents to it. [[Etta Candy]] is approached by an energy manifestation of Dr. Light.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Forever Evil]]: A.R.G.U.S.'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor Light appears in Los Angeles and is found by the Crimson Men.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; The Crimson Men take Dr. Light to their secret location, and promise to make him human again in exchange for information on Steve Trevor. Dr. Light heads to Steve Trevor's location and states he must kill him in order for him to live.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; Killer Frost faces off against Doctor Light. Doctor Light hurls her into Steve's ice-block, freeing him. While Killer Frost holds Light back, Steve sneaks up behind him and wraps the Lasso of Truth around him. Compelled by its power, Doctor Light explains that he died and woke up confused. He was told what to do and where Steve would be. The Crimson Men had told him the truth that Arthur Light is dead. Horrified by his own self-realization, Doctor Light disappears in a blast of light energy.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor Light later resurfaces, now sporting his classic appearance. He states that his human body is still dead, and that he now merely exists as a construct of living light energy. It is also implied that he used to be a villain prior to his brief stint as a member of the Justice League, indicating his backstory has been retconned to some degree. Having been cut off from his wife and daughters, Arthur has fled to the country of Chetland, where he is given asylum in exchange for his services. After a conversation with Deathstroke, Arthur contemplates the possibility of returning to a life of villainy.&lt;ref&gt;''Deathstroke'' (vol. 4) #22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Doctor Light can control light for a variety of purposes. He can bend the light around him to become invisible, generate blasts of energy, create force fields, and fly. By mentally repulsing photons, Light can create areas of complete darkness. ''Teen Titans'' #23 implied that Light could "power up" by draining the ambient light in the area.

The limits of his powers are unclear, but he seems to be able to wrest control of anything that emits light.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt; Such things have included [[Green Lantern]] constructs, [[Superboy]]'s heat vision, and magic lightning from [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl's]] lasso. He is also able to take the "internal" light away from light powered characters, the heroic [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]] and the [[Ray (Ray Terrill)|Ray]], leaving them temporarily powerless. He also has the ability to create holographic images. Despite his frequent defeats, he is quite powerful.

Originally, Doctor Light derives his powers from his suit, but over time he internalizes this ability, and could use his powers without having to use his costume.

Arthur Light is mentally brilliant, a genius in the field of physics. However, his mindwipe by the Justice League reduces his intelligence substantially, along with his skills for creative use of his powers. Light's recovery of his memories seems to have brought his intellect back with them and also his paraphilia.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt; As a result, he becomes a much deadlier opponent.

==In other media==
===Animation===
[[File:Dr.light.jpg|thumb|right|Doctor Light's first armor.]]
* Doctor Light is a fairly minor villain in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Rodger Bumpass]]. His character mostly draws from the less-competent version in the comics, though he does prove to be a formidable opponent. His powers are derived from his suit. Light is generally portrayed as more of a nuisance than a real threat, though he has his moments, and his frequent short appearances and easily defeats are something of a [[running gag]]. Doctor Light first appears in the season one episode "Nevermore", where he proves to be a fairly dangerous opponent. He wears a simple, form-fitting suit which can fire energy blasts and create shields. Though he succeeds in defeating four of the five Titans, he angers [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] while attacking her. In her rage, she loses control of her powers and drags him into the darkness within her cloak. His second major appearance is in "Birthmark". His suit is larger and more powerful, adding a light whip to his arsenal; he appears on an oil rig which he plans to steal the energy from, but was stopped by the Teen Titans who pointed out that they could see him on the rig from the living room of their tower. His fear of Raven prevented a drawn-out battle, with him asking to be taken to prison rather than having to fight her again. In the fifth season Doctor Light is one of the few villains that does not join the Brotherhood of Evil. In "Kole", he tries to harness the power of the [[Aurora Borealis]] with a special crystal, only to fail when the Titans intervene and destroy it. Both he and the Titans fall through the ice into an underground prehistoric land. There, he kidnaps [[Kole]] to replace his broken crystal, which makes him virtually unstoppable. [[Gnarrk]] removes Kole from the machine, allowing Kole to defeat Doctor Light by focusing Starfire's starbolts into a powerful laser. In "Titans Together", he attempts to rob a bank while the heroes and villains were occupied. All thirty Titans, having dispatched the Brotherhood, ready themselves to take him down, to which Raven remarks, "He's ''totally'' gonna freak this time".

[[File:Doctor Light.PNG|thumb|right|Doctor Light as he appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'']]
* Doctor Light appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'', voiced by [[Scott Menville]] in "Colors of Raven" and reprised by [[Rodger Bumpass]] in "Caged Tiger". In "Staff Meeting", Robin tries to fight Doctor Light with his bent bo staff (which was bent by the other Teen Titans). Doctor Light's most major role in the series is in the episode "Caged Tiger" where Raven and [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]] come to battle him while Robin, [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and [[Beast Boy]] are stuck in an elevator. Doctor Light insists that they wait for the other Titans to arrive as he had specifically built a machine to destroy all the Titans at once. While the boys try to get out of the elevator, Raven and Starfire enjoy their time with Doctor Light as he tells them about how he got the nickname "Doctor Light" and how his real name is Arthur. He eventually decides to quit being a supervillain and join the Teen Titans but Robin, Cyborg, and Beast Boy arrive at the scene and beat him up much to Starfire and Raven's disapproval. In "I See You", Doctor Light was shown to be constructing chandeliers which are actually laser weapons. Doctor Light's plot was defeated by Robin and Starfire during their stakeout.

===Live action===
* Doctor Light appeared in the ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' episode "The Eyes Have It", played by [[David Bowe (actor)|David Bowe]]. He was a scientist named Doctor '''Arthur Leit''' who had stolen an ultraviolet light beam from Doctor Neal Faraday that blinded Superman.
* The Jacob Finlay version of the character appears in ''[[Smallville]]'' season seven episodes "Blue" and "Fracture", (this version is not a [[Metahuman]]), played by [[Corey Sevier]]. Jacobey was an ex-convict bus boy who kidnapped [[Kara Zor-El]] when she lost her memory in Detroit. When [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Lois Lane]] went to rescue Kara, Finley shot and nearly killed Lex. After [[Clark Kent]] saw Lex's memories and learned of Kara's location, he went there and incapacitated Finley, at which point the police arrived. It is presumed that he was arrested for not only kidnapping, but also attempted murder.
* Arthur Light is mentioned in the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' episode "The Man Under the Hood". [[Killer Frost|Caitlin Snow]] and [[Vibe (comics)|Cisco Ramon]] find a light-based weapon designed by him and use it to halt [[Deathstroke]], explaining that Light is a former employee of [[S.T.A.R. Labs]], fired two years prior "because he was a psycho".

===Film===
* Doctor Light has a cameo appearance in the animated film ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]''. He is seen during the famous speech by [[John F. Kennedy]].
* Doctor Light makes a brief cameo appearance in the opening scene of ''[[Superman vs. The Elite]]''. A news report states that he had gone on a killing spree after escaping from the prison he was being held in, outraging a number of citizens.
* Doctor Light makes a silent cameo appearance in the ''Teen Titans Go!'' theatrical film ''[[Teen Titans Go! To the Movies]]''. In the film, as many villains including Control Freak, Doctor Light appears strapped to a light signal which forms Robin's name in the sky during Robin's musical number "My Superhero Movie".

===Video games===
* Doctor Light is an unlockable character in the "Master of Games" mode in the ''[[Teen Titans (console game)|Teen Titans]]'' console game.
* Doctor Light is an NPC in the ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' video game, as part of the 2013 [[downloadable content]] "Sons of Trigon".
* Doctor Light appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with [[Rodger Bumpass]] reprising his voice role.

===Miscellaneous===
Doctor Light appeared in the comic book tie-in ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' in issue #30, wherein he tried to steal [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg's]] battery to power his new Light Suit. He also appeared in issue #43, forming the Fearsome Five with Psimon, recruiting Gizmo, Mammoth, and Jinx (going undercover for the Titans). In the attack on Titans Tower, he ultimately surrenders when Raven scares him, going into Robin's arms begging him to make "the scary girl go away".

'''Dominic Ongwen''' was born in 1975 in the village of Coorom, Kilak County, Amuru district, Northern [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name="icc-cpi.int"/&gt; He is the ex-commander of the Sinia Brigade of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA), a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla group]] that formerly operated in northern [[Uganda]]. As the head of one of the four LRA brigades, Ongwen was a member of the "Control Altar" of the LRA that directs military strategy. He is currently detained by the [[International Criminal Court|International Criminal Court (ICC)]] and has been awaiting trial.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-30976818|title=LRA commander Dominic Ongwen appears before ICC in The Hague|date=26 January 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proceedings commenced 6 December 2016.&lt;ref name="icc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int//Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1262|title=Ongwen trial opens at International Criminal Court|date=6 December 2016|publisher=|via=www.icc-cpi.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Dominic Ongwen is almost certainly not his birth name. Like most other children of his age in [[Acholi people|Acoliland]] at the time, his parents would have trained him to give a false name if ever he was abducted, to protect the rest of the family.&lt;ref name="justiceandreconciliation.com"&gt;http://justiceandreconciliation.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/JRP_FN7_Dominic-Ongwen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abduction==
Ongwen was abducted by the LRA as he walked to Koro Abili Primary School. According to his own testimony this happened in 1988 when he was fourteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warscapes.com/opinion/dominic-ongwen-and-search-justice|title=Dominic Ongwen and the Search for Justice|date=2 March 2016|publisher=warscapes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has often been reported that he was nine or ten, and also that he was carried by other captives all the way up to the LRA’s main military bases because he was ‘too little to walk’.&lt;ref name="justiceandreconciliation.com"/&gt;

Once abducted, he was tortured and forced to watch violent rituals of people being killed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/mar/27/dominic-ongwen-war-crimes-trial-former-child-soldier-icc-uganda|title=Child soldier to war criminal: the trial of Dominic Ongwen|first=Jason|last=Burke|date=27 March 2016|publisher=|via=''[[The Guardian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently indoctrinated, while still a child, as an LRA fighter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/01/12/the-complex-story-of-a-child-soldier/ "The complex story of a child soldier," by Ledio Cakaj], [[Washington Post]], 12 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He then rose within the ranks and eventually became head of one of the four LRA brigades.

==Charges==
Ongwen was the lowest ranking of the five LRA leaders for whom the ICC issued their first ever warrants in June 2005. He is the only one who the court succeeded in detaining, and, with the exception of the leader, [[Joseph Kony]], is the only one now left alive. He was initially charged with four counts of [[war crime]]s (murder, cruel treatment of civilians, intentionally directing an attack against a civilian population and pillaging) and three counts of [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]] (murder, enslavement, and inhumane acts of inflicting serious bodily injury and suffering). The crimes were allegedly committed on or about 20 May 2004 at the Lukodi IDP Camp in the Gulu District, Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-02-04-01-05-57_English.pdf Arrest Warrant for Dominic Ongwen (public and redacted PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916071353/http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-02-04-01-05-57_English.pdf |date=September 16, 2006 }}, [[International Criminal Court]], 8 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://4genderjustice.org/statement-on-dominic-ongwens-initial-appearance-before-the-icc/|title=Statement on Dominic Ongwen's initial appearance before the ICC - Women’s Initiatives for Gender Justice|date=26 January 2015|publisher=4genderjustice.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges all relate to an attack on a camp for internally displaced people in Uganda in 2004.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

On 21 December 2015, the ICC charged Dominic Ongwen with crimes in addition to those set out in the warrant of arrest: a total of seventy counts. The additional charges related to attacks on the Pajule IDP camp, the Odek IDP camp and the Abok IDP camp. The counts brought against the suspect in the context of these attacks include attacks against the civilian population, murder, attempted murder, torture, cruel treatment, other inhumane acts, enslavement, outrages upon personal dignity, pillaging, destruction of property, and persecution. The expanded charges against Dominic Ongwen also include sexual and gender-based crimes committed from 2002 to 2005 in Sinia Brigade – forced marriage, rape, torture, sexual slavery, and enslavement – and the conscription and use of children under the age of 15 to participate actively in hostilities from 2002 to 2005, in Sinia Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/uganda/ongwen/pages/alleged-crimes.aspx|title=The Prosecutor v. Dominic Ongwen|publisher=icc-cpi.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charges are based on evidence which included witness statements or transcripts of interviews of a total of 123 witnesses, records of intercepted LRA radio communications, and oral testimonies of seven witnesses in September and November 2015.&lt;ref name="icc-cpi.int1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/pages/item.aspx?name=PR1202|title=item|publisher=icc-cpi.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Report of death==
Ongwen was reported killed in combat with a unit of the [[Uganda People's Defence Force]] on 10 October 2005,  and the identity of the body was confirmed by former LRA commanders.&lt;ref name=dead&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-02-04-01-05-43_English.pdf Submission of Information Regarding Dominic Ongwen (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024180611/http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-02-04-01-05-43_English.pdf |date=October 24, 2006 }}, ICC, 5 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, in July 2006, the ICC reported that [[genetic fingerprinting]] of the body confirmed that it was not Ongwen's. News reports of the time put Ongwen in southwest [[Equatoria]], [[Southern Sudan]], attempting to rejoin LRA head Joseph Kony in [[Garamba National Park|Garamba]], [[Ituri Province]], northeastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Ongwen and a former wife featured in a film ''Picking up the Pieces'' by [[IRIN]] and released in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=74572 Picking up the Pieces] [[IRIN]] documentary, October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uganda People's Defence Force]] spokesperson Maj. Felix Kulayije commented, "Unfortunately, the bastard is still alive."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/press/pressreleases/165.html ICC Unseals Results of Dominic Ongwen DNA Tests] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711062633/http://www.icc-cpi.int/press/pressreleases/165.html |date=July 11, 2006 }}, ICC Press release, 7 July 2006 and [http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/508695 ‘Dead’ LRA chief alive] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718122000/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/508695 |date=July 18, 2006 }}, [[New Vision]], 10 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture and arrest==
At the end of 2014, Ongwen escaped detention by Joseph Kony for having disobeyed Kony's orders and having refused to answer Kony's radio messages. Having escaped the camp near Songo, in Kafia Kingi, Ongwen came across nomadic cattle herders who took him to a [[Seleka]] rebel group near Sam Ouandja in CAR. The former Seleka group commander reached out to a merchant in Mboki, who in turn called an NGO worker in Obo. The latter reached out to the American Special Forces in Obo, CAR. An American helicopter dispatched to Sam Ouandja picked up Ongwen and brought him to Obo. The Seleka were initially unaware of Ongwen's identity but learned about it after the case became public in the media. The Seleka commander told the RFI he hoped to receive the promised reward of $5m.&lt;ref name="Libé"&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/monde/2015/01/14/fin-de-cavale-pour-le-chef-de-guerre-ougandais-dominic-ongwen_1180328 «Fin de cavale pour le chef de guerre ougandais Dominic Ongwen»] sur ''Libération''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the reward was never paid, and the Americans never publicly acknowledged the [[Seleka]] rebels' role in the capture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-30743647 «LRA's Dominic Ongwen 'capture': Seleka rebels want $5m reward»] sur le site de la BBC&lt;/ref&gt; Ongwen was then transferred successively to the [[Uganda]]n forces,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-30810501 LRA commander Dominic Ongwen 'in Ugandan custody'] [[BBC]] News, Africa, Retrieved 14 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Central African Republic]] forces, and ultimately to the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.co.ke/news/africa/LRA-Dominic-Ongwen-Uganda-Capture-ICC/-/1066/2587956/-/13bt2aj/-/index.html "Ugandan LRA rebel commander Dominic Ongwen to be tried at ICC: army,"] [[Daily Nation]], 13 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time between his arrest and his transfer to the ICC Ongwen participated in several media activities including a radio broadcast, meetings with journalists and a video recording in which he claimed that he had given himself up because he was "wasting his time in the bush" as "the LRA has no future". He urged other insurgents to resume their civilian lives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDiCGf3xDWI Dominic Ongwen reveals why he left Joseph Kony] retrieved 6 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/663641-ongwen-urges-lra-comrades-to-surrender.html Ongwen urges LRA comrades to surrender [[New Vision]]], 13 January 2015, retrieved 6 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/3673920/dominic-ongwen-lra-commander-surrender/ Surrendered LRA Commander Dominic Ongwen Says He Didn’t Want to Die in Bush] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129061650/http://time.com/3673920/dominic-ongwen-lra-commander-surrender/ |date=2015-01-29 }} [[TIME]], 19 January 2015, retrieved 6 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
On 26 January 2015, Ongwen made his first appearance before the ICC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccwomen.org/documents/Dominic-Ongwen-First-Appearance-26-January-2015.pdf First Ugandan suspect, LRA Commander Dominic Ongwen, appears before the ICC] [[Women's initiatives for gender justice]] 6 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but the commencement of the confirmation of charges hearing was postponed in order to allow the Prosecutor to prepare adequately for the hearing and to comply with the Chamber's instructions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx Ongwen case: Confirmation of charges hearing postponed to 21 January 2016] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821060843/http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx |date=21 August 2015 }} [[International Criminal Court|ICC]] 6 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 February 2015, ICC severed the proceedings against Dominic Ongwen from the case of ''The Prosecutor v. Joseph Kony, Vincent Otti, Okot Odhiambo and Dominic Ongwen''. As the three other suspects in the case have not appeared or have not been apprehended yet, the Chamber deemed it necessary to separate the case so as not to delay the pre-trial proceedings against Mr Ongwen.&lt;ref name="icc-cpi.int"/&gt;

On 26 January 2016, Ongwen appeared before the ICC for a pre-trial hearing.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

On 23 March 2016, the ICC confirmed the 70 charges brought against Dominic Ongwen and committed him to trial.&lt;ref name="icc-cpi.int1"/&gt;

The trial began on 6 December 2016, but to hear only opening statements.&lt;ref name="icc-cpi.int2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/uganda/ongwen|title=Ongwen case|publisher=icc-cpi.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongwen denied all the charges against him.&lt;ref name="icc-cpi.int2"/&gt; The Prosecution began presenting its case in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int//Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1216|title=item|publisher=icc-cpi.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2026 victims have been granted the right to participate in the proceedings.&lt;ref name="icc-cpi.int"/&gt;

Ongwen's case is unique because he himself was abducted by the LRA and forced to be a child soldier before rising to leadership. So this is the first ICC case in which an inductee is being charged with the same crimes as those done to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enoughproject.org/blogs/dominic-ongwen-trial|title=The Dominic Ongwen Trial - Enough Project|publisher=enoughproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3256">'''Donald J. Hughes''' (April 2, 1915 – April 12, 1960) was an [[United States|American]] [[nuclear physicist]], chiefly notable as one of the signers of the [[Franck Report]] in June, 1945, recommending that the United States not use the [[atomic bomb]] as a weapon to prompt the [[surrender of Japan]] in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=fr&gt;James Franck, et al. [https://fas.org/sgp/eprint/franck.html The "Franck Report": A Report to the Secretary of War], June 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the war Hughes worked at the [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=Palevsky&gt;{{cite book|last=Palevsky|first=Mary |title=Atomic fragments: a daughter's questions|publisher=University of California Press|year=2000|pages=15–16|isbn=0-520-22055-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1WLHMrI10zgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 1945, the U.S. was deciding whether to use an atomic bomb against Japan, and a very few nuclear scientists knew about the weapon's potential. Some, including Hughes, were wary, and wanted to urge the [[President of the United States]] to choose a different option. [[Arthur Compton]] appointed a committee to meet in secret, in all-night sessions in a highly secure environment.&lt;ref name="Wittner"/&gt; This committee included Hughes, and was chaired by [[James Franck]]. The final report, largely written by committee-member [[Eugene Rabinowitch]],&lt;ref name="Wittner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wittner|first=Lawrence S. |title=The Struggle Against the Bomb: One World or None: A History of the World Nuclear Disarmament Movement Through 1953|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1993|series=Stanford Nuclear Age Series|pages=25|isbn=0-8047-2141-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOFCnXvan6gC}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended that the [[nuclear bomb]] not be used, and proposed that either a demonstration of the "new weapon" be made before the eyes of representatives of all of the [[United Nations]], on a [[desert island|barren island]] or [[desert]], or to try to keep the existence of the nuclear bomb secret for as long as possible.&lt;ref name=fr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebulletin.metapress.com/content/c44g1634464675j7/?p=b09a34e5df624f6ba81f091a260ea38f&amp;pi=9 ''Minority Report''] by Josh  Schollmeyer, [http://www.thebulletin.org "Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists"], January/February 2005  (vol. 61, no. 1), pp. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; The advice of the "Franck Report" was not followed, however, and the U.S. dropped nuclear weapons [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].

After the war Hughes went to [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] and formed a group of physicists working on contemporary problems in nuclear science.&lt;ref name=Palevsky/&gt; His work centered on the [[neutron]].  Many of his publications were translated into Russian; more copies of his work were printed in the USSR than in the USA. He also spent one year at Oxford teaching.

He wrote a popular science book, ''The Neutron Story'', published 1959.

Hughes died suddenly in 1960.&lt;ref name=Palevsky/&gt;

'''Duncan F. Kenner''' (born '''Duncan Farrar Kenner'''; February 11, 1813 – July 3, 1887) was an American politician who served as a Deputy from [[Louisiana]] to the [[Provisional Congress of the Confederate States]] from 1861 to 1862. In 1864, he served as the chief diplomat from the [[Confederate States of America]] to Europe.

==Biography==
Douglas Farrar Kenner was born on February 11, 1813, in [[New Orleans]]. His ancestors were from [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/07/04/100920311.pdf|title=An Old Confederate Dead.: The Political Career of Duncan F. Kenner|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 4, 1887}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenner was married to the former Anne Guillelmine Nanine Bringier (August 24, 1822 – November 6, 1911). They resided at the [[Ashland Plantation]]. Kenner was the owner of sugar plantations in Louisiana. He used scientific techniques and was said to be the first man in Louisiana to use a railroad to bring [[sugar cane]] from the fields to the mill. He served as the President of the Louisiana Sugar Planters Association.&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt; He started his political career by working for [[John Slidell]].&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt; He served for several terms in the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] and was a member of the state constitutional conventions of 1845 and 1852, having presided over the latter conclave.

During the [[American Civil War]] of 1861-1865, he was a member of the [[Confederate Congress]] and chairman of its Ways and Means Committee.&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt; In 1862, he proposed a national income tax of 20%, including a schedule of exemptions. His tax bill went nowhere; but in April 1863, the Confederate Congress passed another act calling for a tax "in kind," payable with goods and agricultural produce rather than money, and based not on property but on agricultural produce and income it generated. In July 1862, while visiting with his family at [[Ashland Plantation]] during a recess of the legislature, Kenner narrowly avoided capture by the [[Union Army]], making his escape after being warned by one of his slaves of the advance of [[Union Army|Union]] troops. By this time he had become convinced that the emancipation of slaves was the only way to gain independence for the Confederacy. In 1864, he was sent by [[Jefferson Davis]] as special commissioner to England and France to secure the recognition of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]].&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt; Davis, through Kenner, offered the [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] of the Confederate [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] in exchange for [[diplomatic recognition]] of the Confederacy by Britain and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Donald |first=David Herbert |authorlink=David Herbert Donald |year=1995 |title=Lincoln |chapter= Chapter Twenty: With Charity for All |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |page=547 |isbn=0-684-80846-3 |oclc=35914369 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[capture of New Orleans]] in 1862, much of his property was confiscated and his slaves were freed.

After the war, he regained his wealth. Kenner was fond of horses and owned one of the largest [[Livestock|stock]] farms in the United States. In 1877 Kenner created the Louisiana Sugar Producer's Association, representing the largest planters in the state. He served as the president of the [[World Cotton Centennial]]. He also served on the Boards of Directors of several banks.&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt; Ten years later, a few months after his death, the [[Thibodaux massacre|Thibodaux Massacre]] was carried out by Democratic paramilitaries and concerned citizens in response to 10,000 sugar cane workers, 90% black, striking for three weeks, having been reverted almost to unpaid slave status. Kenner died on July 3, 1887.&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt; He was buried in a tomb in the Ascension of our Lord Catholic Church Cemetery in  [[Donaldsonville]], [[Ascension Parish]], Louisiana.

'''Edward Lewis Brown''' (born 1942) and his wife, '''Elaine Alice Brown''' (born c. 1940), residents of the state of [[New Hampshire]], gained national [[news media]] attention as tax protesters in early 2007 for refusing to pay the [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. federal income tax]] and subsequently refusing to surrender to [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] agents after having been convicted of tax crimes.&lt;ref name="ap1"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/18/AR2007011801138.html |date=2007-01-18 | publisher=''[[Associated Press]]'' | title=Man Holed Up in Home After Tax Verdict}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the conviction and sentencing, a long, armed standoff with federal law enforcement authorities at their New Hampshire residence ended with the arrest of Edward and Elaine Brown on October 4, 2007.&lt;ref name="wcax.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=7172194&amp;nav=4QcS |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120215655/http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=7172194&amp;nav=4QcS |archivedate=2008-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21142564/|title=Tax evaders caught by cops posing as fans - US news - Crime &amp; courts - NBC News|work=msnbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/10/05/tax.standoff/index.html|title=Feds tricked holed-up tax evaders|work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, while serving their sentences for the tax crimes, the Browns were found guilty by a federal district court jury of additional criminal charges arising from their conduct during the standoff.

==Ed Brown==

Ed Brown is retired from the [[pest control]] business.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

===Earlier felony convictions and pardon===
In 1960, Ed Brown was found guilty of assault with a dangerous weapon and [[armed robbery]] in connection with an attack on a man in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name = Dukakis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Dukakis+granted+pardon+to+Brown&amp;articleId=17623949-78af-47a6-961c-5ec9ae6dd813|title=Marathon bombing victims with New Hampshire ties consider jury's decision 'just'    0|work=unionleader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown was imprisoned at the Massachusetts Correctional Institute in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], was paroled in January 1965, and was pardoned in July 1976 by then-governor [[Michael Dukakis]], with the recommendation of the Massachusetts Advisory Board of Parole.&lt;ref name = Dukakis/&gt;

===Involvement in militia movement===
According to an October 1994 article in the ''[[New Hampshire Sunday News]]'',&lt;ref name=NHBase&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unionleader.com/pda-article.aspx?articleId=fc655466-78cc-455d-8997-9722d450aee1 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235610/http://www.unionleader.com/pda-article.aspx?articleId=fc655466-78cc-455d-8997-9722d450aee1 |archive-date=2007-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Brown was the spokesman for an organization called the Constitution Defense Militia and had become involved in the militia movement in late 1993. The newspaper reported that Brown designated various individuals and organizations as being part of a [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] to deprive Americans of life and liberty. Among the people and organizations named by Brown were then-U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], former President [[George H.W. Bush]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], The [[Council on Foreign Relations]], the [[United Nations]], the [[Trilateral Commission]], the [[American Bar Association]], and the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA).&lt;ref name = NHBase/&gt;

Brown reportedly had stockpiled 18 months' worth of food, with weapons and ammunition, and believed that there would be a Federal government takeover of "private property, utilities, health facilities and the media." The 1994 article reported that Brown believed the militia was setting up its own "courts… for the purpose of taking back America."&lt;ref name = NHBase/&gt; The newspaper reported that Brown said he saw no way the conflict would end except in violence.&lt;ref name = NHBase/&gt; The paper stated: "Brown, who says he is an [[agnostic]], admits it's easy to dismiss him as a nut."&lt;ref name = NHBase/&gt;

==Tax-related indictment, trial and convictions==

In April 2006, Edward and Elaine Brown were indicted in the United States District Court in New Hampshire for numerous federal tax violations.

Prosecutors in the Browns' case presented evidence that the Browns had not paid income tax since 1996 and had not filed income tax returns since 1998; they were liable for taxes of more than $625,000.&lt;ref name="ap1"/&gt;

The Browns initially chose to represent themselves, without the help of a court-appointed [[Attorney at law (United States)|lawyer]]. Halfway through the trial Ed Brown decided not to return to the court,&lt;ref name="ap1"/&gt; while Elaine Brown chose to enlist the help of a court-appointed lawyer to defend her and negotiate any possible plea bargain offered by the federal prosecutor.

The Browns claimed they had not been presented with any [[law]] that required them to pay income taxes to the federal government, an argument similar to many [[tax protester statutory arguments]].&lt;ref name="ap1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In this regard, see {{usc|26|1}}, {{usc|26|61}}, {{usc|26|63}}, {{usc|26|6011}}, {{usc|26|6012}}, {{usc|26|6151}}, {{usc|26|6651}}, and {{usc|26|7203}} and [[Tax protester statutory arguments#The .22IRS refuses to say what law makes U.S. citizens liable for income tax.22 argument|Tax protester statutory arguments]]. See also page 80 of the 2006 Instructions for Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,245003,00.html|title=Tax Fugitive Barricaded in House: 'Show Us the Law, and We'll Pay'|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2007, Edward Brown was found guilty by a [[jury]] in a Federal District Court in [[Concord, New Hampshire]] of one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States under {{usc|18|371}}, one count of conspiracy to structure financial transactions to evade the Treasury reporting requirements in violation of {{usc|18|371}}, {{usc|31|5325}} and {{usc|31|5324(a)(3)}}, and one count of structuring financial transactions to evade the Treasury reporting requirements and aiding and abetting under {{usc|31|5324(a)(3)}} and {{usc|18|2}}. Elaine Brown was convicted of one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States under {{usc|18|371}}, five counts of [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]] and aiding and abetting under {{usc|26|7201}} and {{usc|18|2}}, eight counts of willful failure to collect employment taxes under {{usc|26|7202}} and aiding and abetting under {{usc|18|2}}, one count of conspiracy to structure financial transactions to evade the Treasury reporting requirements in violation of {{usc|18|371}}, {{usc|31|5325}} and {{usc|31|5324(a)(3)}}, and two counts of structuring financial transactions to evade the Treasury reporting requirements and aiding and abetting under {{usc|31|5324(a)(3)}} and {{usc|18|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;See Jury Verdict, docket entry 133, Jan. 18, 2007, ‘’United States of America v. Elaine A. Brown and Edward Lewis Brown, Defendants’’; case no. 1:06-cr-00071-SM-ALL, [[United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire]] (Concord); and compare to Indictment, docket entry 1, April 4, 2006, ‘’United States of America v. Elaine A. Brown and Edward Lewis Brown, Defendants’’; case no. 1:06-cr-00071-SM-ALL, United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire (Concord).&lt;/ref&gt; The tax evasion convictions of Mrs. Brown involved the failure to report income of $1,310,706 over a period of five years.&lt;ref&gt;See Indictment, docket entry 1, April 4, 2006, ‘’United States of America v. Elaine A. Brown and Edward Lewis Brown, Defendants’’; case no. 1:06-cr-00071-SM-ALL, United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire (Concord).&lt;/ref&gt; Each was sentenced to over five years in prison.

Before granting Elaine Brown's release on bail, the judge of the Browns' trial ordered her not to return to the Browns' home before sentencing. As a condition of her bail agreement with the state, she was ordered to live at her son's home in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], where she had been living prior to the trial.&lt;ref name="ap1"/&gt; A tracking device was attached to her, and she was given permission to leave her son's home only if he was accompanying her; she later violated the terms of her release by destroying this device and rejoining her husband.&lt;ref name = "concord_five_years"/&gt;

On April 14, 2007, the ''[[Concord Monitor]]'' reported that Ed and Elaine Brown "recently ordered the clerk of the court to close their case, citing themselves as 'the court' and 'judge'." The Browns reportedly signed their filings with the court using new names: "Edward, a Living Soul in the Body of the Lord, of the House of Israel," and "Elaine, a Living Soul in the Body of the Lord, of the House of Israel." The court rejected the filings, ruling them [[Frivolous litigation|frivolous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/one-judge-enough-in-brown-case?CSAuthResp=1341668383:ubn17r1l9u2me228e8dk8rdfm1:CSUserId%7cCSGroupId:approved:3E8250549545EB0E4EF91E42A6F03D0F&amp;CSUserId=94&amp;CSGroupId=1 |title=PLAINFIELD: One judge enough in Brown case - Concord Monitor |work=Concord Monitor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204342/http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/one-judge-enough-in-brown-case?CSAuthResp=1341668383%3Aubn17r1l9u2me228e8dk8rdfm1%3ACSUserId%7CCSGroupId%3Aapproved%3A3E8250549545EB0E4EF91E42A6F03D0F&amp;CSUserId=94&amp;CSGroupId=1 |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Browns' residence==
&lt;!-- [[File:brownhouse.jpg||frame|right|The Browns' home]] --&gt;
Ed Brown said that he had a stock of food and supplies and that his home could run on [[Wind power|wind]] and [[solar energy|solar]] generators even if cut off from the main grid.&lt;ref name="unionleader1"/&gt;  He also stated publicly that he did not intend to go to jail and "vowed to resist arrest violently and die rather than go to prison."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/10/06/marshals_ploy_ended_standoff_peacefully/|title=Marshals pretended to be supporters to lure N.H. couple - The Boston Globe|work=boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the standoff, a number of supporters were camped outside his home and were encouraged to record any attempt to take Brown from his house. This policy of opening the door to supporters led to the successful arrest of the couple by United States Deputy Marshals who disguised themselves as supporters.

The 100 acre property at 401 Center of Town Road, [[Plainfield, New Hampshire]] was scheduled to be auctioned off in Concord, New Hampshire, on August 15, 2014 by U.S. Marshals, although no one bid at the auction. The Browns implied in interviews that the woods around the house had explosive "booby-traps. Federal officials therefore would not let interested bidders tour the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/11/29/pricey-possibly-bomb-laden-property-no-easy-sell-in-new-hampshire/|title=Pricey, possibly bomb-laden property no easy sell in New Hampshire|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, however, would-be buyers were allowed to visit the property with an Internal Revenue Service official, and the property sold for $205,000 at auction on October 22, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Sold: 100 wooded acres in New Hampshire, possibly booby-trapped|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/22/us-new-hampshire-standoff-idUSKCN0SG16020151022|newspaper = Reuters|date = 2015-10-22|access-date = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs about religion, Zionism, Judaism, Freemasonry and taxes==
The ''[[Concord Monitor]]'' wrote: "The Browns changed their names in late March [2007] after converting to a non denominational form of [[Christianity]] they learned from a man named Sonny. According to friends of the Browns, Sonny, who wears a long beard, all-white attire and sandals, flew from [[Hawaii]] to New Hampshire to visit the Browns and shared his religious and legal teachings over several days."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; Elaine Brown was quoted as saying: "The only law book we now recognize is the Bible. The only way we're coming out of our home is either as free man and free woman or in body bags."&lt;ref name="unionleader1"/&gt;

The Browns alleged that they were not United States citizens, that they were non-residents of the United States for tax purposes, that the New Hampshire business tax laws were incorrect, null and void, and that labor could not be taxed.&lt;ref&gt;Indictment, docket entry 1, April 4, 2006, ''United States of America v. Elaine A. Brown and Edward Lewis Brown, Defendants''; case no. 1:06-cr-00071-SM-ALL, United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire (Concord).&lt;/ref&gt; According to a New Hampshire newspaper, the Browns had not paid some state taxes, and "face a state tax lien for business profit taxes" of $343,000. The paper reported that with penalties and accumulated interest, the combined Federal and state tax amount owed by Edward and Elaine Brown was over three million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070621/REPOSITORY/706210340/1043/NEWS01 |title=NH news, sports, opinion &amp; photos - Concord Monitor |work=concordmonitor.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125434/http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070621%2FREPOSITORY%2F706210340%2F1043%2FNEWS01 |archivedate=2014-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-July 2007, Ed Brown also announced that he would stop paying school and town property taxes to the town of [[Plainfield, New Hampshire]]. A local newspaper quoted Brown as saying: "They don't provide me any services, I'm not going to contribute to them anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Brown+decides+property+taxes+are+not+worth+paying&amp;articleId=f0641bba-1067-4421-9187-79da10fc7c00|title=Marathon bombing victims with New Hampshire ties consider jury's decision 'just'    0|work=unionleader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Concord Monitor'' reported that property tax bills were mailed to residents of Plainfield on June 1, 2007, with return envelopes. The ''Monitor'' stated that when an employee of the town of Plainfield opened the return envelope from the Browns, no check for the Browns' property taxes was included. Instead, the Browns included a note with the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nay! Nay! The land… at 401 Center of Town Road, Plainfield, New Hampshire [the Browns' residence], and all that is in and upon it, including the Lords bodies, are in the kingdom of heaven, belonging to the Lord, have been claimed by him, and thus can be claimed by no man, nor can any man have beneficial interest in it… Stand down and away from the Lords land and the bodies of the Lord. So it is written. So it is done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070721/REPOSITORY/707210350 |title=NH news, sports, opinion &amp; photos - Concord Monitor |work=concordmonitor.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125727/http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070721%2FREPOSITORY%2F707210350 |archivedate=2014-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Edward Brown was also quoted as having made comments about law enforcement officials and the judge in his case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wouldn't want to be this U.S. attorney. I wouldn't want to be this judge or these other people. This James John or anybody else that decides to come down here. Their names are already out there… They are just as vulnerable as I am. And if they're so foolish and stupid to think that they're not, hey, doom on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070427/REPOSITORY/704270362/0/OPINION01|title=NH news, sports, opinion &amp; photos - Concord Monitor|work=cmonitor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ed Brown was reported to have stated in a radio interview in March 2007, in comments about federal authorities who were unwilling to see Brown's righteousness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once you've used the lawful word, you've done it the absolute proper way, and they still come at you, they are now attacking the Creator himself or itself,… You kill them. That is exactly what the Ten Commandments tell you to do.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In early June 2007 Brown claimed that the law enforcement officials surrounding his properties were part of a "[[Zionism|Zionist]], [[Illuminati]], [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] movement," and that the federal government had no jurisdiction in New Hampshire.&lt;ref name = Jurisdiction&gt;{{cite news | first = Kristen | last = Senz | title = Ed Brown says Feds have no jurisdiction in New Hampshire | publisher = New Hampshire Union Leader | date = 2007-06-08 | accessdate = 2007-10-20 | url = http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Ed+Brown+says+feds+have+no+jurisdiction+in+New+Hampshire&amp;articleId=844a9c5f-5475-4d71-a149-102ea693ee4b }}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the warrants and court orders against him, Brown said "This is just paper… This is fiction. The entire American government is fiction. We created it, didn't we?"&lt;ref name = Jurisdiction/&gt; The ''New Hampshire Union Leader'' also reported that "the Browns believe the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] and the federal income tax are part of a [[Masonic conspiracy theories|deliberate plot perpetrated by Freemasons]] to control the American people and eventually the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Browns+say+they+will+either+walk+free%2c+or+die&amp;articleId=a02db0e8-8042-474e-8a82-1fb5dc2f6306|title=Marathon bombing victims with New Hampshire ties consider jury's decision 'just'    0|work=unionleader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on February 2, 2007, on the radio show "Constitution for the Defense," Ed Brown was quoted as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the beginning of one very huge movement. I'm not quite sure you understand the ramifications of what's going on right now. This is massive. This is international. We are fed up with the Zionist Illuminati. That's what this is all about. Loud and clear. Zionist Illuminati. Lawyers, whatever they are, okay, it's going to stop. And if the judge is a member of that, I know that McAuliffe [i.e., [[Steven J. McAuliffe]], the Federal judge in Brown's tax case] is, I know that U.S. Attorney Colantuono is, they'd better stop. This is a warning. You can do whatever you want to me. My job is to get the message out, and I'm getting the message out, and I'm warning you guys - not you guys [referring to the radio show hosts], them - to cease and desist their unlawful activity in this country and every other country because once this thing starts, we're going to seek them out and hunt them down. And we're going to bring them to justice. So anybody wishes to join them, you go right ahead and join them.

On August 10, 2007, the ''New Hampshire Union Leader'' reported that Ed Brown said that a war was spreading and becoming an uprising against the federal government, eventually to develop into a revolution, and that the war would come within eighteen months. The ''Union Leader'' quoted Brown:

{{quote|"It has never, ever been resolved without war!" an infuriated Brown shouted during an interview on his porch Wednesday [August 8, 2007].

If federal agents storm Brown's property, he and his supporters will come out shooting. Brown said yesterday [August 9, 2007] that if those agents kill him or his wife, Elaine, his supporters will systematically find and kill Plainfield Police Chief Gordon Gillens, Sullivan County Sheriff Michael Prozzo and others Brown says are sworn to protect him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Brown%3A+War+is+coming&amp;articleId=00e074b4-ebfb-4adb-8ef4-85b4675dd491|title=Marathon bombing victims with New Hampshire ties consider jury's decision 'just'    0|work=unionleader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the ''New Hampshire Union Leader'':

{{quote|He [Ed Brown] points his finger at Freemasons, Zionist Jews and what he says is a secret society known as the [[Illuminati]]. Brown said his extensive research shows these groups are all working together in a global conspiracy.

We're not conspiracy theorists," Brown said, settling into a chair on his unfinished concrete porch. "We deal with conspiracy facts. Freemasonry and Judaism—that is the truth. That is the fact. That is where all the world's problems come from… I know for a fact that they're working together.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}

===October 4, 2007 arrest: The standoff ends===

On October 4, 2007, Ed and Elaine Brown were arrested without incident, ending the standoff. United States Marshal Stephen Monier stated: "The Browns may now begin serving their 63-month federal prison terms… High profile situations like this are always difficult, but they don't have to be tragic. I'm glad no one was injured, and that the community remained safe throughout the operation."&lt;ref name="wcax.com"/&gt;

The Browns were arrested by undercover officers, who were invited by the Browns into the Brown residence on the evening of Thursday, October 4, 2007. "[B]efore the couple realized they weren't supporters, they were already under arrest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmur.com/news/14274183/detail.html|title=Marshals Posed As Supporters To Arrest Browns|date=17 May 2012|work=WMUR|access-date=2007-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906203703/http://www.wmur.com/news/14274183/detail.html|archive-date=2008-09-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local television station quoted U.S. Marshal Monier as saying: "Ultimately, this open-door policy that they [the Browns] seemed to have which allowed the Browns to have some supporters bring them supplies, welcome followers and even host a picnic—this proved to be their undoing… They invited us in. We escorted them out."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

After the arrests, law enforcement personnel began searching the home and found weapons, ammunition, explosive devices and [[booby trap]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Law enforcement officials found twenty "suspected pipe bombs," nine "destructive devices," bags of high explosives hanging in the trees, smoke grenades, materials for partially constructed nail bombs, two .50-caliber rifles, 18 other guns, and over 60,000 rounds of ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071031/NEWS01/710310346 |title=NH news, sports, opinion &amp; photos - Concord Monitor |work=concordmonitor.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084825/http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071031%2FNEWS01%2F710310346 |archivedate=2014-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a news conference on October 5, 2007, U.S. Marshal Monier said that even more charges against the imprisoned Edward and Elaine Brown were likely: "By their continuing actions, allegedly, to obstruct justice, to encourage others to assist them to obstruct justice, by making threats toward law enforcement and other governmental officials, they have turned this into more than a tax case."&lt;ref&gt;http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/N/NH_TAX_EVADERS_ARRESTED_NHOL-?SITE=NHCON&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint '''Fintán''', or '''Munnu'''  (died 635) is one of the Orthodox Saints of Ireland and Britain venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church who served in Ireland and Scotland being the founder and abbot of the abbey at Teach-Mhunn - The House of Saint Munn - where his bed may be visited as a pilgrimage; today [[Taghmon]] is in the [[County Wexford]], in the province of Leinster [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Lanigan"&gt;Lanigan, John: ''An Ecclesiastical History of Ireland, from the First Introduction of Christianity Among the Irish, to the Beginning of the Thirteenth Century, Vol. II., 2nd Edition'', pages 404-409. Simpkin and Marshall, London, 1829.&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, he is venerated as the [[patron saint]] of [[Clan Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Campbell |first=Alister |title=A History of Clan Campbell: From Flodden to the Revolution |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]] |year=2000 |location=Edinburgh |pages=255–256 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ek2lrDPjF0C&amp;pg=PA255 |isbn=1-902930-17-7 |oclc=81142779 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate names==
He was known in Ireland as ''St Fintán'' or ''St Munnu''. In Scotland, he was recorded as ''St Mun'', ''St Munn'', ''St Munda'', ''St Mundas'' and ''St Mund''.&lt;ref name="History of Saint Mun - OLIC" /&gt; The name Fionn was preceded by the term of endearment 'mo', followed by "og", meaning "young". Mo-Fhionn-Og became Munno, the name by which he is popularly known. 
==Biography==
===Early life===
Based on certain linguistic characteristics and some historical references, the earliest life of Fintán/Munna is believed to date around the year 800.&lt;ref name=Culleton&gt;[http://taghmon.com/vol2/8munnac/8munnac.htm Culleton, Edward. "St. Munna Of Taghmon", Taghmon Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Fintán was born of the dynasty of Niall son of Tulchan (or Tulcan)&lt;ref name="Baring-Gould"&gt;Baring-Gould, Sabine: ''The lives of the saints, Vol. 12'' page 558. John Hodges, London, 1877.&lt;/ref&gt; and Feidelmia.&lt;ref name="Lanigan" /&gt; According to the [[Óengus of Tallaght|Felire of Oengus]], Tulchan was a druid.&lt;ref name=Culleton/&gt;

Fintán may have first studied at the school of [[Bangor Abbey]] under [[Comgall|St. Comgall]], and later in the school of Kilmore Deathrib.  It is more certain that he studied 18 years under the abbot Sinell, son of Maynacur, at Cluain-inis in [[Lough Erne]].&lt;ref name="Lanigan" /&gt; [[Columba|St. Columba]] also studied at Cluain-inis under Sinell, but left prior to Munnu's arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Addison, James Thayer: ''Medieval Missionary: A Study of the Conversion of Northern Europe AD 500 to 1300'' page 5. Kessinger Publishing, LLC, August 14, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministry in Scotland===
====Iona monastery====
Fintán  arrived in Scotland in 579 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Munn Family |publisher=ancestry.com |date= |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~keefe/Munn.html |accessdate=2013-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was said to be assisted by two wolves in guarding his sheep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Armstrong |first=Edward Allworthy |title=Saint Francis: Nature Mystic: The Derivation and Significance of the Nature ... |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=1973 |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ReqGZO4nfTYC&amp;pg=PA212 |isbn=0-520-01966-0 |oclc=679220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 597, Fintán  resolved to go to I (now called [[Iona]]) to join the monastery there under [[Columba|St. Columba]].  Just before his departure, news reached him that St. Columba had died and that [[Baithéne mac Brénaind|St. Baithen]] had succeeded him.  Undeterred, Fintán made the journey and applied to St. Baithen for reception into the community. Munnu responded "humbly" as St. Baithen made the customary inquiries into his background.&lt;ref name="Baring-Gould" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lanigan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;Walsh, Thomas: ''History Of The Irish Hierarchy, With The Monasteries Of Each County, Biographical Notices Of The Irish Saints, Prelates, And Religious.'' pages 710-711. D. &amp; J. Sadlier &amp; Co., New York, 1854.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Munnu requested to be admitted as a monk, Baithen replied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
" I thank my God, that you are come to this place; but this you must know: that you cannot be a monk of ours." Fintan much afflicted at these words said; "Is it that I am unworthy of being one?" "No" answered Baithen, "but, although I should be very glad to keep you with me, I must obey the orders of my predecessor Columba, who some time ago said to me in the spirit of prophecy; Baithen remember these words of mine; immediately after my departure from this life, a brother, who is now regulating his youthful age by good conduct, and well versed in sacred studies, named Fintan, of the race of MocuMoie, (74) and son of Failchan, will come to you from Ireland (Scotia) and will supplicate to be reckoned among the monks. But it is predetermined by God, that he is to be an abbot presiding over monks, and a guide of souls. Do not therefore let him remain in these islands of ours, but direct him to return in peace to Ireland (Scotia), - that he may there establish a monastery in a part of Leinster not far from the sea, and labour for the good of souls."&lt;ref name="Lanigan" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Kilmun monastery====
Mun lived on the Island on Loch Leven, before making his way to [[Kilmun]], where he founded a monastic community&lt;ref name="History of Saint Mun - OLIC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="assoc1879"&gt;{{cite book|author=Young men's Catholic assoc|title=Catholic progress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_IDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA114|year=1879|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the site of the modern [[St Munn's Parish Church, Kilmun|Kilmun Church]].

===Ministry in Ireland===
====Wexford monastery====
Fintán  returned to Ireland shortly thereafter to found his monastery.  A local lord in what is modern day [[Wexford]] in [[Leinster]], named Dímma mac Áeda Croin, granted Fintán land circa 597. Munnu, in turn, granted, Dímma his personal guarantee that Dímma would gain the kingdom of heaven.  Fintán at some point took Dímma's son into fosterage, and Dímma later became a cleric and was buried among the monks at the monastery.&lt;ref name="Charles-Edwards"&gt;Charles-Edwards, T.M.: ''Early Christian Ireland'' pages 4,116-118. Cambridge University Press, January 8, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The monastery was named Teach-munnu or "House of Munnu" and became a center of learning. Fintán was versed in scientific knowledge and gave frequent public lectures where Christian revelation was illuminated by the sciences and mathematics.&lt;ref name="Brenan"&gt;[[Michael John Brenan|Brenan, Michael John]]: ''Ecclesiastical History of Ireland from the Introduction Of Christianity Into That Country to the Year MDCCCXXIX. Vol. I.’’  Pages 126, 161. John Coyne, Dublin, 1840.&lt;/ref&gt; Munnu presided over 152 monks at Teach-munnu.&lt;ref name="Baring-Gould" /&gt;
Munnu probably founded a religious establishment at "Kilmund" ([[Kilmun]]).&lt;ref&gt;MacGibbon, David and Thomas Ross: ''The Ecclesiastical Architecture of Scotland'' pages 390-391. George Waterson &amp; Sons, Edinburgh, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; and may have done so at [[Eilean Munde]] as well.&lt;ref name="Baring-Gould" /&gt; However, it is improbable that he is founder of Clonenagh, [[Fintan of Clonenagh]], though they are often confused.&lt;ref name="Lanigan" /&gt;  He did have an abbey in Heli (or Hele, perhaps in [[County Westmeath]]), which he and his monks forsook, giving it to [[Saint Cera]] and her companions.  [[Saint Cera]] named the place, according to Fintán's instructions, after St. Telle who had given three jubilations in the plain of Miodhluachra that day.&lt;ref name="Baring-Gould"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lanigan2"&gt;Lanigan, John: ''An Ecclesiastical History of Ireland, from the First Introduction of Christianity Among the Irish, to the Beginning of the Thirteenth Century, Vol. III., 2nd Edition'', pages 129-131. Simpkin and Marshall, London, 1829.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Hanlon, John: ''Lives of the Irish Saints, Volume VI'', page 801. James Duffy and Sons, Dublin, 1873.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several references to Munnu being a leper.&lt;ref name="Baring-Gould" /&gt;

====Later life====
Toward the end of his life he opposed the adoption of the Roman method for determining the date of Easter.  He strongly promoted the Irish method in opposition to [[Molaise of Leighlin|Laserian]].  A synod convened at Magh Lene in 631 to resolve the matter, but the parties were unable to resolve the matter so a delegation was sent to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Mayr-Harting|Mayr-Harting, Henry]]: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fLrdkyalKpwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The coming of Christianity to Anglo-Saxon England], 3rd Edition'' pages 109-110. [[Pennsylvania State University Press]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Munnu withdrew his opposition, and adopted the Roman system with the rest of southern Ireland.&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt;

In his later years, he was a hermit, living on [[Lough Ree]], Ireland.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Death and burial===
He died on 21 October {{citation needed|date=December 2013}} 635, and was buried in the cemetery at [[Kilmun Parish Church and Argyll Mausoleum|St Munn's Parish Church, Kilmun]], Scotland.&lt;ref name="Catholic Online"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=4675 | title=Saint Mun | publisher=Catholic Online | accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History of Saint Mun - OLIC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stmuns.com/st-mun-s-church-history-page/what-we-believe | title=History of Saint Mun | publisher=Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception and St Mun | accessdate=20 December 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221132019/http://www.stmuns.com/st-mun-s-church-history-page/what-we-believe | archivedate=21 December 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration as a Saint==
His feast day is on 5 February &lt;ref name="Catholic Online" /&gt; and/or 21 October.&lt;ref name="History of Saint Mun - OLIC" /&gt; Fintán is associated with several tales of miracles and is recorded to have been visited by an angel.&lt;ref name="Baring-Gould" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3326">'''Georgios Sekeris'''  ( ; - [[1822]] ) was a member of [[Filiki Eteria]] and a fighter of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. He was the first to be initiated into Filiki Eteria in Moscow by [[Nikolaos Skoufas]] in [[1814]].

==Biography==
He was the younger brother of [[Panagiotis Sekeris|Panagiotis]] and [[Athanasios Sekeris]]. He took his first steps in education at the well-known school of [[Dimitsana]] and later, in [[1808]], he followed his brother Panagiotis in [[Constantinople]], where he continued his studies. Georgios didn’t wish to become a trader, but he wanted to study military science instead. In [[1811]], Panagiotis Sekeris sent him to apprentice at the centers of [[Greeks|Greek]] intellectuals ([[Bucharest]], [[Iași]], [[Moscow]], [[Vienna]]). In [[1813]] he went to [[Paris]], where he became acquainted with [[Adamantios Korais]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Visvizi-Donda [Δ. Βισβίζη-Δοντά], «''Η ανεξαρτησία της Ελλάδος και η οικογένεια Σέκερη''», Μνημοσύνη, vol. ΙΣΤ΄, 2003-2005, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814 Georgios traveled to Moscow, because he wanted to visit his brother Athanasios. While he was there, he met [[Athanasios Tsakalov]], an acquaintance from Paris, who told him about the purpose of Filiki Eteria, a secret organization that he recently founded together with Nikolaos Skoufas and Emmanuil Xanthos. Georgios was the first member who was initiated into Filiki Eteria.&lt;ref&gt;Ioannis Meletopoulos [Ιωάννης Μελετόπουλος], ''Η Φιλική Εταιρεία, Αρχείον Π. Σέκερη'', Αθήνα, 1967, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; On his way back to Paris he passed Vienna, where he met with [[Anthimos Gazis]], a priest and scholar from Milies in Pelion, and initiated him into Filiki Eteria as well.&lt;ref&gt;D. Visvizi-Donda, 2003-2005, p. 288-289.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Greek Revolution broke out he decided to rerun home. He set off from [[Marseille]] on the 18th of July 1821, on a brig charted by [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]], and arrived at [[Missolonghi]] on the 21st of July. From Messolonghi he went to the camp in Trikorfa, where Demetrios Ypsilantis was. Georgios followed Alexandros Mavrokordatos to Zarakova, where proestoi, the local notables, gathered in order to form the country's governing body. When he returned to Trikorfa, the Siege of Tripolitsa had begun. There, Georgios excelled due to his great abilities and bravery. He was appointed chieftain of Mantineian army but later his duties were restricted and he became an army leader of Tripolitsa province. He took part in the Siege of Old Patras, where he excelled in the battle on the 9th of March 1822, and in the Battles of Dervenakia, of Agios Sostis and of Agionori on the 26th-28 July [[1822]].

When Dramalis’s army was defeated they fled to Corinth, but they were followed by [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]], who led the siege of Corinth. Then, the people from Tripolitsa stayed in Dervenakia under the leadership of Georgios Sekeris. However, Georgios exhausted by the hardships of war fell ill and was taken to Tripoli, where he died on November 12, [[1822]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Visvizi-Donda, 2003-2005, p. 324-325.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 2016, Mashaba was elected [[City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality|Mayor of Johannesburg]] by the first sitting of council following countrywide local government elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/live-city-of-johannesburg-inaugural-council-meeting-20160822|title=LIVE: Mayor Mashaba - Corruption is public enemy number 1|work=News24|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career==
Mashaba was brought up in near-poverty in GaRamotse in [[Hammanskraal]], Gauteng, by his sisters while his absent domestic-worker mother worked to provide for the family.

His older brother dropped out of school at 15, going from one unsubstantial job to another. Mashaba realised that an education would be crucial for him to break out of the cycle of poverty. He graduated from high school, but did not complete his tertiary education.

From a young age he was a strategic thinker - he bought a car without having a license and drove out of the dealership without ever having learned to drive. He drove himself from one selling job to another, in the process confirming for himself that he was a natural salesman with an unswerving instinct for business. He started selling "SuperKurl" African hair-care products and became their number-one earner.  He soon realised that these products excited him and that he wasn't content to be just an employee. (Reference: Book titled "South Africa's Greatest Entrepreneurs", compiled by Moky Makura, article written by Isabella Morris)

His company, "Black Like Me", was launched on Valentine’s Day in 1985 with a {{currency|amount=30000|code=ZAR}} loan from his friend, businessman Walter Dube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/the-star/story-of-black-like-me-and-the-man-behind-it-1297341#.VYsMfflVikp|title=Story of Black Like Me, and the man behind it {{!}} The Star|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;



Mashaba is also a music lover. After five years of secret lessons, he revealed himself as a pianist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://city-press.news24.com/News/on-the-streets-with-herman-mashaba-20160313|title=On the streets with Herman Mashaba|work=CityPress|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
From 2012 until May 2014, Mashaba served as chairman of the [[Free Market Foundation]] (FMF).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moneyweb.co.za/news/economy/anc-policies-keeping-black-people-poor-says-herman-mashaba/|title=ANC policies keeping black people poor, says Herman Mashaba|last=Ziady|first=Hanna|date=2016-02-05|work=Moneyweb|access-date=2017-05-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stepped down from his position when he joined the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] as an "ordinary card-carrying member", citing the need for the Foundation to remain politically impartial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moneyweb.co.za/archive/herman-mashaba-to-join-the-da/|title=FMF chairman steps down to join the DA|date=2014-05-28|work=Moneyweb|access-date=2017-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mashaba announced in December 2015 that he would accept a nomination to stand as a [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] mayoral candidate for the [[City of Johannesburg]] in the 2016 local government elections. The other possible DA candidate was [[Rabelani Dagada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/herman-mashaba-announced-as-das-joburg-mayoral-candidate-20160116|title=Herman Mashaba announced as DA's Joburg mayoral candidate|work=News24|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mayor of Johannesburg ===
In the municipal election on August 3, 2016, the ruling party, The [[African National Congress]], lost their majority in Johannesburg, taking only 44.12% of the vote with the Democratic alliance taking 38.33%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elections.org.za/content/LGEPublicReports/402/Detailed%20Results/GP/JHB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Democratic Alliance entered into conversations with the [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] to form a coalition. Whilst the EFF declined the offer, they agreed that they would vote for Mashaba as the Mayor for Johannesburg, despite misgivings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/elections/news/eff-will-vote-for-mashaba-says-malema-20160818|title=EFF will vote for Mashaba, says Malema|work=News24|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 2016, Mashaba was sworn in as a Johannesburg City Councillor. Later that day, he was sworn in as the Mayor of Johannesburg, the first non-ANC Johannesburg mayor since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2016/08/22/Victory-for-DA-as-Herman-Mashaba-is-elected-Mayor-of-Johannesburg|title=Victory for DA as Herman Mashaba is elected Mayor of Johannesburg|last=Manyathela|first=Clement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labour ===
Mashaba has characterised the ANC's post-Apartheid labour laws as "draconian".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He led a Constitutional Court challenge by the FMF, arguing that Section 32 of the Labour Relations Act is unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The FMF argued that the bargaining council process reduces competition, as smaller businesses may not be able to afford the higher wages agreed on between larger businesses and unions, contributing further to South Africa's unemployment rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moneyweb.co.za/archive/collusion-in-labour-legislation-decisionmaking/|title=Collusion in labour legislation decision-making|last=Radebe|first=Kentse|date=2013-03-05|work=Moneyweb|access-date=2017-05-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horst Schumann''' (1 May 1906 – 5 May 1983), ''SS-[[Sturmbannführer]]'' (major) and medical doctor, conducted [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] and [[castration]] experiments at [[Auschwitz]] and was particularly interested in the mass sterilization of [[Judaism|Jews]] by means of [[X-ray]]s.

==Early life==
Schumann was born on 1 May 1906 in [[Halle an der Saale]]. His father, Paul Schumann, was also a doctor. Schumann entered the [[NSDAP|Nazi party]] in 1930 and joined the [[Sturmabteilung]] in 1932. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}} In 1933, he received his medical degree after producing a thesis entitled "''Frage der Jodresorption und der therapeutischen Wirkung sog. Jodbäder''" ("The Question of Iodine Absorption and the Therapeutic Effects of so-called Iodine Baths"). He started his career as an assistant doctor in the Surgical Clinic of the clinic of [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|Halle University]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Nazi doctor==
From 1934, Schumann was employed in the Public Health Office in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]]. He was recruited to the air force as a physician in 1939. He joined the [[Action T4|''Aktion'' T4]] Euthanasia program in early October 1939, after a meeting with Dr. [[Viktor Brack]] in Hitler's chancellery. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}} In January 1940, Schumann  became head of the [[Grafeneck]] euthanasia centre in Württemberg, where mentally ill people were gassed with [[carbon monoxide]] in the first gas chamber. In the early summer of 1940, he was ordered to the [[Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre]]. Schumann also belonged to a commission of doctors called "[[Action 14f13]]", who transferred weak and sick prisoners from [[Auschwitz]], [[Buchenwald]], [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]], [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|Gross-Rosen]], [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]], [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]] and Niederhangen concentration camps to the euthanasia killing centers. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Auschwitz==
On 28 July 1941, Schumann arrived in [[Auschwitz]]. He worked at Block 30 in the women's hospital, where he set up an x-ray station in 1942. Here men and women were forcibly sterilized by being positioned repeatedly for several minutes between two x-ray machines, the rays aiming at their sexual organs. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Most subjects died after great suffering, or were gassed immediately because the radiation burns from which they suffered rendered them unfit for work. Men's testicles were removed and sent to [[Breslau]] for histopathological examination. Schumann "...chose his test persons himself. They were always young, healthy, good-looking Jewish men, women and girls who looked like old people afterwards. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The parts of the body that were treated with the rays were burnt, suppurating. Often the intestines were also affected. Many died. Part of Schumann's control tests, to check whether the radiation had worked, was the so-called semen check: a stick covered with a rubber hose was inserted into the rectum of the victim and the glands stimulated until ejaculation occurred so that the ejaculate could be tested for sperm..." &lt;ref&gt;Klee, 53&lt;/ref&gt; Both kinds of samples were sent to the University of [[Breslau]] (today [[Wrocław]]) for examination.
[[File:Auschwitz-Birkenau Hauptgebäude.jpg|thumb|right|Remains of the building at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz II (Birkenau)]] where Schumann committed his medical atrocities.]]

Schumann selected some of the women in [[Block 10]] in the main camp of Auschwitz. In this Block Jewish women had been imprisoned for human experiments. To control the radiation on women, prisoner doctors (Dr. Maximilian Samuel, Dr. Wladislaw Dering) had to remove an ovary.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 132-143&lt;/ref&gt;

Schumann also performed [[typhus]] experiments by injecting people with blood from typhus patients and then attempting to cure the newly infected subjects. Schumann left Auschwitz in September 1944 and was appointed to the [[Sonnenstein Clinic]] in [[Saxony]] which had earlier been converted into a military hospital. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Medical career after the war==
While serving as a military doctor on the Western Front, he was captured by the Americans in January 1945. He was released from captivity in October 1945. In April 1946, he began to work as a sports doctor for the city of [[Gladbeck]]. An application for a license for a hunting gun led to his being identified in 1951 so the GDR issued an arrest warrant. According to his own statement, Schumann served as a ship’s doctor for three years and because he did not have a German passport, he applied for one in Japan in 1954 and received it under his own name. Schumann then fled, first to [[Egypt]] and eventually settled in [[Khartoum]] in the [[Sudan]] as head of a hospital. He was forced to flee from Sudan in 1962 after being recognized by an Auschwitz survivor. Then he went to Ghana, where he received the protection of the head of state, [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In 1966, he was extradited from [[Ghana]] to [[West Germany]]  where the trial against him was opened in [[Frankfurt]] on 23 September 1970. However, Schumann was released from prison on 29 July 1972 due to his heart condition and generally deteriorating health. He did not die until 5 May 1983, 11 years after he had been released. As [[Robert Jay Lifton]] has observed "...Schumann has great importance for us because of what he did – intense involvement in both direct medical killing and unusually brutal Auschwitz experiments – and what he was – an ordinary, but highly Nazified man and doctor..." &lt;ref&gt;Lipton, p.&amp;nbsp;284&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jaak Jõerüüt''' (born 9 December 1947 in [[Tallinn]]) is an [[Estonians|Estonian]] writer and politician. He was the [[defense minister]] of [[Estonia]] from November 2004 to 10 October 2005.

Jõerüüt first came to political prominence when he became one of the voters for the [[Estonian restoration of Independence]]. He was then appointed to be Minister of Defence in November 2004 in [[Juhan Parts]]'s government. When Parts resigned in April 2005, Jaak Jõerüüt was one of the few ministers retained in [[Andrus Ansip]]'s government.

In September 2005, Jõerüüt resigned voluntarily over the so-called "T-Shirt Affair". (A T-shirt was produced with a list of the names of several Estonian politicians, including Jõerüüt, who are former members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|communist party]]; it was headed "Commies into the Oven!"&lt;ref&gt;

Jõerüüt was succeeded by [[Jürgen Ligi]].

Jõerüüt previously served as Estonia's ambassador to the [[United Nations]] in 2004. He served as ambassador to [[Italy]] and [[Malta]] from 1998 through 2002, and ambassador to [[Cyprus]] from 1999 through 2004. From 1993 to 1997, Jõerüüt was ambassador to [[Finland]] and from 2006 to 2010 to [[Latvia]] and now to [[Sweden]] from 2011.

{{Listen|filename=Captain Jerry Roberts.ogg|title=The voice of Captain Jerry Roberts MBE|type=speech|description=recorded October 2012}}

'''Captain Raymond C. "Jerry" Roberts''', [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (18 November 1920 – 25 March 2014) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] wartime codebreaker and businessman. During the [[Second World War]], Roberts worked at the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]] at [[Bletchley Park]] from 1941-45. He was a leading codebreaker and linguist, who worked on the [[Lorenz cipher]] system — Hitler's most top-level code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26759034|work=[[BBC News]]|title=Last Bletchley Park codebreaker Jerry Roberts dies, aged 93|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=26 March 2014|accessdate=26 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerry Roberts was born in [[Wembley]], [[London]]. His father Herbert, had trained as a pharmacist, but worked for Lloyds Bank head office in the [[City of London|City]] for the rest of his 40-year career (since coming to London from Wales in 1915). His mother Leticia was a pianist and an organist who played in the local chapel. He was educated at [[Latymer Upper School]], [[Hammersmith]] in London 1933-39 and [[University College London]] 1939-41. He gained a degree in [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]].

==War service==
Early in the [[Second World War]], his tutor at [[University College London]], Prof. Leonard Willoughby, who had worked during the [[First World War]] in [[Room 40]] the main cipher-breaking unit of that time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Swales|first=Martin|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Willoughby, Leonard Ashley (1885–1977), German scholar|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended the twenty-year-old Jerry Roberts as a German linguist to the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] at Bletchley Park where he was interviewed and accepted by Colonel [[John Tiltman]] as a codebreaker and linguist.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The [[Testery]], a special unit at Bletchley Park tasked with breaking the [[Lorenz cipher]] code named ‘Tunny’ by the British. This was the Nazis’ highest-level communications cipher system, which was used for communications between the Germany Army High Command in Berlin and their Army Commands in the field throughout occupied Europe, some of which were signed "Adolf Hitler, Führer".{{sfn|McKay|2010|loc = p. 263 quoting Jerry Roberts}} Captain Roberts was one of the four founding members, the other two senior cryptanalysts were Major Denis Oswald and Captain Peter Ericsson. The head of the unit Major [[Ralph Tester]], was a linguist but not cryptanalyst.

Jerry Roberts worked in the [[Testery]] until the end of the war, by which time it had grown to nine cryptanalysts, a team of 24 ATS ladies, and a total staff of 118. Work was organised in three shifts working round the clock. Roberts was one of the three shift-leaders&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first year, the messages that were broken by hand amounted to 1.5 million pieces. The [[Newmanry]], which became active in July 1943, developed and used machine methods to help speed up one stage — breaking of the chi-wheels but the psi-wheels and motor-wheels were still broken by hand in the Testery. From mid-1943 onwards, the Testery is credited with breaking over 90% of Lorenz traffic.

[[Lorenz cipher]] was [[Adolf Hitler]]’s most secret code system and had 12 wheels against well-known 3 wheel [[Enigma machine|Enigma]]. [[Lorenz cipher]] was only declassified in 2002 compared with Enigma in the 1970s. Lorenz carried only the highest grade of intelligence; messages signed only by a handful of top generals and fieldmarshals, included Adolf Hitler himself. Used between Army HQ in [[Berlin]] and the generals and fieldmarshals in the field. Many were signed by Field Marshals: von Rundstedt, Rommel, Keitel, Jodl etc. – as well as a number of messages signed by the [[Führer]] himself.

Tens of thousands of Lorenz messages were intercepted by the British and broken at Bletchley Park by Captain Roberts and his fellow code-breakers in the Testery. These messages contained much vital insight into top-level German thinking and planning. Tunny provided vital information that changed the course of the war in Europe and saved tens of millions of lives at critical junctures — such as the [[Battle of Kursk]] in the [[Soviet Union]], and D-Day. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] (later the U.S President 1953-61) said after the war "Bletchley decrypts shortened the war by at least 2 years".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Post-war==
After the war, Jerry Roberts was a member of the War Crimes Investigation Unit. Thereafter he pursued a new career in market research for 50 years, forming his own market research companies in the 1970s (one for the UK, one for the rest of Europe) until they were sold to GfK NOP (National Opinion Polls) in 1993 and continued working as a consultant to NOP assisting with multi-country studies until he was nearly eighty. He spoke fluent German, French and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and used his skill in languages in his work.

* 1945–47 — After the war, Jerry Roberts was a member of the War Crimes Investigation Unit. There he employed his fluency in the German and French languages while working in the [[Allied-occupied Germany|British Zone]], interviewing witness, victims and various war cases, taking legal statements from them for use in court. 
* 1948–54 — Started in market research in London working for Market Information Services (MIS), a leading market research firm.
* 1954–59 — In [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], Jerry was invited to set up the first general research company in [[South America]] (where he learned to speak fluent Spanish) and developed the company DATOS.
* 1960 — Jerry spent the year in [[New York City|New York]], as a manager representing a major international advertising agency (CPV).
* 1961–69 — He returned to London as board director of M.I.S.
* 1970–93 — Jerry Roberts set up his own companies: Roberts Research Ltd and Euroresearch Ltd, and applied his language skills to pioneering multi-country market research studies across Europe for leading UK and multinational companies. Jerry carried out market research for a wide range of leading UK and international clients in the fields of product marketing, public opinion and media research. His clients included [[British Gas plc|British Gas]], [[Reebok]] [[Athletic shoe|trainers]], [[DuPont]] [[Teflon]], [[Lycra]], [[American Airlines]], [[Chrysler]] cars, [[Holiday Inn]] hotels and many others. In 1993, NOP (National Opinion Poll) bought both of his companies.

==In retirement==

Captain Roberts was the last survivor of the nine cryptanalysts who worked on [[Lorenz cipher]]. For the last six years of his life, he campaigned for proper recognition for Bletchley Park's 4Ts — for his colleagues in the Testery, and especially for its three "Heroes": [[Alan Turing]] who broke the naval Enigma, [[Bill Tutte]] who broke the [[Lorenz cipher]] system to help shorten the war, and [[Tommy Flowers]] who designed and built the Colossus, the world's first large-scale [[electronics|electronic]], [[Digital data|digital]], [[Computer programming|programmable]] [[computer]] —  to vastly speed up one stage (chi-wheel) of the breaking of Tunny traffic. However, the majority (the rest of 5 stages) of the work was performed by hand in the [[Testery]] by codebreakers and support staff.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=253}}

Roberts was honoured several times for his historic achievements. In July 2011, he was presented to [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in July 2011 at Bletchley Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Captain Jerry Roberts: Former Bletchley Park Codebreaker from 1941-45 |year=2011 |url=http://jerryroberts.posterous.com |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324090900/http://jerryroberts.posterous.com/ |archivedate=24 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, Roberts was featured in a [[Timewatch|BBC Timewatch]] Special titled ''Code-Breakers: Bletchley Park's Lost Heroes'', first broadcast on [[BBC Two]] on 25 October 2011. In 2013, he received an [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] [[New Years Honours List]] and awarded a UCL Honorary Fellowship. The same year, he was also honoured with an investiture stamp, which is available through Bletchley Park Post Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://secure16.host-it.co.uk/bletchleycovers_co_uk/store/StockDetail.asp?id=496 | title=Jerry Roberts Investiture |work=Bletchley Park Post Office | accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With characteristic modesty, he accepted all of these accolades as acknowledgment not of his own accomplishments, but of the work of his teammates at Bletchley Park, most of whom died unrecognised, before Tunny was declassified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0314/270314-tribute-to-captain-jerry-roberts-mbe/ | title=Tribute to Captain Jerry Roberts MBE | work=UCL News | date=27 March 2014 | accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Roberts' autobiography was published in March 2017, titled 'Lorenz: Breaking Hitler's top secret code at Bletchley-Park'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/publication/lorenz/9780750978859/ http://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/articles/how-lorenz-was-different-from-enigma/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Linnell by John Linnell.jpg|right|thumb|Self-portrait of John Linnell, circa 1860]]
[[File:John Linnell - Wheat - Google Art Project.jpg|300px|thumb|Wheat, circa 1860]]
'''John Linnell''' (16 June 1792 – 20 January 1882) was an [[England|English]] [[landscape painter|landscape]] and [[portrait]] [[painting|painter]] and [[engraving|engraver]]. Linnell was a [[naturalist]] and a rival to [[John Constable]]. He had a taste for Northern European art of the [[Renaissance]], particularly [[Albrecht Dürer]]. He also associated with [[William Blake]], to whom he introduced [[Samuel Palmer]] and others of [[Ancients (art group)|the Ancients]].

==Life and work==
Linnell was born in [[Bloomsbury]], London. His father was a carver and gilder and Linnell was brought into contact with artists from an early age, and was drawing and selling portraits in chalk and pencil at the age of 10. His first artistic instruction was received from [[Benjamin West]], and he spent a year in the house of [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]] the water-colour painter, where he had [[William Henry Hunt (painter)|William Hunt]] and [[William Mulready]] as fellow-pupils, and made the acquaintance of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[Edward William Godwin|Godwin]] and other men of mark. In 1805 he was admitted a student of the Royal Academy, where he obtained medals for drawing, modelling and sculpture. He was trained as an engraver, and executed a transcript of Varley's "Burial of Saul."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
[[File:John Linnell - Hanson Toot, View in Dovedale - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|View in [[Dovedale]], 1815]]

In later life he occupied himself with the [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], publishing, in 1833, a series of outlines from [[Michelangelo]]'s frescoes in the [[Sistine Chapel]], and, in 1840, superintending the issue of a selection of plates from the pictures in [[Buckingham Palace]], one of them, a [[Titian]] landscape, which he engraved in [[mezzotint]]. At first he supported himself mainly by miniature painting and execution of larger portraits, such as the likenesses of Mulready, [[Richard Whately]], Peel and [[Thomas Carlyle]]. Several of his portraits he engraved in line and mezzotint.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He painted many subjects like the "St John Preaching," the "Covenant of Abraham," and the "Journey to Emmaus," in which, while the landscape is usually prominent the figures are of sufficient importance to supply the title of the work. But it is mainly in connexion with paintings of pure landscapes that his name is known. His works commonly deal with some scene of typical uneventful English landscape, which is made impressive by a gorgeous effect of sunrise or sunset. They are full of true poetic feeling, and are rich and glowing in colour.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Linnell commanded large prices for his pictures, and about 1850 he purchased a property at Redhill, Surrey, where he lived till his death on 20 January 1882, painting with unabated powers until within the last few years of his life. He devoted himself to painting landscapes notably of the [[North Downs]] and [[The Weald|Kentish Weald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilton and Lyles|first=Andrew Wilton and Anne Lyles, Royal Academy of Arts (Great Britain), National Gallery of Art (U.S.)|title=The great age of British watercolours, 1750-1880|year=1993|publisher=Prestel-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=9783791312545|pages=339}} page 318&lt;/ref&gt;  His leisure was occupied with a study of the [[Bible]] in the original, and he published several pamphlets and treatises of Biblical criticism. Linnell was one of the best friends and kindest patrons of [[William Blake]]. He gave him the two largest commissions he received for single series of designs—£150 for drawings and engravings of ''The Inventions to the Book of Job'', and a like sum for those illustrative of [[Dante Aligheri]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He was a friend of the painter [[Edward Thomas Daniell]]. A [[blue plaque]] commemorates Linnell at Old Wyldes' at North End, [[Hampstead]].

'''Kalangi Nathar''' was the guru of [[Bhogar]] (or Bhogarnathar). Kalangi Nathar was from [[Benaras]].
Kalangi Nathar and Bogar were considered to possess an ideal master and student relationship.  It is said that they had a mutual care among both of them in their own spiritual progresses.  Kalangi Nathar, especially took more care and strain towards the spiritual advancement of his disciple bogar.  Kalangi Nathar was behind Bogar's every development and his innovations for the world.

He is often referred to us '''[[Kanjamalai]] Siddhar'''. The word "kanjam" stands for the following meaning&amp;nbsp;— gold, copper and Iron and malai means hill. It is said that Paranthaka Chozha who built Sri Nataraja temple with golden roof, took the gold from this hill. Also the water falls seen in this hill is called "Ponni Nadhi".

He is the disciple to the great siddha [[Thirumoolar]]. He is one among the seven disciples whom Thirumoolar transcended his knowledge, the other six being Indran, Soman, Rudhran, Kanduru, Brahman, and Kanjamalaiyan.

The shrine of Kalangi Nathar is found in a small village in Salem, Tamil Nadu. This village is 12&amp;nbsp;km away from Salem City. This place is in via route to Ilampillai.

He is supposed to have attained [[Samadhi]] in this place several hundred years ago.

Kalanginathar is Boghar's father according to Boghar's poem. Boghar glorifies Kalanginathar in many of his verses.

Kalanginathar is said to be the primary disciple of Thirumoolar Sithar, He went on to China by the use of a tablet, and attained mukthi (immortal status) in Kanchipupram. His jeeva samadhi is found in Kanchipuram district of Tamil Nadu. He has a very special temple in Sivadhapauram to Ellampillai, which is called as Sithar Koil in the same area. It is situated at the grounds of [[Kanjamalai]]. This temple is associated with a Kali temple in the left and Murugan in the upstairs respectively.

The following information is available about Sri Kamalamuni in the book ''Bogar 7000'' written by siddhar Bogar.
Song 5729: Kamalamuni was born on the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May&amp;nbsp;— June), his birth star being 2nd part of Poosam.
Song 5725: The siddhar named Kamalamuni belongs to Kuravar caste. He lived for six-eight generations.
Song 5841: Kamalamuni is 4000 years and some 300 odd (days) old. He lived in China for a long time.

However, siddhar Karuvoorar in his book ''Vadha Kaviyam'' (Song 584) says that "Maamuni" belongs to "Kannar" caste. He does not explicitly say "Kamalamuni", but mentions "Maamuni". It is not known whether Karuvoorar refers to Kamalamuni or not.{{cn|date=November 2014}}

Sri Kalangi Nadhar since mentioned as Bogar's father we can know that he comes from a caste called porkollar/vishwakarma/gold smith and this is mentioned by Bogar himself in his book Bogar 7000. Many people believe that Sri Kalangi Nathar is siddhar Kamalamuni. In the 63rd song of ''Kamalamuni Suthiram 76'', a line says that 'Kamalamuni alias Kalangi". Hence it may be true that Sri Kalangi Nathar is siddhar Kamalamuni himself.

In ''Bogar Janana Sasthra'', it is mentioned that Kamalamuni attained samadhi at Madurai. It is believed that siddhar Kamalamuni attained samadhi at Thiruvavur.

Kalangi Nathar was an Indian ascetic who had gone to China. Kalangi Nathar belongs to both Nath tradition of Northern India and also the Siddha tradition of Southern India. Kalangi Nathar is associated with Kaanja Malai in South India and later migrated and lived in China and spread the knowledge of yoga and Varma-Kalai (acupuncture) to the Chinese people. In China he is called Confucius. Kalangi Nathar decided to go into Samadhi for a very long time (for about 5000-years), and called Bogar to come to China to continue his mission. According to Chinese tradition, Laozi lived in the 6th century BC, however many historians contend that Laozi actually lived in the 4th century BC, which was the period of Hundred Schools of Thought and Warring States Period, whereas Confucius was born in 551 BCE in Lu, a small state in China and died in 479 BCE (as per Chinese sources). This shows that Confucius was elder to Laozi. Bhoganathar who is called Laozi/Lao Tzu in China, was the successor of Kalangi Nathar (Confucius).

After winning 71 consecutive basketball games on his high school team in New York City, Alcindor was recruited by [[Jerry Norman (basketball)|Jerry Norman]], the assistant coach of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bruinsnation.com/2014/8/17/6027723/ucla-basketball-wooden-part-4-recruiting-lew-alcindor&lt;/ref&gt; where he played for coach [[John Wooden]] on three consecutive national championship teams and was a record three-time MVP of the NCAA Tournament. Drafted with the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall pick]] by the one-season-old Bucks franchise in the [[1969 NBA draft]], Alcindor spent six seasons in Milwaukee. After leading the Bucks to its first NBA championship at age 24 in 1971, he took the [[Muslim]] name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Using his trademark "[[Hook shot|skyhook]]" shot, he established himself as one of the league's top scorers. In 1975, he was traded to the Lakers, with whom he played the last 14 seasons of his career and won five additional NBA championships. Abdul-Jabbar's contributions were a key component in the "[[Showtime (basketball)|Showtime]]" era of Lakers basketball. Over his 20-year NBA career, his team succeeded in making the playoffs 18 times and past the first round in 14 of them; his team reached the NBA Finals 10 times.

At the time of his retirement in 1989, Abdul-Jabbar was the NBA's all-time leader in [[point (basketball)|points scored]] (38,387), [[games played]] (1,560), [[Minute (basketball)|minutes played]] (57,446), [[Field goal (basketball)|field goals]] made (15,837), field goal attempts (28,307), [[Block (basketball)|blocked shots]] (3,189), defensive [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] (9,394), career wins (1,074), and [[Personal foul (basketball)|personal fouls]] (4,657).

==UCLA==
Alcindor played on the UCLA freshman team in 1966 only because the "freshman rule" was in effect, but his prowess was already well known.&lt;ref name=almbgrts&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R7BhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w-gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4735%2C2683757 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington)|agency=Associated Press |last=McSweeney |first=John |title=Rival cage coaches agree Alcindor may be greatest |date=February 25, 1966|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1967 to 1969, he played on the varsity under head coach [[John Wooden]]. He was the main contributor to the team's three-year record of 88 wins and only two losses: one to the [[1967–68 Houston Cougars men's basketball team|University of Houston]] in which Alcindor had an eye injury, and the other to crosstown rival [[USC Trojans men's basketball|USC]] who played a "stall game" (i.e., there was no shot clock in those days, so a team could hold the ball as long as it wanted before attempting to score). In his first game, Alcindor scored 56 points, which set a UCLA single-game record.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;
[[File:Lew Alcindor Kareem Abdul-Jabbar UCLA.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Alcindor with the reverse two-hand dunk in a game against [[Stanford Cardinal men's basketball|Stanford]].]]

During his college career, Alcindor was twice named Player of the Year (1967, 1969); was a three-time First Team [[All-American]] (1967–1969); played on three NCAA basketball champion teams ([[1967 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1967]], [[1968 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1968]] and [[1969 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1969]]); was honored as the Most Outstanding Player in the NCAA Tournament (1967, 1968, 1969); and became the first-ever [[Naismith College Player of the Year]] in 1969.

In 1967 and 1968, he also won [[USBWA College Player of the Year]], which later became the [[Oscar Robertson Trophy]]. Alcindor became the only player to win the [[Helms Foundation Player of the Year]] award three times. The 1965–66 UCLA Bruin team was the preseason #1. On November 27, 1965, the freshman team, led by Alcindor, defeated the varsity 75–60 in the first game in the new [[Pauley Pavilion]].&lt;ref&gt;Florence, Mal – Who's No. 1? UCLA Frosh Too Hot for Varsity, 75–60. Los Angeles Times, November 28, 1965. Quote:''Lew Alcindor strode onto the Pauley Pavilion court Saturday night and captured the town, completely demoralizing the UCLA varsity basketball team in the process.''&lt;/ref&gt; Alcindor scored 31 points and had 21 rebounds in what was a good indication of things to come. After the game, the UCLA varsity was #1 in the country but #2 on campus. If the "freshman rule" had not been in effect at that time, UCLA would have had a much better chance of winning the 1966 National Championship.

Alcindor had considered transferring to [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]] because of unfulfilled recruiting promises. UCLA player [[Willie Naulls]] introduced Alcindor and teammate [[Lucius Allen]] to athletic booster [[Sam Gilbert (businessman)|Sam Gilbert]], who convinced the pair to remain at UCLA.&lt;ref name="SAMCAGERS"&gt;{{cite news|last=Florence|first=Mal|title=Papa Sam Gilbert is someone special to UCLA cagers|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Zj0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2WYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7090%2C2889137|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|location=(Florida)|agency=''(Los Angeles Times)'' |date=April 7, 1974|page=7D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Slam dunk|dunk]] was banned in college basketball after the 1967 season, primarily because of Alcindor's dominant use of the shot.&lt;ref name="greatath"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836963,00.html Lew's Still Loose]. ''Time Magazine'', April 14, 1967. Quote: "First there was the Wilt Chamberlain Rule, designed to force him away from the basket by widening the '3-sec. zone', in which an offensive player can remain for only 3&amp;nbsp;sec. at a time. Next came the Bill Russell Rule, which forbids blocking a shot when the ball is on its downward course. Now there is the Lew Alcindor Rule. College basketball's rules makers decided last week that players may no longer 'dunk' or 'stuff' the ball by ramming it through the hoop from directly above."&lt;/ref&gt; The rule was not rescinded until the 1976–77 season, which was shortly after Wooden's retirement.

During his junior year, Alcindor suffered a scratched left [[cornea]] on January 12, 1968, in a game against Cal when he was struck by Tom Henderson in a rebound battle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Prugh |first=Jeff |title=Bruins win again without Alcindor. Big Lew Sidelined By Eye Injury Suffered in Game against Bears | newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 14, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would miss the next two games against Stanford and Portland.&lt;ref name="greatath"/&gt; This happened right before the showdown game against Houston. His cornea would again be scratched during his pro career, which subsequently caused him to wear [[goggles]] for eye protection.

===Conversion to Islam and 1968 Olympic boycott===
During the summer of 1968, Alcindor took the ''[[shahada]]'' twice and converted to [[Sunni Islam]], though he did not begin publicly using his Arabic name until 1971.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Muslim-American History"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Edward E. Curtis IV |editor= |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Muslim-American History |title= |edition=1 |date=June 2010 |publisher=Facts On File, Inc |id= |isbn=978-1-4381-3040-8 |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He boycotted the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] by deciding not to try out for the [[Basketball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|United States Men's Olympic Basketball team]]. This action was in protest to the unequal treatment of African-Americans in the United States.

He was one of only four players who started on three NCAA championship teams; the others all played for Wooden at UCLA: [[Henry Bibby]], [[Curtis Rowe]] and [[Lynn Shackelford]]. In sharp contrast to what goes on today, Alcindor did not declare early for the NBA draft. He completed his studies and earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] with a major in history in 1969. In his free time, he practiced martial arts. He studied Jeet Kune Do under [[Bruce Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://lakersblog.latimes.com/lakersblog/2006/01/talking_with_ka_2.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Lakers Now | date=January 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game of the Century===

{{Main|Game of the Century (college basketball)}}
On January 20, 1968, Alcindor and the UCLA Bruins faced coach [[Guy Lewis]]'s [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|Houston Cougars]] in the first-ever nationally televised regular-season college basketball game, with 52,693 in attendance at the [[Astrodome]]. Cougar forward [[Elvin Hayes]] scored 39 points and had 15 rebounds, while Alcindor, who suffered from a scratch on his left cornea, was held to just 15 points as Houston won 71–69. The Bruins' 47-game winning streak ended in what has been called the "[[Game of the Century (college basketball)|Game of the Century]]". Hayes and Alcindor had a rematch in the Final Four of the [[1968 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] where UCLA, with a healthy Alcindor, defeated Houston 101–69 in the semi-finals en route to the national championship. UCLA limited Hayes, who was averaging 37.7 points per game, to only ten points. Wooden credited his assistant, [[Jerry Norman (basketball)|Jerry Norman]], for devising the diamond-and-one defense that contained Hayes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Esper|first=Dwain|title=Bruins Hope Norman Stays|date=March 25, 1968|newspaper=The Independent|location=Pasadena, California|page=15|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2860094/|via=Newspapers.com|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gasaway |first=John |title=John Wooden's Century |date=June 7, 2010 |work=Basketball Prospectus |url=http://basketballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=798 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aDk35Jn0?url=http://basketballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=798 |archivedate=July 22, 2015 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

===Milwaukee Bucks (1969–1974)===
[[File:Wes Unseld and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.jpeg|thumb|180px|Alcindor displaying his trademark sky-hook over [[Wes Unseld]] of the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963–73)|Baltimore Bullets]]]]
The [[Harlem Globetrotters]] offered Alcindor $1 million to play for them, but he declined and was picked first in the [[1969 NBA draft]] by the [[1969–70 Milwaukee Bucks season|Milwaukee Bucks]], who were in only their second season of existence. The Bucks won a coin-toss with the [[1969–70 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] for first pick. He was also chosen first overall in the 1969 [[American Basketball Association]] draft by the [[1969–70 New York Nets season|New York Nets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=NYN&amp;lg=A&amp;yr=1969 |title=New York Nets (1968 - 1975) 1969 Stats, History, Awards and More |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082053/http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=NYN&amp;lg=A&amp;yr=1969 |archivedate=May 18, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nets believed that they had the upper hand in securing Alcindor's services because he was from New York; however, when Alcindor told both the Bucks and the Nets that he would accept one offer only from each team, the Nets bid too low. Sam Gilbert negotiated the contract along with Los Angeles businessman Ralph Shapiro at no charge.&lt;ref name="SAMCAGERS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082281/2/index.htm Scorecard]. Sports Illustrated, April 7, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; After Alcindor chose the Milwaukee Bucks' offer of $1.4 million, the Nets offered a guaranteed $3.25 million. Alcindor declined the offer, saying, "A bidding war degrades the people involved. It would make me feel like a flesh peddler, and I don't want to think like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alcindor Rejects A.B.A.'s $3.2-Million Offer and Will Sign With Bucks |work=New York Times |date=March 30, 1969 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07EEDE1E39E63ABC4850DFB5668382679EDE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcindor's presence enabled the [[1969–70 Milwaukee Bucks season|1969–70 Bucks]] to claim second place in the NBA's Eastern Division with a 56–26 record (improved from 27–55 the previous year). Alcindor was an instant star, ranking second in the league in scoring ([[List of National Basketball Association top rookie scoring averages|28.8 ppg]]) and third in rebounding ([[List of National Basketball Association top rookie rebounding averages|14.5 rpg]]), for which he was awarded the title of [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|NBA Rookie of the Year]].&lt;ref name="greatath"/&gt; Until [[Jayson Tatum]] in 2018, Alcindor would be the only rookie to record 10 or more games of 20+ points scored during the playoffs.

The next season, the Bucks acquired All-Star guard [[Oscar Robertson]]. Milwaukee went on to record the [[List of NBA teams by single season win percentage|best record in the league]] with 66 victories in the [[1970–71 NBA season|1970–71 season]], including a then-record [[List of National Basketball Association longest winning streaks|20 straight wins]]. Alcindor was awarded his first of six [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]]s, along with his first scoring title (31.7 ppg).&lt;ref name="greatath"/&gt; He also led the league in total points, with 2,596.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; In the playoffs, the Bucks went 12–2 (including a four-game sweep of the [[1970–71 Baltimore Bullets season|Baltimore Bullets]] in the [[NBA Finals]]), and won the championship, while Alcindor was named [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP]]. On May 1, 1971, the day after the Bucks won the NBA championship, he adopted the Muslim name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ({{lang-ar|كريم عبد الجبار}}, ''Karīm Abd al-Jabbār''), its translation roughly "generous/noble (Kareem), servant of (Abdul) the mighty/stern one (Jabbar) [i.e., of [[Allah|God]]]". He had converted to Islam while at UCLA.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

[[File:Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 1974.jpeg|thumb|175px|left|Abdul-Jabbar lines up a free-throw. He started wearing goggles in order to avoid damage to his corneas.]]
Abdul-Jabbar remained a dominant force for the Bucks. The following year, he repeated as scoring champion with ([[List of National Basketball Association top individual scoring season averages|34.8 ppg]] and 2,822 total points)&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; and was named NBA Most Valuable Player. He helped the Bucks to repeat as division leaders for four straight years. In 1974, Abdul-Jabbar won his third MVP Award in five years and was among the top five NBA players in scoring (27.0 ppg, third), rebounding ([[List of National Basketball Association top rookie rebounding averages|14.5 rpg]], fourth), blocked shots (283, second), and field goal percentage (.539, second).

Abdul-Jabbar remained relatively injury-free throughout his NBA career, but he twice broke one of his hands. The first incident occurred during a pre-season game in 1974, when he was bumped hard and got his eye scratched; this angered him enough to punch the basket support [[Wiktionary:stanchion|stanchion]]. He returned after missing the first 16 games of the season and started to wear protective goggles. In the second incident, he broke his hand during the opening game of the [[1977–78 NBA season|1977–78 season]]. Two minutes into the game, Abdul-Jabbar punched [[1977–78 Milwaukee Bucks season|Milwaukee]]'s [[Kent Benson]] in retaliation for an overly aggressive elbow; the punch caused Benson's jaw to be broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sachare|first=Alex|title=Kareem kayos Kent Benson|work=The Prescott Courier|agency=Associated Press|date=October 19, 1977|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1xoLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HVADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6141,2774587&amp;dq=kent+benson&amp;hl=en|accessdate=March 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the injury to his hand, Abdul-Jabbar was out for two months, and it was unnecessary for the NBA to suspend him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmons|first=Bill|title=The Book of Basketball: The NBA According to the Sports Guy|publisher=ESPN Books|year=2009|location=New York City|page=133|isbn=978-0-345-51176-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Abdul-Jabbar always spoke well of [[Milwaukee]] and its fans, he said that being in the Midwest did not fit his cultural needs. In October 1974, he requested a trade to either the New York Knicks or [[1974–75 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=CNNSI.com| title=Say It Ain't So Milwaukee Bucks| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/news/2001/05/30/sayitaintso_bucks/| date=May 30, 2001| accessdate=June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-25/sports/sp-21142_1_national-basketball-assn|title=JUNE 16, 1975: A BANNER DAY FOR LAKERS : KAREEM TAKES HIS POST : 4 Players Bucks Got in Trade Gone, but He's Still on Job|first=THOMAS|last=BONK|date=December 25, 1987|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Angeles Lakers (1975–1989)===
In 1975, the Lakers acquired Abdul-Jabbar and reserve center [[Walt Wesley]] from the Bucks for center [[Elmore Smith]], guard [[Brian Winters]], and rookie "blue chippers" [[David Meyers (basketball)|Dave Meyers]] and [[Junior Bridgeman]]. In the [[1975–76 NBA season|1975–76 season]], his first with the Lakers, he had a dominating season, averaging 27.7 points per game and leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played. His 1,111 defensive rebounds remains the NBA single-season record (defensive rebounds were not recorded prior to the [[1973–74 NBA season|1973–74 season]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bleacherreport.com/articles/435333-the-20-most-complete-players-in-the-nba-history |title= NBA Power Rankings: The 20 Most Complete Players In NBA History |work= Bleacher Report |date=August 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his fourth MVP award, but missed the post-season for the second straight year.

[[File:Kareem Magic Lipofsky.jpg|left|thumb|Abdul-Jabbar (33) receiving a pass from [[Magic Johnson]]]]
Once he joined the Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar began wearing his trademark goggles (he briefly ditched them in the [[1979–80 NBA season|1979–80 season]]). Years of battling under NBA backboards, and being hit and scratched in the face in the process, had taken their toll on his eyes and he developed [[Recurrent corneal erosion|corneal erosion syndrome]], where the eyes begin to dry out easily and cease to produce moisture. He missed one game in the [[1986–87 NBA season|1986–87 season]] when his eyes dried out and swelled.

In the [[1976–77 NBA season|1976–77 season]], Abdul-Jabbar had another strong performance. He led the league in field goal percentage, finished second in rebounds and blocked shots, and third in points per game. He helped lead the Lakers to the best record in the NBA, and he won his record-tying fifth MVP award. In the playoffs, the Lakers beat the [[1976–77 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]] in the Western Conference semi-finals, setting up a confrontation with the [[1976–77 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]]. The result was a memorable matchup, pitting Abdul-Jabbar against a young, injury-free [[Bill Walton]]. Although Abdul-Jabbar dominated the series statistically, Walton and the Trail Blazers (who were experiencing their first-ever run in the playoffs) swept the Lakers, behind Walton's skillful passing and leadership.

Abdul-Jabbar's play remained strong during the next two seasons, being named to the All-NBA Second Team twice, the All-Defense First Team once, and the All-Defense Second Team once. The Lakers, however, continued to be stymied in the playoffs, being eliminated by the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in both [[1977–78 NBA season|1978]] and [[1978–79 NBA season|1979]].

In 1979, the Lakers acquired first overall draft pick [[Magic Johnson]]. The trade and draft paved the way for a Laker dynasty as they went on to become one of the most dominant teams of the 1980s, appearing in the finals eight times and winning five NBA championships. Individually, while Abdul-Jabbar was not the dominant center he had been in the 1970s, he experienced a number of highlight moments. Among them were his record sixth MVP award in 1980, four more All-NBA First Team designations, two more All-Defense First Team designations, the 1985 Finals MVP, and on April 5, 1984 breaking Wilt Chamberlain's record for most career points. Later in his career, he bulked up to about {{convert|265|lb|kg}}, to be able to withstand the strain of playing the highly physical center position into his early 40s.

While in Los Angeles, Abdul-Jabbar started doing [[yoga]] in 1976 to improve his flexibility, and was notable for his physical fitness regimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogaexpo.com/press/press27.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 23, 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031206101425/http://www.yogaexpo.com/press/press27.htm |archivedate=December 6, 2003 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He says, "There is no way I could have played as long as I did without yoga."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=sports and yoga Posted by: dionne on 10-Jan-11 |url=http://www.bikramyogavernon.com/2011/01/10/sports-yoga/ |title=Kareem Abdul-Jabbar does Bikram Yoga |publisher=Bikramyogavernon.com |date=January 13, 2011 |accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Abdul-Jabbar's house burned down. Many of his belongings, including his beloved [[Jazz music|jazz]] LP collection of about 3,000 albums, were destroyed.&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite news|title=NBA Notes: Kareem loses a lot|date=February 11, 1983|first=Ron|last=Thomas|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|page=5C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Lakers fans sent and brought him albums, which he found uplifting.&lt;ref name="lakersblog.latimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://lakersblog.latimes.com/lakersblog/2006/01/talking_with_ka_1.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Talking with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Part I | date=January 25, 2006 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 1989, Abdul-Jabbar was 42 years old when announced that he would retire at the end of the season after twenty years in the NBA. On his "retirement tour" he received standing ovations at games, home and away and gifts ranging from a yacht that said "Captain Skyhook" to framed jerseys from his basketball career to an Afghan rug. In his biography ''My Life'', [[Magic Johnson]] recalls that many Lakers and Celtics legends participated in Abdul-Jabbar's farewell game. Every player wore Abdul-Jabbar's trademark goggles and had to try a skyhook at least once, which led to comic results. The Lakers made the NBA Finals in each of Abdul-Jabbar's final three seasons, defeating [[1986–87 Boston Celtics season|Boston]] in 1987, and [[1987–88 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit]] in 1988. The Lakers lost to the Pistons in a four-game sweep in his final season.

At the time of his retirement, Abdul-Jabbar held the record for most games played by a single player in the NBA; this would later be broken by [[Robert Parish]]. He also was the all-time record holder for most points (38,387), most field goals made (15,837), and most minutes played (57,446).&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

===Post-NBA career===
[[File:KareemAbdulJabbarSept2011.jpg|thumb|180px|Abdul-Jabbar in September 2011]]
Since 2005, Abdul-Jabbar has served as a special assistant coach for the Lakers. He had been interested in coaching since his retirement, and given the influence that he exerted on the league during his playing days, he thought that the opportunity would present itself. However, during his playing years, Abdul-Jabbar had developed a reputation for being introverted and sullen. He did not speak to the press, which led to the impression that he disliked journalists. In his biography ''My Life'', [[Magic Johnson]] recalls instances when Abdul-Jabbar brushed him off when he was a [[ball boy]] and asked him for an autograph. Abdul-Jabbar also froze out reporters who gave him a too-enthusiastic handshake or even hugged him, and he refused to stop reading the newspaper while giving an interview.

Many basketball observers,{{who|date=October 2014}} in addition to Abdul-Jabbar himself, believe that his reticence, whether through disdain for the press or simply because of introversion, contributed to the dearth of coaching opportunities offered to Abdul-Jabbar by the NBA. In his words, he said he had a mindset he could not overcome, and proceeded through his career oblivious to the effect his reticence may have had on his future coaching prospects. Abdul-Jabbar said: "I didn't understand that I also had affected people that way and that's what it was all about. I always saw it like they were trying to pry. I was way too suspicious and I paid a price for it."&lt;ref name="lakersblog.latimes.com"/&gt; Since he began lobbying for a coaching position in 1995, he has managed to obtain only low-level assistant and scouting jobs in the NBA, and a head coaching position only in a minor professional league.

Abdul-Jabbar has worked as an assistant for the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] and the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], helping mentor, among others, their young centers, [[Michael Olowokandi]] and [[Jerome James]]. Abdul-Jabbar was the head coach of the [[Oklahoma Storm]] of the [[United States Basketball League]] in 2002, leading the team to the league's championship that season, but he failed to land the head coaching position at [[Columbia University]] a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Columbia College Today |author=Jonathan Lemire |title=Keeping Up |url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/jan04/features5.php |date=January 2004 |accessdate=June 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610070044/http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/jan04/features5.php |archivedate=June 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a [[scout (sport)|scout]] for the [[New York Knicks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Esquire: Q + A: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar| author=Doug Cantor| url=http://www.mywire.com/pubs/Esquire/2004/06/01/463658?extID=10037&amp;oliID=229| date=June 1, 2004| accessdate=June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on September 2, 2005, he returned to the Lakers as a special assistant to [[Phil Jackson]] to help the Lakers' centers, and in particular their young draftee [[Andrew Bynum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=LAKERS: Lakers hire Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as Special Assistant Coach| publisher=NBA.com| url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/abdul-jabbar.050902.html| date=September 2, 2005| accessdate=June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdul-Jabbar's influence has been credited with Bynum's emergence as a more talented NBA center. Abdul-Jabbar also served as a volunteer coach at Alchesay High School on the [[Fort Apache Indian Reservation]] in [[Whiteriver, Arizona]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Volunteers As High School Coach On Indian Reservation in Arizona |publisher=Jet |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_1998_Nov_23/ai_53365359 |date=November 23, 1998 |accessdate=June 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184401/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_1998_Nov_23/ai_53365359 |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, he performed a tribute to friend [[Muhammad Ali]] along with [[Chance the Rapper]].&lt;ref name="Special Award Presenters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designntrend.com/articles/80585/20160712/2016-espy-awards-air-date-time-where-watch-live-stream-presenters-nominees-info-poll.htm/ |title=2016 Espy Award Nominees |last=Williams |first=Janice |date=July 12, 2016 |access-date=July 15, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715074451/http://www.designntrend.com/articles/80585/20160712/2016-espy-awards-air-date-time-where-watch-live-stream-presenters-nominees-info-poll.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also co-author of a comic book published by [[Titan Comics]] entitled ''Mycroft Holmes and the Apocalypse Handbook''.

==Player profile==
On offense, Abdul-Jabbar was an unstoppable low-post threat. In contrast to other low-post dominators like [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Artis Gilmore]] or [[Shaquille O'Neal]], Abdul-Jabbar was a relatively slender player, standing {{height|ft=7|in=2}} tall but only weighing {{convert|225|lb|kg|abbr=on}} (though in his latter years the Lakers listed Abdul-Jabbar's weight as {{convert|265|lb|kg}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.espn.co.uk/nba/playoffs/2009/news/story?id=4249626 |title= Kareem calls out Howard for play |work= ESPN |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he made up for his relative lack of bulk by showing textbook finesse, strength and was famous for his ambidextrous [[hook shot|skyhook]] shot, which was impossible for defenders to block. It contributed to his high .559 field goal accuracy, making him the eighth most accurate scorer of all time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/FGP_career.html|title=NBA &amp; ABA Career Leaders and Records for Field Goal Pct - Basketball-Reference.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a feared clutch shooter. Abdul-Jabbar was also quick enough to run the [[Showtime (basketball)|Showtime]] fast break led by [[Magic Johnson]] and was well-conditioned, standing on the hardwood an average 36.8 minutes. In contrast to other big men, Abdul-Jabbar also could reasonably hit his free throws, finishing with a career 72% average.

[[File:Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar Lipofsky.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Abdul-Jabbar displaying his trademark sky-hook against the [[Boston Celtics]] in the late 1980s, shortly before his retirement.]]
Abdul-Jabbar maintained a dominant presence on defense. He was selected to the NBA All-Defensive Team eleven times. He frustrated opponents with his superior shot-blocking ability and denied an average of 2.6 shots a game. After the pounding he endured early in his career, his rebounding average fell to between six or eight a game in his latter years.&lt;ref name=nba_encyc_bio/&gt;

As a teammate, Abdul-Jabbar exuded natural leadership and was affectionately called "Cap"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ps5bFjaB5PsC&amp;pg=PA30 | page = 30 | title = The Great Book of Los Angeles Sports Lists | first = Steve | last = Hartman | first2 = Matt | last2 = Smith | publisher=Basic Civitas Books | year = 2009 | isbn = 0-7624-3520-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Captain" by his colleagues. He had an even temperament, which Riley said made him coachable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Roy S. |title=THE LONG-RUN SUCCESS OF KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR |date=May 22, 1983 |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/sports/the-long-run-success-of-kareem-abdul-jabbar.html?pagewanted=all |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6d4cMk6Sb?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/sports/the-long-run-success-of-kareem-abdul-jabbar.html?pagewanted=all |archivedate=November 16, 2015 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strict fitness regime made him one of the most durable players of all time. In the NBA, his 20 seasons and 1,560 games are performances surpassed only by former Celtics' center [[Robert Parish]].

===Skyhook===
Abdul-Jabbar was well known for his trademark "skyhook", a [[hook shot]] in which he bent his entire body (rather than just the arm) like a straw in one fluid motion to raise the ball and then release it at the highest point of his arm's arching motion. Combined with his long arms and great height—{{height|ft=7|in=2}}—the skyhook was difficult for a defender to block without committing a [[goaltending]] violation. It was a reliable and feared offensive weapon and contributed to his high lifetime field goal percentage of 0.559. He was adept at shooting the skyhook with either hand, which made him even more difficult to defend against, though as a right-handed player, he was stronger shooting the skyhook with his right hand than he was with his left. According to Abdul-Jabbar, he learned the move in fifth grade after practicing with the [[Mikan Drill]] and soon learned to value it, as it was "the only shot I could use that didn't get smashed back in my face".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://lakersblog.latimes.com/lakersblog/2006/01/talking_with_ka_2.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Talking with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Part II | date=January 27, 2006 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Abdul-Jabbar is the NBA's all-time leading scorer with 38,387 points and won a league-record six MVP awards.&lt;ref name=nba_encyc_bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=espn_no2&gt;{{cite news|title=All-Time #NBArank: Kareem No. 2 |date=February 10, 2016 |website=ESPN.com |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarank2/all-nbarank-2 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fEcI6Ujn?url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarank2/all-nbarank-2 |archivedate=February 12, 2016 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned six championship rings, two Finals MVP awards, fifteen NBA First or Second Teams, a record nineteen NBA All-Star call-ups and averaging 24.6 points, 11.2 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 2.6 blocks per game.&lt;ref name="greatath"/&gt; He is ranked as the NBA's third leading all-time rebounder (17,440).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/history/leaders/_/stat/rebounds |title=NBA History – Rebounds Leaders |publisher=espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the third all-time in registered blocks (3,189),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/statistics/default_all_time_leaders/AllTimeLeadersBLKQuery.html |title=All Time Leaders: Blocks |publisher=nba.com |date= |accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is even more impressive because this stat had not been recorded until the fourth year of his career (1974).

Abdul-Jabbar combined dominance during his career peak with the longevity and sustained excellence of his later years.&lt;ref name=espn_no2/&gt; After claiming his sixth and final MVP in 1980, he continued to average above 20 points in the following six seasons,&lt;ref name=nba_encyc_bio/&gt; including 23 points per game in his 17th season at age 38.&lt;ref name=espn_greatest_center/&gt; He made the NBA's [[NBA 35th Anniversary Team|35th Anniversary Team]], and was named one of its [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History|50 greatest players of all time]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="greatath"/&gt; Abdul-Jabbar is regarded as one of the best centers ever,&lt;ref name="The Game's Greatest Giants Ever"/&gt; and league experts and basketball legends frequently mentioned him when considering the greatest player of all time.&lt;ref name=espn_greatest_center&gt;{{cite news|title=All-time #NBArank: Counting down the 10 greatest centers ever |date=January 19, 2016 |website=ESPN.com |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarankCs/ranking-greatest-centers-nba-history |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6efUGARwm?url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarankCs/ranking-greatest-centers-nba-history |archivedate=January 20, 2016 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Lakers coach [[Pat Riley]] once said, "Why judge anymore? When a man has broken records, won championships, endured tremendous criticism and responsibility, why judge? Let's toast him as the greatest player ever."&lt;ref name=nba_encyc_bio/&gt; [[Isiah Thomas]] remarked, "If they say the numbers don't lie, then Kareem is the greatest ever to play the game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-23/sports/ct-spt-0324-mitchell--20120324_1_kareem-abdul-jabbar-greatest-scorer-lebron-james|title=NBA's best all-time?

He's the guy you gotta start your franchise with."&lt;ref name="Julius Erving interview"/&gt; In 2015, [[ESPN]] named Abdul-Jabbar the best center in NBA history,&lt;ref name=espn_greatest_center/&gt; and ranked him No. 2 behind [[Michael Jordan]] among the greatest NBA players ever.&lt;ref name=espn_no2/&gt; While Jordan's shots were enthralling and considered unfathomable, Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook appeared automatic, and he himself called the shot "unsexy".&lt;ref name=nba_encyc_bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=espn_no2/&gt;

==Film and television==
[[File:Kareem and I.jpg|thumb|180px|Actor [[Shavar Ross]] and Abdul-Jabbar on the set of ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'', circa 1982]]
Playing in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] facilitated Abdul-Jabbar's trying his hand at acting.
He made his film debut in [[Bruce Lee]]'s 1972 film ''[[Game of Death]]'', in which his character Hakim fights Billy Lo (played by Lee).

In 1980, he played co-pilot Roger Murdock in ''[[Airplane!]]''.&lt;ref name="greatath"/&gt; Abdul-Jabbar has a scene in which a little boy looks at him and remarks that he is in fact Abdul-Jabbar—spoofing the appearance of football star [[Elroy Hirsch|Elroy "Crazylegs" Hirsch]] as an airplane pilot in the 1957 drama that served as the inspiration for ''Airplane!'', ''[[Zero Hour!]]''. Staying in character, Abdul-Jabbar states that he is merely Roger Murdock, an airline co-pilot, but the boy continues to insist that Abdul-Jabbar is "the greatest", but that, according to his father, he doesn't "work hard on defense" and "never really tries, except during the playoffs". This causes Abdul-Jabbar's character to snap, "The hell I don't!", then grab the boy and snarl he has "[heard] that crap ever since ... [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]", he "busts his buns every night" and the boy should tell his "old man to drag [[Bill Walton|[Bill] Walton]] and [[Bob Lanier (basketball)|[Bob] Lanier]] up and down the court for 48 minutes". When Murdock loses consciousness later in the film, he collapses at the controls wearing Abdul-Jabbar's goggles and yellow Lakers' shorts.

==Writing and activism==
[[File:Kareem1vl1.jpg|left|thumb|Abdul-Jabbar at a book signing.]]
Abdul-Jabbar is also a best-selling author and cultural critic. His first book, his autobiography ''[[Giant Steps (book)|Giant Steps]]'', was written in 1983 with co-author [[Peter Knobler]]. (The book's title is an homage to jazz great [[John Coltrane]], referring to his album ''[[Giant Steps]]''.) Others include ''On the Shoulders of Giants: My Journey Through the Harlem Renaissance'', co-written with [[Raymond Obstfeld]], and ''Brothers in Arms: The Epic Story of the [[761st Tank Battalion (United States)|761st Tank Battalion]], World War II's Forgotten Heroes'', co-written with [[Anthony Walton (poet)|Anthony Walton]], which is a history of an all-black armored unit that served with distinction in Europe.

Abdul-Jabbar has also been a regular contributor to discussions about issues of race and religion, among other topics, in national magazines and on television. He has written a regular column for [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']], for example, and he appeared on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' on Sunday, January 25, 2015, to talk about a recent column, which pointed out that Islam should not be blamed for the actions of violent extremists, just as Christianity has not been blamed for the actions of violent extremists who profess Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3662152/kareem-abdul-jabbar-paris-charlie-hebdo-terrorist-attacks-are-not-about-religion/ |title=These Terrorist Attacks Are Not About Religion |work=Time |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/middle-east-unrest/kareem-abdul-jabbar-meet-press-islam-religion-peace-n293201 |title=Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on Meet the Press |publisher=nbc.com |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about being Muslim, he said: "I don't have any misgiving about my faith. I'm very concerned about the people who claim to be Muslims that are murdering people and creating all this mayhem in the world. That is not what Islam is about, and that should not be what people think of when they think about Muslims. But it's up to all of us to do something about all of it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2015/11/01/453739566/kareem-abdul-jabbar-if-its-time-to-speak-up-you-have-to-speak-up "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: 'If It's Time To Speak Up, You Have To Speak Up'"], [[NPR]] interview with [[Michel Martin]], November 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Abdul-Jabbar published an essay in [[Jacobin (magazine)|''Jacobin'']] magazine calling for just compensation for [[College athletics in the United States|college athletes]], writing, "in the name of fairness, we must bring an end to the indentured servitude of college athletes and start paying them what they are worth."&lt;ref name="jacobin"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/11/college-athletes-of-the-world-unite/ |title=College Athletes of the World, Unite |last=Abdul-Jabbar |first=Kareem |journal=Jacobin |date=November 12, 2014 |accessdate=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Abdul-Jabbar participated in the national UCLA alumni commercial entitled "My Big UCLA Moment". The UCLA commercial is featured on YouTube.

On February 10, 2011, Abdul-Jabbar debuted his film ''On the Shoulders of Giants'', documenting the tumultuous journey of the famed yet often-overlooked Harlem Renaissance professional basketball team, at [[Science Park High School (New Jersey)|Science Park High School]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. The event was simulcasted live throughout the school, city, and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=New Jersey Star Ledger| title=Kareem Abdul-Jabbar tells Newark students a tale worth learning| url=http://www.nj.com/sports/index.ssf/2011/02/dalessandro_kareem_abdul-jabba.html| date=February 11, 2011| accessdate=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentating on Donald Trump's 2017 travel ban, he strongly condemned it, saying: "the absence of reason and compassion is the very definition of pure evil because it is a rejection of our sacred values, distilled from millennia of struggle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsmax.com/US/muslim-ban-kareem-abdul-jabbar-nba/2017/01/30/id/771147/ |title=Kareem Abdul-Jabbar denounces Donald Trump's ban on Muslim countries |last=Devaney |first=Jason |date=January 30, 2017 |website=[[Newsmax.com]] |access-date=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Basketball Legends.jpg|thumb|210px|left|Abdul-Jabbar (below, far right) and other former NBA players visit the New York [[NBA Store]] in January 2005]]
Abdul-Jabbar met Habiba Abdul-Jabbar (born Janice Brown) at a Lakers game during his senior year at UCLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abdul-Jabbar|first=Kareem|title=Giant Steps|year=1983|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0-553-05044-3|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually married and together had three children: daughters Habiba and Sultana and son Kareem Jr, who played basketball at [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]] after attending junior college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kareemabduljabbar.com/?m=200803 |title=The Official Website of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar " 2008 " March |publisher=Kareemabduljabbar.com |date= |accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdul-Jabbar and Janice divorced in 1978. He has another son, Amir, with Cheryl Pistono. Another son, Adam, made an appearance on the TV sitcom ''Full House'' with him.

===Religion and name===
At age 24 in 1971, he converted to Islam and became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, which means “the noble one, servant of the Almighty.”&lt;ref name="Jabbar2015"/&gt; He was named by [[Hamaas Abdul Khaalis]].&lt;ref name="Jabbar2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abdul-Jabbar|first1=Kareen|title=Why I converted to Islam|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/3/why-i-converted-to-islam.html|website=aljazeera|accessdate=March 14, 2014|date=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdul-Jabbar purchased and donated [[7700 16th Street NW]], a house in Washington, D.C., for Khaalis to use as the Hanafi Madh-Hab Center. Eventually, Kareem "found that [he] disagreed with some of Hamaas’ teachings about the Quran, and [they] parted ways."&lt;ref name="Jabbar2015"/&gt;

Abdul-Jabbar has spoken about the thinking that was behind his name change when he converted to Islam. He stated that he was "latching on to something that was part of my heritage, because many of the slaves who were brought here were Muslims. My family was brought to America by a French planter named Alcindor, who came here from [[Trinidad]] in the 18th century. My people were [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], and their culture survived [[slavery]]...&amp;nbsp; My father found out about that when I was a kid, and it gave me all I needed to know that, hey, I was somebody, even if nobody else knew about it. When I was a kid, no one would believe anything positive that you could say about black people. And that's a terrible burden on black people, because they don't have an accurate idea of their history, which has been either suppressed or distorted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ps1.sportsline.com/b/member/playboy/8606_b11.html Sportsline]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Abdul-Jabbar reached a settlement after he sued [[Miami Dolphins]] running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/30/sports/plus-sports-marketing-abdul-jabbars-settle-their-suit.html Abdul-Jabbars Settle Their Suit], New York ''Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; (now [[Abdul-Karim al-Jabbar]], born Sharmon Shah) because he felt Karim was sponging off the name he made famous by having the Abdul-Jabbar moniker and number 33 on his Dolphins jersey. As a result, the younger Abdul-Jabbar had to change his jersey nameplate to simply "Abdul" while playing for the Dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n2_v93/ai_20048711 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 16, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312130135/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n2_v93/ai_20048711 |archivedate=March 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The football player had also been an athlete at UCLA.

===Health problems===
Abdul-Jabbar suffers from [[migraine]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9506E7DD143BF93BA15756C0A962948260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fA%2fAbdul%2dJabbar%2c%20Kareem | work=The New York Times | title=Transferring A Headache | first=Dave | last=Anderson | date=May 28, 1984 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his use of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to reduce the symptoms has had legal ramifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/841057.stm |work=BBC News | title=Abdul-Jabbar in drug arrest | date=July 19, 2000 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, Abdul-Jabbar announced that he was suffering from a form of [[leukemia]], [[Philadelphia chromosome]]-positive [[chronic myeloid leukemia]], a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The disease was diagnosed in December 2008, but Abdul-Jabbar said his condition could be managed by taking oral medication daily, seeing his specialist every other month and having his blood analyzed regularly. He expressed in a 2009 press conference that he did not believe that the illness would stop him from leading a normal life.

"You're never really cancer-free and I should have known that", Abdul-Jabbar said. "My cancer right now is at an absolute minimum".&lt;ref name=kaj_health_update/&gt;

In April 2015, Abdul-Jabbar was admitted to hospital when he was diagnosed with [[cardiovascular disease]].

{{Chinese name|[[Liu (surname)|Liu]]}}

'''Liu Geping''' ({{zh|s=刘格平}}; 8 August 1904{{snd}}11{{nbsp}}March 1992) was a Chinese communist revolutionary and politician of [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslim heritage. He is best known as the founding Chairman of the [[Ningxia]] Hui Autonomous Region and later for seizing power in Shanxi during the [[Cultural Revolution]], where he made himself the top leader of the province. 

Liu spent his early days as a communist agitator, leading peasant uprisings and building the party organization in rural areas. A political survivor, he was arrested several times during the [[Warlord Era]] and served two prison terms. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he held important roles in the party and government but was branded a traitor in 1960.  He later returned to work, only to be purged again several years later during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. He was rehabilitated after the Cultural Revolution and spent the rest of his life in ceremonial positions.

==Republic of China==
===Warlord Era===
Liu Geping was born on 8 August 1904 into a large landowning family of Muslim [[Hui people|Hui ethnicity]] in Dadi East Village ({{zh|s=大堤东村|labels=no}}), [[Mengcun County]], [[Hebei]] Province. He also used the names Liu Zimin ({{zh|s=刘子敏|labels=no}}) and Liu Xiangnong ({{zh|s=刘襄侬|labels=no}}). In 1918 he joined the army of [[Li Chun (warlord)|Li Chun]], a warlord of the [[Zhili Clique]], and entered its military school in [[Nanjing]]. The next year he participated in the [[May Fourth Movement]] as an activist. He joined the [[Chinese Socialist Youth League]] in 1922, and returned home to spread revolutionary values. Instrumental in the founding of the first socialist youth cell in the area, in December 1925 he co-led an armed peasant uprising against the [[Beiyang government]], the first of its kind in northern China.&lt;ref name=dezhou&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dezhoudaily.com/2011zt/jd90zn/dzds/201107/2011-07-01254645.html |script-title=zh:刘格平: 马颊河大罢工的领导者 |date=2011-07-01 |newspaper=Dezhou Daily |language=Chinese }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=qingyun&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qingyun.dzszb.com/index.aspx?lanmuid=75&amp;sublanmuid=672&amp;id=661 |script-title=zh:刘格平 |trans-title=Liu Geping |date=2014-06-26 |work=Qingyun County Gazette |language=Chinese }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Need source: However, due to poor training and lack of good weapons, the uprising failed. Liu then fled to Tianjin wearing a disguise to avoid pursuit by the authorities. By the winter of 1925 he had established himself in Tianjin as the head of a labour agitation group, again preparing for armed uprising. --&gt;

In July 1926, Liu joined the [[Communist Party of China]] and then spearheaded a series of educational initiatives aimed at increasing the influence of the party in the [[Tianjin]]-Hebei region. After founding schools and party organizations in dozens of counties, he took part in the founding of a 300-strong "Southern Tianjin Revolutionary Army", which aimed to topple warlords and incite armed uprisings. In June 1928 he led a peasant uprising in [[Qingyun County]], occupying the county seat and taking guns from the local police. He was arrested that year for his agitation and spent the next three years in prison. After he was released, the Communist Party sent him to [[Shaanxi]] to work for [[Yang Hucheng]]'s army.&lt;ref name=dezhou/&gt;&lt;ref name=qingyun/&gt;&lt;ref name=nccu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cped.nccu.edu.tw/node/1142429 |script-title=zh:劉格平 |trans-title=Liu Geping |publisher=[[National Chengchi University]] |language=Chinese |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese invasion and Civil War===
After the [[Mukden incident]] and subsequent Japanese incursions into China, Liu became a founding member of the "Hui People Against Japanese Invasion" organization. In 1932 he returned home to work on military operations and to coordinate underground party activities. He was again arrested on April{{nbsp}}20, 1934, after organizing the Majia River ({{zh|s=马颊河|labels=no}}) uprising in Qingyun.&lt;ref name=dezhou/&gt;&lt;ref name=qingyun/&gt; &lt;!-- Needs source: He resisted arrest and was shot in his left hand, with one of his fingers severed off of his hand and two others fractured. --&gt; He was held in Caolanzi Prison ({{zh|s=草岚子监狱|labels=no}}) in Beijing,&lt;ref name=qingyun/&gt; along with 61 other Communist Party leaders including [[Bo Yibo]], [[An Ziwen]], and [[Liu Lantao]] (no relation). To secure their release, the Communist Party Central Committee advised them to  sign an announcement denouncing communism. Most complied and were released by the [[Kuomintang]] government, but Liu Geping was among the few who refused and served his full sentence.{{sfn|Guo|Song|Zhou|2009|p=158}}

After his release in 1944, Liu took on more leadership roles within the Tianjin branch of the Communist Party. He then went to [[Shandong]] to found an organization for ethnic Hui to aid soldiers on the front lines of the [[Chinese Civil War]].&lt;ref name=dezhou/&gt;&lt;ref name=qingyun/&gt;&lt;ref name=nccu/&gt; In March 1949, he went south with the [[People's Liberation Army]] to [[East China]] and served as vice-principal of the newly established East China People's Revolution University.&lt;ref name=qingyun/&gt;&lt;ref name=nccu/&gt;

==People's Republic of China==
===Early PRC===
In September 1949, Liu Geping was selected as an ethnic minority representative to attend the first meeting of the Communist-led [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]]; he was ranked first among minority delegates.&lt;ref name=qingyun/&gt; At the founding ceremony of the [[People's Republic of China]] on 1 October 1949, he was selected to speak in [[Tiananmen Square]] as the official representative of China's minority peoples.{{sfn|MacFarquhar|Schoenhals|2009|p=171}}

Liu joined the government and became deputy director of the [[State Ethnic Affairs Commission]]. In this capacity Liu frequently visited western areas with high minority populations. He was a delegate to the 1st [[National People's Congress]] in 1954.&lt;ref name=qingyun/&gt; After the congress, Liu and the Tibetan communist [[Phünwang]] were assigned to accompany the [[14th Dalai Lama]], also a delegate, on his tour of Chinese cities, which had a great impact on the Dalai Lama.{{sfn|Goldstein|2007|p=503}}

In 1956, Liu was elected a member of the [[8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]]. In 1958, Liu began heading up the party organization of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on an interim basis. He became the first Chairman of the autonomous region government in October 1958.&lt;ref name=qingyun/&gt; Because he took a moderate approach to policies toward ethnic minorities, he was branded an "ethnic splittist" in 1960.{{sfn|Guo|Song|Zhou|2009|p=158}} In September he was dismissed from all of his positions and sent back to Beijing to take part in "rehabilitation" at the [[Central Party School]].&lt;ref name=qingyun/&gt;

===Cultural Revolution===
In December 1965, Liu regained favour and was named Vice-Governor of [[Shanxi]] province.&lt;ref name=nccu/&gt; At the beginning of the [[Cultural Revolution]], having gained the support of leftist radicals in Beijing, Liu successfully overthrew his superior [[Wei Heng]] and became Chairman of the Shanxi [[revolutionary committee (China)|Revolutionary Committee]], the ''de facto'' top leader. Wei was imprisoned and committed suicide.{{sfn|MacFarquhar|Schoenhals|2009|p=171}} Meanwhile, the [[Central Cultural Revolution Group]], led by [[Kang Sheng]] and [[Jiang Qing]], began to investigate the case of the 61 communist leaders who were instructed to denounce communism at Caolanzi Prison in the 1930s. The officials, notably Bo Yibo and An Ziwen, were branded as the "[[61 Renegades]] Clique" and persecuted. In contrast, Liu Geping was heralded as a hero for his refusal to sign the denunciation. He was invited to make speeches all over the country and was re-elected to the [[9th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] in April 1969.{{sfn|Guo|Song|Zhou|2009|p=159}} However, Liu had also become involved in major disputes with the military leaders in Shanxi and was engaged in factional violence in the province. He was dismissed from office in July 1969, just three months after his re-election to the Central Committee.{{sfn|Guo|Song|Zhou|2009|p=159}} In 1970, he was sent to perform manual labour at a pottery factory in [[Tangshan]]. He was allowed to return to Beijing in 1975.&lt;ref name=qingyun/&gt;

===Later life===
After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the pivotal [[3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]], the post-Mao Communist Party cleared Liu's name and declared that he "did not have any political problems."&lt;ref name=cangzhou&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.czhzwh.com/E_ReadNews.asp?NewsID=279 |script-title=zh:回族革命先驱刘格平 |trans-title=Hui revolutionary leader Liu Geping |date=2012-02-04 |work=Cangzhou Hui Culture Network |language=Chinese }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983,&lt;ref name=cangzhou/&gt; he was named a member of the National Committee of the 6th [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], a ceremonial position.{{sfn|Guo|Song|Zhou|2009|p=159}}

Liu died in Beijing on 11 March 1992.&lt;ref name=nccu/&gt; He was given full funeral rites at the [[Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery]]. His body was taken back to his native village and buried according to Muslim Hui rituals.&lt;ref name=cangzhou/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2618">'''Menw''', son of Three-Cries ({{lang-wlm|Menw fab Teirgwaedd}}), is a hero and [[shapeshifter]] in early [[Welsh literature]], an "Enchanted Knight" of [[King Arthur]] at his court at [[Celliwig]]. He appears most prominently in the early [[Arthurian mythology|Arthurian]] tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', in which he is handpicked among Arthur's warriors to accompany [[Culhwch]] on his quest to win [[Olwen]]. An "Enchanter Knight" of Arthur's court, he learned one of the Three Enchantments from [[Uther Pendragon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Welsh Triads/Red Book of Hergest#18|''Triads from the Red Book of Hergest'' 18]]&lt;/ref&gt; He is ascribed a son named '''Anynnawg'''.

==Role in Welsh tradition==
After being cursed by his [[stepmother]] so that he marry no one but [[Olwen]], daughter of the giant [[Ysbaddaden]], [[Culhwch|Culhwch ap Cilydd]] seeks assistance from his cousin Arthur to win her hand in marriage. Arthur agrees to help him, sending six of his many warriors to assist him on his [[quest]], with Menw as the sixth. Each warrior has his own unique skill; Menw is a skilled magician, able to place he and his companions under an illusion of invisibility so as to protect them in savage lands.
[[File:Culhwch.jpg|thumb|right|[[Culhwch]] entering Arthur's Court in the Welsh tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', 1881]]
Prior to the [[Hunting of Twrch Trwyth]], Menw is sent in the form of a [[bird]] to spy on [[Twrch Trwyth]] and his piglets, eventually catching up with him at ''Osgair Oerfel'' in Ireland. Menw attempts to retrieve one of the boar's trinkets but is poisoned in the process and was thereafter never completely without injury. He also plays a part in the hunt proper, chasing the boar into the [[Severn]] alongside [[Mabon ap Modron]] and [[Goreu fab Custennin]].

Later Menw appears in the tale ''[[Breuddwyd Rhonabwy]]'' as one of Arthur's chief councillors, and is also mentioned in a poem by fourteenth century bard [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]]:

:Three warriors – it brings me riches –
:knew well enchantments before this:
:battle-experienced, the first upholds his name –
:the gentlest of the three was Menw
:the second's name (good day for understanding):
:is Eiddilig the Dwarf, a wily Irishman
:third was, beside the seas of [[Anglesey|Mon]],
:[[Math fab Mathonwy|Math]], lord of splendid kind, and
:Arfon's king.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hughes. ''Math uab Mathonwy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8028">'''Michael Roy Toney''' (December 29, 1965 – October 3, 2009) was charged and wrongfully convicted in 1999 for a bombing that killed three people and injured two others in [[Lake Worth, Texas]], in 1985.&lt;ref name="Texas Department of Criminal Justice"&gt;[http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/toneymichael.htm Texas Department of Criminal Justice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611194254/http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/toneymichael.htm |date=2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toney was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] and spent ten years on death row. On December 17, 2008, Toney's conviction was vacated by the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] because of prosecutorial misconduct.&lt;ref name= "Death Penalty Information Center"&gt;[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/michael-toney-recently-exonerated-death-row-texas-dies-car-crash Death Penalty Information Center]&lt;/ref&gt; Toney was released from custody in September 2009 and died in a car accident about a month later.

==Early life==
Toney grew up in [[Cottonwood, California]], a small town in [[Shasta County, California|Shasta County]] about {{convert|90|mi}} north of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. His father left the family early in his life, and his mother worked in local taverns. She would bring home a number of men who would beat her and her sons. To escape from this, Toney would often retreat to a shed. When Toney was 9 or 10 years old, one of her boyfriends strapped him to a chair, [[duct-tape]]d his wrists down and set fire to his hands. When he was 15, another one of his mother's boyfriends attacked him with a [[fishing gaff]] and gouged a huge hole in his hip. He quit school before the 10th grade and left for Texas, settling down in [[Hurst-Euless]], in the [[Bedford, Texas|Bedford]] area of [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant County]]. He married a woman named Kim when he was 38 years old.&lt;ref name="The Case Story"&gt;[http://www.michaeltoney.com/case.htm Case Story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830181454/http://www.michaeltoney.com/case.htm |date=2010-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case==
On the evening of [[Thanksgiving Day]], November 28, 1985, in the [[Hilltop Mobile Home Park]] between [[Lake Worth, Texas|Lake Worth]] and [[Azle, Texas]], several members of the Blount family were celebrating the holiday together in the Blounts' trailer. The family included Joe Blount, a 44-year-old skilled mechanic; his wife Susan; their 15-year-old daughter Angela; their son Robert; Joe's brother Carl; and Michael Columbus, Carl's son. 

After the family ate Thanksgiving dinner, Ray Blount went home around 5:00 p.m. Around 9:00 p.m., Susan Blount went to lie down for a nap. Joe Blount drove Robert, Angela and Michael to a [[convenience store]] about half a mile away from the park where they bought snacks and beer. Susan soon heard a knock at the front door. She looked out the window but did not see anybody, so she returned to her nap. When the rest of family returned from the convenience store, they discovered a [[briefcase]] on the doorstep. The three teenagers were excited because they thought that the briefcase might have either money or jewels in it. After bringing the briefcase inside, Angela opened the latches and it exploded.&lt;ref name="The Case Story"/&gt; Joe, Angela, and Michael were killed when a bomb in the briefcase exploded.&lt;ref name="The Case Story"/&gt;

==Conviction==
In June 1997, Toney was in jail awaiting a hearing for a [[burglary]] that happened in 1993. Here he was talking to Charles "Jack" Ferris in [[Parker County, Texas|Parker County]] Jail in [[Weatherford, Texas]]. The two men began talking about the bombing. Ferris was then released from jail by telling the Parker County authorities that Toney had confessed to him. After Ferris told the authorities, the investigators questioned Toney's ex-wife. In the beginning, Ms. Toney told prosecutors, "Michael killing people in a bombing? You're nuts." But Ms. Toney decided to do some research on the case. When she realized what had taken place, she called federal agents and told her story. Soon after, Toney was indicted for [[capital punishment|capital murder]].&lt;ref name="The Case Story"/&gt;

Months passed, and Ferris changed his story about Toney's alleged confession to the crime. Ferris explained how Toney had come up with the story in order to get him out of jail earlier. He told investigators that "Toney and me made up the entire thing."&lt;ref name="The Case Story"/&gt;

==Trial==
The trial started in May 1999, in Fort Worth, Texas. Susan and Robert Blount gave their [[testimony]] as to what happened that day. Then the testimony from his ex-wife, his ex-best friend and another cellmate occurred. His ex-wife said that she, Toney and his best friend Chris Meeks went to a [[propane]] shop that was adjacent to the Hilltop Mobile Home Park. She says that Toney got out of the truck with a briefcase and disappeared. She then said he returned without the briefcase and they then went to the [[Nature Center]] and stayed for several hours. Her testimony also included that Toney shot a [[beaver]] with a rifle while they were at the Nature Center.&lt;ref name="The Case Story"/&gt;

A cellmate of Michael Toney, Finis Blankenship, testified that Toney told him that he was paid $5,000 for the murders. Blankenship also said that the murders were part of a drug-related hit, but the bomb was put on the wrong doorstep. His testimony came in the second phase of the trial. This helped the jury decide whether Toney deserved to be executed. This testimony showed the jury that Toney had a motive for the crime. At the time, Blankenship was facing two counts of indecency with a child and habitual-criminal charges, so he says that he agreed to testify against Toney in exchange for having the charges dropped. Blankenship now says that his testimony was a lie. Chris Meeks' testimony didn't coincide with all of Ms. Toney's testimony. Meeks changed his story four times. At first he told investigators that he knew nothing about the bombing as well as the [[grand jury]]. He also failed a [[polygraph]] test. In 2001, he signed an [[affidavit]] taking back the things he said during his testimony. He said, "My testimony about the events that happened on Thanksgiving day, 1985, may not have happened on that day."&lt;ref name="The Case Story"/&gt;

Toney said that he did not hear about the crime until 1997. He said that he had never been to the Hilltop Mobile Home Park and that he didn't he even know it existed until just prior to his trial. Ms. Toney and Mr. Meeks said that Toney was driving a truck on the night of the bombing. However,  Toney said that he didn't buy the truck until December 13, 1985, a month after the incident.&lt;ref name="The Case Story"/&gt;

Considine came to prominence in the early 2000s with a string of performances in [[independent film]] that prompted ''[[The Observer]]'' to describe him as "the best-kept secret in British movies".&lt;ref name="Ojumu"&gt;Ojumu, Akin (2001) "[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/mar/11/features.review Paddy Considine: The best-kept secret in British movies]", ''[[The Observer]]'', 11 March 2001, retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to leading and supporting roles in Hollywood films, he has acted in independent British films and television shows such as ''[[The Suspicions of Mr Whicher]]'' (2014).

==Early life==
Considine was born in [[Burton upon Trent]], Staffordshire, where he still resides.&lt;ref name="Ojumu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="observer-lewis"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/paddy-considine-actor-i-was-portrayed-angry-i-was-just-ill | date = 7 September 2014 | accessdate = 8 September 2014 | first = Tim | last = Lewis | newspaper = [[The Observer]] | title = Paddy Considine: ‘I was always portrayed as angry, but I was just ill’}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up with his brother and sisters in a council estate in [[Winshill]], a suburb of Burton.&lt;ref name="observer-lewis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mottram"&gt;Mottram, James (2009) [http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment/-Interview-Paddy-Considine-actor.5697674.jp Interview: Paddy Considine, actor], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 2 October 2009, retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Considine attended, among other schools, [[Abbot Beyne School|Abbot Beyne Senior School]] and [[Burton &amp; South Derbyshire College|Burton College]]. In 1990, Considine enrolled to do a National Diploma in Performing Arts at Burton College, where he first met [[Shane Meadows]].&lt;ref name="Ojumu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mottram" /&gt; Neither of them completed the course.

In 1994, Considine moved away to study photography at the [[University of Brighton]]. While there he studied under the social documentarian [[Paul Reas]], who described one project, portraits of Considine's parents in their house in Winshill, as "fucking brilliant".&lt;ref name="observer-lewis" /&gt; At one point, Considine was threatened with expulsion, but graduated with a first-class B.A.&lt;ref name="Ojumu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="observer-lewis" /&gt;

==Acting career==
After graduating from university, Meadows cast Considine in several short films, as well as his second film, ''[[A Room for Romeo Brass]]'' (1999). Considine, in his screen debut, played the disturbed character Morell.&lt;ref name="Hoby"&gt;Hoby, Hermione (2009) "[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/27/donk-shane-meadows-paddy-considine Paddy and Shane: story of a partnership]", ''[[The Observer]]'', 27 September 2009, retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Considine's performance in the film led to [[Pawel Pawlikowski]] casting him in his first starring role in ''[[Last Resort (2000 film)|Last Resort]]'' (2000). Considine played the love-struck misfit Alfie, for which he won the Best Actor award at the [[Thessaloniki Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/content/articles/2005/01/04/paddy_considine_film_feature.shtml Local Heroes: Paddy Considine]", [[BBC]], 4 January 2005, retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; After coming to prominence for his roles as Alfie and Morell, Considine increased his profile during the early to mid-2000s with supporting and starring roles in cult films such as ''[[24 Hour Party People]]'' and ''[[In America (film)|In America]]''.

In 2004, Considine starred in what was then the most significant role of his career, as Richard in Meadows' revenge film ''[[Dead Man's Shoes (2004 film)|Dead Man's Shoes]]'' (2004), a film he co-wrote&lt;ref name="Barkham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoby" /&gt; and for which he won the Best British Actor award at the 2005 [[Empire Awards]].&lt;ref name="Hoby" /&gt; In the same year, he starred in ''[[My Summer of Love]]'', his second film with director [[Pawel Pawlikowski]]. Both films were recognised on the award circuit, where Considine earned five nominations and two wins. The following year, Considine played Frank Thorogood (the suspected murderer of [[Rolling Stones]] co-founder [[Brian Jones]]) in ''[[Stoned (film)|Stoned]]'' (2005). It was around this time that Considine earned his reputation as a popular portrayer of cinema villains, antiheroes, and darker characters. 2005 also saw the release of Considine's second Hollywood film, ''[[Cinderella Man]]''.&lt;ref name=McClean&gt;{{cite news|last=McClean|first=Craig|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/sep/11/features.magazine|title=And the winner is ...|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=11 September 2005|accessdate=20 April 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considine appeared in the Spanish thriller ''[[Bosque de Sombras]]'' (2006). It was during the filming of this that Considine penned what later became his debut short, ''[[Dog Altogether]]''. Considine claims that it was his co-star [[Gary Oldman]] who gave him confidence to make the film, which led to him thanking Oldman during his [[BAFTA]] acceptance speech. In 2006, he starred in ''[[Pu-239 (film)|Pu-239]]'' as Timofey Berezin, a worker at a Russian nuclear facility who gets exposed to a lethal dose of radiation. In 2007, Considine landed roles in two popular big budget films; the third film in the ''[[Bourne (film series)|Bourne Trilogy]]'' film series, ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'', in which he played newspaper reporter Simon Ross,&lt;ref name="Barkham" /&gt; and ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'', in which he had his first comedic role as DS Andy Wainwright. In 2008, Considine starred in ''[[My Zinc Bed (2008 film)|My Zinc Bed]]'' a TV film for [[BBC]] / [[HBO]]. In 2009, he starred as Peter Hunter in the Channel 4 miniseries ''[[Red Riding]]: 1980'', based on the novels by [[David Peace]], and another collaboration with Meadows, ''[[Le Donk &amp; Scor-zay-zee]]'', a film which was unscripted, adlibbed, and filmed in five days at a cost of £48,000, and which premiered at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Mottram" /&gt;

In 2011, Considine starred in a [[Submarine (2010 film)|film adaptation]] of [[Joe Dunthorne]]'s book ''Submarine'', which [[Richard Ayoade]] wrote and directed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flicksnews.net/2009/05/paddy-considne-michael-sheen-board.html|title=Paddy Considine &amp; Michael Sheen Board Richard Ayoade's 'Submarine'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2011, Considine appeared as Porter Nash in the adaptation of the [[Ken Bruen]] novel ''[[Blitz (film)|Blitz]]'', as well as starring as [[Jack Whicher]] in ''[[The Suspicions of Mr Whicher]]'', written by [[Helen Edmundson]] and Neil McKay. In the same year, Considine was briefly reunited with one of his ''A Room for Romeo Brass'' co-stars, BAFTA-winning actress [[Vicky McClure]]. The two shared the screen in a television advert to promote "Films for Life Season". The ad was shot over two days in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.film4.com/videos/article/film4-films-for-life|title=Films for live 90-second trailer|author=film4.com|publisher=film4.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considine has consistently displayed a flair for regional and world accents; along with the Gypsy Midlander Morell in his first role in 1999's ''A Room for Romeo Brass'', Considine played a Londoner in ''Stoned'' and ''The Suspicions of Mr Whicher'', a Russian nuclear plant worker in ''Pu-239'', a Welshman in ''Submarine'', ''Happy Now'' and ''Pride'', an Irish immigrant in ''In America'', a Mancunian in ''Red Riding'', a Yorkshireman in ''My Summer of Love'', an American in ''Cry of the Owl'' and ''Cinderella Man'', and a West Countryman in ''Hot Fuzz''. He has appeared in several music videos, most notably "[[God Put A Smile Upon Your Face]]" (2002) by [[Coldplay]] and [[Moloko]]'s "Familiar Feeling" (2003),&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; as well as the [[Arctic Monkeys]] track "[[Leave Before the Lights Come On]]" (2006), for which he wrote the video.&lt;ref name="Mottram" /&gt;

Considine starred in ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]'', as one of the "Five Musketeers" reattempting an "epic" pub crawl. Considine previously worked with the cast and crew on ''Hot Fuzz'' (2007). The film was released in the United Kingdom on 19 July 2013, and the United States on 23 August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecomet.net/news/martin_freeman_and_paddy_considine_join_the_world_s_end_cast_1_1573319|title=Martin Freeman and Paddy Considine join The World's End cast}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, Considine confirmed that he was writing the screenplay for the film ''Journeyman'', in which he will also star. It is an adaptation of [[non-fiction novel]] ''The Years of the Locust'' by [[Jon Hotten]], the true story of a sociopathic boxing promoter, Fat Rick Parker, and his doomed relationship with his naive fighter, Tim Anderson.&lt;ref name="charlottecripps"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/macbeth-actor-paddy-considine-on-his-secret-life-as-a-rock-star-10438584.html|title=Macbeth actor Paddy Considine on his secret life as a rock star|author=Charlotte Cripps|date=4 August 2015|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considine is also writing a film from a ghost story called ''The Leaning'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paddyconsidine.co.uk/Site_Interview_December10.htm|title=Paddy Considine: Here Comes the Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; with plans to direct both films. He will continue to work with Shane Meadows on ''King of the Gypsies'', a biopic of bare-knuckle fighter [[Bartley Gorman]], whom Considine met and became friends with whilst working as a photographer.&lt;ref name="Barkham" /&gt; In 2015, Considine was announced as having been cast along [[Glenn Close]], [[Gemma Arterton]] in the UK zombie film in ''[[The Girl with All the Gifts (film)|The Girl with All the Gifts]]'', based on the 2014 novel ''[[The Girl with All the Gifts]]'' by [[M. R.

On 4 October 2015, it was via Considine's official Twitter page that he was about to join the cast of Birmingham-set gangster series ''[[Peaky Blinders (TV series)|Peaky Blinders]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=PaddyConsidine|author=Paddy Considine ☠️|number=650577646213025792|date=4 October 2015|title=So, I start work on 'Peaky Blinders' season 3 this week... Looking forward to it!}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeing him reunited with ''She Who Brings Gifts'' director Colm McCarthy.

In April 2017, Considine made his professional stage debut in [[The Ferryman (play)|''The Ferryman'']] at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], ahead of a transfer to the [[Gielgud Theatre]] in the [[West End Theatre|West End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://variety.com/2017/legit/reviews/the-ferryman-review-jez-butterworth-sam-mendes-1202409168/| title = London Theater Review: Jez Butterworth’s ‘The Ferryman,’ Directed by Sam Mendes| author = Trueman, Matt| date = 4 May 2017| accessdate = 7 May 2017| publisher = ''Variety''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/theatre/the-ferryman-theatre-review-a-shattering-feast-of-intricate-storytelling-a3530066.html| title = The Ferryman, theatre review: A shattering feast of intricate storytelling| author = Hitchings, Henry| date = 3 May 2017| accessdate = 7 May 2017| publisher = ''Evening Standard''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WhatsOnStage.com"&gt;{{cite web | title=Cast and West End transfer confirmed for Sam Mendes' The Ferryman | website=WhatsOnStage.com | date=8 February 2017 | url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/casting-ferryman-paddy-considine-sam-mendes-royal-court_42833.html | accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the fastest selling play in Royal Court Theatre history.

==Film-making career==
In 2007, Paddy Considine wrote and directed the award-winning short film ''[[Dog Altogether]]'', starring [[Peter Mullan]], partially based on Considine's father. ''Dog Altogether'' won the [[61st British Academy Film Awards|2007 BAFTA award]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Short Film|Best Short Film]], as well as a [[Silver Lion]] for Best Short Film at the [[64th Venice International Film Festival|2007 Venice Film Festival]], a [[British Independent Film Awards Best British Short|Best British Short]] at the [[British Independent Film Awards 2007|2007 British Independent Film Awards]] (BIFA), and the Seattle International Film Festival Short Film Jury Award (Narrative Special Jury Prize),&lt;ref name="Barkham" /&gt; as well as a World Cinema Directing Award for his feature directorial debut ''Tyrannosaur'' at the 2011 [[Sundance Film Festival]].

==Musical career==
After a short stint in a virtual comedy thrash group called Grunt during college, Considine and Shane Meadows formed the band [[She Talks To Angels]] (inspired by the [[Black Crowes]] song of the same name) with friends Richard Eaton, Simon Hudson, and [[Nick Hemming]], with Meadows as vocalist and Considine as drummer.&lt;ref name="Mottram" /&gt; Considine left the band, the remaining members re-formed, calling themselves Oslo. Appearing on Jools Holland's show, whilst Considine had moved on to study photography at the University of Brighton, where he formed a new group, a Britpop band called Pedestrians.&lt;ref name="charlottecripps"/&gt; He is now in a rock band called Riding the Low,&lt;ref name="observer-lewis" /&gt; who have released an [[Extended play|EP]] 'They Will Rob You of Your Gifts' (2009),&lt;ref name="Mottram" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NME"&gt;[http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/47799 "''Le Donk'' actor Paddy Considine launches new band"], ''[[NME]]'', 12 October 2009, retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and an album 'What Happened to the Get To Know Ya?' (2013).

Considine and Riding the Low got their big music break in 2014 after [[Tim Burgess (musician)|Tim Burgess]] of [[The Charlatans (English band)|the Charlatans]] invited them to perform at his curated Tim Peaks Diner event at Festival No 6 in [[Portmeirion]], Wales. Considine had contacted Burgess after reading his book [[Telling Stories]], to discuss meditation. "The conversation developed and Tim generously offered to let us play at Portmeirion, It led to the band supporting the Charlatans at the O2 Academy in Leicester this year. I didn't get stage fright. We were ready. We did our history off-camera. We have evolved. We have got better. At first it was raw – all we had was arrogance. We had a long way to go and we learnt our craft at all these pub gigs. We didn't expect a leg-up just because an actor is in the band." said Considine&lt;ref name="charlottecripps"/&gt;

2016 saw the band release their second full-length album ''Are Here to Help the Neighbourhood'', recorded in [[Rockfield Studios]] and produced by Chris Slusarenko. Considine penned the words while the band wrote the music.

In early 2018, Considine confirmed that the long anticipated collaboration with Wigan saxophonist Andrew Teddy Brown would finally be released in February 2019 as a concept album entitled Limping Through Life - an epic tale of the struggle faced by a man with a terminal form of Gout. In November 2018, Considine and Brown confirmed that the debut single from Limping Through Life would be called Days Of Delirium - a song about the extreme highs felt by the album’s central character after taking suppositories to combat Gout.

==Personal life==
Considine remains private in his personal life and once stated that if he ever became a celebrity, he'd "disappear and go and make shoes like [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]" (a reference to Day-Lewis' sabbatical working as a [[shoemaker]] in Italy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paddyconsidine.co.uk/Observermag05.htm|title=And the winner is...: ''Observer Magazine'', 11 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considine lives in his home town of [[Burton upon Trent]] with his family.&lt;ref name=Barkham&gt;{{cite news|last=Barkham|first=Patrick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/03/paddy-considine-red-riding|title=Dark star|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 March 2009|accessdate=20 April 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considine's late father was Irish.&lt;ref name=McLean&gt;{{cite news|last=McLean|first=Craig|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/8765631/Paddy-Considines-domestic-drama.html|title=Paddy Considine's domestic drama|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 September 2011|accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been with his wife Shelley since he was 18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/paddy-considine-actor-i-was-portrayed-angry-i-was-just-ill| title=Paddy Considine: 'I was always portrayed as angry, but I was just ill'| author=Tim Lewis| date=September 7, 2014| publisher=The Guardian| access-date=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
In April 2011, Considine revealed that he had been diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Lockyer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lockyer|first=Daphne|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/8440399/Paddy-Considine-Knowing-I-have-Aspergers-is-a-relief.html|title=Paddy Considine: Knowing I have Asperger's is a relief|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 April 2011|accessdate=12 April 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.ie/showbiz/news/a313837/paddy-considine-reveals-aspergers-diagnosis.html|title=Paddy Considine reveals Asperger's diagnosis|author=Kate Goodacre|publisher=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially reassured by the diagnosis, he continued to struggle in social situations until he was diagnosed in 2013 with [[Scotopic sensitivity syndrome|Irlen syndrome]], a condition in which the brain cannot adequately process visual stimuli. His condition has improved significantly since he began wearing purple [[Irlen filters]].&lt;ref name="Irlen Syndrome"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paddy Considine battling rare sight disorder|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/playlist/view/313343/Paddy-Considine-battling-rare-sight-disorder/|newspaper=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|The Daily Star]]|date=7 May 2013|accessdate=7 May 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prudence Nobantu Mabele''' (July 21, 1971 – July 10, 2017) was a South African activist who advocated for the rights of women and children living with HIV and against gender-based violence.

==Early life==

Prudence was born in the Wattville Township near Benoni, in the east of Johannesburg, South Africa on the 21st of July 1971. She was raised by her caring grandmother Nosifako Elizabeth Mabele and her grandfather July Mabele as her mother was in exile and her father an Umkhotho wesizwe soldier.  The first of four sisters, Prudence left Wattville for Pietermaritzburg to obtain secondary education and afterward attended the Witwatersrand Technikon and Cape Town Technikon in 1990 when she was first diagnosed with HIV infection.  Despite several challenges occasioned by the diagnosis of HIV infection at a young age, Prudence successfully obtained a Diploma in Light Current Electrical Engineering in 1994.   Her other academic accomplishments include a Diploma in Psychology Intec College, 1996), a Diploma in Management from the Wits Business School and Certificates on “Women in Management”, “HIV and AIDS Leadership” and “Monitoring and Evaluation for Sexual and Reproductive Health Programs.6

Mabele completed her training as a sangoma (traditional doctor) in 2004.

==Organisations affiliated to Mabele==

At her death, Mabele was the President of the Society for Women and AIDS in Africa, Executive Director of Positive Women's Network, an organisation she founded, and Deputy Chair of the Civil Society Forum - South African National AIDS Council.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enca.com/south-africa/prudence-mabele-leading-hiv-activist-dies|title=Prudence Mabele, leading HIV activist, dies|website=www.enca.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mabele was also a founding co-chair of WomenNOW! Summit on Pan-African &amp; African Diasporan Women's Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health and Justice.

Prudence has held several leadership positions including being a founding member of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) and the National Association of People Living with HIV and AIDS (NAPWA) in 1994; a founding member and former executive committee Chair of the AIDS Consortium. 6

==HIV==

Mabele was diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1990. She stated that she "looked for people she could share her anxiety with. But her search for a friend led her to hospital wards full of dying babies". It was during this time that she saw the need for a support group for women.

"In 1992 spurred by the need to act against the silence and stigma that surrounded HIV Mabele took the bold step to become one of the first black women in South Africa to publicly disclose her HIV status at a time when the first democratic elections were two years away and HIV was associated with white gay men. She was then forced to change her course of study from Medical Technology to Electrical Engineering because of perceived risks to future patients she might work with. This defining decision prepared her for a long and challenging professional life in which she steadfastly stood up for herself as a young woman living with HIV and promoted policies and programs that would benefit women in general. For example, as far back as 1996, Mabele through her work with Yale University and the South African Department of Health was instrumental in introducing female condoms to South Africa. " 6 

"Mabele responded positively to her own situation at a tender age and learned to confront and challenge prejudices both at the community level and in the healthcare profession.  Within South Africa and outside South Africa, she has contributed enormously toward the “meaningful participation of people living with HIV”, ensuring that they are just not seen but listened to and their expertise utilized.  Without a doubt, she has been one of the key global champions highlighting the gravity of the issues faced by girls and young women on the continent in the context of the HIV/AIDS pandemic." 6 

"As a volunteer at the Red Cross Children’s Hospital counselling HIV positive mothers and babies in 1993, Prudence became inspired by this experience to found the Positive Women Network in 1996 to address the social and reproductive health needs of positive women."6 In 1996, Mabele and five other women founded the Positive Women's Network of South Africa&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bhekisisa.org/article/2013-11-29-00-the-sangoma-who-lives-for-science|title=Remembering Prudence Mabele: The sangoma who lived for science|last=Skosana|first=Ina|website=Bhekisisa|language=en|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; "to provide a space for HIV positive women to address our economic, educational and health needs and to project our voices and demands for services, rights and respect.."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africanfeministforum.com/prudence-nobantu-mabele/|title=Prudence Nobantu Mabele - African Feminist Forum|date=2016-03-24|work=African Feminist Forum|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As one of South Africa’s leading spokespersons and an advocate for people living with HIV, in 2004 Mabele carried the Olympic torch as part of an international torch relay for the 2004 Olympics in Greece.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mabele was renowned for her work with women's HIV support groups. Colleague and friend Sisonke Msimang wrote of her: "Donors stopped funding support groups because they were no longer fashionable. But Pru knew the truth, which was that life for women happens in conversations, in the time it takes to sit with one another. Those groups were emotional life support for women who were in critical condition, whose lives had been shattered and whose hearts needed piecing together. Pru did that work. She visited so many grieving families. When lesbians were killed, Pru went. When another HIV-positive woman died, Pru was there. When a woman was murdered, Pru was at the front. Painted up, dolled up, voice ragged, breathing through her mouth, swearing and joking and sweating, she was there."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2017-07-12-prudence-mabele-my-guide-to-the-new-south-africa|title=The Pied Piper of the broken-hearted: HIV activist Prudence Mabele|last=Msimang|first=Sisonke|work=The M&amp;G Online|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender advocate==

Mabele was a strong advocate for ending violence against women and was a member of the One in Nine Campaign. One in Nine began in response to the rape trial of Jacob Zuma, who was at that time, Deputy President. One in Nine is named for the fact that only One in Nine women in South Africa reports crime to the police, a stark piece of evidence as to how inaccessible and unwelcoming the police and judicial system in SA is.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Mabele herself said: "I believe that the quality of women’s leadership is even more important than the numbers of women in leadership."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Mabele was one of the founding members of the Bring Back Our Girls South Africa campaign.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mabele also starred in a film called Sunshine Boutique.

== Global work ==

"For over two decades, Prudence has played a pioneering and leading role in the fight against HIV/AIDS and has been recognized internationally, nationally and regionally for her dedicated contribution to the HIV response." 6 

"Mabele made her global debut at the Beijing Women’s Conference in 1995, in which she was a previously unknown young woman from the African continent who counselled everyone, including the powerful, about the need to seek solutions from those directly experiencing the effects of the epidemic."6

"On the regional and global level, Prudence worked extensively from 1997 in different countries as a member of the Commonwealth program called Positive Young Ambassadors of Hope which attempted to increase the visibility of HIV and youth. This opened the door for her work with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as a GIPA (Greater Involvement of People living with HIV and AIDS) consultant to enhance the acceptance of HIV positive persons in the workplace. Her other assignments include those with UNAIDS, United Nations Development Program, UNFPA, the World Bank, the African Union, and the governments of Venezuela, Botswana, Nigeria and the United States. She has also supported the work of numerous international organisations such as Oxfam, Voluntary Services Overseas, the European Union Human Rights Foundation, Amnesty International, the Centre for Development and Population Activities, the Population Council and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission and the Society of Women and AIDS in Africa. One of Mabele's key strengths was her ability to maintain ties locally, nationally, regionally and internationally and to permeate these spaces with a message of hope and resilience." 6

"It is a tribute to her international profile that Prudence was one of the Olympic torch bearers for the Athens 2004 Olympic Torch Relay event where the theme was "Pass the flame, unite the world".  This worldwide relay united the five continents and travelled to 33 cities in 26 countries." 6

"At the World Social Forum in Brazil in 2005, Prudence gave a presentation on defending women’s knowledge against free trade agreement. This information was shared with indigenous women from Latin America, and included discussions about traditional medicines – and how this century-old wisdom has often been stolen by trans-national pharmaceutical companies – without compensation." 6 

"It was no surprise given Prudence’s contributions on the continent and globally, that the African Women’s Development Fund’s in 2010 honoured her with Woman of Substance Award for being a mobilizer par excellence with a vision and commitment to the advancement of women with HIV and AIDS and a source of hope to women."

"In 2010, Prudence was on the cover page of one of UNAIDS Outlook Reports. She was quoted thus “One of the greatest satisfactions I get from my work is to see a woman taking the steps toward knowing herself, accepting her HIV status, learning to stay healthy and ultimately becoming a leader and agent of change”. This is precisely what Mabele’s life has been about." 6  


==Stance on Traditional medicine and Western ARVs==

Mabele was herself a trained sangoma and took ARVs when they became available on the public health system in South Africa. She supported the use of ARVs because she herself had first-hand seen the destruction caused by AIDS. Mabele answered her calling to become a traditional healer several years after starting ARVs, and almost a decade after she found out her HIV status.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Mabele was, in fact, the target of a march in 2004 when more than 500 traditional healers marched to give her a petition against the [[Treatment Action Campaign]] (TAC). The issue was that TAC was only promoting ARVs and not traditional medicine. 

"That was very interesting. I had to go and collect their memorandum. Antiretrovirals [ARVs] were still new in South Africa and, as a healer, I was taking ARVs. It was serious. It was hectic. I was scared. They all looked at me as a traitor. I remember them coming [down the street], toyi-toying and singing 'phansi ngo Prudence' [down with Prudence]! They were saying that we [TAC] are more into ARVs than their herbs. But that was not the case. I am a healer; being on [medical] treatment helps me to stay balanced, it helps me to do all my rituals and it helps me to dance. It makes me feel good."

== Quotes ==

"For Prudence, hard work goes with fun and happiness. Those who know her well know that she is constantly on the move and makes every attempt to live her life to the fullest. She enjoys music, movies, arts, and drama.  She loves clothes and shoes and admires the creativity of many South African designers.  Prudence’s love for the arts and nature stems from the inner fulfilment she derides and the way in which these uplift her spiritually and connect with her African identity. There is so much we can say about Prudence – I believe most positive and reaffirming. However, she would like to describe herself as a woman that is a God-loving feminist and believes in women‘s rights, and the need to love and reach out to other people no matter their personal circumstances." [[Eka Esu Williams|Eka Williams]] at Mabele's 40th Birthday Celebration.6

==Death==

Prudence Mabele died from pneumonia on 10th July 2017. The family of Prudence Mabele announced her death saying:

"It is with profound sorrow that the Mabale family announces the death of their daughter Prudence Nobantu Mabele. A leading advocate for people living with HIV &amp; AIDS, a respected gender activist, and one of the first black women in South Africa to disclose her HIV status..."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Gonzalez was born on December 3, 1930 in [[La Carlota, Negros Occidental|La Carlota]], [[Negros Occidental]]. He was the fourth child of Delfin Quimbiong Gonzalez (son of Leon Gonzalez and Felisa Quimbiong), the last mayor of the former town of [[Jaro, Iloilo City|Jaro]] in the province of [[Iloilo]]; and Maria Estrella Jover Maravilla (daughter of Tranquilino Maravilla and Consuelo Jover), a school teacher who were married on April 3, 1925 in [[Iloilo City]].&lt;ref name="parents' marriage"&gt;[https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/FNS1-P3X Delfin Gonzalez and Estrella Maravilla's Marriage Record]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gonzalez completed his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree at the Colegio de San Agustin (now [[University of San Agustin]]) and his [[Bachelor of Law]] degree at the  [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law]] in 1955.

Gonzales took the Philippine Bar Examination in 1955 and in the same year, passed with a grade of 99% in Remedial Law and 95% in International Law. He also topped the Judge Advocate General's Office (JAGO) Examinations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.op.gov.ph/profiles_gonzales.asp Office of the President website profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703114052/http://www.op.gov.ph/profiles_gonzales.asp |date=2007-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After passing the Bar, Gonzalez became  professor of law in the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law]], the [[Far Eastern University Institute of Law]], and the Philippine College of Commerce (now [[Polytechnic University of the Philippines]]). He was also a professorial lecturer at the [[Philippine Normal University|Philippine Normal University-Manila]] Graduate School, [[Assumption College]] and the [[College of Holy Spirit]]. He also lectured in the [[University of the Philippines]] Law Center Division of Continuing Legal Education.

==Government service and political career==
Gonzalez served in the Philippine government in various capacities. He started as a Legal Assistant to the Governor of Iloilo in 1960 before serving as Senior Legal Assistant to the Mayor of [[Manila]] in 1961. Gonzalez was Executive Member of the Board of Censors for Motion Pictures under the Office of the President from 1963 to 1969, and Senior Committee Counsel to the Committees on Labor and Immigration in the [[Philippine Senate]], among other positions. Gonzalez fought the martial law regime of Ferdinand Marcos by filing several petitions before the Supreme Court when only a few dared.{{cn|date=November 2015}}  These cases are now part of constitutional law and are part of the curriculum of every law school in the Philippines.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

In 1989, after the restoration of democracy, Gonzalez was suspended by the Supreme Court from the practice of law for an indefinite period as a [[Tanodbayan]] for ignorance of the law.&lt;ref name="InqTime"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reinstated four years later, in 1993.

Gonzalez entered politics in 1995, running for and winning as the representative of the lone [[Legislative district of Iloilo City]]. He kept the position for a total of three terms until 2004, the maximum consecutive allowed by the Philippine Constitution. His eldest son Raul Jr ran for the same position and won two terms immediately after his.

In 2000, as a congressman, he was one of the public prosecutors during the impeachment trial of then President [[Joseph Estrada]].  The trial ended abruptly in January 2001 when the President was replaced by then-Vice President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]].

Following [[Philippine general election, 2004|2004 election]], he was hounded by vote-buying controversies after he promised [[barangay captain]]s from the city of Iloilo to deliver 12-0 senatorial sweep for the administrations party in the midterm elections. The sweep did not occur.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} He also promised another cash incentives and free trip to Hong Kong if Iloilo City Council oppositionists Perla Zulueta and [[Lex Tupas]] were not to make it to the top 12 (which they did not).{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

On June 4, 2008 Gonzalez was appointed the Secretary of Justice by President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/99135/Gonzalez-gets-CA-nod-after-four-years gmanews.tv, Gonzalez gets CA nod after four years]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=121412  abs-cbnnews.com, CA confirms Gonzalez, Puno and others]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a controversial statement made during the April 20, 2007 broadcast of a local news program, Philippine Justice Secretary [[Raul Gonzalez (Philippines)|Raul Gonzalez]] stated that murdered American journalist [[Julia Campbell (journalist)|Julia Campbell]] was partially to blame for her death. He stated that the Peace Corps volunteer was "a little irresponsible" and that "if she was not alone, it would not have happened.". He also called Campbell "careless" in the same statement.&lt;ref name="TVPatrol20070419"&gt;{{cite episode | title = TV Patrol World | episodelink  =  | series = TV Patrol | serieslink = | credits = | network = ABS-CBN | station = ABS-CBN Channel 2 | location = Metro Manila | airdate =2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GMA1"&gt;{{cite news | title =Campbell partly to blame for own tragedy- DOJ | work =Nation | publisher =GMANews.TV | date =April 19, 2007 | url =http://www.gmanews.tv/story/39014/Gonzalez-Campbell-partly-to-blame-for-own-tragedy | accessdate =April 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private life==
Gonzalez is married to Dr. Pacita Trinidad, a former Representative of the second district of [[Zambales]], with whom he has four children.  Their eldest son, Raul Gonzalez Jr., is a former Representative of [[Iloilo City]]. Another son is the current president of the National Book Development Board, an organization committed to upgrade the publishing industry in the Philippines.

Gonzalez was diagnosed end stage renal disease on September 2007. Later that year, he received a [[kidney transplant]] from his driver, Felicito Gunay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=92589  Abs-Cbn Interactive, Gonzalez 'fully awake, conversant' a day after kidney transplant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918225916/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=92589 |date=2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=88823  Inquirer.net,  Driver gives Gonzalez gift of life]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quinnell played loose forward in Wigan's 25-16 victory over [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] in the [[1995–96 League Cup (rugby league)|1996]] [[League Cup (rugby league)|Regal Trophy]] final.&lt;ref name="13th January 1996: St Helens 16 Wigan 25 (Regal Trophy Final)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wigan.rlfans.com/news.php?readmore=2976|title=13th January 1996: St Helens 16 Wigan 25 (Regal Trophy Final)|publisher=wigan.rlfans.com|date=31 December 2014|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also represented Wales in the [[1995 Rugby League World Cup]]. He said that the toughest game of rugby he ever played was the quarter-final against [[Samoa national rugby league team|Western Samoa]].&lt;ref name="Quinnell gives Millennium Magic the thumbs up"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2008.superleague.co.uk/article.php?id=10246|title=Quinnell gives Millennium Magic the thumbs up|publisher=SuperLeague|date=2008-04-15|accessdate=2008-04-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211151658/http://2008.superleague.co.uk/article.php?id=10246|archivedate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wales went out to England 25-10 in the semi-finals.

===Return to union===
Quinnell returned to rugby union with [[Richmond F.C.|Richmond]] in 1996. He was selected for the 1997 Lions tour of South Africa but a double hernia operation forced him to leave the tour.

He came back to his beloved [[Stradey Park]] in 1998. During the 1998-99 season he did no conditioning work at all as he had rheumatoid arthritis in his left knee. For seven years he played through the pain barrier with the condition that seemed likely to end his career.

He was part of a Welsh team that won eight straight games before the 1999 World Cup and then reached the World Cup quarter-finals where they went out 24-9 to the eventual winners [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]]. He captained Wales for the first time in a 23-13 defeat by [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] at the [[Millennium Stadium]]. Quinnell played his last game for Wales as a replacement in a 32-21 win over Canada in 2002 after winning 52 caps.

He was again selected for the 2001 Lions tour to Australia where he played in all three tests, and scored a try in the first test in [[Brisbane]].

After the Welsh domestic game went regional in 2003, he appeared 59 times for the Scarlets, scoring 32 tries. He was part of the Llanelli Scarlets team that won the [[Pro14|Celtic League]] title in 2004.
 
Quinnell announced his retirement from rugby union at the end of the 2004-05 season in order to concentrate on his role as coach of the Llanelli RFC [[Welsh Premier Division]] team. A hand injury suffered in March 2005 forced him to end his career a few weeks prematurely. He played his final game in a [[testimonial match]] with fellow retiree [[Rob Howley]] at the [[Millennium Stadium]]. Quinnell's Britain &amp; Ireland selection lost 57-67 to Howley's Rest of the World side.

===After retirement===
Quinnell currently regularly appears as a commentator and pundit on a number of [[Sky Sports]] televised rugby matches. He is also a People's Postcode Lottery ambassador and appears on the adverts. He is a co-presenter and coach (with [[Will Greenwood]]) of Sky's ''[[School of Hard Knocks (TV series)|School of Hard Knocks]]'' TV series. He has had a recurring guest role as himself in the [[Sky 1]] TV comedy series ''[[Stella (UK TV series)|Stella]]''. In 2017 he co-wrote (with psychologist Paul Boross) the book ''Leader On The Pitch'', with a foreword written by Sir Clive Woodward.

===Personal life===
Quinnell is married to Nicola, and the couple have three children. Having lived all of his life in Llanelli, in early 2009 in light of his increased media commitments, the family moved to [[Kenilworth]], [[Warwickshire]], although they have since moved back to [[South Wales]] to a smallholding near [[Usk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/05/17/scott-quinnell-heads-east-91466-23640620|title=Scott Quinnell heads east|publisher=walesonline.co.uk|date=2009-05-15|accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quinnell is [[dyslexia|dyslexic]], but was not diagnosed until his early 30s, when his lack of ability to read and write was correctly diagnosed. Having undertaken a series of therapies to resolve the condition, Quinnell is now a popular speaker on the matter. He has represented the Welsh Dyslexia Project, and also completed an autobiography&lt;ref name=autobiography&gt;Quinnell, Scott – The Hardest Test, published by Accent Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-906125-95-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the Accent Press Quick Reads series.

In August 2007 Quinnell was treated for serious injuries after slipping whilst entering a shower and falling through a glass shower door at his then home near Llanelli. He was taken to [[West Wales General Hospital]] in [[Carmarthen]] with a severed right [[triceps]], and glass embedded in his right arm, hand and knee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6927465.stm Quinnell hurt in shower accident]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Quinnell published a book on business leadership with Paul Boross.&lt;ref&gt;Quinnell, Scott – Leader on the Pitch, published by CGW Publishing, 2017, {{ISBN|978-1-9082934-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Stanislaus Joyce''' (December 17, 1884 – June 16, 1955) was an Irish teacher, scholar, diarist and writer who lived for many years in [[Trieste]]. He was the younger brother of [[James Joyce]]. He was generally known as Stanislaus Joyce to distinguish him from his [[John Stanislaus Joyce|father]], who shared the same name.

==Early life==
Born in County Dublin, Stanislaus was considered a "[[Sharpening stone|whetstone]]" by his more famous brother, who shared his ideas and his books with him. He was three years younger than James, and a constant boyhood companion. Stanislaus rebelled against his native Ireland as his brother had done, and, in 1905, he joined James's household in [[Trieste]] on Via Caterina, 1.

==Career==
Joyce worked as an English-language teacher in the [[Berlitz Language Schools|Berlitz School]] alongside his brother. In 1903, he had already begun to keep a diary that recorded his own thoughts on philosophical and literary matter as well as those of his brother; he later resumed this diary in Trieste. This ''Book of Days'', as he called it, sheds light on James Joyce's life between the years 1906 and 1909. The diary indicates that Stanislaus, truly "[[Cain and Abel|his brother's keeper]]", was called upon to rescue his brother from financial difficulties time and time again. After 1908, he maintained his own address, although he may have lived with his brother again for a time in 1909. 
    
Arrested as a [[Subversion|subversive]] on December 28, 1914, at the beginning of [[World War I]], he was interned by the Austrians at [[Katzenau]], near [[Linz]]. After his release, he moved in with his sister Eileen's family. Stanislaus took his brother's teaching position at Trieste's Scuola Superiore di Commercio "Revoltella" in 1920; this school later became assimilated into the [[University of Trieste]] and he continued on as a non-tenured professor of English until his death. Due to his anti-[[Fascism|Fascist]] views, Stanislaus moved to [[Florence]] sometime in 1941, where he may have been protected from the Germans by various wealthy Italian and American families.

==Books==
Joyce later published ''Recollections of James Joyce'' (1950); published after his death on June 16 ("[[Bloomsday]]") were ''My Brother's Keeper'' (1957), ''Dublin Diary'' (1962), and ''Complete Dublin Diary'' (1971). In the 1950s, Stanislaus had also assisted [[Richard Ellmann]], his brother's biographer, with Ellmann's monumental ''James Joyce'' (1959).  Hel also wrote an introduction for the translated version of Italo Svevo's ''As A Man Grows Older''.

Stanislaus often fought with his brother, as well as with his brother's wife [[Nora Barnacle]], but they shared a common literary philosophy despite the fact that Stanislaus had received less advanced schooling than his brother. Stanislaus, however, channelled these instincts into sober academic study rather than wild flights of literary fancy. Of his brother, Stanislaus wrote, 
&lt;blockquote&gt; It seems to me little short of a miracle that anyone should have striven to cultivate poetry or cared to get in touch with the current of European thought while living in a household such as ours, typical as it was of the squalor of a drunken generation. Some inner purpose transfigured him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classiclit.about.com/cs/articles/a/aa_mybrother.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101181817/http://classiclit.about.com/cs/articles/a/aa_mybrother.htm |archivedate=2005-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==
On 13 August 1928 Stanislaus married Nelly Lichtensteiger. They had one son, James, who was born in February 1943.

==Death==
Stanislaus died in the [[Free Territory of Trieste]], and is buried in [[Trieste]] at the ''Via della Pace'' cemetery.

'''Thomas Starr King''' (December 17, 1824 &amp;ndash; March 4, 1864) was an [[United States|American]] [[Universalist Church of America|Universalist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister, influential in [[California]] politics during the [[American Civil War]], and Freemason.&lt;ref name="freemason.org"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.freemason.org/newsEvents/article.htm;jsessionid=6B5087D99B7A2A816782490432B119AD.node1?id=10079| title=Thomas Starr King Honored at State Capitol| publisher=Masons of California| accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starr King spoke zealously in favor of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and was credited by [[Abraham Lincoln]] with preventing California from becoming a separate republic.

==Early life==
He was born on December 17, 1824, in [[New York City]] to Rev. Thomas Farrington King, a Universalist minister, and Susan Starr King. The sole support of his family at 15, he was forced to leave school. Inspired by men like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry Ward Beecher]], King embarked on a program of self-study for the ministry. At the age of 20 he took over his father's former pulpit at the Charlestown Universalist Church in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], [[Massachusetts]].

== Career ==
In 1849, he was appointed pastor of the [[Hollis Street Church]] in [[Boston]], where he became one of the most famous preachers in [[New England]].  He vacationed in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of [[New Hampshire]] and in 1859 published a book about the area entitled ''The White Hills; their Legends, Landscapes, &amp; Poetry''. In 1860 he accepted a call from the First Unitarian Church of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]]. In July of that year, he visited [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]] and was moved spiritually by its splendor. Upon returning to San Francisco,  he began preaching a series of sermons on Yosemite,  published letters about it in the ''[[Boston Evening Transcript]]'', and aligned himself with fellow abolitionist and landscape architect, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]],  to have Yosemite set aside as a reserve. Yosemite would become a [[California Department of Parks and Recreation|California State Park]] and eventually a [[National park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Smith| first=Jordan Fisher| title=Engineering Eden: The True Story of a Violent Death, a Trial, and a Fight Over Controlling Nature| publisher=Crown Publishers| location=New York City| date=June 7, 2016| pages=19–20| isbn=978-0307454263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starr King joined the Freemasons and was raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason in Oriental Lodge No. 144 in San Francisco, now Phoenix Lodge No. 144, and served as grand orator of the Grand Lodge of California in 1863.&lt;ref name="freemason.org" /&gt;

Starr King's younger brother, Edward Starr King, served as captain of the clipper ship ''[[Syren (clipper)|Syren]].'' Capt. Starr King arrived in San Francisco aboard ''Syren'' just two days after his elder brother's stirring 1861 speech about Washington and the Union, remarking, "Starr has the brains of the family, and I the brawn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wendte| first=Charles William| title=Thomas Starr King, patriot and preacher| publisher=Beacon Press| year=1921| location=Boston| pages=160–161| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CcoEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=clipper%20syren&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q=clipper%20syren&amp;f=false| isbn=978-0-548-00757-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sarcophagus of Thomas Starr King - San Francisco, CA - DSC05119.JPG|thumb|Plaque at Thomas Starr King sarcophagus.]]

During the Civil War, Starr King spoke zealously in favor of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and was credited by [[Abraham Lincoln]] with preventing California from becoming a separate republic. At the urging of [[Jessie Benton Frémont]], Starr King teamed up with writer [[Bret Harte]], and Starr King read Harte's patriotic poems at pro-Union speeches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Bohemians: Mark Twain and the San Francisco Writers Who Reinvented American Literature| last=Tarnoff| first=Benjamin| publisher=Penguin Books| year=2014| isbn=978-1594204739| location=| pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starr King also read original verses by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and [[James Russell Lowell]] which captured the imagination of the Californians. In a letter by Starr King wrote to [[James Thomas Fields|James T. Fields]], the editor of the ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]'', "The state must be Northernized thoroughly, by schools, Atlantic Monthlies, lectures, N.E. preachers."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition, he organized the Pacific Branch of the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], which raised money and medical materials for wounded soldiers and was the predecessor to the [[American Red Cross]].  A fiery orator, he raised more than $1.5 million for the Sanitary Commission headquarters in [[New York City]], one-fifth of the total contributions from all the states in the Union.

== Death ==
The relentless lecture circuit exhausted him, and he died in San Francisco on March 4, 1864, of [[diphtheria]] and [[pneumonia]].

===Statue in California State Capitol===

[[Image:Thomas Starr King2.jpg|Thomas Starr King|150px|right|Thomas Starr King ([[National Statuary Hall Collection]] statue, now located at the California State Capitol)]]

As part of honors originally paid to Rev. King, he was judged worthy of representing California in the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] displayed in the [[United States Capitol]]. In 1913, King was voted one of California's two greatest heroes and funds were appropriated for a statue. In 1931, California officially donated a bronze statue of King to be mounted in Statuary Hall.

On August 31, 2006, however, the California Legislature approved a joint resolution to replace Thomas Starr King's statue in Statuary Hall with a statue of [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200520060SJR3| title=Senate Joint Resolution No. 3| date=September 8, 2006| publisher=California Legislature| accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was authored by Republican State Senator [[Dennis Hollingsworth]], who stated the reason for the resolution as, "To be honest with you, I wasn't sure who Thomas Starr King was, and I think there's probably a lot of Californians like me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/NATIONAL-STATUARY-HALL-Debate-urged-on-Starr-2548900.php |title=Debate urged on Starr King eviction |accessdate=2013-04-15 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |first=Kimberly |last=Geiger |deadurl=yes |date=October 25, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523163140/http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/NATIONAL-STATUARY-HALL-Debate-urged-on-Starr-2548900.php |archivedate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also went on to observe that King was not a native of the state though, of course, neither is Reagan (nor was [[Junipero Serra]], the other statue representing California in Statuary Hall).

As a result of this resolution, King's statue was removed from Statuary Hall, and the statue of Ronald Reagan was placed in Statuary Hall on June 10, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/23261.html| title=Congress honors Ronald Reagan with figure in Statuary Hall| last1=Lovely| first1=Erika| last2=Martin| first2=Jonathan| work=[[Politico]]| date=June 3, 2009| accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, Starr King's statue was reinstalled within the Civil War Memorial Grove in Capitol Park, which surrounds the [[California State Capitol]] in [[Sacramento]].  It was formally dedicated in a ceremony held on December 8, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/21/local/la-me-beliefs21-2009dec21|title=A giant of California history returns to Sacramento| date=December 21, 2009| first=Gerrick D. |last=Kennedy| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]], '''Thor''' ('''Thorlief Golmen''') is a fictional [[superhero]] based on the [[Marvel Universe]] version of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Thor is the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] God of Thunder based on the [[Thor|deity of the same name]] of [[Norse mythology]] and a founding member of the [[Ultimates]].

Thor was adapted from [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]'s comic book version of Thor by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Bryan Hitch]], first appearing in ''[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]''. "Ultimate Thor" is the alter-ego of Thorlief Golmen, an anarchist who discovered he is the reincarnated form of the Norse warrior Thor. The "Ultimate" redesign of the character reduces the number of Thor's powers, and reduces the character's reliance upon his hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], as a source of power. Perhaps most significantly, the Thunder God's long-established personality is drastically altered, changing him from an eager and willing divine combatant into an [[ecocentrism|ecocentric]], arguably unstable, and somewhat reluctant warrior.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Ultimate Thor was once a [[Psychiatric and mental health nursing|psychiatric nurse]] called Thorlief Golmen until suffering a nervous breakdown before his 30th birthday. During the 18 months he spent institutionalized, he claims to have realized who he is and why he has been sent to Earth.  He claimed to be Thor, Norse god of thunder, on a mission to save the planet and to stop the "war to end all wars". Thor himself claims to have known who he was since he was twelve years old, and that his nervous breakdown only brought him further clarity. His political and social activism, as well as his own self-help books, attracted rebellious hippies and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]]. He spoke against [[United States|America]]'s military aggression towards other world powers and the [[military-industrial complex]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Ultimates'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Ultimates'' vol.2, #4-6&lt;/ref&gt;

His background is made less clear due to his brother Loki's reality manipulations,&lt;ref&gt;''The Ultimates'' vol.2 #4-13&lt;/ref&gt; and later stories try to reconcile this history with the existence of Asgard.&lt;ref&gt;Ultimate Comics: Thor #1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ultimates''===
In ''[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]'', when General [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] contacted Thor about joining the [[Ultimates]], Thor refused to work for the [[military-industrial complex]] that he detests.  When the [[Ultimate Hulk|Hulk]] appeared in [[Manhattan]], Thor refused to assist unless the [[President of the United States|President]] doubled the foreign aid budget. Not long after the Ultimates confronted the Hulk, the President relented and Thor appeared in time to save [[Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]] from Banner. Following the battle, Thor became good friends with [[Ultimate Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and Steve Rogers, pledging his support whenever lives are in danger. Over dinner, he explains to Stark and Rogers his origins and insists that he is the genuine article. Soon thereafter, Thor was briefed on the [[Chitauri]] and sent to investigate a suspected Chitauri base in [[Micronesia]]. They were saved by Iron Man's force field after they discovered the base abandoned and ready to explode. Once a Chitauri fleet appeared in [[Arizona]], Thor brought the survivors there. He and Iron Man then provided air support against the Chitauri spacecraft until the Air Force arrived. After Iron Man asked Thor to help him dispose of the Chitauri bomb that would obliterate the entire [[solar system]], Thor teleported it to the wastes of [[Náströnd]], a deserted world in the [[Norse cosmology|Asgardian cosmos]] where its detonation caused only a small ripple in our [[space-time]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Ultimates'' #1-13&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ultimate War''===
In ''[[Ultimate War]]'', Thor appears as a member of the Ultimates, retrieving the dead with Iron Man after the attack in issue one. When [[Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]] attacks the Ultimates, he says he is surprised to see Thor with the Ultimates, and asks him if he thinks he can change them. Thor throws Mjolnir at the Master of Magnetism, but Magneto manages to stop it an inch from his helmet and throws it back at Thor, sending him through a wall. Thor joins the Ultimates in attacking the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] later on; he fought [[Ultimate Storm|Storm]] but is defeated by [[Ultimate Colossus|Colossus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/universe/Thor_%28Ultimate%29 |title=Thor (Ultimate)|publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ultimate Six''===
In ''[[Ultimate Six]]'', Thor appears with the Ultimates while bringing in [[Kraven the Hunter#Ultimate Marvel|Kraven the Hunter]], although he refuses Captain America's requests to catch Kraven or bring him back. He is seen aiding in reconstruction efforts in Bosnia when summoned following the Six's breakout. Thor is the one who defeats [[Ultimate Electro|Electro]] during the climactic battle at the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Six'' #1-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ultimate Secret''===
In ''[[Ultimate Secret]]'', Thor and Iron Man escort the Fantastic Four to Nevada. When the Kree attack the base, Thor, Black Widow, Johnny Storm, and The Thing fight off the aliens. As he is idolized by Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm, he fraternizes with them to the point of ordering [[Carol Danvers#Ultimate Carol Danvers|Carol Danvers]] to prepare a keg of beer for after the battle.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Secret'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ultimate Fantastic Four''===
Thor has appeared or been mentioned in several storylines of the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]. [[Ultimate Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] at one point created infant hard light versions of the Ultimates and thought Thor to be the most powerful superhuman on the planet. This was proved wrong when [[Ultimate Namor|Namor]] appeared to be physically stronger. In another storyline an interdimensional parasite that sought out the most powerful being on the planet bypassed a present Thor and possessed [[Alternative versions of Doctor Doom#Ultimate Marvel|Doctor Doom]]. This is attributed to a combination of Doom’s physical states and knowledge of Atlantean magic.

Thor appeared as a minor character in an alternate timeline as the [[President of the United States]] due to time travel involving Skrull invaders. In it his powers were described as “natural.” This alternate version was killed during the Skrull invasion and ceased to exist when the timeline was erased.

Thor appeared in a later storyline involving [[Thanos]]. He stated he had fought Thanos in the past and tried to fight him again along with the rest of the Ultimates. He was quickly defeated due to Thanos possessing the [[Cosmic Cube]] and turned into a tree. This was undone when Thanos was defeated by the Fantastic Four.

===''Ultimates 2''===
In ''[[The Ultimates 2|Ultimates 2]]'' Thor has resigned from the Ultimates due to his belief that the team has become a tool for American foreign policy. In a restaurant, he meets fellow Asgardian [[Volstagg]], also reincarnated as a human being, who warns him his half-brother [[Loki (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Gunnar Golmen/Loki]] has escaped and is shifting reality on Earth to strike at Thor. Volstagg is then erased from reality making it look like Thor is delusional. After Bruce Banner’s identity of the Hulk is leaked to the public, Captain America accuses Thor of the act, but Thor denies the charge and tries to warn Captain America of Loki's influence, but his warnings are rejected as are his claims to be Thor. An anti-super-soldier demonstration in Italy turns violent due to Loki’s interference. When Thor intervenes on behalf of the protesters, the incident is used as an excuse for the Ultimates to team with the European Defence Initiative’s super-soldiers to arrest him. The EDI’s head scientist, Gunnar Golmen, reveals that Thor’s powers are technological in nature, coming from his belt and hammer. Gunnar explains that Thor is really his own mentally troubled brother who stole the equipment and has been being acting as [[Thor|Thor, God of Thunder]], ever since. Gunnar claims the equipment gives Thor physical strength and powers beyond anyone else on the planet, and that he is too dangerous to take on alone.

Thor is tracked to Norway. After he fails to convince the Ultimates that Gunnar is really a masquerading Loki manipulating reality, a battle ensues. Despite initially holding his own, Thor is eventually overwhelmed and has to call upon a storm.  At the last moment, [[Quicksilver (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Quicksilver]] is able to remove his belt stripping Thor of his powers and his ability to use Mjolnir. Thor is then locked up in the Triskelion all the time being mocked by Loki, who is invisible to all but him and attempts to convince him that he is insane.

Thor is imprisoned in the Triskelion until the last issue of the series, where his attempts to warn the Ultimates about the coming dangers are ignored. Following the Liberators' conquest of America, Thor is freed by [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] (this is helped by [[Scarlet Witch#Ultimate Marvel|Scarlet Witch]] using her mutant hex power to effect the probability of Thor regaining his power) and restored to full power in time to battle a revealed Loki.  At first Loki has the upper hand by using his powers over reality to become immune to Thor’s hammer and overpowering the thunder god while summoning an army of Asgardian monsters to kill the Ultimates.  After an army of Asgardian warriors arrive to fight the monsters, Loki’s powers stop working for unknown reasons.  During the battle Loki reveals he is responsible for creating the idea of a Norwegian super-soldier program and framing Captain America.  Thor is able to destroy Loki’s mortal form and send his spirit back to Odin for punishment.  Now vindicated in his claims of godhood, Thor learns that the Ultimates will no longer be working for the government, and rejoins the team.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimates 2'' #1-13&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ultimate Power''===
In ''[[Ultimate Power]]'', Thor appears alongside the rest of the new Ultimates alongside Nick Fury arriving to battle the [[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Squadron Supreme]] when they destroy the roof of the [[Baxter Building]]. After the battle Thor used his hammer to teleport the [[Helicarrier]] with the team to the Supremeverse. There he engages [[Supreme Power Hyperion|Hyperion]] in combat, but is defeated by the former's superior speed.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Power'' #1-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Ultimate Power'' #7 Thor gains the upper hand against [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]], felling him with a huge bolt of lightning then severely beating him with Mjolnir. He also knocks back [[Power Princess|Zarda]] as she attempts to stop him from beating Hyperion.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Power'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ultimates 3''===
In ''[[The Ultimates 3|Ultimates 3]]'' Thor undergoes many changes making him closer to his mainstream counterpart.  He is redesigned with a beard and a bulkier build.  He becomes much more eager for battle and more vengeful.   His ax/hammer is replaced with one closer to the mainstream version of [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] in look.  He has formed a romantic relationship with [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Valkyrie|Valkyrie]], who has mysteriously gained superhuman powers.  He starts speaking in a Shakespearean pattern, claiming it is the way he truly speaks and with his godhood no longer in doubt feels he no longer has to hide it. During the course of the story he reveals he has a collection of weapons which were a gift from Odin forged by [[Ulik|Ulik the troll]]. The ax/hammer weapon is among them.

During the course of the story Thor aids the team when the [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Ultimate Brotherhood|Brotherhood of Mutants]] attacks their mansion.  He later travels to the [[Savage Land]] with the Ultimates to confront Magneto.  He once again battles Magneto, but is quickly defeated and buried near the center of the Earth.  After the true mastermind behind the events is revealed, Thor attempts to confront Magneto again, but Magneto uses his powers to take Thor's hammer from him and then leaves.  Following this, Thor begins using a sword.

Donald Blake also appeared in the first issue of the series as the doctor who attempted to revive the Scarlet Witch after she was shot. Blake was never seen again in the series; however he later would appear in ''Ultimate Thor'' where he is revealed to be Balder, Thor and Loki's brother and Odin's eyes and ears, revived in human form after being murdered by Loki.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimates 3'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ultimatum''===
As mentioned, Magneto uses Thor's hammer to create worldwide destruction. During these events Thor, upon finding Valkyrie's lifeless body, enters [[Valhalla]] to reclaim her soul. He is then confronted by [[Hela (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Hela]], who forces Thor to battle Hela's army of fallen warriors to reach Valkyrie. Captain America suddenly appears in Valhalla, implying that he has died. In Valhalla, Thor sacrifices himself to save Valkyrie and Captain America from Hela and this allows them to go back to live.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimatum'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===''New Ultimates''===
In ''New Ultimates'' #1 he is shown still imprisoned, demanding Hela returns him to Earth and to Valkyrie. She tells him she will give him whatever his heart desires in exchange for a son. The next issue has a vision shown to Valkyrie by Amora where he is making love with Hela as he had no other choice. Later Hela tells him that another soul is still needed for him to leave, Thor says it will be hers but finds himself unable to kill her because she is already pregnant. At the end of the issue he is resurrected at the price of the death of Valkyrie. Thor then goes into a rage searching for his brother and attacking the Ultimates in the process until he finally finds him and gets his hammer back with the Ultimates watching as he is still extremely angry.&lt;ref&gt;''New Ultimates'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ultimate Comics: Avengers vs. New Ultimates''===
Thor remained in the Ultimates when they were employed by Carol Danvers and battled Nick Fury's black-ops team codenamed the Avengers. At this point, Thor was back in a relationship with [[Jane Foster (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Jane Foster]] and shared an apartment with her and began to talk like a "normal person" again when Tony Stark promised to donate money to charity if Thor gave up his Asgardian "faux-Shakespearean" speech-pattern. In the final battle during the revolution in North Korea organised by Gregory Stark, Thor and the Ultimates battled Gregory, whose superpowered suit made him too powerful to defeat until Iron Man disabled it with an electromagnetic pulse, giving Thor the opportunity to kill Gregory on the spot with a lightning bolt.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man''===
Thor's return and rejoining into the Ultimates was confirmed in the pages of ''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'', where he is seen as one of the Ultimates. Director Danvers asks his advice, and one of the Ultimates who will teach Spider-Man to be a hero. He is later shown attending Peter Parker's funeral, where he reflects that he has also seen Peter dining in Valhalla with the deceased X-Men and Ultimates members.

===''Ultimate Comics: Thor''===
''Ultimate Comics: Thor'' reveals Thor's personal history from Asgard and prior to the events of The Ultimates. Eons ago, Thor resided in Asgard along with his brothers Balder and Loki, and under the rule of King Odin. Odin foresees that Asgard will soon fall and  chooses Thor to champion the ways of Asgard after that event. The hammer Mjolnir is crafted to contain the power of Asgard, and Thor is the only one who is able to wield the weapon. After murdering Balder and stealing the sacred [[Norn Stones]], Loki relocates to Earth. There, he aligns himself with the Nazis in World War 2 in the guise of Baron Zemo. Loki uses the stones to return to Asgard, armed with an army of Frost Giants and Nazi soldiers. In the ensuing battle, Odin transports Loki to the Room with No Doors, but is subsequently killed by a Frost Giant named Mammoth. While Asgard dematerializes, Thor delivers one last powerful blow against the invaders.

In modern-day Earth, Thor is shown to be the subject of the European Super Soldier program. His powers are shown to be a function of the program, designed by the E.S.S. to imitate Norse iconography with Thor as the super-soldier symbol of Norway, but the project meets an unexpected stumbling block when Thor's claims of being the human incarnation of a Norse God leads the scientists in charge of the program to believe that he is insane. Psychiatrist Dr. Donald Blake is later revealed to be the reborn Balder and tells the scientists that his examination suggests that Thor is who he says he is. Balder tells Thor that, despite Ragnarok destroying Asgard, the Gods live on in the hearts of mortals and are yet to be reawakened. This, in addition to the financial costs that went into the super soldier program, convinces the scientists to complete the work that turns Thor into a super soldier. He is given a suit designed to heighten his strength significantly, leaving him practically unbeatable, along with being equipped with a weather-manipulation device which allows him to control weather and teleport across space. When the scientist face difficulty in handling the size of the machine, Thor tells them to make it the head of his new ax-hammer.

Once allowed into the open, Thor works on a number of humanitarian projects, and rejects offers from General Nick Fury to join the [[Ultimates]]. Meanwhile, Loki escapes from the Room with No Doors and returns to Earth. Balder convinces Thor to take up his responsibility as a hero as Thor joins the Ultimates in subduing the [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Ultimate Marvel|Hulk]]. Despite his pacifist ideals, Thor promises to "bring the Thunder" against "men who make war".&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: Thor'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates''===
Reed Richards returned to Earth and founded an organization called Children of Tomorrow, a group of evolved humans with the aim of dominating the world, building their base called the Dome. The Dome's interior ages at an accelerated rate compared to the outside world. Over 900 years have passed inside the Dome, so their inhabitants [[directed evolution|evolved themselves]] to perfect super-humans. The EUSS attacked the Dome with Captain Britain, Captain Spain and Captain France along with Thor. The heroes were subdued by the enemies and some of them were killed, draining their powers. After examining Thor, Richards, now called the Maker, sent the Children for the source of power of Thor, leading them to Asgard. After killing every Asgardian God, the Children drained the power of Yggdrasil, leaving Thor powerless. After Iron Man rescued Thor, he provided Odinson with an upgraded version of his Super-Soldier armor, with which Thor teleported to the Dome in search of vengeance. There, he rescued Captain Britain, but was defeated by the Children, and the Maker showed himself as Reed Richards, with the condition of deliver that message. Also, a new ability emerged to Thor, being the last Asgardian alive, he apparently "became" Valhalla, being able to see the ghost of the dead Asgardians, such as Odin, Loki, and others, who apparently also acts as his awareness, helping him. Following these events, Thor moved into Stark Tower with Jane Foster.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #1-6&lt;/ref&gt; Thor was present with Stark when the Ultimates were labelled as outlaws accompanied him when Stark detailed his plans of how to defeat Reed Richards to the new President of the United States. He easily defeated the Hulk, who was brainwashed by the Maker and injected with a Giant-Man serum.

Thor later battles his son, Modi, who has tried to conquer the United States with the help of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]. Thor is forced to kill Modi, and is left to mourn his son, as well as rue his own failures as a father.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics Ultimates'' #13-18&lt;/ref&gt;

When Reed Richards and his Dark Ultimates destroy the Triskellion, Thor leaves to drown his sorrows at a small bar in Arizona. Bruce Banner tracks Thor down and transforms into the Hulk, leading to a rematch between the two. Thor is defeated and imprisoned, but is later freed alongside the rest of his teammates. Iron Man also creates a new hammer and suit of armor for Thor by using Reed's future technology.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #25-30&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Earth-616 version of [[Galactus]] attacks the Ultimate Earth, Thor is among those to challenge the entity. During the final battle, Thor sacrifices himself in order to drive Galactus into the [[Negative Zone]], trapping them both.&lt;ref&gt;''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Secret Wars''===
After the destruction of both the Earth-616 and Ultimate universes, Thor is among those rescued by [[Doctor Doom|God Doom]] and transported to [[Battleworld]]. Now known as Thunderer Thorlief (nicknamed "Ultimate Thor"), he begins investigating the murderers of various men and women who all turn out to be alternate universe versions of Donald Blake and Jane Foster. Ultimate Thor discovers that the murders were committed by Rune Thor, who had been tasked by God Doom with eliminating the various versions of Donald and Jane in order to keep the Thor Corps from remembering that the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]] once existed before Battleworld. Ultimate Thor and the other members of the Thor Corps storm Doom's castle, where they are all killed.

After his death, Ultimate Thor's hammer is shown to have landed on the Earth-616 version of Asgard.&lt;ref&gt;''Thors'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Unworthy Thor''===
Sometime later, the hammer is shown to be on a mysterious space ship, in front of an imprisoned Thor Odinson.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mighty Thor'' Vol. 5 #5&lt;/ref&gt;  This is later revealed to be the ship of the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] who wants to possess the hammer for himself, and has obtained the ruins of Asgard to this end.  Currently, the Collector is being challenged for possession of this hammer by [[Thanos]]' [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], as well as a team-up of Odinson, Toothgnasher (one of his magical goats), "Thori" (a Hellhound previously owned by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]), and [[Beta Ray Bill]]. Although able to channel its power when in proximity, Odinson chooses not to claim the hammer, but he and Bill use the power of the hammer to return Asgard to its rightful place while decimating the Collector's forces. &lt;ref&gt;''The Unworthy Thor'' #2-5 (2016-2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mighty Thor (2015 series)===
This hammer is subsequently claimed by [[Volstagg]], after he witnesses the brutal demise of several children in a conflict with Surtur's forces. This transforms Volstagg into the War Thor.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mighty Thor'' #20 (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the hammer gets destroyed in a battle with the [[Mangog]].&lt;ref&gt; ''The Mighty Thor'' #701 (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avengers A.I.===
This hammer is also seen in one alternate future wielded by synthezoid [[Victor Mancha]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers A.I. #10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Thor possesses immense superhuman strength, stamina, and durability. At the beginning of the series, his physical powers were entirely dependent on his belt because he had no access to his divine powers. After being restored by Odin, however, it is unclear if the belt boosts his powers or, in fact, serves any purpose at all.

Thor possesses the ability to control the weather on a large scale. He is capable of summoning thunderstorms and controlling massive amounts of lightning.  He can teleport across space and between dimensions. It is unknown to what extent he relies on his weapons for these abilities. It is also unknown if Thor can control other types of weather. Both variations of his hammer are capable of these powers.

Thor possesses some skill at combat. He is depicted with an armory of weapons ranging from different types of hammers to swords and daggers. However, the ax/hammer hybrid primarily wielded by the character is considered to be the "Ultimate" version of [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], as revealed in ''[[Ultimate Power]]'' #9. But, in the ''[[Ultimate Comics: Thor|Ultimate Thor]]'' miniseries it is revealed that the hammer resembling the Earth-616 version was his weapon when he was a god, and was lost during Ragnarok. When he is reincarnated as Thorleif Golmen, he is given tech-based armour and a portable power supply that gives him his superhuman powers, which is turned into the recognisable axe-hammer from ''The Ultimates''.

Starting in ''The Ultimates 3'', Thor no longer wears the belt or uses the axe-hammer, and instead uses the "true" Mjolnir. When the Children of Tomorrow drain the Odinforce and exterminate the Asgardian race, Thor is stripped of his godly powers and gives his square hammer to his son Modi before pushing him into the World Tree. From then, he uses the belt and axe-hammer he wielded before, now more powerful due to advancements made by Tony Stark.

Even after Thor's 'death' after the Incursions, his hammer survived the destruction of the multiverse and landed on Asgard. When the currently-unworthy Odinson of Earth-616 came in close proximity of it, he experienced brief flashes of Ultimate Thor's life, even sensing that the hammer was in some way searching for its true master, and was able to channel the hammer's control of the lightning despite not being its master or worthy of his own hammer at this point.

==In other media==
*Ultimate Thor appears in the two animated films ''[[Ultimate Avengers|Ultimate Avengers: The Movie]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Avengers 2]]'' (which are loosely adapted from ''The Ultimates''), voiced by [[Dave Boat]]. Thor undergoes some differences to make him resemble the [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|original Thor]] created by [[Stan Lee]]. His costume and hammer remain unchanged from ''The Ultimates'', though he is clean-shaven and has on-screen conferences with Odin. His speech is formal and stilted. Mjöllnir is shown to have the worthiness test similar to the classic Thor, but the Hulk is shown to be able to lift the hammer with great physical effort. In ''Ultimate Avengers'', Thor's onscreen time is considerably smaller than the appearances of the other heroes. He first appears with a group of environmental protesters when Nick Fury and Captain America approach him to join the Avengers, which he harshly refuses. He appears in the climax of the film in time to help defeat the Chitauri fleet and the Hulk. In ''Ultimate Avengers 2'', he overcomes a predicament (which he foresees in a vision) involving the deaths of the Avengers at the hands of the Chitauri invasion force. He disobeys Odin's demand that he returns to Asgard and stops interfering with the affairs of man. He aids the team in fighting the worldwide invasion and confirms his claims to be the God of Thunder by reviving Iron Man, who is near death at this point. He appears at the memorial for the deceased Giant Man.

*The [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] version of Thor borrows certain elements of costume and personality from the Ultimate version.

[[File:Nosadella Tiestes y Aérope.jpg|thumb]]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Thyestes''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|θ|aɪ|ˈ|ɛ|s|t|iː|z|}}, {{lang-gr|Θυέστης}}, {{IPA-el|tʰyéstɛːs|}}) was a king of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Thyestes and his brother, [[Atreus]], were exiled by their father for having murdered their half-brother, [[Chrysippus (mythology)|Chrysippus]], in their desire for the throne of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. They took refuge in [[Mycenae]], where they ascended the throne upon the absence of King [[Eurystheus]], who was fighting the [[Heracleidae]]. Eurystheus had meant for their lordship to be temporary; it became permanent because of his death in conflict. 

The most popular representation of Thyestes is that of the play ''Thyestes'' by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] in 62 AD. This play is one of the originals for the revenge tragedy genre. Although inspired by Greek mythology and legend, Seneca's version is different.

__TOC__

== Family ==
Thyestes was the son of [[Pelops]] and [[Hippodamia]], and father of [[Pelopia (daughter of Thyestes)|Pelopia]] and [[Aegisthus]]. His three sons by a [[naiad]] who was killed by Atreus were named Aglaus, [[Orchomenus (mythology)|Orchomenus]] and Calaeus.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tzetzes]]. ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/TzetzesChiliades1.html#18 Chiliades, 1.18 line 449]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Myth ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
[[Pelops]] and [[Hippodamia]] are parents to Thyestes. However, they were cursed by [[Myrtilus]], a servant of King [[Oenomaus]], the father of Hippodamia. Myrtilus was promised the right to Hippodamia's virginity and half of Pelops' kingdom, but Pelops denied both to him and killed him by throwing him into the sea. With his dying gasp, Myrtilus cursed their line, which is where Thyestes and Atreus comes in.

Thyestes' brother and King of Mycenae, [[Atreus]], vowed to sacrifice his best lamb to [[Artemis]]. Upon searching his flock, however, Atreus discovered a golden lamb which he gave to his wife, [[Aerope]], to hide from the goddess. She gave it to her lover, Thyestes, who then convinced Atreus to agree that whoever had the lamb should be king. Thyestes produced the lamb and claimed the throne.

Atreus retook the throne using advice he received from [[Hermes]]. Thyestes agreed to give the kingdom back when the sun moved backwards in the sky, a feat that [[Zeus]] accomplished. Atreus retook the throne and banished Thyestes.

Atreus then learned of Thyestes' and Aerope's adultery and plotted revenge. He killed Thyestes' sons and cooked them, save their hands and heads. He served Thyestes his own sons and then taunted him with their hands and heads. This is the source of modern phrase "Thyestean Feast," or one at which human flesh is served. When Thyestes was done with his feast, he released a loud belch, which represents satiety and pleasure and his loss of self-control.

An oracle then advised Thyestes that, if he had a son with his own daughter [[Pelopia]], that son would kill Atreus. Thyestes did so by raping Pelopia (his identity hidden from her) and the son, [[Aegisthus]], did kill Atreus. However, when Aegisthus was first born, he was abandoned by his mother, ashamed of the origin of her son. A shepherd found the infant Aegisthus and gave him to Atreus, who raised him as his own son. Only as he entered adulthood did Thyestes reveal the truth to Aegisthus, that he was both father and grandfather to the boy and that Atreus was his uncle. Aegisthus then killed Atreus.

While Thyestes ruled Mycenae, the sons of Atreus, [[Agamemnon]] and [[Menelaus]], were exiled to Sparta. There, King [[Tyndareus]] accepted them as the royalty that they were. Shortly after, he helped the brothers return to Mycenae to overthrow Thyestes, forcing him to live in Cytheria, where he died.

===Legacy===
As a token of good will and allegiance, King Tyndareus offered his daughters to Agamemnon and Menelaus as wives, [[Clytemnestra]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] respectively.

When Agamemnon left Mycenae for the [[Trojan War]], Aegisthus seduced Agamemnon's wife, [[Clytemnestra]], and the couple plotted to kill her husband upon his return. They succeeded, killing Agamemnon and his new concubine, [[Cassandra]]. Clytemnestra and Aegisthus had three children: [[Aletes (son of Aegisthus)|Aletes]], [[Erigone (daughter of Aegisthus)|Erigone]], and Helen who died as an infant.

Seven or eight years after the death of Agamemnon, Agamemnon's son [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] returned to Mycenae and, with the help of his cousin [[Pylades]] and his sister [[Electra]], killed both their mother, Clytemnestra, and Aegisthus.

Tired of the bloodshed, the gods exonerated Orestes and declared this the end of the curse on the house of Atreus, as described in [[Aeschylus]]' [[Drama#Classical Athenian drama|play]] ''[[The Eumenides]]''.

However, other stories say that when Aletes and Erigone came of age and became rulers at Mycenae, Orestes returned with an army then killed his half-brother and raped his half-sister, who gave birth to a son, [[Penthilus]].

==Theatre==
{{see|Thyestes (Seneca)}}

In the first century AD, [[Seneca the Younger]] wrote a tragedy called ''[[Thyestes (Seneca)|Thyestes]]''. In 1560 [[Jasper Heywood]], then a Fellow of [[All Souls College]], [[Oxford]], published a [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] [[translation]]. [[Shakespeare]]'s tragedy ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' derives some of its plot elements from the story of Thyestes. In 1681, [[John Crowne]] wrote ''Thyestes, A Tragedy'', based closely on Seneca's Thyestes, but with the incongruous addition of a love story. Prosper Jolyot Crebillon  (1674-1762) wrote a tragedy "Atree et Thyeste" (1707), which is prominent in two tales of ratiocination by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. In 1796, [[Ugo Foscolo]] (1778–1827) wrote a tragedy called ''Tieste'' that was first presented in [[Venice]] one year later. [[Caryl Churchill]], a British dramatist, also wrote a rendition of ''Thyestes.'' Churchill's specific translation was performed at the Royal Court Theater Upstairs in London on June 7, 1994&lt;ref&gt;Seneca; Churchill, Caryl. Thyestes. : Nick Hern Books, 2014. Ebook Library. Web. 21 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Jan van Vlijmen]] (1935–2004) completed his opera ''Thyeste''. The [[libretto]] was a text in French by [[Hugo Claus]], based on his 20th century play with the same title (in Dutch: ''Thyestes''). Thyestes appears in [[Ford Ainsworth]]'s one-act play, ''Persephone''.

==Influence in literature==
Seneca's influence in literature is reflected through other works.  In Arnold's Sonnet on Shakespeare, the influence of Seneca is apparent.  "The reminiscence of Atreus’ speech in the ''Thyestes'' of Seneca, which might subtend Cleopatra's own passionate, distended rhetoric about Antony" (Edgecombe, 257).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Edgecombe, Rodney Stenning. "A Debt To Seneca In Arnold's Sonnet On Shakespeare." ''Notes And Queries'' 60.2 (2013): 258. ''Print.''

'''Dennis Posa''', aka '''Dennis Parker''', better known by his performance name of '''Wade Nichols''', (October 28, 1946 &amp;ndash; January 28, 1985), was an [[actor]] and singer who started his career in adult films.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|nm0629754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="variety2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Variety Magazine (daily)|date=16 September 1985|edition=September 16, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life ==
Nichols was born in [[Manhattan, New York]], and raised in [[Freeport, New York]].&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite book|title=Variety Magazine (weekly)|date=6 February 1985|edition=February 6, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Philadelphia Museum College of Art]], studying Furniture Design.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RTD"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Durdan |first1=Douglas |title=Sons on a soap, but not here |url=https://www.genealogybank.com/nbshare/AC01160630032403148881531720061 |accessdate=16 July 2018 |publisher=Richmond Times Dispatch |date=24 July 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; While attending, he won a role in a touring company production of ''[[The Trojan Women]]''.  He later attended [[New York University]] and the [[Herbert Berghof Studio]], where he studied acting.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; He supported himself by working as a carpenter for several years.&lt;ref name="RTD"/&gt;

==Career==
Nichols' first feature film role was probably in the [[gay pornography|gay adult film]] ''Boynapped!'' (1975). He subsequently appeared mostly in straight porn films shot in New York, such as ''[[Barbara Broadcast]]'', ''Blonde Ambition'', ''Jail Bait,'' [[Maraschino Cherry (film)|''Maraschino Cherry'']], ''Punk Rock,'' ''Summer of Laura'', ''Take Off'', and ''Teenage Pajama Party.''&lt;ref name="variety2"/&gt; Posa was credited as Wade Nichols in most of the adult films in which he appeared.

In 1979, using the name Dennis Parker, he recorded a [[disco]] album on [[Casablanca Records]] entitled ''Like an Eagle''.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RTD"/&gt; The album was produced by [[Village People]] creator and producer [[Jacques Morali]] who was Nichols' boyfriend at the time&lt;ref name=Nichols&gt;[http://www.therialtoreport.com/2017/06/25/wade-nichols/ Wade Nichols: ‘A Galaxy of Pleasure and Pain’ – His Untold Story], profile of Wade Nichols, [http://www.therialtoreport.com/ The Rialto Report], June 25, 2017"&lt;/ref&gt;. He also toured Europe to promote the album.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; He later appeared in the French film ''Monique'' that same year, with ''Like an Eagle'' being used as its theme song. The title track was released as a single and appears on the box set ''The Casablanca Records Story'' (1994).

Posa (still as Dennis Parker) joined the cast of the [[soap opera]] ''[[The Edge of Night]]'' in 1979, as Police Chief Derek Mallory.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RTD"/&gt;

Seriously ill by October 1984, Posa was unable to continue working on ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', and his character was written out of the show. The show was cancelled months later.

==Death==
Parker died January 28, 1985.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; In a tribute to Parker in a 1985 issue of ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'', fellow ''Edge of Night'' actor [[Ernie Townsend]] wrote, "He died in early January after a long and painful illness that took away a talent in its prime."{{cn|date=June 2017}} An obituary released in Virginia stated that he died after a "brief illness, survived by his mother, brother, and partner."{{cn|date=June 2017}}
