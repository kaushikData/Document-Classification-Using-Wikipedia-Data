'''''Bragdon v. Abbott''''', 524 U.S. 624 (1998), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that reproduction does qualify as a major life activity according to the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA).&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Bragdon v. Abbott|volume=524|page=624|pin=|year=1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Sidney Abbott, after disclosing on a form that she was 'asymptomatic' [[HIV]] positive, was refused service from her [[dentist]], Randon Bragdon, to fill a cavity.  Bragdon submitted that he would agree to fill the cavity if he could perform the work in a hospital setting, but that Abbott would have to pay for the expense of being admitted and using the facility.  Abbott sued Bragdon on grounds of discrimination, citing the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]].  The case was appealed through the court system and eventually was agreed to be heard by the Supreme Court.  Abbott’s case was based on the argument that she was a victim of discrimination based on the ADA.  Abbott argued that HIV created a “substantial limitation” to life activities, specifically, reproductive ability.  Bragdon, the [[defendant]], retorted that HIV posed a “direct threat” to his health and safety, but that he was willing to work on Abbott should he be able to take “extra precautions” in a hospital setting.  Federal trial courts, as well as appellate courts ruled in favor of Abbott.

== Issue ==
The major issues that were heard and decided upon by the Supreme Court included:  whether HIV is a disability and reproduction a major life activity under the ADA.  Accordingly, can a [[physician]] refuse or alter care of a patient with HIV without violating portions of the ADA?

== Decision  ==
The United States Supreme Court ruled that reproduction does qualify as a major life activity under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA), and that even asymptomatic HIV would qualify Abbott to claim protection under the act.  The Court held that the ADA does not force care-givers to treat those who pose a direct threat and that health care professionals may not be granted deference to their views when serving as a defendant in cases of alleged discrimination.  The holding does not effect a blanket protection under the ADA to all persons with HIV.

== Reason ==
The Court utilized the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which aimed to eliminate discrimination towards people with disabilities in the workplace, public areas and by government entities.  That includes discrimination towards people with actual disabilities and persons who are regarded or treated as if they have a disability.  Specific to the case, the ADA stipulates that those with disabilities cannot be discriminated against medical treatment. In order to receive protection from the ADA, Abbott was required to show that she had an impairment, and that it substantially limited a major life activity, on which the Court sided with her claim.

'''Brunner syndrome''' is a rare [[genetic disorder]] associated with a [[mutation]] in the [[MAOA gene]]. It is characterized by lower than average IQ (typically about 85), problematic [[impulsive behavior]] (such as [[arson]], [[hypersexuality]] and violence), sleep disorders and mood swings.&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hunter P |title=The psycho gene |journal=EMBO Rep. |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=667–9 |date=September 2010 |pmid=20805840 |pmc=2933872 |doi=10.1038/embor.2010.122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OMIM|300615}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was identified in fourteen males from one family in 1993.&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt;&lt;ref name=BrunnerAJHG&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brunner HG |author2=Nelen MR |author3=van Zandvoort P |author4=Abeling NGGM |author5=van Gennip AH |author6=Wolters EC |author7=Kuiper MA |author8=Ropers HH |author9=van Oost BA |title=X-linked borderline mental retardation with prominent behavioral disturbance: phenotype, genetic localization, and evidence for disturbed monoamine metabolism |journal=Am.

==Causes==
Brunner syndrome is caused by a [[monoamine oxidase A]] (MAOA) deficiency, which leads to an excess of [[monoamines]] in the brain, such as [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], and [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline). In both mice and humans, a mutation was located on the eighth exon of the MAO-A gene, which created a dysfunctional MAO-A gene.&lt;ref name=Brunner /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=AL|author2=Bortolato, M|author3=Chen, K|author4=Shih, JC|title=Novel monoamine oxidase A knock out mice with human-like spontaneous mutation.|journal=NeuroReport|date=2008-05-07|volume=19|issue=7|pages=739–43|pmid=18418249|doi=10.1097/WNR.0b013e3282fd6e88|pmc=3435113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regular function of MAO-A, breaking down monoamines, is disrupted, and monoamines build up within the brain. Mice that lacked a functional MAO-A gene displayed higher levels of aggression, in comparison to mice with a functional MAO-A gene.&lt;ref name=Scott /&gt;
==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=July 2017}}
==Treatment==
Progesterone &amp; Rauwolfia Serpentina (containing Reserpine) are a possible treatment as they both increase MAO-A activity.

==History==
Brunner Syndrome was described in 1993 by H.G. Brunner and his colleagues upon the discovery of a particular genetic defect in male members of a large Dutch family.&lt;ref name=Brunner&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brunner HG, Nelen M, Breakefield XO, Ropers HH, van Oost BA |title=Abnormal behavior associated with a point mutation in the structural gene for monoamine oxidase A |journal=Science |volume=262 |issue=5133 |pages=578–80 |date=October 1993 |pmid=8211186 |doi= 10.1126/science.8211186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunner found that all of the male family members with this defect reacted aggressively when angry, fearful, or frustrated. The defect discovered was later found to be a mutation in the gene that codes for monoamine oxidase A ([[MAOA gene]]).&lt;ref name=Brunner/&gt;  Brunner said that an "MAO-A deficiency is associated with a recognizable behavioural phenotype that included disturbed regulation of impulsive aggression".&lt;ref name=Brunner /&gt;

A letter published by Hebebrand and Klug (1995)&lt;ref name=HK&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hebebrand J, Klug B |title=Specification of the phenotype required for men with monoamine oxidase type A deficiency |journal=Hum. Genet. |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=372–6 |date=September 1995 |pmid=7649563 |doi=10.1007/BF00210430}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticized Brunner's findings for not using strict DSM criteria.

==Society and culture==
Brunner's findings have been used to argue that genetics, rather than decision-making processes, can cause criminal activity.&lt;ref name=Halwani&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halwani S, Krupp DB |title=The genetic defence: the impact of genetics on the concept of criminal responsibility |journal=Health Law J |volume=12 |issue= |pages=35–70 |year=2004 |pmid=16539076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence supporting the genetic defense stems from both Brunner's findings and a series of studies on mice.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt; To prove the correlation between MAO-A deficiency and aggression in courts, it is often contended that individuals cannot be held accountable for their genes, and as a result, should not be held responsible for their dispositions and resulting actions.&lt;ref name=Halwani/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baker LA, Bezdjian S, Raine A |title=Behavioral genetics: the science of antisocial behavior |journal=Law Contemp Probl |volume=69 |issue=1-2 |pages=7–46 |year=2006 |pmid=18176636 |pmc=2174903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12770">'''Collective cell migration''' describes the movements of group of cells and the [[emergence]] of collective behavior from cell-environment interactions and cell-cell communication. Collective cell migration is an essential process in the lives of [[multicellular organisms]], e.g. [[embryonic development]], [[wound healing]] and cancer spreading ([[metastasis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedl|first1=P|last2=Hegerfeldt|first2=Y|last3=Tusch|first3=M|title=Collective cell migration in morphogenesis and cancer|journal=[[The International Journal of Developmental Biology]]|date=2004|volume=48|issue=5-6|pages=441–9|doi=10.1387/ijdb.041821|pmid=15349818}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells can migrate as a cohesive group (e.g. [[epithelial cells]]) or have transient cell-cell adhesion sites (e.g. [[mesenchymal cells]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weijer|first1=CJ|title=Collective cell migration in development|journal=[[Journal of Cell Science]]|date=15 September 2009|volume=122|issue=Pt 18|pages=3215–23|doi=10.1242/jcs.036517|pmid=19726631}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also migrate in different modes like sheets, strands, tubes, and clusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedl|first1=P|title=Prespecification and plasticity: shifting mechanisms of cell migration|journal=[[Current Opinion in Cell Biology]]|date=February 2004|volume=16|issue=1|pages=14–23|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2003.11.001|pmid=15037300}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Cell migration|single-cell migration]] has been extensively studied, collective cell migration is a relatively new field with applications in preventing birth defects or dysfunction of embryos. It may improve cancer treatment by enabling doctors to prevent tumors from spreading and forming new tumors.

== Cell-environment interactions  ==

The environment of the migrating cell can affect its speed, persistence and direction of migration by stimulating it. The [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) provides not only the structural and biochemical support, but also plays a major role in regulating cell behavior. Different ECM proteins (such as [[collagen]], [[elastin]], [[fibronectin]], [[laminin]], and others) allow cells to adhere and migrate, while forming [[focal adhesions]] in the front and disassembling them in the back. Using these adhesion sites, cells also sense the mechanical properties of the ECM. Cells can be guided by a gradient of those proteins ([[haptotaxis]]) or a gradient of soluble substrates in the liquid phase surrounding the cell ([[chemotaxis]]). Cells sense the substrate through their [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s and migrate toward the concentration (or the opposite direction). Another form of stimulation can be rigidity gradients of the ECM ([[durotaxis]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Confinement ===

Collective cell migration is enhanced by geometrical confinement of an [[extracellular matrix]] [[molecule]] (e.g. the [[proteoglycan]] [[versican]] in [[neural crest]] cells), that acts as a barrier, to promote the [[emergence]] of organized migration in separated streams. Confinement is also observed [[in vivo]], where the optimal width is a function of the number of migrating cells in different streams of different [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szabó|first1=András|last2=Melchionda|first2=Manuela|last3=Nastasi|first3=Giancarlo|last4=Woods|first4=Mae L.|last5=Campo|first5=Salvatore|last6=Perris|first6=Roberto|last7=Mayor|first7=Roberto|title=In vivo confinement promotes collective migration of neural crest cells|journal=[[Journal of Cell Biology]]|date=6 June 2016|volume=213|issue=5|pages=543–555|doi=10.1083/jcb.201602083|pmc=4896058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cell-cell communication ==

Migrating isolated cell responds to cues in its environment and changes its behavior accordingly. As cell-cell communication does not play a major role in this case, similar trajectories are observed in different isolated cells. However, when the cell migrates as part of the collective, it not only responds to its environment but also interacts with other cells through soluble substrates and physical contact. These cell-cell communication mechanisms are the main reasons for the difference between efficient migration of the collective and [[random walk]] movements of the isolated cell. Cell-cell communication mechanisms are widely studied experimentally ([[in vivo]] and [[in vitro]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayor|first1=R|last2=Etienne-Manneville|first2=S|title=The front and rear of collective cell migration|journal=[[Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology]]|date=February 2016|volume=17|issue=2|pages=97–109|doi=10.1038/nrm.2015.14|pmid=26726037}}&lt;/ref&gt; and computationally ([[in silico]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szabó|first1=A|last2=Mayor|first2=R|title=Modelling collective cell migration of neural crest|journal=[[Current Opinion in Cell Biology]]|date=October 2016|volume=42|pages=22–28|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2016.03.023|pmid=27085004|pmc=5017515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Co-attraction ===

Co-attraction between collectively migrating cells is the process by which cells of the same type secrete [[chemotaxis|chemo-attractant]] (e.g. [[C3a (complement)|C3a]] in neural crest cells), that stimulates other cells in the group that have the [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s to that chemo-attractant. Cells sense the secreted substrate and respond to the stimulation by moving towards each other's and maintain high cell density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woods|first1=ML|last2=Carmona-Fontaine|first2=C|last3=Barnes|first3=CP|last4=Couzin|first4=ID|last5=Mayor|first5=R|last6=Page|first6=KM|title=Directional collective cell migration emerges as a property of cell interactions|journal=[[PLoS ONE]]|date=2014|volume=9|issue=9|pages=e104969|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0104969|pmid=25181349|pmc=4152153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carmona-Fontaine|first1=C|last2=Theveneau|first2=E|last3=Tzekou|first3=A|last4=Tada|first4=M|last5=Woods|first5=M|last6=Page|first6=KM|last7=Parsons|first7=M|last8=Lambris|first8=JD|last9=Mayor|first9=R|title=Complement fragment C3a controls mutual cell attraction during collective cell migration|journal=[[Developmental Cell]]|date=13 December 2011|volume=21|issue=6|pages=1026–37|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2011.10.012|pmid=22118769|pmc=3272547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contact inhibition of locomotion ===
Contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL) is a process in which the cell changes its direction of movement after colliding into another cell. Those cells could be of the same cell type or different types. The contacts ([[Cell junction|cell-junctions]]) are created by [[Transmembrane protein|transmembrane]] [[glycoprotein]]s named [[cadherin]]s ([[E-cadherin]], [[N-cadherin]] or [[cadherin 11]]) and other [[protein]]s. After cell-cell contact, the protrusions of cells in the contact direction are inhibited. In the CIL process, cells migrate away from each other by repolarizing in the new direction, so that new protrusions are formed in the front while contractions pull the back from contact.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Contact inhibition|Contact inhibition of proliferation]] (CIP) is the inhibition of cell division with increasing percent of confluency. CIP and CIL are two different processes, which are sometimes mistakenly interrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stoker|first1=MG|last2=Rubin|first2=H|title=Density dependent inhibition of cell growth in culture|journal=Nature|date=8 July 1967|volume=215|issue=5097|pages=171–2|pmid=6049107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of studied systems ==
Collective cell migration is studied over many model species.

[[Border cells]] in flies (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''): the border cells migrate during the differentiation of egg cells to be ready for fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bianco|first1=A|last2=Poukkula|first2=M|last3=Cliffe|first3=A|last4=Mathieu|first4=J|last5=Luque|first5=CM|last6=Fulga|first6=TA|last7=Rørth|first7=P|title=Two distinct modes of guidance signalling during collective migration of border cells|journal=Nature|date=19 July 2007|volume=448|issue=7151|pages=362–5|doi=10.1038/nature05965|pmid=17637670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[lateral line]] in [[zebrafish]]: collective cell migration from head to tails is essential to the development of the sensory system of the fish.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34370">'''Community-acquired pneumonia''' ('''CAP''') refers to [[pneumonia]] (any of several lung [[disease]]s) contracted by a person with little contact with the healthcare system. The chief difference between [[hospital-acquired pneumonia]] (HAP) and CAP is that patients with HAP live in long-term care facilities or have recently visited a hospital. CAP is common, affecting people of all ages, and its symptoms occur as a result of [[oxygen]]-absorbing areas of the lung ([[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]]) filling with fluid. This inhibits lung function, causing [[dyspnea]], [[fever]], [[chest pain]]s and [[cough]].

CAP, the most common type of pneumonia, is a leading cause of illness and death worldwide. Its causes include [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[parasitism|parasites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pneumonia Causes – Mayo Clinic|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/basics/causes/con-20020032|website = www.mayoclinic.org|accessdate = 2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAP is [[diagnosis|diagnosed]] by assessing [[symptom]]s, making a [[physical examination]] and on [[x-ray]]. Other tests, such as [[sputum]] examination, supplement chest x-rays. Patients with CAP sometimes require hospitalization, and it is treated primarily with [[antibiotics]], [[antipyretic]]s and [[cough medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pneumonia Treatments and drugs – Mayo Clinic|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/basics/treatment/con-20020032|website = www.mayoclinic.org|accessdate = 2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of CAP can be [[Preventive medicine|prevented]] by [[vaccination]]&lt;ref&gt;Jose RJ, Brown JS.

== {{anchor|Cause}}Causes ==
Over 100 microorganisms can cause CAP, with most cases caused by ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]''. Certain groups of people are more susceptible to CAP-causing pathogens; for example, [[infant]]s, adults with [[chronic condition]]s (such as [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]), senior citizens, [[Alcoholism|alcoholics]] and others with compromised immune systems are more likely to develop CAP from ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' or [[Pneumocystis jirovecii|''Pneumocystis jirovecii'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is pneumonia? What causes pneumonia?|url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/151632.php|accessdate = 2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A definitive cause is identified in only half the cases.

=== Infants ===
Infants can acquire lung infections before birth by breathing infected [[amniotic fluid]] or through a blood-borne infection which crossed the [[placenta]]. Infants can also inhale contaminated fluid from the [[vagina]] at birth. The most prevalent pathogen causing CAP in newborns is ''[[Streptococcus agalactiae]]'', also known as group-B streptococcus (GBS). GBS causes more than half of CAP in the first week after birth.&lt;ref name=Webber /&gt; Other bacterial causes of neonatal CAP include ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'' and a variety of [[Mycobacterium|mycobacteria]]. CAP-causing viruses may also be transferred from mother to child; [[herpes simplex virus]] (the most common) is life-threatening, and [[adenoviridae]], [[mumps]] and [[enterovirus]] can also cause pneumonia. Another cause of CAP in this group is ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'', acquired at birth but not causing pneumonia until two to four weeks later; it usually presents with no fever and a characteristic, staccato cough.

CAP in older infants reflects increased exposure to microorganisms, with common bacterial causes including ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Moraxella catarrhalis]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. Maternally-derived [[syphilis]] is also a cause of CAP in this age group. Viruses include [[human respiratory syncytial virus]] (RSV), [[human metapneumovirus]], adenovirus, [[human parainfluenza viruses]], [[influenza]] and [[rhinovirus]], and RSV is a common source of illness and hospitalization in infants.&lt;ref name=Abzug /&gt; CAP caused by fungi or parasites is not usually seen in otherwise-healthy infants.

=== Children ===
Although children older than one month tend to be at risk for the same microorganisms as adults, children under five are much less likely to have pneumonia caused by ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila pneumoniae]]'' or ''[[Legionella|Legionella pneumophila]]''. In contrast, older children and teenagers are more likely to acquire ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' and ''Chlamydophila pneumoniae'' than adults.&lt;ref name=Wubbel /&gt;

=== Adults ===
A full spectrum of microorganisms is responsible for CAP in adults, and patients with certain [[risk factor]]s are more susceptible to infections of certain groups of microorganisms. Identifying people at risk for infection by these organisms aids in appropriate treatment.
Many less-common organisms can cause CAP in adults, and are identified from specific risk factors or treatment failure for common causes.

=== Risk factors ===
Some patients have an underlying problem which increases their risk of infection. Some risk factors are:
*''Obstruction'': When part of the airway ([[bronchus]]) leading to the alveoli is obstructed, the lung cannot eliminate fluid; this can lead to pneumonia. One cause of obstruction, especially in young children, is inhalation of a foreign object such as a marble or toy. The object lodges in a small airway, and pneumonia develops in the obstructed area of the lung. Another cause of obstruction is [[lung cancer]], which can block the flow of air.
*''Lung disease'': Patients with underlying lung disease are more likely to develop pneumonia. Diseases such as emphysema and habits such as [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] result in more-frequent and more-severe bouts of pneumonia. In children, recurrent pneumonia may indicate [[cystic fibrosis]] or [[pulmonary sequestration]].
*''Immune problems'': [[Immunodeficiency|Immune-deficient]] patients, such as those with [[HIV/AIDS]], are more likely to develop pneumonia. Other immune problems range from severe childhood immune deficiencies, such as [[Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome]], to the less-severe [[common variable immunodeficiency]].&lt;ref name=Mundy /&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==
CAP's symptoms are the result of lung infection by [[microorganism]]s and the [[immune system]]'s response to the infection. Mechanisms of infection are different for [[virus]]es and other microorganisms.

===Viruses===
Viruses cause as much as 20 percent of CAP cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Respiratory infections|last=Mandell|first=L|publisher=CRC Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common viruses are influenza, parainfluenza, human respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus. Less-common viruses which may cause serious illness include [[chickenpox]], [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]], [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|avian flu]] and [[hantavirus]].&lt;ref name="Roux" /&gt;

Typically, a virus enters the lungs through the inhalation of water droplets and invades the cells lining the airways and the alveoli. This leads to cell death; the cells are killed by the virus or they [[apoptosis|self-destruct]]. Further lung damage occurs when the immune system responds to the infection. [[White blood cell]]s, particularly [[lymphocyte]]s, activate chemicals known as [[cytokine]]s which cause fluid to leak into the alveoli. The combination of cell destruction and fluid-filled alveoli interrupts the transportation of oxygen into the bloodstream. In addition to their effects on the lungs, many viruses affect other [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]]. Viral infections weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to bacterial infection (including bacterial pneumonia).

===Bacteria and fungi===
Although most cases of bacterial pneumonia are caused by ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', infections by [[atypical bacteria]] such as ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae,'' ''Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and'' ''Legionella pneumophila'' can also cause CAP. Enteric [[gram-negative bacteria]], such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'', are a group of bacteria that typically live in the [[large intestine]]; contamination of food and water by these bacteria can result in outbreaks of pneumonia. ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', an uncommon cause of CAP, is a difficult bacteria to treat.

Bacteria and fungi typically enter the lungs through the inhalation of water droplets, although they can reach the lung through the bloodstream if an infection is present and often live in the [[respiratory tract]]. In the alveoli, bacteria and fungi travel into the spaces between cells and adjacent alveoli through connecting pores. The immune system responds by releasing [[neutrophil granulocyte]]s, white blood cells responsible for attacking microorganisms, into the lungs. The neutrophils [[phagocytosis|engulf]] and kill the microorganisms, releasing cytokines which activate the entire immune system. This response causes fever, chills and fatigue, common symptoms of CAP. The neutrophils, bacteria and fluids leaked from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, impairing oxygen transport. Bacteria may travel from the lung to the bloodstream, causing [[septic shock]] (very low blood pressure which damages the [[brain]], [[kidney]], and [[heart]]).

===Parasites===
A variety of parasites can affect the lungs, generally entering the body through the skin or by being swallowed. They then travel to the lungs through the blood, where the combination of cell destruction and immune response disrupts oxygen transport.

== Diagnosis ==
Patients with symptoms of CAP require evaluation. Diagnosis of pneumonia is made clinically, rather than on the basis of a particular test.&lt;ref name="Mandell"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mandell | first=L. A. | last2=Wunderink | first2=R. G. | last3=Anzueto | first3=A. | last4=Bartlett | first4=J. G. | last5=Campbell | first5=G. D. | last6=Dean | first6=N. C. | last7=Dowell | first7=S. F. | last8=File | first8=T.

[[Palpation|Palpating]] the chest as it expands and tapping the chest wall ([[Percussion (medicine)|percussion]]) to identify dull, [[Resonance|non-resonant]] areas can identify stiffness and fluid, signs of CAP. Listening to the lungs with a [[stethoscope]] ([[auscultation]]) can also reveal signs associated with CAP. A lack of normal breath sounds or the presence of [[crackles]] can indicate fluid consolidation. Increased vibration of the chest when speaking, known as tactile fremitus, and increased volume of whispered speech during auscultation can also indicate fluid.&lt;ref name=Metlay /&gt;

When signs of pneumonia are discovered during evaluation, chest [[X-ray]]s, are performed to support a diagnosis of CAP, and examination of the [[blood]] and [[sputum]] for infectious [[microorganism]]s and [[Medical laboratory|blood tests]] may be used to support a diagnosis of CAP.&lt;ref name="Mandell"/&gt; Diagnostic tools depend on the severity of illness, local practices and concern about [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] of the infection. All patients with CAP should have their blood oxygen monitored with [[pulse oximetry]]. In some cases, [[arterial blood gas]] analysis may be required to determine the amount of oxygen in the blood. A [[complete blood count]] (CBC) may reveal extra [[white blood cell]]s, indicating infection.

Chest X-rays and [[X-ray computed tomography]] (CT) can reveal areas of [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] (seen as white), indicating consolidation. CAP does not always appear on x-rays, because the disease is in its initial stages or involves a part of the lung an x-ray does not see well. In some cases, chest CT can reveal pneumonia not seen on x-rays. However, [[congestive heart failure]] or other types of lung damage can mimic CAP on x-rays.&lt;ref name=Syrjala /&gt;

Several tests can identify the cause of CAP. [[Blood culture]]s can isolate bacteria or fungi in the bloodstream. Sputum [[Gram staining]] and culture can also reveal the causative microorganism. In severe cases, [[bronchoscopy]] can collect fluid for culture. Special tests can be performed if an uncommon microorganism is suspected, such as urinalysis for [[Legionella]] [[antigen]] in [[Legionnaires' disease]].

== Treatment ==
{{Multiple image|image1=Lungs with CAP Pretreatment.jpg|image2=Lungs with CAP postreatment.jpg|footer=Chest X-rays of a CAP patient before (''left'') and after treatment|footer_align=center}}
CAP is treated with an antibiotic that kills the offending microorganism and by managing complications. If the causative microorganism is unidentified (often the case), the laboratory identifies the most-effective antibiotic; this may take several days.

Health professionals consider a person's risk factors for various organisms when choosing an initial antibiotic. Additional consideration is given to the treatment setting; most patients are cured by oral medication, while others must be hospitalized for [[intravenous therapy]] or [[intensive care medicine|intensive care]].

Therapy for older children and adults generally includes treatment for atypical bacteria: typically a [[macrolide]] antibiotic (such as [[azithromycin]] or [[clarithromycin]]) or a [[Quinolone antibiotic|quinolone]], such as [[levofloxacin]]. [[Doxycycline]] is the antibiotic of choice in the UK for atypical bacteria, due to increased [[clostridium difficile colitis]] in hospital patients linked to the increased use of [[clarithromycin]].

=== Newborns ===
Most newborn infants with CAP are hospitalized, receiving IV [[ampicillin]] and [[gentamicin]] for at least ten days to treat the common causative agents ''[[streptococcus agalactiae]]'', ''[[listeria monocytogenes]]'' and ''[[escherichia coli]]''. To treat the [[herpes simplex virus]], IV [[acyclovir]] is administered for 21 days.

=== Children ===
Treatment of CAP in children depends on the child's age and the severity of illness. Children under five are not usually treated for atypical bacteria. If hospitalization is not required, a seven-day course of [[amoxicillin]] is often prescribed, with [[co-trimaxazole]] an alternative when there is allergy to penicillins.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lodha|first1=R|last2=Kabra|first2=SK|last3=Pandey|first3=RM|title=Antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia in children.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=4 June 2013|issue=6|pages=CD004874|pmid=23733365|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004874.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of newer antibiotics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  With the increase in [[Pneumococcal infection#Treatment|drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae]], antibiotics such as [[cefpodoxime]] may become more popular.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt; Hospitalized children receive intravenous [[ampicillin]], [[ceftriaxone]] or [[cefotaxime]], and a recent study found that a three-day course of antibiotics seems sufficient for most mild-to-moderate CAP in children.&lt;ref name=pmid18729535&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dimopoulos G, Matthaiou DK, Karageorgopoulos DE, Grammatikos AP, Athanassa Z, Falagas ME |title=Short- versus long-course antibacterial therapy for community-acquired pneumonia : a meta-analysis |journal=Drugs |volume=68 |issue=13 |pages=1841–54 |year=2008 |pmid=18729535 |doi=10.2165/00003495-200868130-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adults ===
In 2001 the [[American Thoracic Society]], drawing on the work of the [[British Thoracic Society|British]] and [[Canadian Thoracic Society|Canadian Thoracic Societies]], established guidelines for the management of adult CAP dividing patients into four categories based on common organisms:&lt;ref name=Neiderman /&gt;
*Healthy outpatients without risk factors: This group (the largest) is composed of otherwise-healthy patients without risk factors for DRSP, enteric [[gram-negative bacteria]], ''pseudomonas'' or other, less-common, causes of CAP. Primary microoganisms are viruses, atypical bacteria, penicillin-sensitive ''streptococcus pneumoniae'' and ''[[haemophilus influenzae]]''. Recommended drugs are macrolide antibiotics, such as [[azithromycin]] or [[clarithromycin]], for seven&lt;ref name="pmid17765048"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li JZ, Winston LG, Moore DH, Bent S |title=Efficacy of short-course antibiotic regimens for community-acquired pneumonia: a meta-analysis |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=120 |issue=9 |pages=783–90 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17765048 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2007.04.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ten days.
*Outpatients with underlying illness or risk factors: Although this group does not require hospitalization, patients have underlying health problems (such as emphysema or heart failure) or are at risk for DRSP or enteric gram-negative bacteria. They are treated with a quinolone active against ''streptococcus pneumoniae'' (such as [[levofloxacin]]) or a [[β-lactam antibiotic]] (such as [[cefpodoxime]], [[cefuroxime]], [[amoxicillin]] or [[amoxicillin/clavulanic acid]]) and a macrolide antibiotic, such as [[azithromycin]] or [[clarithromycin]], for seven to ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vardakas KZ, Siempos II, Grammatikos A, Athanassa Z, Korbila IP, Falagas ME |title=Respiratory fluoroquinolones for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=CMAJ |volume=179 |issue=12 |pages=1269–77 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19047608 |pmc=2585120 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.080358}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hospitalized patients without risk for ''pseudomonas'': This group requires intravenous antibiotics, with a quinolone active against ''streptococcus pneumoniae'' (such as [[levofloxacin]]), a β-lactam antibiotic (such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, [[ampicillin/sulbactam]] or high-dose ampicillin plus a macrolide antibiotic (such as [[azithromycin]] or [[clarithromycin]]) for seven to ten days.
*Intensive-care patients at risk for ''[[pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'': These patients require antibiotics targeting this difficult-to-eradicate bacterium. One regimen is an intravenous antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as [[cefepime]], [[imipenem]], [[meropenem]] or [[piperacillin|piperacillin/tazobactam]], plus an IV antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as [[levofloxacin]]. Another is an IV antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an aminoglycoside such as [[gentamicin]] or [[tobramycin]], plus a macrolide (such as azithromycin) or a nonpseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as [[ciprofloxacin]].

For mild-to-moderate CAP, shorter courses of antibiotics (3–7 days) seem to be sufficient.&lt;ref name=pmid18729535/&gt;

Some patients with CAP will be at increased risk of death despite antimicrobial treatment. A key reason for this is the host's exaggerated inflammatory response. On one hand it is required to control the infection but on the other, it leads to bystander tissue damage. As a consequence of this recent research focuses on immunomodulatory therapy that can modulate the immune response to reduce injury to the lung and other affected organs such as the heart. Although the evidence for these agents has not resulted in their routine use, there potential benefits are highly promising.&lt;ref&gt;Woods DR, José RJ. Current and emerging evidence for immunomodulatory therapy in community-acquired pneumonia. Ann Res Hosp 2017;1:33 http://arh.amegroups.com/article/view/3806&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Hospitalize}}Hospitalization ===
Some CAP patients require intensive care, with [[clinical prediction rule]]s such as the [[pneumonia severity index]] and [[CURB-65]] guiding the decision to hospitalize.&lt;ref name=Fine /&gt; Factors increasing the need for hospitalization include:
* Age greater than 65
* Underlying chronic illnesses
* [[Respiratory rate]] greater than 30 per minute
* Systolic [[blood pressure]] less than 90 [[Millimeter of mercury|mmHg]]
* [[Heart rate]] greater than 125 per minute
* [[Temperature]] below 35 or over 40&amp;nbsp;°C
* Confusion
* Evidence of infection outside the lung

Laboratory results indicating hospitalization include:
* Arterial oxygen tension less than 60&amp;nbsp;mm Hg
* [[Carbon dioxide]] over 50 mmHg or [[pH]] under 7.35 while breathing room air
* [[Hematocrit]] under 30 percent
* [[Creatinine]] over 1.2&amp;nbsp;mg/dl or [[blood urea nitrogen]] over 20&amp;nbsp;mg/dl
* White-blood-cell count under 4 × 10^9/L or over 30 × 10^9/L
* Neutrophil count under 1 x 10^9/L

X-ray findings indicating hospitalization include:
* Involvement of more than one lobe of the [[lung]]
* Presence of a cavity
* [[Pleural effusion]]

== Prognosis ==
The CAP outpatient mortality rate is less than one percent, with fever typically responding to the first two days of therapy and other symptoms in the first week. However, X-rays may remain abnormal for at least a month. Hospitalized patients have an average mortality rate of 12 percent, with the rate rising to 40 percent for patients with bloodstream infections or requiring intensive care.&lt;ref name=Woodhead /&gt; Factors increasing mortality are identical to those indicating hospitalization.

Unresponsive CAP may be due to a complication, a previously-unknown health problem, inappropriate antibiotics for the causative organism, a previously-unsuspected microorganism (such as [[tuberculosis]]) or a condition mimicking CAP (such as [[granuloma]] with polyangiitis). Additional tests include [[X-ray computed tomography]], [[bronchoscopy]] or lung [[biopsy]].

== {{anchor|Sepsis|Respiratory failure|Pleural effusion and empyema|Abscess}}Complications ==
Major complications of CAP include:
*[[Sepsis]], when microorganisms enter the bloodstream and the [[immune system]] responds. Sepsis often occurs with [[bacterial pneumonia]], with ''streptococcus pneumoniae'' the most-common cause. Patients with sepsis require intensive care, with blood-pressure monitoring and support against hypotension. Sepsis can cause liver, kidney and heart damage.
*Respiratory failure: CAP patients often have [[dyspnea]], which may require support. Non-invasive machines (such as [[bilevel positive airway pressure]]), a [[tracheal tube]] or a [[Medical ventilator|ventilator]] may be used.
*Pleural effusion and empyema: Microorganisms from the lung may trigger fluid collection in the [[pleural cavity]]. If the microorganisms are in the fluid, the collection is an [[empyema]]. If pleural fluid is present, it should be [[thoracentesis|collected with a needle]] and examined. Depending on the results, complete drainage of the fluid with a [[chest tube]] may be necessary. If the fluid is not drained, bacteria may continue to proliferate because antibiotics do not penetrate the pleural cavity well.
*[[Abscess]]: A pocket of fluid and bacteria may be seen on an X-ray as a cavity in the lung. Abscesses, typical of [[aspiration pneumonia]], usually contain a mixture of [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic bacteria]]. Although antibiotics can usually cure abscesses, sometimes they require drainage by a surgeon or [[Interventional radiology|radiologist]].

== Epidemiology ==
CAP is common worldwide, and a major cause of death in all age groups. In children, most deaths (over two million a year) occur in newborn period. According to a [[World Health Organization]] estimate, one in three newborn deaths are from pneumonia.&lt;ref name=Garenne /&gt; Mortality decreases with age until late adulthood, with the elderly at risk for CAP and its associated mortality.

More CAP cases occur during the winter than at other times of the year. CAP is more common in males than females, and more common in [[black people]] than Caucasians&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Julio A|last2=Wiemken|first2=Timothy L|last3=Peyrani|first3=Paula|last4=Arnold|first4=Forest W|last5=Kelley|first5=Robert|last6=Mattingly|first6=William A|last7=Nakamatsu|first7=Raul|last8=Pena|first8=Senen|last9=Guinn|first9=Brian E|date=2017-07-28|title=Adults Hospitalized With Pneumonia in the United States: Incidence, Epidemiology, and Mortality|url=https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1806/4049508|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|language=en|volume=65|issue=11|pages=1806–1812|doi=10.1093/cid/cix647|issn=1058-4838}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Patients with underlying illnesses (such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[cystic fibrosis]], COPD, [[tobacco smoking]], [[alcoholism]] or [[immunosuppression|immune-system problems]]) have an increased risk of developing pneumonia.&lt;ref name=Almirall /&gt;

== Prevention ==
CAP may be prevented by treating underlying illnesses increasing its risk, by [[smoking cessation]] and [[vaccination]] of children and adults. Vaccination against ''[[haemophilus influenzae]]'' and ''[[streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' in the first year of life has reduced their role in childhood CAP. A vaccine against ''[[streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', available for adults, is recommended for healthy individuals over 65 and all adults with COPD, [[heart failure]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[cirrhosis]], [[alcoholism]], [[cerebrospinal fluid]] leaks or who have had a [[splenectomy]]. Re-vaccination may be required after five or ten years.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt;

Patients who are vaccinated against ''streptococcus pneumoniae'', [[health professional]]s, nursing-home residents and pregnant women should be vaccinated annually against [[influenza]].&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt; During an outbreak, drugs such as [[amantadine]], [[rimantadine]], [[zanamivir]] and [[oseltamivir]] have been demonstrated to prevent influenza.&lt;ref name=Hayden /&gt;

'''Disability Insurance''', often called '''DI''' or '''disability income insurance''', or '''income protection''', is a form of [[insurance]] that insures the beneficiary's earned income against the risk that a [[disability]] creates a barrier for a worker to complete the core functions of their work. For example, the worker may suffer from an inability to maintain composure in the case of psychological disorders or an injury, illness or condition that causes physical impairment or incapacity to work. It encompasses paid sick leave, short-term [[disability benefits]] (STD), and long-term disability benefits (LTD).&lt;ref name="uslabor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm|title=BLS Information |date=February 28, 2008|work=Glossary|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Division of Information Services |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics show that in the US a disabling accident occurs, on average, once every second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability Statistics |date=March 12, 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=National Treasury Employees Union - Chapter 78 |url=http://nteu-chapter78.org/documents/member_benefits/Disability%20Statistics.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727133227/http://nteu-chapter78.org/documents/member_benefits/Disability%20Statistics.pdf |archivedate=July 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, nearly 18.5% of Americans are currently living with a disability,{{cn|date=February 2016}} and 1 out of every 4 persons in the US workforce will suffer a disabling injury before retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability Insurance Infographic |date=January 18, 2013 |url=http://www.disabilityinsurance.org/articles/disability-insurance-infographic.html |accessdate=January 7, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123064308/http://www.disabilityinsurance.org/articles/disability-insurance-infographic.html |archivedate=January 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Railway Passengers Assurance Company header.jpg|thumb|190x190px|The Railway Passengers Assurance Company was founded in 1848 as the first company to provide [[accident insurance]].]]
In the late 19th century, modern disability insurance began to become available. It was originally known as "accident insurance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/health-insurance1.htm |publisher=Howstuffworks |title=How Health Insurance Works|date=2006-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encarta |title=Health Insurance |url=http://ca.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576408_8/Health_Insurance.html#s49 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwqZV6V7?url=http://ca.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576408_8/Health_Insurance.html |archivedate=November 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first company to offer accident insurance was the Railway Passengers Assurance Company, formed in 1848 in [[England]] to insure against the rising number of fatalities on the nascent [[railway]] system. It was registered as the Universal Casualty Compensation Company to:
:...grant assurances on the lives of persons travelling by railway and to grant, in cases, of accident not having a fatal termination, compensation to the assured for injuries received under certain conditions.

The company was able to reach an agreement with the [[railway company|railway companies]], whereby basic accident insurance would be sold as a package deal along with travel [[Train ticket|ticket]]s to customers. The company charged higher premiums for second and third class travel due to the higher risk of injury in the roofless [[carriage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviva.com/about-us/heritage/companies/railway-passengers-assurance-company/|title=Railway Passengers Assurance Company Ltd|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. P. Woodward |title=The Disability Insurance Policy |journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |date=March 1917 |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=227–237 |url=http://ann.sagepub.com/content/70/1/227.extract |accessdate=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual disability insurance===
Those whose employers do not provide benefits, and self-employed individuals who desire disability coverage, may purchase  policies. Premiums and available benefits for individual coverage vary considerably between companies, occupations, states and countries. In general, premiums are higher for policies that provide more monthly benefits, offer benefits for longer periods of time, and start payments of benefits more quickly following a disability claim. Premiums also tend to be higher for policies that define disability in broader terms, meaning the policy would pay benefits in a wider variety of circumstances thus covering more insurances that the individual was going to purchase. Web-based disability insurance calculators assist in determining the disability insurance needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lifehappens.org/disability-insurance/disability-calculator |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422184302/http://www.lifehappens.org/disability-insurance/disability-calculator |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-22 |title=LIFE Foundation &amp;#124; Disability Insurance Needs Calculator |publisher=Lifehappens.org |accessdate=2011-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-limit disability insurance===
High-limit disability insurance is designed to keep individual disability benefits at 65% of income regardless of income level. Coverage is typically issued supplemental to standard coverage. With high-limit disability insurance, benefits can be anywhere from an additional $2,000 to $100,000 per month. Single policy issue and participation (individual or group long-term disability) coverage has gone up to $30,000 with some hospitals. 

===Business overhead expense disability insurance===
Business Overhead Expense (BOE) coverage reimburses a business for overhead expenses should the owner experience a disability.  Eligible benefits include: rent or mortgage payments, utilities, leasing costs, laundry/maintenance, accounting/billing and collection service fees, business insurance premiums, employee salaries, employee benefits, property tax, and other regular monthly expenses.

===National social insurance programs===
In most developed countries, the single most important form of disability insurance is that provided by the national government for all citizens. For example, the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s version is part of [[National Insurance]]; the [[United States|U.S.]]'s version is [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security (SS)]]—specifically, several parts of SS including [[Social Security Disability Insurance|Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)]] and [[Supplemental Security Income|Supplemental Security Income (SSI)]]. These programs provide a floor beneath all other disability insurance. In other words, they are the safety net that catches everyone who was otherwise (a) uninsured or (b) underinsured. As such, they are large programs with many beneficiaries. The general theory of the benefit formula is that the benefit is enough to prevent abject poverty.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In addition to federally funded programs, there are five states which currently offer state funded Disability Insurance programs. These programs are designed for short term disabilities only. The coverage amount is determined by the applicant's level of income over the previous 12 months. The states which currently fund disability insurance programs are California, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityinsurance.org/articles/does-my-state-offer-disability-insurance.html|title=Does My State Offer Disability Insurance?|last=|first=|date=2013-12-17|website=DisabilityInsurance.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120113033/http://www.disabilityinsurance.org/articles/does-my-state-offer-disability-insurance.html|archivedate=January 20, 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-01-17|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employer-supplied disability insurance===
One of the most common reasons for disability is on-the-job injury, which explains why the second largest form of disability insurance is that provided by employers to cover their employees. There are several subtypes that may or may not be separate parts of the benefits package: workers' compensation and more general disability insurance policies.

====Workers' compensation====
{{main|Workers' compensation}}
Workers' compensation (also known by variations of that name, e.g., '''workman's comp''', '''workmen's comp''', '''worker's comp''', '''compo''') offers payments to employees who are (usually temporarily, rarely permanently) unable to work because of a job-related injury. However, workers' compensation is in fact more than just income insurance, because it compensates for economic loss (past and future), reimbursement or payment of medical and life expenses (functioning in this case as a form of [[health insurance]]), and benefits payable to the dependents of workers killed during employment (offering a form of [[life insurance]]).  Workers compensation provides no coverage to those not working. Statistics have shown that the majority of disabilities occur while the injured person is not working and therefore is not covered by workers' compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilitycanhappen.org/chances_disability/causes.asp |title=Common Causes of Disability; Cancer, Heart Disease, Diabetes, Arthritis and Lifestyle Choices |publisher=Disabilitycanhappen.org |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine's cover story for March 5, 2007 discussed the problems that American veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq wars have faced in receiving VA benefits. The article describes one veteran who waited 17 months to start receiving payments. Another article, in ''[[The New York Times]]'', points out that besides long waits, there is also variation based on the veteran's state of residence and whether he/she is a veteran of the Army, National Guard, or Reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | last = Urbina | first = Ian |author2=Ron Nixon | title = Veterans Face Vast Inequities Over Disability | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 2007-03-09 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/washington/09veterans.html
 | accessdate = 2007-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Newsweek'' article says that it can be difficult for a veteran to get his or her claim approved; ''Newsweek'' described the benefits thus:

:"A veteran with a disability rating of 100 percent gets about $2,400 a month—more if he or she has children. A 50 percent rating brings in around $700 a month. But for many returning servicemen burdened with wounds, it is, initially at least, their sole income."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Forgotten Heroes |work=Newsweek |volume=149 |issue=10 |pages=28–37 |date=March 5, 2007 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17316437/site/newsweek/ |pmid=17380811 |last1=Ephron |first1=D |last2=Childress |first2=S |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |issn=0028-9604 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227133416/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17316437/site/newsweek/ |archivedate=February 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 figures cited above correspond in 2012 to $2,673 a month (more with children) and, for the 50% rating, $797 a month for a single veteran.

According to a sidebar in the same Newsweek article,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Untreated Wounds |journal=Newsweek |volume=149 |issue=10 |page=34 |date=March 5, 2007 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17316435/site/newsweek/ |pmid=17380812 |last1=Dehghanpisheh |first1=B |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |issn=0028-9604 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302104104/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17316435/site/newsweek/ |archivedate=March 2, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Americans injured in these wars, for all the obstacles to proper care, will probably receive much better compensation and health care than equally injured Afghan or Iraqi soldiers.

'''Ellen S. Berscheid''' (born 1936&lt;ref name=AAAS /&gt;) is an American [[Social psychology|social psychologist]]. She is Regents Professor at [[University of Minnesota]], where she received her PhD in 1965. Berscheid specializes in the research of interpersonal relationships. More specifically, her current research looks at external factors (environment) of a relationship and how they influence internal aspects (satisfaction) of that relationship.

==Career==
Berscheid started her collegiate career as an Education major at [[Beloit College]] in [[Wisconsin]], before transferring to [[University of Minnesota]]. There she was given a research assistant grant by her professor, Paul Secord. This kind of grant being given to an undergraduate was rare, especially for a student not majoring in psychology. Berscheid picked up psychology as her second major and graduated with honors. After graduation Berscheid applied for and received PHS Predoctoral Research Fellowship, at the University of Minnesota to work with [[Harold Kelley]]. However, Berscheid dealing with her new marriage and a death in her family decided to decline the offer and became a research administrator for [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]].

Berscheid thrived at Pillsbury and received a promotion the following year, something unprecedented for a woman in this field. However, Berscheid felt that she had outgrown her position at Pillsbury and left to pursue painting. During this time, Berscheid did apply for a research assistantship at the [[University of Minnesota]], under [[Elliot Aronson]]. During her interview Aronson and Berscheid clashed ideas on many different issues. Berscheid believed that she would never hear from Aronson after her interview. A few weeks later, she received a letter from him offering her the research assistantship. She obtained her Ph.D. while working under the direction of Elliot Aronson.

Since she did not receive a job in the psychology department, Berscheid took a job teaching Research Methods in the Business department where she met Elaine (Walster) Hatfield. Hatfield convinced Berscheid to join her in researching [[Equity theory|equity]] and [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]]. Two women conducting psychological research was rare and might have been stopped if too many people took notice, therefore Hatfield and Berscheid conducted their research quietly through a federal grant.

A few years later, Hatfield left the Business department for a job in the psychology department and Berscheid took over Hatfield’s job as Student Activities Bureau. Berscheid was expecting to be pushed into early retirement when she was offered a professorship in the psychology department, which was an all-male faculty, at the time. Berscheid has made many contributions in the field of relationship research and social psychology as a whole.

In 1983 Berscheid introduced the [[Emotion-in-Relationships Model]] (ERM), a theory designed to predict individual's experiences towards [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Kelley, H.

Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

Berscheid is the recipient of Donald T. Campbell Award for Distinguished Research in [[Social Psychology]] from the [[Society for Personality and Social Psychology]], and the Distinguished Scientist Award from the [[Society of Experimental Social Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association (1998). Awards for distinguished scientific contributions: Ellen S. Berscheid. American Psychologist, 53(4), 366-368.

==Controversy==

In 1974, Berscheid was the center of a controversy regarding federal funding of research. Senator [[William Proxmire]] of Wisconsin used her as an example when he awarded the National Science Foundation his first [[William Proxmire#Golden Fleece Award|Golden Fleece]] award, which was presented monthly between 1975 and 1988, in order to focus media attention on projects Proximire viewed as self-serving and wasteful of taxpayer dollar. Berscheid had been granted $84,000 by the foundation to research why people fall in love. The scandal "called into question use of public funds in scientific research." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/connections/201007/its-time-science-social-connection ''It's Time for a Science of Social Connection''].

'''Ernest Walter Retzlaff''', Ph.D. (February 19, 1918 &amp;ndash; 1989) was an American [[neurophysiologist]] and [[histologist]] who helped develop a form of [[manipulative therapy|manipulative healing therapy]] called [[Craniosacral therapy]] with Dr. John Upledger at [[Michigan State University]] in the 1970s.

In 1987, he published ''The Cranium and Its Sutures: Anatomy, Physiology, Clinical Applications and Annotated Bibliography of Research in the Cranial Field'' (Springer-Verlag) with his colleague Fredric L. Mitchell, Jr.

Retzlaff was born to German immigrant parents in [[Helena, Montana]], on Feb. 19, 1918.

'''Sir Francis Galton''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ɔː|l|t|ən}}; 16 February 1822&amp;nbsp;– 17 January 1911) was an English [[Victorian era]] [[statistics|statistician]], [[Progressivism|progressive]], [[polymath]], [[sociologist]], [[psychologist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galton.org/|title=Sir Francis Galton F.R.S: 1822-1911|work=galton.org|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famouspsychologists.org/francis-galton/|title=Francis Galton - Biography, Books and Theories|work=famouspsychologists.org|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropology|anthropologist]], [[Eugenics|eugenicist]], tropical [[Exploration|explorer]], [[geography|geographer]], [[Invention|inventor]], [[Meteorology|meteorologist]], proto-[[geneticist]], and [[Psychometrics|psychometrician]]. He was knighted in 1909.

Galton produced over 340 papers and books. He also created the statistical concept of [[correlation]] and widely promoted [[regression toward the mean]]. He was the first to apply statistical methods to the study of human differences and [[inheritance of intelligence]], and introduced the use of [[questionnaires]] and [[Statistical survey|survey]]s for collecting data on human communities, which he needed for genealogical and biographical works and for his [[anthropometrics|anthropometric]] studies.

He was a pioneer in [[eugenics]], coining the term itself&lt;ref&gt;Francis Galton, ''Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development'' (London, England: Macmillan and Co., 1883), pp. 24–25. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0BdjGirCpugC&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage From page 24:] "[This book's] intention is to touch on various topics more or less connected with that of the cultivation of race, or, as we might call it, with "eugenic"&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; questions, and to present the results of several of my own separate investigations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This is, with questions bearing on what is termed in Greek, ''eugenes'', namely, good in stock, hereditarily endowed with noble qualities. This, and the allied words, ''eugeneia'', etc., are equally applicable to men, brutes, and plants. We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock, which is by no means confined to questions of judicious mating, but which, especially in the case of man, takes cognisance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had. The word ''eugenics'' would sufficiently express the idea; it is at least a neater word and a more generalised one than ''viriculture'', which I once ventured to use."&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase "[[nature versus nurture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galton | first1 = Francis | year = 1874 | title = On men of science, their nature and their nurture | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_uE-bpGo2N4C&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain | volume = 7 | pages = 227–236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869) was the first social scientific attempt to study [[genius]] and [[greatness]].&lt;ref name="HereditaryGenius"&gt;Galton, F. (1869). [http://galton.org/books/hereditary-genius/ ''Hereditary Genius'']. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an investigator of the human mind, he founded [[psychometrics]] (the science of measuring mental faculties) and [[differential psychology]] and the [[lexical hypothesis]] of personality. He devised a method for classifying [[fingerprint]]s that proved useful in [[forensic science]]. He also conducted research on the [[Efficacy of prayer|power of prayer]], concluding it had none by its null effects on the longevity of those prayed for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Xavier |url=http://www.abelard.org/galton/galton.htm |title=Francis Galton : Statistical Inquiries into the Efficacy of Prayer, written in 1872; with notes on his other work |publisher=Abelard.org |date=17 January 1911 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His quest for the scientific principles of diverse phenomena extended even to the optimal method for making tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galton.org/books/art-of-travel/galton-1855-art-travel-1up.pdf|title=The Art of Travel p208 et seq 1855|work=galton.org|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the initiator of scientific [[meteorology]], he devised the first [[weather map]], proposed a theory of [[anticyclone]]s, and was the first to establish a complete record of short-term climatic phenomena on a European scale.&lt;ref name="scienceworld.wolfram.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Galton.html|title=Francis Galton (1822-1911) -- from Eric Weisstein's World of Scientific Biography|first1=Margherita |last1=Barile |first2=Eric W.|last2=Weisstein |authorlink=Eric W.

Appleton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Galton was born at "The Larches", a large house in the [[Sparkbrook]] area of [[Birmingham]], England, built on the site of "Fair Hill", the former home of [[Joseph Priestley]], which the [[botanist]] [[William Withering]] had renamed. He was [[Charles Darwin]]'s half-cousin, sharing the common grandparent [[Erasmus Darwin]]. His father was [[Samuel Tertius Galton]], son of [[Samuel "John" Galton]]. The Galtons were [[Quaker]] gun-manufacturers and bankers, while the Darwins were involved in medicine and science.

He was cousin of [[Douglas Strutt Galton]] and half-cousin of [[Charles Darwin]]. Both families had Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] and members who loved to invent in their spare time. Both Erasmus Darwin and Samuel Galton were founding members of the [[Lunar Society]] of Birmingham, which included [[Matthew Boulton|Boulton]], [[James Watt|Watt]], [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]], [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]], [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth|Edgeworth]]. Both families were known for their literary talent. Erasmus Darwin composed lengthy technical treatises in verse. Galton's aunt [[Mary Anne Galton]] wrote on aesthetics and religion, and her autobiography detailed the environment of her childhood populated by Lunar Society members.

[[File:Sir Francis Galton by Octavius Oakley.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Galton by [[Octavius Oakley]], 1840]]

Galton was a [[child prodigy]]&amp;nbsp;– he was reading by the age of two; at age five he knew some [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Latin]] and long division, and by the age of six he had moved on to adult books, including [[Shakespeare]] for pleasure, and poetry, which he quoted at length.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=4}} Later in life, Galton proposed a connection between genius and insanity based on his own experience:&lt;blockquote&gt;Men who leave their mark on the world are very often those who, being gifted and full of nervous power, are at the same time haunted and driven by a dominant idea, and are therefore within a measurable distance of insanity&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;Pearson, K. (1914). The life, letters and labours of Francis Galton (4 vols.). Cambridge:Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Galton attended [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], but chafed at the narrow classical curriculum and left at 16.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]. Retrieved 31 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His parents pressed him to enter the medical profession, and he studied for two years at [[Birmingham General Hospital]] and [[King's College London]] [[Medical School]]. He followed this up with mathematical studies at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge]], from 1840 to early 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=GLTN839F|name=Galton, Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the records of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]], it was in February 1844 that Galton became a [[freemason]] at the ''Scientific'' lodge, held at the Red Lion Inn in Cambridge, progressing through the three masonic degrees: Apprentice, 5 February 1844; Fellow Craft, 11 March 1844; Master Mason, 13 May 1844. A note in the record states: "Francis Galton Trinity College student, gained his certificate 13 March 1845".&lt;ref&gt;'Scientific Lodge No. 105 Cambridge' in ''Membership Records: Foreign and Country Lodges, Nos. 17–145, 1837–1862''. London: Library and Museum of Freemasonry (manuscript)&lt;/ref&gt; One of Galton's masonic certificates from ''Scientific'' lodge can be found among his papers at [[University College, London]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Merrington and J. Golden (1976) ''A List of the Papers and Correspondence of Sir Francis Galton (1822–1911) held in The Manuscripts Room, The Library, University College London''. The Galton Laboratory, University College London (typescript), at Section 88 on p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[nervous breakdown]] prevented Galton's intent to try for honours. He elected instead to take a "poll" (pass) B.A. degree, like his half-cousin Charles Darwin.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=5}} (Following the Cambridge custom, he was awarded an M.A. without further study, in 1847.) He briefly resumed his medical studies but the death of his father in 1844 left him emotionally destitute, though financially independent,{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and he terminated his medical studies entirely, turning to foreign travel, sport and technical invention.

In his early years Galton was an enthusiastic traveller, and made a notable solo trip through Eastern Europe to [[Constantinople]], before going up to Cambridge. In 1845 and 1846, he went to [[Egypt]] and travelled down the [[Nile]] to [[Khartoum]] in the [[Sudan]], and from there to [[Beirut]], [[Damascus]] and down the [[Jordan]].

In 1850 he joined the [[Royal Geographical Society]], and over the next two years mounted a long and difficult [[exploration|expedition]] into then little-known [[South West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]). He wrote a book on his experience, "Narrative of an Explorer in Tropical South Africa".{{sfn|Galton|1853}} He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] in 1853 and the Silver Medal of the French Geographical Society for his pioneering cartographic survey of the region.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=16}} This established his reputation as a geographer and explorer. He proceeded to write the best-selling ''The Art of Travel'', a handbook of practical advice for the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] on the move, which went through many editions and is still in print.

In January 1853, Galton met Louisa Jane Butler (1822–1897) at his neighbour's home and they were married on 1 August 1853. The union of 43 years proved childless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/search/pearson/vol2/pages/vol2_0320.htm|title=Life of Francis Galton by Karl Pearson Vol 2 : image 320|work=galton.org|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I7570&amp;ged=auden-bicknell.ged |title=Sir Francis Galton FRS FRGS&amp;nbsp;– I7570 – Individual Information&amp;nbsp;– PhpGedView |publisher=Stanford.edu |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Louisa Jane Galton00.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Louisa Jane Butler]]

==Middle years==
Galton was a [[polymath]] who made important contributions in many fields of science, including [[meteorology]] (the [[anti-cyclone]] and the first popular weather maps), statistics (regression and correlation), [[psychology]] ([[synaesthesia]]), [[biology]] (the nature and mechanism of heredity), and [[criminology]] (fingerprints). Much of this was influenced by his [[penchant]] for counting or measuring. Galton prepared the first [[weather map]] published in [[The Times]] (1 April 1875, showing the weather from the previous day, 31 March), now a standard feature in newspapers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galton.org/meteorologist.html |title=Francis Galton: Meteorologist |publisher=Galton.org |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became very active in the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], presenting many papers on a wide variety of topics at its meetings from 1858 to 1899.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=29}} He was the general secretary from 1863 to 1867, president of the Geographical section in 1867 and 1872, and president of the Anthropological Section in 1877 and 1885. He was active on the council of the Royal Geographical Society for over forty years, in various committees of the Royal Society, and on the Meteorological Council.

[[James McKeen Cattell]], a student of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] who had been reading Galton's articles, decided he wanted to study under him. He eventually built a professional relationship with Galton, measuring subjects and working together on research.&lt;ref name="Gilham"/&gt;

In 1888, Galton established a lab in the science galleries of the South Kensington Museum. In Galton's lab, participants could be measured to gain knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. Galton also used these data for his own research. He would typically charge people a small fee for his services.&lt;ref name="Hergenhann"&gt;Hergenhahn, B.R., (2008). ''An Introduction to the History of Psychology''. Colorado: Wadsworth Pub.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, Galton wrote a controversial letter to the Times titled 'Africa for the Chinese', where he argued that the Chinese, as a race capable of high civilisation and only temporarily stunted by the recent failures of Chinese dynasties, should be encouraged to immigrate to Africa and displace the supposedly inferior aboriginal blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galton.org/letters/africa-for-chinese/AfricaForTheChinese.htm |title=Africa for the Chinese by Francis Galton |date=5 June 1873|publisher=Galton.org |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heredity and eugenics==

[[File:Francis Galton2.jpg|thumb|Galton in his later years]]
The publication by his cousin Charles Darwin of ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 was an event that changed Galton's life {{Harv|Forrest|1974|page=84}}. He came to be gripped by the work, especially the first chapter on "Variation under Domestication", concerning [[animal breeding]].

Galton devoted much of the rest of his life to exploring variation in human populations and its implications, at which Darwin had only hinted. In doing so, he established a research program which embraced multiple aspects of human variation, from mental characteristics to height; from facial images to fingerprint patterns. This required inventing novel measures of traits, devising large-scale collection of data using those measures, and in the end, the discovery of new statistical techniques for describing and understanding the data.

Galton was interested at first in the question of whether human ability was [[hereditary]], and proposed to count the number of the relatives of various degrees of eminent men. If the qualities were hereditary, he reasoned, there should be more eminent men among the relatives than among the general population. To test this, he invented the methods of [[historiometry]]. Galton obtained extensive data from a broad range of biographical sources which he tabulated and compared in various ways. This pioneering work was described in detail in his book ''Hereditary Genius'' in 1869.&lt;ref name="HereditaryGenius"/&gt; Here he showed, among other things, that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when going from the first degree to the second degree relatives, and from the second degree to the third. He took this as evidence of the [[inheritance of intelligence|inheritance of abilities]].

Galton recognised the limitations of his methods in these two works, and believed the question could be better studied by comparisons of twins. His method envisaged testing to see if twins who were similar at birth diverged in dissimilar environments, and whether twins dissimilar at birth converged when reared in similar environments. He again used the method of questionnaires to gather various sorts of data, which were tabulated and described in a paper ''The history of twins'' in 1875. In so doing he anticipated the modern field of [[behaviour genetics]], which relies heavily on [[twin studies]]. He concluded that the evidence favoured nature rather than nurture. He also proposed [[adoption study|adoption studies]], including trans-racial adoption studies, to separate the effects of heredity and environment.

Galton recognised that cultural circumstances influenced the capability of a civilisation's citizens, and their [[reproductive success]]. In ''Hereditary Genius'', he envisaged a situation conducive to resilient and enduring civilisation as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The best form of civilization in respect to the improvement of the race, would be one in which society was not costly; where incomes were chiefly derived from professional sources, and not much through inheritance; where every lad had a chance of showing his abilities, and, if highly gifted, was enabled to achieve a first-class education and entrance into professional life, by the liberal help of the exhibitions and scholarships which he had gained in his early youth; where marriage was held in as high honour as in ancient Jewish times; where the pride of race was encouraged (of course I do not refer to the nonsensical sentiment of the present day, that goes under that name); where the weak could find a welcome and a refuge in celibate monasteries or sisterhoods, and lastly, where the better sort of emigrants and refugees from other lands were invited and welcomed, and their descendants naturalised. ([http://galton.org/books/hereditary-genius/text/html/galton-1869-genius394.html p. 362])&lt;ref name="HereditaryGenius" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Galton invented the term ''[[eugenics]]'' in 1883 and set down many of his observations and conclusions in a book, ''[[Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galton.org/books/human-faculty/|title=Inquiries into Human Faculty and its Development by Francis Galton|work=galton.org|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that a scheme of 'marks' for family merit should be defined, and early marriage between families of high rank be encouraged by provision of monetary incentives. He pointed out some of the tendencies in British society, such as the late marriages of eminent people, and the paucity of their children, which he thought were ''[[dysgenics|dysgenic]]''. He advocated encouraging eugenic marriages by supplying able couples with incentives to have children. On 29 October 1901, Galton chose to address eugenic issues when he delivered the second Huxley lecture at the Royal Anthropological Institute.&lt;ref name="Gilham"/&gt;

''[[The Eugenics Review]]'', the journal of the Eugenics Education Society, commenced publication in 1909. Galton, the Honorary President of the society, wrote the foreword for the first volume.&lt;ref name="Gilham" /&gt; The First International Congress of Eugenics was held in July 1912. [[Winston Churchill]] and Carls Elliot were among the attendees.&lt;ref name="Gilham" /&gt;

== Model for population stability ==
[[File:Sir Francis Galton, 1890s.jpg|thumb|left|Sir Francis Galton, 1890s]]
Galton's formulation of regression and its link to the bivariate normal distribution can be traced to his attempts at developing a mathematical model for population stability. Although Galton's first attempt to study Darwinian questions,  ''Hereditary Genius'', generated little enthusiasm at the time, the text led to his further studies in the 1870s concerning the inheritance of physical traits.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stigler|first=Stephen M.|date=1 July 2010|title=Darwin, Galton and the Statistical Enlightenment|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-985X.2010.00643.x/abstract|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A|volume=173|issue=3|pages=469–482|doi=10.1111/j.1467-985X.2010.00643.x|issn=1467-985X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text contains some crude notions of the concept of regression, described in a qualitative matter. For example, he wrote of dogs: "If a man breeds from strong, well-shaped dogs, but of mixed pedigree, the puppies will be sometimes, but rarely, the equals of their parents. they will commonly be of a mongrel, nondescript type, because ancestral peculiarities are apt to crop out in the offspring." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJB9AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI#v=onepage|title=Hereditary Genius: An Inquiry Into Its Laws and Consequences|last=Galton|first=Sir Francis|date=1 January 1914|publisher=Macmillan|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=57|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion created a problem for Galton, as he could not reconcile the tendency of a population to maintain a normal distribution of traits from generation to generation with the notion of inheritance. It seemed that a large number of factors operated independently on offspring,  leading to the normal distribution of a trait in each generation. However, this provided no explanation as to how a parent can have a significant impact on his offspring, which was the basis of inheritance.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Statistics: The Measurement of Uncertainty Before 1900|last=Stigler|first=Stephen|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Cambridge and London|pages=265–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galton's solution to this problem was presented in his Presidential Address at the September 1885 meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], as he was serving at the time as President of Section H: Anthropology.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galton|first=Francis|year=1885|title=Opening address as President of the Anthropology Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, September 10th, 1885, at Aberdeen|journal=Nature|volume=32|pages=507–510}}&lt;/ref&gt; The address was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]],'' and Galton further developed the theory in  "Regression toward mediocrity in hereditary stature" and "Hereditary Stature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galton|first=Francis|year=1886|title=Regression Towards Mediocrity in Hereditary Stature|journal=The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|volume=15|pages=246–263|doi=10.2307/2841583}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galton|first=Francis|year=1886|title=Hereditary stature|journal=Nature|volume=33|pages=295–298|doi=10.1038/033295c0|bibcode=1886Natur..33..295.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An elaboration of this theory was published in 1889 in ''Natural Inheritance.'' There were three key developments that helped Galton develop this theory: the  development of the law of error in 1874-1875, the formulation of an empirical law of reversion in 1877, and the development of a mathematical framework encompassing regression using human population data during 1885.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Galton's development of the law of regression to the mean, or reversion, was due to insights from the [[Bean machine|quincunx]] and his studies of sweet peas. While Galton had previously invented the quincunx prior to February 1874, the 1877 version of the quincunx had a new feature that helped Galton demonstrate that a normal mixture of normal distributions is also normal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Galton demonstrated this using a new version of quincunx, adding chutes to the apparatus to represent reversion. When the pellets passed through the curved chutes (representing reversion) and then the pins (representing family variability), the result was a stable population. On Friday 19 February 1877 Galton gave a lecture entitled "Typical Laws of Heredity" at the [[Royal Institution]] in London.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galton|first=Francis|year=1877|title=Typical laws of heredity|journal=Nature|volume=15|pages=492–495, 512–514, 532–533|bibcode=1877Natur..15..492.|doi=10.1038/015492a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this lecture, he posed that there must a counteracting force to maintain population stability. However, this model required a much larger degree of intergenerational natural selection than was plausible.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In 1875, Galton started growing sweet peas and addressed the Royal Institution on his findings on 9 February 1877.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  He found that each group of progeny seeds followed a normal curve, and the curves were equally disperse. Each group was not centered about the parent's weight, but rather at a weight closer to the population average. Galton called this reversion, as every progeny group was distributed at a value that was closer to the population average than the parent. The deviation from the population average was in the same direction, but the magnitude of the deviation was only one-third as large. In doing so, Galton demonstrated that there was variability among each of the families, yet the families combined to produce a stable, normally distributed population. When Galton addressed the [[British association for the advancement of science]] in 1885, he said of his investigation of sweet peas, "I was then blind to what I now perceive to be the simple explanation of the phenomenon."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Galton was able to further his notion of regression by collecting and analyzing data on human stature. Galton asked for help of mathematician J. Hamilton Dickson in investigating the geometric relationship of the data. He determined that the regression coefficient did not ensure population stability by chance, but rather that the regression coefficient, conditional variance, and population were interdependent quantities related by a simple equation.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Thus Galton identified that the linearity of regression was not coincidental but rather was a necessary consequence of population stability.

The model for population stability resulted in Galton's formulation of the Law of Ancestral Heredity.  This law, which was published in ''Natural Inheritance,'' states that the two parents of an offspring jointly contribute one half of an offspring's heritage, while the other, more-removed ancestors constitute a  smaller proportion of the offspring's heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bulmer|first=Michael|year=1998|title=Galton's law of ancestral heredity|journal=Heredity|volume=81|pages=579–585|doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6884180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galton viewed reversion as a spring, that when stretched, would return the distribution of traits back to the normal distribution. He concluded that evolution would have to occur via discontinuous steps, as reversion would neutralize any incremental steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillham|first=Nicholas|year=2001|title=Evolution by Jumps: Francis Galton and William Bateson and the Mechanism of Evolutionary Change|journal=Genetics|volume=159 | issue = 4 |pages=1383–1392}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendel's]] principles were rediscovered in 1900, this resulted in a fierce battle between the followers of Galton's Law of Ancestral Heredity, the biometricians, and those who advocated Mendel's principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillham|first=Nicholas|date=9 August 2013|title=The Battle Between the Biometricians and the Mendelians: How Sir Francis Galton's Work Caused his Disciples to Reach Conflicting Conclusions About the Hereditary Mechanism|journal=Sci &amp; Educ|volume=24|pages=61–75|doi=10.1007/s11191-013-9642-1|bibcode=2015Sc&amp;Ed..24...61G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical test of pangenesis and Lamarckism==
Galton conducted wide-ranging inquiries into heredity which led him to challenge Charles Darwin's hypothesis of [[pangenesis]]. Darwin had proposed as part of this model that certain particles, which he called "[[gemmules]]" moved throughout the body and were also responsible for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Galton, in consultation with Darwin, set out to see if they were transported in the blood. In a long series of experiments in 1869 to 1871, he transfused the blood between dissimilar breeds of rabbits, and examined the features of their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s216074.htm Science Show&amp;nbsp;– 25/11/00: Sir Francis Galton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He found no evidence of characters transmitted in the transfused blood.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=116–118}}

Darwin challenged the validity of Galton's experiment, giving his reasons in an article published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' where he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, in the chapter on Pangenesis in my ''[[Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any circulating system. It is, indeed, obvious that the presence of gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood. The fundamental laws of growth, reproduction, inheritance, &amp;c., are so closely similar throughout the whole organic kingdom, that the means by which the gemmules (assuming for the moment their existence) are diffused through the body, would probably be the same in all beings; therefore the means can hardly be diffusion through the blood. Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. R. 1871. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1751&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=1 Pangenesis]. ''Nature. A Weekly Illustrated Journal of Science'' 3 (27 April): 502-503.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Galton explicitly rejected the idea of the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] ([[Lamarckism]]), and was an early proponent of "hard heredity" {{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=105–107}} through selection alone. He came close to rediscovering Mendel's particulate theory of inheritance, but was prevented from making the final breakthrough in this regard because of his focus on continuous, rather than discrete, traits (now known as [[polygenic]] traits). He went on to found the [[Biostatistics|biometric]] approach to the study of heredity, distinguished by its use of statistical techniques to study continuous traits and population-scale aspects of heredity.

This approach was later taken up enthusiastically by [[Karl Pearson]] and [[W.F.R. Weldon]]; together, they founded the highly influential journal ''[[Biometrika]]'' in 1901.  ([[R.A. Fisher]] would later show how the biometrical approach could be reconciled with the Mendelian approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=R|last2=Pettersson|first2= M |author3-last= Carlborg|author3-first= C|title=A century after Fisher: time for a new paradigm in quantitative genetics|journal=Trends in Genetics|date=23 October 2013|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2013.09.006|volume=29|pages=669–676|pmid=24161664}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The statistical techniques that Galton invented (correlation, regression—see below) and phenomena he established (regression to the mean) formed the basis of the biometric approach and are now essential tools in all the social sciences.

== Anthropometric Laboratory at the 1884 International Health Exhibition ==
In 1884, London hosted the International Health Exhibition. This exhibition placed much emphasis on highlighting Victorian developments in sanitation and public health, and allowed the nation to display its advanced public health outreach, compared to other countries at the time. Francis Galton took advantage of this opportunity to set up his anthropometric laboratory. He stated that the purpose of this laboratory was to “show the public the simplicity of the instruments and methods by which the chief physical characteristics of man may be measured and recorded.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galton|first=Francis|date=1 January 1885|title=On the Anthropometric Laboratory at the Late International Health Exhibition.|journal=The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|volume=14|pages=205–221|doi=10.2307/2841978|jstor=2841978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory was an interactive walk-through in which physical characteristics such as height, weight, and eyesight, would be measured for each subject after payment of an admission fee. Upon entering the laboratory, a subject would visit the following stations in order. First, they would fill out a form with personal and family history (age, birthplace, marital status, residence, and occupation), then visit stations that recorded hair and eye color, followed by the keenness, color-sense, and depth perception of sight. Next, they would examine the keenness, or relative acuteness, of hearing and highest audible note of their hearing followed by an examination of their sense of touch. However, because the surrounding area was noisy, the apparatus intended to measure hearing was rendered ineffective by the noise and echoes in the building. Their breathing capacity would also be measured, as well as their ability to throw a punch. The next stations would examine strength of both pulling and squeezing with both hands. Lastly, subjects' heights in various positions (sitting, standing, etc.) as well as arm span and weight would be measured.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One excluded characteristic of interest was the size of the head. Galton notes in his analysis that this omission was mostly for practical reasons. For instance, it would not be very accurate and additionally it would require much time for women to disassemble and reassemble their hair and bonnets.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anthropometric Laboratory|last=Galton|first=Francis|publisher=William Clowes|year=1884|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patrons would then be given a souvenir containing all their biological data, while Galton would also keep a copy for future statistical research.

Although the laboratory did not employ any revolutionary measurement techniques, it was unique because of the simple logistics of constructing such a demonstration within a limited space and have it quickly and efficiently be able to gather all the necessary data. The laboratory itself was a see-through (lattice-walled) fenced off gallery measuring 36 feet long by 6 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton had to make the process as simple as possible for people to understand. As a result, subjects were taken through the laboratory in pairs so that explanations could be given to two at a time, also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative to go through all the tests first, encouraging the other. With this design, the total time spent in the exhibit was fourteen minutes for each pair.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Galton states that the measurements of human characteristics are useful for two reasons. First, he states that measuring physical characteristics is useful in order to ensure, on a more domestic level, that children are developing properly. A useful example he gives for the practicality of these domestic measurements is regularly checking a child's eyesight, in order to correct any deficiencies early on. The second use for the data from his anthropometric laboratory is for statistical studies. He comments on the usefulness of the collected data to compare attributes across occupations, residences, races, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The exhibit at the health exhibition allowed Galton to collect a large amount of raw data from which to conduct further comparative studies. He had 9,337 respondents, each measured in 17 categories, creating a rather comprehensive statistical database.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the conclusion of the International Health Exhibition, Galton used these data to confirm in humans his theory of linear regression, posed after studying sweet peas. The accumulation of this human data allowed him to observe the correlation between forearm length and height, head width and head breadth, and head length and height. With these observations he was able to write “Co-relations and their Measurements, chiefly from Anthropometric Data".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillham|first=Nicholas W.|title=SIR FRANCIS GALTON AND THE BIRTH OF EUGENICS.|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=680dfded-8555-4f4c-8ca6-97be86e6f945%40sessionmgr103&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=104&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&amp;AN=6262806|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|volume=35|pages=83–102|doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.35.102401.090055|pmid=11700278|year=2001}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this publication, Galton defined what co-relation as a phenomenon that occurs when "the variation of the one [variable] is accompanied on the average by more or less variation of the other, and in the same direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galton|first=Francis|date=1 January 1888|title=Co-Relations and Their Measurement, Chiefly from Anthropometric Data|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|volume=45|pages=135–145|doi=10.1098/rspl.1888.0082|jstor=114860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovations in statistics and psychological theory==

===Historiometry===
The method used in ''Hereditary Genius'' has been described as the first example of [[historiometry]]. To bolster these results, and to attempt to make a distinction between 'nature' and 'nurture' (he was the first to apply this phrase to the topic), he devised a questionnaire that he sent out to 190 [[Fellows of the Royal Society]]. He tabulated characteristics of their families, such as [[birth order]] and the occupation and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] of their parents. He attempted to discover whether their interest in science was 'innate' or due to the encouragements of others. The studies were published as a book, ''English men of science: their nature and nurture'', in 1874. In the end, it promoted the [[nature versus nurture]] question, though it did not settle it, and provided some fascinating data on the sociology of scientists of the time.

===The lexical hypothesis===
Sir Francis was the first scientist to recognise what is now known as the [[lexical hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="personality determinants"&gt;{{cite book | title=Personality: Determinants, Dynamics, and Potentials | publisher=Cambridge University Press |author1=Caprara, G. V. |author2= Cervone, D. |last-author-amp=yes | year=2000 | location=New York | page=68 | isbn=0-521-58310-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the idea that the most salient and socially relevant personality differences in people's lives will eventually become encoded into language. The hypothesis further suggests that by sampling language, it is possible to derive a comprehensive taxonomy of human [[personality traits]].

===The questionnaire===
Galton's inquiries into the mind involved detailed recording of people's subjective accounts of whether and how their minds dealt with phenomena such as [[visual memory|mental imagery]]. To better elicit this information, he pioneered the use of the [[questionnaire]]. In one study, he asked his fellow members of the Royal Society of London to describe mental images that they experienced. In another, he collected in-depth surveys from eminent scientists for a work examining the effects of nature and nurture on the propensity toward scientific thinking.&lt;ref name="Clauser"&gt;Clauser, Brian E. (2007). '' The Life and Labors of Francis Galton: A review of Four Recent Books About the Father of Behavioral Statistics''. 32(4), p. 440–444.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variance and standard deviation===
Core to any statistical analysis is the concept that measurements vary: they have both a [[central tendency]], or mean, and a spread around this central value, or [[variance]]. In the late 1860s, Galton conceived of a measure to quantify normal variation: the [[standard deviation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chad Denby |url=http://www.sciencetimeline.net/1866.htm |title=Science Timeline |publisher=Science Timeline |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galton was a keen observer. In 1906, visiting a livestock fair, he stumbled upon an intriguing contest. An ox was on display, and the villagers were invited to guess the animal's weight after it was slaughtered and dressed. Nearly 800 participated, and Galton was able to study their individual entries after the event. Galton stated that "the middlemost estimate expresses the ''vox populi'', every other estimate being condemned as too low or too high by a majority of the voters",&lt;ref&gt;Galton, F., "[http://galton.org/essays/1900-1911/galton-1907-vox-populi.pdf Vox Populi]", ''Nature'', 7 March 1907&lt;/ref&gt; and reported this value (the [[median]], in terminology he himself had introduced, but chose not to use on this occasion) as 1,207 pounds. To his surprise, this was within 0.8% of the weight measured by the judges. Soon afterwards, in response to an enquiry, he reported&lt;ref&gt;"[http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/galton/search/essays/pages/galton-1907-ballot-box_1.htm The Ballot Box]", ''Nature'', 28 March 1907&lt;/ref&gt; the mean of the guesses as 1,197 pounds, but did not comment on its improved accuracy.  Recent archival research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wallis | first1 = Kenneth F | year = 2014 | title = Revisiting Francis Galton's forecasting competition | journal = Statistical Science | volume = 29 | pages = 420–424 | doi = 10.1214/14-STS468 | arxiv = 1410.3989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has found some slips in transmitting Galton's calculations to the original article in ''Nature'': the median was actually 1,208 pounds, and the dressed weight of the ox 1,197 pounds, so the mean estimate had zero error.  James Surowiecki&lt;ref&gt;Surowiecki, James (2004). ''The Wisdom of Crowds''. Random House, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; uses this weight-judging competition as his opening example: had he known the true result, his conclusion on the wisdom of the crowd would no doubt have been more strongly expressed.

The same year, Galton suggested in a letter to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' a better method of cutting a round cake by avoiding making radial incisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://galton.org/essays/1900-1911/galton-1906-cake.pdf|title=Cutting a Round Cake on Scientific Principles (Letters to the Editor)|author=Francis Galton|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|page=173|date=20 December 1906|issue=1938|volume=75|doi=10.1038/075173c0 |bibcode=1906Natur..75..173G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental derivation of the normal distribution===
[[File:Quincunx (Galton Box) - Galton 1889 diagram.png|thumb|Galton's 1889 illustration of the quincunx or [[bean machine]].]]
Studying variation, Galton invented the quincunx, a [[pachinko]]-like device also known as the [[bean machine]], as a tool for demonstrating the [[law of error]] and the [[normal distribution]].{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=4}}

===Bivariate normal distribution===
He also discovered the properties of the [[bivariate normal distribution]] and its relationship to [[regression analysis]].

===Correlation and regression===

In 1846, the French physicist [[Auguste Bravais]] (1811–1863) first developed what would become the correlation coefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bravais | first1 = A | year = 1846 | title = Analyse mathématique sur les probabilités des erreurs de situation d'un point |trans-title=Mathematical analysis of the probabilities of errors in a point's location | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5516293p/f261.image | journal = Mémoires presents par divers savants à l'Académie des Sciences de l'Institut de France. Sciences Mathématiques et Physiques | volume = 9 | pages = 255–332 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After examining forearm and height measurements, Galton independently rediscovered the concept of [[correlation]] in 1888&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galton | first1 = Francis | year = 1888 | title = Co-relations and their measurement, chiefly from anthropometric data | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ki0nL-JWNGsC&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London | volume = 45 | pages = 135–145 | doi=10.1098/rspl.1888.0082}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=191–196}} and demonstrated its application in the study of heredity, anthropology, and psychology.&lt;ref name="Clauser"/&gt; Galton's later statistical study of the probability of extinction of surnames led to the concept of [[Galton–Watson process|Galton–Watson stochastic processes]].{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=182–184}} This is now a core of modern statistics and regression.

Galton invented the use of the regression line{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=184}} and for the choice of r (for reversion or regression) to represent the correlation coefficient.&lt;ref name="Clauser"/&gt;

In the 1870s and 1880s he was a pioneer in the use of [[normal distribution|normal theory]] to fit [[histogram]]s and [[Ogive (statistics)|ogives]] to actual tabulated data, much of which he collected himself: for instance [[big data|large samples]] of sibling and parental height. Consideration of the results from these empirical studies led to his further insights into evolution, natural selection, and regression to the mean.

===Regression to mediocrity===
Galton was the first to describe and explain the common phenomenon of [[regression toward the mean]], which he first observed in his experiments on the size of the seeds of successive generations of sweet peas.

The conditions under which regression toward the mean occurs depend on the way the term is mathematically defined. Galton first observed the phenomenon in the context of [[simple linear regression]] of data points. Galton&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Natural Inheritance|last = Galton|first = F|publisher = Macmillan|year = 1889|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the following model: pellets fall through a ''[[quincunx]]'' or "[[bean machine]]" forming a normal distribution centered directly under their entrance point. These pellets could then be released down into a second gallery (corresponding to a second measurement occasion. Galton then asked the reverse question "from where did these pellets come?"
&lt;blockquote&gt;The answer was not "on average directly above". Rather it was "on average, more towards the middle", for the simple reason that there were more pellets above it towards the middle that could wander left than there were in the left extreme that could wander to the right, inwards (p. 477) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Darwin, Galton and the Statistical Enlightenment|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-985X.2010.00643.x/abstract|journal = Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A|date = 1 July 2010|issn = 1467-985X|pages=469–482|volume = 173|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-985X.2010.00643.x|first = Stephen M.|last = Stigler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Theories of perception===
Galton went beyond measurement and summary to attempt to explain the phenomena he observed. Among such developments, he proposed an early theory of ranges of sound and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], and collected large quantities of anthropometric data from the public through his popular and long-running Anthropometric Laboratory, which he established in 1884, and where he studied over 9,000 people.&lt;ref name="Gilham"&gt;Gillham, Nicholas Wright (2001). A Life of Sir Francis Galton: From African Exploration to the Birth of Eugenics, Oxford University Press. {{isbn|0-19-514365-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1985 that these data were analysed in their entirety.

===Differential psychology===
Galton's study of human abilities ultimately led to the foundation of [[differential psychology]] and the formulation of the first mental tests. He was interested in measuring humans in every way possible. This included measuring their ability to make sensory discrimination which he assumed was linked to intellectual prowess. Galton suggested that individual differences in general ability are reﬂected in performance on relatively simple sensory capacities and in speed of reaction to a stimulus, variables that could be objectively measured by tests of sensory discrimination and reaction
time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Arthur R.|title=Galton's Legacy to Research on Intelligence|journal=Journal of Biosocial Science|date=April 2002|volume=34 | issue = 2 |pages=145–172|doi=10.1017/s0021932002001451}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also measured how quickly people reacted which he later linked to internal wiring which ultimately limited intelligence ability. Throughout his research Galton assumed that people who reacted faster were more intelligent than others.

===Composite photography===
Galton also devised a technique called "[[composite portrait]]ure" (produced by superimposing multiple photographic portraits of individuals' faces registered on their eyes) to create an average face (see [[averageness]]). In the 1990s, a hundred years after his discovery, much psychological research has examined the [[attractiveness]] of these faces, an aspect that Galton had remarked on in his original lecture. Others, including [[Sigmund Freud]] in his work on dreams, picked up Galton's suggestion that these composites might represent a useful metaphor for an [[Ideal type]] or a [[concept]] of a "[[natural kind]]" (see [[Eleanor Rosch]])—such as Jewish men, criminals, patients with tuberculosis, etc.—onto the same photographic plate, thereby yielding a blended whole, or "composite", that he hoped could generalise the facial appearance of his subject into an "average" or "central type".&lt;ref name=Galton1883/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galton | first1 = F | year = 1878 | title = Composite portraits | url = http://www.galton.org/essays/1870-1879/galton-1879-jaigi-composite-portraits.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland | volume = 8 | pages = 132–142 | doi=10.2307/2841021}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also entry ''Modern physiognomy'' under [[Physiognomy]]).

This work began in the 1880s while the Jewish scholar [[Joseph Jacobs]] studied anthropology and statistics with Francis Galton. Jacobs asked Galton to create a composite photograph of a Jewish type.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Akiva Novak. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UeiMt7Yzb1MC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100 ''Realism, photography, and nineteenth-century''] Cambridge University Press, 2008 {{isbn|0-521-88525-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Jacobs' first publications that used Galton's composite imagery was "The Jewish Type, and Galton's Composite Photographs," ''Photographic News'', 29, (24 April 1885): 268–269.

Galton hoped his technique would aid medical diagnosis, and even criminology through the identification of typical criminal faces. However, his technique did not prove useful and fell into disuse, although after much work on it including by photographers [[Lewis Hine]] and [[John L. Lovell]] and [[Arthur Batut]].

==Fingerprints==
In a [[Royal Institution]] paper in 1888 and three books (''[[Finger Prints (book)|Finger Prints]]'', 1892; ''Decipherment of Blurred Finger Prints'', 1893; and ''Fingerprint Directories'', 1895),&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, Barbara Gardner., Robert Gardner, and Dennis Shortelle. Encyclopedia of Forensic Science: a Compendium of Detective Fact and Fiction. Westport, Conn.: Oryx, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Galton estimated the probability of two persons having the same [[fingerprint]] and studied the heritability and racial differences in fingerprints. He wrote about the technique (inadvertently sparking a controversy between Herschel and Faulds that was to last until 1917), identifying common pattern in fingerprints and devising a classification system that survives to this day.

The method of identifying criminals by their fingerprints had been introduced in the 1860s by Sir [[William James Herschel]] in India, and their potential use in forensic work was first proposed by Dr [[Henry Faulds]] in 1880, but Galton was the first to place the study on a scientific footing, which assisted its acceptance by the courts.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=35}} Galton pointed out that there were specific types of fingerprint patterns. He described and classified them into eight broad categories: 1: plain arch, 2: tented arch, 3: simple loop, 4: central pocket loop, 5: double loop, 6: lateral pocket loop, 7: plain whorl, and 8: accidental.&lt;ref name="innes"&gt;{{Cite book

==Final years==

[[File:Sir Francis Galton by Charles Wellington Furse.jpg|thumb|''Sir Francis Galton'' by [[Charles Wellington Furse]], given to the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], London in 1954]]
In an effort to reach a wider audience, Galton worked on a novel entitled ''Kantsaywhere'' from May until December 1910. The novel described a utopia organised by a eugenic religion, designed to breed [[Fitness (biology)|fitter]] and smarter humans. His unpublished notebooks show that this was an expansion of material he had been composing since at least 1901. He offered it to [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] for publication, but they showed little enthusiasm. Galton wrote to his niece that it should be either "smothered or superseded". His niece appears to have burnt most of the novel, offended by the love scenes, but large fragments survived,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/search/pearson/vol3a/pages/vol3a_0470.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617174551/http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/search/pearson/vol3a/pages/vol3a_0470.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 June 2006|title=Life of Francis Galton by Karl Pearson Vol 3a : image 470|date=17 June 2006|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was published online by University College, London.&lt;ref name="DigiTool 1996"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://digitool-b.lib.ucl.ac.uk:8881/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=1034926|title=The Eugenic College of Kantsaywhere|last=Galton|first=Francis|date=20 August 1996|publisher=University College London|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|format=link to PDF|orig-year=1910|website=DigiTool|accessdate=15 May 2017}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galton|first=Francis|last2=Sargent|first2=Lyman Tower|year=2001|title=The Eugenic College of Kantsaywhere|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/the-eugenic-college-of-kantsaywhere/oclc/5542769084|journal=Utopian Studies|publisher=Penn State University Press|volume=12|issue=2|pages=191–209|issn=1045-991X|jstor=20718325|oclc=5542769084|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and impact==
Over the course of his career Galton received many  awards, including the [[Copley Medal]] of the Royal Society (1910). He received in 1853 the Founder's Medal, the highest award of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], for his explorations and map-making of southwest Africa. He was elected a member of the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] in 1855 and made a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1860. His autobiography also lists:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Galton, Francis|title=Memories of My Life: |year=1909|location=New York|publisher=E. P.

Galton was knighted in 1909. His statistical heir [[Karl Pearson]], first holder of the Galton Chair of Eugenics at [[University College, London]] (now Galton Chair of Genetics), wrote a three-volume biography of Galton, in four parts, after his death {{Harv|Pearson|1914, 1924, 1930}}. In the early days of [[IQ classification|IQ testing]], [[Lewis Terman]] estimated that Galton's childhood [[IQ]] was about 200, based on the fact that he consistently performed mentally at roughly twice his chronological age {{Harv|Forrest|1974}}. (This follows the original definition of IQ as mental age divided by chronological age, rather than the modern definition based on the [[standard distribution]] and [[standard deviation]].)

The flowering plant genus ''[[Galtonia]]'' was named in his honour.

'''HONOReform''' (Hepatitis Outbreaks National Organization for Reform) – is a [[patient advocacy]] organization that seeks to promote adherence to [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] safety guidelines and increase governmental oversight of [[outpatient]] medical facilities.  In addition to promoting lessons learned from outbreaks of [[hepatitis C]], the organization advocates for a more compassionate response to large scale medical disasters.&lt;ref name="HONOReform - About Us"&gt;[http://75.126.152.5/~hardtime/HONOR/aboutus.html HONOReform—About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

HONOReform was founded by patients and families impacted by a [[Nebraska]] outbreak of hepatitis C in which 99 cancer patients were infected when doctors and nurses at their oncology clinic were found to have reused syringes.  For years it remained the largest outbreak of hepatitis C in American healthcare history, though similar [[Tragedy (event)|tragedies]] continue to occur.

Since 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented 33 outbreaks of [[hepatitis B]] and C as a result of negligent injection safety practices in nonhospital healthcare settings. In January 2009, the ''Annals of Internal Medicine'' noted over 60,000 patients have been verified by the CDC to be potentially exposed to hepatitis in the outbreaks and that these outbreaks are likely only "the tip of the iceberg".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/150/1/33 Annals of Internal Medicine: Nonhospital Health Care–Associated Hepatitis B and C Virus Transmission: United States, 1998–2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/02/25/eveningnews/main3875991.shtml CBS Evening News: Hepatitis C Danger In Your MD's Office?—February 25, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
HONOReform was founded by Evelyn McKnight, Dr. Tom McKnight, and Travis Bennington, all of Fremont, Nebraska.  Evelyn McKnight is an [[audiologist]] who was battling a recurrence of [[breast cancer]] when she learned she had been infected with hepatitis C because improper injection safety protocols at the Fremont Cancer Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlc.state.ne.us/epubs/L3790/B067-2007.pdf State of Nebraska: Hepatitis C Prevention &amp; Strategic Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

During chemotherapy treatments, medical professionals access multi-dose bags of saline to flush patient ports.  Outbreaks occur as a result of doctors and nurses reusing syringes, contaminating the saline bag with the blood of multiple patients.

Tom McKnight – Evelyn’s husband – is a local [[family practice]] physician who helped uncover the outbreak when some of his patients were found to have hepatitis C. Travis Bennington is a local attorney who represented 19 of the 99 Nebraska patients in their malpractice claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://75.126.152.5/~hardtime/HONOR/staff.html HONOReform—Founders and Staff]&lt;/ref&gt;

HONOReform was founded in 2007 using settlement funds Evelyn McKnight secured in her [[malpractice]] trial.  HONOReform was established to advocate  patient justice, safety, and compassion by promoting the lessons learned from hepatitis outbreaks.&lt;ref name="HONOReform - About Us"/&gt;&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123371129728046131#articleTabs%3Darticle Wall Street Journal—Lax Needle Use Raises Alarm, February 4, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission &amp; Activities==
Since its formation, HONOReform advocates have lobbied the [[U.S. Congress]] and federal health agencies for greater oversight of private physician offices and other stand-alone healthcare facilities.  HONOReform  has fought to raise awareness to widely accepted healthcare standards that call for using syringes and similar products once.&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt;

In addition to its federal advocacy efforts, HONOReform leaders have helped other communities recover from similar outbreaks.  Following the [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] tragedy, Evelyn McKnight testified before the [[Nevada Legislature]]’s Legislative Committee on Health Care and also took part in numerous community healing and education events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lvrj.com/news/16936876.html Las Vegas Review-Journal: 'Message of hope' on hepatitis, March 23, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lvrj.com/news/16976731.html Las Vegas Review-Journal:  Patients vent emotions, March 25, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The One and Only Campaign===
The Safe Injection Practices Coalition (SIPC) is a partnership of healthcare-related organizations, patient advocacy organizations, industry partners, and other public health partners, led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC Foundation is the convening partner of the Coalition, formed to promote safe injection practices in all U.S. healthcare settings. In 2009, SIPC Founding Partners developed the One &amp; Only Campaign—a public health education and awareness campaign—aimed at both healthcare providers and patients to advance and promote safe injection practices. 
Although safe injection practices represent very basic infection control measures, CDC continues to identify and investigate outbreaks associated with poor practices. Breakdowns in proper infection control have involved providers reusing needles, syringes or single-dose medication vials, all of which are meant for one patient and one procedure. These breaches can cause irreparable damage, exposing patients to bloodborne illnesses such as hepatitis and HIV, and to life-threatening bacterial infections. 
Through targeted education and awareness efforts, the One &amp; Only Campaign empowers patients and healthcare providers to insist on nothing less than safe injections – every time, for every patient.

==Other notable outbreaks==

===Las Vegas, Nevada===
In February 2008, the largest patient notification of its kind occurred when 40,000 patients of the [[Endoscopy Center of Southern Nevada]] in Las Vegas were urged to be tested for hepatitis and HIV.&lt;ref&gt;(Las Vegas Review Journal, February 28, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, an additional 10,000 patients of the center along with 13,000 patients at the Desert Shadow Endoscopy Center were advised to be tested. To date, a total of 114 confirmed cases of hepatitis C have been linked to the outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,443878,00.html FOXNews: 114 Hepatitis Cases Traced to 2 Las Vegas Medical Clinics, October 24, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grand Rapids, Michigan===
More than 16,000 patients of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] [[dermatologist]] Dr. Robert W. Stokes were issued letters urging them to be tested for hepatitis, HIV and other diseases.  Dr. Stokes was accused of reusing on patients syringes and sutures intended for one-time use in one patient.  Stokes is currently in federal prison, serving a 10-and-a-half-year sentence for insurance fraud, and has had his medical license revoked.  Patients impacted by the outbreak pushed  for  a number of reforms including greater  penalties for such actions and a measure that would prohibit or severely limit the reuse of medical devices.&lt;ref&gt;This resulted in Governor Jennifer Granholm signing Public Act 25, effective 3/26/10, making reuse of single use medical devices a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years or a fine of not more than $50,000.00, or both.

===Laurinburg, North Carolina===
In September 2008, 1,200 patients at a cardiology practice in [[Laurinburg, North Carolina]] were warned of exposure to hepatitis, HIV and other diseases because of unsafe medical practices at the office of Dr. Matthew Block. To date, eight patients have been tested positive for hepatitis in relation to procedures at the clinic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://75.126.152.5/~hardtime/HONOR/fay100308.html Archive: Fayetteville Observer: At least 600 people have been tested for hepatitis C in Scotland and Robeson, October 3, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdhhs.gov/pressrel/2008/2008-8-29-Public-health-contacting-patients.htm North Carolina State Department of Health: Public Health contacting patients after potential hepatitis C exposure in Scotland County cardiology clinic]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9247">The '''International Network of Health Promoting Hospitals and Health Services''' (HPH) is a network initiated by the [[World Health Organization]] - Regional Office for Europe. It is based on the [[health promotion]] philosophy of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as outlined in the WHO [[Ottawa Charter]] for Health Promotion (WHO 1986) which was re-confirmed in the [http://www.who.int/healthpromotion/conferences/6gchp/bangkok_charter/en/index.html WHO Bangkok Charter for Health Promotion in a Globalised World] (WHO 2005).
The Ottawa Charter lists five action areas for health promotion, of which health care services are one:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The responsibility for health promotion in health services is shared among individuals, community groups, health professionals, health service institutions and governments.

They must work together towards a health care system which contributes to the pursuit of health. The role of the health sector must move increasingly in a health promotion direction, beyond its responsibility for providing clinical and curative services. Health services need to embrace an expanded mandate which is sensitive and respects cultural needs. This mandate should support the needs of individuals and communities for a healthier life, and open channels between the health sector and broader social, political, economic and physical environmental components.

Reorienting health services also requires stronger attention to health research as well as changes in professional education and training. This must lead to a change of attitude and organization of health services which refocuses on the total needs of the individual as a whole person. (Ottawa Charter, WHO 1986)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accordingly, HPHs aim at improving the health gain of hospitals (and other health services) by a bundle of strategies targeting
* patients
* staff and
* the community

== Short history of HPH ==

Based on the [[Ottawa Charter]], the first conceptual developments on HPH started in 1988. A first model project [http://www.hph-hc.cc/projects.php#hah "Health and Hospital"], was initiated in 1989 at the Rudolfstiftung Hospital in Vienna, Austria, and successfully finished in 1996. [http://www.univie.ac.at/lbimgs/projekte/publ1.html 10 model documents] (in German language) summarise the learnings from the pilot project and are available online to guide hospital projects related to health promotion.

In 1990, the '''WHO International Network of Health Promoting Hospitals''' was founded as a multi city action plan of the [http://www.euro.who.int/healthy-cities WHO Healthy Cities Network]. In 1991, the HPH network, which was in the beginning an alliance of experts, launched its first policy document, the [http://www.euro.who.int/document/IHB/hphbudadecl.pdf Budapest Declaration on Health Promoting Hospitals]. This document introduces the HPH concept and target groups - patients, staff, community - as well as related HPH strategies and action areas.

In order to implement HPH on a broader basis, a [http://www.hph-hc.cc/projects.php#hph European Pilot Hospital Project] of Health Promoting Hospitals was initiated in 1993, and finished in 1997. 20 hospitals from 11 European countries participated, 19 of which finished the project successfully. 
Also in 1993, the first &lt;br /&gt;[http://www.hph-hc.cc/conferences.php international HPH conference] was organised, and the first [http://www.hph-hc.cc/newsletter.php international HPH Newsletter] was published.

Since 1995, national and regional networks of HPH, all coordinated by their own national or regional coordinating centres, are being implemented and developed in order to disseminate HPH to as many hospitals and health care institutions as possible. The development of the HPH networks called for a new policy document: The [http://www.euro.who.int/document/IHB/hphviennarecom.pdf Vienna Recommendations on Health Promoting Hospitals] were launched in 1997.

In 2009, HPH has become a global movement with national and regional networks, individual member hospitals and health promotion initiatives on all continents. HPH member hospitals currently exist in Australia, [http://www.oengk.net/ Austria], [http://www.ulb.ac.be/assoc/hps/ Belgium], [http://www.sham.com.br/ Brasil], Bulgaria, [http://www.clinhp.org/ifile/Vol4_Issue2_p70_75.pdf Canada], Czech Republic, [http://www.forebyggendesygehuse.dk/ Denmark], England, [http://www.tai.ee// Estonia], [http://www.hph.tutka.net/ Finland], [http://www.cfes.sante.fr/HPS/home.asp France], [http://www.dngfk.de/ Germany], Greece, [http://www.hphallireland.org/south.asp Ireland], [http://www.retehphitalia.it/ Italy], Japan, [http://blog.daum.net/ilovemedical Korea], [http://www.liepajasslimnica.lv/ Latvia], [http://www.kmu.lt/SSL/ Lithuania], Northern Ireland, Norway, [http://www.am.edu.pl//hph/ Poland], Russian Federation, Scotland, Serbia, [http://www.alexandrahealth.com.sg/ Singapore], [http://www.provita.sk/ Slovakia], Slovenia, Spain, [http://www.natverket-hfs.se/ Sweden], [http://www.healthhospitals.ch/ Switzerland], Taiwan, and the USA.

In addition, several '''task forces''' develop specific HPH concepts, strategies and tools on specific subjects or for specific clinical areas:
* [http://www.hpps.net/ Health Promoting Psychiatric Services]
* Migrant Friendly and Culturally Competent Hospitals
* [http://www.meyer.it/layHPH_duecolonne.asp?IDCategoria=695 Health promotion for children and adolescents in hospitals]
* HPH and European Network of Smoke-free Hospitals and Health Services: Tobacco Free United

== HPH: The concept ==

HPH combines a vision, a concept, and a set of [http://www.hph-hc.cc/Downloads/HPH-Publications/wp-strategies-final.pdf 18 core strategies] and [http://www.euro.who.int/document/E88584.pdf 5 standards]. 

In accordance to health promotion theory, the HPH standards and strategies are based on the principles of the settings approach, [[empowerment]] and enablement, participation, a holistic concept of health (somato-psycho-social concept of health), intersectoral cooperation, equity, [[sustainability]], and multi-strategy (Rootman et al. 2001). 

In order to realise the full potential of the comprehensive HPH approach for increasing the health gain of hospital patients, staff, and the community, HPH needs to be supported by an organisational structure: Support from top management, a management structure that embraces all organisatial units, a budget, specific aims and targets, action plans, projects, and programs, standards, guidelines and other tools for implementing health promotion into everyday business. This needs to be supported by evaluation and monitoring, professional training and education, research and dissemination. 

One way to implement HPH in a hospital or other health care organisation is by linking HPH aims and targets with [[quality management]], thus understanding [[health promotion]] as one specific quality aspect in hospitals and health care. Ideally any managerial or professional decision in an HPH should also consider the health / disease impact of that decision, together with other decision criteria (e.g. effectiveness, sustainability).

== HPH structure ==

The international HPH Network was initiated by and is affiliated to [http://www.euro.who.int/healthpromohosp/ WHO-Euro].
It is governed by a steering committee which is composed of elected national / regional network coordinators and representatives of WHO and [[WHO Collaborating Centres]] who support the network internationally:

The [http://www.hphnet.org WHO Collaborating Centre on Evidence Based Health Promotion in Hospitals], Copenhagen, Denmark, runs the International HPH Network secretariat and is responsible for managing and growing membership as well as developing and implementing the internal and external communications strategy.
The [http://www.hph-hc.cc WHO Collaborating Centre on Health Promotion in Hospitals and Health Care], Vienna, Austria, is amongst others responsible for the scientific preparation of the annual international HPH conferences and for the scientific editing of the semi-annual [http://www.hph-hc.cc/newsletter.php HPH Newsletter].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5144">The nation of [[Liechtenstein]] has a [[universal health care system]] with decentralized, [[free market]] elements through [[Health insurance mandate|mandated]] [[health insurance]] coverage for every person residing in the country (not necessarily just every citizen). 

==Overview==
Broadly speaking, individuals shop around for their own private health insurance plan, known by the abbreviation 'OKP', with government registered and regulated companies. Various supplementary services with varying private contribution rates exist for those with special healthcare needs.&lt;ref name=migr&gt;[http://www.llv.li/pdf-llv-scg-broschuere.englisch.pdf Welcome to Liechtenstein - Information for Migrants]&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic plans cover specialist treatments from neighboring nations such as [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]], though patients share some costs. Regular health check-ups with [[general practitioners]] are covered completely, with no out-of-pocket expenses.&lt;ref name=migr/&gt;

All permanent residents of Liechtenstein must contribute to the national healthcare fund, and employers must register their staff with the health insurance fund. Employees and employers pay into the healthcare fund. Dependent family members are covered by the contributions paid by employed family members. The unemployed, old age pensioners and people on long-term sickness benefit or maternity leave do not have to pay healthcare contributions. Self-employed persons must make their own contributions. The national healthcare fund covers most medical services including treatment by specialists, hospitalisation, prescriptions, pregnancy and childbirth and rehabilitation.

There are around 64 general practitioners and consultants in Liechtenstein, though they are very competent and well-trained. General practitioners (GPs) prescribe drugs, treat acute and chronic illnesses, and provide preventive care and health education. Consultants are senior doctors who have completed a higher level of training, and tend to specialize in one field, such as gynecology, oncology, pediatrics, and dermatology. GPs must refer a patient to a consultant.

Liechtenstein has one hospital, the National Hospital, situated in the capital, [[Vaduz]], which is run in conjunction with private doctors specializing in internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, obstetrics, and psychiatry. Emergency care at the hospital is free and available even to people who are not insured. There are numerous health centers throughout the country which only provide outpatient care, but offer a wide variety of specialist services, such as general practice, maternity care, pediatrics, and dental care, as well as laboratory, radiology, and other diagnostic services. They can also provide emergency medical aid. Outside Vaduz, every town has an emergency service operated by GPs and specialists, and doctors trained in emergency medicine travel with the ambulance service. Pharmacies are located throughout the country, and a pharmacist is on call at all times. 

For serious illnesses or complicated bone fractures, patients are transferred to specialized hospitals in [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]].

There are private clinics staffed and managed by independent doctors and specialists operating in Liechtenstein. There are also about 26 dentists in the country, and all dental care is private and must be paid for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.europe-cities.com/en/633/liechtenstein/health/ |title=Health in Liechtenstein.

[[Abortion in Liechtenstein]] is illegal in almost all circumstances and is punishable by prison terms for the woman and the physician. An attempt to legalize it in 2011 was defeated by voters. In April and November 2012, the [[Landtag of Liechtenstein|Landtag]] failed to advance proposals to relax abortion laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwangerschaftsabbruch: Status quo unverändert |first= |last= |url=http://www.vaterland.li/index.cfm?ressort=home&amp;source=lv&amp;id=17802 |newspaper=Vaterland |date=26 April 2012 |language=German |trans-title=Abortion: Status quo unaltered |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwangerschaftsabbruch ist noch nicht vom Tisch |first= |last= |url=http://www.vaterland.li/index.cfm?id=20654&amp;source=lv&amp;ressort=liechtenstein |newspaper=Vaterland |date=6 November 2012 |language=German|trans-title=Abortion is not yet on the table |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of those who are infected never develop symptoms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs400/en/|title=Herpes simplex virus|last=|first=|date=31 January 2017|website=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms, when they occur, may include watery [[blister]]s in the [[skin]] or [[mucous membranes]] of the mouth, lips, nose, or genitals.&lt;ref name=Sherris /&gt; Lesions heal with a [[Coagulation|scab]] characteristic of herpetic disease. Sometimes, the viruses cause very mild or atypical symptoms during outbreaks. However, they can also cause more troublesome forms of [[herpes simplex]]. As [[neurotropic virus|neurotropic and neuroinvasive viruses]], HSV-1 and -2 persist in the body by hiding from the [[immune system]] in the [[cell (biology)|cell]] bodies of [[neurons]]. After the initial or primary infection, some infected people experience [[wikt:sporadic|sporadic]] episodes of viral reactivation or outbreaks. In an outbreak, the virus in a nerve cell becomes active and is transported via the neuron's [[axon]] to the skin, where virus replication and shedding occur and cause new sores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Herpes simplex | url=http://www.dermnetnz.org/viral/herpes-simplex.html | date=2006-09-16 | publisher=DermNet NZ&amp;nbsp;— New Zealand Dermatological Society | accessdate=2006-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission==
{{Main|Herpes simplex}}

HSV-1 and HSV-2 are transmitted by contact with an infected person who has reactivations of the virus. HSV-2 is periodically shed in the human genital tract, most often asymptomatically. Most sexual transmissions occur during periods of asymptomatic shedding.&lt;ref name="pmid24671939"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schiffer JT, Mayer BT, Fong Y, Swan DA, Wald A | title = Herpes simplex virus-2 transmission probability estimates based on quantity of viral shedding | journal = J R Soc Interface | volume = 11 | issue = 95 | pages = 20140160 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24671939 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2014.0160 | pmc = 4006256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asymptomatic reactivation means that the virus causes atypical, subtle, or hard-to-notice symptoms that are not identified as an active herpes infection, so acquiring the virus is possible even if no active HSV blisters or sores are present. In one study, daily genital swab samples found HSV-2 at a median of 12–28% of days among those who have had an outbreak, and 10% of days among those suffering from asymptomatic infection, with many of these episodes occurring without visible outbreak ("subclinical shedding").&lt;ref name=Johnstonetal_2011&gt;{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Johnston C, Koelle DM, Wald A | title = HSV-2: in pursuit of a vaccine. | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 121 | issue = 12 | pages = 4600–9 |date=Dec 2011 | doi = 10.1172/JCI57148 | PMID = 22133885 | pmc=3223069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, 73 subjects were randomized to receive [[valaciclovir]] 1 g daily or placebo for 60 days each in a two-way [[crossover design]]. A daily swab of the genital area was self-collected for HSV-2 detection by polymerase chain reaction, to compare the effect of valaciclovir versus placebo on asymptomatic viral shedding in immunocompetent, HSV-2 seropositive subjects without a history of symptomatic genital herpes infection. The study found that valaciclovir significantly reduced shedding during subclinical days compared to placebo, showing a 71% reduction; 84% of subjects had no shedding while receiving valaciclovir versus 54% of subjects on placebo.

Herpes simplex viruses can affect areas of skin exposed to contact with an infected person (although shaking hands with an infected person does not transmit this disease). An example of this is [[herpetic whitlow]], which is a herpes infection on the fingers.

===Viral structure===
[[File:A-Tail-like-Assembly-at-the-Portal-Vertex-in-Intact-Herpes-Simplex-Type-1-Virions-ppat.1002961.s003.ogv|thumb|A three-dimensional reconstruction and animation of a tail-like assembly on HSV-1 capsid]]
[[File:HSV-1-EM.png|thumb|3D reconstruction of the HSV-1 capsid]]

Animal herpes viruses all share some common properties. The structure of herpes viruses consists of a relatively large, double-stranded, linear [[DNA]] [[genome]] encased within an [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] protein cage called the [[capsid]], which is wrapped in a [[lipid bilayer]] called the [[Envelope (biology)|envelope]]. The envelope is joined to the capsid by means of a [[Viral tegument|tegument]]. This complete particle is known as the [[virion]].&lt;ref name="pmid16814597"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mettenleiter TC, Klupp BG, Granzow H | title = Herpesvirus assembly: a tale of two membranes | journal = Curr. Opin. Microbiol. | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 423–9 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16814597 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2006.06.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HSV-1 and HSV-2 each contain at least 74 genes (or [[open reading frames]], ORFs) within their genomes,&lt;ref name="pmid16490275"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McGeoch DJ, Rixon FJ, Davison AJ | title = Topics in herpesvirus genomics and evolution | journal = Virus Res. | volume = 117 | issue = 1 | pages = 90–104 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16490275 | doi = 10.1016/j.virusres.2006.01.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although speculation over gene crowding allows as many as 84 unique protein coding genes by 94 putative ORFs.&lt;ref name="pmid15266111"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rajcáni J, Andrea V, Ingeborg R | title = Peculiarities of herpes simplex virus (HSV) transcription: an overview | journal = Virus Genes | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 293–310 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15266111 | doi = 10.1023/B:VIRU.0000025777.62826.92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These genes encode a variety of proteins involved in forming the capsid, tegument and envelope of the virus, as well as controlling the replication and infectivity of the virus. These genes and their functions are summarized in the table below.

The genomes of HSV-1 and HSV-2 are complex and contain two unique regions called the long unique region (U&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) and the short unique region (U&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;). Of the 74 known ORFs, U&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; contains 56 viral genes, whereas U&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; contains only 12.&lt;ref name="pmid16490275"/&gt; Transcription of HSV genes is catalyzed by [[RNA polymerase II]] of the infected host.&lt;ref name="pmid16490275"/&gt; [[Immediate early gene]]s, which encode proteins that regulate the expression of early and late viral genes, are the first to be expressed following infection. [[early protein|Early gene]] expression follows, to allow the synthesis of [[enzyme]]s involved in [[DNA replication]] and the production of certain [[Viral envelope|envelope]] [[glycoprotein]]s. Expression of late genes occurs last; this group of genes predominantly encode proteins that form the virion particle.&lt;ref name="pmid16490275"/&gt;

Five proteins from (U&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) form the viral capsid - [[HHV capsid portal protein|UL6]], UL18, UL35, UL38, and the major capsid protein UL19.&lt;ref name="pmid16814597"/&gt;

===Cellular entry===
[[File:HSV replication.png|thumb|right|350px|A simplified diagram of HSV replication]]
Entry of HSV into a host cell involves several [[glycoprotein]]s on the surface of the enveloped virus binding to their [[transmembrane receptor]]s on the cell surface. Many of these receptors are then pulled inwards by the cell, which is thought to open a ring of three gHgL heterodimers stabilizing a compact conformation of the gB glycoprotein, so that it springs out and punctures the cell membrane.&lt;ref name="ACSID-P"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clarke RW| title = Forces and Structures of the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Entry Mechanism | journal = ACS Infectious Diseases | volume = 1 | issue = 9 | pages = 403–415 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.1021/acsinfecdis.5b00059 | url = https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/257391 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The envelope covering the virus particle then fuses with the cell membrane, creating a pore through which the contents of the viral envelope enters the host cell.

The sequential stages of HSV entry are analogous to [[Viral entry|those of other viruses]]. At first, complementary receptors on the virus and the cell surface bring the viral and cell membranes into proximity. Interactions of these molecules then form a stable entry pore through which the viral envelope contents are introduced to the host cell. The virus can also be [[Endocytosis|endocytosed]] after binding to the receptors, and the fusion could occur at the [[endosome]]. In electron micrographs, the outer leaflets of the viral and cellular lipid bilayers have been seen merged;&lt;ref name="Subramanian_17299053"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Subramanian RP, Geraghty RJ | title = Herpes simplex virus type 1 mediates fusion through a hemifusion intermediate by sequential activity of glycoproteins D, H, L, and B | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 104 | issue = 8 | pages = 2903–8 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17299053 | pmc = 1815279 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0608374104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this hemifusion may be on the usual path to entry or it may usually be an arrested state more likely to be captured than a transient entry mechanism.

In the case of a herpes virus, initial interactions occur when two viral envelope glycoprotein called glycoprotein C (gC) and glycoprotein B (gB)  bind to a cell surface particle called [[heparan sulfate]]. Next, the major receptor binding protein, glycoprotein D (gD), binds specifically to at least one of three known entry receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akhtar J, Shukla D | title = Viral entry mechanisms: Cellular and viral mediators of herpes simplex virus entry | journal = FEBS Journal | volume = 276 | issue = 24 | pages = 7228–7236 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19878306 | pmc = 2801626 | doi = 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07402.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cell receptors include herpesvirus entry mediator ([[TNFRSF14|HVEM]]), [[nectin]]-1 and 3-O sulfated heparan sulfate. The nectin receptors usually produce cell-cell adhesion, to provide a strong point of attachment for the virus to the host cell.&lt;ref name="ACSID-P"/&gt; These interactions bring the membrane surfaces into mutual proximity and allow for other glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope to interact with other cell surface molecules.
Once bound to the HVEM, gD changes its conformation and interacts with viral glycoproteins H (gH) and L (gL), which form a complex. The interaction of these membrane proteins may result in a hemifusion state. gB interaction with the gH/gL complex creates an entry pore for the viral capsid.&lt;ref name="Subramanian_17299053"/&gt; gB interacts with [[glycosaminoglycan]]s on the surface of the host cell. {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Genetic inoculation===
After the viral capsid enters the cellular [[cytoplasm]], it is transported to the [[cell nucleus]]. Once attached to the nucleus at a nuclear entry pore, the capsid ejects its DNA contents via the capsid portal. The capsid portal is formed by 12 copies of portal protein, UL6, arranged as a ring; the proteins contain a [[leucine zipper]] sequence of [[amino acids]], which allow them to adhere to each other.&lt;ref name="pmid17188319"&gt;

===Immune evasion===
HSV evades the immune system through interference with MHC class I [[antigen presentation]] on the cell surface, by blocking the [[transporter associated with antigen processing]] (TAP) induced by the secretion of [[ICP-47]] by HSV.&lt;ref&gt;Abbas et al (2009) Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Elsevier Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In the host cell, TAP transports digested viral antigen epitope peptides from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum, allowing these epitopes to be combined with MHC class I molecules and presented on the surface of the cell. Viral epitope presentation with MHC class I is a requirement for activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), the major effectors of the cell-mediated immune response against virally-infected cells. ICP-47 prevents initiation of a CTL-response against HSV, allowing the virus to survive for a protracted period in the host.

===Replication===
[[File:Herpes simplex virus pap test.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] showing the viral [[cytopathic effect]] of HSV (multinucleation, ground glass chromatin)]]
Following infection of a cell, a cascade of herpes virus proteins, called immediate-early, [[Early protein|early]], and late, is produced. Research using [[flow cytometry]] on another member of the herpes virus family, [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus]], indicates the possibility of an additional [[Lytic cycle|lytic stage]], delayed-late.&lt;ref name="PMID_17005685"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adang LA, Parsons CH, Kedes DH | title = Asynchronous Progression through the Lytic Cascade and Variations in Intracellular Viral Loads Revealed by High-Throughput Single-Cell Analysis of Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus Infection | journal = J. Virol. | volume = 80 | issue = 20 | pages = 10073–82 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17005685 | pmc = 1617294 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.01156-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These stages of lytic infection, particularly late lytic, are distinct from the latency stage. In the case of HSV-1, no protein products are detected during latency, whereas they are detected during the lytic cycle.

The early proteins transcribed are used in the regulation of genetic replication of the virus. On entering the cell, an α-TIF protein joins the viral particle and aids in immediate-early [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. The virion host shutoff protein (VHS or UL41) is very important to viral replication.&lt;ref name="pmid12083325"/&gt; This enzyme shuts off protein synthesis in the host, degrades host [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]], helps in viral replication, and regulates [[gene expression]] of viral proteins. The viral genome immediately travels to the nucleus, but the VHS protein remains in the cytoplasm.&lt;ref name="pmid16940547"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Taddeo B, Roizman B | title = The Virion Host Shutoff Protein (UL41) of Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Is an Endoribonuclease with a Substrate Specificity Similar to That of RNase A | journal = J.

The late proteins form the capsid and the receptors on the surface of the virus. Packaging of the viral particles&amp;nbsp;— including the [[genome]], core and the capsid - occurs in the nucleus of the cell. Here, [[concatemer]]s of the viral genome are separated by cleavage and are placed into formed capsids. HSV-1 undergoes a process of primary and secondary envelopment. The primary envelope is acquired by budding into the inner nuclear membrane of the cell. This then fuses with the outer nuclear membrane, releasing a naked capsid into the cytoplasm. The virus acquires its final envelope by budding into cytoplasmic [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Granzow H, Klupp BG, Fuchs W, Veits J, Osterrieder N, Mettenleiter TC | title = Egress of Alphaherpesviruses: Comparative Ultrastructural Study | journal = J.

===Latent infection===
HSVs may persist in a quiescent but persistent form known as latent infection, notably in [[Ganglion|neural ganglia]].&lt;ref name=Sherris /&gt; HSV-1 tends to reside in the [[trigeminal ganglion|trigeminal ganglia]], while HSV-2 tends to reside in the [[sacral ganglia]], but these are tendencies only, not fixed behavior. During latent infection of a cell, HSVs express [[HHV Latency Associated Transcript|latency-associated transcript]] (LAT) [[RNA]]. LAT regulates the host cell genome and interferes with natural cell death mechanisms. By maintaining the host cells, LAT expression preserves a reservoir of the virus, which allows subsequent, usually symptomatic, periodic recurrences or "outbreaks" characteristic of nonlatency. Whether or not recurrences are symptomatic, viral shedding occurs to infect a new host. A protein found in neurons may bind to herpes virus DNA and regulate [[Virus latency|latency]]. Herpes virus DNA contains a gene for a protein called ICP4, which is an important [[Transactivation|transactivator]] of genes associated with lytic infection in HSV-1.&lt;ref name="PMID17555596"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pinnoji RC, Bedadala GR, George B, Holland TC, Hill JM, Hsia SC | title = Repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor/neuronal restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) can regulate HSV-1 immediate-early transcription via histone modification | journal = Virol.

==Evolution==

The herpes simplex 1 genomes can be classified into six [[clade]]s.&lt;ref name=Kolb2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kolb AW, Ané C, Brandt CR | year = 2013 | title = Using HSV-1 genome phylogenetics to track past human migrations | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 10| page = e76267 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0076267 | pmid=24146849 | pmc=3797750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of these occur in [[East Africa]], one in [[East Asia]] and one in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. This suggests that the virus may have originated in East Africa. The [[most recent common ancestor]] of the Eurasian strains appears to have evolved ~60,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Bowden2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bowden R, Sakaoka H, Ward R, Donnelly P | year = 2006 | title = Patterns of Eurasian HSV-1 molecular diversity and inferences of human migrations | url = | journal = Infect Genet Evol | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 63–74 | doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2005.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The East Asian HSV-1 isolates have an unusual pattern that is currently best explained by the two waves of migration responsible for the peopling of [[Japan]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Herpes simplex 2 genomes can be divided into two groups: one is globally distributed and the other is mostly limited to [[sub Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name=Burrel2017&gt;Burrel S, Boutolleau D, Ryu D, Agut H, Merkel K, Leendertz FH, Calvignac-Spencer S (2017) Ancient recombination events between human herpes simplex viruses. Mol Biol Evol {{doi|10.1093/molbev/msx113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The globably distributed [[genotype]] has undergone an ancient recombination with herpes simplex 1.

The mutation rate has been estimated to be ~1.38×10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; substitutions/site/year.&lt;ref name="Kolb2013"/&gt; In clinical setting, the mutations in either the thymidine kinase gene or DNA polymerase gene has caused resistance to [[aciclovir]]. However, most of the mutations occur in the thymidine kinase gene rather than the DNA polymerase gene.&lt;ref name=Hussin2013&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hussin A, Md, Nor NS, Ibrahim N | year = 2013 | title = Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of induced acyclovir-resistant clinical isolates of herpes simplex virus type 1 | url = | journal = Antivir Res | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 306–313 | doi = 10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.09.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another analysis has estimated the mutation rate in the herpes simplex 1 genome to be 1.82×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; nucleotide substitution per site per year.&lt;ref name=Norberg2011&gt;Norberg P, Tyler S, Severini A, Whitley R, Liljeqvist JÅ, Bergström T (2011) A genome-wide comparative evolutionary analysis of herpes simplex virus type 1 and varicella zoster virus. PLoS One 6(7):e22527. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0022527}}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis placed the most recent common ancestor of this virus ~710,000 years ago.

==Treatment==
:''For more details on treatment of herpes simplex virus, see [[Herpes simplex#Management|Herpes simplex]].''

The herpes viruses establish lifelong infections (thus cannot be eradicated from the body).&lt;ref name="CDC2017Bas2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/Herpes/STDFact-Herpes.htm|title=STD Facts – Genital Herpes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the virus is a [[Pathogen|foreign pathogen]], a [[Immune system|human body's immune system]] as well as its specialty [[antigen]] naturally diminishes the virus.&lt;ref name="CDC2017Bas2" /&gt;

Treatment usually involves general-purpose [[antiviral drug]]s that interfere with viral replication, reduce the physical severity of outbreak-associated lesions, and lower the chance of transmission to others. Studies of vulnerable patient populations have indicated that daily use of antivirals such as aciclovir&lt;ref name="pmid21991950"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kimberlin DW, Whitley RJ, Wan W, Powell DA, Storch G, Ahmed A, Palmer A, Sánchez PJ, Jacobs RF, Bradley JS, Robinson JL, Shelton M, Dennehy PH, Leach C, Rathore M, Abughali N, Wright P, Frenkel LM, Brady RC, Van Dyke R, Weiner LB, Guzman-Cottrill J, McCarthy CA, Griffin J, Jester P, Parker M, Lakeman FD, Kuo H, Lee CH, Cloud GA | title = Oral acyclovir suppression and neurodevelopment after neonatal herpes | journal = N.

==Alzheimer's disease==

A 2018 retrospective study from Taiwan on 33,000 patients found that being infected with herpes simplex virus increased the risk of dementia 2.56 times (95% CI: 2.3-2.8) in patients not receiving anti-herpetic medications (2.6 times for HSV-1 infections  and 2.0 times for HSV-2 infections).

==Multiplicity reactivation==
Multiplicity reactivation (MR) is the process by which viral genomes containing inactivating damage interact within an infected cell to form a viable viral genome. MR was originally discovered with the bacterial virus bacteriophage T4, but was subsequently also found with pathogenic viruses including influenza virus, HIV-1, adenovirus simian virus 40, vaccinia virus, reovirus, poliovirus and herpes simplex virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michod RE, Bernstein H, Nedelcu AM | title = Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens | journal = Infection, Genetics and Evolution | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 267–285 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18295550 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When HSV particles are exposed to doses of a DNA damaging agent that would be lethal in single infections, but are then allowed to undergo multiple infection (i.e. two or more viruses per host cell), MR is observed. Enhanced survival of HSV-1 due to MR occurs upon exposure to different DNA damaging agents, including [[methyl methanesulfonate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Das SK | title = Multiplicity reactivation of alkylating agent damaged herpes simplex virus (type I) in human cells | journal = Mutation Research | volume = 105 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 15–18 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6289091 | doi=10.1016/0165-7992(82)90201-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; trimethylpsoralen (which causes inter-strand DNA cross-links),&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hall JD, Scherer K | title = Repair of psoralen-treated DNA by genetic recombination in human cells infected with herpes simplex virus | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 41 | issue = 12 Pt 1 | pages = 5033–5038 | year = 1981 | pmid = 6272987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coppey J, Sala-Trepat M, Lopez B | title = Multiplicity reactivation and mutagenesis of trimethylpsoralen-damaged herpes virus in normal and Fanconi's anaemia cells | journal = Mutagenesis | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 67–71 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2541311 | doi = 10.1093/mutage/4.1.67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and UV light.&lt;ref name=Selsky&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Selsky CA, Henson P, Weichselbaum RR, Little JB | title = Defective reactivation of ultraviolet light-irradiated herpesvirus by a Bloom's syndrome fibroblast strain | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 39 | issue = 9 | pages = 3392–3396 | year = 1979 | pmid = 225021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After treatment of genetically marked HSV with trimethylpsoralen, recombination between the marked viruses increases, suggesting that trimethylpsoralen damage stimulates recombination.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt; MR of HSV appears to partially depend on the host cell recombinational repair machinery since skin fibroblast cells defective in a component of this machinery (i.e. cells from Bloom’s syndrome patients) are deficient in MR.&lt;ref name=Selsky /&gt; These observations suggest that MR in HSV infections involves genetic recombination between damaged viral genomes resulting in production of viable progeny viruses. HSV-1, upon infecting host cells, induces inflammation and oxidative stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Valyi-Nagy T, Olson SJ, Valyi-Nagy K, Montine TJ, Dermody TS | title = Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Latency in the Murine Nervous System is Associated with Oxidative Damage to Neurons | journal = Virology | volume = 278 | issue = 2 | pages = 309–321 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11118355 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1006/viro.2000.0678 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it appears that the HSV genome may be subjected to oxidative DNA damage during infection, and that MR may enhance viral survival and virulence under these conditions.

==Use as an anti-cancer agent==

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Impetigo''' is a [[bacterial infection]] that involves the superficial [[skin]].&lt;ref name=Ib2015/&gt; The most common presentation is yellowish crusts on the face, arms, or legs.&lt;ref name=Ib2015/&gt; Less commonly there may be [[bullous|large blisters]] which affect the groin or armpits.&lt;ref name=Ib2015&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ibrahim|first1=F|last2=Khan|first2=T|last3=Pujalte|first3=GG|title=Bacterial Skin Infections.|journal=Primary care|date=December 2015|volume=42|issue=4|pages=485–99|pmid=26612370|doi=10.1016/j.pop.2015.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lesions may be painful or itchy.&lt;ref name=AFP2014/&gt; [[Fever]] is uncommon.&lt;ref name=AFP2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
It is typically due to either ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' or ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''.&lt;ref name=AFP2014/&gt; Risk factors include attending [[day care]], crowding, [[malnutrition|poor nutrition]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[contact sport]]s, and breaks in the skin such as from [[mosquito bite]]s, [[eczema]], [[scabies]], or [[herpes]].&lt;ref name=AFP2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adam2002&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adams|first1=BB|title=Dermatologic disorders of the athlete.|journal=Sports Medicine|date=2002|volume=32|issue=5|pages=309–21|pmid=11929358|doi=10.2165/00007256-200232050-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt; With contact it can spread around or between people.&lt;ref name=AFP2014/&gt; Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and appearance.&lt;ref name=AFP2014/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

===Contagious impetigo===
This most common form of impetigo, also called nonbullous impetigo, most often begins as a red sore near the nose or mouth which soon breaks, leaking [[pus]] or fluid, and forms a honey-colored [[wound healing|scab]],&lt;ref name=Cole&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cole C, Gazewood J|title=Diagnosis and treatment of impetigo|journal=Am Fam Physician|date=2007|volume=75|issue=6|pages=859–64|pmid=17390597|issn=0002-838X|doi=|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/0315/p859.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430100234/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/0315/p859.html|archivedate=2015-04-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a red mark which heals without leaving a scar. Sores are not painful, but they may be itchy. [[Lymph node]]s in the affected area may be swollen, but fever is rare. Touching or scratching the sores may easily spread the infection to other parts of the body.&lt;ref name=Mayo&gt;{{cite web|url= http://semj.sums.ac.ir/vol8/jul2007/impetigo.htm|title= Impetigo|author= Mayo Clinic staff|date= 5 October 2010|work= Mayo Clinic Health Information|publisher= Mayo Clinic|accessdate= 25 August 2012|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121128081224/http://semj.sums.ac.ir/vol8/jul2007/impetigo.htm|archivedate= 28 November 2012|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ulcer (dermatology)|Skin ulcers]] with [[erythema|redness]] and scarring also may result from scratching or abrading the skin.

===Bullous impetigo===
[[File:Bullous impetigo1.jpg|thumb|[[Bullous impetigo]] after the bulla have broken]]
[[Bullous impetigo]], mainly seen in children younger than 2 years, involves painless, fluid-filled [[blister]]s, mostly on the arms, legs, and trunk, surrounded by red and itchy (but not sore) skin. The blisters may be large or small. After they break, they form yellow scabs.&lt;ref name=Mayo/&gt;

===Ecthyma===
[[Ecthyma]], the nonbullous form of impetigo, produces painful fluid- or pus-filled sores with redness of skin, usually on the arms and legs, become [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcers]] that penetrate deeper into the [[dermis]]. After they break open, they form hard, thick, gray-yellow scabs, which sometimes leave scars. Ecthyma may be accompanied by swollen [[lymph node]]s in the affected area.&lt;ref name= Mayo/&gt;

==Causes==
Impetigo is primarily caused by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', and sometimes by ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; &amp; Mitchell, Richard N. (2007). ''Robbins Basic Pathology'' (8th ed.). Saunders Elsevier. pp. 843 {{ISBN|978-1-4160-2973-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[bullous]] and nonbullous are primarily caused by ''S. aureus'', with ''Streptococcus ''also commonly being involved in the nonbullous form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stulberg DL, Penrod MA, Blatny RA |title=Common bacterial skin infections. |journal=American Family Physician |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=119–24 |year=2002 |pmid=12126026 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20020701/119.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104522/http://www.aafp.org/afp/20020701/119.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predisposing factors===
Impetigo is more likely to infect children ages 2–5, especially those that attend school or day care.&lt;ref name=AFP2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=school1&gt;{{cite web|title=Impetigo (school sores)|url=http://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/conditions-and-treatments/diseases-and-illnesses/impetigo-school-sores|website=www.health.govt.nz|publisher=Ministry of Health|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vic2017/&gt; 70% of cases are the nonbullous form and 30% are the bullous form.&lt;ref name=AFP2014/&gt; Other factors can increase the risk of contracting impetigo such as diabetes mellitus, dermatitis, immunodeficiency disorders, and other irritable skin disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impetigo|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/impetigo#Causes5|website=Healthline|accessdate=7 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007042532/http://www.healthline.com/health/impetigo#Causes5|archivedate=7 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impetigo occurs more frequently among people who live in warm climates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Diseases of the Human Body|last=Tamparo|first=Carol|last2=Lewis|first2=Marcia|publisher=F.A. Davis Company|year=2011|isbn=9780803625051|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission===
The [[infection]] is spread by direct contact with [[lesion]]s or with [[human nose|nasal]] [[asymptomatic carrier|carriers]]. The [[incubation period]] is 1–3 days after exposure to ''Streptococcus'' and 4–10 days for ''Staphylococcus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.in.us/isdh/23303.htm|title=ISDH: Impetigo|work=state.in.us|accessdate=11 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211025205/http://www.state.in.us/isdh/23303.htm|archivedate=11 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dried streptococci in the air are not infectious to intact skin. Scratching may spread the lesions.

==Diagnosis==
Impetigo is usually diagnosed based on its appearance. It generally appears as honey-colored scabs formed from dried [[serum (blood)|serum]], and is often found on the arms, legs, or face.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt; If a visual diagnosis is unclear a culture may be done to test for resistant bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impetigo: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000860.htm|website=medlineplus.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107092650/https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000860.htm|archivedate=2016-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
Other conditions that can result in symptoms similar to the common form include [[contact dermatitis]], [[herpes simplex virus]], [[discoid lupus]], and [[scabies]].&lt;ref name=AFP2014/&gt;

Other conditions that can result in symptoms similar to the blistering form include other [[bullous]] skin diseases, [[burn]]s, and [[necrotizing fasciitis]].&lt;ref name=AFP2014/&gt;

==Prevention==
To prevent the spread of impetigo the skin and any open wounds should be kept clean and covered. Care should be taken to keep fluids from an infected person away from the skin of a non-infected person. Washing hands, linens, and affected areas will lower the likelihood of contact with infected fluids. Scratching can spread the sores; keeping nails short will reduce the chances of spreading. Infected people should avoid contact with others and eliminate sharing of clothing or linens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-management - Impetigo - Mayo Clinic|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/impetigo/manage/ptc-20202600|website=www.mayoclinic.org|accessdate=7 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016100459/http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/impetigo/manage/ptc-20202600|archivedate=16 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with impetigo can return to school 24 hours after starting antibiotic therapy as long as their draining lesions are covered.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impetigo?search=impetigo&amp;source=search_result&amp;selectedTitle=1~119&amp;usage_type=default&amp;display_rank=1|title=Impetigo|last=Baddour|first=Larry|date=|website=UpToDate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
[[Antibiotic]]s, either as a cream or by mouth, are usually prescribed. Mild cases may be treated [[mupirocin]] ointments. In 95% of cases, a single 7-day antibiotic course results in resolution in children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7CqcE1ZrFkC&amp;pg=PA925&amp;dq=impetigo|title=Textbook of Pediatric Emergency Medicine|last=Fleisher|first=Gary R.|last2=Ludwig|first2=Stephen|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=|isbn=9781605471594|location=|pages=925|language=en|quote=|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908221933/https://books.google.com/books?id=a7CqcE1ZrFkC&amp;pg=PA925&amp;dq=impetigo|archivedate=2017-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been advocated that topical [[Antiseptic|antiseptics]] are not nearly as efficient as topical antibiotics, and therefore should not be used as a replacement.&lt;ref name=AFP2014/&gt;

More severe cases require oral antibiotics, such as [[dicloxacillin]], [[flucloxacillin]], or [[erythromycin]]. Alternatively, [[amoxicillin]] combined with [[clavulanate potassium]], [[Cephalosporin|cephalosporins]] (first-generation) and many others may also be used as an antibiotic treatment. Alternatives for people who are seriously allergic to penicillin or infections with [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphococcus aureus'']] include [[doxycycline]], [[clindamycin]], and [[Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole|trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole]]. Although doxycycline should not be used in children under the age of eight years old due to the risk of drug-induced [[Tooth discoloration|tooth discolouration]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When streptococci alone are the cause, penicillin is the drug of choice.

When the condition presents with [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]]s, [[valacyclovir]], an antiviral, may be given in case a viral infection is causing the ulcer.

===Alternative medicine===
There is not enough evidence to recommend alternative medicine such as [[tea tree oil]] or [[honey]].&lt;ref name=AFP2014/&gt;

==Prognosis==
Without treatment, individuals with impetigo typically get better within three weeks.&lt;ref name=AFP2014/&gt; Complications may include [[cellulitis]] or [[poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis]].&lt;ref name=AFP2014/&gt; [[Rheumatic fever]] does not appear to be related.&lt;ref name=AFP2014/&gt;

'''Infantile cortical hyperostosis''' is a self-limited [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] disorder of [[infant]]s that causes [[bone]] changes, [[soft tissue]] swelling and [[irritability]].  The disease may be present at birth or occur shortly thereafter. The cause is unknown.  Both familial and sporadic forms occur.  It is also known as '''Caffey disease''' or '''Caffey's disease'''.

==Presentation==
An affected infant typically has the following triad of [[Medical sign|signs]] and [[symptom]]s:  soft-tissue swelling, bone lesions, and irritability.  The swelling occurs suddenly, is deep, firm, and may be tender.  Lesions are often asymmetric and may affect several parts of the body.  Affected bones have included the [[Human mandible|mandible]], [[tibia]], [[ulna]], [[clavicle]], [[scapula]], [[rib]]s, [[humerus]], [[femur]], [[fibula]], [[Human skull|skull]], [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], and [[Metatarsus|metatarsals]]. When the mandible (lower jaw bone) is affected, infants may refuse to eat, leading to [[failure to thrive]].

==Genetics==
It has been associated with ''[[COL1A1]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid18553566"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kamoun-Goldrat A, Martinovic J, Saada J, etal |title=Prenatal cortical hyperostosis with COL1A1 gene mutation |journal=Am. J. Med. Genet. A |volume=146A |issue=14 |pages=1820–4 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18553566 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.32351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
In the early stages of infantile cortical hyperostosis, biopsy shows inflammation of the [[periosteum]] and adjacent soft tissues. After this resolves, the periosteum remains thickened, and subperiosteal immature lamellar bone can be seen on biopsy, while the [[bone marrow]] spaces contain vascular fibrous tissue. Eventually the inflammation and subperiosteal changes resolve, and hyperplasia of lamellar cortical bone can be seen.

Radiographs initially show layers of periosteal new bone formation with cortical thickening.  Periosteal new bone may cover the diaphysis of the bone, causing an increase in diameter of the bone. Over time, the periosteal new bone density increases, becoming homogenous with the underlying cortex. Eventually the bone remodels and resumes a normal appearance.
==Diagnosis==
[[File:Infantile cortical hyperostosis.jpg|thumb|Anteroposterior radiograph of the skull showed massive sclerosis of the skull bone associated with significant cortical hyperostosis and enlargement of the mandible secondary to cortical new bone formation.]]
Most infants with infantile cortical hyperostosis are diagnosed by [[physical examination]]. [[X-ray]]s can confirm the presence of bone changes and soft tissue swelling.  [[Biopsy]] of the affected areas can confirm the presence of typical [[Histopathology|histopathological]] changes.  No specific blood tests exist, but tests such as [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR) and [[alkaline phosphatase]] levels are often elevated.  A [[complete blood count]] may show [[anemia]] (low red blood cell count) and [[leukocytosis]] (high white blood cell count).  Other tests may be done to help exclude other diagnoses.  [[Obstetric ultrasonography|Ultrasound]] imaging can help diagnose [[prenatal]] cases.

===Differential diagnosis===
[[Osteomyelitis]] (bone infection), which is much more common than infantile cortical hyperostosis, must be excluded, since it requires urgent treatment.  Other diagnoses that can mimic this disorder and need to be excluded include [[physical trauma]], [[child abuse]], [[Retinol|Vitamin A]] excess, [[hyperphosphatemia]], [[prostaglandin]] E1 and E2 administration, [[scurvy]], infections (including [[syphilis]]), [[Ewing's sarcoma|Ewing sarcoma]], and [[Metastasis|metastatic]] [[neuroblastoma]].

==Prognosis==
Infantile cortical hyperostosis is a self-limited condition, meaning that the disease resolves on its own without treatment, usually within 6–9 months. Long-term deformities of the involved bones, including bony fusions and limb-length inequalities, are possible but rare.

==Epidemiology==
The disease has been reported to affect 3 per 1000 infants younger than 6 months in the United States. No predilection by race or sex has been established. Almost all cases occur by the age of 5 months.  The familial form is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion with variable [[penetrance]].  The familial form tends to have an earlier onset and is present at birth in 24% of cases, with an average age at onset of 6.8 weeks. The average age at onset for the sporadic form is 9–11 weeks.
&lt;br /&gt;
Cortical hyperostosis is a potential side effect of long-term use of [[prostaglandins]] in neonates.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis AB, Freed MD, Heymann MA, et al, “Side Effects of Therapy With Prostaglandin E1 in Infants With Critical Congenital Heart Disease,” Circulation, 1981, 64(5):893-8. [PubMed 7285304]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dr. John Caffey (1895–1978) first described infantile cortical hyperostosis in 1945.  He described a group of infants with tender swelling in the soft tissues and cortical thickenings in the skeleton, with onset of these findings during the first 3 months of life. Dr. Caffey was regarded throughout the world as the father of pediatric radiology. His classic textbook, Pediatric X-Ray Diagnosis, which was first published in 1945, has become the recognized bible and authority in its field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caffey J |title=Infantile cortical hyperostoses |journal=J.

[[File:Knee scooter 75 St CPW jeh.jpg|thumb|upright|Knee scooter in use]]

A '''knee scooter''' or '''knee walker''' is a two, three or four-wheeled alternative to [[crutches]] or a [[Walker (tool)|traditional walker]] as an ambulation aid.  It is known by many other names, such as knee coaster, knee cruiser, knee caddy, orthopaedic scooter, or leg walker.

Over the years it has taken on many forms, from small-wheeled devices suitable for indoor use to larger sturdier units capable of use outside on grass or paved surfaces.  Today’s version is usually a lightweight, foldable design that, with the knee flexed, supports the shin of the unusable limb. The opposite foot makes contact with the floor or ground, providing propulsion.

==Operation==
The objective of the scooter is to create a safe, comfortable, and easy-to-maneuver alternative to the traditional crutch. Prior to its introduction, those experiencing foot surgery, [[bunion]]ectomies, [[gout]], below the knee [[amputations]], [[diabetic]] [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcers]] and wounds, as well as foot [[sprains]], or [[fractures]] had no choice but to limit activity during rehabilitation. Their only options were crutches, a traditional walker, a [[wheelchair]] or [[bed rest]].

The scooter does have limitations that may make it unsuitable for some patients, such as those with leg injuries above or near the knee.  It cannot negotiate stairs, and is significantly heavier and more difficult to load into a vehicle than crutches.

==Rental==
As knee scooters are often used while the user recovers after surgery, they are often rented for a short period of time, usually about 4 weeks. While a Medicare E0118 code may have been present in the past for dealers to provide this to patients/beneficiaries, as changes are made to funding, many dealers have the option of renting these products directly for the short use period.  Often due to the complexities and costs, many also choose from purchasing this product as a form of cost saving options.

This page lists the reported and registered [[HIV/AIDS]] cases by reporting region.  A ''region'' may refer to a country or subdivision, national HIV records are often complicated incomplete or even nonexistent.   This list is only documented cases, not for [[List of countries by HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate|estimated cases]].   Estimated case numbers differ in significant ways: estimates are available for all areas for all years unlike hard records, and estimates attempt to quantify an epidemic in current time, whereas registered/documented cases are [[trend forecasting|behind the curve]], they have lag time to detection and represent the past rather than current situation.

Documentation of HIV transmission often present with significant holes and inconsistencies.  In the earlier years of the epidemic, especially in Africa, health systems where completely overwhelmed and millions of people died without government recordkeeping, there is little way of knowing how many people contracted HIV, to get around the problem to get the total cumulative number of HIV infections, HIV death data is taken into account in the table below where those living with HIV are summed with those died of HIV for a cumulative HIV infection figure, nevertheless, the data of credible death estimates exist only for the specific years where available.  In spite of [[data quality]] issues, all these types of data help to create an [[epidemiological]] picture.

US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] has changed reporting standards for [[AIDS-defining clinical condition|AIDS related]] deaths (again in 2014); HIV case reporting is not uniform among states that also implement their own surveillance.   Globally, some 35.3 million are living with HIV/AIDS, [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), an estimated 36 million people have died since the first cases were reported in 1981 and 1.6 million people died of HIV/AIDS in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;aids.gov/federal-resources/around-the-world/global-aids-overview/&lt;/ref&gt;  Using WHO statistics, in 2012 the number of people living with HIV was growing at a faster rate (1.98%) than worldwide human population growth (1.1% annual),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cumulative number of people with HIV is growing at roughly three times faster (3.22%).   The costs of treatment is significantly increasing burden on healthcare systems when budgets remain stagnant, causing cutoffs in funding to healthcare providers.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt;

{{quote box | width=25em| bgcolor=#B0C4DE |align=right|qalign=right|quote=&lt;div style="text-align:left;"&gt;We’re right at that razor edge.  Unless you dramatically change the infection rate...the epidemic is actually going to expand rather than shrink.  —Deborah Birx, Obama administration global AIDS coordinator &lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-02/obama-s-aids-boss-appeals-to-apax-nike-for-help-to-curb-hiv |title=Obama’s AIDS Boss Appeals to Apax, Nike for Help to Curb HIV |publisher=Bloomberg |date=5 June 2015 |accessdate=5 June 2015 |first=Simeon |last=Bennett}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  |}}

==List==
''Color code: Countries/regions in light blue have latest year HIV cases exceeding 10% of cumulative total, deep blue exceeding 20%, and pink exceeding 30%.''  These colors suggest an outbreak or insufficient reporting.  If HIV estimates are correct, government efforts to report are still hugely inadequate, only 1 in 3 HIV cases have ever been reported globally, and 1 in 7 deaths (using this list as reference). Note: Deaths in US jurisdictions include all causes.  Documented deaths may be estimated, please consult individual references sources.
''Word of caution on data below: Higher numbers on this list often reflect better reporting and data, it does not necessarily indicate (nor imply) a larger epidemic.  Reporting of HIV cases and deaths are quite often delayed by years, data here can mask HIV [[epidemic]]s.''

MEDCIN is a [[point-of-care]] terminology, intended for use in [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicom Systems|url=http://www.medicomp.com|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it includes over 280,000 clinical data elements encompassing symptoms, history, physical examination, tests, diagnoses and therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012AB MEDCIN Source Information|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/MEDCIN/|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This clinical vocabulary contains over 38 years of research and development as well as the capability to cross map to leading codification systems such as [[SNOMED CT]], [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]], [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems#ICD-9-CM|ICD-9-CM]]/[[ICD-10-CM]], [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]],  [[LOINC]], [[Current Dental Terminology|CDT]], CVX, and the [[Clinical Care Classification System|Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System]] for nursing and allied health.&lt;ref name="Whittenburg1"&gt;Whittenburg, L. (2012) The CCC system in medicomp’s point of care knowledge engine (MEDCIN) (pp.52) In Saba, V. (2012) Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System Version 2.5, 2nd Edition: User's Guide,  New York,NY: Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MEDCIN coding system is marketed for [[point-of-care documentation]].  Several [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) systems embed MEDCIN, which allows them to produce structured and numerically codified patient charts.  Such structuring enables the aggregation, analysis, and mining of clinical and practice management data related to a disease, a patient or a population.

==History==

MEDCIN was initially developed by Peter S. Goltra, founder of Medicomp Systems “as an intelligent clinical database for documentation at the time of care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=S.H.|author2=Rosenbloom, S.T. |author3=Bauer, B.A. |author4=Wahner-Roedler, D. |author5=Froehling, D.A. |author6=Bailey, K.R. |author7=Lincoln, M.J. |author8=Montella, D. |author9=Fielstein, E.M. |author10=Elkin, P.L. |title=Direct Comparison of MEDCIN® and SNOMED CT® for Representation of a General Medical Evaluation Template|journal=AMA Symposium Proceedings|year=2007|pages=75–79|pmc=2655894 |pmid=18693801}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The first few years of the development were spent in designing the structure of a knowledge engine that would enable the population of relationships between clinical events.
Since 1978, the MEDCIN database engine has been continuously refined and expanded to include concepts from clinical histories, test, physical examination, therapies and diagnoses to enable coding of complete patient encounters with the collaboration of physicians and teaching institutions such as Cornell, Harvard, and Johns Hopkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Medicomp Systems, Inc|url=http://www.medicomp.com/|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interface term"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbloom|first=S.T|author2=Brown, S.H |author3=Froehling, D. |author4=Bauer, A.B. |author5=Wahner-Roedler, D.L. |author6=Gregg, W.M |author7=Elkin, P.L.  |title=Using SNOMED CT to represent two interface terminology|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association| date=February 2009 |volume=16|issue=1|pages=81–88. doi: 10.1197/jamia.M2694.|pmid=18952944|doi=10.1197/jamia.M2694 |pmc=2605600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

=== Multiple Hierarchical Structure ===

MEDCIN data elements are organized in multiple clinical hierarchies, where users can easily navigate to a medical term by following down the tree of clinical propositions. The clinical propositions define unique intellectual clinical content. An example of such similar propositions include "wheezing which is worse during cold weather" and "wheezing which is worse with a cold" differ in meaning significantly to clinicians and therefore it enables the software to present relevant items to clinical users.&lt;ref&gt;Zanstra, P.E, van der Haring, E.J, Cornet, R, (2003)[http://www.openclinical.org/docs/ext/terminologiesNL2003.pdf Introduction of a Clinical Terminology in the Netherlands: Needs, Constraints, Opportunities.]  Depts. Medical Informatics, UMC St Radboud Nijmegen, AMC Amsterdam. pg 61&lt;/ref&gt;

This hierarchy provides an inheritance of clinical properties between data elements, which greatly enhances the capabilities of EHR systems and as well providing logical presentation structures for the clinical users.&lt;ref name='Zanstra1'&gt;Zanstra, P.E, van der Haring, E.J, Cornet, R, (2003). [http://www.openclinical.org/docs/ext/terminologiesNL2003.pdf Introduction of a Clinical Terminology in the Netherlands: Needs, Constraints, Opportunities.]  Depts. Medical Informatics, UMC St Radboud Nijmegen, AMC Amsterdam. pg 62&lt;/ref&gt;  The linkage of MEDCIN data elements through the use of describing many diagnoses in the diagnostic index creates multiple hierarchies.&lt;ref name="Zanstra1"/&gt;  The MEDCIN engine uses Intelligent Prompting and navigation tools to enable clinicians to select specific clinical terms that they need rather than having to create new terms for rapid documentation. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SNOMED and MEDCIN: Hand in Hand and Toe to Toe|url=http://www.ehrscope.com/blog/snomed-and-medcin-hand-in-hand-and-toe-to-toe/|accessdate=1 May 2013|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zanstra2"&gt;Zanstra, P.E, van der Haring, E.J, Cornet, R, (2003).

Medical Informatics, UMC St Radboud Nijmegen, AMC Amsterdam. pg 60&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enhances EHRs usability ===

MEDCIN has been designed to work as an interface terminology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gasch|first=A.|author2=Gasch, B.|title=Successfully choosing your EMR 15 crucial decisions|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Oxford|isbn=9781444320336|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;   to include components to make EHRs more usable when it is used in conjunction with proprietary physician and nursing documentation tools.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbloom, S.T, Miller, R.A., Johnson, K.B., Elkin, P.L., Brown, S.H. (2008). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17947616 A Model for Evaluating Interface Terminologies.]  Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association. 15:65–76. {{DOI|10.1197}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rosenbloom et al. (2006), investigators such as Chute et al., McDonald et al., Rose et al. and Campbell et al. have defined clinical interface terminologies as “a systematic collection of health care-related phrases (term)” (p.&amp;nbsp;277)  that supports the capturing of patient-related clinical information entered by clinicians into software programs such as clinical note capture and decision support tools.&lt;ref name='Rosenbloom'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbloom|first=S.T. |author2=Miller,R.A. |author3=Johnson, K.B.|author4=Elkin, P.L. |author5=Brown, S.H.|title=Interface Terminologies: Facilitating Direct Entry of Clinical Data into Electronic Health Record Systems|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|year=2006|volume=13|issue=3|pages=277–288|pmc=1513664|doi=10.1197/jamia.m1957|pmid=16501181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an interface terminology to be clinical usable, it has to be able to describe any clinical presentation with speed, ease of use, and accuracy for clinicians to accomplish the intended tasks (e.g. documenting patient care) when using the medical terminology.&lt;ref name='Rosenbloom'/&gt; In addition, the terms in medical terminology must have medical relationships.&lt;ref  name="Zanstra2"/&gt;  MEDCIN’s presentation engine, accomplishes this usability criteria by using the Intelligent Prompting capabilities to present a relevant list of MEDCIN clinical terms for rapid clinical documentations. Another usability feature that the MEDCIN presentation engine provides is the medical relationships of clinical terms through multiple clinical hierarchies for each MEDCIN term.&lt;ref name="Zanstra2"/&gt;

=== Support for ICD-10-CM coding ===

In August 2012, Medicomp Systems released an updated version of the software embedded with [[ICD-10 Clinical Modification|ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification)]] mappings and functionality to comply with the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM as mandated by the US Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICD-10 Code Set to Replace ICD-9|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/solutions-managing-your-practice/coding-billing-insurance/hipaahealth-insurance-portability-accountability-act/transaction-code-set-standards/icd10-code-set.page?|publisher=American Medical Association|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="medicomp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Medicomp?|url=http://www.medicomp.com/why-medicomp/|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new  version is specially designed to make the [[ICD 10|ICD-10]] more usable in the EHR systems by providing clinicians easier access to bi-directional mappings, accurate data and codes through their EHR products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicomp Releases ICD-10-CM with New Version of the Powerful MEDCIN Engine® (2011)|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/medicomp-releases-icd-10-cm-with-new-version-of-the-powerful-medcin-engine-128470243.html|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICD-10 is published by the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]]  to enable the systematic collection of morbidity and mortality data from different countries for statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coiera|first=Enrico|title=Guide to Health Informatics. 2nd edition|year=2003|publisher=Hodder Arnold|location=London, UK|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Integration to most EHRs and Legacy systems ===

MEDCIN terminology engine can be easily integrated into existing EHRs and legacy systems to enable mapping of existing terminologies and other coding systems such as [[ICD]], [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]], [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]], [[LOINC]], [[SNOMED CT]] and the [[Clinical Care Classification System|Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System]] to generate seamless codified data  at point of care.&lt;ref name="Zanstra1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="medicomp"/&gt;  MEDCIN’s interoperability features enable easy access and sharing of patient data between health care facilities.

==Interface with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems==

MEDCIN has been implemented into several commercial EHR systems as an interface terminology to support integrated care, clinical documentation, health maintenance monitoring and disease management, and the care planning functions of physicians, nurses and [[Allied health professions|allied health professionals]].&lt;ref name="interface term"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whittenburg2"&gt;Whittenburg, L. (2012) The CCC system in medicomp’s point of care knowledge engine (MEDCIN®) (pp.51-53). In Saba, V. (2012) Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System Version 2.5, 2nd Edition: User's Guide, New York,NY: Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such commercial EHR systems include EHRs from EPIC, Allscripts, Pulse, Mckesson, and the United States Department of Defence’s (DoD) EHR system, the [[AHLTA|Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA)]].


=== AHLTA ===

[[File:Screenshot of AHLTA and MEDCIN terminology engine.png|thumb|Figure 1: AHLTA and MEDCIN terminology systems]]
[[AHLTA]] is an EHR system developed for the US Department of Defense. This application uses the Medicomp’s MEDCIN terminology engine for clinical documentation purposes. &lt;span style="color: black"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/span&gt;, shows an example of the MEDCIN terminology where the physician can search for the correct terms for input into the patient note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoyt|first=R.E |author2=Sutton, M., |author3=Yoshihashi, S.A., (eds)|title=Medical informatics practical guide for the healthcare professional|url=http://remongameel.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/medicalinformatics_third_edition_bookmarked_e_book_lulu.pdf|year=2009|publisher=Lulu.com|location=Pensacola, Florida|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MEDCIN Nursing Plan of Care ==

[[File:MEDCIN nursing plan of care.png|thumb|Figure 2: MEDCIN plan of care with nursing diagnoses]]
The Nursing Plan of Care (POC)  was developed by Medicomp Systems, for the [[Clinical Care Classification System|Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System]].&lt;ref name="Whittenburg2"/&gt;  The CCC System is a standardized, coded nursing terminology that provides a unique [[Clinical Care Classification System#The CCC System Framework|framework]] and coding structure for accessing, classifying and documenting patient care by nurses and other [[Allied health professions|allied health professionals]].&lt;ref&gt;Saba, V. K. (2005). Clinical Care Classification (CCC) of Nursing Interventions. Retrieved 25 May 2013, from http://www.sabacare.com/About/.&lt;/ref&gt; The CCC is directly linked in the MEDCIN nursing POC to medical terminology with the purpose of creating patient plan of care by extracting a pool of documentation from the EHR history.&lt;ref name="Whittenburg2"/&gt; The CCC nursing terminology is integrated into the MEDCIN clinical database through a contextual hierarchical tree, providing an array of terminology standards and concepts with Intelligent Prompting capabilities of the MEDCIN engine.&lt;ref&gt;Whittenburg, L.

'''MSR - The Israel Center for Medical Simulation''' ([[Hebrew]]: מסר - המרכז הארצי לסימולציה רפואית) is [[Israel]]'s national institute for [[Simulation]]-Based [[Medical Education]] (SBME) and [[Patient Safety]] training. It is located at the [[Chaim Sheba Medical Center]] in the [[Tel HaShomer]] neighborhood of [[Ramat Gan]], in the [[Tel Aviv District]]. MSR is internationally recognized as leader in patient safety simulation-based training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssih.org/calendar/ctl/Details/Mid/50820/ItemID/2280?ContainerSrc=%5BL%5DContainers/SSH/TitleH2_Transparent Society for Simulation in Healthcare]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=2SzgAFMw0RUC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;dq=%22Israel+Center+for+Medical+Simulation%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Giwb4mFGAC&amp;sig=UqerTyZ3ETr7_Bvp60rOP5Vej3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRgJeb1drSAhVLkRQKHbI5APQ4FBDoAQhQMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Israel%20Center%20for%20Medical%20Simulation%22&amp;f=false Patient Safety in Emergency Medicine, p.288]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Israel Center for [[Medical Simulation]] (MSR) was established at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center in 2001. The Center’s purpose is to lead a nationwide effort to introduce new standards and innovative approaches to [[health care]] training and [[patient safety]] education for the benefit of the people of [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PMID|17122476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports on patient safety&lt;ref&gt;e.g., '''[https://www.nap.edu/catalog/9728/to-err-is-human-building-a-safer-health-system To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System]''', the US National Institute of Medicine report, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; have indicated that health care is far less safe than it should be, and that [[medical errors]] are the third cause of death in the US after [[heart disease]] and [[cancer]]. Simulation based [[medical education]] has been recognized as a powerful tool in addressing patient safety and quality-care training.

MSR is under the direction of Prof. [[Amitai Ziv]], MD, MHA.  He is a veteran [[combat pilot]] and [[flight instructor]] in the [[Israeli Air Force]] where he was first exposed to simulation-based training.  Prof. Ziv has testified before the [[U.S. Congress]] on MSR’s medical emergency preparedness programs.  He has briefed the [[Department of Health and Human Services|Federal Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Office of Homeland Security]], the Greater New York Hospital Association, the [[Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations]], and has presented at major medical centers including the [[Mayo Clinic]], [[Harvard University]], [[McGill University]], [[New York Presbyterian Hospital]] and [[Cleveland Clinic]]/[[Case Western Reserve]].

The 2400-square-meter center is designed as a virtual healthcare environment and encompasses the whole spectrum of medical simulation modalities. These include [[simulated patient]]s ([[role-playing]] [[actor]]s for communication and clinical skills' training), advanced task trainers (for training of complex manual skills), [[virtual reality]] surgical [[simulator]]s and computer-driven, full-body [[mannequin]]s, that enable team training for challenging and high-risk clinical conditions. State-of-the-art [[audiovisual]] equipment and [[one-way mirror]] observation booths ensure effective [[debriefing]] and constructive [[feedback]] to trainees. 

Staffed with a [[multidisciplinary]] team of 40, MSR has trained over 200,000 trainees and over 4500 instructors and raters of various health professions in a variety of courses and exams. These courses have been carried out in collaboration with major medical institutions, including Health Professional Schools, The Israel Ministry of Health, [[Israeli Defense Forces]] [[Medical Corps]], [[Emergency Medical Services]], Medical Associations, [[HMO]]’s, Major [[Hospital]]s, [[risk Management]] bodies and medical simulation, [[medical equipment]] and [[Pharmaceutical industry|Pharmaceutical]] Industries.

==MSR's Programs==
===communication skills===
[[file:מיומנויות תקשורת.png|thumb|250px|Simulation is the main tool used in practicing for the military. MSR offers a variety of training programs for military medical teams, to improve their communication capabilities in challenging military situations]]

The Simulated Patient Unit trains medical professionals in [[communication skills]] essential for their practices, to help them achieve effective and compassionate interactions with their [[patient]]s.
The unit develops and conducts a wide range of training activities and [[scenario]]s to improve and promote human skills in general, and clinical communication skills in particular.
 
MSR engages some 150 [[role-playing]] [[actors]] of various ages, from adolescents to the elderly. The actors are specially trained to represent a variety of characters found in different encounters with medical caregivers: patients, family members, team members or other colleagues.
The role-playing actors participate in a variety of simulations, each of which is a platform for learning, practicing and improving communication and clinical skills.  These include delivering bad news, obtaining informed consent, coping with refusal of treatment, apologizing for a mistake, and practicing of [[neurological]] tests on a patient, among many others.
After participating in a simulation scenario, the trainees receive [[feedback]] from the actors, their colleagues and MSR staff, based on direct observations and [[video]] recordings.

===Clinical Skills===
The advanced training wing is equipped with High Tech Patient Simulators that provide practice opportunities in a simulated, controlled medical environment.
The spectrum of medical simulation equipment used at MSR include:
*Simple simulators and various modules for practicing a range of medical procedures and indicators for quality of care
*Advanced technical simulation by means of computerized simulators and [[virtual reality]]
*Advanced, sophisticated [[simulators]] and [[medical equipment]] for training on complex [[Medicine|clinical]] situations, staff management and team work in times of emergency. Such situations include [[emergency medicine]], trauma, surgery, [[anesthesiology]] and [[intensive care]], [[cardiology]], [[gynecology]] and [[obstetrics]], [[pediatrics]], [[newborn]]s and [[preterm birth|premature babies]], [[ophthalmology]] etc.

===MSR on Wheels===
[[file:טיפול נמרץ עם יחידת מסר על גלגלים.jpg|thumb|250px|Training of [[intensive care]] with an ''MSR on wheels'' unit]]
Established in 2013, ''MSR on Wheels'' is a mobile unit able to provide simulation-based medical training to medical teams on=site, throughout Israel. ''MSR on Wheels'' makes MSR’s services and experience training clinical and communication skills and patient safety accessible to as broad a population as possible.

==Exams &amp; Assessment==
MSR specializes in developing simulation-based tests that expose an examinee's performance and ability to function and provide or oversee treatment in "real-life" situations. MSR also specializes in developing [[oral exam]]s and training healthcare professionals to evaluate examinees in oral exams. MSR’s partnership with the ''National Institute for Testing and Evaluation (NITE)'' enables professional consulting, analysis and research in simulation-based [[exam]]s.

MSR partners with the NITE in the following:

*Developing simulation-based examinations conducted at MSR - Board Exams are conducted at MSR for residents specializing in Anesthesiology, Adult and Pediatric [[Emergency Medicine]], and [[Radiotherapy]], in collaboration with their respective professional associations. MSR also conducts registration exams for all specialized nurses in Israel in collaboration with Israel's [[Ministry of Health]], [[Nursing]] Division, and the [[certification]] exam for paramedics, in partnership with [[Magen David Adom]].
*Consulting development teams for examinations that are not conducted at MSR -  Most of these are oral exams for Israeli medical associations. Exam development: choosing the exam structure, grading and decision-making systems, developing structured evaluation sheets, participating in writing the testing station scenarios, review of psychometric quality. MSR has assisted in developing and updating testing stations and evaluation sheets with the Israeli Associations of [[Surgery]], [[Orthopedics]] and [[Oncology]].
*Training the raters of the exams - training of the raters who conduct the screening exam for medical student candidates, and exams for nursing registration (over 2000 raters), certification of raters for oral exams for many of the medical associations (ENT, [[Emergency Medicine]], [[Orthopedics]], Surgery of the hand, etc.).

===Medical school candidates screening===
In collaboration with the National Institute for Testing and Evaluation (NITE), MSR provides simulation-based humanistic screening of [[medical school]] [[candidates]].

==International collaborations==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2359">'''Maggot farming''' is the act of growing [[maggot]]s for the industry. It is distinct from [[vermicompost]]ing as there is no separate composting process going on, and maggots are used which are distinct from [[earthworm]]s (they also consume only flesh, not plant-based material).

==Species used==
A variety of species can be used, including the [[black soldier fly]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entologics.com/production.html Entologics growing BSF maggots]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterrafeed.com/process/ Enterrafeed growing BSF maggots]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various other fly species. Due to convenience, fly species are often used which are indigenous to the area of cultivation.

==Method of cultivation==
When using indigenous fly species, one tactic (employed by the Songhai Center in Benin)&lt;ref&gt;The Blue Economy: 10 years – 100 innovations – 100 million jobs by Gunther Pauli&lt;/ref&gt; is to simply dump [[offal]] or [[Food waste#Animal feed|meat that has exceeded the sell-by date]] in concrete bins. The bins are then covered with [[chicken wire]] to prevent any large animals of being able to feed off it. Then, flies deposit eggs on the offal and meat, and maggots hatch and consume it. After that, the bins are filled with water, so the maggots start to float (separating themselves from any leftovers). The maggots are then harvested and the leftover is discarded or further processed (e.g., bones can be ground to bone meal, ...).

==Use of the maggots==
The maggots are often sold and used as animal feed. Especially [[Aquaculture|fish]], chickens, pig, ducks appreciate them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/3825158/farming-flies-south-africa/ Black soldier fly farms serving aquaculture and chicken farms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacksoldierflyfarming.com/faq/bsf-uses Black free soldier fly maggots used as animal feed]&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be sold as fishing bait.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4447">The '''Mahak Society to Support Children with Cancer''' is a non-governmental organisation in [[Tehran]] dedicated to helping Iranian children with cancer.  It runs an 18000 sq m hospital in the north of Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahak-charity.org Mahak Charity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inctr.org/publications/2004_v04_n04_s06.shtml INCTR: Newsletter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012010110/http://www.inctr.org/publications/2004_v04_n04_s06.shtml |date=2008-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:MAHAK Logo.jpg|right|Mahak Logo]]

== Foundation of MAHAK ==
The organisation was founded in 1991 by [[Saideh Ghods]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}  She had experienced having a child with cancer and had witnessed first hand the difficulties faced by her child, and pledged that she would set up a center that would act as a sanctuary for children and their families in a similar situation.  With the assistance of the same friends and relatives who had helped her through her own ordeal, a board of governors was selected and the “MAHAK Society to Support Children with Cancer” was set up as a non profit, non-governmental organization.  MAHAK has been active from that day in helping children with cancer and their families and has grown beyond anyone’s expectations.   MAHAK is funded entirely by donations and has supported 11,505 children over the past 17 years.

== MAHAK hospital and rehabilitation center ==

{{main|Mahak Hospital and Rehabilitation Complex}}

[[Image:Mahak hospital building.jpg|frame|The Mahak hospital]] In 2003, MAHAK’s Hospital and Rehabilitation center in [[Darabad, Tehran|Darabad]] was completed. The center is situated in Tehran’s north eastern hills and comprises an 18000 square meters building equipped to accommodate up to 120 children, each accompanied by a member of their family. The center houses diagnostic and treatment wards of the highest standards, on a par with those seen anywhere else.
Within the center, there are other facilities offered such as a clinic, a chemotherapy laboratory, radiotherapy section, physiotherapy ward, water therapy section, operation rooms, [[MRI]] and [[Computed tomography|CT Scan]], [[Radiology]], ICU, library, children's playroom, restaurant, amphitheater and a shopping center.
== Operation ==

The wards were equipped and began operation in August 2003, when the first patient was admitted.
The two rehabilitation wards are fully functional and are laid out over two floors, with 15 rooms on the first floor for children accompanied by a female member of their immediate family and with another 15 on the second floor for those children who need to be accompanied by a male family member.  There is also a playroom provided for the children, a sitting area for the families and a kitchenette.
Currently, these wards are run by 14 nursing graduates in three shifts around the clock. Two social workers offer their services in two shifts of morning and afternoon and two psychiatrists are available in the afternoon shifts.  In the afternoons a number of volunteers visit the ward to play with the children.
The Society’s team of social workers is fully active in children’s oncology wards in nine hospitals throughout Tehran, where they provide children and their parents with medical treatment and support.  
MAHAK pays all related expenses including X-rays, test, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, food, clothing and all accommodation during their treatment.  Since 60% of the children come to Tehran from the provinces, the Social Work Department arranges for their transfer by ambulance or plane.
MAHAK has been officially recognized by [[UNHCR]] as the organization which helps refugee children (Afghan and Iraqi) with cancer both in and out of refugee camps.

== Awards ==

In 2007, the organisation was presented with the Swiss SGS NGO Benchmarking award for the best and most transparent NGO in the Middle East.

Saideh Ghods received the 2008 IDB prize from the [[Islamic Development Bank]] for her work with Mahak&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidGN_02052008_10210049&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Masao Maruyama'''|丸山 眞男|Maruyama Masao|extra=1914 - 15 August 1996}} was a leading [[Japan]]ese political scientist and political theorist. His expertise lay in the history of Japanese political thought, to which he made major contributions.

==Biography==
Maruyama Masao was born in [[Osaka]] in 1914.&lt;ref name=jkirk&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Masao Maruyama|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-masao-maruyama-1311059.html|accessdate=8 September 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=23 August 1996|author=James Kirkup}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second son of journalist Maruyama Kanji. He was influenced by friends of his father such as [[Hasegawa Nyozekan]], a circle of people identified with the liberal current of political thought during the period of [[Taishō period|Taishō democracy]]. After graduating from Tokyo Furitsu Number One Middle School (currently known as Tokyo Municipal [[Hibiya High School]]), he entered the [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]] and graduated from the Department of Law in 1937. His thesis "The Concept of the Nation-state in Political Science" earned a Distinguished Thesis Award, and Maruyama was appointed assistant in the same department.

Originally he had wanted to specialize in European political thought, but changed his focus to concentrate on Japanese political thought, a subject that until that time,  mainly centered around the concept of an imperial state, and was influenced by a foundational ordinance that required subjects to be taught 'in accordance with the needs of the state'.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew E.Barshay, ''State and Intellectual in Imperial Japan:The Public Man in Crisis'', California University Press,,Berkeley, Los Angeles, London 1988 p.39&lt;/ref&gt;  Maruyama brought to the discipline a theoretical perspective grounded in extensive comparativism. The person who originally recommended this path to him was his mentor, Professor [[Nambara Shigeru]], who was highly critical of military and bureaucratic obstructions to the growth of a constitutionally defined 'national community'.&lt;ref&gt;Barshay, op. cit. pp. 104–108&lt;/ref&gt; An expert in European political thought, Nambara steered the young Maruyama into working on this topics.

In March 1945, Maruyama was drafted and stationed in the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Army]] at [[Hiroshima]]. After experiencing the blast at Hiroshima and seeing out the end of the war there, he returned to his post at the university in September. He caught [[tuberculosis]] at the time, and after an operation, spent the rest of his life on one lung.

Immediately following the war he published "The Logic and Psychology of [[Ultranationalism]]" and other theses dealing with prewar militarism and fascism which left a strong impact on postwar Japan. He was famous for calling the prewar imperial system a "system of irresponsibility". He was also a powerful democratic opinion leader, going far beyond the academic world and wielding great influence regarding the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] and the student movements of 1960.

However, in the late 1960s he was strongly denounced by the students front as a symbol of self-deceiving postwar democracy. He criticized this student movement, especially when his research room at University of Tokyo was ransacked by occupying students in 1969, an episode he characterised as an act of "barbarism not even [[Nazism|Nazis]] did".{{citation needed|date = September 2008}} This, combined with his own ailing health, forced him to retire in 1971. He was however appointed [[professor emeritus]] at the same university in 1974.

Though Maruyama suffered from poor health especially in his later life, he continued studying and writing until he died in Tokyo on 15 August 1996.&lt;ref name=jkirk/&gt; The major work of his retirement years was a three-volume commentary on [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]]'s Fukuzawa's principal work ''Bunmeiron no Gairyaku'', based on a lengthy seminar he conducted with a small working group. This was published in 1986, as ''Reading 'An Outline of a Theory of Civilisation',''(「文明論之概略」を読む) by Iwanami Shoten. Besides, he contributed several more noteworthy as well as controversial works on Japanese culture or the process of translation in modern Japan. Most noteworthy is his concept of [[Ostinato|basso ostinato]]. Maruyama referred to this musicological concept to capture a socio-historically substratum underlying human thought. Although basso ostinato is in constant flux, it is experienced by people as a relatively stable  intellectual framework through which people give meaning to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rösch|first=Felix|last2=Watanabe|first2=Atsuko|date=2016-07-13|title=Approaching the unsynthesizable in international politics: Giving substance to security discourses through basso ostinato?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1354066116656764|journal=European Journal of International Relations|language=en|pages=1354066116656764|doi=10.1177/1354066116656764|issn=1354-0661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical education in the United States''' includes educational activities involved in the education and training of [[physicians]] in the [[United States]], from entry-level training through to continuing education of qualified specialists. 

A typical outline of the [[medical education]] pathway is presented below; however, [[medicine]] is a diverse [[profession]] with many options available. For example, some physicians work in [[pharmaceutical]] [[research]], [[occupational medicine]] (within a company), [[public health]] medicine (working for the general health of a population in an area), or join the [[armed forces]].

==Medical school==
{{Main|Medical school in the United States}}

In the United States a [[medical school]] is an institution with the purpose of educating [[physicians in the United States]] in the field of medicine.  Admission into medical school may not technically require completion of a previous degree; however, applicants are usually required to complete at least 3 years of "[[Pre-medical|pre-med]]" courses at the university level because in the US medical degrees are classified as [[Second entry degree]]s.  Once enrolled in a medical school the four years progressive study is divided into two roughly equal components: pre-clinical (consisting of didactic courses in the basic sciences) and clinical ([[clerkship (medicine)|clerkships]] consisting of rotations through different wards of a [[teaching hospital]]).  The degree granted at the conclusion of these four years of study is [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) or, less commonly, [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (D.O.) depending on the medical school; both degrees allow the holder to practice medicine after completing an accredited residency program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002020.htm |title=Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine |author=Medline Plus |year=2012 |work= |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine of National Institutes of Health |accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001936.htm |title=Doctor of medicine profession (MD) |author=Medline Plus |year=2012 |work= |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine of National Institutes of Health |accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
{{further|Comparison of MD and DO in the United States}}

==Internship==
{{Main|Internship (medicine)}}

During the last year of graduate medical education, students apply for postgraduate ''residencies'' in their chosen field of [[specialty (medicine)|specialization]]. These vary in competitiveness depending upon the desirability of the specialty, prestige of the program, and the number of applicants relative to the number of available positions.  All but a few positions are granted via a national computer match which pairs an applicant's preference with the programs' preference for applicants. 

Historically, post-graduate medical education began with a free-standing, one-year internship. Completion of this year continues to be the minimum training requirement for obtaining a general license to practice medicine in most states. However, because of the gradual lengthening of post-graduate medical education, and the decline of its use as the terminal stage in training, most new physicians complete the internship requirement as their first year of residency.

Not withstanding the trend toward internships integrated into categorical residencies, the one-year "traditional rotating internship" (sometimes called a "transitional year") continues to exist.  Some residency training programs, such as in [[neurology]] and [[ophthalmology]], do not include an internship year and begin after completion of an internship or transitional year.  Some use it to re-apply to programs into which they were not accepted, while others use it as a year to decide upon a specialty. In addition, [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic physicians]] "are required to have completed an [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA)-approved first year of training in order to be licensed in Florida, Michigan, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania."&lt;ref&gt;DO-Online.org | Postdoctoral Training  | FAQS, ''[http://www.do-online.org/index.cfm?PageID=edu_main&amp;au=D&amp;SubPageID=sir_postdoc&amp;SubSubPageID=sir_faqmain#faq3]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residency==
{{Main|Residency (medicine)}}

Each of the specialties in medicine has established its own curriculum, which defines the length and content of residency training necessary to practice in that specialty.  Programs range from 3 years after medical school for internal medicine and pediatrics, to 5 years for general surgery, to 7 years for neurosurgery.   Each specialty training program either incorporates an internship year to satisfy the requirements of state licensure, or stipulates that an internship year be completed ''before'' starting the program at the second post-graduate year (PGY-2).

==Fellowship==
{{Main|Fellowship (medicine)}}

A fellowship is a formal, full-time training program that focuses on a particular area within the specialty, with requirements beyond the related residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Osteopathic Postdoctoral Training Structure|url=https://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/accreditation/postdoctoral-training-approval/Documents/osteopathic-postdoctoral-training-structure.pdf|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many highly specialized fields require formal training beyond residency.  Examples of these include [[cardiology]], [[endocrinology]], [[oncology]] after [[internal medicine]]; [[cardiothoracic anesthesiology]] after [[anesthesiology]]; [[cardiothoracic surgery]], [[pediatric surgery]], [[surgical oncology]] after [[general surgery]]; [[Reproductive endocrinology and infertility|reproductive endocrinology/infertility]], [[maternal-fetal medicine]], [[gynecologic oncology]] after obstetrics/gynecology. There are many others for each field of study. In some specialties such as pathology and radiology, a majority of graduating residents go on to further their training. The training programs for these fields are known as ''fellowships'' and their participants are ''fellows'', to denote that they already have completed a residency and are board eligible or board certified in their basic specialty. Fellowships range in length from one to three years and are granted by application to the individual program or [[subspecialty|sub-specialty]] organizing board. Fellowships often contain a research component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Medical Specialties Matching Program|url=http://www.nrmp.org/fellow/match_name/msmp/about.html|publisher=National Resident Matching Program|year=2010|accessdate=20 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209123908/http://www.nrmp.org/fellow/match_name/msmp/about.html|archivedate=9 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board certification==
{{Main|Board certification}}

The physician or surgeon who has completed his or her residency and possibly fellowship training and is in the practice of his or her specialty is known as an [[attending physician]].  Physicians then must pass written and oral exams in their specialty in order to become board certified.  Each of the 26 medical specialties has different requirements for practitioners to undertake [[continuing medical education]] activities.

A '''minority group''' refers to a [[Categorization|category]] of people who experience relative disadvantage as compared to members of a dominant social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1006532841|title=Race, ethnicity, gender, &amp; class : the sociology of group conflict and change|last=1945-|first=Healey, Joseph F.,|others=Stepnick, Andi,, O'Brien, Eileen, 1972-|isbn=9781506346946|edition= Eighth |location=Thousand Oaks, California|oclc=1006532841|date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minority group membership is typically based on differences in observable characteristics or practices, such as: [[sex]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[religion]], [[disability]], [[sexual orientation]], or [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/871004576|title=Essentials of sociology|last=George,|first=Ritzer,|isbn=9781483340173|location=Los Angeles|oclc=871004576|date=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing the framework of [[intersectionality]], it is important to recognize that an individual may simultaneously hold membership in multiple minority groups (e.g. both a racial and religious minority).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Laurie|first1=Timothy|title=The Concept of Minority for the Study of Culture|url=https://www.academia.edu/31725889|journal=Continuum: Journal for Media and Cultural Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=3|year=2017|last2=Khan|first2=Rimi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, individuals may also be part of a minority group in regard to some characteristics, but part of a dominant group in regard to others.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The term "minority group" often occurs within the [[discourse]] of [[civil rights]] and [[collective rights]], as members of minority groups are prone to differential treatment in the countries and societies in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/louilr63&amp;div=34&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=The Struggle for Civil Rights: The Need for, and Impediments to, Political Coalitions among and within Minority Groups|last=Johnson|first=Kevin|date=|website=heinonline.org|publisher=Louisiana Law Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minority group members often face [[discrimination]] in multiple areas of social life, including housing, employment, healthcare, and education, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/658199810|title=The economics of discrimination|last=1930-2014.|first=Becker, Gary S.

[[Louis Wirth]] defined a minority group as "a group of people who, because of their physical or cultural characteristics, are singled out from the others in the [[society]] in which they live for differential and unequal treatment, and who therefore regard themselves as objects of collective discrimination".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Science of Man in the World Crisis|last=Wirth|first=L.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1945|editor-last=Linton|editor-first=Ralph|location=New York|page=347|chapter=The Problem of Minority Groups}} The political scientist and law professor, Gad Barzilai, has offered a theoretical definition of non-ruling communities that conceptualizes groups that do not rule and are excluded from resources of political power. Barzilai, G. ''Communities and Law: Politics and Cultures of Legal Identities.'' Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition includes both objective and subjective criteria: membership of a minority group is objectively [[Ascribed status|ascribed]] by society, based on an individual's physical or behavioral characteristics; it is also subjectively applied by its members, who may use their status as the basis of group identity or [[Social solidarity|solidarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/12323228|title=Minorities in the new world : six case studies|last=Wagley|first=Charles|last2=Harris|first2=Marvin|date=1958|publisher=New York : Columbia University Press|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, minority group status is categorical in nature: an individual who exhibits the physical or behavioral characteristics of a given minority group is accorded the status of that group and is subject to the same treatment as other members of that group.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Joe Feagin]], states that a minority group has five characteristics: (1) suffering discrimination and subordination, (2) physical and/or cultural traits that set them apart, and which are disapproved by the dominant group, (3) a shared sense of collective identity and common burdens, (4) socially shared rules about who belongs and who does not determine minority status, and (5) tendency to marry within the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Racial and Ethnic Relations|last=|author=Joe R. Feagin|first=|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1984|isbn=978-0-13-750125-0|edition= 2nd|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms====
There is a controversy with the use of the word minority, as it has a common and an academic usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Diversity Glossary of Terms|last=Diversity Training University International|publisher=Diversity Training University International Publications Division|year=2008|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common usage of the term indicates a statistical minority; however, academics refer to power differences among groups rather than differences in population size among groups.&lt;ref name="Barzilai 20102"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1sHzZbXdjggC|title=Communities and Law: Politics and Cultures of Legal Identities|last=Barzilai|first=Gad|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sociologists have criticised the concept of "minority/majority", arguing this language excludes or neglects changing or unstable cultural identities, as well as cultural affiliations across national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Laurie|first1=Timothy|title=The Concept of Minority for the Study of Culture|url=https://www.academia.edu/31725889|journal=Continuum: Journal for Media and Cultural Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=1–12|year=2017|last2=Khan|first2=Rimi}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the term historically excluded groups (HEGs) is often similarly used to highlight the role of historical oppression and domination, and how this results in the underrepresentation of particular groups in various areas of social life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Konrad|first=Alison M.|date=1999|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/handbook-of-gender-and-work/n22.xml|work=Handbook of Gender &amp; Work|pages=429–452|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781452231365.n22|access-date=2018-08-15|last2=Linnehan|first2=Frank|title=Handbook of Gender &amp; Work Handbook of gender &amp; work|isbn=9780761913559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political ===
The term national minority is often used to discuss minority groups in international and national politics.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Daniel Šmihula|year=2008|title=National Minorities in the Law of the EC/EU|url=http://ns.ier.ro/site/documente/rjea_pdf/RJEA_Vol8_No3_Sept2008.pdf|deadurl=yes|journal=Romanian Journal of European Affairs|volume=8|pages=51–81|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823110657/http://ns.ier.ro/site/documente/rjea_pdf/RJEA_Vol8_No3_Sept2008.pdf|archivedate=2011-08-23|number=3|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All countries contain some degree of racial, ethnic, or linguistic diversity.[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/18/the-most-and-least-culturally-diverse-countries-in-the-world/] In addition, minorities may also be minorities they may be migrant, indigenous or landless nomadic communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/754152959|title=The representation of minorities and indigenous peoples in parliament : a global overview|last=Oleh.|first=Protsyk,|date=2010|publisher=Inter-parliamentary Union|others=Inter-parliamentary Union.|isbn=9789291424627|location=Geneva|oclc=754152959}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often results in variations in language, culture, beliefs, practices, that set some groups apart from the dominant grop. As these differences are usually perceived negatively by, this results in loss of social and political power for members of minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verkuyten|first=Maykel|date=2005|title=Ethnic Group Identification and Group Evaluation Among Minority and Majority Groups: Testing the Multiculturalism Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=88|issue=1|pages=121–138|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.88.1.121|pmid=15631579|issn=1939-1315|citeseerx=10.1.1.595.7633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no legal definition of national minorities in international law, though protection of minority groups is outlined by the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities]]. [[International criminal law]] can protect the rights of racial or ethnic minorities in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyal Sunga|Lyal S. Sunga]] (2004). ''International Criminal Law: Protection of Minority Rights, Beyond a One-Dimensional State: An Emerging Right to Autonomy?'' ed. Zelim Skurbaty. (2004) 255–275.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to [[self-determination]] is a key issue.

The formal level of protection of national minorities is highest in European countries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Council of Europe proposes a definition of national minorities in the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] and by the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]]; however these definitions are not binding upon member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/minorities/fcnm-factsheet|title=Factsheet on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities|website=National Minorities (FCNM)|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this framework, a national minority can be theoretically defined as a group of people within a given nation state:

#which is numerically smaller than the rest of population of the state or a part of the state,
#which is not in a dominant position,
#which has culture, language, religion, race etc. distinct from that of the majority of the population,
#whose members have a will to preserve their group identity,
#whose members are citizens of the state where they have the status of a minority, and
#whose members have had long-term presence in the territory.

In some places, subordinate [[ethnic group]]s may constitute a numerical majority, such as Blacks in South Africa under [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=du Toit|first=Pierre|last2=Theron|first2=François|date=1988|title=Ethnic and minority groups, and constitutional change in South Africa|journal=Journal of Contemporary African Studies|language=en|volume=7|issue=1–2|pages=133–147|doi=10.1080/02589008808729481|issn=0258-9001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], for example, non-Hispanic Whites constitute the majority (63.4%) and all other racial and ethnic groups (Hispanic or [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]], [[African Americans]], [[Asian Americans]], [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]], and [[Native Hawaiians]]) are classified as "minorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045217|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: UNITED STATES|website=Census Bureau QuickFacts|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the non-Hispanic White population falls below 50% the group will only be the ''plurality'', not the majority.

== Examples of minority groups ==
===Age minorities===
The elderly, while traditionally influential or even (in a [[gerontocracy]]) dominant in the past, are now usually reduced to the minority role of economically 'non-active' groups.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Children can also be understood as a minority group in these terms, and the discrimination faced by the young is known as [[adultism]]. Discrimination against the elderly is known as [[ageism]].

Various local and [[International human rights instruments|international statutes]] are in place to mitigate the exploitation of children, such as the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], as well as a number of organizations that make up the [[children's rights movement]]. The [[youth rights]] movement campaigns for social empowerment for young people, and against the legal and social restrictions placed on [[Minor (law)|legal minors]]. Groups that advocate the interests of [[Senior citizen|senior citizens]] range from the charitable ([[Help the Aged]]) to grass-roots activism ([[Gray Panthers]]), and often overlap with disability rights issues.

=== Educational minorities ===

=== Involuntary minorities ===
Also known as "castelike minorities," involuntary minorities are a term for people who were originally brought into any society against their will. In the United States, for instance, it includes but is not limited to Native Americans, Puerto Ricans, African Americans,&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adams.edu/administration/hr/search-procedures/understanding-cultural-diversity-and-learning.pdf|title=Understanding Cultural Diversity and Learning|last=Ogbu|first=John U.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and native-born Mexican Americans.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogbu and Simons|first=|date=1998|title=Voluntary and Involuntary Minorities: A Cultural-Ecological Theory of School Performance with Some Implications for Education|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/rsoder/EDUC305/OgbuSimonsvoluntaryinvoluntary.pdf|journal=Anthropology and Education Quarterly|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons of cultural differences, involuntary minorities may experience difficulties in school more than members of other (voluntary) minority groups. Social capital helps children engage with different age groups that share a common goal.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Subtractive Schooling|last=Valenzuela|first=Angela|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary minorities===
Immigrants take on minority status in their new country, usually in hopes of a better future economically, educationally, and politically than in their homeland. Because of their focus on success, voluntary minorities are more likely to do better in school than other migrating minorities.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Adapting to a very different culture and language make difficulties in the early stages of life in the new country. Voluntary immigrants do not experience a sense of divided identity as much as involuntary minorities, and are often rich in social capital because of their educational ambitions.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Major immigrant groups in the United States include Mexicans, Central and South Americans, Cubans, Africans, and Indians.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Gender and sexuality minorities ===
{{main|Sexual minority}}The term sexual minority is frequently used by public health researchers to recognize a wide variety of individuals who engage in same-sex sexual behavior, including those who do not identify under the LGBTQ umbrella. For example, men who have sex with men (MSM), but do not identify as gay. In addition, the term gender minorities can include many types of [[Gender variance|gender variant]] people, such as [[intersex]] people, [[Transsexuality|transgender people]], or gender non-conforming individuals. However, the terms sexual and gender minority are often not preferred by LGBTQ people, as they represent clinical categories rather than individual identity.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Kenneth H.|last2=Bradford|first2=Judith B.|last3=Makadon|first3=Harvey J.|last4=Stall|first4=Ron|last5=Goldhammer|first5=Hilary|last6=Landers|first6=Stewart|date=2008|title=Sexual and Gender Minority Health: What We Know and What Needs to Be Done|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=98|issue=6|pages=989–995|doi=10.2105/ajph.2007.127811|issn=0090-0036|pmc=2377288|pmid=18445789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]], and [[queer]] (LGBTQ) people have existed throughout human history, LGBT rights movements across many western countries led to the recognition of LGBTQ people as members of a minority group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Kenneth H.|last2=Bradford|first2=Judith B.|last3=Makadon|first3=Harvey J.|last4=Stall|first4=Ron|last5=Goldhammer|first5=Hilary|last6=Landers|first6=Stewart|date=2008|title=Sexual and Gender Minority Health: What We Know and What Needs to Be Done|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=98|issue=6|pages=989–995|doi=10.2105/ajph.2007.127811|issn=0090-0036|pmc=2377288|pmid=18445789}}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBTQ people represent a numerical and social minority. They experience numerous social inequalities stemming from their group membership as LGBTQ people. These inequalities include social discrimination and isolation, unequal access to healthcare, employment, and housing, and experience negative mental and physical health outcomes due to these experiences.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===People with disabilities===
The [[disability rights movement]] has contributed to an understanding of people with disabilities (including not to be called 'disabled') as a minority or a coalition of minorities who are disadvantaged by society, not just as people who are disadvantaged by their impairments. Advocates of disability rights emphasize difference in physical or psychological functioning, rather than inferiority. For example, some people with [[autism]] argue for acceptance of [[neurodiversity]], much as opponents of [[racism]] argue for acceptance of ethnic diversity. The [[deaf community]] is often regarded as a linguistic and cultural minority rather than a group with disabilities, and some [[deaf]] people do not see themselves as having a disability at all. Rather, they are disadvantaged by technologies and social institutions that are designed to cater for the dominant group. (''See the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]''.)[[File:Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg_NYWTS.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg_NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Photo of the Rosenbergs in jail]]

===Political minorities===
One of the most controversial minorities in the [[United States]] and other countries has been communists. Along with the [[Red Scare]] and execution of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]], the United States ran open campaigns to fight, contain and promote fear of communism in the country. Some were persecuted as communist even when they were not actually so: for example, many activists for civil rights were portrayed as inspired by a communist agenda. Communists in the United States, as in many European countries, are often afraid to proclaim their politics, fearing abuse and discrimination from the political majority.

===Religious minorities===
{{main|Religious minorities}}People belonging to religious minorities have a faith which is different from that held by the majority. Most countries of the world have religious minorities. It is now widely accepted in the west that people should have the freedom to choose their own religion, including not having any religion ([[atheism]] and/or [[agnosticism]]), and including the right to convert from one religion to another. However, in many countries this freedom is constricted. For example, in [[Egypt]], a new system of identity cards&lt;ref&gt;See "The Situation of the Bahá'í Community of Egypt" and "Religion Today: Bahais' struggle for recognition reveals a less tolerant face of Egypt", [http://www.bahai.org/persecution/egypt/update Bahai.org],  [http://dwb.sacbee.com/24hour/religion/story/3315375p-12212722c.html DWB.sacbee.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014053747/http://dwb.sacbee.com/24hour/religion/story/3315375p-12212722c.html|date=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires all citizens to state their religion—and the only choices are [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], or [[Judaism]] (See [[Egyptian identification card controversy]]).

=== Regional minorities ===
Authors have pointed out that many coal workers would be unwilling to move for work or were not likely to be able to be retrained as Appalachians are an "ethnic minority".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jun/14/americas-other-minority/|title=OPINION: America's other minority?|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|date=June 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women as minorities ===
While in most societies, numbers of men and women are roughly equal, the status of women as a subordinate group has led to many social scientists to study them as a minority group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hacker|first=Helen Mayer|year=1951|title=Women as a Minority Group|journal=[[Social Forces]]|volume=30|issue=1|pages=60–69|doi=10.2307/2571742|jstor=2571742}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though women's legal rights and status vary widely across countries, women experience social inequalities relative to men in most societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56216656|title=Multicultural jurisdictions : cultural differences and women's rights|last=1966-|first=Shachar, Ayelet,|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=978-0511040801|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=|oclc=56216656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are often denied access to education, subject to violence, and lack access to the same economic opportunities as men.&lt;ref&gt;Women, U. N. (2018). Annual Report 2017–2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and government==
In the politics of some countries, a "minority" is an [[ethnic group]] recognized by law, and having specified rights. Speakers of a legally recognized [[minority language]], for instance, might have the right to education or communication with the government in their mother tongue. Countries with special provisions{{which|date=May 2016}} for minorities include [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Germany]], [[India]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Croatia]], and the [[United Kingdom]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The various minority groups in a country are often not given equal treatment. Some groups are too small or indistinct to obtain minority protections. For example, a member of a particularly small ethnic group might be forced to check "Other" on a checklist of different backgrounds and so might receive fewer privileges than a member of a more defined group.

Many contemporary governments prefer to assume the people they rule all belong to the same nationality rather than separate ones based on ethnicity. The United States asks for [[race (U.S. Census)|race and ethnicity]] on its official census forms, which thus breaks up and organizes its population into sub-groups, primarily racial rather than national. [[Spain]] does not divide its nationals by ethnic group, although it does maintain an official notion of minority languages.

Some especially significant or powerful minorities receive comprehensive protection and political representation. For example, the former Yugoslav republic of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] recognizes the three constitutive nations, none of which constitutes a numerical majority (see [[nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]). However, other minorities such as [[Romani people|Romani]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00421|title=Political recognition of Roma People in Spain. [Social Impact]. WORKALÓ. The creation of new occupational patterns for cultural minorities: the Gypsy Case (2001-2004). Framework Programme 5 (FP5)|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR, Social Impact Open Repository|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jews]], are officially labelled "foreign" and are excluded from many of these protections. For example, they may be excluded from political positions, including the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/minorities/2._framework_convention_(monitoring)/2._monitoring_mechanism/4._opinions_of_the_advisory_committee/1._country_specific_opinions/1._first_cycle/PDF_1st_OP_BiH.pdf Opinion of the Council of Europe's Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, in particular paragraphs 37–43] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616100431/http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/minorities/2._framework_convention_(monitoring)/2._monitoring_mechanism/4._opinions_of_the_advisory_committee/1._country_specific_opinions/1._first_cycle/PDF_1st_OP_BiH.pdf |date=2007-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate over recognizing minority groups and their privileges. One view&lt;ref&gt;For example, J.A. Lindgren-Alves, member of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, speaking at the Committee's 67th Session (Summary Record of the 1724th Meeting, 23 August 2005, CERD/C/SR.1724)&lt;/ref&gt; is that the application of special rights to minority groups may harm some countries, such as new states in Africa or Latin America not founded on the European [[nation-state]] model, since minority recognition may interfere with establishing a national identity. It may hamper the integration of the minority into mainstream society, perhaps leading to [[separatism]] or [[supremacist|supremacism]]. In [[Canada]], some{{who|date=January 2012}} feel that the failure of the dominant [[English language|English]]-speaking majority to integrate [[French Canadians]] has provoked [[Quebec separatism]].

Others assert that minorities require specific protections to ensure that they are not marginalised: for example, [[bilingual education]] may be needed to allow linguistic minorities to fully integrate into the school system and compete equally in society. In this view, rights for minorities strengthen the nation-building project, as members of minorities see their interests well served, and willingly accept the legitimacy of the nation and their integration (not assimilation) within it.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |first=K. |last=Henrard |title=Devising an Adequate System of Minority Protection: Individual Human Rights, Minority Rights and the Right to Self-Determination |location= |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=2000 |pages=218–224 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFF5nzuAze0C&amp;pg=PA218 |isbn=978-9041113597 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17299">A '''mobile hospital''' is a medical center or a small [[hospital]] with full medical equipment that can be moved and settled in a new place and situation swiftly. So it can provide medical services to patients or wounded persons in critical conditions such as war or [[natural disaster]]s.
[[File:Mobile hospital00.jpg|thumb|370x370px|the ambit of a mobile hospital]]
In fact, a mobile hospital is a [[Modularity|modular]] unit that every part of it is on the wheel, so it can be moved to another place easily, although all the required space and necessary equipment are considered so it can be utilized in the minimum time.

With mobile hospital, one can provide medical services to wounded soldiers or patients near the war zone or any other place before moving them to the permanent hospital.
In the mobile hospital, depending on the patient's situation and definitive treatment, admitted to the hospital and after evaluating the condition sent to another health center.

During hundreds of years, the armies need to save soldiers’ lives and rescue wounded has led to the development of military medicine

In fact, war always directly or indirectly has caused development in [[Medicine|medical Science]]. In this case, mobile hospitals and field hospitals are developed to help them to present fast and desirable services in the battlefields.

Nowadays mobile hospital serves as a more comprehensive and wider type of the [[Mobile army surgical hospital (US)|Mash]], and more modern and up-to-date than the field Hospital to save human being's life and improve medical processes in natural disasters and war.

Since mobile hospital provides most of the medical equipment and required medical areas on the wheels through the roads, it needs a special platform.

Base platform of a mobile hospital can be a rear box of a truck or the box of a [[semi-trailer]].

Since mobile hospitals have similar therapeutic protocols with permanent hospitals, the rules and Criteria are the same too. Therefore, mobile hospital platform must be so flexible and efficient to design a health center similar to a permanent one.

Regarding Variety of medical services or capacity of hospitalization part, mobile hospital and [[field hospital]]s are similar to each other

In particular, a mobile hospital is bigger than first aid units and smaller than a permanent hospital. Also, the mobile hospital can be connected to another field hospital, for increasing ward sections capacity every time everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Nosratkhah, Keivan, Vice President of SabaPalaye Co.(Designer and producer of mobile hospitals)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the international laws of human rights, including [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]] based on the ban on strike to doctors, ambulance, and hospitals which Marked with [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross or Red Crescent]] sign, Mobile hospitals will have Immunity on any strike too.

== Mobile hospitals or field hospitals ==
The primary platform of the mobile hospitals is on semi-trailers, trucks, buses or ambulances which all of them can move on the roads.
However, the main structure of a field hospital is tent and container. Tents and all necessary medical equipment will be placed in containers and finally transport via airplane, train, ship, truck or trailer.

Therefore, the mobile hospital is a movable unit itself, but a field hospital is a transportable unit.

The body materials of the mobile hospital are thermal insulation layer with a sheet of steel or fiberglass, but the tent of the field hospital is a fabric and tarpaulin.

Hygienic Decontamination and compliance with health protocols in mobile hospitals better than field hospitals can be observed and also heat and cooling systems will be more efficient than field hospital.

== Platform and structure of mobile hospital ==
In advanced mobile hospitals, special  trailers with more efficient medical space are used, so some of these special trailers are expendable.

Expandable trailers are similar to other standard semi-trailers while they are moving on the roads but as they stop or during the use, the semi-trailer (or truck) boxes will expand. For example, the total area of a semi-trailer with four expandable boxes can reach over 80 square meters if a standard size of a  trailer is only 35 in usual.

== Structure of various parts of the mobile hospital ==
Structure of different parts of the mobile hospital can be different According to its purpose.

Generally, several types of platforms are used in the construction of mobile hospitals; therefore different parts of mobile hospital, from the viewpoint of platform framework, can be placed in three following categories:
* Corridor trailers
[[File:Expandable trailer, corridor trailer, utility trailer.jpg|thumb|368x368px|Several kinds of trailer widely used in mobile hospitals]]
* Utility trailers
* Medical trailers

=== Corridor trailers structure ===
In the mobile hospital, connectable halls or corridors can be standard size trailers or a normal container. These trailers have several doors to connect to other units or corridors via a special connector.

The special connector can be a tent, inflatable structure, or open gangway connection.

For efficient use of space; technical rooms, receptionist desk, cabinets, and closets can be installed.

=== Utility trailers (service units, offices, welfare sections and accessories and necessary utilities) ===
Each hospital, apart from the medical departments, needs electrical and mechanical facilities, repair and maintenance units, safety and health section, administrative offices, communication servicing, equipment management, toilets, bathrooms, laundries, kitchens, food supply and distribution, staff and doctors dormitories, production, and distribution. Electrical energy, water purification and storage units, warehouses, merge command rooms, and other services

This equipment or spaces mostly takes place in a standard truck rear boxes or semi-trailers regular size boxes.

=== Medical trailers ===
Most Medical sections of mobile hospital are placed on special trailers Medical special trailers are semi-trailer boxes with expanding ability.

== Division of space and various departments of the mobile hospital==
The mobile hospital includes different sections of a permanent hospital. So all or some of the following departments can be a part of a mobile hospital.
* [[Emergency department|Accident and emergency (A&amp;E)]]
*[[Triage]] 
* [[Trauma center|Trauma]]
* [[Decontamination]] 
* Ward section 
* [[Medical imaging|Medical Imaging department (X-Ray, Ultra Sound, CT scan, MRI)]]

== Requirements and arrangements ==
# The mobile hospital should be settled in a  familiar, easily accessible place. It is recommended that the hospital is placed next to a relatively tall or well-known landmark (such as a school or shopping mall, etc.) So patients and locals may locate it without much trouble.
# The mobile hospital should be deployed locally to reach the appropriate road
# The mobile hospital's ambit should be large sufficient to provide the necessary space for the movement and rotation of the trucks and trailers.
# The mobile hospital's ambit should be enclosed with walls, fences or any other suitable coverings.
# The mobile hospital’s scope should have a sufficient number of magnified flags of [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|RED CRESCENT and the RED CROSS]] sign so that they can be discovered from the surrounding hills, ground or the air with relative ease.
# The mobile hospital's ambit should contain at least two standard [[Helipad]]s.
# The  mobile  Hospital's area must have accessibility to the drinkable water, food, medicine &amp; medical equipment and fuel supplies as well as drinking water tanks in its ambit must be considered; along with food and medicine storage, medical equipment storage and fuel tank and  waste water tank (or  dry well) 
# After settling the mobile hospital, medical tents might be considered in blank spaces between structures, (and tents heating and cooling systems) in these free areas.  In emergencies, these tents can be used for increasing ward section capacity.
# Inside the mobile hospital area; trailer trucks, cars, and ambulances should be identified, so these areas will always be available and clear.
# Before settling the mobile hospital, final location of trailers must be marked and linearized with a Surveying camera and a specified map 
# Necessary arrangements should be made for lighting inside and outside of the mobile hospital on day or night.
# Parking areas should be considered for an enough number of ambulances. 
# Security system, doorman, guards and road blocks should be considered for hospital discipline.

== History of Mobile hospital ==
To discuss the history of the mobile hospital, we must first take a look at the history of Mash and field hospital; since the mobile hospital is the advanced and generalized form of Mash and more efficient and operational form of the field hospital.

=== Field hospital ===
{{main article|Field hospital}}

The surgical, evacuation or field hospitals would remain many miles in the rear, and the divisional clearing stations were never intended to provide emergency life-saving surgery. With the Army’s larger medical units unable to assume their traditional role in support of the front line combat units, the chain of evacuation was interrupted at a critical point. Some interim solution had to be found quickly to provide the necessary surgical services and care to the severely wounded directly behind the front lines. Otherwise, many wounded soldiers would die from either the lack of life-saving surgery at the front or from the long and arduous evacuation trek along jungle trails from the frontal clearing stations to the nearest surgical unit, Manned with skilled surgeons and located close to the fighting to render quick, life-saving surgical intervention, the portable hospital could be moved by its own personnel to remain with the infantrymen during fluid operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-09-24|title=Field hospital|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_hospital&amp;oldid=802138700|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MASH units ===
{{See also|Mobile army surgical hospital (US)}}

The concept of [[Mobile army surgical hospital (US)|Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]] or [[Mobile army surgical hospital (US)|MASH]] was invented by United States army. It is by definition a fully functional hospital used on the battlefield. It first came into being in August 1945; later it was used in the [[Korean War]] and many following conflicts.

The idea of a mobile medical unit originated from the dental field by Major Vincent P. Marran, a medic during [[World War II|WWII]]. His achievements were highly appreciated, but it was never formally labeled. Also, Harry A. Ferguson, the [[executive officer]] of the Tokyo Army Hospital, had a big part in the development of MASH.

Korean War had a big part in defining of MASH since the rising number of battle-injured demanded a more efficient medical care than traditional army doctors or transportation to a permanent hospital. MASH was that solution. It was established near front not only to supply more flexible military medical care and offer better care but also to serve as other purposes such as blood storage and distribution.

A MASH unit was supposed to provide mostly surgical services for injured on the battlefield, but this definition was abandoned under the pressure of war-time needs.  Early plans were a truck-based, portable, 60-bed facility deployed deep into the battlefield just out of enemy [[artillery]] range; to provide primary care for injured until they can be transported to back line to a permanent hospital.

In [[Korean War]], without a proper means of transportation, as a result of the expansion of required services of MASHs without a possibility of more personnel, rapid evacuation of patients were essentialized. There are some reports of Korean War that in some cases, a MASH hospital took care of a number of patients two times its capacity, each day. In late 1951, MASHs were being deployed much closer to battles, usually in 30 kilometers of front line. Still, in relative safety, MASHs were able to operate more efficiently with wounded receiving medical care sooner than ever.

According to military standards, acceptable time for assembly of a MASH unit from arrival to becoming operational is 4 hours. For disassembly, getting loaded into vehicles and ready to depart, this time is 6 hours.

Early MASHs could perform five surgeries a shift and had an efficient system to [[Triage|prioritize wounded]]. Each MASH unit was accompanied by a platoon of ambulances to ease the quick evacuation of treated patients and a group of helicopters to resupply the unit and speed up patient delivery to it as air ambulances.

This system turned out to be super effective. The fatality rate for US army wounded dropped from 4.5 percent in WWII to only 2.5 percent in Korea.

MASH proved its worth in Korea and became a key part of armies afterward. Technological and medical progress have helped MASH to save many lives not only in battlefields but also during unpredicted incidents and less developed regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jatoi|first=Ismail|date=May 2005|title=The Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH): A Military and Surgical Legacy|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2569328/pdf/jnma00186-0014.pdf|journal=Journal of the National Medical Association|volume=97|pages=650–651|via=|pmc=2569328|pmid=15926641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summary ===
* [[Mobile army surgical hospital (US)|MASH]] provides only basic surgical and lifesaving treatments to sustain the patient until transportation to a permanent hospital. Field hospital lacks the needed efficiency in harsh conditions such as abnormal rain, heat, cold, and bio-hazard environment as a result of structure and material used, and disability in proper air-conditioning and decontamination; And it takes a considerable amount of time to deploy and tents tend to be very difficult to set up in mentioned conditions.

To solve the mentioned issues and by combining the idea of the field hospital and platforms and structures of MASH, the mobile hospital was born.

'''Pastoralism''' is the branch of [[agriculture]] concerned with the raising of [[livestock]]. It is [[animal husbandry]]: the care, tending and use of animals such as [[cattle]], [[camel]]s, [[goat]]s, [[yak]]s, [[llama]]s, [[reindeer]]s, [[horse]]s and [[sheep]]. 

"Pastoralism" generally has a mobile aspect; moving the herds in search of fresh [[pasture]] and water (in contrast to [[pastoral farming]], in which non-nomadic farmers grow crops and improve pastures for their livestock). Pastoralism is similar to nomadic movement because all of them go to places season to productive land, and adapts well to the environment. For example, in [[savannas]], pastoralists and their animals gather when rainwater is abundant and the pasture is rich, then scatter during the drying of the savanna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Emilio F.|title=People and Nature: An Introduction to Human Ecological Relations|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-4051-0572-9|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastoralists often use their herds to affect their environment. Grazing herds on savannas can ensure the biodiversity of the savannas and prevent them from evolving into [[scrubland]]. Pastoralists may also use fire to make ecosystems more suitable for their food animals. For instance, the [[Turkana people]] of northwest [[Kenya]] use fire to prevent the invasion of the savanna by woody plant species. Biomass of the domesticated and wild animals was increased by a higher quality of grass.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Pastoralism is found in many variations throughout the world. Composition of herds, management practices, social organization and all other aspects of pastoralism vary between areas and between social groups. Many traditional practices have also had to adapt to the changing circumstance of the modern world, including climatic conditions affecting the availability of grasses. [[Ranch]]es of the United States and [[sheep station]]s and [[cattle station]]s of Australia are seen by some as modern variations.

==Origins==
[[Image:Sameul Daniell - Kora-Khokhoi preparing to move - 1805.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Khoikhoi]] dismantling their huts, preparing to move to new pastures. Aquatint by [[Samuel Daniell]] (1805).  The Khoikhoi practiced pastoralism for thousands of years in [[southern Africa]].]]
One theory is that pastoralism was created from [[mixed farming]]. Bates and Lees proposed that it was the incorporation of irrigation into farming which ensued in specialization.&lt;ref name=leesbates&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lees|first1=Susan H.|last2=Bates|first2=Daniel G.|title=The Origins of Specialized Nomadic Pastoralism: A Systemic Model|journal=American Antiquity|date=1974|volume=39|issue=2|pages=187–193|doi=10.2307/279581|jstor=279581}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advantages of mixed farming include reducing risk of failure, spreading labour, and re-utilizing resources. The importance of these advantages and disadvantages to different farmers differs according to the sociocultural preferences of the farmers and the biophysical conditions as determined by rainfall, radiation, soil type, and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mixed crop-livestock farming|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/004/Y0501E/y0501e03.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The increased productivity of irrigation agriculture led to an increase in population and an added impact on resources. Bordering areas of land remained in use for animal breeding. This meant that large distances had to be covered by herds to collect sufficient forage. Specialization occurred as a result of the increasing importance of both intensive agriculture and pastoralism. Both agriculture and pastoralism developed alongside each other, with continuous interactions.&lt;ref name=leesbates /&gt;

There is another theory that suggests pastoralism evolved from [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]]. Hunters of wild goats and sheep were knowledgeable about herd mobility and the needs of the animals. Such hunters were mobile and followed the herds on their seasonal rounds. Undomesticated herds were chosen to become more controllable for the proto-pastoralist nomadic hunter and gatherer groups by [[taming]] and [[domestication|domesticating]] them. Hunter-gatherers' strategies in the past have been very diverse and contingent upon the local environment conditions, like those of mixed farmers. Foraging strategies have included hunting or trapping [[big game hunting|big game]] and smaller animals, fishing, collecting shellfish or insects, and gathering wild plant foods such as fruits, seeds, and nuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Hunting and Gathering Culture|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/277071/hunting-and-gathering-culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; These diverse strategies for survival amongst the migratory herds could also provide an evolutionary route towards nomadic pastoralism.

==Resources==
Pastoralism occurs in uncultivated areas. Wild animals eat the forage from the marginal lands and humans survive from milk, blood, and often meat of the herds and often trade by-products like [[wool]] and [[milk]] for [[money]] and [[food]].&lt;ref&gt;(Bates, 1998:105)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastoralists do not exist at basic [[subsistence]]. Pastoralists often compile wealth and participate in international trade. Pastoralists have trade relations with agriculturalists, [[Horticulture#Anthropology|horticulturalists]], and other groups. Pastoralists are not extensively dependent on milk, blood, and meat of their herd. McCabe noted that when common property institutions are created, in long-lived communities, resource sustainability is much higher, which is evident in the East African [[grasslands]] of pastoralist populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Emilio F.|title=People and06|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-4051-0572-9|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it needs to be noted that the property rights structure is only one of the many different parameters that affect the sustainability of resources, and common or private property per se, does not necessarily lead to sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Peter|date=2000|title=China’s Rangelands under Stress: A Comparative Study of Pasture Commons in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-7660.00159/abstract|journal=Development and Change|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=385–412|doi=10.1111/1467-7660.00159|issn=1467-7660|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pastoralists supplement herding with hunting and gathering, fishing and/or small-scale farming or [[pastoral farming]].

===Mobility===
Mobility allows pastoralists to adapt to the environment, which opens up the possibility for both fertile and infertile regions to support human existence. Important components of pastoralism include low population density, mobility, vitality, and intricate information systems. The system is transformed to fit the environment rather than adjusting the environment to support the "food production system."&lt;ref&gt;(Bates, 1998:104)&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile pastoralists can often cover a radius of a hundred to five hundred kilometers.

Pastoralists and their livestock have impacted the environment. Lands long used for pastoralism have transformed under the forces of grazing livestock and [[Controlled burn|anthropogenic fire]]. Fire was a method of revitalizing pastureland and preventing forest regrowth. The collective environmental weights of fire and livestock browsing have transformed landscapes in many parts of the world. Fire has permitted pastoralists to tend the land for their livestock. Political boundaries are based on environmental boundaries.&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Emilio F.|title=People and Nature: An Introduction to Human Ecological Relations|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-4051-0572-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Maquis shrubland]]s of the Mediterranean region are dominated by [[pyrophyte|pyrophytic]] plants that thrive under conditions of anthropogenic fire and livestock grazing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen J. Pyne|Pyne, Stephen J.]] (1997) ''Vestal Fire: An Environmental History, Told through Fire, of Europe and Europe's Encounter with the World''. Seattle and London: University of Washington Press. {{ISBN|0-295-97596-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nomadic pastoralists]] have a global food-producing strategy depending on the management of herd animals for meat, skin, wool, milk, blood, manure, and transport. Nomadic pastoralism is practiced in different climates and environments with daily movement and seasonal migration. Pastoralists are among the most flexible populations. Pastoralist societies have had field armed men protect their livestock and their people and then to return into a disorganized pattern of foraging. The products of the herd animals are the most important resources, although the use of other resources, including domesticated and wild plants, hunted animals, and goods accessible in a market economy are not excluded. The boundaries between states impact the viability of subsistence and trade relations with cultivators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Emilio F.|title=People and Nature: An Introduction to Human Ecological Relations|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-4051-0571-2|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastoralist strategies typify effective adaptation to the environment.&lt;ref name="fagan99"&gt;Fagan, B. (1999) "Drought Follows the Plow", Chapter 11 of ''Floods, Famines and Emperors'': Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Precipitation differences are evaluated by pastoralists. In East Africa, different animals are taken to specific regions throughout the year that corresponds to the seasonal patterns of precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giulio Angioni]] (1989) ''I pascoli erranti'': Liguori&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transhumance]] is the seasonal migration of livestock and pastoralists between higher and lower pastures.

Some pastoralists are constantly moving, which may put them at odds with sedentary people of towns and cities. The resulting conflicts can result in war for disputed lands. These disputes are recorded in ancient times in the Middle East, as well as for East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Peter|date=2000|title=The Myth of Desertification at China’s Northwestern Frontier: The Case of Ningxia Province, 1929-1958|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009770040002600304|journal=Modern China|language=en|volume=26|issue=3|pages=348–395|doi=10.1177/009770040002600304|issn=0097-7004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Peter|date=2003|title=Mao's War against Nature?

Different mobility patterns can be observed: [[Somali people|Somali]] pastoralists keep their animals in one of the harshest environments but they have evolved of the centuries. Somalis have well developed pastoral culture where complete system of life and governance has been refined. [[Somali poetry]] depicts humans interactions, pastoral animals, beasts on the prowl, and other natural things such the rain, celestial events and historic events of significance. 
 
Mobility was an important strategy for the [[Ariaal people|Ariaal]]; however with the loss of grazing land impacted by the growth in population, severe drought, the expansion of agriculture, and the expansion of commercial ranches and game parks, mobility was lost. The poorest families were driven out of pastoralism and into towns to take jobs. Few [[Ariaal people|Ariaal]] families benefited from education, healthcare, and income earning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=Patricia K.|title=Environmental Anthropology: From Pigs to Policies|year=2009|publisher=Waveland Press|location=United States|isbn=1-57766-581-3|pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flexibility of pastoralists to respond to environmental change was reduced by colonization. For example, mobility was limited in the Sahel region of Africa with settlement being encouraged. The population tripled and sanitation and medical treatment were improved.

The Afar pastoralists in Ethiopia uses an indigenous communication method called ''dagu'' for information. This helps them in getting crucial information about climate and availability of pastures at various locations.

===Information===
Pastoralists have mental maps of the value of specific environments at different times of year. Pastoralists have an understanding of ecological processes and the environment.&lt;ref name=Wilson92&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=K. B.|title=Re-Thinking the Pastoral Ecological Impact in East Africa|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography Letters|date=1992|volume=2|issue=4|pages=143–144|doi=10.2307/2997644|jstor=2997644}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information sharing is vital for creating knowledge through the networks of linked societies.

Pastoralists produce food in the world’s harshest environments, and pastoral production supports the livelihoods of rural populations on almost half of the world’s land. Several hundred million people are pastoralists, mostly in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]. Pastoralists manage [[rangeland]]s covering about a third of the Earth’s terrestrial surface and are able to produce food where crop production is not possible.

Pastoralism has been shown, "based on a review of many studies, to be between 2 and 10 times more productive per unit of land than the capital intensive alternatives that have been put forward". However, many of these benefits go unmeasured and are frequently squandered by policies and investments that seek to replace pastoralism with more capital intensive modes of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGahey|first1=D.|last2=Davies|first2=J.|last3=Hagelberg|first3=N.|last4=Ouedraogo|first4=R.|year=2014|title=Pastoralism and the Green Economy -- a natural nexus?|publisher=IUCN and UNEP|location=Nairobi|isbn=978-2-8317-1689-3|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/44878|pages=x+58}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have traditionally suffered from poor understanding, marginalization and exclusion from dialogue. The Pastoralist Knowledge Hub, managed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN serves as a knowledge repository on technical excellence on pastoralism as well as "a neutral forum for exchange and alliance building among pastoralists and stakeholders working on pastoralist issues".&lt;ref&gt;FAO, 2016.

==== Pastoralism and farm animal genetic resource ====

There is a variation in genetic makeup of the farm animals driven mainly by natural and human based selection.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wollny|first=Clemens B.A|title=The need to conserve farm animal genetic resources in Africa: should policy makers be concerned?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0921-8009(03)00089-2|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=45|issue=3|pages=341–351|doi=10.1016/s0921-8009(03)00089-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pastoralists in large part of Sub Saharan Africa are preferring livestock breeds which are adapted to their environment and able to tolerate drought and diseases to mention the few.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zander|first=K.K.|last2=Drucker|first2=A.G.|last3=Holm-Müller|first3=K.|title=Costing the conservation of animal genetic resources: The case of Borana cattle in Ethiopia and Kenya|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2008.11.003|journal=Journal of Arid Environments|volume=73|issue=4-5|pages=550–556|doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2008.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in other animal production systems these breeds are discouraged and more productive exotic ones are favored.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This situation could not be left unaddressed due to the changes in market preferences and climate all over the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J.|first=Philipsson,|last2=Ally|first2=Okeyo Mwai,|date=2006|title=Global perspectives on animal genetic resources for sustainable agriculture and food production in the tropics|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10568/3665|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could lead to changes in livestock diseases occurrence and decline forage quality and availability. Hence pastoralists are conserving farm animal genetic through community based conservation (CBC) of local livestock breeds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Generally conserving farm animal genetic resources under pastoralism is advantageous in terms of reliability and associated cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paiva|first=Samuel Rezende|last2=McManus|first2=Concepta M.|last3=Blackburn|first3=Harvey|title=Conservation of animal genetic resources – A new tact|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2016.09.010|journal=Livestock Science|volume=193|pages=32–38|doi=10.1016/j.livsci.2016.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tragedy of the commons===
[[Garrett Hardin|Hardin's]] ''[[Tragedy of the Commons]]'' (1968) described how common property resources, such as the land shared by pastoralists, eventually become overused and ruined.&lt;ref name=Hardin68&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardin|first1=Garrett|authorlink1=Garrett Hardin|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|journal=Science|date=1968|volume=162|issue=3859|pages=1243–1248|doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/162/3859/1243}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hardin's paper, the pastoralist land use strategy suffered criticisms of being unstable and a cause of [[environmental degradation]].&lt;ref name=Fratkin97&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fratkin|first1=Elliot|title=Pastoralism: Governance and Development Issues|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=1997|volume=26|pages=235–261|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.235|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Niger nomads flee drought 16 aug 2005.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] pastoralists and their herds flee south into [[Nigeria]] from [[Niger]] during the [[2005–06 Niger food crisis]].]]
Pastoralists in the [[Sahel]] zone in Africa were held responsible for the depletion of resources.&lt;ref name=Fratkin97 /&gt; The depletion of resources was actually triggered by a prior interference and punitive climate conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=P.|date=2001|title=Rangeland Degradation in North China Revisited?

However, recently it has been shown that pastoralism supports human existence in harsh environments and often represents a sustainable approach to land use.&lt;ref name=Wilson92 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11319">'''Patient choice''' is a concept introduced into the [[National Health Service|NHS]] in [[England]].  Most patients are supposed to be able to choose the clinician whom they want to provide them with healthcare and that money to pay for the service should follow their choice.  Before the advent of the internal market, in principle, a GP could refer a patient  to any specialist in the UK. When contracts were introduced in 1990 these were called  extracontractual referrals.  From 1999 the concept of Out of Area Treatments was developed. These referrals were not necessarily related to choice made by a patient. Specialised treatments were not, and are not, available in every area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beecham|first1=Linda|title=Out of area treatments will replace ECRs|journal=British Medical Journal|date=27 June 1998|volume=316|issue=7149|pmc=1113431|pmid=9641962|page=1988|doi=10.1136/bmj.316.7149.1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulations provide that a patient can choose to be seen by any [[NHS trust]], public body, commercial organisation or third sector body, provided it holds a “commissioning contract” either with [[NHS England]] or a [[Clinical Commissioning Group]] when they are referred by their [[General practitioner|GP]], community dentist or optometrist for treatment that is not identified as being immediately required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Health Service Commissioning Board and Clinical Commissioning Groups (Responsibilities and Standing Rules) Regulations 2012|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2996/contents/made|website=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=HMG|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Government’s mandate to [[NHS England]] for 2016-17 issued by [[Jeremy Hunt]] specifies “We want people to be empowered to shape and manage their own health and care and make meaningful choices, particularly for maternity services, people with long term conditions and end-of-life care”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Government’s mandate to NHS England for 2016-17|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/494485/NHSE_mandate_16-17_22_Jan.pdf|accessdate=10 January 2017|publisher=Department of Health|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
* 2002 - Patient choice [[Pilot program|pilots]] begin. Patients with [[Coronary disease]] are offered faster care from alternative providers
* 2003 - All NHS patients likely to wait more than 6 months for [[Inpatient care|inpatient treatment]], offered choice of quicker treatment at alternative provider
* January 2006 - patients referred to hospital could choose between at least 4 hospitals.
* April 2006 – launch of extended choice – patients have access to a national menu of hospitals including [[Foundation Trust]]s, [[Independent sector treatment centre|Independent Sector Treatment Centres]] (ISTCs) and Independent Sector (IS) providers on what is known as the Extended Choice Network.
* July 2007 – launch of Free Choice at a specialty level – patients have free choice in [[Orthopaedics]].
* December 2007 - patients have free choice in General [[Surgery]], [[Gynaecology]] and [[Cardiology]].
* April 2008 - Under what is known as Free Choice policy, most patients have been able to choose services from any hospital provider that is clinically appropriate and meets NHS standards and costs, including NHS Foundation Trusts, NHS [[Acute Trust]]s and many independent sector providers and their hospitals.
* December 2012  National Health Service Commissioning Board and Clinical Commissioning Groups (Responsibilities and Standing Rules) Regulations 2012
* April 2014 policy extended to mental health.  Guidance says "This means having a right to choose which team, led by a named healthcare professional, delivers their care and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interim Guidance: Implementing patients’ right to choose any clinically appropriate provider of mental health services|url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/guid-choice-prov-health.pdf|publisher=NHS England|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* October 2014 the [[Five Year Forward View]] asserts "We will make good on the NHS’ longstanding promise to give patients choice over where and how they receive care”.

==Exceptions to policy==
Around 80% patients referred by their GP to a first outpatient hospital appointment were eligible to choose the hospital. There are however some exceptions to hospital choice policy. These exceptions include those where speed of access is important such as suspected [[cancer]] 2 week wait referrals and urgent referrals such as suspected [[stroke]] and [[heart attack]]. Referrals to [[mental health]] and [[Maternity care|maternity services]] were excluded from the policy until April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mental health choice guidance published|url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/2014/12/mh-choice-guidance/|accessdate=10 January 2017|publisher=NHS England|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patients who are detained, and serving members of the armed forces are not entitled to exercise choice.

==NHS Constitution==
The [[NHS Constitution]] includes a right to choice. It states: You have the right to make choices about your NHS care and to information to support these choices. The options available to you will develop over time and depend on your individual needs.  It also repeats the requirements specified in the [[GP contract]]:  ''You have the right to choose your GP practice, and to be accepted by that practice unless there are reasonable grounds to refuse, in which case you will be informed of those reasons. You have the right to express a preference for using a particular doctor within your GP practice, and for the practice to try to comply.''

CCG and NHS England  are required by the regulations to “make arrangements” to give effect to the right of patients to exercise their patient choice.  It is for the clinician making the referral to decide whether it is clinically appropriate.  The right to choice only extends to a first appointment.  It does not imply that any chosen treatment must be paid for.  That would depend on the terms of the provider's contract.

[[Spire Healthcare]] complained to [[Monitor (NHS)]] in 2013 that the [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s in Blackpool, and in Fylde and Wyre were not doing enough to encourage patient choice, but their complaint was dismissed in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Private firm loses NHS choices case|url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/health/local-health/private-firm-loses-nhs-choices-case-1-6864481|accessdate=28 September 2014|publisher=Blackpool Gazette|date=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparing hospitals==
It is intended that patients can choose the hospital they are seen in by comparing clinical quality, waiting times, location and other patients' opinions. In order to enable patients to compare and choose hospitals the national NHS website established a hospital comparison tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/servicedirectories/Pages/ServiceSearch.aspx?ServiceType=Hospital |title=Hospital location search - NHS Choices |website=Nhs.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information that users can access to compare hospital performance can include:
* The number of procedures carried out
* Waiting times
* Average time spent in hospital
* Patient outcomes (Readmission rates)
* Rates of [[infection]]
* Overall hospital performance (Care Quality Commission Statistics)
* What patients say about their overall care
* What visitors to www.nhs.uk say
* Results from the national [[Statistical survey|survey]] of inpatients
* Quality of food
* Car parking
* [[Disabled access]]

Using the hospital comparison tool is supposed to be quite simple. Users enter their [[postcode]] and the condition that they are being referred for.

===Booking appointments===
IN 2005 an electronic booking service known as [[Choose and Book]] was introduced across the NHS in England. This service enabled GPs and patients to [[shortlist]] a list of clinically appropriate hospitals for the patient to choose from, and lets the patient make appointments with hospitals either online or over the phone.Choose and Book was based around [[Directory of Services]] which includes the majority of NHS hospital services for GPs to shortlist for their patients to choose from. GPs were given financial incentives to use the system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chooseandbook.nhs.uk/staff/implement/dos |title=NHS e-Referral Service - NHS Digital |website=Chooseandbook.nhs.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choose and Book was replaced by the [[NHS e-Referral Service]] in June 2015.

==Maternity services==
The 1993 report, Changing Childbirth, called choice, control, and continuity of carer for the mother as the most important tenets of maternity care, but its recommendations were not delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Changing Childbirth again? Implications of the NSF|url=https://www.rcm.org.uk/news-views-and-analysis/analysis/changing-childbirth-again-implications-of-the-nsf|accessdate=12 January 2017|publisher=Royal College of Midwives|date=April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baroness Cumberlege]] conducted a review of maternity services for NHS England in 2015. Better Births, the report of the national maternity review recommended that all women should have the choice to give birth where they want, with the support of the same midwife throughout pregnancy, labour and the early weeks of motherhood, with control over a  personal maternity care budget of £3,000 to be spent on the NHS care they choose.  This would be driven by a personal care plan, updated during pregnancy. Every woman should have an [[electronic patient record]] which they can access and add to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National maternity review calls for £3,000 'birth budgets'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/23/national-maternity-review-calls-for-personal-care-budgets|accessdate=11 January 2017|publisher=Guardian|date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
The proportion of patients who reported that they were offered a choice of provider rose steadily until 2010 when 32% of those responding to the inpatient survey reported that they had been offered a choice.  By 2013 the proportion had fallen to 27%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Progress on choice of provider has stalled, figures show|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/acute-care/progress-on-choice-of-provider-has-stalled-figures-show/5073933.article#.VCiBlBLGBJ0|accessdate=28 September 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Post-Hospitalist Medicine''' is the discipline concerned with the medical care of post-acute [[patients]]. [[Physicians]] whose primary professional focus is post-hospital care are post-hospitalists.
Typical community PCPs and most other NP/PA/extender models do not have the time or ability to effectively monitor patient care when the patient is in a post-acute facility. As a result, increased hospitalizations, readmissions and unnecessary ER utilization occur frequently, increasing overall [[health care]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/GeneralMedicine/why-hospital-readmissions-from-nursing-homes-dont-matter Why Hospital Readmissions from Nursing Homes Don’t Matter&lt;/ref&gt; When patients become ill with an urgent or non-emergency problem, most traditional care models typically direct the patient to the ER, utilizing the ER as an outpatient clinic rather than going to the post-acute facility, examining and treating the patient on-site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amednews.com/article/20080128/profession/301289967/7/ Study ties hospitalist care to shorter patient stays, American Medical News by the American Medical Association&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, other models providing limited results and exposure to facilities include the following:
* Traditional attending physicians (PCPs) and/or medical directors
* NP practices – Independent NPs provide post-acute rounding services on behalf of collaborative physicians
* Group practice extenders – Employed extenders of traditional practices provide post-acute rounding services.
* Hospitalist extenders – Employed extenders of hospitalist programs provide post-acute rounding services.
* Health system extenders – Employed extenders of hospitals/health systems provide post-acute rounding services.

Post-hospitalist medical services focus on providing better care to meet the needs of high-risk, medically complex patients with the following common diagnoses:
* [[Asthma]]	
* Major Depressive Disorder
* [[Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease]] (COPD)
* [[Osteoporosis]]
* [[Congestive Heart Failure]] (CHF)
* End Stage [[Renal Disease]]
* [[Dehydration]]
* [[Hepatitis C]]
* [[Pneumonia]]
* [[Hypertension]]
* [[Urinary Tract Infections]] (UTI)
* [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]
* [[Diabetes Mellitus]]
* Pre and/or Postoperative Care
* [[Coronary Artery Disease]]
* Medication Reconciliation
In many instances, this population of patient has multiple diagnoses, co-morbidities and their medical needs are extensive. 
In the past, these patients would have stayed in the hospital much longer and at much higher overall health care costs. Today, managing their care in less costly post-acute settings such as LTACs, Rehab Centers, Skilled Nursing and Long-Term Care Facilities is possible with the use of Post-Hospitalist Medical Services being provided on-site in these settings. Post Hospitalists provide these specialized medical services exclusively in these various types of post-acute facilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe078208  The Hospitalist Movement — Time to Move On, New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/ref&gt;

The term post-hospitalist was first attributed to Thomas Prose, MD, MPH, MBA, who coined the term in 2012. Prose founded General Medicine P.C.—a health care practice devoted to the practice of post-hospitalist medicine in 1983. The practice of post-hospitalist medicine is still new in the United States and—while it has not yet reached widespread adoption—is one of the faster growing of medical specialties.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265014190_9_of_the_top_10_MCOs_in_the_U.S._Have_Contracted_With_The_Post-Hospitalist_Company_General_Medicine 9 of the top 10 MCOs in the U.S. Have Contracted With The Post-Hospitalist Company, General Medicine&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
As a relatively new specialty, only recently has certification for specialty experience and training for hospital medicine been offered. The American Board of Hospital Medicine (ABHM), a Member Board of the American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS), was founded in 2009. The ABHM was North America’s first board of certification devoted exclusively to hospital medicine. In September 2009, the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) created a program that provides general internists practicing in hospital settings the opportunity to maintain Internal Medicine Certification with a Focused Practice in Hospital Medicine (FPHM).

==Quality==
Research shows that hospitalists reduce the length of stay, treatment costs and improve the overall efficiency of care for hospitalized patients. Post-hospitalists are leaders on several quality improvement initiatives in key areas including transitions of care, co-management of patients, reducing hospital acquired diseases and optimizing the care of patients.

[[File:Heim_Pál_sírja.jpg|thumb|Monument to Pál Heim]]
'''Pál Heim''' (Budapest, 30 November 1875 – Budapest, 23 October 1929; {{lang-hu|Heim Pál}}) was a Hungarian pediatrician and university professor.

He gained his medical degree in 1897 from the [[University of Budapest]]. In 1901 he got a position at a hospital in Budapest, where he specialized in treating babies and children. He served as a doctor in the [[First World War]], and in 1916 he became leader of a hospital for babies in Budapest. Since 1918 he  also taught at the university, where he became rector in 1921. He then went to the university in [[Pécs]], where he lived until 1929. He organized a network of nurses to babies, who became known as the "Heim Sisters".

In the autumn of 1928, his former mentor [[János Bókai]] retired as head of pediatrics, and Heim was invited to take the post. He accepted the invitation, although he was sorry to leave Pécs. A few months after his appointment, he died from pneumonia at the age of 54.  His body was interred at [[Kerepesi cemetery]].

[[Pál Heim Children's Hospital]] in Budapest is named for him.

She moved from Germany to Pakistan and devoted more than 55 years of her life fighting [[leprosy]] in [[Pakistan]].

== Early life ==

Pfau was born on 9 September 1929&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruth-pfau-schule.de/index.php/ruth-pfau|title=DR. RUTH PFAU |website=Ruth-pfau.schule.de|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Leipzig]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], to [[Lutheran]] [[Protestant]] parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2017/08/14/sister-ruth-pfau-mother-teresa-pakistan-obituary/ |title=Sister Ruth Pfau, 'Mother Teresa of Pakistan' – obituary |work=The Telegraph |date=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aqeel"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dailytimes.com.pk/pakistan/12-Aug-17/master-of-her-own-destiny-saviour-of-others |title=Master of her own destiny, saviour of others |last1=Aqeel |first1=Asif |work=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]] |date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had four sisters and one brother. Her home was destroyed by bombing during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Following the post-war [[Soviets|Soviet]] occupation of [[East Germany]] she escaped to [[West Germany]] along with her family, and chose medicine as her future career.&lt;ref name="ET3"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rahman|first1=Faiza|title=Dr Ruth Pfau: The magic healer|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/676329/the-magic-healer/|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[Express Tribune]]|date=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, she studied medicine at the [[University of Mainz]].&lt;ref name="The News"&gt;{{cite news|title=State funeral announced for Dr Ruth Pfau|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/222720-Mother-Teresa-of-Pakistan-Dr-Ruth-Pfau|accessdate=10 August 2017|work=[[The News International]]|date=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Pfau met several times with a Dutch Christian woman, who was a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] survivor and currently dedicated her life to "preaching love and forgiveness". After "her life-changing experience", Pfau left "a romantic association" with a fellow student and got involved in discussions in Mainz's philosophy and classical literature department.&lt;ref name="Aqeel" /&gt; After completing her clinical examination, Pfau moved to [[Marburg]] to carry on her clinical studies. Then she was baptized as an [[Evangelical Protestant]] in 1951, before her conversion to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pfau2007|Pfau (2007)]], pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Sam|title=Dr. Ruth Pfau, Savior of Lepers in Pakistan, Dies at 87|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/world/asia/dr-ruth-pfau-savior-of-lepers-in-pakistan-dies-at-87.html|accessdate=August 16, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pfau stated that she learned the "courage of being human" from Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] through [[Josef Pieper]]'s writing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pfau2007|Pfau (2007)]], pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; She joined a Catholic parish, and she was greatly influenced by [[Romano Guardini]]'s ''[[The Lord (book)|The Lord]]'' in this period.&lt;ref name="Aqeel" /&gt;

In 1957,&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; she travelled to [[Paris]] and joined the Daughters of the Heart of Mary, a [[Catholic]] order.&lt;ref name="Aqeel" /&gt; She said, "When you receive such a calling, you cannot turn it down, for it is not you who has made the choice. ... God has chosen you for himself."&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; The order later sent her to southern [[India]]; however, in 1960,&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; a visa issue meant she became stuck in [[Karachi]].&lt;ref name="BBC2" /&gt; She travelled to various parts of Pakistan&lt;ref name="ET2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kazi|first1=Mudaser|title=Pakistan's magic healer Dr Ruth Pfau passes away|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1477955/pakistani-lepers-messiah-dr-ruth-pfau-passes-away/|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[Express Tribune]]|date=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and across the border to Afghanistan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rafi|first1=Haneen|title=Dr Ruth Pfau honoured by German govt|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1227919/dr-ruth-pfau-honoured-by-german-govt|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to rescue patients who were abandoned by their families or locked in small rooms for a lifetime.

== Life in Pakistan ==

{{quote|Not all of us can prevent a war; but most of us can help ease sufferings—of the body and the soul.|source=Ruth Pfau&lt;ref name="ET3" /&gt;}}

In 1960, aged 31, she decided to dedicate the rest of her life to the people of [[Pakistan]] and their battle against [[leprosy]] outbreaks. While in Karachi, by chance she visited the Lepers’ Colony behind McLeod Road (now [[I. I. Chundrigar Road]]) near the [[Karachi City railway station|City Railway Station]].&lt;ref name="DAWN"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mustafa|first1=Zubeida|title=Candle of hope|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1338320|accessdate=10 August 2017|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here she decided that the care of patients would be her life's calling. She started with medical treatment for the leprosy patients in a hut in this slum. The [[Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.malc.org.pk/about-malc.html|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded (which later branched out into tuberculosis and blindness prevention programmes)&lt;ref name="DAWN" /&gt; and social work for the leprosy patients and their family members was started by Dr. I. K. Gill. A Leprosy Clinic was bought in April 1963 and patients from all over Karachi, Pakistan, and even from Afghanistan came for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leprosy in Pakistan contained, says Dr Ruth Pfau|url=http://www.dawn.com/2004/02/02/nat24.htm|website=Dawn.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, she was appointed as the Federal Advisor on Leprosy to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of [[Government of Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="The News" /&gt; Pfau went to distant areas of Pakistan where there were no medical facilities for leprosy patients. She collected donations in Germany and Pakistan and cooperated with hospitals in [[Rawalpindi]] and Karachi.
In recognition of her service to the country, she was awarded Pakistani citizenship in 1988.&lt;ref name=ucan&gt;[http://www.ucanews.com/story-archive/?post_name=/1999/10/01/nuns-leprosy-service-a-christian-window-to-muslims-karachi-pakistan-ucan-a-german-catholic-nun-was-feted-on-her-70th-birthday-for-her-ongoing-work-to-eradicate-leprosy-in-pakistan-a-service-that-she-s&amp;post_id=14531 German Catholic nun feted on her 70th birthday for her ongoing work to eradicate leprosy in Pakistan"], UCANews, 1 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to her continued efforts, in 1996 the [[World Health Organization]] declared Pakistan one of the first countries in Asia to have controlled leprosy.&lt;ref name="DAWN3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr Ruth Pfau: Light to Pakistan's lepers|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1094184|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', the number of leprosy cases nationwide dropped significantly from 19,398 in the early 1980s to 531 in 2016.&lt;ref name="DAWN" /&gt;

On 9 September 1999, Archbishop of Karachi, [[Simeon Anthony Pereira]], celebrated a [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]] at [[Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Karachi|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] to celebrate Sr. Pfau’s 70th birthday, which was attended by Christians together with Muslims.&lt;ref name=ucan /&gt;

== Death ==

In the early morning on 10 August 2017, around 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Pakistan Standard Time|PST]], Pfau died at the [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi|Aga Khan University Hospital]] in Karachi after being admitted there due to respiratory problems on 4 August 2017. She was put on a ventilator after her condition worsened on 6 August.&lt;ref name="ET"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kazi|first1=Mudaser|title=Pakistani lepers' messiah Dr Ruth Pfau hospitalised and her condition's worsening|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1477635/dr-ruth-pfau-pakistans-mother-teresa-hospitalised-conditions-worsening/|accessdate=10 August 2017|work=[[Express Tribune]]|date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan’s leprosy fighter Dr Ruth Pfau passes away|url=http://www.muslimglobal.com/2017/08/pakistans-leprosy-fighter-dr-ruth-pfau.html|accessdate=8 September 2017|publisher=Muslim Global}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DAWN 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1350753|title=Light to Pakistan's leprosy patients, Dr Ruth Pfau passes away in Karachi|publisher=DAWN|date=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; But she refused the life support machine, which made her doctors remove it the next day,&lt;ref name="DAWN 2"/&gt; since she wished for "living a natural life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/pakistan/dr-ruth-pfau-departs-world-with-three-last-wishes/ |title=Dr. Ruth Pfau departs the world with three last wishes |first=Haider Ali |last=Sindhu |date=August 19, 2017 |work=[[Daily Pakistan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pfau had been dealing with several health problems due to her advancing age, including kidney and [[heart disease]],&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; for which she had been undergoing treatment for several years.&lt;ref name="DAWN 2" /&gt;

=== Reaction ===

President [[Mamnoon Hussain]] issued the statement: “Dr Pfau’s services to end leprosy in Pakistan cannot be forgotten. She left her homeland and made Pakistan her home to serve humanity. Pakistani nation salutes Dr Pfau and her great tradition to serve humanity will be continued.”&lt;ref name="Gulf News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jamal|first1=Sana|title=Pakistan’s ‘Mother Teresa’ dies at 87|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/asia/pakistan/pakistan-s-mother-teresa-dies-at-87-1.2072127|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[Gulf News]]|date=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[Shahid Khaqan Abbasi]] said: “Dr Ruth Pfau may have been born in Germany, [but] her heart was always in Pakistan.” He further added that, “she came here at the dawn of a young nation looking to make lives better for those afflicted by disease, and in doing so, found herself a home. We will remember her for her courage, her loyalty, her service to the eradication of leprosy, and most of all, her patriotism.”&lt;ref name="Gulf News" /&gt; He also announced that a [[state funeral]] would be held for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/pakistan-mourning-loss-german-nun-ruth-pfau-170810074719259.html|title=Why Pakistan is mourning loss of German nun Ruth Pfau|work=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40886234|title=Ruth Pfau: Pakistan's 'Mother Teresa' dies aged 87|publisher=BBC News|date=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief of Army Staff [[Qamar Bajwa]] referred to Pfau as an "ambassador of humanity".&lt;ref name="DAWN 2" /&gt;

On 19 August 2017, her body [[lay in state]] at the [[Holy Family Hospital, Karachi|Holy Family Hospital]] in Karachi ahead of the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Video: Last sight of Dr Ruth Pfau at Holy Family hospital|url=https://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/2017/08/video-last-sight-dr-ruth-pfau-holy-family-hospital/|accessdate=20 August 2017|work=[[Samaa TV]]|date=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state funeral for Pfau was held at [[Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Karachi|Saint Patrick's Cathedral]], in front of which the flags of Pakistan and [[Vatican City]] were raised at half mast,&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40986492 |title=Ruth Pfau: State funeral for Pakistan's 'Mother Teresa' |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Archbishop [[Joseph Coutts]] presiding over the [[Requiem]].&lt;ref name="Kazi"/&gt; The [[Pakistani flag]] was draped over her coffin and a [[19-gun salute]] was offered by contingents of all three [[Pakistan Armed Force]]s.

== Legacy ==

Dr Ruth Pfau is well respected by the Muslims in Pakistan who were the majority of patients in the [[Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre]].&lt;ref name="Amir"/&gt; Saleem Maseh Amir says that she never talked about religions, yet "her faith, service, and love" show actual representations of the spirit to animate interreligious relations.&lt;ref name="Amir"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Studia Missionalia |volume=55 |date=2006 |title=Being a Missionary in Pakistan |location=Roma |publisher=Editrice Pontificia Università Gregoriana |first=Saleem |last=Amir, OFM |page=282 |isbn=88-7839-070-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its title, the series does not actually deal with situations related to [[public sex]] itself, but rather confronts people who are not comfortable openly discussing their sex lives.&lt;ref name="boucott"/&gt;

Due to its inappropriate content, the series was disapproved by the [[Parents Television Council]], which criticised the network's programming decisions and described the show as "a desperate move to attract attention."&lt;ref name="boucott"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Christian Today]]|accessdate=December 29, 2015|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/desperate.tlc.slammed.for.replacing.19.kids.and.counting.with.sex.in.public/66258.htm|title='Desperate' TLC slammed for replacing '19 Kids and Counting' with 'Sex in Public'|date=October 2, 2015|first=Czarina|last=Ong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual and reproductive health and rights''' or ''SRHR'' is an  of [[human rights]] applied to [[sexuality]] and [[reproduction]]. It is a combination of four fields that in some contexts are more or less distinct from each other, but less so or not at all in other contexts. These four fields are [[sexual health]], [[Universal Declaration of Sexual Rights|sexual rights]], [[reproductive health]] and [[reproductive rights]]. In the concept of SRHR, these four fields are treated as separate but inherently intertwined.

Distinctions between these four fields are not always made. Sexual health and reproductive health are sometimes treated as synonymous to each other, as are sexual rights and reproductive rights. In some cases, sexual rights are included in the term sexual health, or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ippf.org/resource/IPPF-Charter-Sexual-and-Reproductive-Rights|title=IPPF Charter on Sexual and Reproductive Rights Guidelines | date = 22 November 2011 | publisher= IPPF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do different [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs) and governments{{cn|date=May 2018}} use different terminologies, but different terminologies are often used within the same organization.

Some of the notable global NGOs that fight for sexual and reproductive health and rights include [[International Planned Parenthood Federation|IPPF]] (International Planned Parenthood Federation), [[ILGA]] (International Lesbian and Gay Alliance), WAS ([[World Association for Sexual Health]] - formerly known as World Association for Sexology), and International HIV/AIDS Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aidsalliance.org/TechnicalThemeDetails.aspx?Id=10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131206105333/http://www.aidsalliance.org/TechnicalThemeDetails.aspx?Id=10 | archive-date = 6 December 2013 | dead-url = yes | title = SRHR and HIV | publisher = International HIV/AIDS Alliance | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurongos.org/Default.aspx?ID=1495 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110616041715/http://www.eurongos.org/Default.aspx?ID=1495 | archive-date = 16 June 2011 | dead-url = yes | title = Members of EuroNGOs | publisher = EuroNGOs | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Government-run family planning programs first began in the 1950s{{Where|date=June 2018}}.&lt;ref name="Visaria_1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Visaria | first = Leela | last2 = Jejeebhoy | first2 = Shireen | last3 = Merrick | first3 = Tom | name-list-format = vanc | date = 1999 | title = From Family Planning to Reproductive Health: Challenges Facing India | jstor = 2991871 | journal = International Family Planning Perspectives | volume = 25 | pages = S44–S49 | doi=10.2307/2991871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the main objectives of these programs were often centered around population control for economic growth and development.&lt;ref name="Ledbetter_1984"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledbetter R | title = Thirty years of family planning in India | journal = Asian Survey | volume = 24 | issue = 7 | pages = 736–58 | date = 1984 | pmid = 11616645 | doi = 10.2307/2644186 | jstor = 2644186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the [[International Conference on Population and Development|International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD)]] in Cairo, Egypt marked a significant shift in perspective in regards to reproductive health and is considered to be the birth of the modern SRHR movement.&lt;ref name="Glasier_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glasier A, Gülmezoglu AM, Schmid GP, Moreno CG, Van Look PF | title = Sexual and reproductive health: a matter of life and death | journal = Lancet | volume = 368 | issue = 9547 | pages = 1595–607 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17084760 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69478-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the conference, debates surrounding family planning shifted from that of economics to that of public health and human rights.&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fincher RA | title = International Conference on Population and Development | url = https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/envpola24&amp;id=309 | journal = Environmental Policy and Law | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | date = 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Program of Action (PoA) was developed by the end of the ICPD and was approved and adopted by 179 countries.&lt;ref name="ICPD"&gt;{{cite web | title = Programme of Action | url = https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/programme_of_action_Web%20ENGLISH.pdf | work = International Conference on Population and Development | location = Cairo | date = September 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PoA affirmed sexual and reproductive health as a universal human right and outlined global goals and objectives for improving reproductive heath based around central themes of free choice, women's empowerment, and viewing sexual and reproductive health in terms of physical and emotional well-being.&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994" /&gt; The PoA outlined a series of goals, based on a central mission of achieving universal access to reproductive health worldwide, that were aimed to be accomplished by 2015.&lt;ref name="Abrejo_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abrejo FG, Shaikh BT, Saleem S | title = ICPD to MDGs: Missing links and common grounds | journal = Reproductive Health | volume = 5 | pages = 4 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18783600 | pmc = 2546384 | doi = 10.1186/1742-4755-5-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)]] were developed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sachs JD, McArthur JW | title = The Millennium Project: a plan for meeting the Millennium Development Goals | journal = Lancet | volume = 365 | issue = 9456 | pages = 347–53 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15664232 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(05)17791-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and although reproductive health was not explicitly stated as one of the goals, it became an important component to Goals 3, 4, and 5.&lt;ref name="Glasier_2006" /&gt;  In 2010, the original PoA was revisited by the [[United Nations]] and updated to reflect their objective of achieving universal reproductive health care by 2015.&lt;ref name="ICPD" /&gt; When the MDGs and ICPD PoA phased out in 2015, the next objectives for SRHR were folded into the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], the next iteration of the MDGs which outline objectives to combat poverty through 2030.&lt;ref name="Tangcharoensathien_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tangcharoensathien V, Mills A, Palu T | title = Accelerating health equity: the key role of universal health coverage in the Sustainable Development Goals | journal = BMC Medicine | volume = 13 | pages = 101 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25925656 | pmc = 4415234 | doi = 10.1186/s12916-015-0342-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual health==
The [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/sexual_health/en/|title=Sexual health|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines sexual health as: "Sexual health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality. It requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence."

==Sexual rights==
Unlike the other three aspects of SRHR, the struggle for sexual rights include, and focus on, sexual pleasure and emotional sexual expression. One platform for this struggle is the [[World Association for Sexual Health|WAS]] Declaration of Sexual Rights.

The Platform for Action from the [[1995 Beijing Conference on Women]] established that human rights include the right of women freely and without coercion, violence or discrimination, to have control over and make decisions concerning their own sexuality, including their own sexual and reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/ | title = Beijing Platform for Action, paragraphs 92, 93 and 96 | publisher = United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women | date = September 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This paragraph has been interpreted by some countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sweden's international policy on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights" | url = http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/574/a/61489 | website = www.regeringen.se | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001157/http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/574/a/61489 | archivedate = 2014-05-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the applicable definition of women’s sexual rights. The UN Commission on Human Rights has established that if women had more power, their ability to protect themselves against violence would be strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Human Rights Resolution E/CN.4/RES/2005/84: The protection of human rights in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) | url = http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-2005-84.doc | date = 21 April 2005 | author = The Commission on Human Rights | publisher = The United Nations  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 20 April 2005 | title = Human Rights Resolution E/CN.4/RES/2005/41: Elimination of violence against women | url = http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-2005-41.doc | author = The Commission on Human Rights | publisher = The United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 14th World Congress of Sexology (Hong Kong, 1999), the WAS adopted the [[Declaration of Sexual Rights]], which originally included 11 sexual rights. It was heavily revised and expanded in March 2014 by the WAS Advisory Council to include 16 sexual rights:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsexology.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/declaration_of_sexual_rights_sep03_2014.pdf |title=Declaration of sexual rights' |publisher=Worldsexology.org |date=2014-03-01 |access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Declaration influenced [[The Yogyakarta Principles]] (which were launched as a set of international principles relating to sexual orientation and gender identity on 26 March 2007), especially on the idea of each person's [[integrity]], and right to sexual and [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yogyakartaprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/A5_yogyakartaWEB-2.pdf | title = The Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity | work = Yogyakartaprinciples.org | date = 10 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the U.S. government said it would begin using the term "sexual rights" in discussions of human rights and global development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/us-government-says-it-will-now-use-the-term-sexual-rights/ar-AAer3sZ?li=AAa0dzB&amp;ocid=HPCDHP |title=US government says it will now use the term 'sexual rights' |publisher=Msn.com |date=2015-06-26 |access-date=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive health==
{{Main article|Reproductive health}}
Within the framework of the [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) definition of [[health]] as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, '''reproductive health''', or '''sexual health'''/'''hygiene''', addresses the reproductive processes, functions and system at all stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/reproductive_health/en/|title=WHO: Reproductive health|access-date=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reproductive health, therefore, implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying and [[Safer sex|safer sex life]] and that they have the capability to reproduce and the [[Family planning|freedom to decide]] if, when and how often to do so. One interpretation of this implies that men and women ought to be [[sex education|informed]] of and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of [[birth control]]; also access to appropriate [[reproductive medicine|health care services]] of [[sexual medicine|sexual]], [[reproductive medicine]] and implementation of health education programs to stress the importance of [[maternal health|women to go safely]] through [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] could provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant. On the other hand, individuals do face inequalities in reproductive health services. Inequalities vary based on socioeconomic status, education level, age, ethnicity, religion, and resources available in their environment. It is possible for example, that low income individuals lack the resources for appropriate health services and the knowledge to know what is appropriate for maintaining reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall KS, Moreau C, Trussell J | title = Determinants of and disparities in reproductive health service use among adolescent and young adult women in the United States, 2002-2008 | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 102 | issue = 2 | pages = 359–67 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22390451 | pmc = 3483992 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2011.300380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive Rights==
{{Main article|Reproductive rights}}
'''Reproductive rights''' are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref name="Cook_1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = Rebecca J. | last2 = Fathalla | first2 = Mahmoud F. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Advancing Reproductive Rights Beyond Cairo and Beijing|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives | date = September 1996 | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 115 | doi = 10.2307/2950752 | jstor = 2950752 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] defines reproductive rights as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of [[discrimination]], [[coercion]] and [[violence]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://who.int/reproductive-health/gender/index.html|title=Sexual and reproductive health | publisher = World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Goals and objectives ==
Despite frequent changes to frameworks, overall goals for SRHR remain little changed. As first stipulated at the ICPD, universal reproductive health care remains the ultimate objective, and with each new framework, targets are developed to progress towards this.&lt;ref name="Tangcharoensathien_2015" /&gt; In the original ICPD Program of Action, the primary call was for universal access to healthcare, including reproductive healthcare, family planning and sexual health.&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994" /&gt; Over time, these have expanded to include the right to access education regarding sexual and reproductive health, an end to [[female genital mutilation]], and increased women's empowerment in social, political, and cultural spheres.&lt;ref name="Glasier_2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994" /&gt;

Special goals and targets were also created to address adolescent sexual and reproductive health needs. Adolescents are often the most vulnerable to risks associated with sexual activity, including HIV, due to personal and social issues such as feelings of isolation, child marriage, and stigmatization.&lt;ref name="Hindin_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hindin MJ, Fatusi AO | title = Adolescent sexual and reproductive health in developing countries: an overview of trends and interventions | journal = International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 58–62 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19620089 | doi = 10.1363/ipsrh.35.058.09 | jstor = 40233805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments realized the importance of investing in the health of adolescents as a means of establishing future well-being for their societies.&lt;ref name="Chandra-Mouli_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandra-Mouli V, Svanemyr J, Amin A, Fogstad H, Say L, Girard F, Temmerman M | title = Twenty years after International Conference on Population and Development: where are we with adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights? | language = English | journal = The Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 56 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = S1-6 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25528975 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.09.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Commission on Population and Development]] developed a series of fundamental rights for adolescents including the right to comprehensive sex education, the right to decide all matters related to their sexuality, and access to sexual and reproductive health services without discrimination (including safe abortions wherever legal).&lt;ref name="Chandra-Mouli_2015" /&gt;

[[File:Vegetarian diet.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A variety of vegetarian food ingredients that are also vegan.]]
'''Vegetarian cuisine''' is based on [[food]] that meets [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian standards]] by not including [[meat]] and animal tissue products (such as [[gelatin]] or animal-derived [[rennet]]). For [[lacto-ovo vegetarianism]] (the most common type of vegetarianism in the [[Western world]]), [[Egg (food)|eggs]] and [[dairy product]]s, such as [[milk]] and [[cheese]], are permitted. For [[lacto vegetarianism]], the earliest known type of vegetarianism (recorded in [[India]]), [[dairy product]]s, such as [[milk]] and [[cheese]], are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/history/renaissance/words.html|title=International Vegetarian Union - The Origins of Some Words|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strictest forms of vegetarianism are [[veganism]] and [[fruitarianism]], which exclude all [[animal product]]s, including dairy, [[honey]], and some refined [[sugar]]s if filtered and whitened with [[bone char]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/becoming-a-vegetarian|title=Becoming a vegetarian|last=Harvard Health Publishing|date=4 December 2017|website=Harvard Health Publishing|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also partial vegetarians who do not eat meat but may eat fish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Vegetarian foods can be classified into several different types:

* Traditional foods that have always been [[vegetarian]] include [[cereal]]s, [[grain]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[vegetable]]s, [[legumes]] and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]].
* Soy products, including [[tofu]] and [[tempeh]], which are common protein sources.
* [[Textured vegetable protein]] (TVP), made from defatted soy flour, often included in chili and burger recipes in place of [[ground meat]].
* [[Meat analogue]]s, which mimic the taste, texture, and appearance of meat and are often used in [[recipe]]s that traditionally contained meat.
* Eggs and dairy product analogues in vegan cuisine (such as [[aquafaba]], [[plant cream]] or [[plant milk]]).

==Foods used in vegetarian cuisine==
[[File:Tomato soup and grilled cheese.JPG|thumb|[[Vegetable soup]] and cheese sandwich, a meal which is suitable for vegetarians but not vegans]]
Food regarded as suitable for all vegetarians (including vegans) typically includes:
* [[Cereal]]s/[[grain]]s: [[barley]], [[buckwheat]], [[Sweet corn|corn]], [[fonio]], [[hempseed]], [[maize]], [[millet]], [[oat]]s, [[quinoa]], [[rice]], [[rye]], [[sorghum]], [[triticale]], [[wheat]]; derived products such as [[flour]] ([[dough]], [[bread]], [[Baking|baked goods]], [[cornflakes]], [[dumpling]]s, [[granola]], [[Muesli]], [[pasta]] etc.).
* [[Vegetable]]s (fresh, canned, frozen, pureed, dried or [[Pickling|pickled]]); derived products such as vegetable sauces like [[chili sauce]] and [[vegetable oil]]s.
* Edible [[fungi]] (fresh, canned, dried or pickled).&lt;ref group=note&gt;Edible fungi include [[Edible mushroom|some mushrooms]] and cultured microfungi (yeasts and moulds) such as ''[[Aspergillus oryzae]]'' and ''[[Fusarium venenatum]]'', though some strict{{Clarify|date=December 2010}} Indian vegetarians do not eat mushrooms.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fruit]] (fresh, canned, frozen, pureed, candied or [[Dried fruit|dried]]); derived products such as [[jam]] and [[marmalade]].
* [[Legume]]s: [[bean]]s (including [[soybean]]s and soy products such as [[miso]], [[soy milk]], [[soy yogurt]], [[tempeh]], [[tofu]] and [[Textured vegetable protein|TVP]]), [[chickpea]]s, [[lentil]]s, [[pea]]s, [[peanut]]s; derived products such as [[peanut butter]].
* [[Nut (fruit)|Tree nuts]] and [[List of edible seeds|seeds]]; derived products such as [[nut butter]].
* [[Herb]]s, [[spice]]s and wild greens such as [[dandelion]], [[sorrel]] or [[nettle]].
* Other foods such as [[Edible seaweed|seaweed]] (however seaweed is considered inedible by some strict vegetarians for the same reason it can be considered to be non-[[kosher]] by orthodox [[Jew]]s: the possibility of tiny animals sometimes adhering to it.);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vegetarianfood1.com/?s=cuisine&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717191726/http://vegetarianfood1.com/?s=cuisine&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; derived products such as [[agar]], which has the same function as animal bone derived [[gelatin]].
* Beverages such as [[beer]],  [[coffee]], [[hot chocolate]], [[lemonade]], [[tea]] or [[wine]].
Foods not suitable for vegans, but acceptable for some other types of vegetarians:
* [[Dairy product]]s ([[butter]], [[cheese]] (except for cheese containing [[rennet]] of animal origin), [[milk]], [[yogurt]] (excluding yogurt made with [[gelatin]]) etc.) – ''not eaten by vegans and pure ovo-vegetarians''
* [[Egg (food)|Eggs]] – ''not eaten by pure vegetarians, vegans and lacto-vegetarians (most Indian vegetarians)''
* [[Honey]] – ''not eaten by most vegans''

== Cuisine that is traditionally vegetarian ==

* [[Indian cuisine]] in [[Asia]] is replete with vegetarian dishes, many of which can be traced to religious traditions (such as [[Jain]] and [[Hindu]]). [[Gujarati cuisine]] of India is predominantly vegetarian among other Indian cuisines: Gujarati [[thali]] is very famous among Indians. There are many vegetarian [[Cuisine of India|Indian foods]] such as [[pakora]], [[samosa]], [[Khichdi|khichris]], [[Pilaf|Pulao]], [[raita (condiment)|raitas]], [[rasam]], bengain bharta, [[chana masala]], some [[korma]]s, [[Sambar (dish)|sambar]], [[jalfrezi]]s, [[saag aloo]], [[sabji|subjis]] (vegetable dishes) such as bindi subji, gobi subji, Punjabi chole, aloo matar and much South Indian food such as [[dosa]]s, [[idli]]s and [[Vada (food)|vadas]]. [[Chapati]] and other wheat/maida based breads like [[naan]], [[roti]] [[paratha]]s are often stuffed with vegetarian items to make it a satisfying meal. Many Indian dishes also qualify as [[vegan]], though many others use honey or dairy.

* In [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesia]], vegetarianism is well served and represented, as there are plenty selection of vegetarian dishes and meat substitutes. Dishes such as [[gado-gado]], [[karedok]], [[ketoprak (food)|ketoprak]], [[pecel]], [[urap]], [[rujak]] and [[asinan]] are vegetarian. However, for dishes that use [[peanut sauce]], such as ''gado-gado, karedok'' or ''ketoprak'', might contains small amount of [[shrimp paste]] for flavor. Served solely, ''[[gudeg]]'' can be considered a vegetarian food, since it consists of unripe [[jackfruit]] and coconut milk. Fermented [[soy]] products, such as [[tempeh]], [[tofu]] and ''[[oncom]]'' are prevalent as meat substitutes, as the source of protein. Most of Indonesians do not practice strict vegetarianism and only consume vegetables or vegetarian dishes for their taste, preference, economic and health reasons. Nevertheless, there are small numbers of Indonesian Buddhists who practice vegetarianism for religious reason.
* [[Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] foods such as [[castella]], [[dorayaki]], [[edamame]], name kojiru, [[mochi]], [[taiyaki]], [[tempura]],  vegetable [[sushi]] and [[wagashi]]. [[Miso soup]] is made from fermented white or red soy bean paste, garnished with scallions or seaweed. Although most traditional versions are made from fish stock ([[dashi]]), it can be made with vegetable stock as well.
* [[Korean cuisine]] has some dishes that are often vegetarian. One example is [[bibimbap]], which is rice with mixed vegetables.  Sometimes this dish contains beef or other non-vegetarian ingredients. Another Korean food which is sometimes vegetarian is [[jeon (food)|jeon]], in which ingredients (most commonly vegetables and/or seafood) are coated in a flour and egg batter and then pan-fried in oil.
* [[Cuisine of the Mediterranean]] such as [[tumbet]] and many [[polenta]]s and [[tapas]] dishes.
* [[Mexico|Mexican]] foods such as [[salsa (sauce)|salsa]] and [[guacamole]] with [[Tortilla chip|chips]], [[rice]] and [[bean burrito]]s (without lard in the [[refried beans]] or [[chicken fat]] in the rice), [[huevos rancheros]], [[Burrito#Veggie burrito|veggie burrito]], many [[quesadilla]]s, bean tacos, some [[chilaquiles]] and bean-pies, [[Chili con carne#Variations|chili sin carne]], [[black turtle bean|black beans]] with rice, some [[chiles rellenos]], [[cheese]] [[enchilada]]s and vegetable [[fajita]]s.
* [[Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] foods such as most [[pasta]]s, many [[pizza]]s, [[bruschetta]], [[caponata]], [[crostini]], eggplant [[parmigiana]], [[Polenta]]  and many [[risotto]]s.
* [[Europe|Continental]] cuisine such as braised [[leek]]s with [[olive]]s and [[parsley]], [[ratatouille]], many [[quiche]]s, sauteed [[Brussels sprout]]s with mushrooms, sauteed [[Swiss chard]], [[Squash (fruit)|squash]] and vegetable-stuffed [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]].
* In Germany, Frankfurt [[green sauce]], [[Klöße]] with vegetarian sauces (e.g., [[Chanterelle]]), cheese or vegetable stuffed [[Maultaschen]], combinations of [[Quark (cheese)|quark]], spinach, potatoes and herbs provide some traditional vegetarian summer dishes. Traditionally on Fridays, southern Germany broad variety of sweet dishes may be served as a main course, such as [[Germknödel]] and [[Dampfnudel]]. Potato soup and plum cake are traditional Friday dishes in the Palatinate. [[Brenntar]] in Swabia, it is made of roasted flour, usually spelt flour or oat flour.
* Many Greek and [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]] dishes, such as [[briam]], [[dolma]]s (when made without minced meat), [[fasolada]], [[gemista]], vegetable based [[moussaka]] and [[spanakopita]].
[[File:Tolstoj's vegetarian breakfast.JPG|thumb|[[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]'s vegetarian breakfast]]
* [[Russian cuisine]] developed a significant vegetarian tradition in czarist time, based on the example of [[Leo Tolstoy]].&lt;ref name="Brang"&gt;Peter Brang. Ein unbekanntes Russland, Kulturgeschichte vegetarischer Lebensweisen von den Anfängen bis zur Gegenwart An ignored aspect of Russia. Vegetarian lifestyles from the very beginning till the present day. Böhlau Verlag, Köln 2002 {{ISBN|3-412-07902-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orthodox tradition of separating meat and vegetables and as well between specific meals for [[fasting]] and other holidays contributed to a rich variety of vegetarian dishes&lt;ref name="Brang"/&gt; in Russia and Slavic countries, such as soups (vegetable [[borscht]], [[shchi]], [[okroshka]]), [[Pierogi|pirogi]], [[blini]], [[vareniki]], [[kasha]], [[buckwheat]], fermented and pickled vegetables, etc.
* Many [[Ethiopian cuisine|Ethiopian dishes]] such as [[injeera]] or Ethiopian vegetable sauces or chillies.
* [[Middle East|Mideastern]] food such as [[falafel]], [[hummus]] (mashed chick peas), tahini (ground sesame seeds), [[mentha|minted]]-[[yogurt]]s, and [[couscous]].
** [[Egyptian cuisine]] in particular is rich in vegetarian foods. For reasons ranging from economics to the religious practices of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], most Egyptian dishes rely on beans and vegetables: the national dishes, [[kushari]] and [[ful medames]], are entirely vegetarian, as are usually the assorted vegetable casseroles that characterize the typical Egyptian meal.
* Many dishes in [[Cuisine of Thailand|Thai]] cuisine can be made vegetarian if the main protein element is substituted by a vegetarian alternative such as tofu. This includes dishes such as ''phat khi mao'' and, if a vegetarian shrimp paste and fish sauce substitute is used, many [[Thai curry|Thai curries]]. Venues serving vegetarian [[Buddhist cuisine]] (''ahan che''; {{lang-th|อาหารเจ}}) can be found all over Thailand.
* [[Creole cuisine|Creole]] and Southern foods such as hush puppies, okra patties, rice and [[bean]]s, or sauteed [[kale]] or [[collards]], if not cooked with the traditional [[pork]] [[fat]] or meat [[stock]].
* Some [[Welsh cuisine|Welsh recipes]], including [[Glamorgan sausage]]s, [[laverbread]] and [[Welsh rarebit]].
[[File:Palatschinken.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palatschinken]] with [[ice cream]], [[fruit]]s and fruit [[compote]] from [[Austria]]]]

===Desserts and sweets===
Most [[dessert]]s, including [[pie]]s, [[Cobbler (food)|cobblers]], [[cake]]s, [[chocolate brownie|brownies]], [[cookie]]s, [[Chocolate truffle|truffles]], [[Rice Krispie treat]]s (from gelatin-free [[marshmallow]]s or [[marshmallow fluff]]), [[peanut butter]] treats, [[pudding]], [[rice pudding]], [[ice cream]], [[crème brulée]], etc., are free of meat and fish and are suitable for ovo-lacto vegetarians. Eastern [[confectionery]] and desserts, such as [[halva]] and [[Turkish delight]], are mostly vegan, while others such as [[baklava]] (which often contains butter) are lacto vegetarian. Indian desserts and sweets are mostly vegetarian like [[peda]], [[barfi]], [[gulab jamun]], [[shrikhand]], [[basundi]], [[kaju katri]], [[rasgulla]], cham cham, rajbhog, etc. Indian sweets are mostly made from milk products and are thus lacto vegetarian; dry fruit-based sweets are vegan.

== Cuisine that uses meat analogues ==
[[File:Veggie burger SuziJane flickr creative commons.jpg|thumb|[[Morningstar Farms]] tomato and basil pizza veggie burgers garnished with onion, ketchup and [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]].]]
These are vegetarian versions of popular dishes that non-vegetarians enjoy and are frequently consumed as [[fast food]], [[comfort food]], transition food for new vegetarians, or a way to show non-vegetarians that they can be vegetarians while still enjoying their favorite foods. Many vegetarians just enjoy these dishes as part of a varied diet.

Some popular mock-meat dishes include:
* [[Veggie burger]]s ([[Hamburger|burgers]] usually made from grains, [[Textured vegetable protein|TVP]], [[wheat gluten (food)|seitan]] (wheat gluten), [[tempeh]] or mushrooms)
* [[Vegetarian hot dog|Veggie dogs]] (usually made from TVP)
* Imitation sausage (soysage, various types of 'salami', 'bologna', 'pepperoni', et al., made of some form of [[soy]])
* Mockmeat or 'meatyballs' (usually made from TVP)
* Vegetarian or meatless 'chicken' (usually made from seitan, [[soy|tofu]] or TVP)
* [[Jambalaya]] (with mock sausage and mock chicken, usually made from TVP, seitan, or [[tempeh]])
* Tomato omelette where tomatoes and a paste of [[flour]] are used to produce a vegetable omelette without the use of eggs.
* Scrambled eggs where [[tofu]] is mashed and fried with spices (often including [[turmeric]], for its strong yellow color) to produce a dish that strongly resembles eggs.
* When baking, eggs are easily replaced by ground flax seeds, applesauce, mashed bananas, or commercial egg replacer

[[Mycoprotein]] is another common base for mock-meats, and vegetarian flavorings are added to these bases, such as [[:Category:Sea vegetables|sea vegetables]] for a seafood taste.

== Commercial products ==
[[File:India vegetarian labels.svg|thumb|right|[[Vegetarian mark|Labeling used in India]] to distinguish vegetarian products (left) from non-vegetarian products (right).]]
Commercial products, marketed especially towards vegetarians and labeled as such, are available in most countries worldwide, in varying amounts and quality. As example, in [[Australia]], various vegetarian products are available in most of supermarket chains and a vegetarian shopping guide is provided by Vegetarian/Vegan Society of Queensland.&lt;ref name=vssg&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4491">The '''West Virginia Healthy Lifestyles Act of 2005''' is a [[West Virginia]] state law enacted in 2005. Signed into law by [[Governor of West Virginia|Governor]] [[Joe Manchin III]], the act's purpose was to address [[obesity]] in the state.&lt;ref name="rwjf"&gt;Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, "[http://www.rwjf.org/pr/product.jsp?id=38673 West Virginia Lifestyles Act of 2005 Evaluation: A Project of Information for Action: School Policies to Prevent Childhood Obesity] (February 10, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[West Virginia Legislature|state legislature]] found in 2005 that "[[obesity epidemic|obesity is a problem of epidemic proportions]]" in West Virginia.&lt;ref name="House Bill 2816"&gt;[http://wvde.state.wv.us/healthyschools/section6/HouseBill2816.htm House Bill 2816], West Virginia Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JoeManchin.jpg|thumb |160px |[[Joe Manchin]] (D), then governor of West Virginia]]

==Provisions==
Introduced as '''House Bill 2816''', the West Virginia Health Lifestyles Act consists of five school-based mandates which require health education assessments, fitness assessments, [[physical education]], [[body mass index]] (BMI) assessments and the availability of healthy beverages in schools.&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/stateprograms/fundedstates/west_virginia.html Obesity and Overweight for Professionals: State Programs: Funded States: West Virginia], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law restricts elementary schools, middle schools, and junior high schools from selling [[soft drink]]s in areas accessible to students during the school day. High schools are allowed to sell soft drinks in [[vending machine]]s during the school day only if they also offer healthy drink options as well and only if at least fifty percent of the drinks available are considered to be healthy. The law recognizes healthy drinks as water, low-fat [[milk]], [[juice]]s made one hundred percent from fruits and vegetables, and other juice drinks with a minimum of twenty percent real juice. This portion of the law states that, "Seventy-five percent of the profits from the sale of healthy beverages and soft drinks shall be allocated by a majority vote of the [[faculty senate]] of each school and twenty-five percent of the profits from the sale of healthy beverages and soft drinks shall be allocated to the purchase of necessary supplies by the principal of the school."&lt;ref name="House Bill 2816"/&gt;

In addition to the school-based mandates, the act created the Office of Healthy Lifestyles within the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, a partnership to encourage healthy lifestyles by children and families in the state, and an interest bearing account known as the Healthy Lifestyles Fund.&lt;ref name="House Bill 2816"/&gt;

==Implementation and funding==
The policy's school-based elements were implemented beginning in 2006.&lt;ref name="rwjf" /&gt; The state has received funding  to evaluate the legislation and its impact from the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]], a national philanthropy organization dedicating to improving health care in the United States.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

Carole Harris, professor of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry at the [[West Virginia University]], conducted research that evaluated the West Virginia Healthy Lifestyles Act and the [[West Virginia Board of Education]]’s school nutrition standards. Dr. Harris noted that participation by students and schools in health education and fitness testing had improved, but approximately 40 percent of schools are unable to meet one or more of the five mandates in the act: "The combination of these policies for nutrition and physical activity make West Virginia one of the most progressive states in the country when it comes to addressing childhood obesity and related issues. But some schools continue to struggle to provide the mandated physical education because of inadequate staffing, facilities, or both."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/n/2010/02/23/wvu-research-finds-healthy-lifestyles-act-and-state-nutrition-standards-help-children WVU research finds Healthy Lifestyles Act and state nutrition standards help children] (press release) (February 23, 2010).

[[Image:Aqueduto das Águas Livres 2.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The aqueduct seen from the west]]
The '''Águas Livres Aqueduct''' ({{lang-pt|Aqueduto das Águas Livres}}, {{IPA-pt|ɐkɨˈdutu dɐʃ ˈaɡwɐʃ ˈlivɾɨʃ|pron}}, "Aqueduct of the Free Waters") is a historic [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] in the city of [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]. It is one of the most remarkable examples of 18th-century Portuguese [[engineering]]. The main course of the aqueduct covers 18&amp;nbsp;km, but the whole network of canals extends through nearly 58&amp;nbsp;km.

The city of Lisbon has always suffered from the lack of [[drinking water]], and [[John V of Portugal|King John V]] decided to build an aqueduct to bring water from sources in the [[Freguesia|parish]] of [[Caneças]], in the modern municipality of [[Odivelas]]. The project was paid for by a special [[sales tax]] on [[beef]], [[olive oil]], [[wine]], and other products.

==History==
Construction started in 1731 under the direction of [[Architecture of Italy|Italian architect]] [[Antonio Canevari]], replaced in 1732 by a group of Portuguese architects and engineers, including [[Manuel da Maia]], Azevedo Fortes and [[José da Silva Pais]]. Between 1733 and 1736, the project was directed by Manuel da Maia, who in turn was replaced by Custódio Vieira, who would remain at the head of the project until around 1747. 

Custódio Vieira conceived the centerpiece of the aqueduct, the arches over the Alcantara valley, completed in 1744. A total of 35 arches cross the valley, covering 941 m. The tallest arches reach a height of 65 m, and many are pointed, reminiscent of arches in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. It is considered a masterpiece of engineering in the [[Baroque]] period.

In 1748, although the project was still unfinished, the aqueduct finally started to bring water to the city of Lisbon, a fact celebrated in a commemorative arch built in the Amoreiras neighbourhood. From this period on, construction was overseen by other architects, including [[Carlos Mardel]] of [[Hungary]] and others. During the reigns of [[José I of Portugal|José I]] and [[Maria I of Portugal|Maria I]], the network of [[canal]]s and [[fountain]]s was greatly enlarged. 

On November 1st, 1755, the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] hit the city, but the brand new aqueduct managed to remain intact.

It is possible to visit and cross the aqueduct, starting at the ''Museu da Água'' (Water Museum).

==Mãe d'Água==
The ''Mãe d'Água'' (Mother of the Water) [[reservoir]] of the Amoreiras, the largest of the water reservoirs, was finished in 1834. This reservoir, with a capacity of 5,500 m³ of water, was designed by [[Carlos Mardel]]. It is now deactivated and can be visited as part of the ''Museu da Água'' (Water Museum).
