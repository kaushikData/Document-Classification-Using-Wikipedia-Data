It is spoken mostly by the [[Abkhaz people]]. It is one of the official languages of [[Abkhazia]]{{efn|name=Abkhazia-note}}, where around 100,000 people speak it.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; Furthermore, it is spoken by thousands of members of the Abkhazian diaspora in [[Turkey]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]'s autonomous republic of [[Adjara]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]] and several Western countries. The Russian census of 2010 reported 6,786 speakers of Abkhazian in [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="RC2010" /&gt;

== Classification ==
Abkhaz is a [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian language]] and is therefore related to [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]]. It is especially close to [[Abaza language|Abaza]], and they are sometimes considered dialects of the same language, [[Abazgi]], of which the literary dialects of Abkhaz and Abaza are simply two ends of a [[dialect continuum]]. Grammatically, the two are very similar; however, the differences in phonology are substantial and are the main reason for many other linguists preferring to keep the two separate. Most linguists (instance, Chirikba 2003) believe that [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]] is the closest relative to the Abkhaz–Abaza dialect continuum.

== Geographical distribution ==
Abkhaz is spoken primarily in [[Abkhazia]]. Abkhaz is also spoken by members of the large Abkhaz [[Ethnic cleansing of Circassians|Muhajir diaspora]], mainly located in [[Turkey]], with smaller groups living in [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], and [[Jordan]]; the Georgian autonomous republic of [[Adjara]]; throughout the [[former Soviet Union]] (e.g. [[Armenia]] and [[Ukraine]]); and – through more recent emigration – in Western countries such as [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United States]]. However, the exact number of Abkhaz speakers in these countries remains unknown due to a lack of official records.

== History ==
The earliest extant written records of the Abkhaz language are in the [[Arabic script]], recorded by the Turkish traveller [[Evliya Çelebi]] in the 17th century. Abkhaz has been used as a literary language for only about 100 years.

== Dialects ==
Abkhaz is generally viewed as having three major dialects:
* '''Abzhywa''', spoken in the Caucasus, and named after the historical area of [[Abzhywa]] (Абжьыуа), sometimes referred to as '''Abzhui''', the [[Russian language|Russified]] form of the name (''Abzhuiski dialekt'', derived from the Russian form of the name for the area, {{lang|ru|Абжуа}}).
* '''[[Bzyb dialect|Bzyb]]''' or Bzyp, spoken in the Caucasus and in Turkey, and named after the [[Bzyb (region)|Bzyb]] ({{lang-ab|Бзыԥ|links=no}}) area.
* '''Sadz''', nowadays spoken only in Turkey, formerly also spoken between the rivers [[Bzyb River|Bzyp]] and Khosta.
The [[literary language]] is based on the Abzhywa dialect.

== Phonology ==
{{main|Abkhaz phonology}}

Abkhaz has a very large number of consonants (58 in the literary dialect), with three-way [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]/[[voicelessness|voiceless]]/[[ejective consonant|ejective]] and [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]/[[labialization|labialized]]/plain distinctions. By contrast, the language has only two phonemically distinct vowels—which, however, have several [[allophone]]s depending on the palatal and/or [[labial consonant|labial]] quality of adjacent consonants.

Phonemes in &lt;span style="color:#008000;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; are found in the Bzyp and Sadz dialects of Abkhaz, but not in Abzhywa; phonemes in &lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; are unique to the Bzyp dialect.

== Grammar ==
Abkhaz is typologically classified as a [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] and [[agglutinative]] language. Like all other Northwest Caucasian languages, Abkhaz has an extremely complex verbal system coupled with a very simple noun system. [[Viacheslav Chirikba]] has characterized Abkhaz as a "verbcentric language", as the verb occupies the central place in Abkhaz morphology.

Abkhaz is an [[ergative–absolutive language]] that distinguishes just two cases, the [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] and the [[adverbial case|adverbial]].

== Writing system ==
{{Main|Abkhaz alphabet}}

Abkhaz has used the [[Cyrillic script]] since 1862. The first alphabet was a 37-character [[Cyrillic]] alphabet invented by Baron [[Peter von Uslar]]. In 1909 a 55-letter Cyrillic alphabet was used. A 75-letter Latin script devised by a Russian/Georgian linguist [[Nikolai Marr]] lasted for 2 years 1926–1928 (during the [[Latinisation in the Soviet Union|Latinization campaign]]). The [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian script]] was adopted and used in 1938–54 years after was restored the initial [[Cyrillic]] alphabet designed in 1892 by [[Dmitry Gulia]] together with Konstantin Machavariani and modified in 1909 by Aleksey Chochua.

== Status ==
Both Georgian and Abkhaz law enshrines an official status of the Abkhaz language in Abkhazia.

The 1992 law of Georgia, reiterated in the 1995 [[Constitution of Georgia (country)|constitution]], grants Abkhaz the status of second official language in the territory of Abkhazia — along with [[Georgian language|Georgian]].

In November 2007, the de facto authorities of Abkhazia adopted a new law "on the state language of the Republic of Abkhazia" that mandates Abkhaz as the language of official communication. According to the law, all meetings held by the president, parliament, and government must be conducted in Abkhaz (instead of Russian, which is currently a de facto administrative language) from 2010, and all state officials will be obliged to use Abkhaz as their language of everyday business from 2015. Some, however, have considered the implementation of this law unrealistic and concerns have been made that it will drive people away from Abkhazia and hurt the independent press due to a significant share of non-Abkhaz speakers among ethnic minorities as well as Abkhaz themselves, and a shortage of teachers of Abkhaz. The law is an attempt to amend a situation where up to a third of the ethnic Abkhaz population are no longer capable of speaking their ethnic language, and even more are unable to read or write it; instead, Russian is the language most commonly used in public life at present.&lt;ref&gt;Anahid Gogorian (December 20, 2007), [http://iwpr.net/?p=crs&amp;s=f&amp;o=341580&amp;apc_state=henpcrs Abkhaz Worried by Language Law.] [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]] Caucasus Reporting Service No. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Labialization|labialized]] [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] consonants шъу {{ipa|[ʂʷ]}} and жъу {{ipa|[ʐʷ]}} in the literary Temirgoy dialect are [[Alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] щу {{ipa|[ɕʷ]}} and жьу {{ipa|[ʑʷ]}} in the Black Sea coast dialects of Adyghe ([[Shapsug Adyghe dialect|Shapsug dialect]] and [[Natukhai#Language|Natukhai dialect]]).
* In the Black Sea coast dialects of Adyghe (e.g. [[Shapsug Adyghe dialect|Shapsug dialect]] and [[Natukhai#Language|Natukhai dialect]]) there exists an [[alveolar ejective fricative]] {{IPAblink|sʼ}} that correspond to {{IPAblink|t͡sʼ}} in other Adyghe dialects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150713055635/http://adygeya-republic.info/adyghe-language/detalno/foneticheskie-izmenenija-soglasnykh/spirantizacija-affrikat/ Спирантизация аффрикат] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Shapsug words "сӏэ" {{ipa|[sʼa]}} "name" and "псӏы" {{ipa|[psʼə]}} "lie" are pronounced in other dialects as "цӏэ" {{ipa|[t͡sʼa]}} and пцӏы {{ipa|[pt͡sʼə]}}.
* The phoneme written ''Л л'' is pronounced as a [[voiced alveolar lateral fricative]] {{IPAblink|ɮ}} mostly by the Circassians of [[Adygea]], but many Circassians in diaspora pronounce it as an [[alveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPAblink|l}}.
* In Adyghe, the [[Palato-alveolar consonant|palato-alveolar]] consonants ш {{IPAblink|ʃ}}, шӏ {{IPAblink|ʃʼ}} and шӏу {{IPA|[ʃʷʼ]}} may be [[Affricate consonant|affricated]] to ч {{IPAblink|t͡ʃ}}, чӏ {{IPAblink|ʈ͡ʂʼ}} and чӏу {{IPA|[ʈ͡ʂʷʼ]}} after the consonant с {{IPA|[s]}} or шъу {{IPA|[ʃʷ]}}. For example, the words:
:сщагъ "I carried him to" → счагъ [sət͡ʃaːʁ]
:сшӏагъ "I knew": → счӏагъ [sət͡ʂʼaːʁ]
:сшӏэрэп "I don't know": → счӏэрэп [sət͡ʂʼarap]
:сшӏошӏыгъ "I thought" → счӏошӏыгъ [sət͡ʂʷʼaʃʼəʁ]
:шъушӏагъ "you (pl.) knew" → шъучӏагъ [ʃʷt͡ʂʼaːʁ].
* The first and second person prefixes с {{IPAblink|s}}, т {{IPAblink|t}}, п {{IPAblink|p}} and шъу {{IPA|[ʃʷ]}} may become voiced з {{IPAblink|z}}, д {{IPAblink|d}}, б {{IPAblink|b}} and жъу {{IPA|[ʒʷ]}} before the consonant гъ {{IPAblink|ʁ}}. For example:
:сгъэкӏуагъ "I made him go" → згъэкӏуагъ [zʁakʷʼaːʁ]
:тгъэкӏуагъ "we made him go" → дгъэкӏуагъ [dʁakʷʼaːʁ]
:пгъэкӏуагъ "you made him go" → бгъэкӏуагъ [bʁakʷʼaːʁ]
:шъугъэкӏуагъ "you (pl.) made him go" → жъугъэкӏуагъ [ʒʷʁakʷʼaːʁ].
* The phoneme {{IPAblink|f}} {{angle bracket|ф}} found in the Adyghe dialects correspond to [xʷ] {{angle bracket|ху}} in [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]]. For example:
:тфы [tfə] "five" ↔ тху [txʷə]
:фыжьы [fəʑə] "white" ↔ хужь [xʷəʑ]
:цӏыфы [t͡sʼəfə] "person" ↔ цӏыху [t͡sʼəxʷ].
* In many Adyghe dialects (e.g. Bzhedug, Shapsug, Natukhia and Abzakh) there exists [t͡ɕʷ] {{angle bracket|чъу}} that corresponds to standard Temirgoy [t͡sʷ] {{angle bracket|цу}}. For example, the Temirgoy word цуакъэ [t͡sʷaːqa] is чъуакъэ [t͡ɕʷaːqa] in the other Adyghe dialects.
* All dialects possess a contrast between plain and labialized [[glottal stop]]s. A very unusual minimal contrast, and possibly unique to the [[Abzakh Adyghe dialect|Abzakh dialect]] of Adyghe, is a three-way contrast between plain, [[labialized]] and [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] [[glottal stop]]s.
* The [[Black Sea]] dialect of Adyghe contains a very uncommon sound: a [[bidental consonant|bidental]] [[voiceless bidental fricative|fricative {{IPA|[h̪͆]}}]], which corresponds to the [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}} found in other varieties of Adyghe.
* The [[Hakuchi Adyghe dialect|Hakuchi]] dialect of Adyghe contains [[uvular ejective]] [qʼ] and a labialized uvular ejective [qʷʼ], which corresponds to the [ʔ] and [ʔʷ] in other dialects.

==Vowels==

In contrast to its large consonant inventory, Adyghe has only three phonemic vowels in a classic [[vertical vowel system]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1179">'''Ali Taramakhi''' or '''Elî Teremaxî''', was a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] linguist and writer in the 16th century. He is credited for writing the first [[Arabic grammar]] book in the [[Kurdish language]] in 1591.  His book is titled, ''Serfa Kurmancî'' or ''Tesrîf''. He wrote the book in order to allow Kurdish pupils  to learn and study Arabic more easily.  This work was later expanded by Male Younis Halkataini (died 1785). The book has 33 chapters covering different aspects of the Arabic [[grammar]].

{{for|the magazine|Armchair General (magazine)}}

The term "'''armchair general'''" has two meanings. It is conventionally used as a derogatory term for a person who regards himself as an expert on military matters, despite having little to no actual experience in the military. Alternatively, it can mean a military commander who doesn't participate in actual combat.

== Conventional usage ==
The most common usage of the term refers to "[a] person without military experience who regards himself as an expert military strategist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/armchair_general|title=Oxford Living Dictionaries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This person may be a civilian whose only exposure to the military or [[military history]] is through academic or self-study, or a former member of the military, who was of low rank and/or has no experience with planning or strategic decision-making.  In both cases, these individuals claim to be more capable of analyzing combat conditions and making strategic judgments than past military commanders who have been responsible for such analysis and decisions (''see also'' [[Armchair theorizing]]'').

=== Examples of usage ===
In 1967, ''[[New York Times]]'' correspondent [[Max Frankel]] wrote, "In most wars, the armchairs are full of generals re-fighting every battle."{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

== Alternate usage ==
The term is also used to describe "a military commander who is not actively involved in warfare, or who directs troops from a position of comfort or safety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/armchair_general|title=Oxford Living Dictionaries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These officers' duties are described by the media and the rest of the military as more bureaucratic than functional, and who have little to no experience in combat or [[warfare]], yet hold a great degree of authority over soldiers or commanders who do.

The term is not exclusively applied to officers of command rank (such as [[General (military)|general]]s or [[Admiral]]s); it is also a popular term among enlisted personnel and the media to describe high-ranking officers whose rank affords them superior privileges, especially when they have attained rank through higher education, or the influence of their families, rather than combat duty.

=== Origin ===
*[[Carl von Clausewitz]] alluded to "someone following operations from an armchair".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Examples ===
* Many of the generals of [[World War I]] had experience in combat, but only from the days before [[trench warfare]] became widespread. Because of this, officers lacked the experience that in the past had made it viable to command troops from a distance.
*[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], after enlisting in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in 1911, was assigned to the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]] and graduated in 1928. He never served in combat, even during World War I, and held mostly administrative positions afterwards. During [[World War II]], he was appointed [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force]], in spite of never having been in combat.
*[[George Marshall]] was described as the "organizer of victory" by [[Winston Churchill]], for his outstanding logistical and administrative skills. Like Eisenhower, he rose to general's rank despite having never led troops in combat.
*The United States' [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] are often regarded by the media as tedious bureaucrats, since their duties are largely administrative and political; those of them who have actually served in combat may have done so years, or decades, before attaining their high rank, and so this experience is seen as of little relevance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6945">'''Asa'pili''' is a [[constructed language]] created by the pseudonymous author [[P.M._(author)|P.M.]] in his book [[Bolo'bolo]]. On the one hand, it is an [[artistic language]], intended to explain his concepts for a sustainable future in an original way. On the other hand, it is a neutral [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary language]] intended for use in the quasi-utopian ''bolo''-based global community which he describes in the book.  Asa'pili is not a full language, but a basic vocabulary of about thirty words, which can be used to refer to cultural institutions and concepts.

The complete list of the basic words is as follows:

||[[File:Bologlyph-ibu.svg|30px|center|Symbol of ''ibu'']]||align="center"|ibu||"individual, person"

All these terms (except ''munu'') are accompanied by corresponding abstract glyphs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyber-eclat.net/lyber/bolo/asapili.html Lyber-eclat.net]&lt;/ref&gt; so that the concepts can be represented visually independently of any specific writing system.  These words can be combined into modifier-modified compounds (with the two elements separated by an apostrophe), so that ''asa'pili'' means "world language", ''fasi'ibu'' means "traveler", ''vudo'dala'' means "county-level assembly", etc.  Doubling a noun changes it into a collective or abstract noun, so that ''bolo'bolo'' means "all ''bolo''s, the system of ''bolo''s".

'''Audrey Bettie Blignault''' (July 6, 1916 &amp;ndash; October 1, 2008) was a [[South Africa]]n writer.
==Life ==
The daughter of an Irish mother and an [[Afrikaner]] father who was the town's mayor, she was born '''Audrey Bettie Swart''' in [[Bredasdorp]]. She studied [[Afrikaans literature]] at [[Stellenbosch University]], receiving an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Afrikaans and Dutch. In 1940, she began teaching at [[Wellington, Western Cape|Wellington]] and then later at [[Stellenbosch]]. In 1945, she became the editor of ''Die Huisvrou'', a women's magazine.

'''Chiripá Guarani''' (Tsiripá, Txiripá), also known as '''Ava Guarani''' and '''''Nhandéva''' (Ñandeva)'', is a [[Guaraní languages|Guaraní]] language spoken in [[Paraguay]], [[Brazil]], and also [[Argentina]]. It is closely related to [[Paraguayan Guaraní]], a language which speakers are increasingly switching to. There are 4,900 speakers in Brazil and 7,000 in Paraguay.

Nhandéva is also known as Chiripá. The Spanish spelling, Ñandeva, is used in the Paraguayan Chaco to refer to the local variety of [[Eastern Bolivian Guaraní|Eastern Bolivian]], a subdialect of Avá. 

Chiripá is one of a number of "[[Guaraní dialects]]" often classified as distinct languages. Of these, Paraguayan Guaraní is by far the largest variety and it is often referred to simply as Guaraní.

The '''Bath curse tablets''' are a collection of about 130 [[Roman Britain|Roman]] era [[curse tablets]] (or ''defixiones'' in [[Latin]]) discovered in 1979/1980 in the English city of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. The tablets invoke the intercession of the goddess [[Sulis|Sulis Minerva]] in the return of stolen goods and to curse the perpetrators of the thefts.  Inscribed mostly in [[British Latin]], they have been used to attest to the everyday spoken vernacular of the [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] population of the second to fourth centuries A.D.

==Discovery and description==
[[File:Roman Baths in Bath Spa, England - July 2006.jpg|alt=Photograph of the Baths showing a rectangular area of greenish water surrounded by yellow stone buildings with pillars. In the background is the tower of the abbey.|thumb|right|The Roman baths at Bath&amp;nbsp;— the entire structure above the level of the pillar bases is post-Roman.]]
The [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Roman baths]] and temple dedicated to the goddess [[Sulis|Sulis Minerva]] in the English city of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] (founded by the Romans as ''[[Aquae Sulis]]'') were excavated between 1978 and 1983 by a team led by [[Barry Cunliffe]] and Peter Davenport.&lt;ref name= CA&gt;{{cite journal |year=2008|title=The end of Roman Bath |journal=Current Archaeology  |issue=217|pages= |url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/features/the-end-of-roman-bath.htm |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979/1980, around 130 tablets were discovered in an excavation of the "Sacred Spring" under the King's Bath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Magical Practice in the Latin West |last=Gordon |first=Richard |author2=Simon, Francisco Marco |year=2010 |isbn=9789004179042 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spring had been temporarily diverted to facilitate the excavation, revealing a huge array of [[Roman Britain|Roman era]] items including the tablets.&lt;ref name= Wilson&gt;{{cite book |title=A guide to the Roman remains in Britain|last=Wilson |first=Roger  |year=1988 |isbn=0094686807 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tablets, some in a fragmentary state,&lt;ref name= Adams&gt; {{cite journal |author=J.N. Adams |year=1992 |title=British Latin: the text, interpretation and language of the Bath Curse Tablets |journal=Britannia|volume=23 |page=1|doi=10.2307/526102}}&lt;/ref&gt; were small and rectangular and initially were assumed to be made of lead, although subsequent metallurgical analysis revealed that they are, in fact, made of lead alloyed with tin, with occasional traces of copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Ancient Greece and Rome Vol.2  |last=Flint |first=Valerie |year=1998 |isbn=0485891026|page=11|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the tablets were cast under pressure into thin, flexible sheets with a finish as smooth as paper whereas others appear to have been roughly hammered out from a molten lump.&lt;ref name= Tomlin2011&gt;Tomlin, Roger "Writing and Communication", p.152 in {{cite book |title=Artefacts in Roman Britain: Their Purpose and Use |last=Allason-Jones |first=Lindsay (ed.) |year=2011 |isbn=0521860121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the tablets were inscribed, either with [[Roman square capitals|Roman capitals]] or with [[Roman cursive|cursive script]], but the expertise of the lettering varied.&lt;ref name= Tomlin2011/&gt; Some of the tablets had markings that appear to be an illiterate imitation of lettering, for example repetitive lines of crosses or sevens, and some were completely blank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Ancient Greece and Rome Vol.2  |last=Flint |first=Valerie |year=1998 |isbn=0485891026|page=60|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tablets were put on display in the Roman Baths Museum in Bath, where they continue to be available to be viewed by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findmylibrary.co.uk/CollectionDetails/2288410 |title=Archaeology Collection – Roman Baths Museum: Bath &amp; North East Somerset Heritage Services Division|publisher=Find My Library |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions on the tablets were published in full in 1988 by historian Roger Tomlin.&lt;ref name= Adams2008&gt;{{cite book |title=The Regional Diversification of Latin 200 BC – AD 600 |last=Adams |first=James N.|year=2008 |isbn=978-0521881494 |pages=579–580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscriptions==
The tablets were identified as “[[curse tablets]]” dating from the second to fourth centuries A.D.&lt;ref name= Adams/&gt; Curse tablets are small metal sheets inscribed with curses against specific people and were used in popular magic throughout the [[Roman Empire|Roman world]].&lt;ref name= Herman&gt;{{cite book |title=Vulgar Latin  |last=Herman  |first=Jozsef |year=2000|origyear=1967 |isbn=0271020016 |pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Language===
Most of the inscriptions are in colloquial Latin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Romano-Celtic Elites and their Religion  |last=Adams |first=Geoffrey |year=2005 |isbn=0975844512 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically in the [[Vulgar Latin]] of the [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] population, known as "[[British Latin]]".&lt;ref name= Adams/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cross Goes North: Processes of Conversion in Northern Europe, AD 300–1300 |last=Carver  |first=Martin |year=2006 |isbn=1843831252 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the inscriptions are in a language which is not Latin, although they use Roman lettering, and may be in a British [[Celtic language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=R.S.O Tomlin |year=1987 |title=Was Ancient British Celtic ever a written language? Two texts from Roman Bath |journal=Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies |volume=34 |pages=18–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this should be the case, they would be the only examples of a written ancient British Celtic language; however, there is not yet scholarly consensus on their decipherment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia  |last=Koch  |first=John T. |year=2006 |isbn=1851094407 |page=970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content===
All but one of the 130 Bath curse tablets concern the restitution of stolen goods and are a type of curse tablet known as "prayers for justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Ancient Greece and Rome Vol.2  |last=Flint |first=Valerie |year=1998 |isbn=0485891026|pages=37–38|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complained of thefts are generally of personal possessions from the baths such as jewellery, gemstones, money, household goods and especially clothing.&lt;ref name= Gager193&gt;{{cite book |title= Curse tablets and binding spells from the ancient world|last=Gager |first=John G.  |year=1999 |isbn=0195134826|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theft from public baths appears to have been a common problem as it was a well-known Roman literary stereotype and severe laws existed to punish the perpetrators.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite book |title= Curse tablets and binding spells from the ancient world|last=Gager |first=John G.  |year=1999 |isbn=0195134826|page=193 note 73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the depositors of the tablets (the victims of the thefts) appear to have been from the lower social classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tabellae Sulis: Roman inscribed tablets of tin and lead from the sacred spring at Bath |last=Tomlin |first=Roger |year=1988 |isbn=0947816003 |pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The inscriptions generally follow the same formula, suggesting it was taken from a handbook: the stolen property is declared as having been transferred to a deity so that the loss becomes the deity’s loss; the suspect is named and, in 21 cases, so is the victim; the victim then asks the deity to visit afflictions on the thief (including death) not as a punishment but to induce the thief to hand the stolen items back.&lt;ref name= Gager193/&gt; The deity whose help was invoked is Sulis, and the tablets were deposited by the victims in the spring that was sacred to her.&lt;ref name= Wilson/&gt;

===Examples===
[[Image:Sulis Minerva head Bath.jpg|thumb|right|Gilt bronze head of Sulis Minerva, to whom the curse tablets were addressed, found at her temple in Bath.]]
A typical example reads:
::"Solinus to the goddess Sulis Minerva. I give to your divinity and majesty [my] bathing tunic and cloak. Do not allow sleep or health to him who has done me wrong, whether man or woman or whether slave or free unless he reveals himself and brings those goods to your temple."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bathing in Public in the Roman World |last=Fagan |first=Garrett G. |year=2002 |isbn=0472088653 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Kropp |title= Defixiones: Ein aktuelles Corpus lateinischer Fluchtafeln |location=Speyer |date=2008 |id=03-02-24}} [http://db.edcs.eu/epigr/epi_en.php EDCS-ID]: EDCS-17900027.&lt;/ref&gt;
The formula "whether man or woman or whether slave or free" is typical, and the following example is unusual in two respects.&lt;ref name= Gager195&gt;{{cite book |title= Curse tablets and binding spells from the ancient world|last=Gager |first=John G.  |year=1999 |isbn=0195134826|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly it adds the words "whether pagan or Christian" and secondly the text was written in reversed lettering:
::"Whether pagan or Christian, whether man or woman, whether boy or girl, whether slave or free whoever has stolen from me, Annianus [son of] Matutina (?), six silver coins from my purse, you, Lady Goddess, are to exact [them] from him. If through some deceit he has given me...and do not give thus to him but reckon as (?) the blood of him who has invoked his upon me."&lt;ref name= Gager195/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{AE|1982|00667}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many name the suspected thieves:
::"I have given to the goddess Sulis the six silver coins which I have lost. It is for the goddess to exact [them] from the names written below: Senicianus and Saturninus and Anniola."&lt;ref name= Gager194&gt;{{cite book |title= Curse tablets and binding spells from the ancient world|last=Gager |first=John G.  |year=1999 |isbn=0195134826|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{AE|1982|00658}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the inscriptions are very specific in the afflictions requested and reveal the intensity of the victim's anger:&lt;ref name= ED&gt;{{cite book |title=Leisure, Pleasure and Healing: Spa Culture and Medicine in Ancient Eastern Mediterranean |last=Dvorjetski |first=Estee  |year=2007 |isbn=978-9004156814 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::"Docimedis has lost two gloves and asks that the thief responsible should lose their minds [''sic''] and eyes in the goddess' temple."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tabellae Sulis: Roman inscribed tablets of tin and lead from the sacred spring at Bath |last=Tomlin |first=Roger |year=1988 |isbn=0947816003 |pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{AE|1986|00465}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::"May he who carried off Vilbia from me become liquid as the water. May she who so obscenely devoured her become dumb"&lt;ref name= ED/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{AE|2006|00704}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::"...so long as someone, whether slave or free, keeps silent or knows anything about it, he may be accursed in (his) blood, and eyes and every limb and even have all (his) intestines quite eaten away if he has stolen the ring or been privy (to the theft)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Magic in the Ancient Greek World |last=Collins |first=Derek |year=2008|isbn=9781405132381 |pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{AE|1983|00633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One  of the suspected British Celtic inscriptions has been translated as:
::"The affixed&amp;nbsp;– Deuina, Deieda, Andagin, (and) Uindiorix&amp;nbsp;– I have bound"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mees |first=Bernard |title=Celtic Curses |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer |year=2009 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An alternative translation of the above inscription is:
::"May I, Windiorix for/at Cuamena defeat (alt. ''summon to justice'') the worthless woman, oh divine Deieda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sims-Williams |first=Patrick |title="Common Celtic, Gallo-Brittonic, and Insular Celtic" in Gauloise et celtique continental, P-Y Lambert, G-J Pinault, eds. |publisher=Droz |year=2007 |page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Buddhadeb Dasgupta was born in a Vaidya family in 1944 in [[Anara, Purulia|Anara]] near [[Puruliya]] in Southern [[West Bengal]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calcuttaweb.com/cinema/buddhadebdasgupta.shtml Buddhadeb Dasgupta Profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207155513/http://www.calcuttaweb.com/cinema/buddhadebdasgupta.shtml |date=7 December 2007 }} at Calcuttaweb.com.&lt;/ref&gt; and was third of nine siblings. His father Tarkanta Dasgupta was a doctor with the [[Indian Railway]], thus he spent early part of childhood travelling. It was only at the age of twelve that he was sent to Calcutta to study at Dinabandhu School, [[Howrah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ho|Hood, p. 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; Post-independence his father was transferred first to [[Kharagpur]] in [[West Midnapore district]] and to [[Manendragarh]] (now in [[Chhattisgarh]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ho|Hood, p. 3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied economics at the prestigious [[Scottish Church College]] and at the [[University of Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;''Some Alumni of Scottish Church College'' in ''175th Year Commemoration Volume''. Scottish Church College, April 2008, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Aami, Tumi, O Scottish'' (translated from Bengali:"Me, You, and Scottish") in ''175th Year Commemoration Volume''. Scottish Church College, April 2008, p. 430-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Buddhadeb started his career as an economics teacher, at the [[Shyamsundar College]] of the [[University of Burdwan]] followed by [[City College, Calcutta]]. In 1976, when disenchanted by the gap he perceived between the economic theory he taught and the socio-political reality, he took to film making.&lt;ref name=tr/&gt; Meanwhile, his membership with the [[Calcutta Film Society]], where he first started going in his senior high school along with his uncle, exposed him to the works of directors like [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Vittorio De Sica]], [[Roberto Rossellini]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]. This, in turn, inspired him take film making as a mode of expression.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ho|Hood, p. 14]]&lt;/ref&gt; He started his film career with a 10-minute documentary in 1968, ''The Continent of Love''; eventually he made his first full-length feature film, ''[[Dooratwa]]'' (Distance) in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Syed|first=M.H. |title=Encyclopaedia of Modern Journalism and Mass Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G49qfMZZqbEC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=%22Buddhadeb+Dasgupta%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;lr=&amp;cd=12#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Buddhadeb%20Dasgupta%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=Anmol Publications|isbn=81-261-2420-2|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His lyricism has been extended to cinema as well. During the early stages of his film career, Dasgupta made films inspired by [[Satyajit Ray]]'s realistic films and later moved on to other forms. Some of his most acclaimed films are ''Bagh Bahadur'', ''Tahader Katha'', ''Charachar'' and ''Uttara''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upperstall.com/people/buddhadeb-dasgupta  Buddhadeb Dasgupta] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201030928/http://www.upperstall.com/people/buddhadeb-dasgupta |date=1 December 2010 }} ''[[Upperstall.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chakma language''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɑː|k|m|ə|}}; autonym: {{lang|ccp|𑄌𑄋𑄴𑄟𑄳𑄦 𑄞𑄌𑄴}}, {{lang|ccp|Changma Vai|script=Latn}}) is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language spoken by the [[Chakma people|Chakma]] and [[Daingnet people]]. Its better-known closest relatives are [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Hajong language|Hajong]], Bengali,  [[Chittagonian language|Chittagonian]], and [[Bishnupriya Manipuri]] of Manipur, [[Tanchangya language|Tanchangya]], and [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]]. It is spoken by nearly 310,000 people in southeast Bangladesh in [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]], and another 300,000 in [[India]] in [[Assam]] and [[Tripura]] and 40,265 in Mizoram. It is written using the [[Chakma script]], which is also called ''Ajhā pāṭh'', sometimes romanised ''Ojhopath''. Literacy in Chakma script is low.

It is officially recognised by neither the Bangladesh government nor the Indian government, the only two countries where local [[Chakma people]] live.

Although there were no Chakma language radio or television stations as of 2011, the language has a presence in social media and on YouTube. The Hill Education Chakma Script website provides tutorials, videos, e-books, and Chakma language forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Languages: Online Activism To Save Chakma Language| work = Rising Voices| accessdate = 2 September 2012
| date = 29 November 2011| url = http://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/blog/2011/11/29/languages-online-activism-to-save-chakma-language/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Government of Tripura announced it would "introduce Chakma language in Chakma script in primary schools of [[Tripura]]. Imparting of education up to elementary stage in mother tongue is a national policy. To begin with Chakma language subjects in its own scripts will be introduced in 58 primary schools in Chakma concentrated areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Hueiyen News Service / Newmai News Network| title = Chakma script to be introduced in Tripura| work = E-Pao!

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In preparation for the January 2014 education season, the national curriculum and textbook board has already started printing books in six languages ... Chakma, Kokborok (Tripura community), [[Arakanese language|Marma]], [[Santali language|Santal]], [[Sadri language|Sadri]] (Orao community) and [[Garo language|Achik]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Chowdhury

''[[Mor Thengari]]'' (My Bicycle) was Bangladesh's first Chakma-language movie. However, it was banned in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;https://globalvoices.org/2015/12/11/bangladeshs-censor-board-blocks-the-countrys-first-chakma-language-film/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval Chakma==
The [[Chakma people|Chakma]] and [[Daingnet people]] now speak what may be considered divergent dialects of Magadhi Prakrit. However, this is due to [[language shift]] from an Oxomiya language; that medieval language may have been related to [[Sak language|Sak]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Christopher I. |date=2002 |title=Medieval Oxomiya Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HyX-Nug1rD8C |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-12424-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Chairel language|Chairel]].&lt;ref&gt;Voegelin, Charles Frederick &amp; Florence Marie Robinett Voegelin. 1977.

The '''Collatz conjecture''' is a [[conjecture]] in [[mathematics]] that concerns a [[sequence]] defined as follows: start with any [[positive integer]] ''n''. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.  The conjecture is that no matter what value of ''n'', the sequence will always reach 1.

==Statement of the problem==
[[File:Collatz-stopping-time.svg|thumb|Numbers from 1 to 9999 and their corresponding total stopping time]]
[[File:CollatzStatistic100million.png|thumb|Histogram of total stopping times for the numbers 1 to 100&amp;nbsp;million. Total stopping time is on the ''x'' axis, frequency on the ''y'' axis. Note that for all positive integers the histogram would be a completely different, exponentially-growing sequence (see [[#In reverse]])]]
[[File:Collatz-10Million.png|thumb|Iteration time for inputs of 2 to 10,000,000]]

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary [[positive integer]]:

* If the number is even, divide it by two.
* If the number is odd, triple it and add one.

In [[modular arithmetic]] notation, define the [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; f(n) = \begin{cases} n/2 &amp;\text{if } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}\\ 3n+1 &amp; \text{if } n\equiv 1 \pmod{2} .\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Now form a sequence by performing this operation repeatedly, beginning with any positive integer, and taking the result at each step as the input at the next.

In notation:

: &lt;math&gt; a_i = \begin{cases}n &amp; \text{for } i = 0 \\ f(a_{i-1}) &amp; \text{for } i &gt; 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

(that is: &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; is the value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; applied to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; recursively &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; times;  &lt;math&gt;a_i = f^i(n)&lt;/math&gt;).

The Collatz conjecture is: ''This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially.''

That smallest ''i'' such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 is called the '''total stopping time''' of ''n''.&lt;ref name="Lagarias (1985)"/&gt;  The conjecture asserts that every ''n'' has a well-defined total stopping time. If, for some ''n'', such an ''i'' doesn't exist, we say that ''n'' has infinite total stopping time and the conjecture is false.

If the conjecture is false, it can only be because there is some starting number which gives rise to a sequence that does not contain 1. Such a sequence might enter a repeating cycle that excludes 1, or increase without bound.  No such sequence has been found.

==Examples==
For instance, starting with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12, one gets the sequence 12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;19, for example, takes longer to reach 1: 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

&lt;!-- NOTICE TO EDITORS...  Please note that the number of steps is one less than the number of elements of the sequence!  So the number of 111 steps is CORRECT for n=27.  Thanks for paying attention to this factoid! --&gt;
The sequence for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;27, listed and graphed below, takes 111 steps (41 steps through odd numbers, in large font), climbing to &lt;span style="color:#FF0000"&gt; 9232&lt;/span&gt; before descending to 1.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Cycles==
Any counterexample to the Collatz conjecture would have to consist either of an infinite divergent trajectory or a cycle different from the trivial (4; 2; 1) cycle. Thus, if one could prove that neither of these types of counterexample could exist, then all positive integers would have a trajectory that reaches the trivial cycle.
Such a strong result is not known, but certain types of cycles have been ruled out.

The type of a cycle may be defined with reference to the "shortcut" definition of the Collatz map, &lt;math&gt;f(n)=(3n+1)/2&lt;/math&gt; for odd ''n'' and &lt;math&gt;f(n)=n/2&lt;/math&gt; for even ''n''. A ''cycle'' is a {{nowrap|sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_0; a_1; \ldots; a_q)&lt;/math&gt;}} where &lt;math&gt;f(a_0)=a_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(a_1)=a_2&lt;/math&gt;, and so on, up to &lt;math&gt;f(a_q)=a_0&lt;/math&gt; in a closed loop. For this shortcut definition, the only known cycle is (1; 2). Although 4 is part of the single known cycle for the original Collatz map, it is not part of the cycle for the shortcut map.

A ''k''-cycle is a cycle that can be partitioned into 2''k'' contiguous subsequences: ''k'' increasing sequences of odd numbers alternating with ''k'' decreasing sequences of even numbers. For instance, if the cycle consists of a single increasing sequence of odd numbers followed by a decreasing sequence of even numbers, it is called a ''1-cycle''.&lt;ref name="Simons &amp; de Weger (2003)"/&gt;

Steiner (1977) proved that there is no 1-cycle other than the trivial (1;2).&lt;ref name="Steiner (1977)"/&gt; Simons (2004) used Steiner's method to prove that there is no 2-cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simons |first=John L. |year=2005 |title=On the nonexistence of 2-cycles for the 3x+1 problem |journal=Math. Comp. |volume=74 |issue= |pages=1565–72 |mr=2137019 |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/2005-74-251/S0025-5718-04-01728-4/ |doi=10.1090/s0025-5718-04-01728-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simons &amp; de Weger (2005) extended this proof up to 68-cycles: there is no ''k''-cycle up to ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;68.&lt;ref name="Simons &amp; de Weger (2003)"/&gt; Beyond 68, this method gives upper bounds for the elements in such a cycle: for example, if there is a 75-cycle, then at least one element of the cycle is less than 2385×2&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Simons &amp; de Weger (2003)"/&gt; Therefore, as exhaustive computer searches continue, larger cycles may be ruled out. To state the argument more intuitively: we need not look for cycles that have at most 68 trajectories, where each trajectory consists of consecutive ups followed by consecutive downs.  See [[#Cycle bounds|below]] for an idea of how one might find an upper bound for the elements of a cycle.

==Supporting arguments==
Although the conjecture has not been proven, most mathematicians who have looked into the problem think the conjecture is true because experimental evidence and heuristic arguments support it.

===Experimental evidence===
{{asof|2017}}, the conjecture has been checked by computer for all starting values up to 87 * 2&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Roosendaal2&gt;{{cite web |last=Roosendaal |first=Eric |title=On the 3x+1 Problem |url=http://www.ericr.nl/wondrous/ |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All initial values tested so far eventually end in the repeating cycle (4; 2; 1), which has only three terms.  From this lower bound on the starting value, a lower bound can also be obtained for the number of terms a repeating cycle other than (4; 2; 1) must have.&lt;ref name=Garner&gt;{{cite web |last=Garner |first=Lynn E. |title=On The Collatz 3n + 1 Algorithm |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1981-082-01/S0002-9939-1981-0603593-2/S0002-9939-1981-0603593-2.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this relationship was established in 1981, the formula gave a lower bound of 35,400 terms.&lt;ref name=Garner/&gt;

This computer evidence is not a proof that the conjecture is true. As shown in the cases of the [[Pólya conjecture]], the [[Mertens conjecture]], and [[Skewes' number]], sometimes a conjecture's only [[counterexamples]] are found when using very large numbers.

===A probabilistic heuristic===
If one considers only the ''odd'' numbers in the sequence generated by the Collatz process, then each odd number is on average 3/4 of the previous one.{{refn|{{named ref|name=Lagarias (1985)}} section "[http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/organics/papers/lagarias/paper/html/node3.html A heuristic argument"].}} (More precisely, the geometric mean of the ratios of outcomes is 3/4.) This yields a heuristic argument that every Hailstone sequence should decrease in the long run, although this is not evidence against other cycles, only against divergence.  The argument is not a proof because it assumes that Hailstone sequences are assembled from uncorrelated probabilistic events.  (It does rigorously establish that the [[p-adic numbers|2-adic]] extension of the Collatz process has two division steps for every multiplication step for almost all 2-adic starting values.)

And even if the probabilistic reasoning were rigorous, this would still imply only that the conjecture is [[almost surely]] true for any given integer, which does not necessarily imply that it is true for all integers.

===Rigorous bounds===
Although it is not known rigorously whether all positive numbers eventually reach one according to the Collatz iteration, it is known that many numbers do so. In particular, Krasikov and Lagarias showed that the number of integers in the interval [1,''x''] that eventually reach one is at least proportional to ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0.84&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Other formulations of the conjecture==

===In reverse===
[[File:Collatz-tree, depth=20.svg|thumb|upright=2|The first 21 levels of the ''Collatz [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]'' generated in bottom-up fashion. The graph includes all numbers with an orbit length of 21 or less.]]
There is another approach to prove the conjecture, which considers the bottom-up
method of growing the so-called ''Collatz graph''. The ''Collatz graph'' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] defined by the inverse [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]

: &lt;math&gt; R(n) = \begin{cases} \{2n\} &amp; \text{if } n\equiv 0,1,2,3,5 \\ \{2n,(n-1)/3\} &amp; \text{if } n\equiv 4 \end{cases} \pmod 6. &lt;/math&gt;

So, instead of proving that all positive integers eventually lead to 1, we can try to prove that 1 leads to all positive integers. For any integer ''n'', ''n'' ≡ 1 (mod 2) [[iff]] 3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;6). Equivalently, (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/3&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;2) iff ''n''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;6). Conjecturally, this inverse relation forms a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] except for the 1–2–4 loop (the inverse of the 4–2–1 loop of the unaltered function ''f'' defined in the [[Collatz conjecture#Statement of the problem|Statement of the problem]] section of this article).

When the relation 3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 of the function ''f'' is replaced by the common substitute "shortcut" relation (3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)/2, the Collatz graph is defined by the inverse relation,

: &lt;math&gt; R(n) = \begin{cases} \{2n\} &amp; \text{if } n\equiv 0,1 \\ \{2n,(2n-1)/3\} &amp; \text{if } n\equiv 2 \end{cases} \pmod 3. &lt;/math&gt;

For any integer ''n'', ''n'' ≡ 1 (mod 2) iff (3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)/2&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;3). Equivalently, (2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/3&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;2) iff ''n''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;3). Conjecturally, this inverse relation forms a tree except for a 1–2 loop (the inverse of the 1–2 loop of the function f(n) revised as indicated above).

Alternately, replace the 3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1  with '' n' / H(n') '' where '' n' '' = 3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1  and '' H(n') '' is the highest power of 2 that divides '' n' '' (with no [[remainder]]).  The resulting function '' f '' maps from [[odd number]]s to odd numbers.  Now suppose that for some odd number ''n'', applying this operation '' k '' times yields the number 1 (that is, &lt;math&gt;f^k(n) = 1&lt;/math&gt;).  Then in [[Binary number|binary]], the number '' n '' can be written as the concatenation of [[String (computer science)|strings]] ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sub&gt; … ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; where each ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt; is a finite and contiguous extract from the representation of 1/3&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Colussi2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Colussi |first=Livio |date=9 September 2011 |title=The convergence classes of Collatz function |journal=Theoretical Computer Science |doi=10.1016/j.tcs.2011.05.056 |volume=412 |issue=39 |pages=5409–5419}}&lt;/ref&gt; The representation of '' n '' therefore holds the [[Repeating decimal|repetends]] of 1/3&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;, where each repetend is optionally rotated and then replicated up to a finite number of bits.

===As an abstract machine that computes in base two===
Repeated applications of the Collatz function can be represented as an [[abstract machine]] that handles [[string (computer science)|strings]] of [[bit]]s.  The machine will perform the following three steps on any odd number until only one "1" remains:

# Append 1 to the (right) end of the number in binary (giving 2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1);
# Add this to the original number by binary addition (giving 2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'' =&amp;nbsp;3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1);
# Remove all trailing "0"s (i.e. repeatedly divide by two until the result is odd).

This prescription is plainly equivalent to computing a Hailstone sequence in base two.

====Example====
The starting number 7 is written in base two as 111.  The resulting Hailstone sequence is:

&lt;div style="font-family:'Courier New', 'Lucida Console', 'Courier', Monospace"&gt;
            111
           &lt;u&gt;1111&lt;/u&gt;
          1011&lt;s&gt;0&lt;/s&gt;
         &lt;u&gt;10111&lt;/u&gt;
        10001&lt;s&gt;0&lt;/s&gt;
       &lt;u&gt;100011&lt;/u&gt;
       1101&lt;s&gt;00&lt;/s&gt;
      &lt;u&gt;11011&lt;/u&gt;
     101&lt;s&gt;000&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;u&gt;1011&lt;/u&gt;
   1&lt;s&gt;0000&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

===As a parity sequence===
For this section, consider the Collatz function in the slightly modified form

: &lt;math&gt; f(n) = \begin{cases} n/2 &amp;\text{if } n \equiv 0 \\ (3n +1)/2 &amp; \text{if } n \equiv 1 \end{cases} \pmod{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be done because when ''n'' is odd, 3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is always even.

If P(…) is the parity of a number, that is P(2''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and P(2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) =&amp;nbsp;1, then we can define the Hailstone parity sequence (or parity vector) for a number ''n'' as ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = P(''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''), where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n'', and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;).

What operation is performed (3n + 1)/2 or n/2 depends on the parity. The parity sequence is the same as the sequence of operations.
 
Using this form for ''f''(''n''), it can be shown that the parity sequences for two numbers ''m'' and ''n'' will agree in the first ''k'' terms if and only if ''m'' and ''n'' are equivalent modulo 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.  This implies that every number is uniquely identified by its parity sequence, and moreover that if there are multiple Hailstone cycles, then their corresponding parity cycles must be different.&lt;ref name="Lagarias (1985)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Applying the ''f'' function ''k'' times to the number ''a''·2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'' will give the result ''a''·3&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''d'', where ''d'' is the result of applying the ''f'' function ''k'' times to ''b'', and ''c'' is how many odd numbers were encountered during that sequence.

===As a tag system===
For the Collatz function in the form

&lt;math&gt; f(n) = \begin{cases} n/2 &amp;\text{if } n \equiv 0 \\ (3n +1)/2 &amp; \text{if } n \equiv 1. \end{cases} \pmod{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Hailstone sequences can be computed by the extremely simple
[[Tag system#Example: Computation of Hailstone sequences|2-tag system]] with production rules
''a'' → ''bc'', ''b'' → ''a'', ''c'' → ''aaa''.  In this system, the positive integer ''n'' is represented by a string of ''n'' ''a'', and iteration of the tag operation halts on any word of length less than&amp;nbsp;2. (Adapted from De Mol.)

The Collatz conjecture equivalently states that this tag system, with an arbitrary finite string of ''a'''s as the initial word, eventually halts (see ''[[Tag system#Example: Computation of Collatz sequences]]'' for a worked example).

==Extensions to larger domains==

===Iterating on all integers===
An extension to the Collatz conjecture is to include all integers, not just positive integers. Leaving aside the cycle 0 → 0 which cannot be entered from outside, there are a total of 4 known cycles, which all nonzero integers seem to eventually fall into under iteration of ''f''.  These cycles are listed here, starting with the well-known cycle for positive&amp;nbsp;''n'':

Odd values are listed in large bold. Each cycle is listed with its member of least absolute value (which is always odd) first.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! Cycle !! Odd-value cycle length !! Full cycle length
|-
|style="text-align: left;"| &lt;big&gt;'''1'''&lt;/big&gt; → 4 → 2 → &lt;big&gt;'''1'''&lt;/big&gt; '''…''' || 1 || 3

|-
|style="text-align: left;"| &lt;big&gt;'''−17'''&lt;/big&gt; → −50 → &lt;big&gt;'''−25'''&lt;/big&gt; → −74 → &lt;big&gt;'''−37'''&lt;/big&gt; → −110 → &lt;big&gt;'''−55'''&lt;/big&gt; → −164 → −82 → &lt;big&gt;'''−41'''&lt;/big&gt; → −122 → &lt;big&gt;'''−61'''&lt;/big&gt; → −182 → &lt;big&gt;'''−91'''&lt;/big&gt; → −272 → −136 → −68 → −34 → &lt;big&gt;'''−17'''&lt;/big&gt; '''…''' || 7 || 18
|}

The generalized Collatz conjecture is the assertion that every integer, under iteration by ''f'', eventually falls into one of the four cycles above or the cycle 0 → 0.
The 0 → 0 cycle is often regarded as "trivial" by the argument, as it is only included for the sake of completeness.

===Iterating with odd denominators or 2-adic integers===
The standard Collatz map can be extended to (positive or negative) rational numbers which have odd denominators when written in lowest terms.  The number is taken to be odd or even according to whether its numerator is odd or even.  A closely related fact is that the Collatz map extends to the ring of [[2-adic integers]], which contains the ring of rationals with odd denominators as a subring.

The parity sequences as defined above are no longer unique for fractions.  However, it can be shown that any possible parity cycle is the parity sequence for exactly one fraction:  if a cycle has length ''n'' and includes odd numbers exactly ''m'' times at indices ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''m''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, then the unique fraction which generates that parity cycle is

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\frac{3^{m-1} 2^{k_0} + \cdots + 3^0 2^{k_{m-1}}}{2^n - 3^m}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

For example, the parity cycle (1 0 1 1 0 0 1) has length 7 and has 4 odd numbers at indices 0, 2, 3, and 6.  The unique fraction which generates that parity cycle is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3^3 2^0 + 3^2 2^2 + 3^1 2^3 + 3^0 2^6}{2^7 - 3^4} = \frac{151}{47},&lt;/math&gt;

the complete cycle being: 151/47 → 250/47 → 125/47 → 211/47 → 340/47 → 170/47 → 85/47 → 151/47

Although the cyclic permutations of the original parity sequence are unique fractions, the cycle is not unique, each permutation's fraction being the next number in the loop cycle:

:(0 1 1 0 0 1 1) → &lt;math&gt;\frac{3^3 2^1 + 3^2 2^2 + 3^1 2^5 + 3^0 2^6}{2^7 - 3^4} = \frac{250}{47}&lt;/math&gt;
:(1 1 0 0 1 1 0) → &lt;math&gt;\frac{3^3 2^0 + 3^2 2^1 + 3^1 2^4 + 3^0 2^5}{2^7 - 3^4} = \frac{{125}}{47}&lt;/math&gt;
:(1 0 0 1 1 0 1) → &lt;math&gt;\frac{3^3 2^0 + 3^2 2^3 + 3^1 2^4 + 3^0 2^6}{2^7 - 3^4} = \frac{211}{47}&lt;/math&gt;
:(0 0 1 1 0 1 1) → &lt;math&gt;\frac{3^3 2^2 + 3^2 2^3 + 3^1 2^5 + 3^0 2^6}{2^7 - 3^4} = \frac{340}{47}&lt;/math&gt;
:(0 1 1 0 1 1 0) → &lt;math&gt;\frac{3^3 2^1 + 3^2 2^2 + 3^1 2^4 + 3^0 2^5}{2^7 - 3^4} = \frac{170}{47}&lt;/math&gt;
:(1 1 0 1 1 0 0) → &lt;math&gt;\frac{3^3 2^0 + 3^2 2^1 + 3^1 2^3 + 3^0 2^4}{2^7 - 3^4} = \frac{85}{47}&lt;/math&gt;

Also, for uniqueness, the parity sequence should be "prime", i.e., not partitionable into identical sub-sequences. For example, parity sequence (1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0) can be partitioned into two identical sub-sequences (1 1 0 0)(1 1 0 0). Calculating the 8-element sequence fraction gives
:(1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0) → &lt;math&gt;\frac{3^3 2^0 + 3^2 2^1 + 3^1 2^4 + 3^0 2^5}{2^8 - 3^4} = \frac{125}{175}&lt;/math&gt;
But when reduced to lowest terms {5/7}, it is the same as that of the 4-element sub-sequence
:(1 1 0 0) → &lt;math&gt;\frac{3^1 2^0 + 3^0 2^1}{2^4 - 3^2} = \frac{5}{7}.&lt;/math&gt;
And this is because the 8-element parity sequence actually represents two circuits of the loop cycle defined by the 4-element parity sequence.

In this context, the Collatz conjecture is equivalent to saying that (0 1) is the only cycle which is generated by positive whole numbers (i.e. 1 and 2).

====Cycle bounds====
{{EquationNote|1|Eq. (1)}} also gives a rough idea about how one can prove that cycles of certain lengths do not exist.  For a hypothetical cycle of length ''n'', the numerator is bounded above by 3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; - 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (this corresponds to a cycle of all odd numbers).  A lower bound for the denominator can be obtained by letting ''n''/''m'' be an [[Continued fractions#Best rational approximations|optimal rational approximation]] to log(3)/log(2).  Together these give an upper bound for the unique fraction that generates a cycle of length ''n''.  If this upper bound is smaller than the [[#Experimental evidence|largest number for which the conjecture has been verified to hold]], then a cycle of length ''n'' is impossible.

===Iterating on real or complex numbers===
[[File:CobwebCollatz2.PNG|thumb|[[Cobweb plot]] of the orbit 10-5-8-4-2-1-2-1-2-1-etc. in the real extension of the Collatz map (optimized by replacing "3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1" with "(3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)/2")]]

The Collatz map can be viewed as the restriction to the integers of the smooth real and complex map

:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=\frac 1 2 z \cos^2\left(\frac \pi 2 z\right)+(3z+1)\sin^2\left(\frac \pi 2 z\right),&lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}(2 + 7z - (2 + 5z)\cos(\pi z)).&lt;/math&gt;

If the standard Collatz map defined above is optimized by replacing the relation 3''n'' + 1 with the common substitute "shortcut" relation (3''n'' + 1)/2, it can be viewed as the restriction to the integers of the smooth real and complex map

:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=\frac 1 2 z \cos^2\left(\frac \pi 2 z\right)+\frac {(3z+1)} {2} \sin^2\left(\frac \pi 2 z\right),&lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}(1 + 4z - (1 + 2z)\cos(\pi z))&lt;/math&gt;.

==Optimizations==
===Time–space tradeoff===
The section ''[[#As a parity sequence|As a parity sequence]]'' above gives a way to speed up simulation of the sequence.  To jump ahead ''k'' steps on each iteration (using the ''f'' function from that section), break up the current number into two parts, ''b'' (the ''k'' least significant bits, interpreted as an integer), and ''a'' (the rest of the bits as an integer).  The result of jumping ahead ''k'' steps can be found as:

:''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''a'' 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b'') = ''a'' 3&lt;sup&gt;''c''(b)&lt;/sup&gt; + ''d''(b).

The ''c'' (or better 3&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''d'' arrays are precalculated for all possible ''k''-bit numbers ''b'', where ''d''(b) is the result of applying the ''f'' function ''k'' times to ''b'', and ''c''(b) is the number of odd numbers encountered on the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Scollo |first=Giuseppe |year=2007 |contribution=Looking for Class Records in the 3x+1 Problem by means of the COMETA Grid Infrastructure |title=Grid Open Days at the University of Palermo |url=http://www.dmi.unict.it/~scollo/seminars/gridpa2007/CR3x+1paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if k=5, you can jump ahead 5 steps on each iteration by separating out the 5 least significant bits of a number and using:

: ''c''(0..31) = {0,3,2,2,2,2,2,4,1,4,1,3,2,2,3,4,1,2,3,3,1,1,3,3,2,3,2,4,3,3,4,5}
: ''d''(0..31) = {0,2,1,1,2,2,2,20,1,26,1,10,4,4,13,40,2,5,17,17,2,2,20,20,8,22,8,71,26,26,80,242}.

This requires 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; [[precomputation]] and storage to speed up the resulting calculation by a factor of ''k'', a [[space–time tradeoff]].

===Modular restrictions===
For the special purpose of searching for a counterexample to the Collatz conjecture, this precomputation leads to an even more important acceleration, used by Tomás Oliveira e Silva in his computational confirmations of the Collatz conjecture up to large values of&amp;nbsp;''n''.  If, for some given ''b'' and ''k'', the inequality

:''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''a'' 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'')  = ''a'' 3&lt;sup&gt;''c''(b)&lt;/sup&gt; + ''d''(b) &lt; ''a'' 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''

holds for all ''a'', then the first counterexample, if it exists, cannot be ''b'' modulo 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Garner/&gt;  For instance, the first counterexample must be odd because ''f''(2''n'') = ''n'', smaller than 2''n''; and it must be 3 mod 4 because ''f''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) =&amp;nbsp;3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, smaller than 4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.  For each starting value ''a'' which is not a counterexample to the Collatz conjecture, there is a ''k'' for which such an inequality holds, so checking the Collatz conjecture for one starting value is as good as checking an entire congruence class.  As ''k'' increases, the search only needs to check those residues ''b'' that are not eliminated by lower values of&amp;nbsp;''k''.  Only an exponentially small fraction of the residues survive.{{refn|{{named ref|name=Lagarias (1985)}} Theorem D.}} For example, the only surviving residues mod 32 are 7, 15, 27, and 31.

==Syracuse function==
If &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is an odd integer, then &lt;math&gt;3k+1&lt;/math&gt; is even, so &lt;math&gt;3k+1 = 2^{a}k^\prime&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; k^\prime &lt;/math&gt; odd and &lt;math&gt;a \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;.  The '''Syracuse function''' is the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; from the set &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of odd integers into itself, for which &lt;math&gt;f(k)=k^\prime&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A075677}}.

Some properties of the Syracuse function are:

* &lt;math&gt;\forall k \in I, f(4k+1)=f(k)&lt;/math&gt;. (Because &lt;math&gt;3(4k+1)+1=12k+4=4(3k+1)&lt;/math&gt;.)
* In more generality: For all &lt;math&gt;p \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; and odd &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f^{p-1}(2^ph-1)=2 \cdot 3^{p-1}h-1&lt;/math&gt;. (Here &lt;math&gt;f^{p-1}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Functional power|function iteration notation]].)
* For all odd &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;f(2h-1) \leq \frac{3h-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The Collatz  conjecture is equivalent to the statement that, for all &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f^n(k) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Undecidable generalizations ==
In 1972, [[John Horton Conway|J. H. Conway]] proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is algorithmically [[undecidable problem|undecidable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Conway |first=John H. |year=1972 |contribution=Unpredictable Iterations |title=Proc. 1972 Number Theory Conf., Univ. Colorado, Boulder |pages=49–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, he considered functions of the form

: &lt;math&gt;g(n) = a_i n + b_i,  {n\equiv i \pmod P}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_0,b_0,\ldots,a_{P-1},b_{P-1}&lt;/math&gt;
are rational numbers which are so chosen that &lt;math&gt;g(n)&lt;/math&gt; is always
integral.

The standard Collatz function is given by &lt;math&gt;P=2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_0 = \tfrac12&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_1 = 3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Conway proved that the problem:

: Given ''g'' and ''n'', does the sequence of iterates &lt;math&gt;g^k(n)&lt;/math&gt; reach 1?

is undecidable, by representing the [[halting problem]] in this way.
Closer to the Collatz problem is the following ''universally quantified'' problem:

: Given ''g'' does the sequence of iterates &lt;math&gt;g^k(n)&lt;/math&gt; reach 1, ''for all {{tmath|n&gt;0}}''?

Modifying the condition in this way can make a problem either harder or easier to solve (intuitively, it is harder to justify a positive answer but might be easier to justify a negative one).

'''Democratization''' (or '''democratisation''') is the transition to a more democratic [[political regime]]. It also refers to substantive political changes moving in a democratic direction. It may be the transition from an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime to a full [[democracy]], a transition from an authoritarian political system to a semi-democracy or transition from a [[semi-authoritarian]] political system to a [[democracy|democratic]] political system. The outcome may be [[Democratic consolidation|consolidated]] (as it was for example in the [[United Kingdom]]) or democratization may face frequent reversals (as it has faced for example in [[Venezuela]]). Different patterns of democratization are often used to explain other political phenomena, such as whether a country goes to a war or whether its economy grows. Democratization itself is influenced by various factors, including economic development, history, and civil society. The ideal result from democratization is to ensure that the people have the right to vote and have a voice in their political system.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Causes==

There is considerable debate about the factors which affect or ultimately limit democratization. A great many things, including economics, culture, and history, have been cited as impacting on the process. Some of the more frequently mentioned factors are:


* '''Wealth'''. A higher [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP/capita]] correlates with democracy and some claim the wealthiest democracies have never been observed to fall into authoritarianism.&lt;ref name='przeworski'&gt;{{cite book | last = Przeworski | first = Adam | authorlink = Adam Przeworski| title = Democracy and Development: Political Institutions and Well-Being in the World, 1950-1990 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | location = Cambridge|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of Hitler and of the Nazis in Weimar Germany can be seen as an obvious counter-example, but although in early 1930s Germany was already an advanced economy, by that time, the country was also living in a state of economic crisis virtually since the first World War (in the 1910s), a crisis which was eventually worsened by the effects of the Great Depression. There is also the general observation that democracy was very rare before the industrial revolution. Empirical research thus lead many to believe that economic development either increases chances for a transition to democracy ([[modernization theory]]), or helps newly established democracies consolidate.&lt;ref name='przeworski'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rice|first=Tom W.|last2=Ling|first2=Jeffrey|date=2002-12-01|title=Democracy, Economic Wealth and Social Capital: Sorting Out the Causal Connections |journal=Space and Polity|volume=6|issue=3|pages=307–325|doi=10.1080/1356257022000031995|issn=1356-2576}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study finds that economic development prompts democratization but only in the medium run (10–20 years). This is because development may entrench the incumbent leader but make it more difficult for him deliver the state to a son or trusted aide when he exits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Income, Democracy, and Leader Turnover|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12135/abstract|journal = American Journal of Political Science|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 1540-5907|pages = 927–942|volume = 59|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/ajps.12135|language = en|first = Daniel|last = Treisman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the debate about whether democracy is a consequence of wealth, a cause of it, or both processes are unrelated, is far from conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Traversa | first1 = Federico | year = 2014 | title = Income and the stability of democracy: Pushing beyond the borders of logic to explain a strong correlation? | url = | journal = Constitutional Political Economy | volume =  26| issue = | pages =  121–136| doi = 10.1007/s10602-014-9175-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggests that economic development depends on the political stability of a country to promote democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=FENG|first1=YI|title=Democracy, Political Stability and Economic Growth|journal=British Journal of Political Science|date=July 1997|volume=27|issue=3|pages=416, 391–418|doi=10.1017/S0007123497000197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark, Robert and Golder, in their reformulation of Albert Hirschman's model of ''Exit, Voice and Loyalty'', explain how it is not the increase of wealth in a country ''per se'' which influences a democratization process, but rather the changes in the socio-economic structures that come together with the increase of wealth. They explain how these structure changes have been called out to be one of the main reasons several European countries became democratic. When their socioeconomic structures shifted because modernization made the agriculture sector more efficient, bigger investments of time and resources were used for the manufacture and service sectors. In England, for example, members of the gentry began investing more on commercial activities that allowed them to become economically more important for the state. This new kind of productive activities came with new economic power were assets became more difficult for the state to count and hence more difficult to tax. Because of this, predation was no longer possible and the state had to negotiate with the new economic elites to extract revenue. A sustainable bargain had to be reached because the state became more dependent of its citizens remaining loyal and, with this, citizens had now leverage to be taken into account in the decision making process for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=William Roberts |first2=Matt |last2=Golder |first3=Sona N. |last3=Golder |year=2013 |title=Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game |work=Unpublished manuscript |publisher=University of Michigan and Pennsylvania State University |url=https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/clark_golder.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}

* '''Social equality'''. Acemoglu and Robinson argued that the relationship between [[social equality]] and democratic transition is complicated: People have less incentive to revolt in an egalitarian society (for example, [[Singapore]]), so the likelihood of democratization is lower. In a highly unequal society (for example, [[South Africa]] under [[Apartheid]]), the redistribution of wealth and power in a democracy would be so harmful to elites that these would do everything to prevent democratization. Democratization is more likely to emerge somewhere in the middle, in the countries, whose elites offer concessions because (1) they consider the threat of a revolution credible and (2) the cost of the concessions is not too high.&lt;ref name='acemoglu'&gt;{{cite book | last = Acemoglu | first = Daron |author2=James A. Robinson | title = Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2006 | location = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expectation is in line with the empirical research showing that democracy is more stable in egalitarian societies.&lt;ref name='przeworski'/&gt;

* '''Culture'''. It is claimed by some that certain cultures are simply more conductive to democratic values than others. This view is likely to be [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]]. Typically, it is [[Western culture]] which is cited as "best suited" to democracy, with other cultures portrayed as containing values which make democracy difficult or undesirable. This argument is sometimes used by undemocratic regimes to justify their failure to implement democratic reforms. Today, however, there are many non-Western democracies. Examples include: India, Japan, Indonesia, Namibia, Botswana, Taiwan, and South Korea. Research finds that "Western-educated leaders significantly and substantively improve a country's democratization prospects".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Who Democratizes? Western-educated Leaders and Regime Transitions|last1 = Gift|first1 = Thomas|last2 = Krcmaric|first2 = Daniel|year = 2015 |journal = Journal of Conflict Resolution |doi = 10.1177/0022002715590878|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Social Capital.''' Robert Putnam argues that certain characteristics make societies more likely to have cultures of civic engagement that lead to more participatory democracies.  Putnam argues that communities with denser horizontal networks of civic association are able to better build the "norms of trust, reciprocity, and civic engagement" that lead to democratization and well-functioning participatory democracies.  Putnam contrasts communities with dense horizontal networks, to communities built around vertical networks and patron-client relations which he asserts are unlikely to build the culture of civic engagement necessary for democratization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Robert|date=March 1993|title=What makes democracy work?|url=|journal=National Civic Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Dictatorship type'''. The three dictatorship types, monarchy, civilian and military have different approaches to democratization as a result of their individual goals. Monarchic and civilian dictatorships seek to remain in power indefinitely through hereditary rule in the case of monarchs or through oppression in the case of civilian dictators. A military dictatorship seizes power to act as a caretaker government to replace what they consider a flawed civilian government. Military dictatorships are more likely to transition to democracy because at the onset, they are meant to be stop-gap solutions while a new acceptable government forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Living by the Sword and Dying by the Sword? Leadership Transitions in and out of Dictatorships |journal = International Studies Quarterly|date = 2016-02-18|issn = 0020-8833|pages = sqv014|doi = 10.1093/isq/sqv014|language = en|first = Alexandre|last = Debs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheibub|first1=Jose Antonio|last2=Gandhi|first2=Jennifer|last3=Vreeland|first3=James|title=Democracy and Dictatorship Revisited|journal=Public Choice|date=2010|doi=10.1007/s11127-009-9491-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Peter|title=Democracy in Latin America|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Scrambled Constituencies.''' Mancur Olson theorizes that the process of democratization occurs when elites are unable to reconstitute an autocracy.  Olson suggests that this occurs when constituencies or identity groups are mixed within a geographic region.  He asserts that this mixed geographic constituencies requires elites to for democratic and representative institutions to control the region, and to limit the power of competing elite groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993|title=Dictatorship, Democracy and Development|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=567–576 |doi=10.2307/2938736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Education.''' It has long been theorized that education promotes stable and democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Capitalism and Freedom|last = Friedman|first = Milton|publisher = |year = 1962|isbn = |location = |pages = 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that education leads to greater political tolerance, increases the likelihood of political participation and reduces inequality.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The democratizing effect of education |journal = Research &amp; Politics|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 2053-1680|pages = 2053168015613360|volume = 2|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/2053168015613360|language = en|first = Eduardo|last = Alemán|first2 = Yeaji|last2 = Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study finds "that increases in levels of education improve levels of democracy and that the democratizing effect of education is more intense in poor countries".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''Urbanization'''. There is research to suggest that greater urbanization, through various pathways, contributes to democratization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glaeser|first=Edward L.|last2=Steinberg|first2=Bryce Millett|date=2017|title=Transforming Cities: Does Urbanization Promote Democratic Change? |journal=Regional Studies |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=58–68 |doi=10.1080/00343404.2016.1262020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Natural Resources'''. University of California, Berkeley political scientist Thad Dunning proposes a plausible explanation for Ecuador’s return to democracy that contradicts the conventional wisdom that natural resource rents encourage authoritarian governments. Dunning proposes that there are situations where natural resource rents, such as those acquired through oil, reduce the risk of distributive or social policies to the elite because the state has other sources of revenue to finance this kind of policies that is not the elite wealth or income.&lt;ref&gt;Thad Dunning. 2008. Crude Democracy: Natural Resource Wealth and Political Regimes.Cambridge University Press. Ch. 1.Pp. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; And in countries plagued with high inequality, which was the case of Ecuador in the 1970s, the result would be a higher likelihood of democratization.&lt;ref&gt;Thad Dunning. 2008. Crude Democracy: Natural Resource Wealth and Political Regimes.Cambridge University Press. Ch. 1.Pp. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the military coup had overthrown the government in large part because of the fears of elites that redistribution would take place.&lt;ref name="Thad Dunning 2008. Pp. 34"&gt;Thad Dunning. 2008. Crude Democracy: Natural Resource Wealth and Political Regimes.Cambridge University Press. Ch. 1.Pp. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year oil became an increasing financial source for the country.&lt;ref name="Thad Dunning 2008. Pp. 34"/&gt; Although the rents were used to finance the military, the eventual second oil boom of 1979 ran parallel to the country’s re-democratization.&lt;ref name="Thad Dunning 2008. Pp. 34"/&gt; Ecuador’s re-democratization can then be attributed, as argued by Dunning, to the large increase of oil rents, which enabled not only a surge in public spending but placated the fears of redistribution that had grappled the elite circles.&lt;ref name="Thad Dunning 2008. Pp. 34"/&gt; The exploitation of Ecuador’s resource rent enabled the government to implement price and wage policies that benefited citizens at no cost to the elite and allowed for a smooth transition and growth of democratic institutions.&lt;ref name="Thad Dunning 2008. Pp. 34"/&gt;
 
* '''Foreign trade'''. A 2016 study found that preferential trade agreements "encourage the democratization of a country, in particular if the PTA partners are themselves democracies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Coevolution of Trade Agreement Networks and Democracy |journal = Journal of Conflict Resolution|date = 2016-02-01|issn = 0022-0027|pages = 164–191|volume = 60|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/0022002714535431|language = en|first = Mark S.|last = Manger|first2 = Mark A.|last2 = Pickup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Democracy protests'''. Research indicates that democracy protests are associated with democratization. A 2016 study found that about a quarter of all cases of democracy protests between 1989-2011 lead to democratization.&lt;ref name='brancati'&gt;{{cite book | last = Brancati | first = Dawn | title = Democracy Protests: Origins, Features and Significance | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2016 | location = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Threat of civil conflict.''' Research suggests that the threat of civil conflict encourages regimes to make democratic concessions. A 2016 study found that drought-induced riots in Sub-Saharan Africa lead regimes, fearing conflict, to make democratic concessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aidt|first=Toke S.|last2=Leon|first2=Gabriel|date=2016-06-01|title=The Democratic Window of Opportunity Evidence from Riots in Sub-Saharan Africa |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|volume=60|issue=4|pages=694–717|doi=10.1177/0022002714564014|issn=0022-0027}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* '''Overthrow of dictators'''. Rebels may overthrow their dictators with the aim of establishing a democratic government, but this method is rarely successful. The death of a dictator rarely ushers in democracy. One analysis found that "of the 79 dictators who have died in office (1946-2014)... in the vast majority (92%) of cases, the regime persists after the autocrat's death."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/10/when-dictators-die/| title = When Dictators Die| website = Foreign Policy

* '''International cooperation'''. A 2002 study found that membership in international organizations "is correlated with transitions to democracy during the period from 1950 to 1992."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Democracy from the Outside-In?

* '''Foreign intervention'''. Democracies have often been imposed by military intervention, for example in Japan and Germany after WWII.&lt;ref name="GT"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Göran|last=Therborn|authorlink=Göran Therborn|year=1977|title=The rule of capital and the rise of democracy: Capital and suffrage (cover title) | journal=[[New&amp;nbsp;Left Review]]|series=I|volume=103|issue=[http://www.newleftreview.org/?issue=100 The advent of bourgeois democracy]|ref=harv|url=http://www.newleftreview.org/?view=1453|pages=3–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=47&amp;articleID=599 ''The Independent'']&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, [[decolonization]] sometimes facilitated the establishment of democracies that were soon replaced by authoritarian regimes. For example, Syria, after gaining independence from [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French mandatory control]] at the beginning of the [[Cold War]], failed to [[Democratic consolidation|consolidate]] its democracy, so it eventually collapsed and was replaced by a [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'athist dictatorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://sam.gov.tr/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/katarzyna_krokowska.pdf|title = The Fall of Democracy in Syria|last1 = Krokowska|first1 = Katarzyna|year = 2011|journal = Perceptions}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, most attempts to establish democracy by military means have failed.&lt;ref name="Keen2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keen |first1=David |title=Endless War?

* '''War-making'''. Jeffrey Herbst, in its acclaimed paper "War and the state in Africa", explains how democratization in European states was achieved through war making and how it is a cause of state formation missing in Africa today. He exemplifies how war caused the state to become more efficient in revenue collection, it forced leaders to improve administrative capabilities; and created and environment where populations could develop a sense of unification. European states where under constant threat of being invaded and bursting into war with their neighboring countries. This demand to be constantly vigilant enabled the development of effective revenue collection systems and, those states that did not raise sufficient revenue for war perished. War also created a common and powerful association between the state and its people, given that citizens felt threatened as a nation and, it was only as a nation that they would thrive. Fighting wars made people feel more associated with the state.&lt;ref&gt;Herbst, Jeffrey. “War and the State in Africa.” ''International Security'' (1990): 117-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Peace and security'''. Wars may contribute to the [[state building]] that precedes a transition to democracy, but war is also a serious obstacle to democratization. While adherants of the [[democratic peace theory]] believe that democracy comes before peace, historical evidence shows the opposite. In almost all cases, peace has come before democracy. There is little support for the hypothesis that democracy causes peace, but strong evidence for the opposite hypothesis that peace leads to democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibler |first1=Douglas M. |last2=Owsiak |first2=Andrew |title=Democracy and the Settlement of International Borders, 1919–2001 |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |date=2017 |doi=10.1177/0022002717708599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gat |first1=Azar |title=The Causes of War and the Spread of Peace: Will War Rebound? |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian Welzel|Christian Welzel's]] [[Freedom Rising|human empowerment theory]] posits that existential security leads to emancipative cultural values and support for a democratic political organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Welzel |first1=Christian |title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is in agreement with theories based on [[evolutionary psychology]]. The so-called regality theory finds that people develop a psychological preference for a strong leader and an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] form of government in situations of war or perceived collective danger. On the other hand, people will support [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] values and a preference for democracy in situations of peace and safety. The consequence of this is that a society will develop in the direction of [[autocracy]] and an authoritarian government when people perceive collective danger, while the development in the democratic direction requires collective safety.&lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers |doi=10.11647/OBP.0128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why almost all attempts to establish democracy by violent means have failed&lt;ref name="Keen2006" /&gt;

==Transitions==

Democracy development has often been slow, violent, and marked by frequent reversals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/gratis/Berman-18-1.pdf ''Journal of Democracy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical cases===
In Great Britain, there was [[Magna Carta#17th–18th centuries|renewed interest in Magna Carta]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/videos/from-legal-document-to-public-myth-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century|title=From legal document to public myth: Magna Carta in the 17th century|website=The British Library|access-date=2017-10-16|postscript=none}}; {{Cite web|url=https://www.sal.org.uk/events/2015/06/magna-carta-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century/|title=Magna Carta: Magna Carta in the 17th Century|website=The Society of Antiquaries of London|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliament of England]] enacted the [[Petition of Right]] in 1628 which established certain liberties for subjects.

The [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688 established a strong Parliament that passed the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], which codified certain rights and liberties for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|publisher=British Library|accessdate=27 November 2015|quote=The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown....

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The "rights of man" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/citizenship2.htm|title=Rise of Parliament|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only with the [[Representation of the People Act 1884]] did a majority of the males get the vote.

The [[American Revolution]] (1765–1783) created the United States. The new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] established a relatively strong federal national government that included an [[President of the United States|executive]], a [[United States Supreme Court|national judiciary]], and a bicameral [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] that represented states in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the population in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="Wood, 1992"&gt;Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 70&lt;/ref&gt; In many fields, it was a success ideologically in the sense that a relatively true republic was established that never had a single dictator, but [[Voting rights in the United States|voting rights]] were initially restricted to [[White American|white]] male property owners (about 6% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of Rights and Liberties - The Right of Suffrage|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|website=Online Exhibit: The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706144856/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|archivedate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was not abolished in the southern states until the constitutional [[Reconstruction Amendments|Amendments]] of the [[Reconstruction Era]] following the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) and the [[Civil Rights Movement|Civil Rights]] given to African-Americans were only achieved in the 1960s.

The [[French Revolution]] (1789) briefly allowed a wide franchise. The [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] lasted for more than twenty years. The [[French Directory]] was more oligarchic. The [[First French Empire]] and the [[Bourbon Restoration]] restored more autocratic rule. The [[Second French Republic]] had universal male suffrage but was followed by the [[Second French Empire]]. The [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–71) resulted in the [[French Third Republic]].

The [[German Empire]] was created in 1871. It was followed by the [[Weimar Republic]] after [[World War I]]. [[Nazi Germany]] restored autocratic rule before the defeat in [[World War II]] .

The [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], after the unification of Italy in 1861, was a [[constitutional monarchy]] with the King having considerable powers. [[Italian fascism]] created a dictatorship after the World War I. World War II resulted in the [[Italian Republic]].

The [[Meiji period]], after 1868, started the modernization of Japan. Limited democratic reforms were introduced. The [[Taishō period]] (1912–1926) saw more reforms. The beginning of the [[Shōwa period]] reversed this until the end of World War II.

===Since 1972===

According to a study by [[Freedom House]], in 67 countries where dictatorships have fallen since 1972, nonviolent civic resistance was a strong influence over 70 percent of the time. In these transitions, changes were catalyzed not through foreign invasion, and only rarely through armed revolt or voluntary elite-driven reforms, but overwhelmingly by democratic civil society organizations utilizing nonviolent action and other forms of civil resistance, such as strikes, boycotts, civil disobedience, and mass protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=70&amp;release=275 Study: Nonviolent Civic Resistance Key Factor in Building Durable Democracies, May 24, 2005 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indicators==
One influential survey in democratization is that of [[Freedom House]], which arose during the Cold War. Freedom House, today an institution and a think tank, produces one of the most comprehensive "freedom measures" nationally and internationally and by extension a measure of democratization. Freedom House categorizes all countries of the world according to a seven-point value system with over 200 questions on the survey and multiple survey representatives in various parts of every nation. The total raw points of every country places the country in one of three categories: Free, Partly Free, or not Free.

One study simultaneously examining the relationship between market economy (measured with one [[Index of Economic Freedom]]), economic development (measured with GDP/capita), and political freedom (measured with the Freedom House index) found that high [[economic freedom]] increases GDP/capita and a high GDP/capita increases economic freedom. A high GDP/capita also increases political freedom but political freedom did not increase GDP/capita. There was no direct relationship either way between economic freedom and political freedom if keeping GDP/capita constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ken Farr |author2=Richard A.

==Views==
[[Francis Fukuyama]] wrote another classic in democratization studies entitled ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' which spoke of the rise of [[liberal democracy]] as the final form of human government.  However it has been argued that the expansion of liberal economic reforms has had mixed effects on democratization.  In many ways, it is argued, democratic institutions have been constrained or "disciplined" in order to satisfy international capital markets or to facilitate the global flow of trade.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Alasdair S.,''Empowerment or Discipline? Two Logics of Governmental Reform'' (December 23, 2008). Available at [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1319792 http://ssrn.com/abstract=1319792 SSRN.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel P. Huntington]] wrote ''[[The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late 20th century|The Third Wave]]'', partly as response to Fukuyama, defining a global democratization trend in the world post WWII. Huntington defined three waves of democratization that have taken place in history.&lt;ref name='huntington'&gt;{{cite book | last = Huntington | first = Samuel P. | authorlink = Samuel P. Huntington | title = Democratization in the Late 20th century | publisher = University of Oklahoma Press | year = 1991 | location = Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first one brought democracy to Western Europe and Northern America in the 19th century. It was followed by a rise of dictatorships during the [[Interwar period]]. The second wave began after [[World War II]], but lost steam between 1962 and the mid-1970s. The latest wave began in 1974 and is still ongoing. Democratization of [[Latin America]] and the former [[Eastern Bloc]] is part of this [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave]].

A very good example of a region which passed through all the three waves of democratization is the Middle East. During the 15th century it was a part of the Ottoman Empire. In the 19th century, "when the empire finally collapsed [...] towards the end of the First World War, the Western armies finally moved in and occupied the region".&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Bromley. ''Rethinking Middle East Politics: State Formation and Development''. (Polity Press, Cambridge, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; This was an act of both European expansion and state-building in order to democratize the region.  However, what Posusney and Angrist argue is that, "the ethnic divisions [...] are [those that are] complicating the U.S. effort to democratize Iraq". This raises interesting questions about the role of combined foreign and domestic factors in the process of democratization. In addition, Edward Said labels as 'orientalist' the predominantly Western perception of "intrinsic incompatibility between democratic values and Islam". Moreover, he states that "the Middle East and North Africa lack the prerequisites of democratization".&lt;ref&gt;ed by Marsha, Pripstein Posusney and Michele, Penner Angrist. ''Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Regimes and Resistance''. ([[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], Inc., USA, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fareed Zakaria]] has examined the security interests benefited from [[democracy promotion]], pointing out the link between levels of democracy in a country and of terrorist activity. Though it is accepted that poverty in the Muslim world has been a leading contributor to the rise of terrorism, Zakaria has noted that the primary terrorists involved in the [[9/11]] attacks were among the upper and upper-middle classes. Zakaria has suggested that the society in which [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists lived provided easy money, and therefore there existed little incentive to modernize economically or politically.&lt;ref&gt;Fareed Zakaria, The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad, W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2007, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; With little opportunity to express themselves in the political sphere, scores of young Arab men were "invited to participate"&lt;ref&gt;Fareed Zakaria, The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad, W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; through another avenue: the culture of [[Islamic fundamentalism]]. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism and its violent expression on September 11, 2001 illustrates an inherent need to express oneself politically, and a democratic government or one with democratic aspects (such as political openness) is quite necessary to provide a forum for political expression.

Larry Pardy observed that governments are motivated by political power, which is generated by two factors: legitimacy and means.  The legitimacy of a democratic government is achieved through the consent of the population through fair and open elections while its financial means are derived from a healthy tax base generated by a vibrant economy.  Economic success is based on a free market economy with the following elements: property rights, a fair and independent judiciary, security, and the rule of law. The core elements that support economic freedom convey the same basic rights onto individuals.  Conversely, there can be no rule of law for investors when governments crack down on political opponents and no property rights for industry when personal wealth can be arbitrarily seized.

According to Clark, Golder, and Golder, an application of  [[Albert O. Hirschman]]'s exit, voice, and loyalty model is that if individuals have plausible exit options, then a government may be more likely to democratize. [[James C. Scott]] argues that governments may find it difficult to claim a sovereignty over a population when that population is in motion.&lt;ref name="C. 2010 7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/872296825|title=The Art of not being governed : an anarchist history of upland Southeast Asia|last=C.|first=Scott, James|date=2010|publisher=NUS Press|year=|isbn=9780300152289|location=|pages=7|oclc=872296825}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott additionally asserts that exit may not solely include physical exit from the territory of a coercive state, but can include a number of adaptive responses to coercion that make it more difficult for states to claim sovereignty over a population.  These responses can include planting crops that are more difficult for states to count, or tending livestock that are more mobile.  In fact, the entire political arrangement of a state is a result of individuals adapting to the environment, and making a choice as to whether or not to stay in a territory.&lt;ref name="C. 2010 7"/&gt; If people are free to move, then the exit, voice, and loyalty model predicts that a state will have to be of that population representative, and appease the populous in order to prevent them from leaving.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/clark_golder.pdf|title=Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If individuals have plausible exit options then they are better able to constrain a government’s arbitrary behaviour through threat of exit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, [[Alex Tabarrok]] argues that the reverse of this occurred in [[Ferguson, Missouri]]; those who could left the township, but ultimately the local government abused its power as people could not exit in part due to a string of excessive fines which forced them to stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/03/the-ferguson-kleptocracy.html|title=The Ferguson Kleptocracy|last=Tabarrok|first=Alex|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sustainable democracy has to involve far more than fair and open elections.  It rests on a solid foundation of economic and political freedom that, for Western nations, had to be pried from governments over centuries.  It goes back at least to 1215 when King John accepted limits on his powers and conceded certain rights in the Magna Carta.   Then, as now, governments will be motivated to support rights and freedoms only when it directly impacts the government's ability to maintain and exercise political power.  It does not arise with idealistic notions of democracy and freedom, implied fiscal contracts with citizens, exhortations from donor states or pronouncements from international agencies.  Fukyama was essentially correct with his assertion regarding the end of history – that Western liberal democracy represents the endpoint of mankind's ideological evolution.  It represents a mechanism whereby our free market system efficiently allocates resources in our economy while co-existing in a symbiotic relationship with our democratic system of government.   Our governments are incentivized to protect the economy while the foundations for that economy create the conditions for democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Pardy, Larry D.  Understanding the Determinants of Democracy: Opening the Black Box.  Amherst, NS: October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by political scientist Daniel Treisman, influential theories of democratization posit that autocrats "deliberately choose to share or surrender power. They do so to prevent revolution, motivate citizens to fight wars, incentivize governments to provide [[public goods]], outbid elite rivals, or limit factional violence. Examining the history of all democratizations since 1800, I show that such deliberate choice arguments may help explain up to one third of cases. In about two thirds, democratization occurred not because incumbent elites chose it but because, in trying to prevent it, they made mistakes that weakened their hold on power. Common mistakes include: calling elections or starting military conflicts, only to lose them; ignoring popular unrest and being overthrown; initiating limited reforms that get out of hand; and selecting a covert democrat as leader. These mistakes reflect well-known cognitive biases such as [[Overconfidence effect|overconfidence]] and the [[illusion of control]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treisman|first=Daniel|date=October 2017|title=Democracy by mistake|work=NBER Working Paper No. 23944 |doi=10.3386/w23944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other contexts==
Although democratization is most often thought of in the context of national or regional politics, the term can also be applied to:

===International bodies===
* International bodies (e.g. the [[United Nations]]) where there is an ongoing call for reform and altered voting structures and [[voting system]]s.

===Corporations===
The concept of democratization can also be applied in [[corporation]]s where the traditional power structure was top-down direction and the boss-knows-best (even a "[[Pointy-Haired Boss]]");   This is quite different from consultation, [[empowerment]] (of lower levels) and a diffusion of [[decision making]] (power) throughout the firm, as advocated by [[workplace democracy]] movements.

===The Internet===
The loose anarchistic structure of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] and the [[Internet]] itself have inspired some groups to call for more democratization of how [[domain name]]s are held, upheld, and lost.  They note that the [[Domain Name System]] under [[ICANN]] is the least democratic and most centralized part of the Internet, using a simple model of first-come-first-served to the names of things. [[Ralph Nader]] called this "corporatization of the dictionary."

===Knowledge===
The [[democratization of knowledge]] is the spread of knowledge among common people, in contrast to knowledge being controlled by elite groups.

===Design===
The trend that products from well-known designers are becoming cheaper and more available to masses of consumers. Also, the trend of companies sourcing design decisions from end users.&lt;ref&gt;Harry (2007). [http://mocoloco.com/the-democratization-of-design/ The Democratization of Design]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Dick (disambiguation)}}

'''Dick''' is a common [[English language]] [[dysphemism]] used for a variety of slang purposes, some generally considered [[vulgarity|vulgar]]. It is used to refer to the [[Human penis|penis]],&lt;ref name="Partridge"&gt;Eric Partridge, Paul Beale, ''A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'' (1984), p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; and by extension as a verb to describe [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. It is also used as a [[pejorative]] term for individuals who are considered to be [[rudeness|rude]], abrasive, inconsiderate, or otherwise contemptible.&lt;ref name="Partridge"/&gt; In this context, it can be used interchangeably with ''jerk'', and can also be used as a verb to describe rude or [[deception|deceitful]] actions. Variants include '''dickhead''', which literally refers to the [[Glans penis|glans]]. The offensiveness of the word ''dick'' is complicated by the continued use of the word in inoffensive contexts, including as both a given name [[Dick (surname)|and a surname]], in the popular British dessert [[spotted dick]], in the classic novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', and in the ''[[Dick and Jane]]'' series of children's books. Uses such as these have provided a basis for comedy writers to exploit this juxtaposition through [[double entendre]].

==Origin and evolution==
The word connoted a person of questionable character long before it became a nickname for the penis. For example, in the 1665 [[satire]] ''The English Rogue'' by [[Richard Head]], an unsavory character is referred to as a "dick":
{{quotation|The next Dick I pickt up for her was a man of a colour as contrary to the former, as light is to darkness, being swarthy; whose hair was as black as a sloe; middle statur'd, well set, both strong and active, a man so universally tryed, and so fruitfully successful, that there was hardly any female within ten miles gotten with child in hugger-mugger, but he was more than suspected to be Father of all the legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Head, Francis Kirkman, ''The English Rogue: Described in the Life of Meriton Latroon and Other Extravagants'' (1674 ed.), p. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An 1869 slang dictionary offered definitions of ''dick'' including "a riding whip" and an abbreviation of dictionary, also noting that in the [[Northern England|North Country]], it was used as a verb to indicate that a policeman was eyeing the subject.&lt;ref&gt;John Camden Hotten, ''The Slang Dictionary: Or, the Vulgar Words, Street Phrases, and "Fast" Expressions of High and Low Society'' (1869), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The term came to be associated with the penis through usage by men in the military around the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Partridge"/&gt;

==Offensiveness==
"Dick", when used in many of its slang connotations, is generally considered at least mildly offensive. 

In 1994, the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]] upheld a school policy under which a student was prohibited from wearing a T-shirt with a [[double entendre]], reading "See Dick Drink. See Dick Drive. See Dick Die. Don’t be a Dick."&lt;ref&gt;''Pyle v. South Hadley School Committee'', 861 F. Supp. 157, 159 (D. Mass. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; The court in this case held that a legitimate goal of the school—to calm a sexually charged environment and enhance the ability of students to learn—made it unlikely that this restriction was a violation of any [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Condon, Patricia M. Wolff, ''School Rights: A Parent's Legal Handbook and Action Guide'' (1996), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was vacated the following year by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]], which noted that students have the right to express their views, and that the T-shirt, "though reasonably thought vulgar", did express a view.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-1st-circuit/1316740.html Pyle v. South Hadley School Committee]'', 55 F.3d 20, 21 (1st Cir. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) published guidelines that summarized instances in which a number of media outlets had violated indecency laws when  using the word "dick" in a sexual context. These included, for example, the [[State University of New York]]'s [[WSUC-FM]], in [[Cortland, New York]], which in 1993 was fined for broadcasting a rap titled "I'm Not Your Puppet", which referenced "shoving my dick up this bitch's behind" in one lyric, and stated in another, "I pulled out my dick, popped it in her mouth, and she sucked it."&lt;ref name="FCC2001"&gt;[[Federal Communications Commission]], ''[http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Enforcement/Orders/2001/fcc01090.pdf In the Matter of Industry Guidance On the Commission’s Case Law Interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 1464 and Enforcement Policies Regarding Broadcast Indecency]'', File No. EB-00-IH-0089 (April 6, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In the same report, however, the FCC noted that in 1990, it had ruled that [[WFBQ]] (FM)/[[WNDE]] (AM) in [[Indianapolis]] had not engaged in indecency when it broadcast the line "So you talk to [[Dick Nixon]], man you get him on the phone and Dick suggests maybe getting like a mega-Dick to help out, but you know, you remember the time the King ate mega-Dick under the table at a 095 picnic", and a parody commercial referencing a fictional [[monster truck]] called "Big Peter! Formerly the Big Dick's Dog Wiener Mobile".&lt;ref name="FCC2001"/&gt; In January 2005, the FCC released a ruling that it would not fine broadcasters whose programs used "dick" on the air to refer to a person behaving contemptibly.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Ahrens, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33911-2005Jan24.html FCC Dismisses 36 Indecency Complaints as Not 'Patently Offensive']", ''Washington Post'' (January 25, 2005), Page E01.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the FCC stated in its ruling:

{{quotation|A number of complaints cite isolated uses of the word "dick" or variations thereof.  In context and as used in the complained of broadcasts, these were epithets intended to denigrate or criticize their subjects.  Their use in this context was not sufficiently explicit or graphic and/or sustained to be patently offensive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Communications Commission]], ''[http://transition.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2005/FCC-04-279A1.html In the Matter of Complaints by Parents Television Council, et al., Against Various Broadcast Licensees Regarding Their Airing Of Allegedly Indecent Material]'', File No. EB-03-IH-0357 (January 24, 2005), ¶ 8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The name of the traditional British dessert [[spotted dick]] has occasionally been perceived as potentially embarrassing, prompting hospital managers at [[Gloucestershire]] [[NHS South West|NHS Trust]] (in 2001)&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2249273.stm Spotted Dick back on menu] 10 Sept 2002 [[bbc.co.uk|BBC]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the catering staff at [[Flintshire County Council]] (in 2009) to rename the pudding ''Spotted Richard'' on menus, as many customers made "immature comments" about the pudding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/8243648.stm Pudding renamed Spotted Richard] BBC News  8 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gloucestershire NHS Trust restored the original name in 2002 and Flintshire County Council reversed their renaming after a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/8270460.stm Spotted Dick back on council menu] [[BBC News]] 23 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other meanings==
The word ''dick'' has (or has had) other slang meanings, for instance:
* It is used in the sense of "nothing", a figurative use of the sense "penis" (similar to the use of ''fuck'' and ''shit'' in a similar sense), as in "Nowadays you don't mean dick to me" (Amy Winehouse, 2008, cited by Green, 2008).&lt;ref name="Green penis"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green's Dictionary of Slang|first=Jonathon |last=Green |volume=1 |publisher=Chambers |date=2008 |isbn=978-0550-10443-4|page=1578 |url=https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/7xn3mmi|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is used as a slang term for [[detective]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dick&lt;/ref&gt; as in "Hiring a private dick to help locate her natural mother" (''The Guardian'', 1999, cited by Green, 2008).&lt;ref name="Green detective"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green's Dictionary of Slang|first=Jonathon |last=Green |volume=1 |publisher=Chambers |date=2008 |isbn=978-0550-10443-4|page=1581 |url=https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/4z7pnia|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meaning may derive from the Gipsy slang ''dekko'', ''dekker'' from [[Romani language|Romany]] ''dik'', to look).&lt;ref name="Green detective"/&gt;

He was awarded the [[Melsom Prize]] in 2006,&lt;ref name=oktober-melsom-2006&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oktober.no/nor/presse/pressemeldinger/edvard_hoem_tildelt_melsomprisen_2006|title=Edvard Hoem tildelt Melsomprisen 2006|work= |year=2006 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''Peter Dass Prize'' in 2007 for the novel ''Mors og fars historie''.

The Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia was [[:m:Requests for new languages/Wikipedia Egyptian Arabic|proposed on 30 March 2008]] and started as a developing project on 2 April 2008 in the [[Wikimedia Incubator]].&lt;ref name=Panovicp94/&gt; A Wikipedian with the username Ghaly was the founder of the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="Panovicp101"&gt;Panović, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ivan Panović, the author of "The Beginnings of Wikipedia Masry," described Ghaly as the ''[[spiritus movens]]'' of the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="Panovicp100"&gt;Panović, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florence Devouard]], the former president of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], stated that the foundation wanted Wikipedians to participate in their native languages.&lt;ref name="Heb"/&gt;

The [[:n:en:Wikimania 2008 opens at Bibliotheca Alexandrina, Egypt|proposal was accepted in July 2008]],&lt;ref name=Panovicp94/&gt; and the announcement was made on the first day of [[Wikimania#Wikimania 2008|Wikimania 2008]] in [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="Heb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lesdebats.com"&gt;[http://www.lesdebats.com/editionsdebats/301209/culture.htm (In French) Lesdebate, ''{{Lang|fr|Syndrome identitaire, Le masri langue Wikipedienne}}''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304083226/http://www.lesdebats.com/editionsdebats/301209/culture.htm |date=4 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November 2008, the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia was officially launched,&lt;ref name=Panovicp94/&gt; and the Incubator articles were transferred to [[:w:arz:الصفحه الرئيسيه|the new domain]].

In 2009, the Wikipedia had 4,000 articles, and Wikipedians participating came from within and outside Egypt.&lt;ref name="Heb"/&gt; By 2010 the Masry Wikipedia had almost 6,000 articles. That year, Panović wrote that "The number of active contributors is still rather small, yet their entries seem to be growing."&lt;ref name=Panovicp94/&gt; At the time many of the articles were very short articles, or "stubs".&lt;ref name=Panovicp94/&gt; Panović wrote that editors of the Masry Wikipedia had a tendency of creating new articles "just for the sake of increasing their number in hopes of expanding them later."&lt;ref name="Panovicp9495"&gt;Panović, p. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The origin of the proposal for the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia is based on the active interest of some [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] Wikipedians in contributing articles, especially on the [[Arabic Wikipedia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/21/technology/21iht-link21.1.14629408.html |publisher=''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' |first=Noam |last=Cohen |date=21 July 2008 |title=In Egypt, Wikipedia is more than hobby |accessdate=14 December 2008 }} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080803063734/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/07/21/business/link21.php Archive])&lt;!--Old URL: https://web.archive.org/web/20080803063734/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/07/21/business/link21.php--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as they constitute large group of the serious contributors in that Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="Heb" /&gt;

The idea behind the creation of the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia is to have an [[encyclopedia| encyclopedia]] that is written in the language that Egyptians use in their everyday lives.&lt;ref name="Mennassat"&gt;[http://www.menassat.com/?q=ar/news-articles/7058- Mennasat]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114025153/http://www.menassat.com/?q=ar%2Fnews-articles%2F7058- |date=14 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped this will be much easier for Egyptians to read and encourage more Egyptians to contribute to Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="Heb" /&gt;

Panović stated that "it is clear that Masry Wikipedians are the proponents of Egyptian territorial nationalism of a kind that sets itself apart from Arab or Islamic nationalism, seeking to carve out a specifically Egyptian identity" and he argued that therefore there was an "ease" in which the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedians "seem to embrace and promote some radical and even erroneous ideas about language."&lt;ref&gt;Panović, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghaly is a [[Coptic Christian|Christian]], and Panović stated that "judging by their contributions and/or user pages" several of those involved are also Christian; Panović stated that minority groups tend to be more active in identity politics.&lt;ref name=Panovicp100/&gt;

==Development==
The [[International Organisation for Standardisation]] (ISO) classification of [[Egyptian Arabic]] under the [[language code]] ''arz'' is one of the arguments used by Egyptian Arabic Wikipedians for considering Masry an independent language.&lt;ref name="Panovicp96"&gt;Panović, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The project uses the [[Cairo|Cairene]]-style Egyptian Arabic.&lt;ref name="Panovicp97"&gt;Panović, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghaly, in the Wikimedia Foundation proposal page for the Egyptian Wikipedia, stated that his view of the Masry Wikipedia was that it would be "written in layperson terms and a mixture between Egyptian slang and simple Arabic", conveying "the information to speakers of Egyptian Arabic in a way similar to what [[Wikipedia Simple English]] is doing currently in comparison to [[Wikipedia English]]."&lt;ref name=Panovicp96 /&gt; In response some Wikipedians criticized the proposal stating that it would be a Simple Arabic Wikipedia. Ghaly responded, arguing that he did not intend to actually start a simple Arabic Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=Panovicp96/&gt;

{{As of|2013|10}}, the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia has over 11,000 articles and continues to grow. In addition, there is a project to develop an Egyptian Arabic [[Wiktionary]], which is in the development phase as a project on Wikimedia incubator.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

== Reaction ==
The Egyptian variant of Wikipedia was controversially received; supporters pointed to the number of Wikipedias written in regional languages and argued that Egyptian Arabic was a widely spoken variant of Arabic, while opponents perceived the creation of the Egyptian language Wikipedia as an attack on the [[Arabic Wikipedia]] and argued that [[Standard Arabic]] was the standard language for media, and the use of a regional language version was anachronistic.&lt;ref name="Heb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lesdebats.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mennassat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MEO"&gt;[http://www.middle-east-online.com/?id=94755 Middle Esat online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114035430/http://www.middle-east-online.com/?id=94755 |date=14 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia has been subject to controversy from the start, causing arguments between supporters and opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ar:جدل بين مدونين مصريين حول ويكيبيديا المصرية| language=Arabic |trans-title=Debate between the Egyptian bloggers on the Egyptian Wikipedia|publisher=Shorouk News|date=24 January 2009|url=http://www.shorouknews.com/contentdata.aspx?id=508|accessdate=12 March 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120303223237/http://www.shorouknews.com/contentdata.aspx?id=508 | archivedate = 2012-03-03| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been lengthy discussions before the approval of the proposal. Also, there were discussions on other websites apart from meta.Wikimedia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligentdesigns.net/blog/ intelligentdesigns.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003043951/http://intelligentdesigns.net/blog/ |date=3 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalvoices.org/2008/12/07/egypt-egyptian-dialect-wikipedia/ globalvoices.org: Egypt: Egyptian Dialect Wikipedia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113234943/http://globalvoices.org/2008/12/07/egypt-egyptian-dialect-wikipedia/ |date=13 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://swap.stanford.edu/20090608113607/http://egyptsguy.blogspot.com/2009/06/wikipedia-masry.html egyptsguy.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This was also based on the differences in definition of a language and a dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Approval of a Wikipedia in Egyptian Arabic (Masry) ignites debate over the difference between a language and a dialect|publisher=Page F30|date=11 June 2009|url=http://www.pagef30.com/2009/06/approval-of-wikipedia-in-egyptian.html|accessdate=13 March 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227194409/http://www.pagef30.com/2009/06/approval-of-wikipedia-in-egyptian.html | archivedate = 2012-02-27| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a result of [[diglossia]] in Egypt, where the written language is a different dialect than the language used daily,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Focus on Contemporary Arabic (Conversations with Native Speakers) |last= Abed  |first= Shukri B. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2006 |publisher= Yale University Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-300-10948-1 |page= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is not frequently written, although a certain amount of literature (particularly plays and poetry) exists written in the Egyptian dialect in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languagehelpers.com/languagefacts/arabic.html Language helpers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704175905/http://www.languagehelpers.com/languagefacts/arabic.html |date=4 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabsn.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1761:2010-06-06-09-46-56&amp;catid=49:2008-10-02-12-07-37&amp;Itemid=131 الوكالة العربية للأخبار العلميةarabsn.net ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mub"&gt;[http://www.almubasher.net/articles.php?action=show&amp;id=24661 Almubasher.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313111916/http://www.almubasher.net/articles.php?action=show&amp;id=24661 |date=13 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support ===
The proposal has been supported by many users and gained the approval of the language committee on Wikimedia. The wiki has less than 5 active editors who did lead to an increase in the number of articles.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Amira Samir of the ''[[Al-Ahram Hebdo]]'' reported that some Egyptians on the internet did not have a problem with the project, arguing that the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] was an independent body and therefore the Egyptian government could not force the inclusion or exclusion of any particular dialect.&lt;ref name="Heb"/&gt;

=== Opposition ===
Discussions and criticism has occurred in some [[Facebook]] groups and several blogs and forums.&lt;ref name=Panovicp100 /&gt; Samir stated that many online users believed that the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia was an attack on the Arabic language.&lt;ref name="Heb"/&gt; The primary criticism of the Wikipedia Masry involves the belief that a "degradation" of Arabic occurred when someone writes in a dialect. Panović argues that the criticism is "grounded in folk belief about language" and therefore it is a "futile task" to examine the arguments from a linguistic point of view.&lt;ref name="Panovicp100"/&gt; According to Panović, many of the critics took note that many involved with the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia were [[Christianity in Egypt|Christian]] and that they perceived the project to be antagonistic against the Arab identity and Islam.&lt;ref name=Panovicp100/&gt; Panović wrote that "It almost goes without saying there are also those who see in Wikipedia Masry yet another [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|Jewish plot]]."&lt;ref name=Panovicp100/&gt; Others see it as an attempt to divide the Arabs by emphasizing dialects.&lt;ref name="tecon" /&gt; According to Samir, some critics argued that the Egyptian Arabic language has a lack of rules and variations of meanings in words, and so it is an unsuitable language for an encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="Heb"/&gt;

Opposition to this version of Wikipedia has been strong during the proposal stage; opposition continued after the project officially launched&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moheet.com/show_files.aspx?fid=246797 Moheet.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107093413/http://www.moheet.com/show_files.aspx?fid=246797 |date=7 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Almesryoun"&gt;[http://www.almesryoon.com/news.aspx?id=39050 المصريون] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723215738/http://www.almesryoon.com/news.aspx?id=39050 |date=23 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including campaigns on [[Facebook]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Some of these campaigns encouraged users to vandalize the Egyptian Wikipedia. The main point which the opposition focuses on is that Egyptian Arabic is not a language,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pagesperso.univ-brest.fr/~e20603429/wikipedia_egypt.html pagesperso.univ-brest.fr: Why you should boycott the Egyptian Wikipedia] {{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} suggesting that the effort should be directed to development of [[Arabic Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omraneya.net/node/90829 omraneya.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422183057/http://www.omraneya.net/node/90829 |date=22 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The effectiveness of these campaigns remains to be seen, as the Wikipedia articles are still being developed and number of users is increasing.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Some critics gave racist criticism. For example, most of those who are included in the Egyptian version are Christians,&lt;ref name=Panovicp100/&gt; or they are a Jewish conspiracy,&lt;ref name=Panovicp100/&gt; and they forget that the language is not only a means of communication between the people and this is the main objective of its existence it is also used in all aspects of life among Egyptians, for example, social communication and social media sites they don't use the standard Arabic language As well as some authors by writing a lexicon of the language of the Egyptian language, which was issued recently and celebrations by the Library of Alexandria .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elbalad.news/2972331&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of PPP and the chronological events since the foundation of the party in 1967 has been written by Fakhar Zaman on the website of [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]].

== Chairman Academy of Letters ==
During his chairmanship of Pakistan Academy of Letters (11 May 2008 – 12 March 2012), he produced fourteen documentaries in English on the Sufi poets of Pakistan of about 40 minutes duration each. The documentaries were appreciated nationally and internationally. They were directed by Fakhar Zaman who had a background of film and TV studies from a Canadian university.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
There was a [[Pakistan Television Corporation]] (PTV) produced TV show in [[Urdu language|Urdu]] titled ''Hamarey Sufi Shoraa'' about the life and times of [[Pakistani]] [[Sufi]] [[poets]] that also aired and it was hosted by Fakhar Zaman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziUZ-W2IygU, Fakhar Zaman TV interview on YouTube] Retrieved 29 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Punjabi Congress ==
World Punjabi Congress (WPC) was established in 1985. Since its inception, Fakhar Zaman served as its Chairman, and he has been the Chairman of International Sufi Council since 2010. WPC has organized 30 international conferences on language, literature, culture and peace in Pakistan, India, Austria, France, Netherlands, UK, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Estonia, Canada and the US. During 2015, WPC and ISC (International Sufi Council) organized 12 national conferences on Sufi Poets from the four provinces of Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Punjabi Language Movements ==
Fakhar Zaman has been associated with the Punjabi language and culture movements since his university days and has struggled vehemently to get Punjabi language a rightful place in the province of Punjab. Despite his and his colleagues relentless efforts, the present government of Punjab of Pakistan Muslim League (N) has miserably failed to promote the Punjabi language in cahoots with anti-Punjabi elitist bureaucracy of Punjab.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Books==
Five of his Punjabi books were banned by Martial Law regime in 1978. Ban was lifted by Lahore High Court in 1996 i.e. after 18-years, a solitary case in the history of world literature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  His books are taught at postgraduate level in many Universities of the world. A number of PhD &amp; M.Phil. theses have been written on his Punjabi writings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He has been editing and publishing an English monthly "'''Voice'''" Urdu monthly "'''Bazgasht'''", Punjabi weekly "'''Wangaar'''", all of them were banned by Military regime.His writings especially Punjabi Novels &amp; Poetry have been translated into various languages of the world. Plays based on his Novels have been staged and televised in Pakistan &amp; India.

'''Finnish''' ({{Audio|fi-suomi.ogg|''suomi''}}, or ''suomen kieli'' {{IPA-fi|ˈsuo̯men ˈkie̯li|}}) is a [[Finnic language]] spoken by the majority of the population in [[Finland]] and by [[Finns|ethnic Finns]] outside Finland. Finnish is one of the two [[official languages]] of Finland (the other being the [[Swedish language]]); Finnish is also an official minority language in [[Sweden]]. In Sweden, both Standard Finnish and [[Meänkieli dialects|Meänkieli]], a Finnish dialect, are spoken. The [[Kven language]], a dialect of Finnish, is spoken in Northern Norway by a minority group of Finnish descent.

Finnish is a member of the [[Finnic languages|Finnic language family]] and is [[morphological typology|typologically]] between [[Fusional language|fusional]] and [[agglutinative language]]s. It modifies and [[inflection|inflects]] [[noun]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s and [[verb]]s, depending on their roles in the [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]].

==Classification==
Finnish is a member of the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] group of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] family of languages.  The Finnic group also includes [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and a few minority languages spoken around the [[Baltic Sea]].

Finnish demonstrates an affiliation with other [[Uralic languages]] (such as [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) in several respects including:

*Shared morphology:
**case suffixes such as [[Genitive case|genitive]] ''-n'', [[Partitive case|partitive]] ''-(t)a'' / ''-(t)ä'' ( &lt; Uralic *-ta, originally [[ablative case|ablative]]), [[Essive case|essive]] ''-na'' / ''-nä'' ( &lt; *-na, originally [[locative case|locative]])
**plural markers ''-t'' and ''-i-'' ( &lt; Uralic *-t and *-j, respectively)
**possessive suffixes such as 1st person singular ''-ni'' ( &lt; Uralic *-n-mi), 2nd person singular ''-si'' ( &lt; Uralic *-ti).
**various derivational suffixes (e.g. [[causative]] ''-tta/-ttä'' &lt; Uralic *-k-ta)
*Shared basic vocabulary displaying regular sound correspondences with the other Uralic languages (e.g. ''kala'' 'fish' ~ [[North Saami language|North Saami]] ''guolli'' ~ [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''hal''; and ''kadota'' 'disappear' ~ North Saami ''guođđit'' ~ Hungarian ''hagy'' 'leave (behind)'.

Several theories exist as to the geographic origin of Finnish and the other Uralic languages. The most widely held view is that they originated as a [[Proto-Uralic language]] somewhere in the [[boreal forest]] belt around the [[Ural Mountains]] region and/or the bend of the middle [[Volga]]. The strong case for Proto-Uralic is supported by common vocabulary with regularities in sound correspondences, as well as by the fact that the Uralic languages have many similarities in structure and grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finland.fi/life-society/whos-afraid-of-finnish/|title=Who's afraid of Finnish?|date=28 April 2009|website=thisisFINLAND}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Defense Language Institute]] in [[Monterey, California]], United States classifies Finnish as a level III language (of 4 levels) in terms of learning difficulty for native English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dliflc.edu/archive/documents/all9_new.pdf |title=Defense Language Institute |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319135036/http://www.dliflc.edu/archive/documents/all9_new.pdf |archivedate=March 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:Finsktalande södra sverige.png|right|thumb|Areas in Southern Sweden with a Finnish-speaking population (2005)]]
Finnish is spoken by about five million people, most of whom reside in Finland. There are also notable Finnish-speaking minorities in Sweden, Norway, Russia, Estonia, Brazil, Canada, and the United States. The majority of the population of Finland, 90.37% {{As of|2010|lc=on}}, speak Finnish as their [[first language]].&lt;ref name=lang_stats/&gt; The remainder speak [[Finland Swedish|Swedish]] (5.42%),&lt;ref name=lang_stats/&gt; [[Sami languages|Sami]] ([[Northern Sami|Northern]], [[Inari Sami language|Inari]], [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt]]) and other languages. It is spoken as a second language in Estonia by about 167,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/I_Databas/Population_census/PHC2011/01Demographic_and_ethno_cultural_characteristics/04Ethnic_nationality_Languages_Dialects/04Ethnic_nationality_Languages_Dialects.asp|title=Ethnic nationality.

Finnish language started to gain its role during the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], along with the nationalistic [[Fennoman movement]], and obtained its official status in the [[Diet of Finland|Finnish Diet]] of 1863. It enjoys the status of an [[Minority languages in Sweden|official minority language in Sweden]]. Under the [[Nordic Language Convention]], citizens of the [[Nordic countries]] speaking Finnish have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any interpretation or translation costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/avtal/sprak/sk/sprak_sprak.asp?lang=  Konvention mellan Sverige, Danmark, Finland, Island och Norge om nordiska medborgares rätt att använda sitt eget språk i annat nordiskt land] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418154217/http://www.norden.org/avtal/sprak/sk/sprak_sprak.asp?lang= |date=2007-04-18 }}, ''Nordic Council website''.

==History==

===Prehistory===
The [[Finnic languages]] evolved from the Proto-Finnic language after [[Sami languages|Sámi]] was separated from it around 1500–1000 BCE.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Current models assume three or more hypothetical Proto-Finnic proto-dialects evolving over the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/hum/sugl/proj/finnic.html|title=Omasta ja vieraasta rakentuminen|author= Laakso, Johanna|date=November 2000|quote=Recent research (Sammallahti 1977, Terho Itkonen 1983, Viitso 1985, 2000 etc., Koponen 1991, Salminen 1998 etc.) operates with three or more hypothetical Proto-Finnic proto-dialects and considers the evolution of present-day Finnic languages (partly) as a result of interference and amalgamation of (proto-)dialects.|accessdate=2007-09-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070826141005/http://www.helsinki.fi/hum/sugl/proj/finnic.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval period===
[[Birch bark letter no. 292|Birch bark letter 292]] from the early 13th Century is the first known document in any [[Finnic languages|Finnic language]]. The first known written example of Finnish was found in a German travel journal dating back to c.1450: ''Mÿnna tachton gernast spuho somen gelen emÿna daÿda'' (Modern Finnish: "Minä tahdon kernaasti puhua suomen kieltä, [mutta] en minä taida;" English: "I want to speak Finnish, [but] I am not able").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wulff|first=Christine|title=Zwei Finnische Sätze aus dem 15. Jahrhundert|journal=Ural-Altaische Jahrbücher NF Bd. 2|language=German|pages=90–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the travel journal, a Finnish bishop, whose name is unknown, was behind the above quotation. The contextually erroneous accusative case in ''gelen'' (Finnish ''kielen'') and the lack of the [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] ''mutta'' seem to indicate a foreign speaker with an incomplete grasp of [[Finnish grammar]], as errors with the numerous [[noun cases]] are typical of those learning Finnish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotus.fi/files/1291/Kielen_aika.pdf|title=Kielen aika Valtionhallinnon 200-vuotisnäyttelystä Kotimaisten kielten tutkimuskeskuksessa|date=2 October 2009|website=Kotus.fi|format=PDF|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finnish priestdom at the time was largely [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svenskfinland.fi/historyfin.htm|title=Svenskfinland.fi|publisher=Svenskfinland.fi|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202104119/http://svenskfinland.fi/historyfin.htm|archivedate=2014-02-02|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2012-04-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, when [[Finland under Swedish rule|Finland was under Swedish rule]], Finnish was solely an oral language. At the time the language of [[Hanseatic League|large-scale business]] was [[Middle Low German]], the language of administration [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and religious activities were held in [[Latin]]. This left few possibilities for Finnish-speakers to use their mother tongue in situations other than daily chores. From Swedish perspective Finnish was considered as an inferior language and in practice Finns lacked societal rights because they could not represent themselves in any official situation with their language. Swedes strived to obviate Finnish via clerk schools and Church service and by moving Swedish speaking population to Finnish speaking areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://journal.fi/tt/article/view/57138/19187|title=Kansallinen identiteetti Ruotsissa ja Suomessa 1600–1700-luvuilla näkymä|website=journal.fi|language=fi-FI|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing system===
[[File:Mikael Agricola by Albert Edelfelt.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Mikael Agricola]], a 19th-century drawing by [[Albert Edelfelt]]]]
[[File:Lonnrot4.jpg|thumb|[[Elias Lönnrot]] as depicted in a 19th-century caricature&amp;nbsp;– Lönnrot made several journeys to Karelia and Eastern Finland to collect folklore, from which he compiled the ''[[Kalevala]]'']]

The first comprehensive writing system for Finnish was created by [[Mikael Agricola]], a Finnish bishop, in the 16th century. He based his [[orthography]] on Swedish, German, and Latin. His ultimate plan was to [[Bible translations|translate the Bible]], but first he had to define rules on which the Finnish [[standard language]] still relies, particularly with respect to spelling.

Agricola's written language was based on western dialects of Finnish, and his intention was that each [[Finnish phonology|phoneme]] should correspond to one letter. Yet, Agricola was confronted with many problems in this endeavour and failed to achieve uniformity. This is why he might use different signs for the same phonemes depending on the situation. For example, he used ''dh'' or ''d'' to represent the [[voiced dental fricative]] {{IPA|/ð/}} (English ''th'' in ''this'') and ''tz'' or ''z'' to represent the [[geminate]] [[voiceless dental fricative]] {{IPA|/θ/}} (the ''th'' in ''thin''). Additionally, Agricola might use ''gh'' or ''g'' to represent the [[voiced velar fricative]] {{IPA|/ɣ/}} and either ''ch'', ''c'' or ''h'' for {{IPA|/h/}}. For example, he wrote ''techtin'' against modern spelling ''tehtiin''.

Others revised Agricola's work later, striving for a more phonemic system. Along the way, Finnish lost some of its phonemes. The sounds {{IPA|/ð/}} and {{IPA|/θ/}} disappeared from the standard language, surviving only in a small rural region in Western Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=613 |title=Eurajoen murre |accessdate=2007-07-11 |author=Rekunen, Jorma |author2=Yli-Luukko, Eeva|author3=Jaakko Yli-Paavola |date=2007-03-19|work=Kauden murre (online publication: samples of Finnish dialects) |publisher=Kotus (The Research Institute for the Languages of Finland)|language=Finnish|quote="θ on sama äänne kuin th englannin sanassa thing. ð sama äänne kuin th englannin sanassa this.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, traces of these phonemes persist as their disappearance gave Finnish dialects their distinct qualities. For example, {{IPA|/θ/}} became ''ht'' or ''tt'' (e.g. meþþä → mehtä, mettä) in the eastern dialects and in some western dialects. In the standard language, however, the effect of the lost phonemes is thus:
*{{IPA|/ð/}} became {{IPA|/d/}}
*{{IPA|/θ/}} became {{IPA|/ts/}}
*{{IPA|/ɣ/}} became {{IPA|/v/}} but only if the {{IPA|/ɣ/}} appeared originally between high labial vowels /u/ and /y/, otherwise lost entirely (cf. ''suku'' 'kin, family' : ''suvun'' [genitive form] from earlier *suku : *suɣun, and ''kyky'' : ''kyvyn'' 'ability, skill' [nominative and genitive, respectively] from *kükü : *küɣün, contrasting with ''sika'' : ''sian'' 'pig, pork' [nominative and genitive] from *sika : *siɣan). (A similar process explains the /f/ pronunciation for some English words with "gh", such as "tough".)

Modern Finnish punctuation, along with that of Swedish, uses the [[colon (punctuation)|colon character]] to separate the stem of the word and its grammatical ending in some cases (such as after abbreviations), where some other alphabetic writing systems would use an apostrophe. Suffixes are required for correct grammar, so this is often applied, e.g. ''EU:ssa'' "in the EU".

===Modernization===
In the 19th century [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman]] and others began to stress the need to improve the status of Finnish. Ever since the days of Mikael Agricola, written Finnish had been used almost exclusively in religious contexts, but now Snellman's [[Hegel]]ian [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] ideas of Finnish as a fully-fledged national language gained considerable support. Concerted efforts were made to improve the status of the language and to modernize it, and by the end of the century Finnish had become a language of administration, journalism, literature, and science in Finland, along with Swedish.

The most important contributions to improving the status of Finnish were made by [[Elias Lönnrot]]. His impact on the development of modern vocabulary in Finnish was particularly important. In addition to compiling the ''[[Kalevala]]'', he acted as an arbiter in disputes about the development of standard Finnish between the proponents of western and eastern dialects, ensuring that the western dialects Agricola had preferred preserved their preeminent role, while many originally dialect words from Eastern Finland were introduced to the standard language, enriching it considerably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kuusi |first=Matti |author2=Anttonen Pertti |title= Kalevala-lipas |publisher= SKS, [[Finnish Literature Society]] |year= 1985 |isbn= 951-717-380-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first novel written in Finnish (and by a Finnish speaker) was ''[[Seven Brothers]]'' (''Seitsemän veljestä''), published by [[Aleksis Kivi]] in 1870.

===Future===
The Finnish language has been changing in certain ways after [[World War II]], which has been observed in the spreading of certain dialectal features (for example the spread of Western allophone of the cluster ts (mettä: mettän/metän (forest: forest's) instead of metsä) and the Eastern disappearance of d-sound (tiän/tiij(j)än ((i) know)) instead of the Western allophones) and the simultaneous preference to abandon the more visible dialectal features. Some scientists{{who?|date=October 2018}} have also reported the moving of the ä-sound towards the a-sound, even theorising that the Finnish speakers would start to pronounce the a-sound even more distantly from the changing ä-sound in order to preserve vowel harmony.

==Dialects==
[[File:FinnishDialects.png|thumb|upright=1.47|left|Map of Finnish dialects]]

The dialects of Finnish are divided into two distinct groups, Western and Eastern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetix.ofw.fi/opinnot/opintojaksot/8kieletkirjallisuus/aidinkieli/murteet/|title= Suomen murteet|accessdate=2008-01-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010503/http://www.internetix.ofw.fi/opinnot/opintojaksot/8kieletkirjallisuus/aidinkieli/murteet/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialects are almost entirely mutually intelligible and are distinguished from each other by only minor changes in vowels, diphthongs and rhythm. For the most part, the dialects operate on the same phonology, grammar and vocabulary. There are only marginal examples of sounds or grammatical constructions specific to some dialect and not found in standard Finnish. Two examples are the [[voiced dental fricative]] found in the [[Rauma dialect]], and the Eastern [[exessive case]].

The classification of closely related dialects spoken outside Finland is a politically sensitive issue that has been controversial since Finland's independence in 1917. This concerns specifically the [[Karelian language]] in Russia and [[Meänkieli]] in Sweden, the speakers of which are often considered oppressed minorities. Karelian is different enough from standard Finnish to have its own orthography. Meänkieli is a northern dialect entirely intelligible to speakers of any other Finnish dialect, which achieved its status as an official minority language in Sweden for historical and political reasons, although Finnish is an official minority language in Sweden, too.

===Western dialects===
The Southwestern dialects (''lounaismurteet'') are spoken in [[Southwest Finland]] and [[Satakunta (region)|Satakunta]]. Their typical feature is abbreviation of word-final vowels, and in many respects they resemble [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. The Tavastian dialects (''hämäläismurteet'') are spoken in [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]]. They are closest to the standard language, but feature some slight vowel changes, such as the opening of diphthong-final vowels (''tie → tiä'', ''miekka → miakka'', ''kuolisi → kualis''), the change of d to l (mostly obsolete) or trilled r (widespread, nowadays disappearance of d is popular) and the personal pronouns (me:meitin (we: our), te:teitin (you:your) and he: heitin (they: their)). The Southern Ostrobothnian dialects (''eteläpohjalaiset murteet'') are spoken in [[Southern Ostrobothnia]]. Their most notable feature is the pronunciation of 'd' as a tapped or even fully trilled {{IPA|/r/}}. The Middle and North Ostrobothnia dialects (''keski- ja pohjoispohjalaiset murteet'') are spoken in [[Central Ostrobothnia|Central]] and [[Northern Ostrobothnia]]. The Far Northern dialects (''peräpohjalaiset murteet'') are spoken in [[Lapland, Finland|Lapland]]. The dialects spoken in the western parts of Lapland are recognizable by retention of old 'h' sounds in positions where they have disappeared from other dialects.

One of the Far Northern dialects, [[Meänkieli]], which is spoken on the Swedish side of the border, is taught in some Swedish schools as a distinct [[standard language|standardized language]]. The speakers of Meänkieli became politically separated from the other Finns when Finland was [[Finnish War|annexed]] to Russia in 1809. The categorization of Meänkieli as a separate language is controversial among the Finns, who see no linguistic criteria, only political reasons, for treating Meänkieli differently from other dialects of Finnish.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

The [[Kven language]] is spoken in [[Finnmark]] and [[Troms]], in Norway. Its speakers are descendants of Finnish emigrants to the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Kven language|Kven]] is an official minority language in Norway.

===Eastern dialects===
{{Main article|East Finnish}}
The Eastern dialects consist of the widespread Savonian dialects (''savolaismurteet'') spoken in [[Savonia (historical province)|Savo]] and nearby areas, and the South-Eastern dialects now spoken only in Finnish [[South Karelia]]. The South-Eastern dialects (''kaakkoismurteet'') were previously also spoken on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] and in [[Ingria]]. The Karelian Isthmus was evacuated during [[World War II]] and refugees were resettled all over Finland. Most [[Ingrian Finns]] were [[Deportations of the Ingrian Finns|deported]] to various interior areas of the Soviet Union.

[[Palatalization (phonetics)|Palatalization]], a common feature of Uralic languages, had been lost in the Finnic branch, but it has been reacquired by most of these languages, including Eastern Finnish, but not Western Finnish. In Finnish orthography, this is denoted with a 'j', e.g. ''vesj'' [vesʲ] 'water', cf. standard ''vesi''.

The language spoken in those parts of Karelia that have not historically been under Swedish or Finnish rule is usually called the [[Karelian language]], and it is considered to be more distant from standard Finnish than the Eastern dialects. Whether this language of [[Russian Karelia]] is a dialect of Finnish or a separate language is a matter of interpretation. However, the term "Karelian dialects" is often used colloquially for the Finnish South-Eastern dialects.

==Linguistic varieties==
{{Refimprove|date=October 2009}}
There are two main [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of Finnish used throughout the country. One is the "standard language" (''yleiskieli''), and the other is the "spoken language" (''puhekieli''). The standard language is used in formal situations like political speeches and newscasts. Its written form, the "book language" (''kirjakieli''), is used in nearly all written texts, not always excluding even the dialogue of common people in popular prose. The spoken language, on the other hand, is the main variety of Finnish used in popular TV and radio shows and at workplaces, and may be preferred to a dialect in personal communication.

===Standardization===
Standard Finnish is prescribed by the Language Office of the [[Research Institute for the Languages of Finland]] and is the language used in official communication. [[Nykysuomen sanakirja|The Dictionary of Contemporary Finnish]] (''Nykysuomen sanakirja'' 1951–61), with 201,000 entries, was a [[prescriptive]] dictionary that defined official language. An additional volume for words of foreign origin (''Nykysuomen sivistyssanakirja'', 30,000 entries) was published in 1991. An updated dictionary, [[The New Dictionary of Modern Finnish]] (''Kielitoimiston sanakirja'') was published in an electronic form in 2004 and in print in 2006. A [[descriptive]] grammar (''[[Iso suomen kielioppi]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Hakulinen, Auli et al. (2004): Iso suomen kielioppi. SKS:n toimituksia 950. Helsinki: Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura. {{ISBN|951-746-557-2}}. 1,600 pages&lt;/ref&gt; 1,600 pages) was published in 2004. There is also an etymological dictionary, ''Suomen sanojen alkuperä'', published in 1992–2000, and a handbook of contemporary language (''Nykysuomen käsikirja''), and a periodic publication, ''Kielikello''. Standard Finnish is used in official texts and is the form of language taught in schools. Its spoken form is used in political speech, newscasts, in courts, and in other formal situations. Nearly all publishing and printed works are in standard Finnish.

===Colloquial Finnish===
{{main article|Colloquial Finnish}}
The colloquial language has mostly developed naturally from earlier forms of Finnish, and spread from the main cultural and political centres. The standard language, however, has always been a consciously constructed medium for literature. It preserves grammatical patterns that have mostly vanished from the colloquial varieties and, as its main application is writing, it features complex syntactic patterns that are not easy to handle when used in speech. The colloquial language develops significantly faster, and the grammatical and phonological simplifications also include the most common pronouns and suffixes, which amount to frequent but modest differences. Some sound changes have been left out of the formal language, such as the irregularization of some common verbs by assimilation, e.g. ''tule-'' → ''tuu-'' ('come', only when the second syllable is short, so the third person singular does not contract: ''hän tulee'' 'he comes', never *''hän tuu''; also ''mene-'' → ''mee-''). However, the longer forms such as ''tule'' can be used in spoken language in other forms as well.

The literary language certainly still exerts a considerable influence upon the spoken word, because illiteracy is nonexistent and many Finns are avid readers. In fact, it is still not entirely uncommon to meet people who "talk book-ish" (''puhuvat kirjakieltä''); it may have connotations of pedantry, exaggeration, moderation, weaseling or sarcasm (somewhat like heavy use of Latinate words in English: compare the difference between saying "There's no children I'll leave it to" and "There are no children to whom I shall leave it".). More common is the intrusion of typically literary constructions into a colloquial discourse, as a kind of quote from written Finnish. It should also be noted that it is quite common to hear book-like and polished speech on radio or TV, and the constant exposure to such language tends to lead to the adoption of such constructions even in everyday language.

A prominent example of the effect of the standard language is the development of the consonant gradation form /ts : ts/ as in ''metsä : metsän'', as this pattern was originally (1940) found natively only in the dialects of the southern Karelian isthmus and [[Ingria]]. It has been reinforced by the spelling 'ts' for the dental fricative {{IPA|[θː]}}, used earlier in some western dialects. The spelling and the pronunciation this encourages however approximate the original pronunciation, still reflected in e.g. [[Karelian language|Karelian]] /čč : č/ (''meččä : mečän''). In the spoken language, a fusion of Western /tt : tt/ (''mettä : mettän'') and Eastern /ht : t/ (''mehtä : metän'') has resulted: /tt : t/ (''mettä : metän'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetix.ofw.fi/opinnot/opintojaksot/8kieletkirjallisuus/aidinkieli/murteet/ts-vasti.html Yleiskielen ts:n murrevastineet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010530/http://www.internetix.ofw.fi/opinnot/opintojaksot/8kieletkirjallisuus/aidinkieli/murteet/ts-vasti.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that neither of these forms are identifiable as, or originate from, a specific dialect.

The orthography of informal language follows that of the formal. However, in signalling the former in writing, [[Syncope (phonology)|syncope]] and [[sandhi]] – especially internal – may occasionally amongst other characteristics be transcribed, e.g. ''menenpä'' → ''me(n)empä''. This never occurs in the standard variety.

==Phonology==
{{Main article|Finnish phonology}}

=== Segmental phonology ===
The phoneme inventory of Finnish is moderately large&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wals.info/chapter/1|title=WALS|last=|first=|date=|website=WALS Database|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with a great number of vocalic segments and a restricted set of consonant types, both of which can be long or short. 

==== Vocalic segments ====
Finnish monophthongs show eight vowels qualities that contrast in duration, thus 16 vowel phonemes in total. [[Allophony]] is restricted. Vowel phonemes are always contrastive in word-initial syllables; for noninitial syllable, see [[morphophonology]] below. [[Mid vowel|Mid vowels]] tend to be open-mid. Long and short vowels are shown below.

|}

The usual analysis is that Finnish has long and short vowels and consonants as distinct phonemes. However, long vowels may be analyzed as a vowel followed by a [[chroneme]], or also, that sequences of identical vowels are pronounced as "diphthongs". The quality of long vowels mostly overlaps with the quality of short vowels, with the exception of '''u''', which is centralized with respect to '''uu'''; long vowels do not morph into [[diphthong]]s. There are eighteen phonemic diphthongs; like vowels, diphthongs do not have significant allophony.

==== Consonants ====
Finnish has a consonant inventory of small to moderate size, where voicing is mostly not distinctive, and fricatives are scarce. Finnish has relatively few non-[[coronal consonant]]s. Consonants are as follows, where consonants in parenthesis are found only in a few recent loans, and may be mispronounced by uneducated speakers.

{{reflist|group=note}}

Almost all consonants have phonemic short and long ([[geminate]]d) forms, although length is only constrastive in consonants word-medially.

Consonant clusters are mostly absent in native Finnish words, except for a small set of two-consonant sequences in [[syllable coda]]s, e.g. 'rs' in ''karsta''. However, because of a number of recently adopted loanwords that have them, e.g. ''strutsi'' from Swedish ''struts'', meaning "ostrich", clusters have been integrated to the modern language to different degrees.

Finnish is somewhat divergent from other Uralic languages in two respects: it has lost most fricatives, as well as losing the distinction between  [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] and non-palatalized consonants. Finnish has only two fricatives in native words, namely {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/h/}}. All other fricatives are recognized as foreign, of which Finnish speakers can usually reliably distinguish {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}}. (The official alphabet includes 'z' [z] and 'ž' [ʒ], but these are rarely used correctly, including by the Swedish-speakers, who also struggle with those sounds.) [[Palatalization (phonetics)|Palatalization]] is characteristic of Uralic languages, but Finnish has lost it. However, the Eastern dialects and the Karelian language have redeveloped a system of palatalization. For example, the [[Karelian language|Karelian]] word ''d'uuri'' {{IPA|[dʲuːri]}}, with a palatalized {{IPA|/dʲ/}}, is reflected by ''juuri'' in Finnish and [[Savo dialect]] ''vesj'' {{IPA|[vesʲ]}} is ''vesi'' in standard Finnish.

A feature of Finnic phonology is the development of labial and rounded vowels in non-initial syllables, as in the word ''tyttö''. [[Proto-Uralic]] had only 'a' and 'i' and their vowel harmonic allophones in non-initial syllables; modern Finnish allows other vowels in non-initial syllables, although they are uncommon compared to 'a', 'ä' and 'i'.

=== Prosody ===
Characteristic features of Finnish (common to some other Uralic languages) are [[vowel harmony]] and an [[agglutinative]] morphology; owing to the extensive use of the latter, words can be quite long.

The main stress is always on the first syllable, and it is articulated by adding approximately 100 ms more length to the stressed vowel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirmse|first=U|author2=Ylinen, S|author3=Tervaniemi, M|author4=Vainio, M|author5=Schröger, E|author6=Jacobsen, T|year=2008|title=Modulation of the mismatch negativity (MMN) to vowel duration changes in native speakers of Finnish and German as a result of language experience.|journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology|volume=67|issue=2|pages=131–143|doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2007.10.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress does not cause any measurable modifications in vowel quality (very much unlike English). However, stress is not strong and words appear evenly stressed. In some cases, stress is so weak that the highest points of volume, pitch and other indicators of "articulation intensity" are not on the first syllable, although native speakers recognize the first syllable as a stressed syllable.

==Morphophonology==
{{further|Finnish consonant gradation}}

Finnish has several morphophonological processes that require modification of the forms of words for daily speech. The most important processes are [[vowel harmony]] and [[consonant gradation]].

Vowel harmony is a redundancy feature, which means that the feature [±back] is uniform within a word, and so it is necessary to interpret it only once for a given word. It is meaning-distinguishing in the initial syllable, and suffixes follow; so, if the listener hears [±back] in any part of the word, they can derive [±back] for the initial syllable. For example, from the stem ''tuote'' ("product") one derives ''t'''uo'''tteeseens'''a''''' ("into his product"), where the final vowel becomes the back vowel 'a' (rather than the front vowel 'ä') because the initial syllable contains the back vowels 'uo'. This is especially notable because vowels 'a' and 'ä' are different, meaning-distinguishing [[phoneme]]s, not interchangeable or [[Allophone|allophonic]]. Finnish front vowels are not [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]]s.

Consonant gradation is a partly nonproductive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Valma|last=Yli-Vakkuri|title=Onko suomen kielen astevaihtelu epäproduktiivinen jäänne?|journal=Sananjalka|issue=18|year=1976|publisher=Suomen kielen seura|url=http://www.suomenkielenseura.fi/wp-content/uploads/sj18_053-069_yli-vakkuri.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[lenition]] process for P, T and K in inherited vocabulary, with the oblique stem "weakened" from the nominative stem, or vice versa. For example, ''tar'''kk'''a'' "precise" has the oblique stem ''tar'''k'''a-'', as in ''tarkan'' "of the precise". There is also another gradation pattern, which is older, and causes simple elision of T and K in suffixes. However, it is very common since it is found in the partitive case marker: if V is a single vowel, V+''ta'' → Va, e.g. *''tarkka+ta'' → ''tarkkaa''.

==Grammar==
{{Main article|Finnish grammar}}
Finnish is a [[synthetic language]] that employs extensive regular [[agglutination]] of modifiers to verbs, nouns, adjectives and numerals. However, Finnish is not a [[polysynthetic language]], although [[Non-finite clause|non-finite dependent clause]]s may be contracted to infinitives (''lauseenvastike'', e.g. ''juode·ssa·ni'' "when I was drinking", lit. "drink-in-I", that is "during my drinking").

The [[morphosyntactic alignment]] is nominative–accusative; but there are two object cases: accusative and partitive. The contrast between the two is [[telicity|telic]], where the accusative case denotes actions completed as intended (''Ammuin hirven'' "I shot (killed) the elk"), and the partitive case denotes incomplete actions (''Ammuin hirveä'' "I shot (at) the elk"). Often this is confused with [[perfective aspect|perfectivity]], but the only element of perfectivity that exists in Finnish is that there are some perfective verbs. Transitivity is distinguished by different verbs for transitive and intransitive, e.g. ''ratkaista'' "to solve something" vs. ''ratketa'' "to solve by itself". There are several [[frequentative]] and [[momentane]] verb categories.

Verbs gain personal suffixes for each person; these suffixes are grammatically more important than pronouns, which are often not used at all in standard Finnish. The infinitive is not the uninflected form but has a suffix ''-ta'' or ''-da''; the closest one to an uninflected form is the third person singular indicative. There are four persons, first ("I, we"), second ("you (singular), you (plural)"), third ("s/he, they"). The passive voice (sometimes called impersonal or indefinite) resembles a "fourth person" similar to, e.g., English "people say/do/...". There are four tenses, namely present, past, perfect and pluperfect; the system mirrors the Germanic system. The future tense is not needed, because of context and the telic contrast. For example, ''luen kirjan'' "I read a book (completely)" indicates a future, when ''luen kirjaa'' "I read a book (not yet complete)" indicates present.

Nouns may be suffixed with the markers for the aforementioned [[accusative case]] and [[partitive case]], the [[genitive case]], eight different [[Finnish locative system|locatives]], and a few other cases. The case marker must be added not only to the main noun, but also to its modifiers; e.g. ''suure+ssa talo+ssa'', literally "big-in house-in". Possession is marked with a [[possessive suffix]]; separate [[possessive pronoun]]s are unknown. Pronouns gain suffixes just as nouns do.

==Lexicon==
[[File:Suomalaisen Sana-Lugun Coetus.jpg|thumb|''[[Suomalaisen Sana-Lugun Coetus]]'' (1745) by [[Daniel Juslenius]] was the first comprehensive dictionary of the Finnish language with 16,000 entries.]]

:''See the lists of [[Wiktionary:Category:Finnish language|Finnish words]] and [[Wiktionary:Category:Finnish derivations|words of Finnish origin]] at [[Wiktionary]], the free dictionary and Wikipedia's sibling project.''

Finnish has a smaller core vocabulary than, for example, English, and uses derivative suffixes to a greater extent. As an example, take the word ''kirja'' "a book", from which one can form derivatives ''kirjain'' "a letter" (of the [[alphabet]]), ''kirje'' "a piece of correspondence, a letter", ''kirjasto'' "a library", ''kirjailija'' "an author", ''kirjallisuus'' "literature", ''kirjoittaa'' "to write", ''kirjoittaja'' "a writer", ''kirjuri'' "a scribe, a clerk", ''kirjallinen'' "in written form", ''kirjata'' "to write down, register, record", ''kirjasin'' "a font", and many others.

Here are some of the more common such suffixes. Which of each pair is used depends on the word being suffixed in accordance with the rules of [[vowel harmony]].
*-''ja/jä'' : agent (one who does) (e.g. ''lukea'' "to read" → ''lukija'' "reader")
*''-lainen/läinen'': inhabitant of (either noun or adjective). ''Englanti'' "England" → ''englantilainen'' "English person or thing"; ''Venäjä'' → ''venäläinen'' "Russian person or thing".
*''-sto/stö'': collection of. For example: ''kirja'' "a book" → ''kirjasto'' "a library"; ''laiva'' "a ship" → ''laivasto'' "navy, fleet".
*''-in'': instrument or tool. For example: ''kirjata'' "to book, to file" → ''kirjain'' "a letter" (of the alphabet); ''vatkata'' "to whisk" → ''vatkain'' "a whisk, mixer".
*''-uri/yri'': an agent or instrument (''kaivaa'' "to dig" → ''kaivuri'' "an excavator"; ''laiva'' "a ship" → ''laivuri'' "shipper, shipmaster").
*''-os/ös'': result of some action (''tulla'' "to come" → ''tulos'' "result, outcome"; ''tehdä'' "to do" → ''teos'' "a piece of work").
*''-ton/tön'': lack of something, "un-", "-less" (''onni'' "happiness" → ''onneton'' "unhappy"; ''koti'' "home" → ''koditon'' "homeless").
*''-llinen'': having (the quality of) something (''lapsi'' "a child" → ''lapsellinen'' "childish"; ''kauppa'' "a shop, commerce" → ''kaupallinen'' "commercial").
*''-kas/käs'': similar to ''-llinen'' (''itse'' "self" → ''itsekäs'' "selfish"; ''neuvo'' "advice" → ''neuvokas'' "resourceful").
*''-va/vä'': doing or having something (''taitaa'' "to be able" → ''taitava'' "skillful"; ''johtaa'' "to lead" → ''johtava'' "leading").
*''-la/lä'': a place related to the main word (''kana'' "a hen" → ''kanala'' "a henhouse"; ''pappi'' "a priest" → ''pappila'' "a parsonage").

Verbal derivational suffixes are extremely diverse; several [[frequentative]]s and [[momentane]]s differentiating [[causative]], volitional-unpredictable and [[anticausative]] are found, often combined with each other, often denoting indirection. For example, ''hypätä'' "to jump", ''hyppiä'' "to be jumping", ''hypeksiä'' "to be jumping wantonly", ''hypäyttää'' "to make someone jump once", ''hyppyyttää'' "to make someone jump repeatedly" (or "to boss someone around"), ''hyppyytyttää'' "to make someone to cause a third person to jump repeatedly", ''hyppyytellä'' "to, without aim, make someone jump repeatedly", ''hypähtää'' "to jump suddenly" (in [[anticausative]] meaning), ''hypellä'' "to jump around repeatedly", ''hypiskellä'' "to be jumping repeatedly and wantonly". [[Caritive]]s are also used in such examples as ''hyppimättä'' "without jumping" and ''hyppelemättä'' "without jumping around". The diversity and compactness of both derivation and inflectional agglutination can be illustrated with ''istahtaisinkohan'' "I wonder if I should sit down for a while" (from ''istua'', "to sit, to be seated"):
*''istua'' "to sit down" (''istun'' "I sit down")
*''istahtaa'' "to sit down for a while"
*''istahdan'' "I'll sit down for a while"
*''istahtaisin'' "I would sit down for a while"
*''istahtaisinko'' "should I sit down for a while?"
*''istahtaisinkohan'' "I wonder if I should sit down for a while"
&lt;!-- Plenty more to add ...--&gt;

===Borrowing===
Over the course of many centuries, the Finnish language has borrowed many words from a wide variety of languages, most from neighbouring [[Indo-European languages]]. Indeed, some estimates put the core Proto-Uralic vocabulary surviving in Finnish at only around 300 word roots.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Owing to the different grammatical, phonological and phonotactic structure of the Finnish language, loanwords from Indo-European have been assimilated.

In general, the first loan words into Uralic languages seem to come from very early [[Indo-European languages]]. Later important sources have been, depending on the language, [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], and [[Slavic languages]]. Finnic languages, including Finnish, have borrowed in particular from Baltic and Germanic languages, and to a lesser extent from Slavic and Indo-Iranian languages. Furthermore, a certain group of very basic and neutral words exists in Finnish and other Finnic languages that are absent from other Uralic languages, but without a recognizable etymology from any known language. These words are usually regarded{{Who|date=April 2010}} as the last remnant of the [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Paleo-European]] language spoken in Fennoscandia before the arrival of the proto-Finnic language.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Words included in this group are e.g. ''jänis'' (hare), ''musta'' (black), ''mäki'' (hill), ''saari'' (island), ''suo'' (swamp) and ''niemi'' (cape (geography)).

Also some place names, like [[Päijänne]] and [[Imatra]], are probably from before the proto-Finnic era.&lt;ref&gt;Häkkinen, Kaisa. ''Suomalaisten esihistoria kielitieteen valossa'' ({{ISBN|951-717-855-7}}). Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seura 1996. See pages 166 and 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often quoted loan examples are ''kuningas'' "king" and ''ruhtinas'' "[[prince|sovereign prince]], high ranking nobleman" from Germanic ''*kuningaz'' and ''*druhtinaz''—they display a remarkable tendency towards phonological conservation within the language. Another example is ''äiti'' "mother", from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''aiþei'', which is interesting because borrowing of close-kinship vocabulary is a rare phenomenon. The original Finnish ''emo'' occurs only in restricted contexts. There are other close-kinship words that are loaned from Baltic and Germanic languages (''morsian'' "bride", ''armas'' "dear", ''huora'' "whore"). Examples of the ancient Iranian loans are ''vasara'' "hammer" from [[Avestan]] ''vadžra'', ''vajra'' and ''orja'' "slave" from ''[[Aryan|arya]]'', ''airya'' "man" (the latter probably via similar circumstances as ''slave'' from [[Slavic peoples|Slav]] in many European languages{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}).

More recently, Swedish has been a prolific source of borrowings, and also, the [[Swedish language]] acted as a proxy for European words, especially those relating to government. Present-day Finland was a part of Sweden from the 12th century and was ceded to Russia in 1809, becoming an autonomous Grand Duchy. Swedish was retained as the official language and language of the upper class even after this. When Finnish was accepted as an official language, it gained legal equal status with Swedish. During the period of autonomy, Russian did not gain much ground as a language of the people or the government. Nevertheless, quite a few words were subsequently acquired from [[Russian language|Russian]] (especially in older [[Helsinki slang]]) but not to the same extent as with Swedish. In all these cases, borrowing has been partly a result of geographical proximity.

Especially words dealing with administrative or modern culture came to Finnish from Swedish, sometimes reflecting the oldest Swedish form of the word (''lag''&amp;nbsp;– ''laki'', 'law'; ''län''&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Provinces of Finland|lääni]]'', 'province'; ''bisp''&amp;nbsp;– ''piispa'', 'bishop'; ''jordpäron''&amp;nbsp;– ''peruna'', 'potato'), and many more survive as informal synonyms in spoken or dialectal Finnish (e.g. ''likka'', from Swedish ''flicka'', 'girl', usually ''tyttö'' in Finnish).

Typical Russian loanwords are old or very old, thus hard to recognize as such, and concern everyday concepts, e.g. ''papu'' "bean", ''sini'' "([[Noun|n.]]) blue" and ''pappi'' "priest". Notably, a few religious words such as ''Raamattu'' ("Bible") are borrowed from Russian, which indicates language contact preceding the Swedish era. This is mainly believed to be result of trade with Novgorod from the 9th century on and [[Russian Orthodox]] [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]]s in the east in the 13th century.

Most recently, and with increasing impact, English has been the source of new [[loanword]]s in Finnish. Unlike previous geographical borrowing, the influence of English is largely cultural and reaches Finland by many routes, including international business, music, film and TV (foreign films and programmes, excluding ones intended for a very young audience, are shown subtitled), literature, and the [[World Wide Web|Web]]&amp;nbsp;– the latter is now probably the most important source of all non-face-to-face exposure to English.

The importance of English as the language of global commerce has led many non-English companies, including Finland's [[Nokia]], to adopt English as their official operating language. Recently, it has been observed that English borrowings are also ousting previous borrowings, for example the switch from ''treffailla'' "to date" (from Swedish, ''träffa'') to ''deittailla'' from English "to go for a date". [[Calque]]s from English are also found, e.g. ''kovalevy'' (hard disk). Grammatical calques are also found, for example, the replacement of the impersonal (''passiivi'') with the English-style [[generic you]], e. g. ''sä et voi'' "you cannot", instead of ''ei voi'' "one cannot". This construct, however, is limited to colloquial language, as it is against the standard grammar.

However, this does not mean that Finnish is threatened by English. Borrowing is normal language evolution, and neologisms are coined actively not only by the government, but also by the media. Moreover, Finnish and English have a considerably different [[Finnish grammar|grammar]], [[Finnish phonology|phonology]] and [[Finnish phonotactics|phonotactics]], discouraging direct borrowing. English loan words in Finnish slang include for example ''pleikkari'' "PlayStation", ''hodari'' "hot dog", and ''hedari'' "headache", "headshot" or "headbutt". Often these loanwords are distinctly identified as [[slang]] or [[jargon]], rarely being used in a negative mood or in formal language. Since English and Finnish grammar, pronunciation and phonetics differ considerably, most loan words are inevitably sooner or later [[calque]]d&amp;nbsp;– translated into native Finnish&amp;nbsp;– retaining the semantic meaning.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Neologisms===
Some modern terms have been synthesised rather than borrowed, for example:
:''puhelin'' "telephone" (from the stem "puhel-" "talk"+ instrument suffix "-in" to make "an instrument for talking")
:''tietokone'' "computer" (literally: "knowledge machine" or "data machine")
:''levyke'' "diskette" (from ''levy'' "disc" + a diminutive ''-ke'')
:''sähköposti'' "email" (literally: "electric mail")
:''linja-auto'' "bus" (literally: route-car)
:''muovi'' "plastic" (from muovata "to form or model, e.g. from clay", from the stem muov+ suffix "-i" to make "a substance, material or element for modeling or forming". The suffix "-i" would correspond to the instrument suffix "-in", but instead of instrument in this case rather a substance, material or element that can be used.
Neologisms are actively generated by the Language Planning Office and the media. They are widely adopted. One would actually give an old-fashioned or rustic impression using forms such as ''kompuutteri (computer)'' or ''kalkulaattori (calculator)'' when the neologism is widely adopted.

==Orthography==
{{Main article|Finnish alphabet}}
[[File:Abckiria.jpg|thumb|upright=1.04|right|The first page of ''[[Abckiria]]'' (1543), the first book written in the Finnish language. The spelling of Finnish in the book had many inconsistencies: for example, the k sound could be represented by c, k or even g; the long u and the long i were represented by w and ij respectively, and ä was represented by e.]]
Finnish is written with the [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish variant of the Latin alphabet]] but with two more letters that are from some Russian loanwords. It includes the distinct characters Ä and Ö, and also several characters (b, c, f, q, w, x, z, å, š and ž) reserved for words of non-Finnish origin. The Finnish orthography follows the phoneme principle: each phoneme (meaningful sound) of the language corresponds to exactly one grapheme (independent letter), and each grapheme represents almost exactly one phoneme. This enables an easy spelling and facilitates reading and writing acquisition. The rule of thumb for Finnish orthography is: ''write as you read, read as you write''. However, morphemes retain their spelling despite [[sandhi]].

Some orthographical notes:
*Long vowels and consonants are represented by double occurrences of the relevant graphemes. This causes no confusion, and permits these sounds to be written without having to nearly double the size of the alphabet to accommodate separate graphemes for long sounds.
*The grapheme ''h'' is sounded slightly harder when placed before a consonant (initially [[breathy voice]]d, then voiceless) than before a vowel.
*[[Sandhi]] is not transcribed; the spelling of morphemes is immutable, e.g. ''tulen+pa'' {{IPA|/tulempa/}}.
*Some consonants (v, j, d) and all consonant clusters do not have distinctive length, and consequently, their allophonic variation is typically not specified in spelling, e.g. ''rajaan'' /rajaan/ (I limit) vs. ''raijaan'' /raijjaan/ (I haul).
*Pre-1900s texts and personal names use ''w'' for ''v''. Both correspond to the same phoneme, the [[labiodental approximant]] {{IPA|/ʋ/}}, a ''v'' without the fricative ("hissing") quality of the English ''v''.
*The letters ''[[ä]]'' {{IPA|[æ]}} and ''[[ö]]'' {{IPA|[ø]}}, although written as [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlauted]] ''a'' and ''o'', do not represent [[i-mutation|phonological umlauts]], and they are considered independent graphemes; the letter shapes have been copied from Swedish. An appropriate parallel from the Latin alphabet are the characters ''C'' and ''G'' (uppercase), which historically have a closer kinship than many other characters (''G'' is a derivation of ''C'') but are considered distinct letters, and changing one for the other will change meanings.

Although Finnish is almost completely written as it is spoken, there are a few differences:
* The ''n'' in ''nk'' is a [[velar nasal]], as in English. As an exception to the phonetic principle, there is no ''g'' in ''ng'', which is a long velar nasal as in English ''si'''ng'''along''.
* [[Sandhi]] phenomena such as the gemination between words or the change 'n+k' to [ŋk] is not marked in writing.
* The double consonant in clitic is marked as a single consonant.
* Only comparative and superlative adjectives the letter m is used like in speech in word like ''parempi'', but in other similar cases the letter n is used, like in ''onpa''
* The {{IPA|/j/}} after the letter ''i'' is very weak or there is no {{IPA|/j/}} at all, but in writing it is used; for example: ''urheilija''. Indeed, the ''j'' is not used in writing words with consonant gradation such as ''aion'' and ''läksiäiset''.
* In speech there is no difference between the use of {{IPA|/i/}} in words (like ''ajo'''i'''ttaa'', but ''ehdottaa''), but in writing there are quite simple rules: The i is written in forms derived from words that consist two syllables and end in an or ä (''sanoittaa'', "to write song-lyrics", from ''sana'', "word"), and in words that are old-stylish (''innoittaa''). The i is not written in forms derived from words that consist two syllables and end in o or ö (''erottaa'' "to discern, to differentiate" from ''ero'' difference), words which do not clearly derive from a single word (''hajottaa'' can be derived either from the stem ''haja-'' seen in such adverbs as ''hajalle'', or from the related verb ''hajota''), and in words that are descriptive (''häämöttää'') or workaday by their style (''rehottaa'')

When the appropriate characters are not available, the graphemes ''ä'' and ''ö'' are usually converted to ''a'' and ''o'', respectively. This is common in e-mail addresses and other electronic media where there may be no support for characters outside the basic [[ASCII]] character set. Writing them as ''ae'' and ''oe'', following German usage, is rarer and usually considered incorrect, but formally used in passports and equivalent situations. Both conversion rules have minimal pairs which would no longer be distinguished from each other.

The sounds ''š'' and ''ž'' are not a part of Finnish language itself and have been introduced by the Finnish national languages body for more phonologically accurate transcription of loanwords and foreign names. For technical reasons or convenience, the graphemes ''sh'' and ''zh'' are often used in quickly or less carefully written texts instead of ''š'' and ''ž''. This is a deviation from the phonetic principle, and as such is liable to cause confusion, but the damage is minimal as the transcribed words are foreign in any case. Finnish does not use the sounds ''z'', ''š'' or ''ž'', but for the sake of exactitude, they can be included in spelling. (The recommendation cites the Russian opera ''[[Khovanshchina|Hovanštšina]]'' as an example.) Many speakers pronounce all of them ''s'', or distinguish only between ''s'' and ''š'', because Finnish has no voiced sibilants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mlang.name/arkisto/hatut.html | title=Kirjaimet š ja ž suomen kielenoikeinkirjoituksessa | publisher=KOTUS | year=1998 | accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language may be identified by its distinctive lack of the letters ''b, c, f, q, w, x, z'' and ''å.''

¹ -te is added to make the sentence formal ([[T-V distinction]]). Otherwise, without the added "-te", it is informal. It is also added when talking to more than one person. The transition from second-person singular to second-person plural (''teitittely'') is a politeness pattern, advised by many "good manners guides". Elderly people, especially, expect it from strangers, whereas the younger might feel it to be too formal to the point of coldness. However, a learner of the language should not be excessively concerned about it. Omitting it is (almost) never offensive, but one should keep in mind that on formal occasions this custom may make a good impression.

==[[Phonaesthetics]] and influences==
[[J. R. R. Tolkien]], although better known as an author, had a keen interest in languages from a young age, and became a professional [[philologist]]. He described his first encounter with Finnish:
:"like discovering a complete wine-cellar fllled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before. It quite intoxicated me..."&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien (1981), ''[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]]'', George Allen &amp; Unwin, letter no. 163 (to [[W. H. Auden]], 7th June 1953), p. 214; {{ISBN|0-04-826005-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aspects of Finnish were a strong influence on [[Quenya]], one of the [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|languages constructed by Tolkien]]. Within his fantasy writings set in the world of [[Middle-earth]], Quenya is a highly-revered language.

'''Flavored fortified wines''' are inexpensive [[fortified wine]]s that typically have an alcohol content between 13% and 20% [[alcohol by volume|alcohol by volume (ABV)]]. They are usually made of grape and citrus wine, [[sugar]], and [[artificial flavor]]. 

==Brands==
* '''[[Buckfast Tonic Wine]]''' is a caffeine- and sugar-laced tonic wine with added alcohol, produced under license from [[Buckfast Abbey]], a Roman Catholic monastery located in [[Devon, England]]. It is very popular in [[Glasgow]], [[East Kilbride]], [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]], [[Coatbridge]] and other [[Strathclyde]] areas in Scotland, but critics have blamed it for being one cause of social problems in Scotland. Some have called it "Wreck the Hoose Juice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = BBC News Magazine&amp;nbsp;– Binge drinking&amp;nbsp;– the Benedictine connection | accessdate = 17 June 2010 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5381360.stm | date=26 September 2006 | first=Claire | last=Heald}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cisco''' is the [[Brand|brand name]] of a fortified wine produced by the [[Centerra Wine Company]] (a division of [[Constellation Brands]]) with varieties selling at 13.9%, 17.5%, and 19.5% alcohol by volume ([[ABV]]). Cisco has a syrupy consistency and sweet taste; because of its color and bottle shape, it is frequently mistaken for a [[wine cooler]]. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] required the company to put labels on their bottles stating that Cisco is not a wine cooler, to change the shape and color of their containers, and to recall their advertising slogan "Takes you by surprise"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/predawn/F93/cisco.txt |title=Canandaigua Wine Co.

*'''MD 20/20''' (often called by its nickname '''Mad Dog''') is an American fortified wine. MD 20/20 has an alcohol content that varies by flavor from 13% to 18% (with most of the 18% varieties discontinued, although Red Grape is reportedly available in 18% ABV). The '''MD''' actually stands for its producer: [[Mogen David]]. Originally, '''20/20''' stood for 20 oz @ 20% alcohol. Currently, '''MD 20/20''' is not sold in 20 oz bottles nor at 20% alcohol by volume.
*'''Richards Wild Irish Rose''' is an alcoholic beverage produced by Centerra Wine Company, which is part of the [[Constellation Brands]] organization. It was introduced in 1954 and currently sells about 2 million cases annually. The brand is available in 13.9% and 18% alcohol by volume.
*'''Solntsedar''' was a Soviet brand of low-end fortified wine, marketed as "[[port wine]]," infamous for many severe cases of poisoning. Its production was canceled after [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s anti-alcohol laws.
*Three popular brands in this category have been produced by the [[E &amp; J Gallo Winery]], and were a large part of that company's early success.
**'''Ripple''' was a fortified wine produced by E &amp; J Gallo Winery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epicurious.com/drinking/wine_dictionary/entry?id=6303 |title=  E &amp; J Gallo Winery |accessdate=  |work= The Wine Lover's Companion |publisher= Epicurious}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was popular in the [[United States]], particularly in the 1970s. Possessing a low 11% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]] (lower than modern table wines), it was originally marketed to "casual" drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drunkard.com/issues/55/55-dead-end-drinks.html  Modern Drunkard Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its low price, it had a reputation as a drink for [[alcoholic]]s and the destitute. It was popular among young drinkers, both [[Legal drinking age|underage]] and college students. It is no longer produced.
** '''Night Train Express,''' usually abbreviated to '''Night Train''', typically contains 17.5% ABV. Night Train Express has been condemned by some civic leaders who think inexpensive high alcohol content drinks contribute to [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] and [[public drunkenness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=AEP |accessdate=28 January 2010 |url=http://www.epi.umn.edu/alcohol/aeppolicy/about.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618044345/http://www.epi.umn.edu/alcohol/aeppolicy/about.asp |archivedate=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''Thunderbird''' (''The American Classic''), between 13% and 18% [[alcohol by volume|ABV]]. Popular since the 1950s, when a popular rhythm and blues song went: "What's the word? Thunderbird / How's it sold? Good and cold / What's the jive? 'Bird's alive / What's the price? Thirty twice."&lt;ref&gt;Adam Brown, "[http://www.cracked.com/article_16314_nectar-broke-worlds-5-worst-ways-get-drunk.html Nectar of the Broke: The World's 5 Worst Ways To Get Drunk]" ([[cracked.com]], June 9, 2009, accessed July 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Once marketed in the [[United Kingdom]] as "The California Aperitif."

==History==
An early reference to the problem of cheap and poorly made wines is in the "Report on Cheap Wines" in the 5 November 1864 issue of ''The Medical Times and Gazette''. The author, in prescribing inexpensive wines for a number of ills, cautions against the "fortified" wines of the day, describing of one sample that he had tried:
{{quote|When the cork was drawn it was scarcely tinted, and was a very bad one&amp;nbsp;– a thing of no good augury for the wine. There was no smell of port wine. The liquid, when tasted, gave the palate half-a-dozen sensations instead of one. There was a hot taste of spirits, a sweet taste, a fruity taste like [[damson]]s, and an unmistakable flavor of [[Grenache|Roussillon]] [an alternative name in France for wine made from the grape Grenache]. It was a strong, unwholesome liquor, purchased very dearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Report on Cheap Wines |journal=The Medical Times and Gazette |date=5 November 1864|page=547|url=https://archive.org/stream/medicaltimesand09unkngoog#page/n702/mode/2up|publisher=London, J. &amp; A. Churchill }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is reported, however, that the popularity of cheap, fortified wines in the United States arose in the 1930s, as a product of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] and the [[Great Depression]]:

{{quote|Prohibition produced the [[Roaring Twenties]] and fostered more [[beer]] and distilled-spirit drinkers than wine drinkers, because the raw materials were easier to come by. But fortified wine, or medicinal wine tonic—containing about 20 percent alcohol, which made it more like a distilled spirit than regular wine—was still available and became America's number one wine. Thunderbird and Wild Irish Rose, to name two examples, are fortified wines. American wine was soon more popular for its effect than its taste; in fact, the word wino came into use during the Depression to describe those unfortunate souls who turned to fortified wine to forget their troubles.|[[Kevin Zraly]], ''Kevin Zraly's American Wine Guide'' (2006) p. 38.}}

==Concerns and media attention==
While overtaken somewhat in the low-end alcoholic drink market by sweetened malt beverages by the 1990s, the appeal of cheap fortified wines to the poor and homeless has often raised concerns:

{{quote|Community groups in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland have urged makers of fortified wines such as Wild Irish Rose and E &amp; J Gallo's Thunderbird and Night Train brands to pull their products from the shelves of liquor retailers in [[skid row]] areas. In [[Nashville, Tennessee]], one liquor store owner told ''[[Nashville Business Journal]]'' reporter Julie Hinds that police warned him to stop selling his biggest selling product, Wild Irish Rose, because it encouraged homeless people to linger in the area.|Janice Jorgensen, ''Encyclopedia of Consumer Brands: Consumable Products'' (1993), p. 492.}}

In 2005, the [[Seattle]] City Council asked the [[Washington State Liquor Control Board]] to prohibit the sale of certain alcohol products in an impoverished "Alcohol Impact Area". Among the products sought to be banned were over two dozen beers, and six wines: Cisco, Gino's Premium Blend, MD 20/20, Night Train, Thunderbird, and Wild Irish Rose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  news|author=Hector Castro |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/251134_alcohol07.html |title=City could soon widen alcohol impact areas |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=7 December 2005 }} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Liquor Control Board approved these restrictions on 30 August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/aia/ Alcohol Impact Area Information and Updates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012023049/http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/aia/ |date=2013-10-12 }}, City of Seattle website.&lt;/ref&gt; The cities of [[Tacoma, Washington]] and [[Spokane, Washington]] also followed suit in instituting "Alcohol Impact Areas" of their own following Seattle's example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liq.wa.gov/pressreleases/080716 |title=Tacoma Alcohol Impact Area Press Release |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320082601/http://liq.wa.gov/pressreleases/080716 |archivedate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liq.wa.gov/pressreleases/spokaiarelease |title=Spokane Alcohol Impact Area Press Release |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320082539/http://liq.wa.gov/pressreleases/spokaiarelease |archivedate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Flavored fortified wines have appeared in numerous songs as well as other media forms.

===Films===
* Night Train made an appearance in ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), wherein it caused [[Joliet Jake|Jake's]] head to hurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluesbrotherscentral.com/forum/topic/3202-my-head-hurtsthat-night-trains-a-mean-wine/ | title=My Head Hurts..That Night Train's A Mean Wine|work=bluesbrotherscentral.com |date=22 November 2006 |accessdate = 7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Creepshow]]'' (1982), [[Stephen King]]'s character "Jordy Verrill" can be seen drinking Ripple wine. 
* The 1994 feature film ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' featured a scene in which Forrest Gump ([[Tom Hanks]]), is told by Lt. Dan Taylor ([[Gary Sinise]]) shortly after they meet for the first time after their military service, telling him to go get a bottle of Ripple.
* In the 1996 film ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', the character Begbie is seen drinking a bottle of Thunderbird on a bus.
* In the 1984 film [[Top_Secret!|Top Secret!]], Nick Rivers ([[Val_Kilmer|Val Kilmer]]) is served "Ripple Blanc" in a fancy restaurant, which dissolves the wine glass shortly after being poured.

===Literature===
* [[Beat Generation]] author [[Jack Kerouac]] recounted in ''[[Lonesome Traveler]]'' (1960) trading a [[hobo]] a bottle of Thunderbird wine for an interview about his experiences.
*In [[Junot Díaz]]'s [[The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao]], Yunior recalls Cisco's popularity during the 80s and 90s, remarking "Liquid crack, they used to call it".
*In [[Tom Robbins]]' [[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (novel)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]], Sissy Hankshaw commonly drinks Ripple.

===Television===
* The TV series ''[[Sanford &amp; Son]]'' often referred to Ripple, as it was [[Fred G. Sanford|Fred Sanford]]'s alcoholic beverage of choice.&lt;ref name="charlotte"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=the Charlotte Observer|accessdate=10 October 2007|title=The bad wine that made a `ripple' in our culture.|author=Jeff Elder|date=6 December 2004|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-7705863.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In different episodes, Fred said he would mix Ripple with [[champagne]] to make "Champipple", Ripple with [[creme de menthe]] to create a drink he called "Cripple", and Ripple with [[Manischewitz]] [[kosher wine]] to what he called "Manischipple" When served [[sangria]] for the first time, Fred remarked that it tasted like "Ripple that's gone flat. They should call it Flapple."

* An ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' sketch from the late 1970s featured [[John Candy]]'s character Johnny LaRue being served Thunderbird in a French restaurant when he is unable to afford the more expensive French wines on the menu.

*[[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] infamously referenced Thunderbird during his [[King of The Ring]] promo on [[Jake 'The Snake' Roberts]]

===Music===
Flavored fortified wine inspired the [[Guns N' Roses]] song "[[Nightrain]]". [[ZZ Top]] (on ''[[Fandango!]]''), [[Seasick Steve]], (on ''[[I Started Out with Nothin and I Still Got Most of It Left]]''), and [[They Might Be Giants]] (on ''[[The Spine (album)|The Spine]]'') have all recorded songs titled "Thunderbird". The latter drink has been popular since the 1950s, at which time a popular rhythm and blues lyric went: "What's the word? Thunderbird / How's it sold? Good and cold / What's the jive? Bird's alive / What's the price? Thirty twice."

Additional songs in this vein include:

*"When the Word Was Thunderbird" (1976) by [[Billy Joe Shaver]]
*The Detroit garage rock band [[The Gories]] had a song entitled "Thunderbird ESQ".
*[[Townes Van Zandt]] sings a [[talking blues]] song reflecting on his experiences with Thunderbird entitled "Talking Thunderbird Blues".
*[[Ian Dury]]'s 1977 single "[[Sweet Gene Vincent]]" includes the lines "Shall I mourn your decline / With some Thunderbird wine / And a black handkerchief?"
*[[Arab Strap (band)|Arab Strap]]'s [[Aidan Moffat]] refers to "[...] drinking someone else's strawberry tonic wine..." in the band's 1996 debut single "[[The First Big Weekend]]".
*The last track on [[Elliott Smith]]'s first (1994) album is entitled "Kiwi Maddog 20/20 (Version 2 of 2)".  Night Train is mentioned in the lyrics to "See You Later".
*[[Mickey Newbury]]'s song "Why You Been Gone So Long" contains the lyrics: "Ain't nothin' I wanna do Lord I guess I could get stoned / Let the past paint pictures in my head / Kill a fifth of Thunderbird and try to write a sad song / Tell me baby now why you been gone so long". The song has been widely covered, with [[David Allan Coe]] altering the lyrics to "Kill a fifth of Thunderbird and smoke my way back home"
*"Lightning Bar Blues" is the ninth track on [[Hoyt Axton]]'s 1971 album ''Joy to the World''. The song centers around drinking "Ripple Wine" as in the chorus "I don't need no diamond ring, I don't need no Cadillac car, Just want to drink my Ripple Wine down in the Lightnin' Bar." "Lightning Bar Blues" was covered by several artists, most notably [[Arlo Guthrie]] on the album ''[[Hobo's Lullaby (album)|Hobo's Lullaby]]''.
*"Notorious Thugs", the 13th track on [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]'s 1997 album ''[[Life After Death]]'', features [[Krayzie Bone]] from [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]] rapping "to the dome with a shot of 'bird; never get tossed to the curb".
*St. Louis musician Smino released a song titled, "Wild Irish Roses" on his album ''[[Blkswn]]'', in 2017.

==Varieties==
In total, there are about 28,320 Jinuo people living in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asiaharvest.org/people-group-profiles/#china|title=People Group Profiles - Asia Harvest|website=asiaharvest.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70%-80% of Jinuo people can speak Jino fluently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/en/endangeredlanguages/atlas|title=Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger|last=Moseley|first=Christopher|date=2012|website=UNESCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jino languages has two subdialects of Youle Jino and Buyuan Jinuo,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NetCommons|date=2013-03-01|title=神戸市外国語大学学術情報リポジトリ|url=http://id.nii.ac.jp/1085/00001317/|journal=Annals of foreign studies|language=ja|volume=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are not [[mutually intelligible]].

Buyuan Jinuo is spoken by 21,000 people&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/jiy|title=Jinuo, Buyuan|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the speakers are monolingual, which means they only speak Jino language.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://endangeredlanguages.com/lang/4330|title=Did you know Buyuan Jinuo is endangered?|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no official written form.

==Classification==
The exact classification of Jino within the [[Loloish]] branch of [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language family remains uncertain. Jino is classified as a [[Southern Loloish]] (Hanoish) language by Ziwo Lama (2012),&lt;ref&gt;Lama, Ziwo Qiu-Fuyuan. 2012. ''[https://uta-ir.tdl.org/uta-ir/bitstream/handle/10106/11161/Lama_uta_2502D_11591.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Subgrouping of Nisoic (Yi) Languages]''. Ph.D. thesis, University of Texas at Arlington.&lt;/ref&gt; but as a [[Central Loloish]] language by Bradley (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, David. 2007. East and Southeast Asia. In Moseley, Christopher (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of the World's Endangered Languages'', 349-424. London &amp; New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Jino is also classified as a Southern Loloish language in Satterthwaite-Phillips' (2011) computational phylogenetic analysis of the Lolo-Burmese languages.&lt;ref&gt;Satterthwaite-Phillips, Damian. 2011. ''Phylogenetic inference of the Tibeto-Burman languages or On the usefulness of lexicostatistics (and "Megalo"-comparison) for the subgrouping of Tibeto-Burman''. Ph.D. dissertation, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The language usage is rapidly eliminating, in the 1980s there was 70%-80% of Jinuo people used Jino language. In 2000, There was less than 50% of the population can speak Jino language.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Xln94QUnnkC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=jinuo+language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wlKDEZ1UzX&amp;sig=OhL6-4wflTbWOUBuN5NvkLqJ45w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCkNXVwsjSAhXMKCYKHdfrDNUQ6AEIOTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=jinuo%20language&amp;f=false|title=The Language Situation in China|last=Yuming|first=Li|last2=Wei|first2=Li|date=2013-03-22|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=1614512531|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jino was recognized by the state council on 6 June 1979 as the last recognized minority nationality in China.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Historically, Jino people was organized as a matriarchal culture, and “Jino” means “descending from the uncle,” and it refers to the importance of mother’s brother in matriarchal societies.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZCOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=jino+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKnK_kyMjSAhXCOCYKHe3mB5kQ6AEIIzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=jino%20language&amp;f=false|title=Ethnic Groups of North, East, and Central Asia: An Encyclopedia|last=Minahan|first=James B.|date=2014-02-10|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610690188|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From language aspect, Jino language is similar to other languages under the branch of the Tibeto-Burman languages, because Jino people moved from the northwest of Yunnan province to the territories they are at now, but the timing and routes of this migration remain uncertain,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Geographic distribution==

Jinuo Township (Jinuo Mountain), located in [[Jinghong]] City of the [[Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture|Sipsongpanna Dai autonomous prefecture]] of [[Yunnan]] province, China.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Tonemes==
There are five tonemes in Buyuan Jino language. Gai believes that the function of tonemes are distinguishing lexical meanings and grammatical meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Xingzhi, Gai. 1986. Jinoyu Jianzhi [A brief description of the Jinuo language]. Beijing: Minzu Chubanshe.&lt;/ref&gt;

# [55] value tone (high level tone): it tends to exhibit vowels that are phonetically shortened
# [44] value tone (mid level tone): lower than 55, though high
# [31] value tone(low falling tone): low
# [35] value tone (rising tone): rising
# [53] value tone (high falling tone): falling from the top level

[53] value tone is considered difficult to tell when listen to native speaker &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Writing system==
Since there is no official written form for Jino, therefore, Jino does not have a writing system, but it developed several systems of signs to cover communication in different situations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jsNTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=jino+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKnK_kyMjSAhXCOCYKHe3mB5kQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=jino%20language&amp;f=false|title=China's Last but one matriarchy: The Jino of Yunnan|last=Arcones|first=Pedro Ceinos|date=2014-04-14|publisher=Pedro Ceinos|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used engraved wooden or bamboo boards to record debts between villages.

'''Koraga''' (also rendered ''Koragar, Koragara, Korangi)'' is a [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]] spoken by the [[Koraga people]], a [[Scheduled tribe]] people of [[Dakshina Kannada]], [[Karnataka]], and [[Kerala]] in South West [[India]]. The dialect spoken by the Koraga tribe in Kerala, Mudu Koraga, is divergent enough to not be intelligible with Korra Koraga.{{sfnp|Bhat|1971|p=2}}

==Classification==
Koraga is a member of the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] family of languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is further classified into the Southern Dravidian family.
Koraga is a spoken language and generally not written, whenever it is written it makes use of Kannada script. Koraga people are generally conversant in [[Tulu language|Tulu]]{{sfnp|Bhat|1971|p=4}} and [[Kannada]] languages and hence use those languages as a medium for producing literature.

==Dialects==
According to {{harvtxt|Bhat|1971}}, there are 4 dialects:{{sfnp|Bhat|1971|p=2}}
*''Onti'' (spoken in [[Udupi]])
*''Tappu'' (in [[Hebri]])
*''Mudu'' (in [[Kundapura]])
*''Ande'' (midway between ''tappu'' and ''onti'' and in [[Mangalore]])

All the speakers who speak ''Mudu'' dialect are bilingual with Kannada language and all speaking ''onti'' dialect are bilingual with Tulu language.{{sfnp|Bhat|1971|p=2}} This has resulted a strong influence of Kannada on Mudu koraga and also similar influence of Tulu is seen on onti koraga dialect.{{sfnp|Bhat|1971|pp=2 ,4}} Majority of negative forms of onti koraga language are borrowed from Tulu language.{{sfnp|Bhat|1971|p=45}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7024">[[Costa Rica]]'s official and predominant language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The variety spoken there, [[Costa Rican Spanish]], is a form of [[Central American Spanish]].

Costa Rica is a linguistically diverse country and home to at least five living local indigenous languages spoken by the descendants of pre-Columbian peoples: [[Maléku language|Maléku]], [[Cabécar]], [[Bribri language|Bribri]], [[Guaymí language|Guaymí]], and [[Buglere language|Buglere]].

Immigration has also brought people and languages from various countries around the world. Along the Atlantic Ocean in [[Limón Province]], inhabited primarily by Afro-Caribs, an [[English-based creole language]] called [[Mekatelyu]] or Patua is spoken to varying degrees, as is English; many older Limonenses speak English as their native language. The Quakers community, who settled in [[Monteverde]] in the early 1950s, speaks an older dialect of [[English language|English]], using ''[[thou]]'' instead of ''[[you]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mfschool.org/community/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707054309/http://www.mfschool.org/community/history.htm |archivedate=2013-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldspirituality.org/quaker-language.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Costa Rican Sign Language]] is also spoken by the deaf community, and Costa Rican Spanish slang is known as "pachuco".

Traditionally, Costa Rica has had no policies in favor of multiculturalism. The greatest advance in this respect came with the amendment of Article 76 of the Constitution of Costa Rica, which now states: ''"Spanish is the official language of the Nation. However, the State will oversee the maintenance and cultivation of indigenous national languages."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Costa Rica 1949 (rev. 2011)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Costa_Rica_2011?lang=en#231|website=Constitute|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Living indigenous languages==
Currently, in Costa Rica, there are six indigenous languages that are still used by their respective populations. All of them belonging to the [[Chibchan languages|Chibcha language family]]. Those languages are:

* [[Maléku language]]: Also known as Guatuso, spoken by around 800 people in north-eastern [[Alajuela Province]]. This language, along with Rama, belongs to the Votic branch of the [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan language family]].
* [[Cabécar|Cabécar language:]] Spoken in the [[Cordillera de Talamanca|Talamanca mountain range]] and in the southern Pacific region, Cabécar is the sister language to Bribri in the Isthmic branch of the [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan language family]].
* [[Bribri language]]: Bribri is spoken on the Atlantic slope of the country, including [[Limón Province]], the Talamanca mountain range, and the south Pacífic region. Together with Cabécar, it forms the Viceitic subgroup of Chibchan languages.
* [[Guna language]] : Guna is the language of native tribes in the area of the [[Cartago Province]] located in the center of Costa Rica. It is also part of the Isthmic branch of the [[Chibchan languages]], as well as [[Cabécar]].
* [[Guaymí language]]: Spoken in various indigenous territories to the southeast of [[Puntarenas Province]], bordering [[Panama]]. Together with Buglere, it belongs to the Guaymic subgroup of the [[Chibchan languages]]. Also known as Ngäbere or Movere.
* [[Buglere language]]: Spoken in the same territories as Guaymí, the language to which it is most closely related. It is also known as Bocotá.

== Extinct and formerly spoken languages ==
[[File:Map of indigenous languages in Costa Rica.png|thumb|350px|An indigenous language map of Costa Rica, pre-Spanish arrival.]]
Prior to the 9th century, only languages of the Chibchan family were spoken in Costa Rica. The extinct [[Huetar language]], probably affiliated with the Chibchan family, served as the ''lingua franca'' for the interior of Costa Rica and was considered by the Spanish upon their arrival to be the "general language" of all Costa Rica.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Historically, the range of the still-living [[Rama language]] also extended south into northern Costa Rica, where the Maléku language was also spoken. Boruca, an Isthmic Chibchan language, was formerly spoken across the southern Pacific slope while [[Bribri language|Bribri]] and [[Cabécar language|Cabécar]] speakers inhabited the northern Atlantic slope.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/filyling/article/view/6424/6129|title = La diversidad linguística de Costa Rica: las lenguas indígenas.|last = Constenla Umaña|first = Adolfo|date = 2011|journal = Revista de Filología y Lingüística de la Universidad de Costa Rica (37(2)). pp. 93-106.|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; An unknown language, known only as the ''lengua de Paro'', was also spoken on the western coast of the [[Gulf of Nicoya]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/chibcha/article/view/9635/9080|title = MAPA DE LA DISTRIBUCIÓN TERRITORIAL APROXIMADA DE LAS LENGUAS INDÍGENAS HABLADAS EN COSTA RICA Y EN SECTORES COLINDANTES DE NICARAGUA Y DE PANAMÁ EN EL SIGLO XVI|last = Adolfo Constenla Umaña, Eugenia Ibarra Rojas|first = |date = 2009|journal = Lingüística Chibcha |volume=28 |pages=109–111|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 9th century, speakers of the now-extinct [[Oto-Manguean language]] [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]] controlled most of northeast Costa Rica. Other Mesoamerican peoples penetrated Costa Rican territory. The [[Nahuan languages|Nahua]] speakers known as Nicarao, named after their [[Nicarao (cacique)|cacique of the same name]], lived in enclaves in [[Guanacaste Province]] as well as near the delta of the [[Sixaola River]],&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; speaking a dialect closer to nuclear [[Nahuatl]] in Mexico than to the [[Pipil language|Pipil]] of El Salvador and Nicaragua.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

At the beginning of the 21st century, two Costa Rican indigenous languages became extinct. Térraba, a variety of the [[Teribe language|Téribe language]], was spoken in the indigenous reserve of Térraba in the southeast of Puntarenas province. Until its recent extinction, Boruca was spoken in the Boruca and Curré reserves in the southeast of [[Puntarenas province]].

According to the national constitution:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Macedonia_2011?lang=en Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia] See amendment V&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
#The Macedonian language, written using its Cyrillic alphabet, is the official language throughout the Republic of Macedonia and in the international relations of the Republic of Macedonia.
#Any other language spoken by at least 20 percent of the population is also an official language, written using its alphabet, as specified below.
#Any official personal documents of citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian shall also be issued in that language, in addition to the Macedonian language, in accordance with the law.
#Any person living in a unit of local self-government in which at least 20 percent of the population speaks an official language other than Macedonian may use that official language to communicate with the office of the central government with responsibility for that municipality; such an office shall reply in that language in addition to Macedonian. Any person may use any official language to communicate with a main office of the central government, which shall reply in that language in addition to Macedonian.
#In the organs of the Republic of Macedonia, any official language other than Macedonian may be used in accordance with the law.
#In the units of local self-government where at least 20 percent of the population speaks a particular language, that language and its alphabet shall be used as an official language in addition to the Macedonian language and the Cyrillic alphabet. With respect to languages spoken by less than 20 percent of the population of a unit of local self-government, the local authorities shall decide on their use in public bodies. }}

Some minority languages are co-official, along with Macedonian, in the municipalities (''opštini'') where they are spoken by at least 20% of the municipal population. Therefore, Albanian is co-official in [[Tetovo municipality|Tetovo]], [[Brvenica municipality|Brvenica]], [[Vrapčište municipality|Vrapčište]] and other municipalities. Turkish is co-official in [[Centar Župa Municipality|Centar Župa]] and [[Plasnica municipality|Plasnica]]. Romani in [[Šuto Orizari municipality|Šuto Orizari]] and Aromanian in [[Kruševo municipality|Kruševo]], even though it is spoken by ~10% of the municipal population. [[Serbian language|Serbian]] is also co-official in [[Čučer-Sandevo municipality|Čučer-Sandevo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/pdf/kniga_13.pdf |title=Census |date=2002 |website=www.stat.gov.mk |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnian is the only recognized minority language that is not official on municipal level.

==List of languages==
===Macedonian===

Macedonian ({{lang|mk|македонски јазик}}, ''makedonski jazik'') is a [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic language]], spoken as a [[first language]] by approximately 1.4-2.5 million people principally in Macedonia and the [[Macedonian diaspora]]. It is the [[official language]] in Macedonia and a recognized [[minority language]] in parts of [[Albania]], [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]].

[[Standard Macedonian]] was implemented as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] in 1945&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mia.com.mk/default.aspx?mId=25&amp;vId=74488315&amp;lId=1&amp;pmId=25 |title=МИА - Македонска Информативна Агенцијa - НА ДЕНЕШЕН ДЕН |publisher=Mia.com.mk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308121705/http://www.mia.com.mk/default.aspx?mId=25&amp;vId=74488315&amp;lId=1&amp;pmId=25 |archivedate=2012-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since developed a thriving [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]]. Most of the [[Codification (linguistics)|codification]] was formalized during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=60aFAS1crFEC&amp;pg=PA213 ''Studies in contact linguistics''], G. Gilbert, Glenn G. Gilbert, Janet M. Fuller, Linda L. Thornburg, Peter Lang, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-8204-7934-7}},p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman, V. 1998 pp. 31-57"&gt;Friedman, V.

===Albanian===

Albanian ({{lang|sq|gjuha shqipe}}) is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] spoken by over 7.3 million people world-wide, primarily in [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]] but also in other areas of the [[Balkans]] in which there is an Albanian population, including western Macedonia, southern [[Montenegro]], southern [[Serbia]] and  [[Greece]]. Albanian is also spoken in centuries-old Albanian-based dialect speaking communities scattered in southern Greece, southern [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/1617/italy/albanians.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121173237/http://www.minorityrights.org/1617/italy/albanians.html |archivedate=2012-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sicily]], [[Ukraine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albanianlanguage.net/|title=The Albanian Language - Robert Elsie|website=www.albanianlanguage.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Albanian diaspora. Within Macedonia, Albanian is spoken in the North-Western and South-Western parts of the Republic.

=== Turkish ===

Turkish (''Türkçe'') is the most populous of the [[Turkic languages]], with over 70 million native speakers.&lt;ref name=Syracuse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newlll.syr.edu/index.php?pgm=Turkish&amp;page=home|title=Turkish Language Program|publisher=Syracuse University|access-date=2012-12-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823044535/http://newlll.syr.edu/index.php?pgm=Turkish&amp;page=home|archive-date=2011-08-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers are located predominantly in [[Turkey]], with smaller groups in Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia, [[Northern Cyprus]], Greece, and other parts of Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia. Small Turkish-speaking communities can be found in several places in Macedonia, such as [[Vrapčište]], [[Skopje]] and [[Gostivar]].

=== Romani ===

Balkan Romani ({{lang-rom|romani ćhib}}) is one of several related languages of the [[Romani people]], belonging to the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] branch of the Indo-European language family. Many varieties of Romani are divergent and sometimes considered languages of their own. The largest of these are [[Vlax Romani]] (about 900,000 speakers), [[Balkan Romani]] (700,000), [[Carpathian Romani]] (500,000) and [[Sinti Romani]] (300,000). In Macedonia Balkan Romani is spoken. [[Šuto Orizari]] is the largest Romani-speaking settlement in the country.

===Serbian language===

Serbian (српски, ''srpski'') is a standardized [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of the [[Serbo-Croatian language]]&lt;ref name="David Dalby 2000, pg. 445, 53"&gt;David Dalby, ''Linguasphere'' (1999/2000, Linguasphere Observatory), pg. 445, 53-AAA-g, "Srpski+Hrvatski, Serbo-Croatian".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin W. Fortson IV, ''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction'', 2nd ed. (2010, Blackwell), pg. 431, "Because of their mutual intelligibility, Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian are usually thought of as constituting one language called Serbo-Croatian."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil.muni.cz"&gt;Václav Blažek, "On the Internal Classification of Indo-European Languages: Survey" [http://www.phil.muni.cz/linguistica/art/blazek/bla-003.pdf retrieved 20 Oct 2010], pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; spoken by [[Serbs]],&lt;ref&gt;E.C. Hawkesworth, "Serbian-Croatian-Bosnian Linguistic Complex", also B Arsenijević, "Serbia and Montenegro: Language Situation". Both in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics]]'', 2nd edition, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; mainly in [[Serbia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Croatia]] and Macedonia.{{cn|date=May 2018}} It is official in Serbia and one of the official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is the principal language of the Serbs. Serbian is mainly spoken in the municipalities of [[Municipality of Čučer Sandevo|Čučer Sandevo]] (~20% of the population) and [[Municipality of Staro Nagoričane|Staro Nagoričane]] (19%).

=== Bosnian ===

Bosnian (''bosanski'', босански) is another standardized register of Serbo-Croatian,&lt;ref name="David Dalby 2000, pg. 445, 53"/&gt;&lt;ref name="phil.muni.cz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin V. Fortson, IV, ''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction'', 2nd ed. (2010, Blackwell), pg. 431, "Because of their mutual intelligibility, Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian are usually thought of as constituting one language called Serbo-Croatian."&lt;/ref&gt; spoken by [[Bosniaks]]. As a standardized form of the [[Shtokavian dialect]], it is one of the three official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/legal/oth-legist/doc/fbih-constitution.doc Art. 6 of the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina], available at the official website of Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Bosnian-speaking Macedonian citizens live in [[Skopje]] and the [[Municipality of Veles]].

=== Aromanian ===

Aromanian  (''Limba Armãneascã'') or ''Vlach'' is an [[Eastern Romance language]] spoken in several pockets across Southeastern Europe. Its speakers are called [[Aromanians]] or "Vlachs" (which is an [[exonym]] in widespread use to define the communities in the Balkans). It shares many features with modern [[Romanian language|Romanian]], having similar morphology and syntax, as well as a large common vocabulary inherited from Latin. An important source of dissimilarity between Romanian and Aromanian is the [[Adstratum|adstratum]] languages: while Romanian has been influenced to a greater extent by the [[Slavic languages]], Aromanian has been more influenced by the [[Greek language]], with which it has been in close contact throughout its history. The largest Aromanian-speaking community in Macedonia can be found in the town of [[Kruševo]] (~10% of the municipal population). In Macedonia, the language is known as 'Vlach' (влашки јазик, ''vlaški jazik'').

===Sign language===

The [[Macedonian sign language]] ({{lang-mk|македонски знаковен јазик|translit=makedonski znakoven jazik}} or {{lang|mk|македонски гестовен јазик}} / {{lang|mk|makedonski gestoven jazik}}) is a [[sign language]] of the [[deaf community]] in Macedonia.&lt;ref name="јазик"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deafmkd.org.mk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=79&amp;lang=mk|title=Знаковен јазик|first=|last=Admin|website=www.deafmkd.org.mk}}&lt;/ref&gt; As all sign languages, the Macedonian sign language is also based on gestures and body movements, particularly movements with the hands. The precise number of signers in Macedonia is not known, but 6,000 people request signed news on Macedonian television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://star.dnevnik.com.mk/default.aspx?pbroj=1782&amp;stID=10852 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727190206/http://star.dnevnik.com.mk/default.aspx?pbroj=1782&amp;stID=10852 |archive-date=2011-07-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The learning and the usage of the language, as well as the rights of the deaf community in Macedonia are regulated by a national law.&lt;ref name="закон"&gt;''[http://www.deafmkd.org.mk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=82&amp;lang=mk Закон за употреба на  знаковниот јазик, Службен весник на Република Македонија, број 105, 21 август 2009, Скопје]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign languages===
Many people speak a foreign language. Most of the older population has knowledge of [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[French language|French]] or [[German language|German]]. [[Russian language|Russian]] is also well-known. Among the younger population, [[English language|English]] is extremely common, along with knowledge of Serbo-Croatian and some German.

The '''Orang Laut language''' or '''''Loncong''''', is one of the [[Malayan languages]].  It is one of several native languages of [[Orang Laut]] ("Sea People") of the [[Bangka Island|Bangka]] and [[Belitung]] islands in [[Indonesia]], and may be two distinct languages.

Anderbeck (2012) considers there to be an Orang Laut genetic grouping of languages, which includes the Kedah, Riau, and Sekak subgroups. The Malayic language Duano is divergent, and does not form part of this group.

'''Northern Thai''' ({{lang-th|ภาษาถิ่นพายัพ, ภาษาไทยถิ่นเหนือ}}; {{RTGS|Phasa Thin Phayap}}), '''Lanna''' ({{lang-th|ล้านนา}}), or '''Kam Mueang''' (Northern Thai: {{Script|Lana|ᨣᩴᩤᨾᩮᩥᩬᨦ}} {{IPA-nod|kam˧.mɯːəŋ˧|}}, {{IPA audio link|nod-kammueang.ogg}}, [[Thai language|Thai]]: คำเมือง {{IPA-th|kʰam˧ mɯːəŋ˧|}}) is the language of the [[Northern Thai people]] of Lanna, [[Thailand]]. It is a [[Thai languages]] that is phonotactically closely related to [[Lao language|Lao]]. Northern Thai has approximately six million speakers, most of whom live in the native [[Northern Thailand]], with a smaller community of approximately several thousand speakers in northwestern [[Laos]].

Speakers of this language generally consider the name "Tai Yuan" to be pejorative. They refer to themselves and the language as ''khon mueang'' (คนเมือง, {{IPA-th|xon˧ mɯːəŋ˧|}}), Lanna, or Northern Thai. The language is also sometimes referred to as ''phayap'' (พายัพ, {{IPA-th|pʰāːjáp}}), "Northwestern (speech)".

The term Yuan is still sometimes used for Northern Thai's distinctive [[Tai Tham alphabet]], which is closely related to the old Tai Lue alphabet and the Lao religious alphabets. The use of the ''tua mueang'', as the traditional alphabet is known, is now largely limited to Buddhist temples, where many old sermon manuscripts are still in active use. There is no active production of literature in the traditional alphabet. The modern spoken form is called Kam Muang. There is a resurgence of interest in writing it in the traditional way, but the modern pronunciation differs from that prescribed in spelling rules.&lt;ref name=Natnapang&gt;Natnapang 2004, Section 3.5.6 ''The changing pronunciation of the Lanna script and Kammuang'' As with all languages, the pronunciation of the written and spoken forms changes over time. This is another problem that Kam Muang speakers may have when they learn to write the Lanna script. These changes occur in only some words, and there are no readily apparent rules to explain the changes.... &lt;/ref&gt;

From a purely genealogical standpoint, most linguists consider Northern Thai to be more closely related to [[Central Thai]] than to Lao or [[Isan language|Isan]], but the language has been heavily influenced by both Lao and Central Thai throughout history.  All [[Southwestern Tai languages]] form a coherent [[dialect continuum]] of more or less mutually intelligible varieties, with few sharp dividing lines. Nevertheless, Northern Thai has today become closer to the Central Thai language. A recent research finds that the speakers of Northern Thai language (or Kham Mueang) have become so few – as most people in northern Thailand now invariably speak standard Thai – such that they now use mostly central Thai words, seasoning their speech only with "kham mueang" accent. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|first1=Pim|last1=Kemasingki|first2= Pariyakorn|last2= Prateepkoh|title= Kham Mueang: the slow death of a language|journal= Chiang Mai City Life|date= August 1, 2017|page=8|quote=there are still many people speaking kham mueang, but as an accent, not as a language.

== Varieties and related languages ==
The Northern Thai language has various names in Northern Thai, Thai, and other [[Tai languages]]. 
* In Northern Thai, it is commonly called ''kam mueang'' ({{Script|Lana|ᨣᩴᩤᨾᩮᩥᩬᨦ}}, กำเมือง {{IPA|/kām.mɯ̄aŋ/}}, literally "city language"; cf. [[Thai language|Standard Thai]]: คำเมือง {{IPA|/kʰām.mɯ̄aŋ/}}), or ''phasa Lan Na'' ({{Script|Lana|ᨽᩣᩇᩣᩃ᩶ᩣ᩠ᨶᨶᩣ}}, ภาษาล้านนา {{IPA|/pʰāː.sǎː.láːn.nāː/}}, literally "the language of [[Lan Na]]"). 
* In [[Thai language|Central Thai]] and [[Southern Thai language|Southern Thai]], Northern Thai is known as ''phasa thin phayap'' (ภาษาถิ่นพายัพ {{IPA|/pʰāː.sǎː.tʰìn.pʰāː.jáp/}}, literally "the language of the northern region"), or ''phasa thai thin nuea'' (ภาษาไทยถิ่นเหนือ {{IPA|/pʰāː.sǎː.tʰāj.tʰìn.nɯ̌a/}}, literally "the Thai language of the northern region", or colloquially it is known as ''phasa nuea'' (ภาษาเหนือ {{IPA|/pʰāː.sǎː.nɯ̌a/}}, literally "the northern language"). 
* In [[Lao language|Lao]], it is known as ''phasa nyuan'' or ''phasa nyon'' ({{lang|lo|ພາສາຍວນ}} or {{lang|lo|ພາສາໂຍນ}} respectively, {{IPA|/pʰáː.sǎː.ɲúan/}} or {{IPA|/pʰáː.sǎː.ɲóːn/}} respectively, literally "the Tai Yuan language"). 
* In [[Tai Lü language|Tai Lü]], it is known as ''kam yon'' ({{Script|Talu|ᦅᧄᦍᦷᧃ}} {{IPA|kâm.jôn}}, literally "the Tai Yuan language"). 
* In [[Shan language|Shan]] it is known as ''kwam yon'' ({{Script|Mymr|ၵႂၢမ်းယူၼ်း}} {{IPA|kwáːm.jón}}, literally "the Tai Yuan language").

Thanajirawat (2018)&lt;ref&gt;Thanajirawat, Zirivarnphicha (2018). ''Tonal Geography of Tai Yuan in Southeast Asia''. Paper presented at the 28th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society, held May 17-19, 2018 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.&lt;/ref&gt; classifies Tai Yuan into five major dialect groups based on tonal split and merger patterns.

== Script ==
[[Image:Lanna lng.png|thumb|Northern Thai in its own alphabet, the [[Tai Tham alphabet]]]]
Currently, different scripts are used to write Northern Thai. Northern Thai is traditionally written with the [[Tai Tham alphabet|Tai Tham script]], which in Northern Thai is called ''tua mueang'' ({{Script|Lana|ᨲᩫ᩠ᩅᨾᩮᩥ᩠ᩋᨦ}} ตั๋วเมือง {{IPA|/tǔa.mɯ̄aŋ/}}) or ''tua tham'' ({{Script|Lana|ᨲᩫ᩠ᩅᨵᩢᨾ᩠ᨾ᩺}} ตั๋วธัมม์ {{IPA|/tǔa.tʰām/}}). However, native speakers are presently illiterate in the traditional script; therefore, they instead use the [[Thai alphabet|Thai script]] to write the language. In [[Laos]], the [[Lao alphabet|Lao script]] is commonly used to write Northern Thai.

[[File:Sign in Tai Tham and Thai King Kawila.JPG|200px|thumbnail|left|A sign written in Northern Thai, Thai, and English]]
Some problems arise when the Thai script is used to write Northern Thai. In particular, Standard Thai script cannot transcribe all Northern Thai tones. The two falling tones in Northern Thai correspond to a single falling tone in Thai. Specifically, Northern Thai has two types of falling tones: high-falling tone ({{IPA|˥˧}}) and falling tone ({{IPA|˥˩}}). However, Thai lacks the distinction between the two falling tones, not having a high-falling tone ({{IPA|˥˧}}). When using Thai script to write Northern Thai tones, the distinction of the two falling tones is lost because Thai script can only indicate a low falling tone ({{IPA|˥˩}}). As an example, the tonal distinction between {{IPA|/ka᷇ː/}} (ก้า ({{Script|Lana|ᨠᩖ᩶ᩣ}} กล้า) "to be brave") and {{IPA|/kâː/}} (ก้า ({{Script|Lana|ᨣ᩵ᩤ}} ค่า) "value") is lost when written in Thai since as only {{IPA|/kâː/}} (ก้า) is permitted. Consequently, the meaning of ก้า is ambiguous as it can mean both "to be brave" and "value". Similarly, {{IPA|/pa᷇ːj/}} (ป้าย ({{Script|Lana|ᨸ᩶ᩣᩭ}} ป้าย) "sign") and {{IPA|/pâːj/}}  (ป้าย ({{Script|Lana|ᨻ᩵ᩣᩭ}} พ่าย) "to lose") have the same problem and only {{IPA|/pâːj/}} (ป้าย) is permitted. As a result, the spelling ป้าย is ambiguous because it can mean both "sign" or "to lose". Such tonal mergence ambiguity is avoided when the language is written with the Northern Thai script.

:&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; Implied before any vowel without an initial and after a short vowel without a final.
:&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt; /kʰ/ and /t͡ɕʰ/ occur in loanwords from [[Thai language|Standard Thai]].

====Initial consonant clusters====
There are two relatively common consonant clusters:

*/kw/
*/xw/

There are also several other, less frequent clusters recorded,&lt;ref&gt;Rungruengsi 2004, pp. ณ-ด&lt;/ref&gt; though apparently in the process of being lost:&lt;ref name=Natnapang_2&gt;Natnapang 2004, Section 3.5.2  ''Initial consonant clusters in the Lanna script''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Final consonants ====
All [[plosive consonant|plosive sounds]] are [[Unreleased stop|unreleased]]. Hence, final {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} sounds are pronounced as {{IPA|[p̚]}}, {{IPA|[t̚]}}, and {{IPA|[k̚]}} respectively.

:&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; The glottal stop appears at the end when no final follows a short vowel.

===Vowels===
The basic vowels of the Northern Thai language are similar to those of [[Thai language|Standard Thai]]. They, from front to back and close to open, are given in the following table. The top entry in every cell is the symbol from the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]], the second entry gives the spelling in the [[Thai alphabet]], where a dash (–) indicates the position of the initial consonant after which the vowel is pronounced. A second dash indicates that a final consonant must follow.

==Grammar==
The grammar of Northern Thai is similar to those of other [[Tai languages]]. The [[word order]] is [[subject–verb–object]], although the subject is often [[Pro-drop language|omitted]]. Just as [[Thai language|Standard Thai]], Northern Thai pronouns are selected according to the gender and relative status of speaker and audience.

===Adjectives and adverbs===
There is no morphological distinction between [[adverbs]] and [[adjectives]]. Many words can be used in either function. They succeed the word which they modify, which may be a noun, verb, or another adjective or adverb. 
*แม่ญิงเฒ่า (''mae nying thao'', {{IPA|/mɛ̂ː.ɲīŋ.tʰa᷇w/}}) ''an old woman''
*แม่ญิงตี้เฒ่าโวย (''mae nying ti thao woi'', {{IPA|/mɛ̂ː.ɲīŋ.tîː.tʰa᷇w.wōːj/}}) ''a woman who became old quickly''

Because adjectives can be used as complete predicates, many words used to indicate tense in verbs (see Verbs:Aspect below) may be used to describe adjectives.
*ข้าหิว (''kha hiw'', {{IPA|[xa᷇ː hǐw]}}) ''I am hungry.''
*ข้าจะหิว (''kha cha hiw'', {{IPA|[xa᷇ː t͡ɕa hǐw]}}) ''I will be hungry.''
*ข้ากะลังหิว (''kha kalang hiw'', {{IPA|[xa᷇ː ka.lāŋ hǐw]}}) ''I am hungry right now.''
*ข้าหิวแล้ว (''kha hiu laew'', {{IPA|[xa᷇ː hǐw lɛ́ːw]}}) ''I am already hungry.''

===Verbs===
[[Verb]]s do not [[inflected language|inflect]]. They do not change with person, tense, voice, mood, or number; nor are there any [[participles]].
* ข้าตี๋เปิ้น (''kha ti poen'', {{IPA|[xa᷇ː tǐː pɤ̂n]}}), ''I hit him''.
* เปิ้นตี๋ข้า (''poen ti kha'', {{IPA|[pɤ̂n tǐː xa᷇ː]}}), ''He hit me''.
The [[passive voice]] is indicated by the insertion of โดน (''don'', {{IPA|[dōːn]}}) before the verb. For example:
* เปิ้นโดนตี๋ (''poen don ti'', {{IPA|[pɤ̂n dōːn tǐː]}}), ''He is hit'' or ''He got hit''. This describes an action that is out of the receiver's control and, thus, conveys suffering.

To convey the opposite sense, a sense of having an opportunity arrive, ได้ (''dai'', {{IPA|[da᷇j]}}, can) is used. For example:
* เปิ้นจะได้ไปแอ่วเมืองลาว (''poen cha dai pai aew mueang lao'', {{IPA|[pɤ̂n t͡ɕa da᷇j pāj ʔɛ̀w mɯ̄aŋ lāːw]}}), ''He gets to visit Laos.''
* เปิ้นตี๋ได้ (''poen ti dai'', {{IPA|[pɤ̂n tǐː da᷇j]}}), ''He is/was allowed to hit'' or ''He is/was able to hit''

[[Negation (rhetoric)|Negation]] is indicated by placing บ่ (''bor'',{{IPA|[bɔ̀]}}  or {{IPA|[bà]}} not) before the verb.
* เปิ้นบ่ตี๋, (''poen bor ti'', {{IPA|[pɤ̂n bɔ̀ tǐː]}}) ''He is not hitting.'' or ''He not hit.''

[[Grammatical aspect|Aspect]] is conveyed by [[Grammatical aspect|aspect marker]]s before or after the verb.
:[[Grammatical aspect|Present]] can be indicated by กะลัง (''kalang'', {{IPA|[ka.lāŋ]}}, currently) or กะลังหะ (''kalangha'', {{IPA|[ka.lāŋ.hà]}}, currently) before the verb for ongoing action (like English -ing form), by อยู่ (''yu'', {{IPA|[jùː]}}) after the verb, or by both. For example:
:* เปิ้นกะลังหะล่น (''poen kalangha lon'',  {{IPA|[pɤ̂n ka.lāŋ.hà lôn]}}), or
:* เปิ้นล่นอยู่ (''poen lon yu'', {{IPA|[pɤ̂n lôn jùː]}}), or
:* เปิ้นกะลังหะล่นอยู่ (''poen kalanɡha lon yu'', {{IPA|[pɤ̂n ka.lāŋ.hà lôn jùː]}}), ''He is running.''

:[[Grammatical aspect|Future]] can be indicated by จะ (''cha'', {{IPA|[t͡ɕaʔ]}}, will) before the verb or by a time expression indicating the future. For example:
:* เปิ้นจะล่น (''poen cha lon'', {{IPA|[pɤ̂n t͡ɕaʔ lôn]}}), ''He will run'' or ''He is going to run.''

:[[Grammatical aspect|Past]] can be indicated by ได้ (''dai'', {{IPA|[da᷇j]}}) before the verb or by a time expression indicating the past. However, แล้ว (''laew'',  :{{IPA|[lɛ́ːw]}}, already) is often used to indicate the past aspect by being placed behind the verb. Or, both ได้ and แล้ว are put together to form the past aspect expression. For example:
:* เปิ้นได้กิ๋น (''poen dai kin'', {{IPA|[pɤ̂n da᷇j kǐn]}}), ''He ate.''
:* เปิ้นกิ๋นแล้ว (''poen kin laew'', {{IPA|[pɤ̂n kǐn lɛ́ːw]}}, ''He has eaten.''
:* เปิ้นได้กิ๋นแล้ว (''poen dai kin laew'', {{IPA|[pɤ̂n da᷇j kǐn lɛ́ːw]}}), ''He's already eaten.''
Aspect markers are not required.
:* ข้ากิ๋นตี้หั้น (''kha kin tihan'', {{IPA|[xa᷇ kǐn tîː.ha᷇n]}}), ''I eat there.''
:* ข้ากิ๋นตี้หั้นตะวา (''kha kin tihan tawa'', {{IPA|[xa᷇ kǐn tîː.ha᷇n ta.wāː]}}), ''I ate there yesterday.''
:* ข้ากิ๋นตี้หั้นวันพูก (''kha kin tihan wanphuk'', {{IPA|[xa᷇ kǐn tîː.ha᷇n wān.pʰûːk]}}), ''I'll eat there tomorrow.''

Words that indicate obligation include ''at cha'' (อาจจะ), ''na cha'' (น่าจะ), ''khuan cha'' (ควรจะ){{Dubious|Challenged Word Khuan cha|reason=Looks Siamese|date=January 2016}}, and ''tong'' (ต้อง).
*''at cha'' (อาจจะ, {{IPA|/ʔàːt.t͡ɕa/}}) ''Might''
:* เปิ้นอาจจะมา (''poen at cha ma'', {{IPA|/pɤ̂n ʔàːt.t͡ɕa māː/}}) ''He might come.''
*''na cha'' (น่าจะ, {{IPA|/na᷇ː.t͡ɕa/}}) ''Likely to''
:* เปิ้นน่าจะมา (''poen na cha ma'', {{IPA|/pɤ̂n na᷇ː.t͡ɕa māː/}}) ''He is likely to come.''
*''khuan cha'' (ควรจะ, {{IPA|/xūan.t͡ɕa/}}) ''Should''
:* เปิ้นควรจะมา (''poen khuan cha ma'', {{IPA|/pɤ̂n xūan.t͡ɕa māː/}}) ''He should come.''
*''tong'' (ต้อง, {{IPA|/tɔ᷇ːŋ/}}) ''Must''
:* เปิ้นต้องมา (''poen tong ma'', {{IPA|/pɤ̂n tɔ᷇ːŋ māː/}}) ''He must come.''

Actions that wherein one is busily engaged can be indicated by มัวก่า (''mua ka'', {{IPA|/mūa.kàː/}}).
:* ก่อมัวก่ากิ๋นหั้นเนาะ (''kor mua ka kin han nor'', {{IPA|/kɔ̀ mūa kàː kǐn ha᷇n nɔ᷇ʔ/}}) ''(It's that you/he/she) just keeps on eating it like that, you know?''

Words that express one's desire to do something can by indicated by ''khai'' (ใค่) and ''kan'' (กั๊น).
*''khai'' (ใค่, {{IPA|/xâj/}}, ''to want, to desire'')
:* ข้าเจ้าใค่กิ๋น (''kha.chao khai kin'', {{IPA|/xa᷇ː.t͡ɕa᷇w xâj kǐn/}}) ''I want to eat.''
*''kan'' (กั๊น, {{IPA|/kán/}}, ''to try'')
:* ข้าเจ้ากั๊นกิ๋น (''kha.chao kan kin'', {{IPA|/xa᷇ː.t͡ɕa᷇w kán kǐn/}}) ''I try to eat.''

''Phor tha wa'' (ผ่อท่าว่า, {{IPA|/pʰɔ̀ː.tʰâː.wâː/}}) is used to give the impression or sensation of being something or having a particular quality. 
:* ผ่อท่าว่าเปิ้นปิ๊กมาแล้ว (''phor tha wa poen pik ma laew'', {{IPA|/pʰɔ̀ː tʰâː wâː pɤ̂n pi᷇k māː lɛ́ːw/}}) ''It seems that he has returned.''

=== Final particles ===
Northern Thai has a number of final particles, which have different functions.

==== Interrogative particles ====
Some of the most common interrogative particles are ''kor'' (ก่อ, {{IPA|/kɔ̀ː/}}) and ''ka'' (กา, {{IPA|/kāː/}})
*''kor'' (ก่อ, {{IPA|/kɔ̀ː/}}, denoting yes/no question)
:* ม่วนก่อ (''muan kor'', {{IPA|/mûan kɔ̀ː/}}) ''Is it fun?''
*''ka'' (กา (and its variants: ก๋า, กา), {{IPA|/kāː/}}, denoting confirmative question) 
:* ม่วนกา (''muan ka'', {{IPA|/mûan kāː/}}) ''It is fun, right?''

==== Imperative particles ====
Some imperative particles are แล่, จิ่ม, and เตอะ.
''lae'' (แล่, {{IPA|/lɛ̂ː/}})
:* กิ๋นแล่ (''kin lae'', {{IPA|/kǐn lɛ̂ː/}}) ''Eat! (Authoritative)''.
''chim'' (จิ่ม, {{IPA|/t͡ɕìm/}})
:* ขอกิ๋นจิ่ม (''khor kin chim'', {{IPA|/xɔ̌ː kǐn t͡ɕìm/}}) ''May I eat please?''
''hia'' (เหีย, {{IPA|/hǐa/}})
:* กิ๋นเหีย (''kin hia'', {{IPA|/kǐn hǐa/}}) ''Eat! (because I know it will be beneficial to you)''.
''toe'' (เต๊อะ, {{IPA|/tɤ᷇ʔ/}})
:* กิ๋นเต๊อะ (''kin toe'', {{IPA|/kǐn tɤ᷇ʔ/}}) ''Eat, please.''

==== Polite particles ====
Polite particles include คับ and เจ้า.
*''khap'' (คับ, {{IPA|/xa᷇p/}}, used by males)
:* กิ๋นเข้าแล้วคับ (''kin khaw laew khap'', {{IPA|/kǐn xa᷇w lɛ́ːw xa᷇p/}}) ''I have eaten, sir/ma'am''.
*''chao'' (เจ้า, {{IPA|/t͡ɕa᷇w/}}, used by females)
:* กิ๋นเข้าแล้วเจ้า (''kin khaw laew chao'', {{IPA|/kǐn xa᷇w lɛ́ːw t͡ɕa᷇w/}}) ''I have eaten, sir/ma'am''.

===Nouns===
[[Noun]]s are [[Uninflected word|uninflected]] and have no [[Grammatical gender|gender]]; there are no [[article (grammar)|article]]s.

Nouns are neither [[grammatical number|singular]] nor [[plural]]. Some specific nouns are [[reduplication|reduplicated]] to form [[collective number|collective]]s: ละอ่อน (''la-orn'', {{IPA|[la.ʔɔ̀ːn]}}, child) is often repeated as ละอ่อนๆ (''la-orn la-orn'', {{IPA|[la.ʔɔ̀ːn la.ʔɔ̀ːn]}},) to refer to a group of children.

The word หมู่(''mu'', {{IPA|[mùː]}}) may be used as a prefix of a noun or pronoun as a collective to pluralize or emphasise the following word. (หมู่ผม, ''mu phom'', {{IPA|[mùː pʰǒm]}}, ''we'' (exclusive), masculine; หมู่เฮา ''mu hao'', {{IPA|[mùː hāw]}}, emphasised ''we''; หมู่หมา ''mu ma'', {{IPA|[mùː mǎː]}}, ''(the) dogs'').

Plurals are expressed by adding [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]]s, used as [[measure word]]s (ลักษณนาม), in the form of noun-number-classifier (คูห้าคน, "teacher five person" for "five teachers").

===Pronouns===
Pronouns may be omitted once they have already been established in the first sentence, unless the pronoun in the following sentences is different from the first sentence. The pronoun "you" may also be omitted if the speaker is speaking directly to a second person. Moreover, names may replace pronouns, and they can even replace the first person singular pronoun.

==Vocabulary==
Northern Thai shares much vocabulary with Standard Thai, especially scientific terms, which draw many prefixes and suffixes from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], and it also has its own distinctive words. Just like Thai and Lao, Northern Thai has borrowed many loanwords from [[Khmer language|Khmer]], Sanskrit, and Pali.

Unlike Northern Thai, Standard Thai lacks [[palatal nasal]] sound (/ɲ/). Thus, the palatal nasal sound (/ɲ/) and the palatal approximant sound (/j/) in Northern Thai both correspond to the palatal approximant sound in Standard Thai:

Unlike Northern Thai, Standard Thai lacks a high-falling tone ([˥˧]). The high falling tone ([˥˧]) and falling tone ([˥˩]) in Northern Thai both correspond to the falling tone in Standard Thai ([˥˩]).

===Similar words===
There is not a straightforward correspondence between the tones of Northern and Standard Thai.  It also depends on the initial consonant, as can be seen from the merged [[Proto-Tai language#Tones|Gedney tone boxes]] for Standard Thai and the accent of Chiang Mai:

Note that the commonalities between columns are features of the Chiang Mai accent.  On the other hand, the relationships between rows are typical of Northern Thai, being found for at least for Chiang Mai, [[Chiang Rai]],&lt;ref name=Li77/&gt; [[Phayao]],&lt;ref name=Li77/&gt;
&lt;!--
 | doi = 10.1007/b62130
 | mr = 1748380
 | zbl = 0945.14001 --&gt;
[[Nan Province|Nan]] and [[Prae]],&lt;ref name=Li77/&gt; and extending at least to [[Tak Province|Tak]]&lt;ref name=Li77/&gt; and the old 6-tone accent of [[Khün language|Tai Khuen]],&lt;ref name=Li77/&gt; except that the checked syllables of Chiang Rai are more complicated.

The primary function of a tone box is etymological.  However, it also serves as a summary of the rules for tone indication when the writing system is essentially etymological in that regard, as is the case with the major Tai-language writing systems using the Thai, Lanna, New Tai Lue, Lao and Tai Dam scripts.

Some words differ only as a result of the regular tone correspondences:

==== Aspiration of initial consonants ====
Some [[aspirated consonant]]s in the low-class consonant group (อักษรต่ำ /ʔàk.sɔ̌ːn.tàm/) in Standard Thai correspond to [[Unaspirated consonant|unaspirated sounds]] in Northern Thai.  These sounds include ค, ช, ท, and พ (/kʰ/, /t͡ɕʰ/, /tʰ/, and /pʰ/ respectively), but sounds such as ฅ, คร, ฆ, ฒ, พร, ภ (/kʰ/, /kʰr/, /kʰ/, /tʰ/, /pʰr/, and /pʰ/ respectively) remain aspirated. Such aspirated consonants that are unaspirated in Northern Thai correspond to unaspirated voiced sounds in [[Proto-Tai language|Proto-Tai]] which are *ɡ, *ɟ, *d, and *b (ค, ช, ท, and พ respectively).:

'''Paraguayan Sign Language''', or ''Lengua de señas paraguaya'' (LSPY), is the [[deaf sign language]] of [[Paraguay]]. It is not intelligible with neighboring languages, nor with [[American Sign Language]], but speakers report that it has historical connections with [[Uruguayan Sign Language]]. It developed outside the schools, and was only used in education "recently" (as of 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2009-026.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paraguay is notably a bilingual country, where both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Guarani language|Guarani]] are spoken. The Language Law No. 4251 provides for [[fingerspelling]] adequate to both languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalguarani.com/582_tadeo_zarratea/15932_la_ley_de_lenguas_del_paraguay_comentada_concordada_traducida_al_guarani_y_sus_antecedentes_obra_de_tadeo_zarratea.html Ley de Lenguas Nº 4251] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Geoffrey Leech]], there is a [[politeness]] principle with [[gricean maxims|conversational maxims]] similar to those formulated by [[Paul Grice]]. He lists six maxims: tact, generosity, approbation, modesty, agreement, and sympathy. The first and second form a pair, as do the third and the fourth. These maxims vary from [[culture]] to culture: what may be considered polite in one culture may be strange or downright rude in another.

==The tact maxim==
The tact maxim states: 'Minimize the expression of beliefs which imply cost to other; maximize the expression of beliefs which imply benefit to other.' The first part of this maxim fits in with Brown and [[Stephen C. Levinson|Levinson]]'s negative [[politeness]] strategy of minimising the imposition, and the second part reflects the positive politeness strategy of attending to the hearer's interests, wants, and needs. For example:
* ''Could I interrupt you for a second?''
* ''If I could just clarify this then.''

==The generosity maxim==
Leech's generosity maxim states: 'Minimize the expression of beliefs that express or imply benefit to self; maximize the expression of beliefs that express or imply cost to self.' Unlike the tact maxim, the maxim of generosity focuses on the speaker, and says that others should be put first instead of the self. For example:
* ''You relax and let me do the dishes.''
* ''You must come and have dinner with us.''

==The approbation maxim==
The approbation maxim states: 'Minimize the expression of beliefs which express dispraise of other; maximize the expression of beliefs which express approval of other.' It is preferred to praise others and if this is impossible, to sidestep the issue, to give some sort of minimal response (possibly through the use of [[euphemism]]s), or to remain silent. The first part of the maxim avoids disagreement; the second part intends to make other people feel good by showing solidarity. For example:
* ''I heard you singing at the karaoke last night. It sounded like you were enjoying yourself!''
* ''Gideon, I know you're a genius – would you know how to solve this math problem here?''

==The modesty maxim==
Maxim of modesty is one of the six maxims proposed by Leech (1983) in his PP (politeness principle) meaning to minimize praise or to maximize dispraise of self. The modesty maxim states: "Minimize the expression of praise of self; maximize the expression of dispraise of self." For example:
* ''Oh, I'm so stupid – I didn't make a note of our lecture! Did you?''

==The agreement maxim==
The agreement maxim runs as follows: 'Minimize the expression of disagreement between self and other; maximize the expression of agreement between self and other.' It is in line with Brown and [[Stephen C. Levinson|Levinson]]'s positive [[politeness]] strategies of 'seek agreement' and 'avoid disagreement,' to which they attach great importance. However, it is not being claimed that people totally avoid disagreement. It is simply observed that they are much more direct in expressing agreement, rather than disagreement. For example:
* ''A: I don't want my daughter to do this, I want her to do that.''
* ''B: Yes, but ma'am, I thought we resolved this already on your last visit.''

==The sympathy maxim==
The sympathy maxim states: 'minimize antipathy between self and other; maximize sympathy between the self and other.' This includes a small group of speech acts such as congratulation, commiseration, and expressing condolences – all of which is in accordance with Brown and Levinson's positive [[politeness]] strategy of attending to the hearer's interests, wants, and needs. For example:
* ''I am sorry to hear about your father.''

[[File:Raymond Schwartz.jpg|thumb|240px|Raymond Schwartz]]
'''Raymond Schwartz'''  (April 8, 1894 – May 14, 1973), was a French banker and [[Esperanto]] author who wrote many poems and novels in Esperanto, as well as skits which he directed for [[Paris]]ian [[Esperanto]] [[cabaret]]s.

==Biography==
Born in [[Metz]], a city in [[Alsace-Lorraine]] (German: ''Elsass-Lothringen'') that from [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|1871]] to [[Treaty of Versailles (1919)|1918]] was part of [[German Empire|Germany]], his family was French-speaking. He received a good education in Metz and spoke not only [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] often but also [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]].

Very early he became an [[Esperantist]] and dreamt of a better future through the diffusion of Esperanto. [[World War I]], when he was conscripted into the German army and had to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], was a disaster for him as a [[pacifism|pacifist]] and for the [[Esperanto movement]] in general. After the war he did not remain at [[Metz]], now again a French city, but moved to Paris, where he worked in a large banking firm until his retirement.

==Esperanto writings==
Between the wars he published in different periodicals, particularly in ''[[Literatura Mondo]]'', and wrote two volumes of poetry. His poetic works ''Verdkata testamento'' ("The will of the green cat") (1926) and ''Stranga butiko'' ("The strange boutique")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-leipzig.de/esperanto/texte/bibl/butiko/ Stranga Butiko] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830000243/http://www.uni-leipzig.de/esperanto/texte/bibl/butiko/ |date=August 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1931) are imaginative and humorous fantasies involving word games, characteristics also found in ''Prozo ridetanta'' (1928) ("Smiling prose").

His short novel ''Anni kaj Montmartre'' ("Annie and Montmartre", 1930) recounts the adventures of a young naîve German woman in Paris; it departs from the conventions of original Esperanto literature, in particular because of its style of writing.

From 1933 to 1935 he published the monthly satirical magazine ''[[La Pirato]]'' ("The Pirate"), which made him a sort of ''enfant terrible'' of the [[Esperanto movement]], one for whom there were no secrets and for whom everything was an occasion for humour.

His masterwork, published after [[World War II]], is ''[[Kiel akvo de l' rivero]]'' ("Like the water of the river"), considered as his most significant and most moving book. This is a partly autobiographical novel of a young Frenchman from the Franco-German frontier who comes to Berlin after graduation but must flee at the outbreak of war in 1914. During the [[occupation of France by Nazi Germany]] he joins the [[French Resistance]]. After the war he once more meets in Paris the woman he loved as a young man in Berlin. This classic novel about a family torn apart by two world wars is both serious and amusing.

He collaborated on ''[[Sennacieca Revuo]],'' an annual cultural review published by [[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda]] (World Non-National Association), writing a column titled "Laŭ mia ridpunkto." The name was a [[portmanteau word]] formed from ''vidpunkto,'' (Esperanto for "viewpoint") and ''ridi'' (a word meaning "to laugh"). The column itself was written in a humorous style that included ''kalemburoj'' ([[pun]]s) and ''antistrofoj'' ([[spoonerism]]s).

==Cabaret==
Serious and competent in his profession, he showed an altogether different face in the Esperanto cabarets, where he created many skits, creating for Esperantists the character of a merry drunkard. Since 1881 there had been in [[Paris]] a famous cabaret known as [[Le Chat Noir]] ("The Black Cat"). At [[Montmartre]], on the outskirts of Paris, he founded in December 1920 an Esperanto cabaret called ''La Verda Kato'' ("The Green Cat"),&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Luez, [http://miresperanto.narod.ru/konsultoj/schwartz.htm "Memore pri Raymond Schwartz"], in ''Fonto'', No. 119, May 1993 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023033621/http://miresperanto.narod.ru/konsultoj/schwartz.htm |date=October 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which he directed from 1920 to 1926, as well as ''La Bolanta Kaldrono'' ("The Boiling Cauldron"), which ran from 1936 to 1939. In 1949 he was joint founder of ''[[Tri Koboldoj]]'' ("Three Imps"), which continued in existence until 1956. His skits and books were amusing, spiritual and sometime risqué. "If people cannot laugh at themselves, they have not grown up" was a favourite saying of his.

'''Registered mail''' is a [[mail]] service offered by postal services in many countries, which allows the sender proof of mailing via a mailing receipt and, upon request, electronic verification that an article was delivered or that a delivery attempt was made. Depending on the country, additional services may also be available, such as:
* a [[chain of custody]], where the posted item has its details recorded in a register to enable its location to be tracked, sometimes with added insurance to cover loss;
*return receipt, called an [[Avis de réception]], which provides a postcard or electronic notification with the date of delivery and recipient signature;
*restricted delivery, which confirms that only a specified person, or authorized agent, will receive the specific mail.
The name of this service varies from country to country, and postal services in some countries offer more than one level of service under different names (e.g., "certified mail" and "registered mail" in the U.S.). See the country-specific information below for details.

==Background==
Traditionally, registered mail was a manual process which gave rise to a great variety of distinctive [[postal markings]], like handstamps, and usage of registration labels.{{sfnp|Mackay|1982|pp=154–179, 296–366}} Many countries have issued special [[postal stationery]] and [[postage stamps]] for registered mail. Earlier similar services were known as ''[[Money Letter]]s''. Today, however, the registration process is largely computerized with [[barcode]] registration labels replacing the traditional analog labels having only a printed [[serial number]].

Generally, the item is pre-paid with the normal postage rate and an additional charge known as a ''registration fee''. Upon payment of this fee the sender is given a receipt, and (usually) a unique numbered ''registration label'' is affixed to the letter. As the letter travels from post office to post office and through any [[sorting office]], it has to be signed for on a ledger. This process is completed when the letter is delivered and the receiver signs for the item. With computerization and barcode technology, much of the logging once done manually has become simpler and leads to greater options for the sender and receiver alike to access the status of their shipment via the internet. Many postal authorities provide tracing information for registered items on their website.

Internationally, the use of registered mail requires labels with a 13-digit reference number and corresponding barcode. The first two letters indicate registration (usually "RR") while the last 2 letters usually represent the country where the registered item was posted. ''E.g.'', RR913282511SG indicating Singapore, RB5584847749CN indicating China or RR123456785KR indicating Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upu.int/document/2005/an/cep_gn_ep_3-1/src/d006_ad00_an05_p00_r00.doc |format=doc |title=S10c-5 Identification of postal items - Part C: 13 character identifier for special letter products |website=[[Universal Postal Union]] |accessdate=15 December 2009 |date=3 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Western Australia Registered Letter.JPG|thumb|A Western Australia registered letter from 1892 complete with original green linen tape.]]
The earliest reference to a mail registration system dates to July 1556, during the reign of [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], of [[England]].  In that example, ''the poste between this and the Northe should eche of them keepe a booke and entrye of every letter that he shall receive, the tyme of the deliverie thereof unto his hands with the parties names  that shall bring it unto him, whose handes he shall also take to his booke, witnessing the same note to be trewe.''{{sfnp|Joyce|1893|p=234}} This was likely for state security rather than mail security.{{sfnp|Mackay|1982|p=7}} In 1603, another Order of Council was made whereby all letters had to be recorded.{{sfnp|Joyce|1893|p=234}} This system was, in effect, a registration system, although it applied to all items sent via the post.

[[William Dockwra]]'s 1680s [[London Penny Post]] also recorded all details on letters accepted for onward transmission,{{sfnp|Joyce|1893|p=234}} but unlike the [[General Post Office]], gave compensation for losses.

The registration of letters as known today was introduced in 1841 in Great Britain. The letter had to be enclosed within a large sheet of green paper. The green sheet was addressed to the Post Office where the recipient lived. The green sheet was then used as a receipt and was returned to the office of origin after delivery. On 1 July 1858 the green sheet was replaced by a green silk ribbon and shortly afterwards by a green linen tape. In 1870 the tape was replaced by green string. On the introduction of [[postal stationery]] registration envelopes in 1878 the string was replaced by printed blue crossed lines. The blue crossed lines have survived on registered letters to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Huggins |first=Alan Keith |authorlink=Alan K.

==By country==
===Canada===

Canada Post's ''Registered Mail'' service provides the sender with a mailing receipt, and upon delivery of the item, with the delivery date and a copy of the signature of the addressee or the addressee's representative. Registered Mail may include lettermail, documents, valuables, and literature for the blind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.canadapost.ca/tools/pg/manual/pgregister-e.asp |title=Registered Mail™ (Domestic) |website=[[Canada Post]] |accessdate=9 May 2015 |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===

Israel Post's ''Registed Mail'' service ({{lang-he-n|דֹּאַר רָשׁוּם}}, ''doar rashum'') provides the sender with a mailing receipt, and upon delivery of the item, the addresee must sign in order to obtain the item. The sender can monitor the item until its delivery, for items intended for 84 cities in Israel. A confirmation of delivery is sent to the sender for an additional fee. Registered Mail may include letters, postcards and printed matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelpost.co.il/postshirut.nsf/misparide/216?OpenDocument |title=Sending registered mail in Israel |website=[[Israel Postal Company|Israel Post]]|accessdate=6 July 2016 |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November 2015 a preliminary reading of an amendment to Postal Law that forces the sender to mention his name on an item sent via registered mail, was passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://main.knesset.gov.il/News/PressReleases/Pages/press251115-l0.aspx |title=Announcements |website=[[Knesset]] |date=25 November 2015 |accessdate=6 July 2016 |language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the press, the major opposition to this bill is the Courts Administration that sends most of its mail via registered mail with a confirmation of delivery, and claims that knowing the identity of the sender, many of their addressees will choose not to accept the items, thus delaying the legal proceedings they are a party to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yediot.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4824696,00.html |title=Who is against the law that will require the sender to identify himself by registered mail? |first=Amichai |last=Atali |newspaper=[[Yedioth Ahronoth]] |date=5 July 2016 |accessdate=6 July 2016 |language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
[[PostNord]]'s service ''Registered Mail'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Rekommenderad försändelse''), often shortened as ''Rek'', will only be delivered after the recipient have verified their identity with some form of [[Identity documents in Sweden|ID]] and their [[Personal identity number (Sweden)|personal identity number]] been logged. The letter can also be collected by a representative provided this agent carries both their own ID and the recipient's ID. All ''Registered Mail'' is trackable in over 30 countries via PostNord's website and mobile app. Any domestic ''Registered Mail'' is insured for up to 10 000 [[Swedish krona|SEK]] of the market value. International ''Registered Mail'' is insured for up to either 2 000 SEK or 10 000 SEK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Registered Mail International |url=http://www.postnord.se/en/sending/international/with-confirmation/registered-mail-international |website=PostNord |accessdate=24 August 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824211523/http://www.postnord.se/en/sending/international/with-confirmation/registered-mail-international |archivedate=24 August 2017 |quote=Each Registered Mail item is given a unique item ID and can be tracked all the way from posting to delivery in more than 30 countries (e.g. Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland and Germany).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an optional added service called ''Personal Delivery'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Personlig utlämning'') where only the recipient can collect the letter and denies all else, including representatives and [[power of attorney]]. Another optional added service is [[Avis de réception|Advice of Delivery]] ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Mottagningsbevis'') where a form signed by the receiver is sent back to the sender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Registered Mail Domestic |url=http://www.postnord.se/en/sending/domestic/with-confirmation/registered-mail-domestic |website=PostNord |accessdate=23 August 2017 |language=English |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824053442/http://www.postnord.se/en/sending/domestic/with-confirmation/registered-mail-domestic |archivedate=24 August 2017|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Registered Mail'' will be delivered to one of PostNord's service points, often a supermarket, where the identity of the receiver, and any representative, can be verified and logged before handing over the letter.

Since autumn 2017 Postnord no longer require signature for delivering registered mail from China Post. Registered mail from China Post is only traceable in the sense that the mailman marks the item as delivered when and if it is delivered to the recipients mailbox. No proof that the recipient has received the mail is collected. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.postnord.com/sv/om-oss/vara-asikter/blogg/blogg/kina-nytt-favoritland-att-handla-ifran/|title=Kina nytt favoritland att handla ifrån|author=|date=|website=Startsida - PostNord|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Since 1998, the ''Special Delivery'' service has been the only registered service offered by [[Royal Mail]], after the old-style ''Registered Letter'' service was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gbps.org.uk/displays/royal-mail-special-delivery/ |title=Royal Mail Special Delivery from 1971 |first=Austin |last=Davis |website=Great Britain Philatelic Society |accessdate=7 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6KBgi5u5r |archivedate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

[[File:Stamp US 1955 15c certified mail.jpg|thumb|United States 15c certified mail stamp of 1955, postman, [[Scott catalog]] FA1. No further stamps were issued in this category.]]

The [[United States Postal Service]] offers two distinct services called ''Certified Mail'' and
''Registered Mail''.

====Certified Mail====

Certified Mail allows the sender proof of mailing via a mailing receipt and, upon request electronic verification that an article was delivered or that a delivery attempt was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Receipt for Certified Mail |url=https://store.usps.com/store/browse/productDetailSingleSku.jsp?productId=P_FORM_3800&amp;categoryId=priority-mail |website=USPS |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some in-transit tracking and delivery confirmation information may be provided, but there is no formal [[chain of custody]]. Certified Mail is only available for [[United States Postal Service#Priority Mail|Priority Mail]] and [[United States Postal Service#First-class mail|First Class Mail]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pe.usps.gov/text/DMM300/503.htm#3_2_2 |title=Eligibility for Certified Mail |website=USPS}}&lt;/ref&gt; letters mailed within the [[United States]] and its [[Territories of the United States|territories]] (including [[Military mail|APOs and FPOs]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pe.usps.gov/text/DMM300/503.htm#3_3_2 |title=Available USPS Destinations for Certified Mail |website=USPS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each piece of Certified Mail is assigned a unique label number which serves as an official record of mailing of the item by the Postal Service.

U.S. certified mail began in 1955 after the idea was originated by Assistant U.S. Postmaster General Joseph Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The United States Postal Service: An American History 1775–2006 |url=http://about.usps.com/publications/pub100/welcome.htm |website=United States Postal Service |date=November 2012 |accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also acceptable to send [[Classified information in the United States|U.S. Government classified information]] at the [[Classified information in the United States#Confidential|Confidential]] level using the Certified Mail service.  Certified mail may be selected for many reasons, not just for important business mailings. It is used by anyone who needs or wishes to provide a tracking number to the receiver as proof of mailing. It also allows the receiver to track their package/envelope through the online system at usps.com using the unique tracking number provided by the mailer.&lt;ref name="uspsfaq"&gt;USPS FAQs&lt;/ref&gt;

Certified Mail can be done either with or without "return receipt requested", often called "RRR", which costs an additional fee. The return receipt is a green postcard-sized paper that is mailed back to the sender by the post office upon receipt by the addressee as proof of delivery. Today the USPS new Return Receipt Electronic (RRE) provides electronic proof of delivery information.  When the letter reaches its final delivery destination the letter carrier captures the signature of the person that accepts the letter and the information is electronically stored. As indicated on the return receipt card, either the addressee or the addressee's "agent" may sign for the document.&lt;ref name="uspsfaq"/&gt;

====Registered Mail====
Registered mail service is offered by the [[United States Postal Service]] as an extra service for First Class or Priority Mail shipments.  Registered Mail provides end-to-end security in locked containers.  Registered Mail [[chain of custody|custody records]] are maintained, but are not normally provided to the customer, unless a claim is filed.&lt;ref name="uspsfaq"/&gt;

In the United States, registered mail may be used to send classified material up to the [[Classified information in the United States#Secret|Secret]] classified level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2007/julqtr/pdf/31cfr2.28.pdf |format=pdf |title=Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations, §2.28 |date=1 July 2007 |website=[[Government Publishing Office]] |accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{External links|date=June 2015}}
[[File:Gwoyu.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Languages can be romanized in a number of ways, as shown here with [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]]]]

'''Romanization''' or '''romanisation''', in [[linguistics]], is the conversion of writing from a different [[writing system]] to the [[Latin script|Roman (Latin) script]], or a system for doing so. Methods of romanization include [[transliteration]], for representing written text, and [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], for representing the spoken word, and combinations of both. Transcription methods can be subdivided into ''[[phonemic orthography|phonemic]] transcription'', which records the [[phonemes]] or units of [[semantic]] meaning in speech, and more strict ''[[phonetic transcription|phonetic]] transcription'', which records speech sounds with precision.

==Methods==
There are many consistent or [[standardized]] romanization systems. They can be classified by their characteristics. A particular system’s characteristics may make it better-suited for various, sometimes contradictory applications, including document retrieval, linguistic analysis, easy readability, faithful representation of pronunciation.
* Source, or donor language – A system may be tailored to romanize text from a particular language, or a series of languages, or for any language in a particular writing system. A language-specific system typically preserves language features like pronunciation, while the general one may be better for cataloguing international texts.
* Target, or receiver language – Most systems are intended for an audience that speaks or reads a particular language. (So-called ''international'' romanization systems for Cyrillic text are based on central-European alphabets like the [[Czech alphabet|Czech]] and [[Croatian alphabet]].)
* Simplicity – Since the basic [[Latin alphabet]] has a smaller number of letters than many other writing systems, [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], [[diacritics]], or special characters must be used to represent them all in Latin script. This affects the ease of creation, digital storage and transmission, reproduction, and reading of the romanized text.
* Reversibility – Whether or not the original can be restored from the converted text. Some reversible systems allow for an irreversible simplified version.

===Transliteration===
{{Main|Transliteration}}
If the romanization attempts to transliterate the original script, the guiding principle is a one-to-one mapping of characters in the source language into the target script, with less emphasis on how the result sounds when pronounced according to the reader's language. For example, the [[Nihon-shiki]] romanization of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] allows the informed reader to reconstruct the original Japanese [[kana]] syllables with 100% accuracy, but requires additional knowledge for correct pronunciation.

===Transcription===
{{Main|Transcription (linguistics)}}

====Phonemic====
{{See also|Phonemic orthography}}
Most romanizations are intended to enable the casual reader who is unfamiliar with the original script to pronounce the source language reasonably accurately. Such romanizations follow the principle of [[phonemic orthography|phonemic transcription]] and attempt to render the significant sounds ([[phoneme]]s) of the original as faithfully as possible in the target language. The popular [[Hepburn romanization]] of Japanese is an example of a transcriptive romanization designed for English speakers.

====Phonetic====
{{See also|Phonetic transcription}}
A [[phonetic]] conversion goes one step further and attempts to depict all [[Phone (phonetics)|phones]] in the source language, sacrificing legibility if necessary by using characters or conventions not found in the target script. In practice such a representation almost never tries to represent ''every'' possible allophone—especially those that occur naturally due to [[coarticulation]] effects—and instead limits itself to the most significant allophonic distinctions. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is the most common system of phonetic transcription.

===Tradeoffs===
For most language pairs, building a usable romanization involves tradeoffs between the two extremes. Pure transcriptions are generally not possible, as the source language usually contains sounds and distinctions not found in the target language, but which must be shown for the romanized form to be comprehensible. Furthermore, due to [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] and [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] variance no [[written language]] represents any [[spoken language]] with perfect accuracy and the vocal interpretation of a [[Writing system|script]] may vary by a great degree among languages. In modern times the chain of transcription is usually spoken foreign language, written foreign language, written native language, spoken (read) native language. Reducing the number of those processes, i.e. removing one or both steps of writing, usually leads to more accurate oral articulations. In general, outside a limited audience of scholars, romanizations tend to lean more towards transcription. As an example, consider the Japanese martial art 柔術: the Nihon-shiki romanization ''zyûzyutu'' may allow someone who knows Japanese to reconstruct the kana syllables {{nowrap|じゅうじゅつ}}, but most native English speakers or rather readers would find it easier to guess the pronunciation from the Hepburn version, ''[[jujutsu|jūjutsu]]''.

==Romanization of specific writing systems==

===Indic (Brahmic) scripts===
{{See also|Devanagari transliteration|Romanization of Bengali|Romanization of Malayalam}}

The [[Brahmic family]] of [[abugida]]s is used for languages of the Indian subcontinent and south-east Asia. There is a long tradition in the west to study [[Sanskrit]] and other Indic texts in Latin transliteration. Various transliteration conventions have been used for Indic scripts since the time of Sir William Jones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gabriel Pradīpaka |url=http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3part2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040315080622/http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3part2.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-03-15 |title=A comparison of some of them |publisher=Sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar |date= |accessdate=2013-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Devanagari–nastaʿlīq (Hindustani) ====
[[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] is an [[Indo-Aryan language]] with extreme [[digraphia]] and [[diglossia]] resulting from the [[Hindi–Urdu controversy]] starting in the 1800s. Technically, Hindustani itself is recognized by neither the language community nor any governments. Two [[Standard language|standardized]] [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]], [[Standard Hindi]] and [[Standard Urdu]], are recognized as [[official language]]s in India and Pakistan. However, in practice the situation is,
* In Pakistan:  Standard (Saaf or Khaalis) Urdu is the "high" variety, whereas Hindustani is the "low" variety used by the masses (called Urdu, written in [[nastaʿlīq script]]).
* In India, both Standard (Shuddh) Hindi and Standard (Saaf or Khaalis) Urdu are the "H" varieties (written in [[devanagari]] and nastaʿlīq respectively), whereas Hindustani is the "L" variety used by the masses and written in either devanagari or nastaʿlīq (and called 'Hindi' or 'Urdu' respectively).

The digraphia renders any work in either script largely inaccessible to users of the other script, though otherwise Hindustani is a perfectly mutually intelligible language, essentially meaning that any kind of text-based [[open source]] collaboration is impossible among devanagari and nastaʿlīq readers.

Initiated in 2011, the Hamari Boli Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamariboli.com |title=hamariboli.co |publisher=Hamariboli.com |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2013-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601231148/http://www.hamariboli.com/ |archivedate=2013-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a full-scale open-source [[language planning]] initiative aimed at Hindustani script, style, status &amp; lexical reform and modernization. One of primary stated objectives of Hamari Boli is to relieve Hindustani of the crippling devanagari–nastaʿlīq digraphia by way of romanization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-4-84689-Hamari-boli-angraizon-ke-rasmul-khat-mein ''The News International'' - Dec 29, 2011] -- "Hamari Boli (our language) is perhaps one of the very first serious undertakings to explore, develop and encourage the growth of Roman script in the use of Urdu/Hindi language"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese===
{{Main|Romanization of Chinese}}

Romanization of the [[Sinitic languages]], particularly [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], has proved a very difficult problem, although the issue is further complicated by political considerations. Because of this, many romanization tables contain Chinese characters plus one or more romanizations or [[Zhuyin]].

====Mandarin====
* [[ALA-LC romanization|ALA-LC]]: Used to be similar to Wade–Giles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/chinese.pdf |format=PDF |title=Chinese |publisher=Loc.gov |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; but converted to [[Hanyu Pinyin]] in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/catdir/pinyin/romcover.html |title=New Chinese Romanization Guidelines |publisher=Loc.gov |date=1998-11-03 |accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[EFEO]]. Developed by [[École française d'Extrême-Orient]] in the 19th century, used mainly in France.
* [[Latinxua Sin Wenz]] (1926): Omitted tone sounds. Used mainly in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Xinjiang]] in the 1930s. Predecessor of [[Hanyu Pinyin]].
* [[Lessing-Othmer]]: Used mainly in Germany.
* [[Postal romanization]] (1906): Early standard for international addresses
* [[Wade–Giles]] (1892): Transliteration. Very popular from the 19th century until recently and continues to be used by some Western academics.
* [[Yale romanization of Mandarin|Yale]] (1942): Created by the U.S. for battlefield communication and used in the influential Yale textbooks.
* [[Legge romanization]]: Created by [[James Legge]], a Scottish missionary.

=====Mainland China=====
* [[Hanyu Pinyin]] (1958): In [[mainland China]], Hanyu Pinyin has been used officially to romanize [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] for decades, primarily as a linguistic tool for teaching the standardized language. The system is also used in other Chinese-speaking areas such as [[Singapore]] and parts of [[Taiwan]], and has been adopted by much of the international community as a standard for writing Chinese words and names in the Latin script. The value of Hanyu Pinyin in education in China lies in the fact that China, like any other populated area with comparable area and population, has numerous distinct [[Chinese dialect|dialects]], though there is just one common written language and one common standardized spoken form. (These comments apply to Romanization in general)
* [[ISO 7098]] (1991): Based on Hanyu Pinyin.

===Japanese===
{{Main|Romanization of Japanese}}
Romanization (or, more generally, [[Roman letters]]) is called "[[rōmaji]]" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The most common systems are:
* [[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn]] (1867): transcription to Anglo-American practices, used in geographical names
* [[Nihon-shiki romanization|Nihon-shiki]] (1885): transliteration. Also adopted as ([[ISO 3602 Strict]]) in 1989.
* [[Kunrei-shiki romanization|Kunrei-shiki]] (1937): transliteration. Also adopted as ([[ISO 3602]]).
* [[JSL romanization|JSL]] (1987): transcription. Named after the book ''Japanese: The Spoken Language'' by Eleanor Jorden.
* [[ALA-LC romanization|ALA-LC]]: Similar to Modified Hepburn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/japanese.pdf |title=Japanese |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=2014-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wāpuro rōmaji|Wāpuro]]: ("word processor romanization") transliteration. Not strictly a system, but a collection of common practices that enables input of Japanese text.

===Korean===
{{Main|Romanization of Korean}}

While romanization has taken various and at times seemingly unstructured forms, some sets of rules do exist:
* [[McCune–Reischauer]] (MR; 1937?), the first transcription to gain some acceptance. A slightly changed version of MR was the official system for [[Korean language|Korean]] in [[South Korea]] from 1984 to 2000, and yet a different modification is still the official system in [[North Korea]]. Uses [[breve]]s, [[apostrophe]]s and [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diereses]], the latter two indicating orthographic syllable boundaries in cases that would otherwise be ambiguous.&lt;br&gt;What is called MR may in many cases be any of a number of systems that differ from each other and from the original MR mostly in whether word endings are separated from the stem by a space, a hyphen or&amp;nbsp;– according to McCune's and Reischauer's system&amp;nbsp;– not at all; and if a hyphen or space is used, whether sound change is reflected in a stem's last and an ending's first consonant letter (e.g. ''pur-i'' vs. ''pul-i''). Although mostly irrelevant when transcribing uninflected words, these aberrations are so widespread that any mention of "McCune-Reischauer romanization" may not necessarily refer to the original system as published in the 1930s.
** There is, for example, the [[ALA-LC romanization|ALA-LC]] / U.S. Library of Congress system, based on MR but with some deviations. Word division is addressed in detail, with a generous use of spaces to separate word endings from stems that is not seen in MR. Syllables of given names are always separated with a hyphen, which is expressly never done by MR. Sound changes are ignored more often than in MR. Distinguishes between '''‘''' and '''’'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/korean.pdf |format=PDF |title=Korean |publisher=Loc.gov |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several problems with MR led to the development of the newer systems:
* [[Yale romanization of Korean|Yale]] (1942): This system has become the established standard romanization for Korean among [[linguistics|linguists]]. Vowel length in old or dialectal pronunciation is indicated by a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]. In cases that would otherwise be ambiguous, orthographic syllable boundaries are indicated with a period. Indicates disappearance of consonants.
* [[Revised Romanization of Korean]] (RR; 2000): Includes rules both for transcription and for transliteration. South Korea now officially uses this system that was approved in 2000. Road signs and textbooks were required to follow these rules as soon as possible, at a cost estimated by the government to be at least US$20 million. All road signs, names of railway and subway stations on line maps and signs etc. have been changed. The change has been either ignored or [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]] in some cases, notably the romanization of names and existing companies. RR is generally similar to MR, but uses no diacritics or apostrophes, and uses distinct letters for ㅌ/ㄷ (t/d), ㅋ/ㄱ (k/g), ㅊ/ㅈ (ch/j) and ㅍ/ㅂ (p/b). In cases of ambiguity, orthographic syllable boundaries were intended to be indicated with a [[hyphen]], but this is inconsistently applied in practice.
* [[ISO/TR 11941]] (1996): This actually is two different standards under one name: one for North Korea (DPRK) and the other for South Korea (ROK). The initial submission to the ISO was based heavily on Yale and was a joint effort between both states, but they could not agree on the final draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sori.org/hangul/romanizations.html#Roman_Intro |title=A superficial comparison between the two |publisher=Sori.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fred Lukoff|Lukoff]] romanization, developed 1945–47 for his ''Spoken Korean'' coursebooks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glossika.com/en/dict/korpin.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214042244/http://www.glossika.com/en/dict/korpin.html |date=February 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippine languages===
{{main|Filipino orthography}}
Almost all [[Languages of the Philippines]] (including [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]], the [[Bicol languages]], [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] and other [[Visayan languages]], [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], and the [[Spanish-based creole languages|Spanish-based]] [[Creole language|creole]] [[Chavacano language|Chavacano]]) use the [[Filipino alphabet|Modern Filipino Alphabet]].

When Spain colonised the Philippines in the late 16th century, the numerous languages of the Philippines were written in various scripts, such as [[Baybayin]]. These were initially promoted by the colonists but later replaced by Spanish transcriptions, which are still evident in place names and surnames. Letters such as [[C]], [[Ll]], and [[Ñ]] were considered Hispanic additions and removed in the ''[[Abakada]]'', an attempt at a more indigenous alphabet devised by [[Lope K. Santos]] in 1940. These were eventually superseded by the Pilipino Alphabet and by the 28-letter, Modern Filipino Alphabet, which adds Ñ and the native [[Ng (digraph)|Ng]] to the standard, 26-letter [[Latin alphabet]].

While the Spanish language itself uses a very [[phonemic]] spelling, the romanised spelling created for Philippine languages is even more so. For example, the Spanish ''caballo'' ([kaˈβa.ʎo], "horse"), the same word in Tagalog is ''kabayo'' (demonstrating [[yeismo]] in the pronunciation of the Spanish "Ll" digraph).

===Thai===
{{main|Romanization of Thai}}
[[Thai language|Thai]], spoken in [[Thailand]] and some areas of Laos, Burma and China, is written with [[Thai alphabet|its own script]], probably descended from mixture of Tai–Laotian and [[Old Khmer]], in the [[Brahmic family]].

===Cyrillic===
In English language library catalogues, bibliographies, and most academic publications, the [[ALA-LC romanization for Russian|Library of Congress transliteration method]] is used worldwide.

In linguistics, [[scientific transliteration]] is used for both [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Glagolitic alphabet]]s. This applies to [[Old Church Slavonic]], as well as modern [[Slavic languages]] that use these alphabets.

====Bulgarian====
{{Main|Romanization of Bulgarian}}

A system based on [[scientific transliteration]] and [[ISO/R 9:1968]] was considered official in Bulgaria since the 1970s. Since the late 1990s, Bulgarian authorities have switched to the so-called [[Romanization of Bulgarian#Streamlined System|Streamlined System]] avoiding the use of diacritics and optimized for compatibility with English. This system became mandatory for public use with a law passed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;State Gazette # 19, Sofia, 13 March 2009. (in Bulgarian)&lt;/ref&gt; Where the old system uses &lt;č,š,ž,št,c,j,ă&gt;, the new system uses &lt;ch,sh,zh,sht,ts,y,a&gt;.

The new Bulgarian system was endorsed for official use also by UN in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eki.ee/wgrs/rom1_bg.htm|title=UN Romanization of Bulgarian for Geographical Names (1977)|work=Eki.ee|accessdate=2015-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[United States Board on Geographic Names|BGN]] and [[Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use|PCGN]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/Romanization/Romanization_Bulgarian.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219024011/http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/Romanization/Romanization_Bulgarian.pdf |date=December 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no single universally accepted system of writing [[Russian language|Russian]] using the Latin script—in fact there are a huge number of such systems: some are adjusted for a particular target language (e.g. German or French), some are designed as a librarian's transliteration, some are prescribed for Russian travellers' passports; the transcription of some names is purely traditional. &amp;nbsp; All this has resulted in great reduplication of names. &amp;nbsp; E.g. the name of the Russian composer [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] may also be written as ''Tchaykovsky'', ''Tchajkovskij'', ''Tchaikowski'', ''Tschaikowski'', ''Czajkowski'', ''Čajkovskij'', ''Čajkovski'', ''Chajkovskij'', ''Çaykovski'', ''Chaykovsky'', ''Chaykovskiy'', ''Chaikovski'', ''Tshaikovski'', ''Tšaikovski'', ''Tsjajkovskij'' etc. Systems include:

* [[Hungary]] (where the people and language are called ''Ruszin'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]])
* northern [[Maramureș]], [[Romania]], where the people are called ''Ruteni'' and the language ''Ruteană'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]

== Classification ==
{{also|Iazychie}}

The classification and identification of Rusyn is historically and politically problematic. Before [[World War I]], Rusyns were recognized as the Ukrainians of Galicia within the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], however in the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Hungarian]] part they were recognized as Rusyns/Ruthenes. Crown Prince [[Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] had planned to recognize a Rusyn-majority area as one of the states of a planned [[United States of Greater Austria]] before his assassination. After the war, Austria-Hungary was partitioned, and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] was appended to the new Czechoslovak state as its easternmost province. With the advent of [[World War II]], [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] declared its independence, lasting not even one day, until its occupation and annexation by Hungary. After the war, the region was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] as part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], which proceeded with an anti-ethnic assimilation program. Poland did the same, using internal exile to move all Ukrainians from the southern homelands to western areas [[Operation Vistula|conquered from Germany]], and switch everyday language to Polish.

[[File:Vojvodina rusyn croatian czech map.png|thumb|195px|left|Official usage of [[Pannonian Rusyn]] in [[Vojvodina]], Serbia.]]

Scholars with the former Institute of Slavic and Balkan Studies in Moscow (now the Institute of Slavonic Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences) formally re-acknowledged Rusyn as a separate language in 1992, and trained specialists to study the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Іван Гвать |url=http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/24433107.html |title=Україна в лещатах російських спецслужб |publisher=Radiosvoboda.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies were financially supported by the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Ukrainian politicians do not recognise [[Rusyns]] as a separate ethnicity, regardless of Rusyn self-identification. Ukraine officially considers Rusyn a dialect of Ukrainian, related to the [[Hutsul#Language|Hutsul dialect of Ukrainian]].

It is not possible to estimate accurately the number of fluent speakers of Rusyn; however, their number is estimated in the tens of thousands.

[[Serbia]] has recognized Rusyn, more precisely [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian Rusyn]], as an official minority language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skupstinavojvodine.gov.rs/?s=aktAPV001&amp;j=EN |title=Statute of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina |publisher=Skupstinavojvodine.gov.rs |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995, Rusyn has been recognized as a [[minority language]] in [[Slovakia]], enjoying the status of an [[official language]] in municipalities where more than 20 percent of the inhabitants speak Rusyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mensiny.vlada.gov.sk/data/files/418.doc|title=Zákon 184/1999 Z. z. o používaní jazykov národnostných menšín |last=Slovenskej Republiky|first=Národná Rada|year=1999|publisher=Zbierka zákonov|language=Slovak|accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rusyn is listed as a protected language by the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] in [[Slovakia]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Romania]].

==Grammars and codification==
There are three Rusyn standard varieties: one in Slovakia, one in Poland, and one in [[Vojvodina]] and Croatia ([[Pannonian Rusyn]]). Pannonian Rusyn was first standardised in 1923, Slovakia (Prešov) Rusyn in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taraskuzio.net/Nation%20and%20State%20Building_files/national-rusyns.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327140741/http://www.taraskuzio.net/Nation%20and%20State%20Building_files/national-rusyns.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Poland (Lemko) Rusyn in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://theses.gla.ac.uk/2781/1/2011BaptieMPhil-1.pdf, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Carpathian Rusyn alphabets==

Each of the three Rusyn standard varieties has its own [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] alphabet. The table below shows the alphabet of Slovakia (Prešov) Rusyn. The alphabet of the other Carpathian Rusyn standard, Lemko (Poland) Rusyn, differs from it only by lacking [[ё]] and [[ї]]. For the [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian Rusyn]] alphabet, see [[Pannonian Rusyn language#Writing system]].

===Number of letters and relationship to the Ukrainian alphabet===

The Prešov Rusyn alphabet of Slovakia has 36 letters. It includes all the letters of the [[Ukrainian alphabet]] plus [[ё]], [[ы]], and [[ъ]].

The Lemko Rusyn alphabet of Poland has 34 letters. It includes all the Ukrainian letters with the exception of [[ї]], plus ы and ъ.

The [[Pannonian Rusyn language#Writing system|Pannonian Rusyn alphabet]] has 32 letters, namely all the Ukrainian letters except [[і]].

===Alphabetical order===


The Rusyn alphabets all place [[ь]] after [[я]], like the [[Ukrainian alphabet]] did until 1990. The vast majority of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabets]] place ь before [[э]] (if present), [[ю]], and я.

The Lemko and Prešov Rusyn alphabets place [[ъ]] at the very end, while the vast majority of Cyrillic alphabets place it after [[щ]]. They also place [[ы]] before [[й]], while the vast majority of Cyrillic alphabets place it after [[ш]], щ (if present), and ъ (if present).

In the Prešov Rusyn alphabet, [[і]] and [[ї]] come before [[и]], and likewise, і comes before и in the Lemko Rusyn alphabet (which doesn't have ї). In the Ukrainian alphabet, however, и precedes і and ї, and the [[Pannonian Rusyn language#Writing system|Pannonian Rusyn alphabet]] (which doesn't have і) follows this precedent by placing и before ї.

'''Southampton''' is a community on the shores of [[Lake Huron]] in [[Bruce County, Ontario|Bruce County]], Ontario, Canada and close to [[Port Elgin, Ontario|Port Elgin]]. It is located at the mouth of the [[Saugeen River]]. The size of the town is 6.44 square kilometres. The permanent population in 2016 was 3,678 but the summer population is higher, due to cottagers and campers spending vacation time in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Tab=1&amp;Geo1=POPC&amp;Code1=1176&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=35&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Southampton&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;TABID=1 |title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Southampton |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website=StatsCan |publisher=Government of Canada |access-date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the community still has its own post office, and road signs indicating the name Southampton, it is no longer an entity, per se. In 1998, [[Port Elgin, Ontario|Port Elgin]], Southampton and [[Saugeen Township, Ontario|Township of Saugeen]], all along the shores of Lake Huron, were amalgamated to form the Town of Port Elgin-Saugeen-Southampton. On December 17, 1998, the Province renamed the community the Town of [[Saugeen Shores]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saugeenshores.ca/en/our-town-hall/our-history.asp |title=Our History |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website=Town of Saugeen Shores |publisher=Town of Saugeen Shores |access-date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary employment categories are agriculture, small business, tourism and the [[Bruce Power]] nuclear power station which is 40 kilometres away. Southampton is a [[bedroom community]], a retirement destination, as well as a tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saugeenshores.ca/en/our-town-hall/our-history.asp |title=Our History |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website=Town of Saugeen Shores |publisher=Town of Saugeen Shores |access-date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Image:Walker House.jpg|left|thumb|The Walker House, a historic hotel in the village since the 1860s.]]

Long before settlers arrived to the area, Southampton was an important trading area, according to a historic plaque erected in town by the Government of Ontario, titled Fur Trading at Saugeen:

{{quote|The [[Anishinaabe|Anishnabe]] lived by the mouth of the [[Saugeen River]] before [[Pierre Piché]] arrived in 1818 to begin fur trading in the region. By 1826, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] established an outpost at Saguingue to compete with independent fur traders like Piché. From [[La Cloche]], its main post on Lake Huron, the Hudson's Bay Company employed First Nations, Métis, French, and British fur traders who largely depended on Anishnabe hunters to supply deer, bear and marten skins. By 1832, the supply of premium furs was exhausted and the company closed its post. Although many Anishnabe gave up hunting and settled in an agricultural village, fur trading continued here until the mid-19th century when Southampton was founded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waynecook.com/abruce.html |title=Historical Plaques of Bruce County |last=Cook |first=Wayne |date= 2013 |website=Wayne Cook |publisher=Wayne Cook |access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The community was originally known as Saugeen by the early residents, by the Canadian Post Office and by Custom House Departments. However, the Crown Land Departments labelled the village as Southampton and the name stuck as the town was incorporated, named after [[Southampton]], the [[England|English]] sea port. The first European settlers of the area, around 1848, were Captain John Spence and William Kennedy, who wanted to establish a fishing company.&lt;ref name="Robertson 1906 509"&gt;{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=Norman |date=1906 |title=The History of the County of Bruce |url=http://www.brucecountyhistory.on.ca/publications/publications.html |location=Owen Sound |publisher=Books on Demand |page=509 |isbn=5519009104 |quote=A comprehensive history of the county and its municipalities from the early beginnings to 1906.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it proved unfruitful, Spence became a sailor and Kennedy joined a search for the Arctic explorer, [[Sir John Franklin]]. Nevertheless, in 1851 there were at least a dozen families living in the community.&lt;ref name="Robertson, 509"&gt;Robertson, 509.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the Post Office was established, the first and only in [[Bruce County, Ontario|Bruce County]] for several years.&lt;ref name="Robertson 1906 509"/&gt;  Three years later, a [[Bank of Upper Canada]] was built.

In 1846, ''Smith's Canadian Gazetteer'' describes Saugeen (Southampton) as little more than a pioneer settlement:

{{quote|A Settlement of Chippewa Indians, near the month of the Saugeen River, on Lake Huron. ... [[Francis Bond Head|Sir F. Head]], in 1836, obtained a surrender of that vast tract of land ... containing about 1,600,000 acres. ... There are some good log houses, and several comfortable bark shanties. On the hill, in rear of the flats, are several fine fields of corn and potatoes. ... The fishing is very productive, and has attracted the notice of the white people ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

Rowsell |pages=165-166}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The pioneers of Southampton wanted the village to become the county town or [[county seat]], as the village held the only Crown Land Department and Post Office in the county. However, the town of [[Kincardine, Ontario|Kincardine]] had a larger population and seemed the strongest rival. Furthermore, Southampton did not have enough population to meet the requirements for incorporation.  The town petitioned the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] and the elective officials passed an exceptional Act of Incorporation on July 24, 1858 to allow the community to be considered for the county seat. Despite their efforts, [[Walkerton, Ontario|Walkerton]] eventually won the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=Norman |date=1906 |title=The History of the County of Bruce |url=http://www.brucecountyhistory.on.ca/publications/publications.html |location=Owen Sound |publisher=Books on Demand |page=511 |isbn=5519009104 |quote=A comprehensive history of the county and its municipalities from the early beginnings to 1906.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1800s, John Denny built a dam, a grist mill, a sawmill, a woolen mill and an inn on the Saugeen River. (Only the latter building remains at 484 Carlisle Street; the current dam was built in the 1970s.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saugeenshores.ca/en/our-town-hall/resources/Driving-Tour-Brochure-Final.pdf |title=Driving Tour |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2015 |website=Saugeen Shores |publisher=Town of Saugeen Shores |access-date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chantry Island Lightstation Tower]] was completed in April 1859, first lit on April 1, with Duncan McGregor Lambert as the first keeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=1048 |title=Chantry Island |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2014 |website=Chantry Island, ON |publisher=Lighthouse Friends |access-date=28 February 2017 |quote=Robert Mills cared for the tower’s temporary light for a season before Duncan McGregor Lambert, who had many years of maritime experience, took charge of the light in 1858.

Records from 1869 indicate that the population had increased to 600. Large amount of wheat, pork and lumber were being shipped from the village. A bank agency was operating. Good roads were available to other communities. A steam ship made runs to Goderich and Collingwood in summer; stagecoaches operated in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McEvoy |first=Henry |date=1869 |title=Province of Ontario Gazetteer and Directory |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=z6wOAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Province+of+Ontario+Gazetteer+and+Directory:+Containing+Concise+...&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil1tvW7cTTAhXE6YMKHbyTA9cQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Province%20of%20Ontario%20Gazetteer%20and%20Directory%3A%20Containing%20Concise%20...&amp;f=false |location=Toronto |publisher=Robertson &amp; Cook |page=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southampton was incorporated as a town in 1904; at the time, its population was over 2400. The economic base included commercial fishing, warehousing, furniture factories, a tannery and mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southamptonontario.org/history |title=History |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2015 |website=Southampton Residents' Association |publisher=Southampton Residents' Association |access-date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town built a hospital in 1947, a post office in 1952, a library in 1956, an arena in 1961 (replaced in 1977) and a new firehall in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southamptonontario.org/history |title=History |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2015 |website=Southampton Residents' Association |publisher=Southampton Residents' Association |access-date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, a historically significant shipwreck was discovered on the beach. Relics of the ship, "General Hunter," can be found in the Bruce County Museum.

==Economy==
Tourism drives the economy but the Bruce Nuclear plant in nearby [[Tiverton, Ontario]] is major employer. In 2016, the [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]] started a $13 billion refurbishment program in 2016 which will provide employment for many residents and maintain demand for other services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Learment |first=Frances |date=28 February 2017 |title=Bright future for Saugeen Shores |url=http://www.shorelinebeacon.com/2017/02/28/bright-future-for-saugeen-shores | work=Shoreline Beacon |location=Southampton, Ontario |access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bruce Power]], this multi-year plan "will generate between 1,500 and 2,500 jobs on site annually – and 18,000 across Ontario directly and indirectly – while injecting up to $4 billion annually into Ontario’s economy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brucepower.com/bruce-powers-unit-1-sets-new-post-refurbishment-long-run-record/ |title=Unit 1 sets new post-refurbishment long run record |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=14 April 2016 |website=Bruce Power |publisher=Bruce Power |access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
[[File:Southampton Beach.jpg|thumb|Beach at Southampton, Ontario]]

This area of the [[Lake Huron]] shore is famous for its very long, beautiful, sand beaches and picturesque sunsets.

Every Friday night in from mid June to early September, a bagpiper plays under the "Big Flag" at the foot of High Street on Friday evenings, a tradition which started in the late 1990s. During the months of July and August there are "Ghost Walks" available every Tuesday night with Katherine Leonard &amp; Raymond Harrison. These commence at sunset at the foot of High St at the "Big Flag". During the summer and early fall, the beaches are full of people who have come to see the colourful sunsets lighting up the sky over the lake. Southampton, a popular summer getaway, is close to [[Chantry Island (Ontario)|Chantry Island]], Port Elgin, [[Saugeen First Nation]] which holds a PowWow in August each year, and [[Sauble Beach, Ontario|Sauble Beach]]. Every Thursday evening from early June to late August, a Cruise Nite is held; the classic cars park downtown on High St. near the lake shore. Concerts are held at Fairy Lake at least one evening per week in summer.&lt;ref name="Attractions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://visitsouthampton.ca/things-to-do/attractions |title=Attractions in Southampton |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website=Visit Southampton |publisher= Tourist Town Online Solutions|access-date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Harbour range lighthouse, Southampton, ON.jpg|thumb|Harbour Range light, one of the first designated under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act]]
Fishing is popular in this area in the nearby Saugeen River, at Denny's Dam and in Lake Huron. The Chantry Chinook Classic Salmon Derby is held each summer, usually from about mid July to the second week of August.&lt;ref name="Attractions"/&gt; The contest's weigh stations are located in Saugeen Shores and in two other Lake Huron communities, [[Kincardine, Ontario]], and [[Wiarton, Ontario]].

The Bruce County Museum &amp; Cultural Centre provides displays about local history and in summer especially, offers adult and children's programming and special events. These are listed in the Shoreline Beacon community newspaper. The museum has been enlarged over the years and was recently renovated. In addition to a settlers cabin, the facility houses numerous historic artifacts from the area, genealogical records, county newspapers, photographs, and municipal documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brucemuseum.ca/plan-a-visit/about-us/ |title=About Us |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website=Bruce Museum |publisher=BCM&amp;CC |access-date=28 February 2017 |quote=promotes the depth and diversity of our heritage; offers many activities that encourage meaningful reflection on the past in order to better understand the present and thus plan for the future; promotes the value of its collection and archives as a prime resource for research at all levels of learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During July and August, seven days a week, the S.S. Trolley shuttles passengers between downtown Port Elgin and Southampton along the roadway for a modest fee.&lt;ref name="Attractions"/&gt;

The [[Chantry Island Lightstation Tower]] was built in 1859; the tower, keeper's cottage, boat house and dock have been fully restored. The island is a federal Migratory Bird Sanctuary and access is prohibited except with the single licensed tour operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://explorethebruce.com/profile/chantry-island-lighthouse-tour/855/ |title=Chantry Island Lighthouse Tour|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=Chantry Explore the Bruce |publisher=Bruce County}}&lt;/ref&gt; From late-May to mid-September, tours of the lightstation facilities are available several times a week. They leave on the Marine Heritage Society's boat from the ticket office by the fishing boat docks at the harbour.

Three other local lighthouses have been designated under the [[Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act]]: McNab Point and both the Front and Rear Range lights at the River Front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/news/archive/2012/08/government-canada-designates-heritage-lighthouses-nova-scotia-ontario-689589.html?=undefined&amp;wbdisable=true |title=First designations under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=3 August 2012 |website=Government of Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |access-date=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saugeen Rail Trail===
After the railways ceased to service the area, the tracks were removed and the beds were vacant and overgrown. A group of volunteers founded the Saugeen RailTrail Association in 1990, and convinced Port Elgin, Southampton and Saugeen Township to acquire sections of the then unused rail bed. Over the years, the bed has been developed as trails for walking and cycling. The trail connects Southampton and Port Elgin. The trail also connects to the 80 kilometre long Bruce County Trail Network which leads to towns such as Paisley, Walkerton, Mildmay and Kincardine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brucecountytrails.com/trail.php?Trail=17 |title=Bruce County Rail Trail - # 17 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=Bruce County Trails |publisher=Bruce County Trails |access-date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailhead can be accessed at River Street in Port Elgin, a few blocks north of the town centre and east of Hwy 21. There are other access points in both towns, some with parking. The trail is not groomed for cross country skiing during the winter but is used frequently for that purpose. Maps of the trails are available on the web site of the Saugeen Railtrail Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://saugeenrailtrail.ca |title=The Rail Trail |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website=SAUGEEN RAILTRAIL ASSOCIATION |publisher=SAUGEEN RAILTRAIL ASSOCIATION |access-date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10922">The '''Tagea Brandt ''Rejselegat'' (Travel Scholarship)''' is a Danish award to women who have made a significant contribution in science, literature or art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Samfund/Legater_og_fonde/Tagea_Brandts_Rejselegat Denstoredanske.dk] The Grand Danish Encyclopedia, Tagea Brandts Rejselegat (''in Danish'')&lt;/ref&gt; The grant, which is given without application, was created and endowed by Danish industrialist [[Vilhelm Brandt]] (1854–1921) in 1905 in honor of his wife, [[Tagea Brandt]].
It is awarded annually on 17 March,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.litteraturpriser.dk/pris/tbrandt.htm Litteraturpriser.dk] Tagea Brandts Rejselegat&lt;/ref&gt; her birthday.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.gravsted.dk/person.php?navn=tageabrandt|title=Tagea Brandt|publisher=|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The charter of 1922 provides that it shall be given to outstanding women in science, art, music, literature and theater arts (particularly in this case to actresses at the [[Royal Danish Theatre]]).&lt;ref name="kvbio"/&gt; The intent is for the awardee to both broaden her horizons while promoting Danish society abroad, and to benefit from vacation and rest time.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The first scholarships were given in 1924; the first time the amount was DKK 10.000, in 1958 it was increased to DKK 15.000, in 1967 to 25.000, later to 50.000 and currently it is DKK 75.000, which usually is given to 2-3 women annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Samfund/Legater_og_fonde/Tagea_Brandts_Rejselegat Denstoredanske.dk]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{War}}

In modern [[military parlance]], to '''take point''', '''walk point''', be '''on point''', or be a '''point man''' means to assume the first and most exposed position in a combat military formation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/support-weapons/17927.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKgzKZWI?url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/support-weapons/17927.aspx |archivedate=2010-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the leading soldier or unit advancing through hostile or unsecured territory.&lt;ref name="knives"&gt;[http://www.knives.com/language.html Céileachair, Daithí Ó (2005) "Language and Knives"];&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/8/P0400800.html "Point" definition 30a &amp; b ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (4th ed.)  2000]&lt;/ref&gt; The term can be applied to [[infantry]] or mechanized columns. The soldier, vehicle, or unit on point is frequently the first to take hostile fire. The inherent risks of taking point create a need for constant and extreme operational alertness. However, [[ambush]]es often intend to let the point element past the prime [[killing zone]] in order to be maximally effective. Point position is often rotated periodically so as not to overtax the individual soldier/unit.

==History==

===Origins===
The term might be related to the [[Middle English]] phrase "in point", which meant "in immediate danger or peril".&lt;ref name = "Mavens"&gt;{{cite web 
| url = http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20001017 
| title = The Mavens' Word of the Day: point man 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern use of the term derives from military tactics. During a military patrol or infantry operation, the point man is a navigator who walks several meters out in front of everyone else and is likely to be the first one to encounter enemy soldiers. It is a hazardous position that requires alertness and ability to deal with unexpected attacks.

The term was used in the 19th century [[American Old West]] when the lead [[cowboy]] at the front of a herd of cattle was known as the '''pointer''' or point man. It may have come into common use because many of the cowboys in the late 1800s were veterans of the [[American Civil War]]. In cavalry terminology, the men scouting ahead of the main force were said to be "riding point". This use was first recorded in 1903.&lt;ref name = "Mavens" /&gt;

The concept seems to have been introduced to the American military at [[West Point]] by Professor Dennis H. Mahan, who taught most of the top officers on both sides in the Civil War. In his ''Elementary Treatise on Advanced-Guard, Out-Post and Detachment Service of Troops (1861)'', he discussed the use of the column or V-shaped advance guard by the Greeks and Romans:

{{quote|Among the orders of battles among the ancients, that known as the wedge, or boar's head, is the most celebrated. In this disposition, the '''point''', or '''head''', is formed of a subdivision of the [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] of greater or less strength, according to circumstances; this being supported by two, three, and four subdivisions of the same force, one behind another.}}

In the section on ''Advanced Guards and Advanced Posts'', Professor Mahan introduced the  definition of the point man to the future American generals:

{{quote|From these indications of the manner of distributing the troops of the advanced-guard, the following general dispositions, adapted to ordinary circumstances of locality may be gathered.  The apex, or most advanced point, may be formed of a staff, or other intelligent officer, under the escort of a few horsemen...}}

===Modern use===
"Take point" came into common use during [[World War II]] by American ground forces; its use continued through the [[Korean War]], [[Vietnam War]] and [[Iraq War]]. This idiom, "take point" has entered the vernacular in many ways. "Taking point" is often used in describing pathfinding behaviors in non-military situations, or simply to mean "lead the challenge", often in a business context.&lt;ref name="knives" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proz.com/glossary-translations/english-to-dutch-translations/87 "to walk point" English to Dutch Marketing/Market Research idioms];&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases it has replaced the idiom "[[stalking horse]]".

More recently (possibly originating from the late 1960s), the term has been extended to describe someone at the forefront of an issue. It can be used to refer to both the defender or the attacker of the position or idea. This use is most often used in a political context, as the point man is usually in the public eye.

In recent American youth (especially [[hip hop]]) culture, the idiom "on point" refers either to someone who possesses abundant and various qualities of competence, leadership or style, or to specific acts which demonstrate such qualities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/cultureshock/fa2003/essays/lashaunta.html Urban Wear: Hip-Hop Culture as Identity] by Lashaunta Santos at MIT's [http://web.mit.edu/cultureshock/fa2003/index.html Cultureshock] group weblog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/dominant_g/index2.html Interview with DominantG]  on [http://www.ukhh.com/index.html UKHH.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Especially profound lyrics, a particular musical performance or a philosophical position might be referred to as "on point." This varies somewhat from the traditional meaning of the phrase, "directly applicable or dispositive of the matter under consideration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/on+point&amp;r=67 On Point definition] at [http://www.answers.com/ Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
* In (American) politics, a point man is someone leading the defense of a political position.
* In the commission of crime, usually a [[robbery]], a "point man" is a lookout.
* [[Gun dog]]s and [[hunting dog]]s, such as the [[pointing breed]], "makes/comes to a point" by standing rigid and facing the game.
* In [[ice hockey]] the point man is the defense man on the blue line of the offensive position in the "attacking zone", meaning that he is usually farther from the net than any other skater (almost the exact opposite of what point man means in the military); in [[basketball]] the [[point guard]] directs the team's offense in the front court.&lt;ref name = "Mavens" /&gt;
* In [[ballet]], the term [[en pointe]] refers to the act of standing on the points of the toes while performing steps

Unless otherwise indicated, [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] [[verb]]s in this article are given in the usual [[citation form]], the third person singular masculine perfect.

==Roots==
A [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] verb [[root]] consists of a set of [[consonant]]s (or "literals"), usually three, for example, {''sbr''} 'break' (citation form: ሰበረ ''säbärä''), {''drf''} 'sing' (citation form: ደረፈ ''däräfä'').
Each three-consonant (or "triliteral") root belongs to one of three [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] classes, conventionally known as A, B, and C, and analogous to the three conjugations of verbs in [[Romance language]]s.  This division is a basic feature of [[Ethiopian Semitic languages]].
Most three-consonant roots are in the A class (referred to in this article as "3A").  In the citation form (perfect), these have no gemination and the vowel ''ä'' between both pairs of consonants.  Examples are ሰበረ ''säbärä'' and ደረፈ ''däräfä''.  The B class (referred to in this article as "3B") is distinguished by the gemination of the second consonant in all forms.  Examples are ደቀሰ ''dä'''k'k''''äsä'' 'sleep' and ወሰኸ ''wä'''ss'''äxä'' 'add'.
The relatively few members of the C class (referred to in this article as "3C") take the vowel ''a'' between the first and second consonants.  Examples are ባረኸ ''b'''a'''räxä'' 'bless' and ናፈቐ ''n'''a'''fäx'ä'' 'long for, miss'.

Tigrinya also has a significant number of four-consonant (or "quadriliteral") roots (referred to in this article as "4").
These fall into a single conjugation class.
Examples are መስከረ ''mäskärä'' 'testify' and ቀልጠፈ ''k'ält'äfä'' 'hurry'.

The language also has five-consonant (or "quinquiliteral") roots (referred to in this article as "5").  Most, if not all, of these are "defective" in the sense described below; that is, their simplest form takes the ''tä-'' prefix.  Examples are ተንቀጥቀጠ ''tä-nk'ät'k'ät'ä'' 'tremble' and ተምበርከኸ ''tä-mbärkäxä'' 'kneel'.

As is common in Semitic languages, roots containing "laryngeal" (that is, pharyngeal or glottal) consonants in any position or semivowels (''y'' or ''w'') in any but first position undergo various modifications.  These are dealt with below under Conjugation.

==Derivation==
Each verb root can be modified through one or more basic [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]al processes.  Each can be described in terms of its form and its function.

===Form===
Changes to the root form are of two types: [[affix|prefixes]] and internal changes.

The prefixes are ''tä-'' and ''’a-'' or their combination.  When the prefix ''tä-'' follows ''’a-'', it loses its vowel and [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilates]] to the following consonant (that is, the first root consonant).  Without ''’a-'' its realization depends on the tense/aspect/mood of the verb.

Internal changes are of two types.  One is a form of [[reduplication]].  This produces an extra [[syllable]], consisting of a copy of the second consonant from the end of the root followed by the vowel ''a''; this syllable appears third from the end of the verb stem.  A second type of internal change inserts the vowel ''a'', or replaces the existing vowel with ''a'', following the third consonant from the end of the stem.  For three-consonant roots, this results in a pattern similar to that of C class verbs.

The table below shows the possible combinations of prefixes and internal changes and their functions, illustrating each with the verb {''sbr''} (3A).

===Function===
For the most part, the two derivational prefixes signal [[grammatical voice]]; that is, they govern how the participants in the sentence map onto the roles in the event conveyed by the verb.  With neither prefix, the verb is normally in &lt;small&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/small&gt; voice; the subject is the agent of the event.  By itself, the prefix ''tä-'' usually signals &lt;small&gt;PASSIVE&lt;/small&gt; voice or [[reflexive voice|&lt;small&gt;REFLEXIVE&lt;/small&gt; voice]].  Some participant which is not the subject of the active sentence, the patient or recipient, becomes the subject; or the subject is both the agent and the patient or recipient of the event.  By itself, the prefix ''’a-'' usually signals [[causative voice|&lt;small&gt;CAUSATIVE&lt;/small&gt; voice]]; the subject of the sentence is then a causer of the event who is not the immediate agent.

Reduplication with neither of the prefixes signals [[frequentative|&lt;small&gt;FREQUENTATIVE&lt;/small&gt;]], the repetition of the event conveyed by the verb.  Together with the prefix ''tä-'', reduplication and internal ''-a-'' both signal [[reciprocal (grammar)|&lt;small&gt;RECIPROCAL&lt;/small&gt;]]; the subject, most often plural, represents both the agent and patient or recipient of the event.  In English, and some other languages, the reciprocal is marked by a pronoun, 'each other'.  The addition of ''’a-'' to this patterns yields the &lt;small&gt;RECIPROCAL CAUSATIVE&lt;/small&gt;: 'cause to DO to each other'.

Here are examples of the different derivational patterns, using the roots {''sbr''} (3A) 'break', {''ls'y''} (3C) 'shave', and ''sḥk'' (3A) 'laugh'.  The verbs are all in the gerundive tense/aspect form.
* መስኮት ሰቢሩ ''mäskot säbiru'' 'He broke a window'; {''sbr''}, no prefix, no internal change, &lt;small&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/small&gt;
* መስኮት (ብተኽሉ) ተሰቢሩ ''mäskot (bǝtäxlu) '''tä'''-säbiru'' 'a window was broken (by Teklu)'; {''sbr''}, ''tä-'', no internal change, &lt;small&gt;PASSIVE&lt;/small&gt;
* መስኮት ሰባቢሩ ''mäskot sä'''ba'''biru'' 'He repeatedly broke windows'; {''sbr''}, no prefix, reduplication, &lt;small&gt;FREQUENTATIVE&lt;/small&gt;
* መስኮት ኣስቢሩ ''mäskot '''’a'''-sbiru'' 'He caused a window to be broken (by somebody else)'; {''sbr''}, ''’a-'', no internal change, &lt;small&gt;CAUSATIVE&lt;/small&gt;
* ተላጺዩ '''''tä'''-las'iyu'' 'He shaved (himself)'; {''ls'y''}, ''tä-'', no internal change, &lt;small&gt;REFLEXIVE&lt;/small&gt;
* ተሳሒቖም '''''tä'''-s'''a'''ḥix'om'' / ተሰሓሒቖም '''''tä'''-sä'''ḥa'''ḥix'om'' 'they (m.) laughed at each other'; '''sḥk''', ''tä-'', ''-a-'' / reduplication, &lt;small&gt;RECIPROCAL&lt;/small&gt;
* ኣሳሒቑዎም '''''’a'''-'''s'''-s'''a'''ḥix'uwwom'' /  ኣሰሐሒቑዎም '''''’a'''-'''s'''-sä'''ḥa'''ḥix'uwwom'' 'he made them (m.) laugh at each other'; {''sḥk'''}, ''’a-'' + ''tä-'', ''-a-'' / reduplication, &lt;small&gt;RECIPROCAL CAUSATIVE&lt;/small&gt;

===Defective verbs===
Some verb roots are [[defective verb|defective]] in the sense that they must occur with either or both of the derivational prefixes.  For example, from the root {''k'mt'''} (3B) 'sit' there are the forms ''täx'ämmät'ä'' 'sit', ''ax'ämmät'ä'' 'cause to sit, put' but no form *''k'ämmät'ä''.  Other examples: {''ktl''} (3B) ''täxättälä'' 'follow', {''zrb''} (3C) ''täzaräbä'' 'speak', {''ggy''} (3C) ''tägagäyä'' 'err'.  Note that the ''tä-'' does not necessarily signify passive or reflexive with these verbs.

==Tense, aspect, and mood==
The pattern of vowels between the consonants of a verb root, as well as the gemination of one or more consonants in some cases, is determined in part by the verb class (3A, 3B, 3C, 4, 5) and the presence (or absence) of derivational morphemes (&lt;small&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;PASSIVE&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;RECIPROCAL&lt;/small&gt;, etc.).  But it also depends on the selection of the tense/aspect or mood.

Most Semitic languages make a basic two-way distinction between a [[grammatical tense|tense]]/[[grammatical aspect|aspect]] stem that is conjugated with suffixes and another stem that is conjugated with prefixes and, in some forms, suffixes as well.
In Ethiopian Semitic and in Arabic, the first, known as the '''perfect''', is used for past tense, and the second, known as the '''imperfect''', is used for present and sometimes future tenses.
In Tigrinya the bare imperfect is used mainly for the habitual present: ኩሉ መዓልቲ መስኮት ይሰብር ''kullu mä‘alti mäskot yǝsäbbǝr'' 'he breaks a window every day'.  In other present and future contexts, auxiliaries are usually used along with the imperfect.

Ethiopian Semitic and [[Arabic]] verbs also have a third possibility, which like the imperfect is conjugated with prefixes and sometimes suffixes.  This form, known as the '''jussive/imperative''', is tenseless; it is used to express the [[imperative mood]] in the second person as well as notions such as 'let him DO', 'that he DO' in the first and third persons.  In Ethiopian Semitic, the affirmative imperative drops the prefix, but the negative imperative maintains it.  For example, in Tigrinya ንስበር ''nǝ-sbär'' 'let's break', ስበራ ''sǝbär-a'' 'break! (2p.f.pl.)', ኣየትስበራ ''ay-tǝ-sbär-a'' 'don't break! (2p.f.pl.)'.

Some Ethiopian Semitic languages, including Tigrinya, have a fourth possibility, known (somewhat confusingly) as the '''gerund''' or '''gerundive''', which like the perfect is conjugated with suffixes only.  As in Amharic, this form in Tigrinya has a tenseless, linking function: '(after) having DONE...', '...DO and (then)...'.  In Tigrinya it has an additional and very important function: it is the usual way to express the affirmative past tense in [[independent clause]]s, the perfect being restricted mainly to the past negative and to verbs preceded by subordinating conjunctions and the relativizer ''zǝ-''.

==Conjugation==
Tigrinya has separate suffixes, prefixes, or combinations of prefixes and suffixes for each of the ten person/number/gender combinations that are distinguished within the [[#Personal pronouns|personal pronoun]] system.  These are illustrated in the table below for the verb {''flt'''} (3A) 'know' in its &lt;small&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/small&gt; form, that is, without derivational prefixes or internal changes.

For the second person jussive/imperative, the ''tǝ-'' prefix appears in parentheses because it is used only in the negative.
Note that for verbs in the 3A class, the second consonant is geminated in the imperfect when there is no suffix.

The same subject agreement affixes appear in the various derivational patterns, but the verb stems are not predictable from the simple, &lt;small&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/small&gt; stems.

The derivational prefixes ''tä-'' and ''’a-'' undergo various changes when they are preceded by subject agreement affixes.  In the imperative/jussive, ''tä-'' assimilates to the first consonant of the verb root (except when there is no prefix in the affirmative imperative).  In the imperfect, ''tä-'' disappears altogether, though its presence can still be detected from the pattern of vowels and gemination in the verb stem.  The first person imperfect and jussive prefix ''’ǝ'' merges with a following ''’a-'', and the vowel of the other prefixes (''tǝ'', ''yǝ'', ''nǝ'') merges with a following ''’a-'', yielding the vowel ''-ä''.

The perfect stem following ''tä-'' may lose the vowel between the second and third root consonants when the suffix begins with a vowel (ተፈልጠ ''tä-fält'-ä'' 'he was known'; ተፈለጥኩ ''tä-fälät'-ku'' 'I was known').

The table below shows forms for the verb {''flt'''} (3A) 'know' in each of the possible combinations of derivational prefixes and internal changes.  Unless otherwise indicated, the forms given are the third person masculine plural for the &lt;small&gt;RECIPROCAL&lt;/small&gt; pattern and the third person masculine singular for the other patterns.

The subject agreement affixes are the same for verbs in other conjugation classes, but the stems differ in some cases from what would be expected for a verb in the 3A class like ''fälät'ä''.  The table below shows the third person singular masculine &lt;small&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/small&gt; forms for verbs in other classes: {''bdl''} (3B) 'offend', {''mrk''} (3C) 'capture', {''t'rt'r''} (4) 'doubt'.

Verbs whose roots contain "laryngeal" (pharyngeal or glottal: ''‘'', ''ḥ'', ''’'', ''h'') consonants in any position or semivowels (''w'' or ''y'') in any position other than first deviate in various ways from the patterns shown in the tables above.  For the laryngeals, most of these [[deviations]] stem from the fact that the vowel ''ä'' never occurs immediately after a laryngeal.  For the semivowels, the deviations result from simplifications that occur when these consonants are preceded and followed by vowels.  Some of the changes are illustrated in the following table for these seven verbs, all in the 3A class: {''hdm''} 'escape', {''s‘m''} 'kiss', {''srḥ''} 'do, work', {''mwt''} 'die', {''ftw''} 'like', {''kyd''} 'go', {''sty''} 'drink'.  There is considerable variation in the forms; only one possibility is shown here.  Third person singular masculine is given in each case, and in addition the first person singular (in the perfect) or third person masculine plural (in the imperfect) for cases where the stem changes within the paradigm.

The very common verbs {''nbr''} 'live, be' and {''gbr''} 'do' undergo simplifications in the gerundive, where the ''b'' is deleted: ነይሩ ''näyru'', ገይሩ ''gäyru'' (3p.m.sg.); ኔርካ ''nerka'', ጌርካ ''gerka'' (2p.m.sg.); etc.

Tigrinya has four genuinely [[irregular verbs]]: {''bhl''} 'say', {''whb''} 'give', {''tḥz''} 'hold', and {''hlw''} 'exist'.  For the first three of these, which are conjugated similarly, the third personal singular masculine forms are shown in the following table.  The verb of existence is discussed in a separate section.

==Object suffixes==
Like other Semitic languages, Tigrinya has object pronoun suffixes that can appear on verbs in any tense-aspect-mood.
As discussed under [[#Personal pronouns|personal pronouns]], there are two sets of such suffixes in the language, a set used for direct objects and a "prepositional" set used for [[dative case|dative]], [[benefactive case|benefactive]], [[locative case|locative]], or adversative meanings ('to', 'for', 'against'); only one object suffix is permitted on a given verb.

As in some other Ethiopian Semitic languages, there are separate "light" and "heavy" suffixes for all but the second person and first-person plural prepositional object forms.  The light suffixes (''-ni'', ''-xa'', etc.) are characterized by initial [[gemination|ungeminated]] [[consonant]]s and the heavy suffixes (''-nni'', ''-kka'', etc.) by initial geminated consonants.  For the third person direct object suffixes, there is a third form with no initial consonant at all (''-o'', ''-a'', etc.). Roughly speaking, the light suffixes are used with verbs whose subjects are second or third person plural, the third person vowel-initial suffixes are used with verbs that have no agreement suffix, and the heavy suffixes are used in other cases. In the jussive/imperative, the vowel-initial suffixes cause the gemination of the preceding consonant. When an object suffix beginning with a consonant is added to a verb ending in a consonant (either a root or a suffix consonant), a vowel is inserted to break up the cluster, the particular vowel depending on the subject and object. The details are quite complicated; most of the possibilities are illustrated in the following table for two different object and four different subject categories, using the verb ''fälät'ä'' (3A) 'know'.

==Negation==
Verbs are negated in Tigrinya with the prefix ኣይ ''ay-'' and, in independent tensed clauses, the suffix ን ''-n''. The negative prefix precedes any derivational or subject agreement prefixes, and the negative suffix follows any subject agreement or object pronoun suffixes.  The first person singular imperfect and jussive prefix ''’ǝ'' is dropped following ''ay-''.  The gerundive has no negative; the negative of the perfect is used instead. Examples:
* '''Perfect''': ተዓጸወ ''tä‘as'äwä'' 'it was closed', ኣይተዓጸወን ''ay-tä‘as'äwä-n'' 'it wasn't closed'
* '''Imperfect''': ትፈልጥኒ ''tǝfält'ǝnni'' 'you (f.sg.) know me', ኣይትፈልጥንን ''ay-tǝfält'ǝnnǝ-n'' 'you (f.sg.) don't know me'
* '''Imperative''': ክፈቶ ''kǝfätto'' 'open (m.sg.) it', ኣይትክፈቶ ''ay-tǝkfätto'' 'don't open (m.sg.) it'
* '''Gerundive''': ተጋግየ ''tägagǝyä'' 'I made a mistake', ኣይተጋጌኹን ''ay-tägagexu-n'' 'I didn't make a mistake' (perfect)

==Copula and verb of existence==
Like other Ethiopian Semitic languages, Tigrinya has a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ('be') and a separate verb of existence and location ('exist, be located'), neither of which is conjugated like other verbs.
For the present tense, both the copula and the verb of existence use forms with subject agreement suffixes rather than anything resembling the imperfect.
The present of the verb of existence can take conjunctive prefixes, in which case its initial ''’a'' is absorbed: እንተሎ ''ǝntällo'' 'if there is', ዘለዉ ''zälläwu'' 'which there are'.
The copula cannot take conjunctive prefixes; instead, forms of the regular verb ኮነ ''konä'' 'become' are used: እንተኾነ ''ǝntäxonä'' if he is, becomes', ዝኾነ ''zǝxonä'' 'which is, becomes'.
The perfect or gerundive of the regular verb ነበረ ''näbärä'' 'live' normally serves as the past tense of both the copula and the verb of existence: ምሳና ኣይነበረን ''mǝsana aynäbäran'' 'they (f.) weren't with us'.
The verbs ኮነ ''konä'', ነበረ ''näbärä'', and ሃለወ ''halläwä'' (a regular verb with restricted use meaning 'exist' and the historical source of ''allo'', etc.) replace the copula and verb of existence in other grammatical roles: ይኹኑ ''yǝxunu'' 'let them (m.) be' (jussive), ኪነብር እዩ ''kinäbbǝr ǝyyu'' 'he will be (there)' (near future), ምህላውካ ''mǝhǝllawka'' 'your (m.sg.) being (there)' (infinitive).

With object pronoun suffixes, the verb of existence conveys possession; the object represents the possessor and the subject of the verb the possessed entity.  Thus there are four ways to express 'have' for a given subject, depending on the number and gender of the possessed entity: ኣሎኒ ''allo-ni'' (m.sg.), ኣላትኒ ''allat-ǝ-nni'' (f.sg.), ኣለዉኒ ''alläwu-ni'' (m.pl.), ኣለዋኒ ''alläwa-ni'' (f.pl.) 'I have'.  The same form is used to express obligation; the subject takes the form of an infinitive, the subject agreement is third person masculine singular, and the object suffix represents the obliged person: ምድቃስ ኣሎኒ ''mǝdǝqqas allo-nni'', 'I have to sleep'.

The following table shows the affirmative and negative present forms of the copula and verb of existence.  In the second person forms of the copula, the first vowel may be either ''ǝ'' and ''i''.

==Relativization==
Tigrinya forms [[relative clause]]s by prefixing ''zǝ-'' to the perfect or imperfect form of a verb.
The irregular present of the verb of existence (ኣሎ ''’allo'', etc.) may also take the prefix, in which case it combines with the initial ''’a-'' to yield ''zä-'': ዘሎ ''zällo'' 'which exists, is located', etc.
The relativizing prefix precedes subject agreement, derivational, and negative prefixes.
The prefix undergoes the following changes immediately preceding particular prefixes.
* Imperfect and jussive subject agreement prefixes
** ''zǝ-'' + ''’ǝ-'' (1p.sg.): ''zǝ-'', e.g., ዝገብርሉ ''zǝgäbrǝllu'' 'with which I do (it)'
** ''zǝ-'' + ''yǝ-'' (3p.m.sg., 3p.pl.): ''zi-'' or ''zǝ-'', e.g., ዚቈርጹ ''zix'ʷärs'u'' 'which they (m.) cut'
** ''zǝ-'' + ''tǝ-'' (2p., 3p.f.sg.): ''zǝttǝ-'' or ''’ǝttǝ-'', e.g., እትርእያ ''’ǝttǝrǝ’ya'' 'which you (f.pl.) see'
** ''zǝ-'' + ''nǝ-'' (1p.pl.): ''zǝnnǝ-'' or ''’ǝnnǝ-'', e.g., e.g., እንጽሕፍ ''’ǝnnǝs'ǝḥǝf'' 'which we write'
* Derivational prefixes
** ''zǝ-'' + ''’a-'' (causative): ''zä-'', e.g., ዘምጻእኩ ''zäms'a’ku'' 'which I brought (caused to come)'
** ''zǝ-'' + ''tä-'' (passive): ''’ǝttä-'' (or ''zǝtä-''), e.g., እተሓተመ ''’ǝttäḥatämä'' 'which was printed'
* Negative prefix
** ''zǝ-'' + ''’ay-'': ''zäy-'', e.g., ዘይንደሊ ''zäynǝdälli'' 'which we don't want'

Relative clauses may occur without an explicit antecedent: ዝሰበርኩ ''zǝsäbärku'' 'what I broke', ዚብላዕ ''zibǝlla‘'' 'what is eaten'

As in other Ethiopian [[Semitic languages]] very common use of relative clauses is in [[cleft sentence]]s. The main verb of the corresponding unclefted sentence is replaced by a relative clause and copula, and the relative clause often comes last in the sentence.
* ሓፍተይ እያ ዝኸደት ''ḥaftäy ’ǝyya zǝxädät'' 'it is my sister who left' (lit. 'she is my sister who left')
* መን እዩ ዝፈለጠ ''män ǝyyu zǝ-fälät'ä'' 'who knew?' (lit. 'who is he who knew?')

==Auxiliary verbs==
Tigrinya has a complex set of possibilities for expressing [[grammatical tense|tense]] and
[[grammatical aspect|aspect]] distinctions
.&lt;ref&gt;Voigt, Rainer M. (1977) ''Das tigrinische Verbalsystem''. Berlin: Verlag von Dietrich Reimer.&lt;/ref&gt;
Besides the simple perfect, imperfect, and gerundive, other possibilities consist of combinations of these three with different [[auxiliary verb]]s &amp;mdash; the copula (እዩ ''’ǝyyu'', etc.), the present of the verb of existence (ኣሎ ''’allo'', etc.), the verb ነበረ ''näbärä'' 'live, be', the verb ኮነ ''konä'' 'become, be', and the verb ጸንሔ ''s'änḥe'' 'stay' &amp;mdash; and sometimes with particular conjunctive prefixes such as ''kǝ-''.  In most cases both the auxiliary verb and the main verb are conjugated.  Some of the more common patterns are the following:
* imperfect + copula
: The usual present tense for emotion and sense verbs: እፈትዋ እየ ''’ǝfätwa ’ǝyyä'' 'I like her'.
* imperfect + ''näbärä''
: Corresponds to the English past progressive: ንሰቲ ነበርና ''nǝsätti näbärna'' 'we were drinking'.
* gerundive + present of verb of existence or copula
: Corresponds to the English present perfect: መጺኣ ኣላ ''mäs'i’a ’alla'' 'she has come'.
* gerundive + ''näbärä''
: Corresponds to the English past perfect: ከይዶም ነበሩ ''käydom näbäru'' 'they (m.) had gone'
* imperfect + present verb of existence
: Corresponds to English present progressive: ይጻወታ ኣለዋ ''yǝs's'awäta ’alläwa'' 'they (f.) are playing'.  (Note how this differs from the corresponding form in [[Amharic language|Amharic]], which is the normal main clause present tense.)
* ''kǝ-'' + imperfect + copula
: The usual future tense: ክዕድጎ እየ ''kǝ‘ǝddǝgo ’ǝyyä'' 'I'm going to buy it'

{{For|water well wellheads|Puteal}}
A '''wellhead''' is the component at the surface of an [[oil well|oil or gas well]] that provides the structural and pressure-containing interface for the drilling and production equipment.[[File:Wellhead Bohrlochkopf.JPG|thumb|Wellhead gas storage, Etzel Germany]]
[[Image:Wellhead-dual completion.jpg|right|thumb|Oil well Christmas tree]]

The primary purpose of a wellhead is to provide the suspension point and pressure seals for the [[casing string]]s that run from the bottom of the hole sections to the surface pressure control equipment.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Terms/w/wellhead.aspx Schlumberger Limited, oil well]&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[drilling]] the oil well, surface pressure control is provided by a [[blowout preventer]] (BOP). If the pressure is not contained during drilling operations by the column of [[drilling fluid]], casings, wellhead, and BOP, a well [[blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] could occur.

When the well has been drilled, it is [[Completion (oil and gas wells)|completed]] to provide an interface with the reservoir rock and a tubular conduit for the well fluids. The surface pressure control is provided by a [[Christmas tree (oil well)|Christmas tree]], which is installed on top of the wellhead, with [[isolation valve]]s and choke equipment to control the flow of well fluids during production.

Wellheads are typically welded onto the first string of casing, which has been cemented in place during drilling operations, to form an integral structure of the well. In exploration wells that are later abandoned, the wellhead may be recovered for refurbishment and re-use.

Offshore, where a wellhead is located on the [[oil platform|production platform]] it is called a ''surface wellhead'', and if located beneath the water then it is referred to as a [[subsea]] wellhead or mudline wellhead.

&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.croftsystems.net/oil-gas-blog/the-difference-between-a-wellhead-christmas-tree Croft systems, The Difference Between a Wellhead &amp; Christmas Tree, August 29, 2014 ,by Meisa G]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epmag.com/new-wellhead-design-speeds-operations-1364551 New Wellhead Design Speeds Up Operations, Schlumberger company, October 12, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www3.epa.gov/region1/eco/drinkwater/pc_wellhead_protection.html EPA, Wellhead Protection Program ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geoilandgas.com/sfx SFX: Standardized Fatigue-Resistant Wellhead System Solution]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
The primary components of a wellhead system are:
* [[casing head]]
* casing spools
* [[casing hanger]]s
* [[choke manifold]]
* packoffs (isolation) seals
* test plugs
* mudline suspension systems
* tubing heads
* tubing hangers
* tubing head adapter

==Functions==
A wellhead serves numerous functions, some of which are:
#  Provide a means of casing suspension. ([[Casing (borehole)|Casing]] is the permanently installed pipe used to line the well hole for pressure containment and collapse prevention during the drilling phase).
#  Provides a means of tubing suspension. (Tubing is removable pipe installed in the well through which well fluids pass).
#  Provides a means of pressure sealing and isolation between casing at surface when many casing strings are used.
#  Provides pressure monitoring and pumping access to [[Annulus (oil well)|annuli]] between the different casing/tubing strings.
#  Provides a means of attaching a [[blowout preventer]] during drilling.
#  Provides a means of attaching a [[Christmas tree (oil well)|Christmas tree]] for production operations.
#  Provides a reliable means of well access.
#  Provides a means of attaching a well pump,

==Design specification==
The oil industry specifications for wellhead systems (materials, dimensions, test procedures and pressure ratings etc.) are :
#  [[American Petroleum Institute|API]] 6A, 20th Edition, October 2010; Specification for Wellhead and Christmas Tree Equipment
#  [[International Standards Organisation|ISO]] 10423:2009 Wellhead and Christmas Tree Equipment

In general well heads are five nominal ratings of wellheads: 2, 3, 5, 10 and 15 (x1000) psi working pressure. They have an [[operating temperature]] range of -50 to +250 degrees Fahrenheit. They are used in conjunction with ring type seal gaskets.

In general the yield strength of the materials range from 36000 to 75000 psi.

'''Wintuan''' (also '''Wintun''', '''Wintoon''', '''Copeh''', '''Copehan''') is a [[language family|family]] of languages spoken in the [[Sacramento Valley]] of central [[Northern California]].

All Wintuan languages are either [[extinct language|extinct]] or severely [[endangered language|endangered]].

==Classification==

===Family division===

Shipley (1978:89) listed three Wintuan languages in his encyclopedic overview of California Indian languages. More recently Mithun (1999) split Southern Wintuan into a Patwin language and a Southern Patwin language, resulting in the following classification.

I. Northern Wintuan
: 1. '''[[Wintu language|Wintu]]''' (a.k.a. Wintu proper, Northern Wintu) ''(†)''
: 2. '''[[Nomlaki language|Nomlaki]]''' (a.k.a. Noamlakee, Central Wintu) ''(†)''

II. Southern Wintuan
: 3. '''[[Patwin language|Patwin]]''' (a.k.a. Patween)
: 4. '''[[Southern Patwin language|Southern Patwin]]''' ''(†)''

Wintu became extinct with the death of the last fluent speaker in 2003 (Golla 2011:143). Nomlaki has at least one partial speaker (as of 2010, Golla 2011:143). One speaker of Patwin (Hill Patwin dialect) remained in 2003 (Golla 2011:145). Southern Patwin, once spoken by the Suisun local tribe just northeast of San Francisco Bay, became [[extinct language|extinct]] in the early 20th century and is thus poorly known (Golla 2011:146; Mithun 1999). Wintu proper is the best documented of the four Wintuan languages.

Pitkin (1984) estimated that the Wintuan languages were about as close to each other as the [[Romance languages]]. They may have diverged from a common tongue only 2,000 years ago. A comparative study including a reconstruction of Proto-Wintun phonology, morphology and lexicon was undertaken by Shepherd (2006).

===Possible relations to external language families===

The Wintuan family is usually considered to be a member of the hypothetical [[Penutian]] language phylum (Golla 2011:128-168) and was one of the five branches of the original ''California kernel'' of Penutian proposed by Roland B. Dixon and [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] (1913a, 1913b). However, recent studies indicate that the Wintuans independently entered California about 1,500 years ago from an earlier location somewhere in Oregon (Golla 2007:75-78). The Wintuan pronominal system closely resembles that of [[Klamath language|Klamath]], while there are  numerous lexical resemblances between Northern Wintuan and [[Alsean languages|Alsea]] that appear to be loans (Golla 1997; DeLancey and Golla 1997; Liedtke 2007).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5002">'''Zvi Kolitz''' ({{lang-he|צבי קוליץ}}; December 14, 1912 – September 29, 2002) was a Lithuanian-born Jewish film and theatrical producer and a writer whose short story ''[[Yosl Rakover Talks to God]]'' became a classic of [[Holocaust literature]].

==Life==
Zvi Kolitz, a son of a prominent rabbinical family, was born in [[Alytus]], [[Lithuania]]. He studied at the nearby [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)|Yeshiva of Slobodka]] and then lived for several years in Italy, where he attended the [[University of Florence]] and the [[Betar Naval Academy|Naval Academy at Civitavecchia]]. He emigrated to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] before the [[Israeli War of Independence]] and led recruiting efforts for the [[Revisionist Zionism|Zionist Revisionist]] movement. He was arrested by the British and jailed for his political activities. After Israel's independence in 1948, Kolitz became active in the state's literary and cultural life. In 2002, Kolitz died of natural causes in [[New York City|New York]], NY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|title=Zvi Kolitz, 89; Produced Israel's First Film, Wrote Fictional Holocaust Story|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/09/local/me-kolitz9|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=20 August 2013|date=October 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Yosl Rakover Talks to God''==
Kolitz is best known for ''Yosl Rakover Talks to God,'' a short story he wrote in 1946 for a Jewish newspaper in [[Buenos Aires]]. In the story, set in the final days of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], a pious Jew challenges God. ''And so, my God, before I die, freed from all fear, beyond all terror, in a state of absolute inner peace and trust, I will allow myself to call you to account one last time in my life,'' the fictionalized Rakover says, adding later ''I believe in the God of Israel, even when he has done everything to make me cease to believe in him.''

A few years after it was published, the story was translated into [[English language|English]] and [[Hebrew]] but without Kolitz's name as the author. It was passed on as an authentic testimony of the Warsaw Ghetto and ended up in several Holocaust anthologies and even as a meditation in Jewish prayer books.

It was many years before Kolitz was able to recapture his story and claim it as his own. It was later translated under his name in editions in French, Italian, German, Spanish, Danish and Swedish. In 1999, [[Pantheon Books]] published the story in a slim volume with afterwords by [[Paul Badde]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]] and [[Leon Wieseltier]]. Dr. Levinas called it ''a text both beautiful and true, true as only fiction can be.''

==Other works==
While living in Israel in the early 1950s, Kolitz was a co-writer and co-producer of ''[[Hill 24 Doesn't Answer]]'' (1954), an Israeli War of Independence movie, which was Israel's first full-length motion picture. He later moved to the United States and was co-producer of [[Rolf Hochhuth|Rolf Hochhuth's]] ''[[The Deputy]]'', one of the first plays to challenge the [[Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust|Vatican's silence during the Holocaust]], which ran on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], amid considerable controversy, for nine months in 1964.

Kolitz was co-producer of several other Broadway shows, including ''[[The Megilla of Itzik Manger]]'' (1968), and a musical, ''[[I'm Solomon]]'', an expensive flop that ran for seven performances in 1968.

Kolitz also wrote several works of fiction and Jewish philosophy, including ''The Tiger Beneath the Skin: Stories and Parables of the Years of Death'' (Creative Age Press, 1947), ''Survival for What?'' (The Philosophical Library, 1969), ''The Teacher: An Existential Approach to the Bible'' (Jason Aronson, 1982) and ''Confrontation: The Existential Thought of Rabbi J. B. Soloveitchik'' (Ktav, 1993).

Until a few weeks before his death, Kolitz wrote a weekly column for the Yiddish newspaper ''[[Algemeiner Journal]]''. The column appeared under his name for 32 years. He also taught courses in Jewish thought for many years at [[Yeshiva University]].

'''Šumadija–Vojvodina dialect''' (Serbo-Croatian: [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Latin]]: ''Šumadijsko-vojvođanski dijalekat'', [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: Шумадијско-војвођански дијалекат) is a subdialect of the [[Shtokavian dialect]] of [[Serbo-Croatian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/~rdgreenb/dialectmap.gif Map showing the distribution of the dialect]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a base for [[Ekavian]] [[Serbian language|Standard Serbian]].

==Distribution==
The dialect is mainly spoken in [[Serbia]] or more exactly in most of the province of [[Vojvodina]], as well as in [[Belgrade]], [[Mačva]], [[Šumadija]],  and [[Šumadija and Western Serbia|western Serbia]]. Some of the speakers could be also found in neighboring areas of [[Romania]], [[Croatia]] and [[Hungary]].

==History==
In the 16th century, the dialect was spoken in entire Vojvodina,&lt;ref name="scribd"&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/8366669/Наречја-и-дијалекти-српског-језика&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in some parts of present-day Hungary and Romania. During the [[Great Serb Migration]] from 1690, many speakers of the dialect were settled in the [[Budapest]] region. Most of these settlers were later assimilated.&lt;ref name="scribd"/&gt; During the 18th and 19th century, the territorial distribution of the dialect was reduced due to the migrations of speakers of [[Hungarian language]] from the north and speakers of [[Romanian language]] from the east.

==Linguistic standard==
Šumadija–Vojvodina dialect is a base for the standard [[Ekavian]] version of the [[Serbian language|Serbian literary language]].&lt;ref name="scribd"/&gt; It was also a base for the Serbian literary language in the 18th and 19th century, before the linguistic reform was introduced by [[Vuk Karadžić]].&lt;ref name="scribd"/&gt; During the reform, the standard variety of the dialect was adapted to be more similar to [[Ijekavian]] dialect.
