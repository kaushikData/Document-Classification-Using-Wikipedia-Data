{{Politics of China |expanded = Law }}

The '''''Administrative Procedure Law of the [[People's Republic of China]]''''' (APL) is legislation passed in 1990 that authorized private suits against administrative organs and personal on the grounds of infringement of their rights.  The law is often referred to in English as the '''Administrative Litigation Law''' which is a closer translation of the Chinese, but which is not the official English translation used by the PRC government.

Article 11 lists types of administrative actions that can be challenged must be "concrete actions" which include: administrative punishments (such as detentions and fines), administrative coercive measures, interference with the operations of enterprises, refusal to take action or perform an obligation, unlawful demands for performance of duties, and violations of rights of the person or a property right. The review of state action is carried out in the local people’s courts. 

Article 12 limits the scope of the law.  Court review of agency action is not permitted for state action involving national defense or foreign affairs. Moreover, the court cannot review administrative legislation.

Despite these limitations, many observers have argued that the Administrative Litigation Law has greatly furthered the spread of [[rule of law]] within the [[People's Republic of China]].  An estimated one fifth of the cases in which the law has been invoked have been decided against the government, and many legal experts have argued that the number of cases decided against the government is far higher because often the state will settle rather than losing in court.

A typical case involving the ALL involves misproporation of land.  The PRC has a very complex system of land tenure and land use rights, and often local governments will move land from agriculture to construction illegally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5623">The '''Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913''' was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that aimed to improve the protection afforded to ancient monuments in Britain.

==Details==
The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]] had begun the process of establishing legal protection for some of Britain's ancient monuments; these had all been prehistoric sites, such as ancient [[tumulus|tumuli]]. The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900]] had continued this process, empowering the government's Commissioners of Work and local County Councils to protect a wider range of properties. In 1908 a royal commission concluded that there were gaps between these two pieces of legislation, and the [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1910]]. These were felt to be unwieldy, and the Ancient Monuments Act repealed all three in 1913, replacing them with a new structure.&lt;ref&gt;Mynors, pp8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main sponsors of the bill was the former viceroy [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston]], who saved [[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire]] in 1911. Until then, owners of a building could do with it as they pleased. The experience left a deep impression on Lord Curzon, who became determined that new laws had to be put into place to protect Britain's heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Winterman, Denise. (2013-03-07) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21587468 BBC News - The man who demolished Shakespeare's house]. Bbc.co.uk. Retrieved on 2013-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new structure involved the creation of the Ancient Monuments Board to oversee the protection of such monuments. Powers were given for the Board, with Parliamentary approval, to issue preservation orders to protect monuments, and extended the public right of access to these. The term "monument" was extended to include the lands around it, allowing the protection of the wider landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Mynors, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

By 1931, over 3,000 monuments had been listed with preservation orders, and over 200 taken into public ownership. Gaps in the legislation remained, however, leading to the passing of the [[Ancient Monuments Act 1931]].&lt;ref&gt;Mynors, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both the 1913 Act and the 1931 Act were repealed in full by the [[Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/46/schedule/5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecclesiastical Exemption==

A component of the 1913 Act which remains controversial to the present day is the Ecclesiastical Exemption from listed buildings control, covering all ecclesiastical buildings in ecclesiastical use. Subsequently, the Ecclesiastical Exemption (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Order 1994 confined the Exemption to denominations deemed to have suitable internal control mechanisms in place: the Church of England, the Church in Wales, the Methodist Church, the United Reformed Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the Baptist Union of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Last, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Some heritage bodies have urged the Exemption’s abolition, arguing that it facilitates irreparable damage to historic church interiors in the name of renovation. Howell and Sutton (1989) argued on behalf of The Victorian Society:

‘The maltreatment of churches is facilitated by the existence of the so-called “Ecclesiastical Exemption” . . . It is greatly to be hoped that this anomalous situation will soon be rectified. The Victorian Society has strongly urged the total abolition of the exemption for all denominations.’&lt;ref&gt;Howell and Sutton, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of England General Synod has expressed the ecclesiastical position:

'Those who minister in churches and those who have responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of churches and their contents, should rightly be conscious of their part in ensuring that churches are indeed "living buildings".  This may often result in a desire to alter the interior of the church in some way to make it more suited to modern worship. You may also seek to add facilities, such as toilets, kitchens or meeting rooms, either within the building or by extending it.'&lt;ref&gt;

A '''balancing test''' is any judicial test in which the  [[jurists]]  weigh the importance of multiple factors in a legal case.   Proponents of such tests argue that they allow a deeper consideration of complex issues than a  [[bright line rule]]  can allow.  But critics say that such tests can be used to justify any conclusion, upon which the judge might arbitrarily decide.

In the  United States, many legal issues, which had previously been considered settled by the imposition of bright-line tests through  [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]  precedents, have been replaced by balancing tests in recent years.

==Referring to evidence==
When referring to evidence presented at a trial, the balancing test ''allows'' the court to exclude relevant evidence if its  "probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence."   In other words, if a particular piece of evidence is substantially more prejudicial than it is probative, it may not be allowed in as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rules.htm#Rule403 Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 403.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One balancing test from American [[administrative procedure law]] applies to the question of [[due process of law]], a consideration arising from the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]] to the constitution.  Due process questions concern what type of procedures are appropriate when the government takes away property or a privilege from an individual; the individual would argue that the government should have, for example, given them a hearing before taking away their driver's license or cutting off their Social Security benefits.  This balancing test, of which it weighs considerations:
# Private interest affected by an official action taken by a government agency, official or non-governmental entity (company) acting as a governmental agency.  (i.e., how important is the property or privilege that is being withheld or confiscated?)
# The risk of some deprivation being erroneously inflicted on the [[respondent]] through the process used or if no process is used.  (i.e., does giving the person a hearing or whatever else they asked for actually make it less likely that the government will make some sort of error by giving the individual an opportunity to point out the government's mistake?)
# The government’s interest in a specific outcome (for example, the government may say that giving a hearing is too expensive).

So, continuing the driver's license example, the judge would have to decide whether the person's interest in keeping their license and increased accuracy that hearings provide outweigh the government's interest in expeditiously and cheaply processing license suspensions.

Another balancing test occurs in the  [[copyright]]  domain when analyzing whether a particular usage of a copyrighted work constitutes  "[[fair use]]".   The  [[World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]]  (TRIPs)  Article 13 allows for uses "which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder."   This three-part test is also called the  [[Berne three-step test]].  The rule in the U.S. is somewhat different.  See the relevant [http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ21.pdf US Copyright Office Bulletin]).

On 22 July 1971 [[Salvador Allende]] and [[Alejandro Lanusse]], the Presidents of [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]], signed an arbitration agreement (the [http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXI/53-264.pdf '''Arbitration Agreement of 1971''']).  This agreement related to their dispute over the territorial and [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] between them, and in particular the title to the [[Beagle Channel cartography since 1881|Picton, Nueva and Lennox]] islands near the extreme end of the American continent, which was submitted to binding arbitration under the auspices of the [[United Kingdom]] government.

On 2 May 1977 the court ruled that the islands belonged to Chile (see the [http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXI/53-264.pdf '''Report and decision of the Court of Arbitration''']).
On 25 January 1978 Argentina repudiated the arbitration decision and on 22 December 1978 started (and a few hours later aborted) [[Operation Soberanía|military action]] to invade both those islands and [[continental Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;See Argentine newspaper [http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/1998/12/20/i-00401e.htm Clarín] of Buenos Aires, 20 December 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AlgunasIslasAlSurDelCanalBeagle.png|thumb|right|300px|The ''Hammer'' ABCDEF. 1978 Argentina claimed also territories east of the [[Cape Horn]].]]

== The Court ==
The [[British Crown]] had previously in 1902 and 1966 acted as [[arbitrator]] between Chile and Argentina (see Arbitration 1902 [http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_IX/37-49.pdf here]), but, given the growing [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute]] between Argentina and the United Kingdom, the parties agreed to change the statutory framework of the Arbitration.

The Arbitration Agreement of 1971 stipulated:
* the names of the 5 judges appointed (see the preamble of the Arbitration Agreement):
** [[Hardy Cross Dillard]] ([[United States of America]])
** [[Gerald Fitzmaurice]] ([[United Kingdom]])
** André Gros ([[France]])
** Charles D. Onyeama ([[Nigeria]])
** Sture Petrén ([[Sweden]])
* the region where the court was to define the borderline (A polygon ABCDEF, known as "Hammer", see paragraph 4 of Article 1 of the Arbitration Agreement)
* that the final decision would be submitted to the British Crown, which was then to recommend acceptance or rejection of the award of the court but not to modify it (Article XIII of the Arbitration Agreement)
* that the Court of Arbitration should reach its conclusions in accordance with the principles of international law.
* that each of the Parties should defray its own expenses and one half of the expenses of the Court of Arbitration and of Her Britannic Majesty's Government in relation to the Arbitration.

In this way the [[United Kingdom]] did not have any influence on the judgement: the procedure, the legal framework, the judges and the matter in dispute had all been defined by both countries.

== Procedure ==

The procedure had four phases:

# The ''Memorials'' (starting from 1 January 1973) in terms of the delivery of written pleadings, annexes and maps.
# The ''Counter-Memorials'' (starting from 2 June 1974) in terms of the responses.
# The ''Replies'' (starting from 1 June 1975) in terms of comments.
# The ''Oral proceedings'' (starting from 7 November 1975 to 23. October 1976) in terms of oral statements that were made in English or French at the speaker's choice, a simultaneous translation into English being provided in the latter case.

Chile handed over to the Court 14 volumes and 213 maps, and Argentina 12 volumes and 195 maps.

During the first fortnight of March 1976, the Court, accompanied by the Registrar and Liaison Officers from both sides, visited the Beagle Channel region, and inspected the islands and waterways concerned, first on the Chilean Naval Transport Vessel ''"Aquiles"'', and then on the Argentine Naval Transport Vessel ''"ARA Bahia Aguirre"''.

== Arguments ==

In the '''border treaty of 1855''' Chile and Argentina had agreed to retain the borders of the Spanish colonial administration. This principle, known in jurisprudence as ''[[Uti possidetis]]'', served two purposes: the first was to divide the territory between the two countries, and the second to preclude the creation of ''[[Res nullius]]'' areas that could have been taken in possession by other powers (such as the [[United States of America]], the [[UK]] or [[France]] – although the [[Beagle Channel]] had been unknown until 1830 and there had been no Spanish settlements south of [[Chiloé]]).

The [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina|boundary treaty of 1881]] described, without any map, the course of the 5600&lt;ref&gt;See Libro de Defensa de Chile [http://www.defensenet.ser2000.org/Archivo/libro-chile/defc-pII.htm#cIIIa1 Continuidad: historia y geografía] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726001145/http://www.defensenet.ser2000.org/Archivo/libro-chile/defc-pII.htm#cIIIa1 |date=2009-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; km border as follows:
* over the [[Andes]] mountains (from north to parallel 52°S: 'the highest peaks that divide the waters') (Article I),
* in the region north of and through the [[Strait of Magellan]] (mainly along the 52°S [[Parallel (latitude)|parallel]]) (Article II) and
* in the [[Tierra del Fuego]]-Beagle Channel region (Article III).

The controversial articles II and III of the 1881 treaty were:

[[File:Beagle.1984.en.png|thumb|200px|right|Present frontier. There was until 1881 mutual agreement about the border line from the 52°S parallel to the north shore of the Beagle Channel. From the Beagle Channel to Cape Horn it was determined by the Award of 1977 and the Treaty of 1984]]

:Article II)
:''"In the southern part of the continent, and to the north of the [[Straits of Magellan]], the boundary between the two countries shall be a line, which starting from Point Dungeness, shall be prolonged overland as far as Mount Dinero; thence it shall continue westward, following the highest elevations of the chain of hills existing there, until it strikes the height of Mount Aymont. From this point the line shall be prolonged up to the intersection of meridian 70° W., with parallel 52° S. and thence it shall continue westward coinciding with this latter parallel as far as the ''divortium aquarum'' of the Andes. The territories lying to the north of said line shall belong to the Argentine Republic, and to Chili those that extend to the south, without prejudice to the provisions of Art. 3d concerning Tierra del Fuego and the adjacent islands"''.

:Article III)
:''"In Tierra del Fuego a line shall be drawn, which starting from the point called Cape Espiritu Santo in parallel 52°40, shall be prolonged to the south along the meridian 68°34 west of Greenwich until it touches Beagle Channel. Tierra del Fuego, divided in this manner, shall be Chilean on the western side and Argentine on the eastern. As for the islands, to the Argentine Republic shall belong Staten Island, the small islands next to it, and the other islands there may be on the Atlantic to the east of Tierra del Fuego and of the eastern coast of Patagonia; and to Chile shall belong all the islands to the south of Beagle Channel up to Cape Horn, and those there may be to the west of Tierra del Fuego"''.

Under the so-called '''oceanic principle''' Argentina believed that the ''uti possidetis'' doctrine operated such that, under the arrangements operated by the colonial administrations, Chile (then the [[Captaincy General of Chile]]) had no territorial waters in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the Argentine (then the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]]) could not have territorial waters in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The Argentine saw a reaffirmation of this principle in the [[Pactos de Mayo|Protocols of 1902]], according to Rizzo Romano the first arms control pact in the world,&lt;ref&gt;See Rizzo Romano, cited in "Canal de Beagle: El Laudo arbitral de la corona británica" by José Enrique Greño Velasco in [http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2496654 Universidad de La Rioja] (p. 70)
:''La Convención sobre limitación de armamentos comprende cinco artículos, y tiene el privilegio de ser – de acuerdo a Rizzo Romano — el primer convenio en su tipo ajustado entre naciones.''&lt;/ref&gt; under which both countries agreed that the Chilean navy should have enough ships to defend the interests of Chile in the Pacific, and the Argentine navy should have enough ships to defend the interests of Argentina in the Atlantic. Chile doesn't consider the 1902 protocol as a border treaty and the word ''Pacific'' doesn't appear in the Boundary treaty, and hence claimed that the boundary between the Pacific and the Atlantic had never been defined.&lt;ref&gt;See interview with Julio Philippi Izquierdo in the Chilean newspaper [[El Mercurio]] on 10 January 1978, cited in [https://books.google.com/books?id=XDXdhs_Kg1UC ''Argentina y el Laudo Arbitral del Canal Beagle''], by German Carrasco, Editorial Jurídica de Chile, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kanalarme.es.png|thumb|right|200px|Two views over the Beagle Channel as seen by the signatories of the Treaty of 1881. Above the Chilean view, below the Argentine view]]
To resolve the conflicting interests of both countries, they decided in 1881 on an agreement; but nearly a century later there was still no mutual understanding of what that agreement had consisted of. Chile maintained it had only renounced rights to eastern Patagonia (today continental south Argentina) to obtain full possession of the Strait of Magellan, but Argentina believed Chile received the Strait of Magellan in return for renouncing all coasts bordering the Atlantic Ocean.

About the course of the Beagle Channel there were discrepancies. The eastern end of the Channel can be seen as a [[River delta|delta]] with an east-west [[Arm (geography)|arm]] and a north-south arm (around [[Navarino Island]]). The channel specified in the border treaty of 1881 was seen by Chile as the east-west arm, but by Argentina as the north-south arm.  Following this controversy, two clauses were in dispute: Chile argued the '''Channel clause''' (''... to Chile shall belong all the islands to the south of Beagle Channel up to Cape Horn,...''), while Argentina the '''Atlantic clause''' (''... the other islands there may be on the Atlantic to the east of Tierra del Fuego ...'').  Some Chileans argued that the text ''"until it touches the Beagle Channel"'' in article III meant that Argentina had no navigable waters in the Beagle Channel, although this interpretation was not supported by the Chilean claim.

== The judgement ==

[[File:Arbitralaward1977.png|thumb|200px|right|Borderline (red line) through the Beagle Channel according to the arbitral award]]

A unanimous judgement was handed over to Queen Elizabeth II on 18 April 1977. The French judge André Gros gave a dissenting vote, not concerning the result but the reason. On 2 May 1977 the judgement was announced to the governments of both countries.

It involved the border running approximately along the center of the Channel, and awarded both Chile and Argentina sovereignty over [[navigable]] waters in the Channel:

:''"the Court considers it as amounting to an overriding general principle of law that, in absence of express provision to the contrary, an attribution of territory must ''ipso facto'' carry with it the waters appurtenant to the territory attributed" (§107 Report and Decision of the Court of Arbitration).''

Whaits island, the [[islet]]s called Snipe, Eugenia, Solitario, Hermanos, Gardiner and Reparo, and the [[Bank (topography)|bank]] known as Herradura were awarded to Chile.  All of these lie near the southern bank of the Beagle Channel.

Argentina was awarded all islands, islets and rocks near the north coast of the channel: Bridges, Eclaireurs, [[Gable Island|Gable]], Becasses, Martillo and Yunque.

At the eastern end of the Channel, the judgement recognized the sovereignty of Chile over the  Picton, Nueva and Lennox islands and all their adjacent islets and rocks.

The territorial waters established by these coasts, according to international maritime law, established Chilean rights in the Atlantic Ocean.

The Court sentenced also:&lt;ref&gt;See Michel Morris, "The Straits of Magellan", Nijhoff Publishers, 1989, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;
# the 1881 treaty had given Chile exclusive control of the strait (§ 31)
# the waters of the strait were likewise Chilean since Chile controls both shores (§37)
# the Chilean Point Dungenes is on the Atlantic (§24)
# the 1893 Protocol had not altered the basic nature of the 1881 treaty compromise (§74)

== The reasons of the Court ==

The court rejected both the uti possidetis principle and the oceanic principle because:
:''«...In the particular case of the 1881 Treaty no useful purpose would be served by attempting to resolve doubts or conflicts regarding the Treaty, merely by referring to the very same principle or doctrine, the uncertain effect of which in the territorial relations between the Parties, had itself caused the Treaty to be entered into, as constituting the only (and intendedly final) means of resolving this uncertainty. To proceed in such a manner would merely be to enter a circulus inextricabilis....»''&lt;ref&gt;See §21 and §22 of the [http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXI/53-264.pdf '''Report and decision of the Court of Arbitration''']&lt;/ref&gt;

The tribunal considered that the exchange of Patagonia for the Strait of Magellan was the transaction behind the 1881 treaty:
:''«...This [Patagonia] was what Chile conceded by giving up a claim that still had enough vitality and content, at least politically, to make its final abandonment of primary importance to Argentina. It is on this basis, as well as on the actual attribution of Patagonian territory to Argentina effected by Article II of the Treaty, that the Court reaches the conclusion that it was the antithesis Patagonia/Magellan, rather than Magellan/Atlantic, which constituted the fundamental element of the Treaty settlement....»''&lt;ref&gt;See §31 of the [http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXI/53-264.pdf '''Report and decision of the Court of Arbitration''']&lt;/ref&gt;

After careful consideration of all possible word meanings and interpretations of the text, the court refused the Atlantic clause:
:''«...The Argentine interpretation depends on subjecting the text to a process, not exactly of amendment, but of what is known as emendation, i.e. adjustment to accommodate a different outlook. This is in no way an illegitimate proceeding as such, —but its acceptability in any given case must depend on how compelling are the reasons that operate to support it, and also on the degree of adjustment entailed. The following are the adaptations that would be required:...»''&lt;ref&gt;See §65 of the [http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXI/53-264.pdf '''Report and decision of the Court of Arbitration''']&lt;/ref&gt;

== The reaction to the judgement ==

[[File:Baselines chile.png|thumb|right|200px|Baselines of Chile on the map]]

Chile accepted the judgement immediately and enacted it into its domestic law on 14 June 1977 ([https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/CHL_1977_416.pdf decree n°416] over the [[Territorial waters#Baseline|base lines]]).

On 25 January 1978 Argentina repudiated the arbitration award. According to Argentina:&lt;ref&gt;A refutation in detail of the Argentine Thesis can be seen in [http://www.zaoerv.de/39_1979/39_1979_2_b_341_354.pdf Der Schiedsspruch in der Beagle-Kanal-Streitigkeit], Karin Oellers-Frahm, Max-Planck-Institut für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht) in German Language&lt;/ref&gt;
# the Argentine argument had been distorted and misrepresented.
# the judgement had covered topics outside its terms of reference
# the Court had drawn contradictory conclusions.
# the Court had made errors of interpretation.
# the Court had made geographical and historical errors.
# the Court had not properly balanced the arguments and evidence of each party.

It has been argued that the Argentine claims over the Beagle Channel could not be sustained from a legal point of view and that in practice many of their assertions were subjective.&lt;ref name="Eyal.Benvenisti.Moshe.Hirsch"&gt;See [http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521835542 The Impact of International Law on International Cooperation] of Eyal Benvenisti and Moshe Hirsch, Cambridge University Press, 2004, 316 pp.,{{ISBN|0-521-83554-2}} chapter "Compliance and non-compliance with international norms in territorial disputes: The Latin-American record of arbitrations" of Arie M.

== Aftermath ==

The court awarded navigable waters on the north bank of the eastern part of the Channel to Argentina, but otherwise it met all Chilean claims. Although the arbitration concerned only small islands, the direction of the new demarcation of the frontier would under international maritime law give Chile significant rights running into the Atlantic Ocean, and would also significantly reduce the claims of Argentina on the Antarctic continent and its waters.

The Argentine rejection led both countries to the verge of war. On 22 December 1978 Argentina started [[Operation Soberanía|military action]] to invade the islands. Only last minute papal mediation prevented the outbreak of armed conflict. The award was a defeat for Argentine foreign policy, and initiated an uncoupling from the international community, which lead Argentina three years later into the [[Falklands war]].

The arbitration was completely separate from the Falkland Islands issue, a fact that is often obfuscated or publicly denied in Argentina, where the arbitration is often presented as a plot by the UK.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the book "Argentina en el Atlántico, Chile en el Pacífico" of [[Isaac Rojas|Isaac Francisco Rojas]] p. 45:
:''S.M. Isabel II nombró un consejo para que la asesorase''
:(Translation:"Queen Elizabeth II appointed a council for her advice").
The "council", actually the international tribunal, was named in the Arbitration Agreement of 1971 jointly by Chile and Argentina. The book is approved for teaching by the Argentine Ministry of Education in middle schools and universities (circular nr. 191/78 und Disposición nr. 961/78 de S.N.E.P)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Argentine Newspaper [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] 2. February 2005 [http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/05/02/elpais/p-01201.htm]:
:''«...el laudo del 18 de abril de 1977 de un tribunal, que, en 1971, la dictadura de Alejandro A. Lanusse había aceptado que estuviera bajo el influjo de la corona británica...»''
:(Translation:''«...the award of 1977 of ... a tribunal under the influence of the british crown ...»'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See "the most consequent defender of the rejection" Argentine's Profesor Rizzo Romano, cited in "Canal de Beagle: El Laudo arbitral de la corona británica" by José Enrique Greño Velasco in [http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2496654 Universidad de La Rioja] (p. 83),
: ''3) Pretender que una nación [United Kingdom] cuyo Gobierno ocupa y coloniza ilegalmente parte de un distrito [Falklands] administrativo de otro Estado [Argentina] pueda determinar válidamente si otra porción del mismo distrito [Beagle Channel] le corresponde a éste o a un tercer Estado [Chile] que se encuentra en similar situación ilegal resulta absurdo y aberrante, constituyendo un motivo principal para que nuestro Parlamento no confirme dicho tratado.''
: ''4) En caso de aprobarse el Acuerdo Arbitral de 1971, nuestra Nación estaría indirectamente aprobando la invariable posición británica que niega la existencia de una disputa de soberanía sobre Las Malvinas y sus adyacencias con la República Argentina.''
:(Translation:''«... ...»'')&lt;/ref&gt;

Pablo Lacoste in his work ''"La disputa por el Beagle y el papel de los actores no estatales argentinos"'' (Argentine Civil Society Agencies in the Beagle Dispute) says:
: ''The Argentine newspaper [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarin]] wished to show that the UK government had taken a substantive role in the arbitration, so that it could be criticized as biased in this by its own dispute with Argentina over the Falklands. To buttress this suggestion, on 3 May 1977, just as the arbitration award was announced, the newspaper put on its front page a cartoon of Queen Elizabeth II eating a [[Phrygian cap|Cap of Liberty]], an Argentine emblem. Note that the same monarch had resolved the Palena and California controversies [i.e. other border disputes between Chile and Argentina] ten years previously, and that the Argentine government had accepted those decisions – but that in 1977 the Argentine press did not mention these precedents.''&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-23762004000100005 "La disputa por el Beagle y el papel de los actores no estatales argentinos"] in [[Revista Universum]] Nº 19 Vol. 1 :86–109, 2004, also [http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-23762004000100005 here] retrieved 17.April.2009:
: ''«Algo que le interesaba al Clarín, era mostrar un papel protagónico de los ingleses en este proceso, asunto que se podía criticar por el pleito pendiente entre Argentina y Gran Bretaña por las Malvinas. Para fortalecer este concepto, en la primera plana del 3 de mayo de 1977, se incluía una caricatura de la reina Isabel II comiéndose un gorro frigio, parte del escudo nacional argentino. Recordemos que se trata de la misma soberana que había emitido el laudo de Palena y California una década antes, el cual había sido aceptado por el gobierno argentino y con el cual se había solucionado otro problema de límites con Chile. Naturalmente, en 1977, la prensa argentina no hizo la menor mención de ese antecedente.»''&lt;/ref&gt;

The award brought the military dictatorships on both sides to the border to a unique and paradoxical situation: in Chile they celebrated the "wise" decision of the (overthrown) enemy Allende, and in Argentina they criticized the "imprudent" decision of his former colleague in power, general Lanusse.

The award was later fully recognized by Argentina in the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina|Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1984]].&lt;ref&gt;The Treaty of 1984 does not address the sovereignty of the Picton, Nueva, Lennox, etc. islands.  Instead of this, it reaffirms the terms of the border treaty of 1881 and '' ... sus instrumentos complementarios y declaratorios... '' (Translation: "... its complementary declaratory instruments...") and in article VII it defines the maritime border '' ... A partir del término de la delimitación existente en el Canal Beagle, esto es, el punto fijado por las coordenadas 55°07.3 de latitud Sur y 66°25.0 de longitud Oeste,... '' , (translation: ... starting from the end of the existing boundary in the Beagle channel, that is, the point of intersection of latitude 55°.07.3 S and longitude 66°.25.0 W ...), that is, the point at the eastern end of the Beagle channel). The islands remained under Chilean sovereignty, but the maritime border was moved to the west.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5397">The '''business mileage reimbursement rate''' is an optional standard mileage rate used in the [[United States]] for purposes of computing the allowable business deduction, for [[Income tax in the United States|Federal income tax purposes]] under the [[Internal Revenue Code]], at {{usc|26|162}}, for the business use of a vehicle. Under the law, the taxpayer for each year is generally entitled to deduct either the actual expense amount, or an amount computed using the standard mileage rate, whichever is greater.

The business mileage reimbursement rate is also used by some employers for computing employee reimbursement amounts when an employee operates a motor vehicle not owned by the employer for the employer's business purposes. The [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) sets the rate for federal jobs. In general, the GSA rate matches the annual rate set by the IRS, although by law the government employee reimbursement rate cannot exceed the mileage rate set by the IRS for business deductions.&lt;ref&gt;''Travel and Subsistence Expenses; Mileage Allowances'', 5 U.S.C. 5704(a)(1), Available from: [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/uscode/index.html US Code Main Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130171856/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/uscode/index.html |date=January 30, 2009 }}, Government Printing Office; Accessed January 28, 2009. "In any year in which the Internal Revenue Service establishes a single standard mileage rate for optional use by taxpayers in computing the deductible costs of operating their automobiles for business purposes, the rate per mile established by the Administrator (of the GSA) shall not exceed the single standard mileage rate established by the Internal Revenue Service."&lt;/ref&gt;

Reimbursement by an employer on a per-mile basis is also used in other countries; it offers a similar simplification to payment of subsistence [[per diem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2610">The '''Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982''' (c.27) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], which was passed to implement the [[Brussels Regime|Brussels Convention]] of 1968 into British law. As well as governing whether the Courts of [[England and Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] have jurisdiction to hear cases against defendants in other contracting states, the Act provided a statutory basis for the division of jurisdiction between the three jurisdictions within the UK. No provision was made in 1982 for division of jurisdiction between the UK and [[Gibraltar]]; this was rectified by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 (Gibraltar) Order 1997 which stated that, for the purposes of the 1982 Act, Gibraltar should be treated as a separate contracting state.

A further significant amendment was made to the Act by the [[Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1991]] which gave Courts power under the [[Brussels Regime|Lugano convention]], and later by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Order 2001 which gave Courts jurisdiction under Council Regulation (EC) 44/2001 (commonly known as the Judgments Regulation or the Brussels Regulation). The latter applies to all 27 current member states of the [[European Union]].

==Contracting states in 1982==
The contracting states to the [[Brussels Regime|Brussels Convention]] in 1982 were the then members of the [[European Economic Community]] (now the [[European Union]]). These were [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], (West) [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]].

The '''Cobras''' ({{lang-sr|Kobre/Кобрe}}) is a [[military police]] unit of the [[Serbian Armed Forces]], responsible for [[counter-terrorism]], [[close protection]] and [[special operations]]. The unit consists of one battalion and 200 members (as of 2013) and is notably responsible for protection of military officials and the [[President of Serbia|President]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.special-ops.org/military-police-battalion-of-the-army-of-serbia-cobra/ Military Police Battalion of the Army of Serbia – Cobra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322135634/http://www.special-ops.org/military-police-battalion-of-the-army-of-serbia-cobra/ |date=2015-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of several [[special forces of Serbia]], and the oldest anti-terrorist unit in former Yugoslavia.

The unit was first established by the order of the Secretary of Defense on 14 April 1978. The unit was included in a special 'anti-terrorist department' ({{lang|sr|Odeljenje Vojne policije za protivteroristička dejstva}}) within the 282nd battalion of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA). In 1985 the department expanded and transformed into a 'anti-terrorist platoon' ({{lang|sr|Vod za protivteroristička dejstva}}) which led the Guard Brigades. It continued to exist after the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] as a special unit of the [[Armed Forces of Serbia and Montenegro|FR Yugoslav/Serbia and Montenegro Armed Forces]] (1992–2006). It was active in the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. In 1992 it was transferred to the Special Units Corps ({{lang|sr|Korpus specijalnih jedinica}}), which included the [[63rd Parachute Battalion]], [[72nd Reconnaissance-Commando Battalion|72nd Assault Battalion]] and 1st Guard Brigade. In 2000 the unit was placed under the direct command of the Chief of General Staff. The unit further expanded, much thanks to colonel ({{lang|sr|pukovnik}}) Stojan Kljajić who commanded the unit until 2005. In this period the symbol of a winged cobra twisted around a sword was adopted. It was organized as an anti-terrorist detachment until 2006, when it became the present-day battalion, since a component of the Serbian military police.

A '''congress''' is a formal meeting of the representatives of different [[country|nation]]s, [[constituent state]]s, organizations [[trade unions]], and [[Political party|political parties]]), or groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/congress |title=congress |work=Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English Online |publisher=[[Longman]] |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term, originally denoting a [[parley]] during battle in the [[Late Middle Ages]], is derived from the [[Latin]] ''congressus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=congress| url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/congress| work=Oxford English Dictionry Online| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| location=Oxford, England, UK| accessdate=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Wiktionary-inline|congressus}})

In the mid-1770s, the term was chosen by the [[Thirteen Colonies|13 British colonies]] for the [[Continental Congress]] to emphasize the status of each colony represented there as a [[State (polity)|self-governing entity]]. Subsequent to the use of ''congress'' as the name for the [[United States Congress|legislature of the U.S. federal government]] (beginning in 1789), the term has been adopted by many [[Sovereign state|nations]] to refer to their national [[legislature]]s.

In [[criminal law]], '''consent''' may be used as an [[excuse]] and prevent the defendant from incurring [[legal liability|liability]] for what was done.&lt;ref&gt;For a more general discussion, see Dennis J. Baker, "The Moral Limits of Consent as a Defense in the Criminal Law," 12(1) ''New Criminal Law Review'' (2009); Dennis J. Baker, [http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781409427650 ''The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority''] (Ashgate, 2011); see also [[consensual crime]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generally==
A defence against criminal liability may arise when a defendant can argue that, because of consent, there was no crime (e.g., arguing that permission was given to use an automobile, so it was not [[theft]] or [[TWOC|taken without owner's consent]]).  But [[public policy (law)|public policy]] requires [[court]]s to lay down limits on the extent to which [[citizen]]s are allowed to consent or are to be bound by apparent consent given.
* As an application of ''[[parens patriae]]'', for example, [[minor (law)|minors]] cannot consent to having [[sexual intercourse]] under a specified age even though the particular instance of [[statutory rape]] might be a "victimless" offense. In the case of [[adult]]s, there are similar limits imposed on their [[capacity (law)|capacity]] where the [[State (polity)|state]] deems the issue to be of sufficient significance. Thus, for example, an individual [[domicile (law)|domiciled]] in a [[common law]] state cannot give consent and create a valid second [[marriage (conflict)|marriage]]. The second ceremony will do no more than expose the prospective spouse to a charge of [[bigamy]]. Similarly, no consent can be given for an [[incest]]uous relationship nor for relationships that expose one of the parties to excessive [[violence]] (e.g. most states have a rule that an abusive [[Marriage|husband]] can be prosecuted even if the [[wife]] does not co-operate and give evidence to rebut the husband's defense that the wife consented). In English law, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 removes the element of consent from the ''[[actus reus]]'' of many offences, so that only the act itself and the age or other constraints need to be proved, including:
{{Quote|children under 16 years generally, and under 18 years if having sexual relations with persons in a position of trust or with family members over 18 years; and persons with a mental disorder that impedes choice who are induced, threatened, or deceived, or who have sexual relations with care workers.}}
* Most states have laws which criminalize [[misrepresentation]]s, [[deception]]s, and [[fraud]].  These are situations in which a victim may have given apparent consent to parting with ownership or possession of money and/or goods, or to generally suffering a loss, but this consent is treated as vitiated by the dishonesty of the person making the untrue representations.  Thus, while the criminal law is not generally a means of escaping civil obligations, the criminal courts may be able to offer some assistance to the gullible by returning their property or making compensation orders.

==Consensual activity==
The problem has always been to decide at what level the victim's consent becomes ineffective.  Historically in the UK, the defense was denied when the injuries caused amounted to a ''maim'' (per [[Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown]] (8th ed.) 1824).  In ''R v Donovan'' (1934) AER 207 in which Swift J. stated the general rule that:
{{Quote|No person can license another to commit a crime, if (the jury) were satisfied that the blows struck ... were likely or intended to do bodily harm ... they ought to convict ... only if they were not so satisfied (was it) necessary to consider the further question whether the prosecution had negatived consent.}}
However, consent is valid in a range of circumstances, including [[contact sports]] (such as [[boxing]] or [[mixed martial arts]]), as well as [[body modification]]s.  But in the context of sadomasochism, Lord Mustill in ''[[R v Brown]]'' (1993)&lt;ref&gt;2 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]], page 103&lt;/ref&gt; has set the level just below [[actual bodily harm]].  ''R v Wilson'' (1996), which involved a case where a husband branded his wife's buttocks, upheld that consent can be a valid defence. The act was considered comparable to tattooing, whilst ''Brown'' applied specifically to [[sadomasochism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lawteacher.net/Consent_Wilson.htm |title=Law Teacher.net - Free Case Law Database, Essay Marking and Custom Essay Writing&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt; |access-date=27 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131222607/http://www.lawteacher.net/Consent_Wilson.htm |archive-date=31 January 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of consent in the course of sado-masochistic sexual activity was considered in ''R v Stein'' (2007), a case in which a participant died as a result of being gagged. The court held that, even if the victim had consented to a being restrained and gagged, his consent was invalid because there was no way for him to communicate its withdrawal once the gag was in his mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSCA|300|2007|litigants=R v Stein |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For sado-masochism, ''R v Boyea'' (1992) 156 JPR 505 was another application of the ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' in ''Donovan'' that even if she had actually consented to injury by allowing the defendant to [[Fisting|put his hand into her vagina]] and twist it, causing internal and external injuries to her vagina and bruising on her pubis, the woman's consent (if any) would have been irrelevant.  The court took [[judicial notice]] of the change in social attitudes to sexual matters, but "the extent of the violence inflicted… went far beyond the risk of minor injury to which, if she did consent, her consent would have been a defence".  In ''R v Brown'', the [[House of Lords]] rejected the defense on public policy grounds (see below).  This is an application of the general rule that, once an ''actus reus'' with an appropriate ''[[mens rea]]'' has been established, no defense can be admitted, but the [[evidence (law)|evidence]] may be admitted to mitigate the [[sentence (law)|sentence]].  This decision was confirmed in the [[ECHR]] in ''Laskey v United Kingdom'' (1997) 24 EHRR 39 on the basis that although the prosecution might have constituted an interference with the private lives of those involved, it was justified for the protection of public health.  In ''R v Emmett'' (unreported, 18 June 1999), as part of their consensual sexual activity, the woman allowed her partner to cover her head with a plastic bag, tying it tightly at the neck.  On a different occasion, she agreed that he could pour fuel from a lighter onto her breasts and set fire to the fuel.  On the first occasion, she was at risk of death, and lost consciousness.  On the second, she suffered burns, which became infected.  The court applied ''Brown'' and ruled that the woman's consent to these events did not provide a defence for her partner.  The general rule, therefore, is that violence involving the deliberate and intentional infliction of bodily harm is and remains unlawful notwithstanding that its purpose is the sexual gratification of one or both participants.  Notwithstanding their sexual overtones, these cases are considered to be violent crimes and it is not an [[excuse]] that one partner consents.

''[[Maouloud Baby v. State of Maryland]]'' was a 2007 case in the [[Maryland Court of Appeals]], the state's highest court, which determined that a person may withdraw sexual consent after having given it, and that the continuation of sexual activity after the withdrawal of consent constitutes rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/16/AR2008041602921.html |title=Md.

[[Alzheimer's disease]] or similar disabilities may result in a person being unable to give legal consent to sexual relations even with their spouse.&lt;ref name=NYT42215&gt;{{cite news|author1=Pam Belluck|title=Iowa Man Found Not Guilty of Sexually Abusing Wife With Alzheimer's|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/health/iowa-man-found-not-guilty-of-sexually-abusing-wife-with-alzheimers.html|accessdate=April 23, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ability to consent==
In Australia, If a sexual partner was asleep, unconscious or a jury decides that a complainant was unable to consent, sexual contact is considered rape. In New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, consent is not possible when the complainant was asleep or unconscious. In Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, there is no consent where the complainant is so affected by alcohol or other drugs as "to be incapable of freely agreeing" to the sexual activity. In the Australian Capital Territory, the effect of alcohol or other drugs is less qualified; there is no consent if it is caused by "the effect of intoxicating liquor, a drug or anaesthetic". In NSW, there may be no consent where a complainant was "substantially intoxicated by alcohol or any drug". This formulation adopts the view expressed in the report of the Criminal Justice Sexual Offences Taskforce and&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/25. Sexual Offences/consent&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Law Reform Commission that the degree of intoxication and whether it was such that a person was "unable to consent" are matters for the jury.

==Consent obtained by deception==
In ''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23, at a time when the defendant knew that he was suffering from a venereal disease, he had sexual intercourse and communicated the disease to his wife.

Had she been aware, she would not have submitted to the intercourse. The defendant was convicted  of inflicting [[grievous bodily harm]] contrary  to section 20 of  the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]. On appeal the conviction was quashed. Mr Justice Willis said:

{{Quote|...that consent obtained by fraud is no consent at all is not true as a general proposition either in fact or in law.}}

Mr Justice Stephens had said (at p.&amp;nbsp;44):

{{Quote|...the only sorts of fraud which so far destroy the effect of a woman's consent as to convert a connection consented to in fact into a rape are frauds as to the nature of the act itself, or as to the identity of the person who does the act. Consent in such cases does not exist at all because the act consented to is not the act done.}}

Until recently, the case has never been challenged, but its current status was complicated by the then general assumptions that "infliction" required some act of violence, and that non-physical injuries could not be inflicted and so were outside the scope of the Offences Against the Person Act.

Now the ruling in ''R v Chan-Fook'' [1994] 1 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 689, which held that psychiatric injury could be [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]], has been confirmed by the [[House of Lords]] in ''R v Burstow'', ''R v Ireland'' [1998] 1 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 177. These cases overrule the implicit [[ratio decidendi]] of ''Clarence'' that non-physical injuries can be injuries within the scope of the Offences Against the Person Act and without the need to prove a physical application of violence, Lord Steyn describing ''Clarence'' as a "troublesome authority", and, in the specific context of the meaning of "inflict" in section 20, said expressly that Clarence "no longer assists".

This left the issue of fraud. In ''[[R v Linekar]]'' [1995] QB 250, a prostitute stated the fact that she would not have consented to sexual intercourse if she had known that her client was not intending to pay, but there was no fraud-induced consent as to the nature of the activity, nor was the identity of the client relevant. In ''R v Richardson'' [1998] 2 Cr App R 200, the patient believed that she was receiving dental treatment which otherwise would have given rise to an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, from a dentist who had in fact been struck off the register. The Court held that the identity of the defendant was not a feature which, in that case, precluded the giving of consent by the patient. In ''R v Navid Tabassum'' (May, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non%20Fatal%20Assaults/Consent%20Tabassum.htm |title=Consent Tabassum (2000) |date=2003-12-19 |access-date=2016-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031219124836/http://www.lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non%20Fatal%20Assaults/Consent%20Tabassum.htm |archivedate=19 December 2003 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the three complainant women agreed to the appellant showing them how to examine their own breasts. That involved the appellant, himself, feeling the breasts of two of the women and using a stethoscope beneath the bra of the third woman. Each of the three women said that they had only consented because they thought the appellant had either medical qualifications or relevant training. He had neither. There was no evidence of any sexual motive. He was convicted on the basis that the complainants had only consented to acts medical in nature and not to indecent behaviour, that is, there was consent to the nature of the act but not its quality. In ''R v Cort'' [2003] 3 WLR 1300, a case of kidnapping, the complainants had consented to taking a ride in a car, but not to being kidnapped. They wanted transport, not kidnapping. Kidnapping may be established by carrying away by fraud.
"It is difficult to see how one could ever consent to that once fraud was indeed established. The 'nature' of the act here is therefore taking the complainant away by fraud. The complainant did not consent to that event. All that she consented to was a ride in the car, which in itself is irrelevant to the offence and a different thing from that with which Mr Cort is charged".

A paper on website ''The Student Lawyer'' examined the basis for fraud as grounds for negating consent, in the context of the decision not to charge officers involved in the [[UK undercover policing relationships scandal]]. It concluded that the issues which might arise if this was a legal basis to negate consent, could be far wider than might be first appreciated. Examples given by the author included:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thestudentlawyer.com/2013/10/09/sex-lies-and-undercover-cops/|title=Sex, Lies and Undercover Cops|last=|first=|date=2013-10-09|website=The Student Lawyer|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|Andrew is secretly having an affair but denies this to his wife; they later have sex; Barney exaggerates his financial success and pretends to like the same music and films as his date in order to impress her; they later have sex; Charlie dyes his hair and pretends to be in his mid-30s on a dating website when he is really in his 50s; he later has sex with someone he meets online; Derek is unhappy in his marriage and is considering whether to leave his wife; he does not mention his misgivings before they have sex. In each case, their sexual partners would not have consented had they known the truth and a reasonable person might be expected to realise this.}}

===Sexual transmission of disease===
In 1998, the Home Office issued a consultation paper entitled ''Violence: Reforming the Offences Against the Person Act 1861'' rejecting the Law Commission's recommendation that there should be offences for the intentional or reckless transmission of disease. The Government "[was] particularly concerned that the law should not seem to discriminate against those who are HIV positive, have AIDS or viral Hepatitis or who carry any kind of disease".

It did, however, accept that society should have criminal sanctions for use against "evil acts", and that this might include people who transmitted diseases causing serious illness to others with intent to do them such harm, adding that "this aims to strike a sensible balance between allowing very serious intentional acts to be punished while not rendering individuals liable for prosecution of unintentional or reckless acts or for the transmission of minor disease" (see paras 3.13-318)

In 2000, the government repeated that view in a consultation relating to the law on [[Manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]], "The Government remains wholly committed to this approach."

This has since been considered in [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2004/1103.html ''R. v Dica,''] which deals with the [[criminal transmission of HIV|transmission of HIV]], holding that it was not necessary to prove that the transmission had involved an assault for the "inflicting" of the disease.

The judgment rejects the rule in ''Clarence'' as tainted by the then presumption of a wife's marital consent to sexual intercourse, although ''Clarence'' was still being applied after the criminalisation of rape within marriage. The more modern authorities involving the transmission of psychological conditions and in other sexual matters, reject the notion that consent can be a defence to anything more than a trivial injury.

Yet this is not without its difficulties. If it is proposed to criminalise the consensual taking of risks of infection by having unprotected sexual intercourse, enforcement is impractical. The community prefers that sexual relationships are a private matter between the individuals involved and if adults were suddenly to be liable to prosecution for taking known risks with their health, this would represent a significant interference with personal autonomy. Further, the law cannot expect people suddenly to become honest with each other and to counsel the use of condoms, and there may be negative consequences if HIV was to be disclosable, because those who ought to take medical advice and undergo tests, might be discouraged from doing so.

Consequently, the Appeal Court decided that had the women known of his infection, their consent to unprotected sexual intercourse would have been a valid defence. In this regard, they overturned the ruling of the original judge.

In [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2005/706.html ''R. v Konzani''], the defence argued that by consenting to unprotected sexual intercourse with the defendant, the women were impliedly consenting to all the risks associated with sexual intercourse which included infection with HIV. In cross-examination two of the three women had explicitly acknowledged that, in general, unprotected sexual intercourse carried a risk of infection.

However the Appeal Court judges ruled that before the complainants' consent could provide the appellant with a defence, it had to be an informed and willing consent to the specific risk, here the risk of contracting HIV, rather than the general one of contracting ''something''. The same court held that a person accused of recklessly transmitting an STI could only raise the defense of consent, including an honest belief in consent, in cases where that consent was a "willing" or "conscious" consent.  In other words, the court distinguished between "willingly running the risk of transmission" and "willingly consenting to the risk of transmission." This suggests that consent will only operate as a defense{{spaced ndash}}in all but the most exceptional of cases{{spaced ndash}}where there has already been prior disclosure of known HIV positive status. Judge LJ. summaries the situation at para 42: In the public interest, so far as possible, the spread of catastrophic illness must be avoided or prevented. On the other hand, the public interest also requires that the principle of personal autonomy in the context of adult non-violent sexual relationships should be maintained. If an individual who knows that he is suffering from HIV conceals this stark fact from his sexual partner, the principle of her personal autonomy is not enhanced if he is exculpated when he recklessly transmits HIV to her through consensual sexual intercourse. On any view, the concealment of this fact from her almost inevitably means that she is deceived. Her consent is not properly informed, and she cannot give an informed consent to something of which she is ignorant. Equally, her personal autonomy is not normally protected by allowing a defendant who knows that he is suffering from HIV which he deliberately conceals, to assert an honest belief in his partner's informed consent to the risk of the transmission of HIV. Silence in these circumstances is incongruous with honesty, or with a genuine belief that there is an informed consent. Accordingly, in such circumstances the issue either of informed consent, or honest belief in it will only rarely arise: in reality, in most cases, the contention would be wholly artificial. Baker (2009) in "Moral Limits of Consent" 12(1) ''[[New Criminal Law Review]]'' argues even if the consent in Konzani was genuine, that it like Brown was rightly decided, as Baker is of the view that a person cannot consent to irreparable harm of a grave kind without also degrading his or her humanity in the Kantian sense. Baker also argues that the Harm Principle provides an important constraint, as it prevents the consenter from being criminalized because it is only harm to others that is criminalisable under the Harm Principle—not harm to self. Therefore, it is only those who rely on consent to inflict grave harm on their fellow humans that are criminalized under Baker's proposals. However, Baker points out that ''R v. Brown'' is more borderline, as the harm in that case was  reversible and is not too different from having unnecessary plastic surgery that is no longer benefiting the patient—that is numerous surgical procedures which are clearly having a disfiguring rather than beneficial cosmetic effect.

==The public interest in preventing breaches of the peace==
In ''[[R v. Coney|R v Coney]]'' (1882) 8 QBD 534, members of the public who attended an illegal prize fight in a public place were convicted of aiding and abbetting an assault. They were cheering on the boxers whose conduct was likely to and did produce a breach of the peace, so any mutual consent given by the fighters was vitiated by the public nature of the entertainment irrespective of the degree of injury caused &lt;!--and/--&gt;or intended. Hence, the principal offence was committed and, since it would not have taken place had there been no crowd to bet and support the fighters, the secondary parties were also liable.

==Consent as an effective defense==
In properly regulated sport, there is a legal right to cause incidental injury. This is a criminal law version of the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] principle ''[[volenti non fit injuria]]'' ([[Latin]] for consent does not make an [actionable] injury) and the victim consents to run the risk (not the certainty) of injury arising within the rules of the game being played. This does not give sport a license to enact rules permitting acts that are clearly, excessively and maliciously violent. Even professional sport should have an element of fun while the players are, in the more extreme cases, given criminal as well as civil law protection (see ''R v Johnson'' (1986) 8 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr App R (S)]] 343 and ''R v Lloyd'' (1989) CLR 513 dealing with injuries inflicted on the rugby field in "off the ball" incidents). Thus, the consent in licensed boxing events is to intentional harm within the rules and a blow struck between rounds would be an assault.

===Horseplay===
Where the [[culture]] supports the playing of [[practical joke]]s and active physical interaction as a form of "fun", those who become a part of that culture must accept the local standards of contact and the injuries that might result. Thus, in ''R v Aitken and Others'' [1992] 1 WLR 1006, the victim was a serving member of the [[Royal Air Force]] and the fact that he had participated in practical jokes played on his companions was accepted as evidence that he had consented to become a victim when it was "his turn".

==Legal right to cause, or consent to, injury==
* Doctors and all health professionals have a general right to assume a patient's consent for necessary treatment (per [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Denning LJ]] in ''Bravery v Bravery'' (1954) 3 AER 59). So if a person is brought into a hospital unconscious, surgery to preserve life will not be unlawful. But, if the health authorities have actual notice that the patient does not consent, even necessary treatment will be unlawful unless either it becomes urgently necessary to take action to avoid death, or consent is given either by a spouse or relative, or by a court. There have been cases, for example, where it was not to be an assault for prison hospitals for force-feed a prisoner on hunger strike, but such cases are not of general application. When in doubt, consent should be sought from the courts. In any event, treatment will only be lawful if it is of therapeutic rather than cosmetic value. Similarly, tattooing, ear piercing and other cosmetic procedures will be lawful if there is actual consent.
* Parents and others who are ''[[in loco parentis]]'' have a limited right to administer reasonable parental punishment: see ''A v UK'' (1998) CLR 892 and ''H'' (2002) 1 Cr. App. R. 59, but teachers are prohibited from administering corporal punishment: s548 Education Act 1996:  ''Williams v Secretary of State for Education and Employment'' (2005) 2 All ER 1.
* In the UK, in [[Operation Spanner]], three men who consensually agreed to engage in consensual [[sadomasochism]], were convicted of [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]]. The resulting [[House of Lords]] case (''[[R v Brown]]'', colloquially known as "the Spanner case") ruled that [[informed consent|consent]] was not a valid legal defence for [[wounding]] and [[actual bodily harm]] in the UK, except as a foreseeable incident of a lawful activity in which the person injured was participating, e.g. surgery. The convictions are seen as controversial&lt;ref&gt;S Bottomley &amp; S Bronitt, ''Law in Context'' (3rd ed, Sydney: The Federation Press, 2006), Chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stjoelaw"&gt;http://www.stjosephs.s-tyneside.sch.uk/resources/Law/lawExtraReading/A2/Unit5/Consent.doc{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giles"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Criminal law in a nutshell|author=Giles, M.|ISBN=978-0-421-47440-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ad7zAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=2011-02-21|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CJ&amp;I407"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/criminal/memos/ucm40702.htm |title=Uncorrected Evidence m407 |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to issues of whether a government or one's [[Self#Individual rights|self]] is justified to control one's own body in private situations where the only harm may be temporary, and to volunteering adults who gave informed consent to the types of acts involved.

'''''Consent of the Networked: The Worldwide Struggle for Internet Freedom''''' is a book written by [[Rebecca MacKinnon]] and released in 2012. It discusses [[internet censorship]] and the ways in which companies which manage internet communication are assuming responsibilities formerly held by governments.

==Reviews==
The review published in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' described ''Consent of the Networked'' as "an excellent survey of the Internet's major fault lines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204369404577207363346183978 |title=Book Review: Consent of the Networked - WSJ.com |first=Luke |last=Allnutt |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=15 February 2012 |location=New York |issn=0099-9660 |accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Naughton]]'s review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that the book will "find its way on to reading lists in [[political science]]" for those interested in the relationship between Internet and the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/26/internet-companies-power-politics-freedom |title=Tech giants have power to be political masters as well as our web ones |author=[[John Naughton]] |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 February 2012 |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rachel Bridgewater's review in the [[Library Journal]] states, "She uses many real-life examples and anecdotes to illustrate the complex web of policy and technical infrastructure that allows governments and corporate interests to censor, surveil, and otherwise impede free expression and individual liberty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Consent of the Networked: The Worldwide Struggle for Internet Freedom|last = Bridgewater|first = Rachel|date = 2012|journal = Library Journal|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Construction law''' is a branch of [[law]] that deals with matters relating to building [[construction]], engineering and related fields. It is in essence an amalgam of [[contract law]], [[commercial law]], [[Urban planning|planning law]], [[employment law]] and [[tort]].  Construction law covers a wide range of legal issues including contract, negligence, [[Performance bond|bonds and bonding]], guarantees and [[sureties]], [[lien]]s and other security interests, tendering, construction claims, and related consultancy contracts. Construction law affects many participants in the construction industry, including [[financial institution]]s, [[Surveying|surveyor]]s, [[Quantity surveyor|quantity surveyor]]s, [[architect]]s, [[carpenter|builder]]s, [[engineer]]s, [[construction workers]], and planners.

==Specific practice areas==
Construction law builds upon general legal principles and methodologies and incorporates the regulatory framework (including security of payment, planning, environmental and building regulations); [[contract]] methodologies and selection (including traditional and alternative forms of contracting); subcontract issues; [[causes of action]], and liability, arising in contract, [[negligence]] and on other grounds; insurance and performance security; dispute resolution and avoidance.

Construction law has evolved into a practice discipline in its own right, distinct from its traditional locations as a subpractice of [[project finance]], [[real estate]] or corporate law. There are often strong links between construction law and [[energy law]] and [[oil and gas law]].

Some of the major areas a construction lawyer covers are:
*[[Alternative Dispute Resolution]]s
**Arbitration
**Dispute Review Boards (or other third party reviews)
**Mediation
**Structured negotiations
*Bankruptcy issues for contractors, owners, suppliers, etc.
*Bidding (tendering) disputes
*[[Planning permission|Building]] and other permits
*[[Building Information Modeling]]
*[[Contract law]]
**[[Change Order]]s (Variations)
**Construction claims
**[[Construction lien]]s
**Wage requirements ([[Davis-Bacon]] Act, etc)
**Payment and [[Prompt payment]]s acts
**Extensions of time
**Drafting construction contracts
**Industry-standard construction contracts
**Negotiating construction contracts
**Negotiating a termination claim, whether for convenience or for default
*Defective design or construction
*Delays and acceleration
*Employment Law including Immigration
*Environmental matters in construction
*[[False Claims Act]](s)
*Fire codes and regulations
*Fulfilling regulations for non-discrimination or other social impact legislation
*Insurances issues
**Damage, liability
**[[Indemnification]]
**[[Surety]] Law (Payment and Performance Bonds)
*Labor issues and strikes
*Licensing construction professionals
*[[Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States)|OSHA]], and other federal agencies
*Overinspection
*Project delivery systems, such as design-bid-build, Design-Build, Construction Manager (CM) at Risk or Agency CM
*Provide defense to businesses facing administrative actions such as delisting (loss of bid listing)
*Provide legal counsel
*Public construction
**Federal construction under FAR or other regulated procurements
**State contracting procedures
*State and local building codes
*Sustainable construction, e.g. [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]
*Litigation: trying construction cases in court
*Violations, safety or other regulatory

==Country specific practice==

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], there has been an active Society of Construction Law [http://www.scl.org.uk] since 1983, and there is now a European Society of Construction Law, and Societies of Construction Law in [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], and the [[UAE]].
The [[Joint Contracts Tribunal]] works on the most popular type of standard construction contracts and the latest suite of contracts from the JCT are the 2016 editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Contract families|url = http://www.jctltd.co.uk/category/contract-families|website = www.jctltd.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The form of contract most favoured by public bodies is the NEC contract suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NEC3 Contracts - Products - NEC Contracts|url = https://www.neccontract.com/Products/Contracts?gclid=CNv4qMOZxcgCFROeGwodJ20Jfg|website = www.neccontract.com|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some see Construction Law as another form of general contract law, it is a very specialised area and most people requiring advice on construction law in the UK would seek advice from construction law specialists.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the law requires money for work done to be paid in [[trust law|trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.iflr.com/Article/1984910/Channel/193438/Construction-law-Breach-of-trust-in-the-construction-industry.html |title=Construction law: Breach of trust in the construction industry |publisher=IFLR.com |date=1997-09-01 |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The Forum on Construction Law of the [[American Bar Association]] established in 1973 is the largest organization of construction lawyers in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/construction_industry/about_us.html|title=About Us - Forum on the Construction Industry|author=|date=|website=www.americanbar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The group includes law firms of every size, solo practitioners, in-house and government counsel, non-lawyers such as, construction professionals and the public sector representatives.  Forum members include those of owners, developers, design professionals, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, construction managers, lenders, insurers and sureties.

[[Standard form contract]]s promulgated by the [[American Institute of Architects]] have been the standard in the industry (insofar as building construction); the organization first published a form in 1888, and has over 200 forms, with revisions to selected forms happening typically every ten years.&lt;ref name=NewEra&gt;Klinger M. (2007). [http://www.aon.com/usa/attachments/a-new-era-in-standard-form-construction.pdf A New Era in Standard Form Construction Documents: a Rivalry Between the Old Guard American Institute of Architects And An Upstart Consortium Led by the Associated General Contractors of America]. Sedgwick, Detert, Moran &amp; Arnold LLP.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these forms have been criticized as unfair to contractors in favor of owners and architects, which led to the publication of [[ConsensusDocs]] standard contracts in September 2007. The ConsensusDocs Coalition includes 41 trade associations representing design professionals, owners, contractors, subcontractors and sureties in the design and construction industry. ConsensusDocs publishes more than 100 contract documents, addressing all methods of project delivery, and are written in the project's best interest versus one particular party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://attny.com/fragcin.html |title=The Government Contracts Law Report Government Contractor Articles |publisher=Attny.com |date=2001-01-07 |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering lead projects such as horizontal infrastructure use other standard form contracts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ejcdc.org/shop/|title=Products Archive - EJCDC - Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee|author=|date=|website=EJCDC - Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as those developed by the [[Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee]]. Recently several other organizations have developed contracts for use such as the [[Construction Management Association of America|CMAA]]&lt;ref&gt;https://cmaanet.org/cmaa-publications-0&lt;/ref&gt; (for projects using agency [[Construction management|CM]]) and the [[Design-Build]] Institute of America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dbia.org/resource-center/Pages/Contracts.aspx|title=Books &amp; Contracts|author=|date=|website=www.dbia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; for projects using design-build.

===South Africa===
The standard form construction law contracts, in use in [[South Africa]], include FIDIC, NEC, GCC and JBCC agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.markraminc.co.za/construction-law|title=Construction Law in South Africa |author=Markram Incorporated Attorneys |accessdate=2014-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction contracts==
Although no special contract formalities are required, it is normal practice to use standard-form contracts such as, in the UK, the JCT form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/en/topics/projects--construction/construction-standard-form-contracts/standard-form-contracts-jct/ |title=Standard form contracts: JCT |publisher=Out-law.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to expedite dispute resolution, standard forms have often provided for [[arbitration]] by a "board of arbitration" or professional arbitrator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MtaJpdS94O8C&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Managing and Litigating the Complex Surety Case - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-01-01 |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; although many now offer a choice between arbitration and litigation. Construction law has been affected by the requirements in public contracts, which include [[surety bond]]s and other procedures. In private contracts, the requirements are negotiated between the parties. As of 1998, the principles of construction law were "well established".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zsncOqJfkQC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Construction Contract Claims, Changes and Dispute Resolution - Paul Levin - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1998-01-01 |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Remedies for [[breach of contract]] are the same as in the ordinary law, and include [[damages]], [[wikt:repudiation|repudiation]], [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]], and [[specific performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelienzone.com/5-critical-construction-contract-terms-scope-price-payment-start-completion-video|title=Construction Contract Terms - Contract Terms - The Lien Zone|author=|date=30 January 2014|website=thelienzone.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, specific requirements relating to payments and [[adjudication]] provisions were introduced by the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996|url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/53/contents|website = www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were subsequently amended in Part 8 of the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009|url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/20/part/8|website = www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These requirements are generally known as the Construction Act requirements.  The requirements set out certain minimum provisions which must be included in any construction contract (as defined within the Act) and failure to comply with these requirements will cause the relevant provisions to be deleted and compliant provisions to be inserted in their place, which can lead to unexpected consequences for unsuspecting parties to a construction contract.

===Deviation===
When a plan has been adopted for a building, and in the progress of the work a change is made from the original plan, the change is called a "deviation".&lt;ref&gt; "[[Deviation (law)|Deviation]]" is a concept borrowed from both [[Insurance law]] and the [[Law of Carriage of Goods by Sea]], and cases such as ''[[Glynn v Margetson]]'' and ''[[Leduc v Ward]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;   When the contract is to build a house according to the original plan, and a deviation takes place, the contract shall be traced as far as possible, and the additions, if any have been made, shall be paid for according to the usual rate of charging.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[St Paul Fire and Marine v McConnell]]'' [1995] 2 LLR 116 CA, where contractors failed to inform insurers of a signification change to the specified foundations; (the builders failed to install piles, as the plans had required).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others''' was approved by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 2 December 1949&lt;ref&gt;General Assembly resolution 317(IV)&lt;/ref&gt; and entered into force on 25 July 1951. The preamble states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Whereas [[prostitution]] and the accompanying evil of the [[Human trafficking|traffic in persons]] for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and endanger the welfare of the individual, the family and the community"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As at December 2013, 82 states were party to the convention (see map). An additional 13 states had signed the convention, but had not yet ratified it.&lt;ref name=ratifications&gt;[https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=VII-11-a&amp;chapter=7&amp;clang=_en Signatories and ratifications status]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention supersedes a number of earlier conventions that covered some aspects of [[forced prostitution]]. Signatories are charged with three obligations under the 1949 Convention: prohibition of trafficking, specific administrative and enforcement measures, and social measures aimed at trafficked persons. The 1949 Convention presents two shifts in perspective of the trafficking problem in that it views prostitutes as victims of the procurers, and in that it eschews the terms "white slave traffic" and "women", using for the first time race- and gender-neutral language.&lt;ref name=entrepeneur&gt;[http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/90192936_2.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204041437/http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/90192936_2.html |date=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To fall under the provisions of the 1949 Convention, the trafficking need not cross international lines.&lt;ref name=entrepeneur/&gt;

==Provisions==
The Convention&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/trafficpersons.pdf Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others ]&lt;/ref&gt; requires state parties to punish any person who "procures, entices, or leads away, for purposes of prostitution, another person, even with the consent of that person", "exploits the prostitution of another person, even with the consent of that person" (Article 1), or runs a [[brothel]] or rents accommodations for prostitution purposes (Article 2). It also prescribes procedures for combating international traffic for the purpose of prostitution, including extradition of offenders.

Furthermore, state parties are required to abolish all regulations that subject prostitutes "to special registration or to the possession of a special document or to any exceptional requirements for supervision or notification" (Article 6). And also, they are required to take the necessary measure for the supervision of [[employment agency|employment agencies]] in order to prevent persons seeking employment, in particular women and children, from being exposed to the danger of prostitution (Article 20).

A dispute between the parties relating to the interpretation or application of the Convention may, at the request of any one of the parties to the dispute, be referred to the [[International Court of Justice]] (Article 22).

==Status==
A number of countries who have ratified the Convention expressed reservations in relation to the referral of disputes to the ICJ, and some countries have not ratified the Convention at all because of their objection to the presence of the article.

One of the main reasons the Convention has not been ratified by many countries is because it also applies to voluntary prostitution,&lt;ref name="Bantekas 2003 6"&gt;{{cite book |title= International Criminal Law 2/E |last= Bantekas |first= Ilias |author2=Susan Nash |year= 2003|publisher=Routledge |location= Cavendish |isbn= 1859417760 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MyP4tSaMA_IC&amp;vq=involuntary+prostitution&amp;dq=%22involuntary+prostitution%22+definition&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the presence of the term "even with the consent of that person" in Article 1. For example, in countries such as [[Germany]],&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_PTVTNVR|title=Prostitution: Sex is their business|date=2 September 2004|accessdate=15 December 2009|publisher=The Economist}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004" /&gt; [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref name="Economist-prostitution-2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TNVTGVRN|title=Policing prostitution: The oldest conundrum|publisher=The Economist|date=30 October 2008|accessdate=11 January 2010}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18368.htm US Department of State Report - Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkey]], and other countries, voluntary prostitution is legal and regulated as an "occupation".

The [[Trafficking protocol]] (2000) to the [[United Nations]] [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] has used a different definition of "trafficking" to that in the 1949 Convention,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antislavery.org/homepage/resources/Weissbrodt%20report%20final%20edition%202003.pdf Convention against Transnational Organized Crime] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050525114642/http://www.antislavery.org/homepage/resources/Weissbrodt%20report%20final%20edition%202003.pdf |date=2005-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been ratified by many more countries.

The [[Centre for Human Rights]], specifically the secretariat of the Working Group on Slavery, in close co-operation with the [[Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs]] of the Department of International Economic and Social Affairs, actively monitors the Convention.

'''The Decree ''On the Development of Digital Economy''''' — the decree of [[Alexander Lukashenko]], the President of the Republic of [[Belarus]], which includes measures to liberalize the conditions for conducting business in the sphere of high technologies. The project was initiated by a Belarusian entrepreneur [[Viktor Prokopenya]] and then was developed by the [[Belarus High Technologies Park]] and representatives of the Belarusian IT market. The decree was signed on December 21, 2017.&lt;ref name="signed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://president.gov.by/ru/official_documents_ru/view/dekret-8-ot-21-dekabrja-2017-g-17716/|title=Президент Республики Беларусь Александр Лукашенко 21 декабря подписал Декрет № 8 "О развитии цифровой экономики"|date=2017-12-21|publisher=Пресс-служба Президента Республики Беларусь |language = Russian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meduza"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://meduza.io/feature/2017/12/23/aytishnyy-gonkong-dlya-slavyanskogo-mira|title="Айтишный Гонконг для славянского мира" Что за "революционный" закон в IT-сфере приняла Белоруссия|date=2017-12-23|publisher=Meduza |language = Russian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the Decree introduction, Belarus has not only adopted the widespread institutions of UK law like convertible bonds, non-compete agreements, but also has become the first country in the world to legalize [[smart contract]]s.&lt;ref name="regulations" /&gt;

== History ==
In early 2017, the Belarusian IT community actively discussed prospects for the development of the industry and the possibility of supporting technology companies through the Belarus High-Tech Park. Critics acknowledged the institution’s contribution, but noted that the existing model of work created the conditions for the growth of custom [[software development]] and [[Information technology outsourcing|IT outsourcing]], but did not help companies that create their own software products. According to market participants, work for foreign companies did not create the prospect of rapid growth, and there was not enough system and a legal framework of [[Venture capital|venture financing]] for the development of Belarusian start-ups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.tut.by/economics/533481.html |title=Чудо или упущенные возможности?

Work on the plan was put in charge of [[Vsevolod Yanchevsky]], the President assistant, well-known for his liberal views, the head of the main ideological department of the presidential administration and the curator of the direction of ensuring state policy in the spheres of information and high technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kp.by/daily/26649.4/3668973/ |title=Увольнение Валерия Цепкало: еще вчера он обсуждал долгосрочные планы на будущее |author=Геннадий Можейко |date=2017-03-02 |publisher=Комсомольская правда |language = Russian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resignation of an irreplaceable head of the [[Belarus High Technologies Park]] [[Valery Tsepkalo]] on March 2, 2017 was unexpected for the industry. Representatives of the IT industry and journalists made an assumption that the resignation could be related to the failure to achieve a number of stated goals and targets in 2016 as well as Tsepkalo’s conservative and passive approach to the development of the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naviny.by/article/20170302/1488452859-uvolnenie-cepkalo-prezident-preduprezhdal-rebyata-prekratite-shalit |title=Увольнение Цепкало.

The President discussed with the technological entrepreneurs and investors Viktor Prokopenya and [[Mikhail Gutseriyev]] the idea of creating an IT Development Council that would unite representatives of relevant departments, businessmen and investors in the sphere of high technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belta.by/president/view/lukashenko-obeschaet-dalnejshuju-podderzhku-razvitiju-it-sfery-v-belarusi-237153-2017/ |title=Лукашенко обещает дальнейшую поддержку развитию IT-сферы в Беларуси |date=2017-03-13 |publisher=Новости Беларуси |language = Russian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://udf.by/news/economic/153654-lukashenko-navestil-kompanii-viktora-prokopeni-i-poobeschal-podderzhku-razvitiyu-it-sfery.html |title=Лукашенко навестил компании Виктора Прокопени и пообещал поддержку развитию IT-сферы |date=2017-03-13 |publisher=Udf.by |language = Russian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belta.by/president/view/lukashenko-poruchil-sozdat-v-belarusi-sovet-po-razvitiju-it-tehnologij-237206-2017/ |title=Лукашенко поручил создать в Беларуси совет по развитию IT-технологий |date=2017-03-13 |publisher=Новости Беларуси |language = Russian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, the President of Belarus appointed Vsevolod Yanchevsky as the new head of the High-Tech Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.tut.by/economics/535031.html |title=Присматривать за айтишниками доверили своему.

To develop a new decree, the administration of the High-Tech Park attracted representatives of the IT industry and expert community, held dozens of meetings with technology companies, as well as Belarusian and international legal and consulting firms, including Aleinikov &amp; Partners, Vlasova, Mikhel &amp; Partners, Baker Tilly Bel and others.&lt;ref name="regulations" /&gt; The concept of a decree named in the IT community "Decree on the High-Tech Park 2.0" was published for the first time in a number of sources in July 2017 and was widely discussed by market participants and economists during the summer.&lt;ref name="markovnik"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.tut.by/economics/552950.html |title=Айтишный топ против Чалого: А за "кастрированный блокчейн" еще придется извиниться |author=Николай Марковник |date=2017-07-26 |publisher=Новости Tut.by |language = Russian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.tut.by/economics/551605.html |title=Как будет выглядеть ИТ-страна: с беспилотниками, криптовалютами и без бюрократии |date=2017-07-17 |publisher=Новости Tut.by |language = Russian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, the draft was submitted to Alexander Lukashenko as a part of a package of liberal reforms of business legislation. During the discussion of Decree 2.0, the president suggested rethinking the title of the document, as its provisions affected not only the High-Tech Park, but also the Belarusian economy at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.tut.by/economics/561993.html |title=Ключевой документ по либерализации в экономике Беларуси вынесен на рассмотрение Лукашенко |date=2017-09-26 |publisher=Новости Tut.by |language = Russian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of December, a document called the "Decree on the Development of Digital Economy" had been approved by all authorized public authorities and again submitted to the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://udf.by/news/economic/166180-dekret-o-cifrovoy-ekonomike-soglasovan-v-samoy-liberalnoy-redakcii.html |title=Декрет о цифровой экономике согласован в самой либеральной редакции |date=2017-12-05 |publisher=Udf.by |language = Russian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, 2017, Alexander Lukashenko held a meeting on the draft of the decree with the government officials and well-known representatives of the IT community and announced that he planned to sign the document by the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://regnum.ru/news/2356902.html |title=Лукашенко назвал сроки подписания декрета о развитии цифровой экономики |date=2017-12-13 |publisher=Regnum |language = Russian|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree was signed by the president on December 21.&lt;ref name="meduza" /&gt;

In 2018, almost 200 companies became HTP residents. This is two times more than in the entire history of the Park. In 2006, 15 residents registered in the Park; as of November 2017, their number was 192&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://devby.space/news/chislo-rezidentov-pvt-vyroslo-do-192|title= Число резидентов ПВТ выросло до 192 |author= dev.by |date=2017-12-12 |publisher= |accessdate=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As of November 2018, 388 companies were residents of the Park. The export of IT in the first half of 2018 increased by more than 40% compared with the same period last year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dev.by/news/pyatiletku-za-god-pvt-uzhe-vypolnil-optimisticheskii-prognoz-ernst-and-young-na-2020-i |title= Пятилетку за два года.

== Key points ==
The provisions of the decree "On the Development of Digital Economy" create of a legal basis for the circulation of [[digital currencies]] and tokens based on blockchain technology, so that resident companies of the High-Tech Park can provide the services of stock markets and exchange offices with cryptocurrencies and attract financing through the [[Initial coin offering|ICO]]. For legal entities, the Decree confers the rights to create and place their own tokens, carry out transactions through stock markets and exchange operators; to individuals the Decree gives the right to engage in [[Bitcoin network|mining]], to own tokens, to acquire and change them for [[Belarusian ruble]]s, foreign currency and electronic money, and to bequeath them. Up to 1 Jan In 2023, the Decree excludes revenue and profits from operations with tokens from the taxable base. In relation to individuals, the acquisition and sale of tokens is not considered entrepreneurial activity, and the tokens themselves and income from transactions with them are not subject to declaration. The peculiarity of the introduced regulation is that all operations will have to be carried out through the resident companies of the High Technology Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=201696&amp;lang=ru |title=В чем прорыв будущего декрета об ИТ? |author=Артём Гарбацевич |date=2017-12-12 |publisher=Наша нiва |language = Russian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="articles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="regulations"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://news.tut.by/economics/558485.html |title= Декрет о развитии цифровой экономики: что написано в документе, обещающем великую ИТ-революцию  |date=2017-12-22 |publisher=Новости Tut.by |language = Russian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the decree includes:&lt;ref name="articles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="regulations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meduza" /&gt;
* Extension of the validity period of the special legal regime of the High-Tech Park until January 1, 2049, and expansion of the list of activities of resident companies. Under the new rules, developers of [[blockchain]]-based solutions, developers of [[machine learning]] systems based on [[artificial neural networks]], companies from the medical and biotechnological industries, developers of unmanned vehicles, as well as software developers and publishers can become residents. The list of promising areas is unlimited and can be expanded by the decision of the High-Tech Park supervisory board.
* Preservation of existing benefits for resident companies in the High-Tech Park, including the cancellation of the profit tax (instead of which a contribution of 1% of the gross revenues proceeding to the administration of the park is applied), reduced to 9% of the personal income tax rate for employees, and the right to contribute to the Social Protection Fund according to the national average figures, and not the actual salaries.
* Exemption of foreign companies providing marketing, advertising, consulting and other services to the residents of the High-Tech Park from paying [[value-added tax]], as well as paying income tax, which allows to promote IT products of Belarusian companies in foreign markets. To encourage investments, the Decree also exempts foreign companies from the tax on income from the alienation of shares, stakes in the authorized capital and shares in the property of residents of the High-Tech Park (under condition of continuous possession of at least 365 days).
* Introduction of individual [[English law]] institutions for residents of the High-Tech Park, which will make it possible to conclude [[Option (finance)|option contracts]], [[Convertible bond|convertible loan]] agreements, non-competition agreements with employees, agreements with responsibility for enticing employees, irrevocable powers of attorney and other documents common in international practice. This measure is aimed at simplifying the structuring of transactions with foreign capital.
* Simplification of the regime of currency transactions for residents of the High-Tech Park, including the introduction of a notification procedure for currency transactions, the cancellation of the mandatory written form of foreign trade transactions, the introduction of confirmation of the conducted operations by primary documents drawn up unilaterally. Also, the decree removes restrictions on resident companies for transactions with [[Digital currency|electronic money]] and allows opening accounts in foreign banks and credit and financial organizations without obtaining permission from the [[National Bank of the Republic of Belarus]].
* Simplification of the procedure for recruiting qualified foreign specialists by resident companies of the High-Tech Park, including the abolition of the recruitment permit, the simplified procedure for obtaining a work permit, and the visa-free regime for the founders and employees of resident companies with a term of continuous stay of up to 180 days.

== Discussion ==

The publication of the key points of the “Decree 2.0” in June 2017 was warmly received by the participants of the IT industry, but faced criticism from one of Belarusian economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dev.by/lenta/main/nedelya-za-10-ssylok-pryaniki-proekta-novogo-dekreta-o-parke-vysokih-tehnologiy |title=Неделя за 10 ссылок: пряники проекта нового декрета о ПВТ |date=2017-07-17 |publisher=Dev.by |language = Russian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A noteworthy episode was the remote debate of Sergei Chaly, an economist and the host of the TV show "Economics in lay terms", and Nikolay Markovnik, general manager of the investment company VP Capital Belarus, which belongs to Viktor Prokopenya. Chaly expressed his point of view in the release of his own program and an interview to the [[European Radio for Belarus]], and Markovnik - in columns on the Internet sources Dev.by, KYKY and [[Tut.By|TUT.BY]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.tut.by/economics/552119.html |title= Государство махнуло рукой на традиционную экономику и схватилось за соломинку IT?  |author=Сергей Чалый |date=2017-07-20 |publisher=Новости Tut.by |language = Russian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="debate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kyky.org/pain/sergey-prosnites-ili-5-voprosov-o-dekrete-pvt-i-kastrirovannom-blokcheyne-chalomu-ot-markovnika |title="Сергей, проснитесь!" или 5 вопросов о Декрете ПВТ и "кастрированном" блокчейне Чалому от Марковника |author=Николай Марковник |date=2017-08-01 |publisher=Kyky |language = Russian|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the economist, the authors of the decree draft should focus on the overall development of civil law reform, the beneficial effect of which would affect all sectors of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://euroradio.fm/ru/dekret-o-pvt-20-s-dvoynym-dnom-sergey-chalyy-otvechaet-aytishnikam |title="Декрет о ПВТ 2.0" с двойным дном. Сергей Чалый отвечает айтишникам |author=Павел Свердлов |date=2017-07-28 |publisher=Euroradio.fm  |language = Russian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Markovnik answered to Chaly that the reform should start in a testbox which would be used later for overall reform, so the authors of the Decree focused on the IT-sphere they understand and on the obstacles to its growth.

Chaly supposed that the tax preferences created by the Decree for the IT market within the High-Tech Park will be provided at the expense of taxes from other branches of the Belarusian economy. According to Markovnik, reducing the bureaucratic burden on the IT companies in the future will serve as a precedent for changes in other sectors of the economy (as it happened earlier with the introduction of a flat scale of income tax and contributions to the Social Protection Fund, first implemented in the High Technology Park in 2005, and then everywhere in 2009) and they are building [[Communism]] in IT sector. 

Chaly supposed that the activities of the resident companies of the park are not very promising given their record, since the IT startup market is controlled by large international corporations. Markovnik pointed out that the orientation of Belarusian IT companies to foreign markets means that the support of their work can only harm their foreign competitors, and the Belarusian economy will only benefit from increased tax revenues of IT companies. 

According to the economist, unmanned cars are not introduced into Belarus and have no demand for their current price, crypto-currencies could be risky economic bubbles, and the technology of the blockchain is technical not legal, and is only applicable to the operation of cryptocurrencies. Markovnik, being himself a lawyer, also blamed the opponent for not understanding modern technologies (unmanned cars, blockchain technology), claimed that the best world education is now offered at [[Coursera]] and [[Khanacademy]], and noted that the expanded list of the directions of work at the High-Tech Park was drawn up taking into account the main trends, and the Decree creates the legal basis necessary for the development of breakthrough technologies.&lt;ref name="debate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="markovnik" /&gt;

One of the developers of the document, attorney Denis Aleinikov noted that as a result of the Decree introduction, Belarus has not only adopted the widespread institutions of UK law like convertible bonds, non-compete agreements, but also has become the first country in the world to legalize [[smart contract]]s.&lt;ref name="regulations" /&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Tut.by]] reported that due to one of the tax benefits of Decree, social security payments are levied from employers and paid to the employees of IT companies calculated not on the basis of their real amounts, which are substantially higher than the average salary, but calculated and paid based on the amount of the country average salary. This leads to low social payments to IT employees for the sick leaves, consequently, IT employees prefer not to take sick leave. Moreover, pension would also be calculated for such employees in the same way, and only few IT employees start to think about their future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://finance.tut.by/news600666.html?utm_source=news.tut.by&amp;utm_medium=news-bottom-block&amp;utm_campaign=relevant_news |title="До последнего ходят на работу".

'''''Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corp Ltd''''' [1992] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1992/1992_34.html UKPC 34] is a New Zealand [[insolvency law]] case decided by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] concerning the nature and extent of the liability of a mortgagee, or a receiver and manager, to a mortgagor or a subsequent debenture holder for his actions.

==Facts==

Glen Eden Motors Ltd was a New Zealand company with [[Fiat]] and [[Mazda]] car selling franchises. It gave a first [[debenture]], securing $230,000 to [[Westpac]], having priority over a second debenture issued to First City Corporation Ltd ("FCC"). Both loans were secured by a [[floating charge]] over all assets, and each contained the power to appoint a [[receiver and manager]] (i.e., an  [[administrative receiver]]), who would be deemed to be an agent of the company, authorized to do any acts which the company could perform.

Glen Eden defaulted on the debenture with FCC, and the latter appointed receivers. The receivers thought the business was unprofitable and should be closed down, and removed the manager of Glen Eden. The ousted manager consulted Russell on the matter. As a result, Downsview Nominees Ltd (controlled by Russell) was assigned Westpac’s first debenture, and Russell became the receiver and manager under it. The ousted manager was reinstated, and First City’s receivers were relegated to a residual role.

Fearing a poor outcome, First City then offered Downsview Nominees all moneys owing under the first debenture (so it would be redeemed and First City could take charge), or alternatively to sell its second debenture to Downsview on similar terms, but this offer was declined. Glen Eden issued a third debenture to Downsview and Russell carried on the business, losing a further $500,000. First City claimed that Russell (as receiver) and Downsview Nominees (as prior debenture holder) had violated their duties to First City to:

* exercise their powers for proper purposes
* act honest and in good faith
* exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence
* discharge the Westpac debenture as soon as they were in a position to do so
* transfer any surplus assets for First City after such satisfaction of that debenture.

==The courts below==

After an initial order in January 1988 to transfer the Westpac debenture on terms (which Russell contested and sought to avoid), in August 1989, the [[High Court of New Zealand]] held that Russell and Downsview acted for their own purposes, and not for proper purposes, in the matter and were thus liable in negligence to First City. Russell was also prohibited from acting as a director, promoter or manager of any company for five years, under s. 189 of the ''Companies Act'' of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;since replaced by the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0105/latest/DLM319570.html ''Companies Act 1993'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On appeal, the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand]] quashed the High Court's order insofar as it related to Downsview and First City Finance (to which First City had assigned the second debenture), and also quashed the disqualification order against Russell, as the court did not have such jurisdiction under the Act.

On application to the Privy Council, Russell appealed the Court of Appeal's order against him, and First City cross-appealed against Russell and Downsview to have the High Court orders reinstated.

==Judgment==

The Privy Council ruled that the High Court's order against Russell and Downsview should be restored, but upheld the quashing of the disqualification order against Russell.

In his ruling, Lord Templeman held that:

* Russell had been in breach of duty because he had not used his powers for a proper purpose, meeting the Managing Director’s wishes.
* Downsview should have accepted First City’s offer to redeem the debenture, and so First City should be compensated.
* This was not a [[negligence]] action. A general [[duty of care]] was not owed because this was "inconsistent with the right of the mortgagee and the duties which the courts applying equitable principles have imposed on the mortgagee." Yet the duty to act in good faith and for proper purposes was owed in [[Equity (legal concept)|equity]]:

{{Cquote|Several centuries ago equity evolved principles… first, that a mortgage is security for the repayment of a debt and, secondly, that a security for repayment of a debt is only a mortgage. From these principles flowed two rules, first, that powers conferred on a mortgagee must be exercised in good faith for the purpose of obtaining repayment and secondly that, subject to the first rule, powers conferred on a mortgagee may be exercised although the consequences may be disadvantageous to the borrower. These principles apply also to a receiver and manager appointed by the mortgagee.’

[...]

But since a mortgage is only security for a debt, a receiver and manager commits a breach of duty if he abuses his powers by exercising them otherwise than ‘for the special purpose of enabling the assets comprised in the debenture holders’ security to be served and realised.’ &lt;ref&gt;[[Jenkins LJ]], ''Re B Johnson &amp; Co (Builders) Ltd'' [1955] Ch 634&lt;/ref&gt;

[...] ''[[ab initio]]'' and throughout the receivership the second defendant [Russell] did not exercise his powers for proper purposes....

If a mortgagee exercises his power of sale in good faith for the purpose of protecting his security, he is not liable to the mortgagor even though he might have obtained a higher price and even though the terms might be regarded as disadvantageous to the mortgagor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Cuckmere Brick Co Ltd v Mutual Finance Ltd|link=Cuckmere Brick Co v Mutual Finance|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1971|num=9|para=|eucase=|parallelcite=[1971] Ch 949|date=25 February 1971|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is… authority… that, if the mortgagee decides to sell, he must take reasonable care to obtain a proper price but is no authority for any wider proposition....

The duties imposed by equity on a mortgagee and on a receiver and manager would be quite unnecessary if there existed a general duty in negligence to take reasonable care in the exercise of powers and to take reasonable care in dealing with the assets of the mortgagor company....

A mortgagee owes a general duty to subsequent encumbrances and to the mortgagor to use his powers for the sole purpose of securing repayments of the moneys owing under his mortgage and a duty to act in good faith.}}

==Background==
In 313 the emperor [[Constantine I]], together with his eastern counterpart [[Licinius]], issued the [[Edict of Milan]], which granted [[religious toleration]] and [[religious freedom|freedom]] for persecuted Christians. By 325 [[Arianism]], a school of [[christology]] which contended that Christ did not possess the divine essence of the Father but was rather a primordial creation and an entity subordinate to God, had become sufficiently widespread and controversial in [[Early Christianity]] that Constantine called the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in an attempt to end the controversy by establishing an empire-wide, i.e., "ecumenical" [[orthodoxy]]. The council produced the [[Nicene Creed#The original Nicene Creed of 325|original text]] of the [[Nicene Creed]], which rejected the Arian confession and upheld that Christ is "true God" and "of one essence with the Father."&lt;ref name="EmpireBay"&gt;Williams &amp; Friell, (1994) pp. 46–53&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the strife within the Church did not end with Nicaea, and the Nicene creedal formulation remained contentious even among anti-Arian churchmen. Constantine, while urging tolerance, began to think that he had come down on the wrong side, and that the Nicenes &amp;mdash; with their fervid, reciprocal persecution of Arians &amp;mdash; were actually perpetuating strife within the Church. Constantine was not baptized until he was near death (337), choosing a bishop moderately sympathetic to [[Arius]], [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]], to perform the baptism.&lt;ref name="EmpireBay" /&gt;

Constantine's son and successor in the eastern empire, [[Constantius II]] was partial to the Arian party, and even exiled pro-Nicene bishops. Constantius' successor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] (later called "The Apostate") was the only emperor after the conversion of Constantine to reject Christianity, attempting to fragment the Church and erode its influence by encouraging a revival of religious diversity, calling himself a "[[Hellenes (religion)|Hellene]]" and supporting forms of [[Hellenistic religion]]. He championed the [[Religion in ancient Rome|traditional religious ''cultus'' of Rome]] as well as Judaism, and furthermore declared toleration for all the various unorthodox Christian sects and schismatic movements. Julian's successor [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]], a Christian, reigned for only eight months and never entered the city of Constantinople. He was succeeded in the east by [[Valens]], an Arian.&lt;ref name="EmpireBay" /&gt;

By 379, when Valens was succeeded by [[Theodosius I]], Arianism was widespread in the eastern half of the Empire, while the west had remained steadfastly Nicene. Theodosius, who had been born in [[Hispania]], was himself a Nicene Christian and very devout. In August, his western counterpart [[Gratian]] promoted persecution of [[Heresy|heretic]]s in the west.&lt;ref name="EmpireBay" /&gt;

==Edict==
The Edict of Thessalonica was jointly issued by [[Theodosius I]], [[Gratian]], and [[Valentinian II]] on 27 February 380.&lt;ref name=Ehler65/&gt; The edict came after Theodosius had been baptized by the bishop [[Ascholius]] of Thessalonica upon suffering a severe illness in [[Early centers of Christianity#Greece|Thessalonica]].&lt;ref name="Ιερά Μητρόπολη Θεσσαλονίκης"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.imth.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&amp;loc=1&amp;&amp;page=147&amp;saintid=33 |title= Ἀχόλιος ἢ Ἀσχόλιος ἐπίσκοπος Θεσσαλονίκης |access-date= 2016-09-23 |publisher= Ιερά Μητρόπολη Θεσσαλονίκης |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160924104545/http://www.imth.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&amp;loc=1&amp;&amp;page=147&amp;saintid=33 |archivedate= 2016-09-24 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|EMPERORS GRATIAN, VALENTINIAN AND THEODOSIUS ''[[Augustus (honorific)|AUGUSTI]]''. EDICT TO THE PEOPLE OF [[Constantinople|CONSTANTINOPLE]].&lt;br&gt; It is our desire that all the various nations which are subject to our Clemency and Moderation, should continue to profess that religion which was delivered to the Romans by the divine [[Apostle Peter]], as it has been preserved by faithful tradition, and which is now professed by the [[Pope|Pontiff]] [[Pope Damasus I|Damasus]] and by [[Pope Peter II of Alexandria|Peter]], [[Bishop of Alexandria]], a man of [[Apostle (Christian)|apostolic]] holiness. According to the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic teaching]] and the doctrine of the [[Gospel]], let us believe in the one deity of the [[God the Father|Father]], the [[God the Son|Son]] and the [[Holy Spirit]], in equal majesty and in a holy [[Trinity]]. We authorize the followers of this law to assume the title of [[Catholicity|Catholic]] [[Christians]]; but as for the others, since, in our judgment they are foolish madmen, we decree that they shall be branded with the ignominious name of [[heretics]], and shall not presume to give to their conventicles the name of churches. They will suffer in the first place the chastisement of the [[Last judgment|divine condemnation]] and in the second the punishment of our authority which in accordance with the will of [[Heaven]] we shall decide to inflict.&lt;br&gt; GIVEN IN THESSALONICA ON THE THIRD DAY FROM THE [[Calends|CALENDS]] OF MARCH, DURING THE FIFTH [[Roman consul|CONSULATE]] OF GRATIAN AUGUSTUS AND FIRST OF THEODOSIUS AUGUSTUS&lt;ref&gt;Codex Theodosianus XVI.1.2&lt;/ref&gt;|''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'', [[:la:s:Codex Theodosianus - Liber XVI#I.2|xvi.1.2]]}}

==Importance==

The edict was issued under the influence of [[Ascholius]], and thus of [[Pope Damasus I]], who had appointed him. It re-affirmed a single expression of the Apostolic Faith as legitimate in the Roman Empire, "[[Catholic (term)|catholic]]" (that is, universal)&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Catholic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(cf. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2351864 Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'')]&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Orthodoxy|orthodox]]" (that is, correct in teaching).&lt;ref&gt;orthodox. Dictionary.com. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/orthodox Dictionary definition] (accessed: March 03, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the edict, Theodosius spent a great deal of energy trying to suppress all non-Nicene forms of Christianity, especially Arianism, and in establishing Nicene orthodoxy throughout his realm.&lt;ref name="CathEncyTheo"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Theodosius I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The edict was followed in 381 by the [[First Council of Constantinople]], which affirmed the Nicene Symbolum and gave final form to the [[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyd (1905), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; In 383, the Emperor ordered the various non-Nicene sects (Arians, [[Anomoeanism|Anomoeans]], [[Macedonians (religious group)|Macedonians]], and [[Novatianism|Novatians]]) to submit written creeds to him, which he prayerfully reviewed and then burned, save for that of the Novatians. The other sects lost the right to meet, ordain priests, or spread their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd (1905), p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Theodosius forbade heretics to reside within Constantinople, and in 392 and 394 confiscated their places of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd (1905), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Facebook, Inc.''' is an American online [[social media]] and [[social networking service]] company based in [[Menlo Park, California]]. Its website was launched on February 4, 2004, by [[Mark Zuckerberg]], along with fellow [[Harvard College]] students and roommates [[Eduardo Saverin]], [[Andrew McCollum]], [[Dustin Moskovitz]] and [[Chris Hughes]].

The founders initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students. Later they expanded it to [[List of colleges and universities in metropolitan Boston|higher education institutions in the Boston area]], the [[Ivy League]] schools, and [[Stanford University]]. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in this requirement, depending on local laws. The name comes from the [[face book]] directories often given to American university students. Facebook held its [[initial public offering]] (IPO) in February 2012, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company. It began selling [[stock]] to the public three months later. Facebook makes most of its revenue from [[advertising|advertisement]]s that appear onscreen.

Facebook can be accessed from a large range of devices with [[Internet]] connectivity, such as [[desktop computer]]s, [[laptop]]s and [[tablet computer|tablet]] computers, and [[smartphone]]s. After registering, users can create a customized profile indicating their name, occupation, schools attended and so on. Users can add other users as [[Friending and following|"friends"]], exchange messages, post status updates, share photos, videos and links, use various [[Application software|software applications]] ("apps"), and receive notifications of other users' activity. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other topics, and categorize their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends". Additionally, users can report or block unpleasant people.

Facebook has more than [[List of virtual communities with more than 100 million active users|2.2 billion monthly active users]] {{as of|2018|01|lc=y|post=.}} Its popularity has led to prominent media coverage for the company, including significant scrutiny over privacy and the psychological effects it has on users. In recent years, the company has faced intense pressure over the amount of [[fake news]], [[hate speech]] and [[Criticism of Facebook#Facebook Live|depictions of violence]] prevalent on its services, all of which it is attempting to counteract.

{{Main|History of Facebook}}

===2003–2006: Thefacebook, Thiel investment, and name change===
Zuckerberg wrote a program called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending [[Harvard University]] as a [[Sophomore year|sophomore]] (second-year student). According to ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', the site was comparable to [[Hot or Not]] and used "photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the "hotter" person".&lt;ref name="Harvard Crimson on Facemash"&gt;{{cite web |first=Katharine A. |last=Kaplan |title=Facemash Creator Survives Ad Board |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/11/19/facemash-creator-survives-ad-board-the/ |website=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |date=November 19, 2003 |accessdate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online.&lt;ref name="Fast Company on Zuckerberg"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ellen |last=McGirt |title=Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg: Hacker.

Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged by the administration with breach of security, violating [[copyright]]s, and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.&lt;ref name="Harvard Crimson on Facemash" /&gt; Zuckerberg expanded on this initial project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an [[art history]] final exam. He uploaded all art images to a website, each of which was featured with a corresponding comments section, then shared the site with his classmates, and people started sharing notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Kincaid |title=Startup School: An Interview With Mark Zuckerberg |url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/24/startup-school-an-interview-with-mark-zuckerberg/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 24, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "[[face book]]" is a student directory featuring photos and basic information.&lt;ref name="Fast Company on Zuckerberg" /&gt; In 2003, there were no universal online facebooks at Harvard, with only paper sheets distributed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Sarah |last=Phillips |title=A brief history of Facebook |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/jul/25/media.newmedia |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=July 25, 2007 |accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and private online directories.&lt;ref name="Harvard Crimson on Facemash" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvard Crimson on Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |first=Alan T. |last=Tabak |title=Hundreds Register for New Facebook Website |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/2/9/hundreds-register-for-new-facebook-website/ |website=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |date=February 9, 2004 |accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckerberg told the ''Crimson'' that "Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard. ... I think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week."&lt;ref name="Harvard Crimson on Facebook" /&gt; In January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website, known as "TheFacebook", with the inspiration coming from an editorial in the ''Crimson'' about Facemash, stating that "It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available ... the benefits are many."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Claire |last=Hoffman |title=The Battle For Facebook |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/the-battle-for-facebook-20100915 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Wenner Media |date=September 15, 2010 |accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "TheFacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lily |last=Rothman |title=Happy Birthday, Facebook |url=http://time.com/3686124/happy-birthday-facebook/ |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=February 4, 2015 |accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six days after the site launched, Harvard seniors [[Cameron Winklevoss]], [[Tyler Winklevoss]], and [[Divya Narendra]] accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called [[ConnectU|HarvardConnection.com]]. They claimed that he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nicholas |last=Carlson |title=In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg Broke Into A Facebook User's Private Email Account |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=March 5, 2010 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three complained to ''The Harvard Crimson'' and the newspaper began an investigation.

Alongside other American technology figures like [[Jeff Bezos]] and [[Tim Cook]], Zuckerberg hosted visiting Chinese politician Lu Wei, known as the "Internet czar" for his influence in the enforcement of China's online policy, at Facebook's headquarters on December 8, 2014. The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a Q&amp;A session at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, on October 23, 2014, where he attempted to converse in Mandarin—although Facebook is banned in China, Zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nation's burgeoning entrepreneur sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Alex |last1=Hern |first2=Jonathan |last2=Kaiman |title=Mark Zuckerberg addresses Chinese university in Mandarin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/23/mark-zuckerberg-chinese-university-fluent-mandarin-video |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=October 23, 2014 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book of Chinese president [[Xi Jinping]] found on Zuckerberg's office desk attracted a great deal of attention in the media, after the Facebook founder explained to Lu, "I want them [Facebook staff] to understand socialism with Chinese characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Adam Taylor |title=Why would Mark Zuckerberg want Facebook employees to read the Chinese president's book? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/12/08/why-does-mark-zuckerberg-want-facebook-employees-to-read-the-chinese-presidents-book/ |accessdate=December 14, 2014 |work=The Washington Post |date=December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015–present: Combating fake news and other ventures===
{{as of|2015|January|21|df=US}}, Facebook's algorithm is programmed to filter out false or misleading content, such as fake news stories and hoaxes, and will be supported by users who select the option to flag a story as "purposefully fake or deceitful news". According to Reuters, such content is "being spread like a wildfire" on the social media platform. Facebook maintained that "satirical" content, "intended to be humorous, or content that is clearly labeled as satire", will be taken into account and should not be intercepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alexei|last=Oreskovic|title=Facebook clamps down on fake news stories |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/20/us-facebook-hoaxes-idUSKBN0KT2C820150120|accessdate=February 4, 2015|work=Reuters |date=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm, however, has been accused of maintaining a "[[filter bubble]]", where both material the user disagrees with&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook |journal=Science |date=June 5, 2015 |pmid=25953820 |pages=1130–1132 |volume=348 |issue=6239 |doi=10.1126/science.aaa1160 |first=Eytan |last=Bakshy |first2=Solomon |last2=Messing |first3=Lada A. |last3=Adamic |bibcode=2015Sci...348.1130B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and posts with a low level of likes, will also not be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facebook Is Hiding Your Friends' Updates From You {{!}} Unicorn Booty|url = https://unicornbooty.com/facebook-is-hiding-your-friends-updates-from-you/|website = Unicorn Booty|accessdate = November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Zuckerberg prolonged period of paternity leave from 4 weeks to 4 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=shm&amp;sid1=105&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0008017659 |title=페이스북, 전세계 '아빠 출산휴가' 4주→4개월로 확대 |last=gong |date=November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, while [[Google]] users click on the first advertisement for search results an average of 8% of the time (80,000 clicks for every one million searches),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url=http://www.accuracast.com/seo-weekly/adwords-clickthrough.php |title=Google AdWords Click Through Rates Per Position |publisher=AccuraCast |date=October 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718064957/http://www.accuracast.com/seo-weekly/adwords-clickthrough.php |archivedate=July 18, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook's users click on advertisements an average of 0.04% of the time (400 clicks for every one million pages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url=http://valleywag.gawker.com/242234/facebook-consistently-the-worst-performing-site |title=Facebook 'consistently the worst performing site' |work=Gawker |date=March 7, 2007 |author=Denton, Nick |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701223257/http://valleywag.gawker.com/242234/facebook-consistently-the-worst-performing-site |archivedate=July 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful [[advertising campaign]]s on the site can have clickthrough rates as low as 0.05% to 0.04%, and CTR for ads tend to fall within two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url=http://techpulse360.com/2009/08/12/facebook-says-its-click-through-rates-do-not-match-those-at-google/ |title=Facebook Says Click Through Rates Do Not Match Those At Google |work=TechPulse 360 |date=August 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822055844/http://techpulse360.com/2009/08/12/facebook-says-its-click-through-rates-do-not-match-those-at-google/ |archivedate=August 22, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of Facebook's low CTR has been attributed to younger users enabling [[ad blocking]] software and their adeptness at ignoring advertising messages, as well as the site's primary purpose being social communication rather than content viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url=http://www.bizreport.com/2007/07/advertisers_disappointed_with_facebooks_ctr.html |title=Advertisers disappointed with Facebook's CTR |work=BizReport |date=July 16, 2007 |author=Leggatt, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to digital consultancy iStrategy Labs in mid-January 2014, three million fewer users aged between 13 and 17 years were present on Facebook's Social Advertising platform compared to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=3 Million Teens Leave Facebook In 3 Years: The 2014 Facebook Demographic Report |url=http://istrategylabs.com/2014/01/3-million-teens-leave-facebook-in-3-years-the-2014-facebook-demographic-report/ |work=iStrategy Labs |publisher=iStrategy Labs |accessdate=January 30, 2014 |author=DJ Saul |date=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Time'' writer and reporter Christopher Matthews stated in the wake of the iStrategy Labs results:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A big part of Facebook's pitch is that it has so much information about its users that it can more effectively target ads to those who will be responsive to the content.

However Microsoft has opted for a variation of the [[double Irish]] called the [[Single malt tax|single malt]], which relies on specific wording in the Ireland-Malta tax treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/multinationals-turn-from-double-irish-to-single-malt-to-avoid-tax-in-ireland-1.3290649 | title = Multinationals turn from Double Irish to Single Malt to avoid tax in Ireland | date = November 14, 2017 | work = Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To create a [[double Irish]] tax structure, a large quantum of [[intellectual property]] (or "IP") must be owned in a low-tax location, which the [[double Irish]] will then charge out to all non-US locations as a [[royalty payment]] (to relocate profits to the low-tax location). The US IRS is challenging Facebook Inc. on the valuation it used when it transferred IP from the US to Facebook Ireland in 2010 (which Facebook Ireland then revalued higher before charging out), as it was building it's [[double Irish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-exchanges/crypto-trading-tumbles-as-investment-scramble-unwinds-idUSKBN1HR1PJ|title=Facebook must give judge documents for U.S. tax probe of Irish unit|publisher=Reuters|date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesspost.ie/news/facebooks-dublin-hq-central-5bn-us-tax-probe-413079|title=Facebook's Dublin HQ central to $5bn US tax probe|publisher=Sunday Business Post|date=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case is ongoing and the IRS have noted that the potential quantum of fine is $3–5bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-28/facebook-ordered-to-comply-with-u-s-tax-probe-of-irish-unit|title=Facebook Ordered to Comply With U.S. Tax Probe of Irish Unit|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] changes Facebook's global tax calculations. Facebook Ireland will now be subject to the US GILTI tax of 10.5% on global intangible profits (i.e. Irish profits). On the basis that Facebook Ireland is paying some tax, the effective minimum US tax for Facebook Ireland will be circa 11%. In contrast, Facebook Inc. would incur a special IP tax rate of 13.125% (the FDII rate) if it's Irish business was relocated back to the US. Higher tax relief in the US (21% vs. Irish at the GILTI rate) and accelerated capital expensing, would make this effective US rate circa 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://home.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/us/pdf/2018/02/tnf-new-law-book-feb6-2018.pdf|title=KPMG Report on TCJA|publisher=KPMG|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/ideacast/2017/12/breaking-down-the-new-u-s-corporate-tax-law|title=Breaking Down the New U.S. Corporate Tax Law|publisher=Harvard Business Review|date=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = US corporations could be saying goodbye to Ireland|url = https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/us-corporations-could-be-saying-goodbye-to-ireland-1.3359050?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fus-corporations-could-be-saying-goodbye-to-ireland-1.3359050|work=Irish Times|date=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closeness of the net effective tax costs of having Facebook Ireland, in Ireland, or relocated back to the US, was shown when Reuters revealed that Facebook Ireland is going to move 1.5bn non-EU accounts back to the US to limit exposure to the EU Commission's May 2018 [[GDPR]].&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; To irrevocably limit financial exposure to the EU's GDPR, these 1.5bn non-EU accounts (and their commercial processing) must be moved to the US. Facebook said that this move "did not carry tax implications", a statement which was mistakenly interpreted as implying that processing would stay in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/19/facebook-moves-15bn-users-out-of-reach-of-new-european-privacy-law|title=Facebook moves 1.5bn users out of reach of new European privacy law|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website's primary color is blue as Zuckerberg is [[Red–green color blindness|red-green colorblind]], a realization that occurred after a test undertaken around 2007; he explained in 2010: "blue is the richest color for me—I can see all of blue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Generation Why? |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/25/generation-why/?pagination=false |work=The New York Review of Books |publisher=NYREV, Inc |accessdate=February 15, 2014 |author=Zadie Smith |date=November 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LETTER FROM PALO ALTO: THE FACE OF FACEBOOK |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/09/20/100920fa_fact_vargas?currentPage=all |work=The New Yorker |publisher=Condé Nast |accessdate=February 15, 2014 |author=Jose Antonio Vargas |date=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook is built in [[PHP]] which is compiled with [[HipHop for PHP]], a "source code transformer" built by Facebook engineers that turns PHP into [[C++]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Developer Blog – HipHop for PHP: Move Fast |url=https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2010/02/02/hiphop-for-php--move-fast/ |work=Facebook Developers |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=November 11, 2013 |author=Haiping Zhao |date=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deployment of HipHop reportedly reduced average CPU consumption on Facebook servers by 50%.&lt;ref name="Ars Technica BTS"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Paul |title=Exclusive: a behind-the-scenes look at Facebook release engineering |url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2012/04/exclusive-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-facebook-release-engineering/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=April 5, 2012 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook is developed as one monolithic application. According to an interview in 2012 with Chuck Rossi, a build engineer at Facebook, Facebook compiles into a 1.5&amp;nbsp; GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom [[BitTorrent]]-based release system. Rossi stated that it takes about 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process has zero downtime and new changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.&lt;ref name="Ars Technica BTS"/&gt;

Facebook uses a combination platform based on [[HBase]] to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, new events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them into storage. The user interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] behavior. These requests are written to a log file using [[Scribe (log server)|Scribe]] (developed by Facebook).&lt;ref name="high scalability"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/22/facebooks-new-realtime-analytics-system-hbase-to-process-20.html |title=Facebook's New Real-time Analytics System: HBase To Process 20 Billion Events Per Day |publisher=Highscalability.com |date=March 22, 2011 |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out (thus the name). Ptail data are separated out into three streams so they can eventually be sent to their own clusters in different [[data center]]s (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot article will generate a lot of impressions and news feed impressions which will cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a [[hash table]].&lt;ref name="high scalability" /&gt;

After this, data is output in PHP format (compiled with [[HipHop for PHP]]). The backend is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions are used to make the web pages display more quickly. The more and longer data is cached the less realtime it is. The data is then sent to [[MapReduce]] servers so it can be queried via Hive. This also serves as a backup plan as the data can be recovered from Hive. Raw logs are removed after a period of time.&lt;ref name="high scalability" /&gt;

On March 20, 2014, Facebook announced a new open-source programming language called [[Hack (programming language)|Hack]]. Before public release, a large portion of Facebook was already running and "battle tested" using the new language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2014/03/facebook-hack/ |title=Facebook Introduces 'Hack', the Programming Language of the Future |date=March 20, 2014 |work=Wired |first=Cade |last=Metz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook uses the Momentum platform from Message Systems to deliver the enormous volume of emails it sends to its users every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2014/10/06/message-systems-email-provider/ |title=The biggest email provider you've never heard of |date=October 6, 2014 |work=Fortune |first=Heather |last=Clancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
On July 20, 2008, Facebook introduced "Facebook Beta", a significant redesign of its user interface on selected networks. The Mini-Feed and Wall were consolidated, profiles were separated into tabbed sections, and an effort was made to create a cleaner look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/idg/IDG_852573C4006938800025748D0064C292.html |title=Facebook Facelift Targets Aging Users and New Competitors |work=The New York Times |author=Havenstein, Heather |date=July 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially giving users a choice to switch, Facebook began migrating all users to the new version starting in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.new.facebook.com/blog.php?post=30074837130 |title=Moving to the new Facebook |publisher=The Facebook Blog |accessdate=September 12, 2008 |author=Slee, Mark |date=September 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, 2008, it was announced that Facebook was testing a simpler signup process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Arrington |authorlink=Michael Arrington |title=Facebook Testing Even Simpler Sign Up; Closing The Gap With MySpace In The U.S. |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/12/11/facebook-testing-even-simpler-sign-up-closing-the-gap-with-myspace-in-the-us/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=December 11, 2008 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Facebook expanded the options for a user's gender setting, adding a custom input field that allows users to choose from a wide range of gender identities. Users can also set which set of gender-specific pronoun should be used in reference to them throughout the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Jordan |last1=Crook |first2=Josh |last2=Constine |title=Facebook Opens Up LGBTQ-Friendly Gender Identity And Pronoun Options |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/facebook-gender-identity/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=February 13, 2014 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facebook expands gender options: transgender activists hail 'big advance' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/13/transgender-facebook-expands-gender-options |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=February 14, 2014 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alexei |last=Oreskovic |title=In new profile feature, Facebook offers choices for gender identity |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-gender-idUSBREA1C1RU20140214 |website=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |date=February 13, 2014 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, Facebook introduced a feature to allow users to ask for information not disclosed by other users on their profiles.

===News Feed===
{{Main|News Feed}}
On September 6, 2006, [[News Feed (Facebook)|News Feed]] was announced, which appears on every user's homepage and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays of the user's friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2207967130 |title=Facebook Gets a Facelift |accessdate=February 11, 2008 |last=Sanghvi |first=Ruchi |date=September 6, 2006 |publisher=The Facebook Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.colnect.com/2010/03/facebook-celebrate-your-birthday-every.html |title=Facebook: Celebrate Your Birthday Every Day |publisher=Colnect blog |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2006/tc20060908_536553.htm? |title=Facebook Learns from Its Fumble |work=BusinessWeek |location=New York |date=September 8, 2006 |author=Lacy, Sarah |authorlink=Sarah Lacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Zuckerberg issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Since then, users have been able to control what types of information are shared automatically with friends. Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts, and newly added friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/ebusiness/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=192700574 |title=Facebook Founder Apologizes In Privacy Flap; Users Given More Control |work=[[InformationWeek]] |location=New York |date=September 8, 2006 |author=Gonsalves, Antone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2010, Facebook was granted a patent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=7669123 |status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; on certain aspects of its News Feed. The patent covers News Feeds in which links are provided so that one user can participate in the same activity of another user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themelis-cuiper.com/22/us-patent-no-7669123.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515155132/http://themelis-cuiper.com/22/us-patent-no-7669123.html |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |title=US Patent No. 7669123 |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |publisher=Social Media |date=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patent may encourage Facebook to pursue action against websites that violate its patent, which may potentially include websites such as [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/02/26/facebook.patent/index.html |title=Facebook's news-feed patent could mean lawsuits |work=CNN |date=February 26, 2010 |accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most popular applications on Facebook is the [[Facebook features#Photo and video uploads|Photos]] application, where users can upload albums and photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Arrington |authorlink=Michael Arrington |title=Facebook Launches Facebook Platform; They are the Anti-MySpace |url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/05/24/facebook-launches-facebook-platform-they-are-the-anti-myspace/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=May 24, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos, compared with other [[image hosting service]]s such as [[Photobucket]] and [[Flickr]], which apply limits to the number of photos that a user is allowed to upload. During the first years, Facebook users were limited to 60&amp;nbsp;photos per album. As of May 2009, this limit has been increased to 200&amp;nbsp;photos per album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=87157517130 |title=Share More Memories with Larger Photo Albums |accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2305272732&amp;topic=7363 |title=Upload: 60 or 200 photos in the same album? |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Facebook |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029231740/https://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2305272732&amp;topic=7363 |archivedate=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2305272732&amp;topic=4947 |title=How can I add more than 60 photos to an album? |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Facebook |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029231801/https://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2305272732&amp;topic=4947 |archivedate=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2003726&amp;l=5f3c8&amp;id=1352160452 |title=Example of album from a regular user with a 200-photo limit |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy settings can be set for individual albums, limiting the groups of users that can see an album. For example, the privacy of an album can be set so that only the user's friends can see the album, while the privacy of another album can be set so that all Facebook users can see it. Another feature of the Photos application is the ability to "[[tag (metadata)|tag]]", or label, users in a photo. For instance, if a photo contains a user's friend, then the user can tag the friend in the photo. This sends a notification to the friend that she has been tagged, and provides a link to see the photo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=March 15, 2008 |url=https://www.facebook.com/help.php?page=7 |title=Photos |publisher=Facebook |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731205244/https://www.facebook.com/help.php?page=7 |archivedate=July 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 7, 2012, Facebook launched its App Center to its users.

On May 13, 2015, Facebook in association with major news portals launched a program "Instant Articles" to provide rich news experience. Instant articles provides users, access to articles on Facebook news feed without leaving the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.fb.com/2015/05/12/instantarticles/ |title=Introducing Instant Articles – Facebook Media |work=fb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://previewtech.net/facebook-launches-instant-articles/ |title=Facebook launches "Instant Articles" |work=Preview Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the technology news website [[Gizmodo]] on May 9, 2016, Facebook curators routinely suppress or promote news that is deemed to meet a political agenda. For example, articles about [[Black Lives Matter]] would be listed even if they did not meet the trending criteria of News Feed. Likewise, positive news about conservative political figures were regularly excised from Facebook pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006/ |title=Former Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, Facebook launched Facebook Stories for iOS and Android in Ireland. The feature, following the format of Snapchat and Instagram stories, allows users to upload photos and videos that appear above friends' and followers' News Feeds and disappear after 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Facebook Stories puts a Snapchat clone above the News Feed |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/25/facebook-stories/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2017, Facebook introduced the [[Facebook 3D Posts|3D Posts]] feature to allow for uploading interactive 3D assets in the News Feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rachel |last=Franklin |title=Building Connections Through Creativity and Opening VR to Everyone |url=https://www.oculus.com/blog/building-connections-through-creativity-and-opening-vr-to-everyone/ |website=Oculus |date=October 11, 2017 |accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 11, 2018, Facebook announced that it would be changing its News Feed algorithm to prioritize what friends and family share and de-emphasize content from media companies. The change was intended to maximize the "meaningful interactions" that people have with content on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/technology/facebook-news-feed.html |title=Facebook Overhauls News Feed to Focus on What Friends and Family Share |last=Isaac |first=Mike |date=2018 |work=The New York Times|access-date=January 17, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Like button===

The "like" button, stylized as a "thumbs up" icon, was first enabled on February 9, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Kincaid |title=Facebook Activates "Like" Button; FriendFeed Tires Of Sincere Flattery |url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/09/facebook-activates-like-button-friendfeed-tires-of-sincere-flattery/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=February 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enables users to easily interact with status updates, comments, photos and videos, links shared by friends, and advertisements.

In March 2015, Facebook announced that it would start letting businesses and users interact through Messenger with features such as tracking purchases and receiving notifications, and interacting with customer service representatives. It also announced that third-party developers could integrate their apps into Messenger, letting users enter an app while inside Messenger and optionally share details from the app into a chat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Hope |last=King |title=7 big changes coming to Facebook |url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/25/technology/facebook-f8-messenger/ |website=[[CNN]] |date=March 25, 2015 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, it introduced an [[API]] for developers to build [[Software agent|chatbots]] into Messenger, for uses such as news publishers building bots to give users news through the service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Facebook launches a bot platform for Messenger |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/12/11395806/facebook-messenger-bot-platform-announced-f8-conference |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=April 12, 2016 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 2017, it enabled the [[M (virtual assistant)|M virtual assistant]] for users in the U.S., which scans chats for keywords and suggests relevant actions, such as its payments system for users mentioning money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Statt |title=Facebook's AI assistant will now offer suggestions inside Messenger |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/6/15200836/facebook-messenger-m-suggestions-ai-assisant |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=April 6, 2017 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Facebook Messenger's AI 'M' suggests features to use based on your convos |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/facebook-messengers-ai-m-suggests-features-to-use-based-on-your-convos/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=April 6, 2017 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Facebook expanded the use of bots, incorporating group chatbots into Messenger as "Chat Extensions", adding a "Discovery" tab for finding bots, and enabling special, branded [[QR code]]s that, when scanned, take the user to a specific bot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Facebook Messenger launches group bots and bot discovery tab |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/18/facebook-bot-discovery/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=April 18, 2017 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Following===
On September 14, 2011, Facebook added the ability for users to provide a "Subscribe" button on their page, which allows users to subscribe to public postings by the user without needing to add him or her as a friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Meghan Peters |url=http://mashable.com/2011/09/15/facebook-subscribe-users/ |title=Facebook Subscribe Button: What It Means for Each Type of User |publisher=Mashable.com |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction, Facebook also introduced a system in February 2012 to verify the identity of certain accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Facebook Launches Verified Accounts and Pseudonyms |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/15/facebook-verified-accounts-alternate-names/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, Facebook announced that because of user confusion surrounding its function, the Subscribe button would be re-labeled as a "Follow" button{{emdash}}making it more similar to other social networks with similar functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ellis |last=Hamburger |title=Facebook snubs 'Subscribe' button in favor of Twitter-esque 'Follow' on all profile pages |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/5/3731986/facebook-like-follow |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=December 5, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with Myspace===
The media often compares Facebook to [[Myspace]], but one significant difference between the two Web sites is the level of customization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=March 8, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/technology/25social.html |title=Facebook Expands Into MySpace's Territory |work=The New York Times |author=Stone, Brad |date=May 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another difference is Facebook's requirement that users give their true identity, a demand that MySpace does not make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=September 10, 2010 |url=http://mobilitytoday.com/news/009500/facebook_connect_mt |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024033731/http://mobilitytoday.com/news/009500/facebook_connect_mt |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |title=Facebook Connect fully integrated into Mobility Today |publisher=Mobility Today Fitness |date=May 7, 2009 |author=Ciccone, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; MySpace allows users to decorate their profiles using [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS), while Facebook allows only [[plain text]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=April 30, 2008 |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,134635-c,categories/article.html |title=Is Facebook the New MySpace? |work=[[PC World]] |location=San Francisco |date=July 24, 2007 |author=Sullivan, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has a number of features with which users may interact. They include the [[Tag (Facebook)|Wall]], a space on every user's profile page that allows friends to post messages for the user to see;&lt;ref name="off"&gt;{{cite web |last=Der |first=Kevin |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=3532972130 |title=Facebook is off-the-wall |accessdate=July 30, 2007 |publisher=The Facebook Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Super Poke|Pokes]], which allows users to send a virtual "poke" to each other (a notification then tells a user that he or she has been poked);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=March 9, 2008 |url=https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=210552142308915&amp;ref_query=pok |title=Inbox, Messages and Pokes |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook features#Photo and video uploads|Photos]], that allows users to upload albums and photos;&lt;ref name="gifts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2406207130 |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |title=The Facebook Gifts |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Facebook features#Status updates|Status]], which allows users to inform their friends of their whereabouts and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,25642,22822400-5014108,00.html |title=Facebook is&amp;nbsp; ... reconsidering the word "is" |accessdate=March 8, 2008 |work=news.com.au Technology blog |first=Andrew |last=Ramadge |date=November 26, 2007 |location=Sydney |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128222428/http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0%2C25642%2C22822400-5014108%2C00.html |archivedate=November 28, 2007 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook also allows users to tag various people in photographs. Depending on privacy settings, anyone who can see a user's profile can also view that user's Wall. In July 2007, Facebook began allowing users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas the Wall was previously limited to textual content only.&lt;ref name="off" /&gt; Facebook also differs from Myspace in the form of advertising used. Facebook uses advertising in the form of banner ads, referral marketing, and games. Myspace, on the other hand, uses [[Google]] and [[AdSense]].&lt;ref name="diffen.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.diffen.com/difference/Facebook_vs_MySpace |title=Facebook vs MySpace – Difference and Comparison – Diffen |work=diffen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a difference in the userbase of each site. MySpace, initially, was much more popular with high school students, while Facebook was more popular among college students. A study by the American firm Nielsen Claritas showed that Facebook users are more inclined to use other professional networking sites, such as [[LinkedIn]], than Myspace users.&lt;ref name="diffen.com" /&gt;

===Privacy===

Facebook enables users to choose their own privacy settings and choose who can see specific parts of their profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=June 13, 2009 |url=https://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=search |title=Search Privacy |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website is free to its users and generates revenue from advertising, such as [[Web banner|banner ads]].&lt;ref name="tc"&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=March 9, 2008 |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6066533.html |title=Facebook goes corporate |work=[[ZDNet]] News |date=April 28, 2006 |author=Barton, Zoe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526001748/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6066533.html |archivedate=May 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook requires a user's name and profile picture (if applicable) to be accessible by everyone.

Its purpose was to allow targeted advertisements and allowing users to share their activities with their friends.

In 2010, Facebook's security team began expanding its efforts to reduce the risks to users' privacy,&lt;ref name="revealed"&gt;{{cite web |title=Revealed: Which social networks pose the biggest risk? |url=http://www.sophos.com/blogs/gc/g/2010/02/01/revealed-social-networks-pose-biggest-risk/ |publisher=[[Sophos]] |last=Cluley |first=Graham |date=February 1, 2010 |accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Criticism of Facebook#Privacy concerns|privacy concerns]] remain.&lt;ref name="liebertpub1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/cyber.2012.0323 |pmid=23374170 |title=Who Commits Virtual Identity Suicide?

On November 29, 2011, Facebook settled [[Federal Trade Commission]] charges that it deceived consumers by failing to keep privacy promises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=November 29, 2011 |url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2011/11/privacysettlement.shtm |title=Facebook Settles FTC Charges That It Deceived Consumers By Failing To Keep Privacy Promises |work=[[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] |date=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013 [[High-Tech Bridge]] published a study showing that links included in Facebook messaging service messages were being accessed by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.htbridge.com/news/social_networks_can_robots_violate_user_privacy.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140103153742/https://www.htbridge.com/news/social_networks_can_robots_violate_user_privacy.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 3, 2014 |title=Social networks: can robots violate user privacy? |date=August 27, 2013 |accessdate=January 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 two users filed a lawsuit against Facebook alleging that their privacy had been violated by this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Grove |first1=Jennifer |title=Facebook sued for allegedly intercepting private messages |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-sued-for-allegedly-intercepting-private-messages/ |website=[[CNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 16, 2015 |date=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, in the wake of the [[#Cambridge Analytica|Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal]], and refuting a report to the contrary by [[Reuters]], Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would implement additional privacy "controls and settings" worldwide.&lt;ref name="guar1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Solon |first1=Olivia |title=Fact-checking Mark Zuckerberg's testimony about Facebook privacy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/11/fact-checking-mark-zuckerberg-testimony-congress |accessdate=June 29, 2018 |publisher=The Guardian |date=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These settings were originally intended for deployment in Europe in order to comply with the European Union's [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR), which take effect in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/zuckerberg-gdpr/ |title=Zuckerberg says Facebook will offer GDPR privacy controls everywhere |website=TechCrunch |language=en-US|access-date=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead-up to its implementation, Facebook also changed its terms of service and privacy policy to specify that users within the European Union are served by Facebook Ireland, Ltd., while users outside of the EU are served by Facebook Inc., which is subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Previously, all users outside of Canada and the United States were served by Facebook Ireland, Ltd., which would make an additional 1.5 billion users subject to EU law in their use of Facebook than legally needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/facebook-removes-1-5-billion-users-from-protection-of-eu-privacy-law/|title=Facebook removes 1.5 billion users from protection of EU privacy law|work=Ars Technica|access-date=April 21, 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the breach, Facebook withdrew its opposition to the [[California Consumer Privacy Act]]. Facebook, Google, Comcast, AT&amp;T, and Verizon had previously donated $200,000 each to a $1 million fund dedicated to opposing of the [[ballot measure]]. The Committee to Protect California jobs, which opposed the ballot question and is sponsored by the [[California Chamber of Commerce]] told ''Ars Technica'' that "Facebook has NOT dropped its opposition to the measure".

On September 28, 2018, Facebook saw a drop in its share price by 3% due to a major breach in its security, exposing the data of 50 million users.

===Facebook Bug Bounty Program===
[[File:Facebook t-shirt with whitehat debit card for Hackers.jpg|thumb|A Facebook "[[White hat (computer security)|White Hat]]" debit card, given to researchers who report [[security bug]]s.]]

On July 29, 2011, Facebook announced its Bug Bounty Program in which security researchers will be paid a minimum of $500 for reporting security holes on Facebook's website. Facebook's Whitehat page for security researchers says: "If you give us a reasonable time to respond to your report before making any information public and make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service during your research, we will not bring any lawsuit against you or ask law enforcement to investigate you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://facebook.com/whitehat |title=Facebook |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2389460,00.asp |title=Facebook Offers $500 Bounty for Reporting Bugs: Why So Cheap |publisher=PC Magazine |accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook started paying researchers who find and report security bugs by issuing them custom branded "White Hat" debit cards that can be reloaded with funds each time the researchers discover new flaws. "Researchers who find bugs and security improvements are rare, and we value them and have to find ways to reward them," Ryan McGeehan, former manager of Facebook's security response team, told CNET in an interview. "Having this exclusive black card is another way to recognize them. They can show up at a conference and show this card and say 'I did special work for Facebook.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-hands-out-white-hat-debit-cards-to-hackers/ |title=Facebook hands out White Hat debit cards to hackers |publisher=[[CNET]] |accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India, which has the second largest number of bug hunters in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indian Security Researchers tops Facebook Bug Bounty Program |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-dna-special-indians-are-worlds-top-bug-bounty-hunters-1884018 |work=DNA Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt; tops the Facebook Bug Bounty Program with the largest number of valid bugs. "Researchers in Russia earned the highest amount per the report in 2013, receiving an average of $3,961 for 38 bugs. India contributed the largest number of valid bugs at 136, with an average reward of $1,353. The U.S. reported 92 issues and averaged $2,272 in rewards. Brazil and the UK were third and fourth by volume, with 53 bugs and 40 bugs, respectively, and average rewards of $3,792 and $2,950", Facebook quoted in a post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bug Bounty |first1=Facebook |title=Facebook Bug Bounty |url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-bug-bounty/bug-bounty-highlights-and-updates/818902394790655 |publisher=Facebook Security |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===User growth===
CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in August 2008 that Facebook had passed 100 million registered users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stan |last=Schroeder |title=Facebook's 100 Million Users: How Much are They Worth? |url=http://mashable.com/2008/08/26/facebook-100-million-users/ |website=[[Mashable]] |date=August 26, 2008 |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased to 150 million "active" users in January 2009.

Early in 2015, it was reported that teenagers preferred competing web sites such as [[Instagram]] and [[Snapchat]]. The estimated number of teens leaving Facebook was a million per year.&lt;ref name=wash&gt;{{cite news |first=Nico |last=Lang |title=Why teens are leaving Facebook: It's 'meaningless' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/02/21/why-teens-are-leaving-facebook-its-meaningless/ |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=February 21, 2015 |accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, after skepticism about the accuracy of its "monthly active users" measurement, Facebook changed its definition of an "active user", now defining it as a logged-in member who visits the Facebook site through the web browser or mobile app, or uses the [[Facebook Messenger]] app, in the last 30 days of the date of measurement. This excludes the use of third-party services with Facebook integration, which was previously counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Cohen |title=Facebook Changes Definition of Monthly Active Users |url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/monthly-active-users-definition-revised/ |website=[[Adweek]] |publisher=Beringer Capital |date=November 6, 2015 |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to analytics firm [[comScore]], Facebook is the leading social networking site based on monthly unique visitors, having overtaken its main competitor at the time, [[MySpace]], in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Arrington |authorlink=Michael Arrington |title=Facebook No Longer The Second Largest Social Network |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/06/12/facebook-no-longer-the-second-largest-social-network/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Caroline |last=McCarthy |title=ComScore: Facebook is beating MySpace worldwide |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/comscore-facebook-is-beating-myspace-worldwide/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=June 20, 2008 |accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; comScore reported that Facebook attracted over 130&amp;nbsp;million unique visitors in May 2010, an increase of 8.6&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Erick |last=Schonfeld |title=Privacy, Schmivacy: Facebook Is Attracting Near-Record Numbers Of New Visitors |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/07/privacy-facebook-visitors/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 7, 2010 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to third-party [[web analytics]] providers, [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] and [[SimilarWeb]], Facebook is ranked second and first globally respectively, it is the highest-read social network on the Web, with over 20 billion visitors per month, {{as of|2015|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="alexaranking"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/www.facebook.com |title=facebook.com Site Overview |publisher=[[Alexa Internet]] |accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="similarranking"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.similarweb.com/website/facebook.com |title=Facebook.com Analytics |publisher=[[SimilarWeb]] |accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.similarweb.com/category/internet_and_telecom/social_network |title=Top 50 sites in the world for Internet And Telecom &gt; Social Network |publisher=[[SimilarWeb]] |accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SimilarWeb]], [[Quantcast]], and [[Compete.com]] all rank the website 2nd in the U.S. in traffic.&lt;ref name="similarranking" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=September 9, 2010 |url=http://www.quantcast.com/facebook.com |title=Facebook.com Web Site Audience Profile |publisher=[[Quantcast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=September 9, 2010 |url=http://blog.compete.com/2010/02/17/we%E2%80%99re-number-two-facebook-moves-up-one-big-spot-in-the-charts/ |title=We're Number Two!

The reasons why Facebook scored so poorly include privacy problems, frequent changes to the website's interface, the results returned by the News Feed, and spam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Geoffrey A. |last=Fowler |title=Users Rate Facebook Slightly Above the Tax Man |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/07/20/users-rate-facebook-slightly-above-the-tax-man/ |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] |date=July 20, 2010 |accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, the [[Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory]] ruled that Facebook is a valid [[protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] to serve court notices to defendants.

However, with increasing scrutiny, Facebook issued a statement expressing alarm and suspended Cambridge Analytica, while review of documents and interviews with former Facebook employees suggested that Cambridge Analytica was still in possession of the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html |title=How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions |first1=Matthew |last1=Rosenberg |first2=Nicholas |last2=Confessore |first3=Carole |last3=Cadwalladr |date=March 17, 2018 |publisher= |via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a violation of the [[consent decree]] entered into law by Facebook with the [[Federal Trade Commission]], and violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company's possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/18/facebook-may-have-violated-ftc-privacy-deal-say-former-federal-officials-triggering-risk-of-massive-fines/ |title=Facebook may have violated FTC privacy deal, say former federal officials, triggering risk of massive fines |last=Timberg |first=Craig |date=March 18, 2018 |work=Washington Post|access-date=March 25, 2018 |last2=Romm |first2=Tony |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'' reporter [[Carole Cadwalladr]] who broke the story, both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica threatened to sue the newspaper if it published the story and continually tried to prevent its publication. After the story was published anyway, Facebook claimed that it had been "lied to". Cadwalladr said that Facebook was trying to shift the blame onto a third party. Nick Thompson of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' and [[CBS]] News pointed out that Cambridge Analytica obtained all the personal data without having to "breach" Facebook, and that "It didn't work because somebody hacked in and broke stuff, it worked because Facebook has built the craziest most invasive advertising model in the history of the world and someone took advantage of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cambridge-analytica-facebook-knew-for-two-years-no-action-taken/ |title=Facebook knew of illicit user profile harvesting for 2 years, never acted |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|You may have heard about a quiz app built by a university researcher that leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014. This was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time. We're now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again.

We've already stopped apps like this from getting so much information. Now we're limiting the data apps get when you sign in using Facebook.

We're also investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this. We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.

Finally, we'll remind you which apps you've give access to your information – so you can shut off the ones you don't want anymore.

Thank you for believing in this community. I promise to do better for you.}}

According to a study done by Jeffery Child and Shawn Starcher in 2015, Facebook is a social media platform where "both known and unknown audiences can gain access to posted context, increasing the possibility for privacy breakdowns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2015.08.035 |title=Fuzzy Facebook privacy boundaries: Exploring mediated lurking, vague-booking, and Facebook privacy management |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |volume=54 |pages=483–90 |year=2016 |last1=Child |first1=Jeffrey T |last2=Starcher |first2=Shawn C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has a history of making efforts of rapprochement for such privacy crises.

For tech firms, he argued in one interview, a goal should be to “have positive content pushed out about your company and negative content that’s being pushed out about your competitor.” A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast [[George Soros]], a frequent subject of [[Antisemitic canard|antisemitic conspiracy theories]] and hate speech, falsely as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement.

Facebook has now been involved in campaigns for ''[[True Blood]]'', ''[[American Idol]]'', and ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/04/19/4-ways-facebook-social-tv-1-video/ |title=Move Over Twitter: Facebook Wants a Piece of Social TV, Too |work=tvgenius: TV Trends Blog |author=Wells, Emma K. |date=April 19, 2011 |accessdate=May 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426131045/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/04/19/4-ways-facebook-social-tv-1-video/ |archivedate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; News and media outlets such as ''The Washington Post'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Washington Post |date=January 6, 2012 |title=Facebook data reveal what GOP presidential candidates' supporters 'like' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/facebook-data-reveals-what-gop-presidential-candidates-supporters-like/2012/01/06/gIQAOScufP_graphic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Financial Times''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e82978cc-3e19-11e1-ac9b-00144feabdc0.html |title=Romney tags Facebook to build momentum |date=January 16, 2012 |last=Dembosky |first=April}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ABC News&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=ABCNews.com |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/social-media-opens-trove-of-voter-info-to-campaigns/ |title=Social Media Opens Trove of Voter Info to Campaigns |date=January 10, 2012 |last=Bingham |first=Amy}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used aggregated Facebook fan data to create various infographics and charts to accompany their articles.

===Economic impact===
Facebook, Inc. has utilized growing internet markets using a social media platform to expand its user base while generating billions of dollars in revenue from Facebook's companies. Through empirical findings, economists have been able to identify key areas where Facebook has been able to stimulate economic activity by offering a free [[public good]] in that one user will not reduce the amount available to another, while also generating positive [[Externality|externalities]]. Thus, mobile phone manufactures and carriers have been beneficiaries of Facebook's [[spillover effect]]. Three distinct areas have been found to add the most economic impact: platform competition, the marketing place, and user behavior data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1017/CBO9781139060011.003 |chapter=The Economics of Internet Markets |title=Advances in Economics and Econometrics |pages=48–75 |year=2013 |last1=Levin |first1=Jonathan |isbn=978-1-139-06001-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook's daily active users have increased 18% year-over-year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://investor.fb.com/financials/ |title=SEC Quarterly Report |last= |first= |date=March 31, 2017 |website=Facebook, Inc.|access-date=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and burgeoning from 1 million users in 2004, to over 1.9 billion in 2017. Facebook began to reduce its carbon impact after being publicly criticised by Greenpeace for its long-term reliance on coal power and consequently high carbon footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/12/greenpeace-declares-victory-over-facebook-data-centers/ |title=Greenpeace Declares Victory Over Facebook Data Centers |publisher=WIRED |date= |accessdate=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2016, Facebook's total revenue earnings were $27.638 billion, gross profit was $23.849 billion and a net income for the year was $10.188 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/financials?p=FB |title=(FB) Income Statement |last= |first= |date=December 31, 2016 |website=Yahoo Finance|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802231028/http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/financials?p=FB|archive-date=August 2, 2016|dead-url=yes|access-date=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook provides a development platform for many [[social network game|social gaming]], communication, feedback, review, and other applications related to online activities. This open platform of Facebook has spawned many new businesses and added thousands of jobs to the economy. [[Zynga Inc.]], a leading company in social gaming app development, is an example of those businesses. An [[Econometrics|econometric]] analysis studied the impact of Facebook on the economy in terms of the number of jobs created and the economic value of those jobs. The conservative estimate was that the app development platform of Facebook added more than 182,000 jobs in the U.S. economy in 2011. The total economic value of the added employment was about $12 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Facebook App Economy |date=September 19, 2011 |publisher=University of Maryland |url=https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/files/Documents/Centers/DIGITS/AppEconomyImpact091911.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social impact===
{{Main|Social networking service#Social impact|Social impact of the Internet#Social networking and entertainment|Social capital}}
Facebook has affected the social life and activity of people in various ways. Facebook allows people using computers or mobile phones to continuously stay in touch with friends, relatives and other acquaintances wherever they are in the world, as long as there is access to the Internet. It has reunited lost family members and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7739245 |title=Father finds daughter on Facebook after 20 years apart |work=WABC |location=New York |date=October 23, 2010 |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.in.msn.com/international/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3570509&amp;= |title=Facebook reunites father, daughter after 48 years |work=MSN India |location=Delhi |date=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows users to trade ideas, stay informed with local or global developments, and unite people with common interests and/or beliefs through open, closed and private groups and other pages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/topics/1164/social-networks/chart/1103/top-10-social-networks-in-q1-2013/ Half of the World's Online Population Uses Facebook], GlobalWebIndex.

Facebook's social impact has also changed how people communicate. Rather than having to reply to others through email, Facebook allows users to broadcast or share content to others, and thereby to engage others or be engaged with others' posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/02/02/facebook-turns-10-cultural-impact/5063979/ |title=How Facebook changed our lives |date=February 2, 2014 |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook has been successful and more socially impactful than many other social media sites. David Kirkpatrick, technology journalist and author of ''The Facebook Effect'', believes that Facebook is structured in a way that is not easily replaceable. He challenges users to consider how difficult it would be to move all the relationships and photos to an alternative. Facebook has let people participate in an atmosphere with the "over the backyard fence quality" of a small town, despite the move to larger cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/facebook-effect-social-network-changed-world-122656206.html |title=Facebook Effect: How the Social Network Changed the World |date=May 18, 2012 |work=Yahoo Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per [[Pew Research Center]] survey, 44 percent of the overall US population gets news through Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/facebook-extends-lead-as-news-gateway-study/articleshow/52456528.cms |title=Facebook extends lead as news gateway: Study – The Economic Times |website=The Economic Times|access-date=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prevalent causes of envy include posts by friends about family happiness and images of physical beauty—such envious feelings leave people lonely and dissatisfied with their own lives.

In a presentation by [[California State University]] psychology professor Larry D. Rosen, he notes that teenagers using Facebook exhibit more [[narcissistic]] tendencies, while young adults show signs of antisocial behavior, [[mania]], and aggressiveness. However, he also found positive effects from Facebook use, including signs of "virtual empathy" towards online friends and helping [[introvert]]ed persons learn social skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ysolt |last=Usigan |title=Facebook makes teens narcissistic, anxious and depressed – but also nice, social and engaged |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-makes-teens-narcissistic-anxious-and-depressed-but-also-nice-social-and-engaged/ |website=[[CBS News]] |publisher=[[CBS]] |date=August 29, 2011 |accessdate=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that "While nobody can deny that Facebook has altered the landscape of social interaction, particularly among young people, we are just now starting to see solid psychological research demonstrating both the positives and the negatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Parrish |title=Facebook May Lead to Psychological Disorders in Teens |url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/Facebook-Poke-Me-Larry-D-Rosen-California-State-University-Narcissistic,news-12105.html |website=[[Tom's Hardware|Tom's Guide]] |publisher=[[Purch Group]] |date=August 8, 2011 |accessdate=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, a Facebook group called "One Million Voices Against FARC" organized an event in which hundreds of thousands of [[Colombian people|Colombians]] marched in protest against the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]], better known as the FARC (from the group's Spanish name).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=August 1, 2010 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2008/0204/p04s02-woam.html |title=Facebook used to target Colombia's FARC with global rally |work=The Christian Science Monitor |location=Boston |date=February 4, 2008 |author=Brodzinsky, Sibylla}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, one of [[North Korea]]'s official government websites and the official news agency of the country, [[Uriminzokkiri]], joined Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Roberts |title=North Korea joins Facebook |date=August 21, 2010 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7957222/North-Korea-joins-Facebook.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=August 22, 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Arab Spring]] many journalists made claims that Facebook played a major role in generating the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sutter, John D. |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/02/21/egypt.internet.revolution/index.html |title=The faces of Egypt's 'Revolution 2.0' |work=CNN |date=February 21, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hauslohner |first=Abigail |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2044142,00.html |title=Is Egypt About to Have a Facebook Revolution? |work=Time |location=New York |date=January 24, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 14, the Facebook page of "We are all khaled Said" was started by Wael Ghoniem Create Event to invite the Egyptian people to "peaceful demonstrations" on January 25. According to [[Mashable]],{{unreliable source?|date=November 2014}} in Tunisia and Egypt, Facebook became the primary tool for connecting all protesters and led the Egyptian government of Prime Minister [[Ahmed Nazif|Nazif]] to ban Facebook, Twitter and another websites on January 26&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kessler, Sarah |url=http://mashable.com/2011/01/26/facebook-blocked-in-egypt/ |title=Facebook &amp; Twitter Both Blocked in Egypt |work=Mashable |date=January 26, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; then ban all mobile and Internet connections for all of Egypt at midnight January 28. After 18 days, the uprising forced President [[Mubarak]] to resign.

In [[Bahraini uprising of 2011|Bahrain uprising]] which started on February 14, 2011, Facebook was utilized by the Bahraini regime as well as regime loyalists to identify, capture and prosecute citizens involved in the protests. A 20-year-old woman named [[Ayat Al-Qurmezi|Ayat Al Qurmezi]] was identified as a protester using Facebook, taken from her home by masked commandos and put in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facebook 'used to hunt down Bahrain dissidents' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/8681230/Facebook-used-to-hunt-down-Bahrain-dissidents.html |accessdate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As American political strategists turn their attention to the 2016 presidential contest, they identify Facebook as an increasingly important advertising tool. Recent technical innovations have made possible more advanced divisions and subdivisions of the electorate. Most important, Facebook can now deliver video ads to small, highly targeted subsets. Television, by contrast, shows the same commercials to all viewers, and so cannot be precisely tailored.&lt;ref&gt;Shane Goldmacher, "Facebook the Vote: The social network at the center of American digital life could become the epicenter of the presidential race," [http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/facebook-the-vote-20150612 ''National Journal Magazine'' June 13, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{confuse|choice of law clause}}
[[File:New_York_Supreme_Court_at_60_Centre_Street.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Forum selection clauses often gravitate towards the courts of large commercial centres, like London, New York (''pictured'') and Hong Kong.]]
{{Conflict of laws}}
A '''forum selection clause''' (sometimes called a '''dispute resolution clause''', '''choice of court clause''', '''jurisdiction clause''' or an '''[[arbitration clause]]''', depending upon its form) in a [[contract (conflict)|contract]] with a [[conflict of laws]] element allows the parties to agree that any [[litigation|disputes]] relating to that contract will be resolved in a specific forum.  They usually operate in conjunction with a [[choice of law clause]] which determines the [[Conflict_of_contract_laws#Proper_law|proper law]] of the relevant contract.

There are three principal types of clause:
* that all disputes must be litigated in a particular [[court]] in a [[jurisdiction]] agreed upon by the parties; 
* that disputes must be resolved pursuant to a [[dispute resolution]] process, such as [[mediation]], [[arbitration]], or a hearing before a [[special referee]] or expert determination; or
* the clause might refer to a combination, requiring a specific process to be carried out in a specific location, and if that process fails to resolve the issue, for litigation to be conducted in a particular court.

A simple '''forum selection clause''' covering both the proper law of the contract and the forum for resolving disputes might read:

::“This contract is governed by the laws of England and any dispute shall be finally resolved by the English courts.”

Where the clause chooses a particular jurisdiction for the resolution of disputes, it may do so either as an ''exclusive jurisdiction clause'' or a ''non-exclusive jurisdiction clause''.  An exclusive jurisdiction clause mandates that all disputes must be resolved by a particular court, whereas a non-exclusive clause confirms that a particular court may be used by the relevant parties, but does not preclude a party from commencing proceedings in another court if they wish to do so.

In many cross-border contracts, the forum for resolving disputes may not be the same as the country whose law governs the contract. And the contract may provide for a staged procedure for resolving disputes.  For example:

::“1.This agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England.
::2.The parties shall endeavour to settle any dispute that arises by direct negotiation between their managing directors or similar senior executives but if direct negotiation does not result in a resolution of the dispute, either Party may require that it be referred to mediation in accordance with the CEDR (Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution) Mediation Rules at present in force.
::3. Any dispute that is not settled by direct negotiation or by mediation shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules.”{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Discussion==
The [[choice of law]] stage in a conflict case requires the forum court to decide which of several competing [[law]]s should be applied to resolve the dispute. In this, there is an important distinction to be made between a forum selection clause and a [[choice of law clause]]. As an application of the [[public policy (law)|public policy]] of [[freedom of contract]], the parties are usually free to nominate the [[proper law]] under which all relevant disputes will be resolved. If there is an express selection, this choice will be respected so long as it is made [[bona fide]], i.e. the subjective intention prevails unless the purpose is to:
*[[evasion (law)|evade]] the operation of some mandatory provisions of a relevant law,
*there was an element of [[fraud]] or [[duress (contract law)|duress]] or [[undue influence]] involved in the signing of the contract, or
*there was some other evidence of [[mala fides]].
But, if the parties do no more than nominate a forum, this is no more than an indication that they intend that forum's law to apply. There are many reasons why parties may select a forum (see a discussion of [[forum shopping]]):
*the forum has established significant expertise in the relevant areas of law, e.g. shipping, charterparties, carriage by air, etc.;
*the standard of judicial decision making may be high:
*there may be no corruption or other outside influence to affect the fairness of the judgments;
*the [[procedure (conflict)|procedures]] may be efficient and minimise losses arising through any delay in arriving at a judgment;
*all the major witnesses may be resident within the jurisdiction making the forum convenient (see [[forum non conveniens]]); etc.
If the parties have selected a jurisdiction as the place for the resolution of a dispute, the implication is that the courts may nevertheless apply their ''lex fori'' which includes their general choice of law principles. Thus, in the ordinary course of legal events, the forum court may identify and apply a ''foreign'' law as the ''proper law''. The majority of professionally drafted contracts will address both issues, and contain clauses specifying both the forum and the law to be applied therein. The fact that the  particular contract only specifies the forum therefore becomes highly revealing as implying that the parties intended to leave the choice of law issue to the forum nominated.

Forum selection clauses have been criticised by a minority of courts as improper attempts to divest them of [[personal jurisdiction]] over the parties. Because of this, some jurisdictions refuse to give effect to these clauses, declaring them to be void as against public policy. However, most jurisdictions now recognise and enforce forum selection clauses, so long as the parties were acting in good faith.

==Effect of breach==
Although most contractual clauses are enforced by way of either an award of damages for breach or by an injunction to restrain breach, the operation of jurisdiction clauses tends to operate at the interlocutory stage of a dispute.  The existence of a jurisdiction clause in an agreement will normally operate to enable a court to take jurisdiction in a particular matter, or may provide strong grounds for another court (not the chosen court) to [[forum non conveniens|decline jurisdiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=3131cbac-071f-4d84-899f-cc703829a48c |title=Foreign judgments, foreign contracts and dangers of jurisdiction clauses |author=Cooper Grace Ward|publisher=Lexology|date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such clauses are sometimes enforced against proceedings in foreign courts by use of an [[anti-suit injunction]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example the decision of the [[United Kingdom Supreme Court]] in {{cite bailii|litigants=Ust-Kamenogorsk Hydropower Plant JSC v AES Ust-Kamenogorsk Hydropower Plant LLP|year=2013|court=UKSC|num=35}} and the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] in {{Cite bailii|litigants=[[Société Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale v Lee Kui Jak]]|year=1987|court=UKPC|num=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is theoretically possible to sue for damages for bringing proceedings in breach of a jurisdiction clause, examples are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conflictoflaws.net/2014/english-court-of-appeal-confirms-damages-award-for-breach-of-a-jurisdiction-agreement/|title=English Court of Appeal confirms Damages Award for Breach of a Jurisdiction Agreement|author=Gisele Ruehl|date=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related clauses==

In a complex agreement the forum selection clause will often be accompanied by a number of related clauses (either in the same contract or in a collateral document).  These may include:
* appointment of an agent to receive service of process in the relevant jurisdiction - this facilitates initiating process and avoids the need to make an application to court for leave to serve a defendant out of the jurisdiction
* waiver of any objection to the chosen forum - this helps to preclude or limit the ability of a litigant to apply for proceedings to be stayed or dismissed on the grounds that they have been brought in an inappropriate forum
* contractual submission to the relevant jurisdiction - this assists in any application to enforce a subsequent judgment in another state
* waiver of a right to trial by [[jury]] in the relevant forum - especially if the chosen forum is in the United States
* waiver of other procedural provisions which might apply to foreign litigants, such as the right the request they post [[security for costs]]
* waiver of any applicable [[sovereign immunity]] which a party might have the benefit of

==Clauses in void contracts==

Despite the general rule that if a contract is [[void (law)|void]] each of the individual clauses in the contract are void, numerous legal systems, including English law, provide that jurisdiction and arbitration clauses are a special case, and that such clauses may still be relied upon even when it is part of the case of the person relying upon them that the contract is void.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allenovery.com/publications/en-gb/Pages/Court-has-jurisdiction-even-when-the-underlying-contract-is-void.aspx|title=Court has jurisdiction even when the underlying contract is void|publisher=Allen &amp; Overy|date=6 November 2008|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedyslaw.com/da/casereview/pt-selecta-bestama/|title=Relying on an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a disputed contract|publisher=Kennedys|date=18 December 2015|accessdate=28 September 2017}} (Singapore)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asymmetric clauses==

Typically a forum selection clause applies to all parties to the contract.  However it is possible for a contract to state that if A wishes to sue B, then one procedure applies, and if B wishes to sue A, a different procedure applies.  The legality of asymmetric clauses differs in various legal system.  For example, they are generally enforceable under English law, but not under French law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allenovery.com/publications/en-gb/Pages/Asymmetric-jurisdiction-clauses-protected-by-Brussels-Recast-anti-torpedo-rules.aspx|title=Asymmetric jurisdiction clauses protected by Brussels Recast anti-torpedo rules|date=27 March 2017|publisher=Allen &amp; Overy|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/knowledge/publications/73098/the-validity-of-unilateral-hybrid-jurisdiction-clauses-has-become-less-certain-under-french-law|title=The validity of unilateral “hybrid jurisdiction” clauses has become less certain under French law|publisher=Norton Rose|date=|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, one party may be afforded alternative dispute resolution options.  For example, a loan agreement may provide that if the borrower wishes to bring proceedings against the lender, that can only be done by way of arbitration.  But if the lender wishes to make a claim against the borrower they may do so by way of arbitration or by proceedings in a certain court.  These are various called "option clauses", "asymmetric clauses" or "hybrid clauses".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/italy/x/231358/Arbitration+Dispute+Resolution/Italian+Supreme+Court+Considers+Unilateral+Jurisdiction+Clauses|title=Italian Supreme Court Considers Unilateral Jurisdiction Clauses|publisher=Mondaq|date=8 April 2013|author=Claudio Perrella|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The situation in the U.S.==
The [[United States Supreme Court]] has upheld forum selection clauses on several occasions, and has suggested that they should generally be enforced. See ''[[The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Company]]'', [[Case citation|407 U.S. 1]] (1972); ''[[Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute]]'', [[Case citation|499 U.S. 585]] (1991).  The ''Bremen'' and ''Carnival Cruise'' cases, however, arose under the Court's admiralty jurisdiction, not under diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. 

A court in the [[United States]] will not necessarily honor a simple '''forum selection clause''' whereas it is likely to respect a clause that points to a specific forum with the express exclusion of others. Two October 2011 appellate rulings illustrate the difference. In ''Future Industries of America v. Advanced UV Light GmbH'', 10-3928, &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/13f63218-4ec9-4232-8a21-ccd32b75d408/3/doc/10-3928_so.pdf#&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] in New York City affirmed the dismissal of a case which sent the parties to [[Germany]] because the forum selection clause made German courts the exclusive forum. By contrast, the same court in ''Global Seafood Inc. v. Bantry Bay Mussels Ltd.'', 08-1358, &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/ff01dc50-754c-4c2b-9819-2fbcc17143f8/3/doc/08-1358_opn.pdf#&lt;/ref&gt; affirmed the refusal of the lower court to refer the parties to [[Ireland]] because the clause was not exclusive, and the litigation continues in America. 

The state of New York has a statute expressly dealing with those circumstances under which a New York court may not dismiss a case on the grounds of [[forum non conveniens]] if the parties' contract provides that the agreed upon venue is a court in New York and if the transaction involved an amount not less than $1 million.

Currently, a U.S. Circuit Court split is emerging over whether forum selection clauses in a contract supersede pre-existing arbitration clauses in regulatory membership rules, such as FINRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Suskin|first1=Howard|last2=McWilliams|first2=Emily|title=Using Forum Selection Clauses to Avoid Default Arbitration Rules |url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/using-forum-selection-clauses-avoid-default-arbitration-rules|publisher=Transaction Advisors |ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific Issues===

'''Corporate Bylaws''':  Prior to 2010, it was uncommon for American corporations to insert forum selection clauses in their bylaws.  But that situation changed.  Surveying the case law in 2015,  Bonnie Roe, Daniel Tabak, and Jonathan Hofer have argued (in Lexology)&lt;ref&gt; https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1d349d33-0c85-492a-9f25-0b47632f886c &lt;/ref&gt; that forum selection bylaws have become an established part of corporate governance in only a few short years.  Their conclusion is that a board of directors adopting a forum selection bylaw "can reasonably expect" that the bylaw will be enforced. 

'''Consumer Contracts''':  The enforceability of forum selection clauses in the consumer field is controversial.  Many opponents of enforcement argue that the contracts that include such forum selection clause are contracts of “adhesion.”  This position is well summarized in an article in the Chicago-Kent Law Review by Marty Gould, who argues that, unlike most federal courts – which have enforced such clauses in the consumer context – a state court in Illinois correctly refused enforcement in connection with a claim relating to an online dating service contract.&lt;ref&gt; ''See'' Marty Gould, The Conflict Between Forum-Selection Clauses and State Consumer Protection Laws: Why Illinois Got It Right in Jane Doe v. Match.com, 90 Chi.-Kent. L. Rev. 671 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents of enforceability take issue with the assertion of “adhesion.”

'''Scope of a Forum Selection Clause''':  Courts are often required to determine whether a forum clause covers all parties (including non-signatories) to a transaction.  Many courts resolve the “scope” issue by applying the “closely related” test.  ''See'', e.g., Manetti-Farrow, Inc. v. Gucci America, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Manetti-Farrow, Inc. v. Gucci America, Inc. |vol=858 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=509 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=1988 |url=https://openjurist.org/858/f2d/509 |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; ''Roby v. Lloyd’s''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Roby v. Lloyd’s |vol=996 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=1353 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=1993 |url=https://openjurist.org/996/f2d/1353 |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in ''International Aspects of U.S. Litigation'' &lt;ref&gt; ''See'' Sherby, Eric “Forum Selection Clauses In International Commerce” in Berger, James, International Aspects of U.S. Litigation.  American Bar Association.  Pp 292-93.  {{ISBN|978-1-63425-558-5}} (hereinafter:  “Sherby”).&lt;/ref&gt;, Eric Sherby argues that most courts that have addressed the issue have glossed over the circular nature of the finding of “closely related” and that even those few judicial decisions that evince an awareness of the circularity problem have themselves fallen into the circular reasoning trap.

'''Franchise and Dealership Disputes''':  A number of American states have enacted statutes that require franchisors to agree to litigate disputes with franchisees in-state.  Those states include California, Wisconsin, and New Jersey.  Although not all of these statutes contain language of exclusivity, the case law has generally interpreted these statutes as invalidating contractual clauses that require disputes to be resolved out of the franchisee’s home state. &lt;ref&gt;  ''See'' Sherby, pp. 276-78. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed international convention==
In 2005, the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]] issued the [[Hague Choice of Court Convention]]. The Hague Convention does not apply to disputes involving consumers.

This article is about 1933 United States Federal legislation that limited the interaction of commercial and investment banking. It analyzes the content of four sections of the Banking Act of 1933, which came to be known as "Glass-Steagall," and describes the content of the legislative text and its limits/loopholes.

For broader coverage of Glass-Steagall, including its history, similar legislation, regulatory and industry reactions, and repeal, see the main article, [[Glass–Steagall Act]]. For full coverage of the 1933 Banking Act, see the main article, [[Banking Act of 1933]].

==The Glass–Steagall provisions separating commercial and investment banking==

The Glass–Steagall separation of commercial and investment banking was in four sections of the 1933 Banking Act (sections 16, 20, 21, and 32).&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{harvnb|CRS|2010a|pp=1 and 5}}.  Wilmarth 1990, p. 1161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section 16===
Section 16 prohibited national banks from purchasing or selling securities except for a customer's account (i.e., as a customer's agent) unless the securities were purchased for the bank's account as "investment securities" identified by the [[Comptroller of the Currency]] as permitted national bank investments.  Section 16 also prohibited national banks from underwriting or distributing securities.&lt;ref name="Sec 16"&gt;{{harvnb|CRS|2010a|pp=5–6}}.  Fein 2011, §4.03[A].&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 16, however, permitted national banks to buy, sell, underwrite, and distribute US government and general obligation state and local government securities.  Such securities became known as "bank-eligible securities."&lt;ref name="Sec 16"/&gt;

Section 5(c) of the 1933 Banking Act (sometimes referred to as the fifth Glass–Steagall provision) applied Section 16's rules to Federal Reserve System member state chartered banks.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmarth 2008, p. 564, fn. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section 20===
Section 20 prohibited any member bank of the Federal Reserve System (whether a state chartered or national bank) from being affiliated with a company that "engaged principally" in "the issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution" of securities.&lt;ref name="Sec 20"&gt;{{harvnb|CRS|2010a|p=6}}.  Fein 2011, §4.03[C].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section 21===
Section 21 prohibited any company or person from taking deposits if it was in the business of "issuing, underwriting, selling, or distributing" securities.&lt;ref name="Sec 21" &gt;{{harvnb|CRS|2010a|pp=6–7}}.  Fein 2011, §4.03[B].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section 32===
Section 32 prohibited any Federal Reserve System member bank from having any officer or director in common with a company "engaged primarily" in the business of "purchasing, selling, or negotiating" securities, unless the Federal Reserve Board granted an exemption.&lt;ref name="Sec 32" &gt;{{harvnb|CRS|2010a|p=7}}.  Fein 2011, §4.03[D].&lt;/ref&gt;

==1935 clarifying amendments==
Sections 16 and 21 contradicted each other.  The [[Banking Act of 1935]] "clarified" that Section 21 would not prevent a deposit taking company from engaging in any of the securities underwriting and dealing activities permitted by Section 16.  It also amended Section 16 to permit a bank to purchase stocks, not only debt securities, for a customer's account.&lt;ref&gt;Malloy 2011, § 9.02[B], pp. 9-37.  {{citation| year=1975| title=Glass–Steagall Act-A history of its legislative origins and regulatory construction (adapted from a press release of the Honorable James E. Smith, Comptroller of the Currency)| journal=Banking Law Journal| volume=37|issue=1| pages= 42–43}}.  Patrick 1993, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Banking Act of 1935]] amended Section 32 to make it consistent with Section 20 and to prevent a securities company and bank from having any employee (not only any officer) in common.  With the amendment, both Sections 20 and 32 applied to companies engaged in the "issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution" of securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kress|first=Harold James|title=The Banking Act of 1935|journal=Michigan Law Review|volume=34|issue=2|year=1935|page=180}}.  {{Citation| url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/scribd/?item_id=16279&amp;filepath=/docs/historical/ny%20circulars/1935_01582.pdf| title=Summary of certain provisions of Title I, and section-by-section summary of Title II and III, The Banking Act of 1935| page=10 (Section 307)| date=August 30, 1935| work=Circular No. 1582|publisher= Federal Reserve Bank of New York| accessdate=October 16, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prohibitions apply to dealing in and underwriting or distributing securities==
The Glass–Steagall Act was primarily directed at restricting banks and their affiliates underwriting or distributing securities.  Senator Glass, Representative Steagall, [[Ferdinand Pecora]], and others claimed banks had abused this activity to sell customers (including correspondent banks) high risk securities.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmarth 2008, p. 565.  Pecora 1939, pp. 82-104.&lt;/ref&gt; As particular "conflicts of interest," they alleged bank affiliates had underwritten corporate and foreign government bonds to repay loans made by their affiliated banks or, in the opposite direction, banks had lent to or otherwise supported corporations that used the bank's affiliate to underwrite their bonds.&lt;ref name="corpbond"&gt;Benston 1990, pp. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections 16 and 5(c) meant no member bank of the Federal Reserve System could underwrite or distribute corporate or other non-governmental bonds.&lt;ref name="Sec 16"/&gt; Sections 20 and 32 meant such a bank could not own (directly or through the same bank holding company) a company "engaged primarily in" such underwriting or other securities activities nor have any director or employee that was also a director or employee of such a company.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmarth 2008, p. 560, fn. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Glass, Representative Steagall, and others claimed banks had made too many loans for securities speculation and too many direct bank investments in securities.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmarth 2008, p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt; As described in the article on the [[Banking Act of 1933#Regulation of "specultation"|Banking Act of 1933]], non-"Glass–Steagall" provisions of the 1933 Banking Act restricted those activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|FRBNY|1933}} pp. 1 (Section 3(a)), 4 (Section 7), 8 (Section 11(a)).  Rodkey 1934, p. 893.  Willis 1935, pp. 705-711.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Glass–Steagall provisions, Sections 16 and 5(c) prevented a Federal Reserve member bank from investing in equity securities&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CRS|2010a|p=5}}.  Fein 2011, § 4.03[A], pp. 4-8 to 4-9&lt;/ref&gt; or from "dealing" in debt securities as a [[market maker]] or otherwise.&lt;ref name="dealer"&gt;Fein 2011, § 7.06[A], p. 7-90.  {{harvnb|CRS|2010a|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 16 permitted national banks (and Section 5(c) permitted state member banks) to purchase for their own accounts "marketable" debt securities that were "investment securities" approved by the [[Comptroller of the Currency]].  The Comptroller interpreted this to mean marketable securities rated "investment grade" by the [[rating agencies]] or, if not rated, a security that is the "credit equivalent."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CRS|2010a|pp=5–6}}.  Fein 2011, § 7.02[A], pp. 7-7 to 7-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before Glass–Steagall, however, national banks had been prohibited from investing in equity securities and could only purchase as investments debt securities approved by the Comptroller.  Section 16's major change was (through the Comptroller's interpretation) to limit the investments to "investment grade" debt and to repeal the [[McFadden Act]] permission for national banks to act as "dealers" in buying and selling debt securities.  Section 5(c) applied these national bank restrictions to state chartered banks that were members of the Federal Reserve System.&lt;ref&gt;Peach 1941, pp. 38-43.  Malloy 2011, § 9.02[A], p. 9-21.  {{harvnb|CRS|2010a|pp=3 and 5–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Comptroller ruled national banks could "trade" investment securities they had purchased, based on a bank's power to sell its assets, so long as this trading did not cause the bank to be a "dealer". Section 16 itself required banks to purchase only "marketable" securities, so that it contemplated (and required) that the securities be traded in a liquid market.  The Office of the Comptroller, like the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], distinguished between a "trader" and a "dealer". A "trader" buys and sells securities "opportunistically" based on when it thinks prices are low or high.  A "dealer" buys and sells securities with customers to provide "liquidity" or otherwise provides buy and sell prices "on a continuous basis" as a [[market maker]] or otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Fein 2011, § 4.04[C], pp. 4-29 to 4-30 and § 7.06[A], pp. 7-90 to 7-91.  Capatides 1992, VI. F. "Securities Trading Activities Pursuant to Investment Powers," pp. 200-204.&lt;/ref&gt; The Comptroller of the Currency, therefore, ruled that Section 16 permitted national banks to engage in "[[proprietary trading]]" of "investment securities" for which it could not act as a "dealer".&lt;ref name="proptrade"&gt;Fein 2011, § 4.04[C], p. 4-30 and § 7.06[A], pp. 7-90 to 7-91.  Capatides 1992, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Glass–Steagall permitted "banks to invest in and trade securities to a significant extent" and did not restrict trading by bank affiliates, although the Bank Holding Company Act did restrict investments by bank affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;Fein 2011, § 7.01 INTRODUCTION, p. 7-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

None of these prohibitions applied to "bank-eligible securities" (i.e., US government and state general obligation securities).  Banks were free to underwrite, distribute, and deal in such securities.&lt;ref name="Sec 16" /&gt;

==Glass–Steagall "loopholes"==

===Except for Section 21, Glass–Steagall only covered Federal Reserve member commercial banks===
As explained in the article on the [[Banking Act of 1933#Creation of FDIC and federal deposit insurance|Banking Act of 1933]], if the 1933 Banking Act had not been amended, it would have required all federally insured banks to become members of the Federal Reserve System.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|FDIC|1983}}, chapter 3, pp. 44 and 47-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, because that requirement was removed through later legislation, the United States retained a dual banking system in which a large number of state chartered banks remained outside the Federal Reserve System.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmarth 1990, p. 1137.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant they were also outside the restrictions of Sections 16, 20, and 32 of the Glass–Steagall Act.&lt;ref name="dual"/&gt; As described below, this became important in the 1980s when commentators worried large commercial banks would leave the Federal Reserve System to avoid Glass–Steagall's affiliation restrictions.&lt;ref name="threat"/&gt;

Although Section 21 of the Glass–Steagall Act was directed at preventing securities firms (particularly traditional private partnerships such as [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]]) from accepting deposits, it prevented any firm that accepted deposits from underwriting or dealing in securities (other than "bank-eligible securities" after the 1935 Banking Act's "clarification").  This meant Section 21, unlike the rest of Glass–Steagall, applied to savings and loans and other "thrifts," state nonmember banks, and any other firm or individual in the business of taking deposits.&lt;ref name="Sec 21" /&gt; This prevented such "[[depository institution]]s" from being securities firms.  It did not prevent securities firms, such as [[Merrill Lynch]], from owning separate subsidiaries that were thrifts or state chartered, non-Federal Reserve member banks.&lt;ref name="SL"&gt;Eaton 1995, pp. 1202-1207.  Benston 1990, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; As described below, this became important when securities firms used "unitary thrifts" and "nonbank banks" to avoid both Glass–Steagall affiliation restrictions and holding company laws that generally limited bank holding companies to banking businesses&lt;ref name="BHCA" /&gt; and savings and loan holding companies to thrift businesses.&lt;ref name="unitarythrift" /&gt;

===Different treatment of bank and affiliate activities===
Section 21 was not the only Glass–Steagall provision that treated differently what a company could do directly and what it could do through a subsidiary or other affiliate.  As described in the [[Banking Act of 1933]] article, Senator Glass and other proponents of separating commercial banks from investment banking attacked the artificiality of distinguishing between banks and their securities affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins 1971, pp. 503-504 and 517-522.  Peach 1941, pp. 66-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Sections 20&lt;ref name="Sec 20" /&gt; and 32&lt;ref name="Sec 32" /&gt; of the Glass–Steagall Act, however, distinguished between what a bank could do directly and what an affiliated company could do.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|FRB|1987}}, p. 475 ("Congress drew a clear distinction between member banks and their affiliates in the Glass–Steagall Act.")  Benston 1990, pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

No bank covered by Section 16's prohibitions could buy, sell, underwrite, or distribute any security except as specifically permitted by Section 16.&lt;ref name="Sec 16" /&gt; Under Section 21, no securities firm (understood as a firm "in the business" of underwriting, distributing, or dealing in securities) could accept any deposit.&lt;ref name="Sec 21" /&gt;

Glass–Steagall's affiliation provisions did not contain such absolute prohibitions.  Section 20 only prohibited a bank from affiliating with a firm "engaged principally" in underwriting, distributing, or dealing in securities.&lt;ref name="Sec 20" /&gt;  Under Section 32, a bank could not share employees or directors with a company "primarily engaged" in underwriting, distributing, or dealing in securities.&lt;ref name="Sec 32" /&gt;

This difference (which would later be termed a "loophole") provided the justification for the "long demise of Glass–Steagall" through regulatory actions that largely negated the practical significance of Sections 20 and 32 before they were repealed by the GLBA.&lt;ref name="Frontline" /&gt; The fact Sections 16, 20, and 32 only restricted Federal Reserve member banks was another feature that made the Glass–Steagall Act less than "comprehensive" and, in the words of a 1987 commentator, provided "opportunities for banking institutions and their lawyers to explore (or, perhaps more accurately, to exploit)."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Norton| first=Joseph Jude | title =Up Against "The Wall": Glass–Steagall and the Dilemma of a Deregulated ("Reregulated") Banking Environment | journal =The Business Lawyer| volume = 42| issue =February| year = 1987| page= 328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4417">The '''International Society for Labour and Social Security Law''' is an international association whose purpose is to study [[Labour law|labour]] and social security law at the national and international level, to promote the exchange of ideas and information from a comparative perspective, and to encourage collaboration among academics, lawyers, and other experts within the fields of labour and social security law.

Founded in 1958, the ISLSSL is composed of national affiliates whose members are scholars, union and management lawyers, judges, government officials, arbitrators, industrial relations and human resources specialists, and others interested in promoting international exchange of ideas and information and in developing collaboration among experts in the fields of labor, employment and employee benefits law.

The current members of the Executive Committee are Steven L. Willborn (Chair), George Nicolau, Vice-Chair, and Alvin L. Goldman, Secretary-Treasurer.

For many of those active in issues in the workplace, the internationalization of labor law and relations is becoming a reality.  To highlight just a few areas in this field of growing attention to the global legal landscape, those in academia work on issues of comparative labor and employment law, union lawyers consider international aspects of comprehensive corporate campaigns in support of the objectives of their clients, and management attorneys are increasingly called upon to give advice on the international ramifications of the employment policies of their employer clients. 

==World Congress==
The ISLSSL conducts a World Congress every three years and Regional Congresses (open to registrants from all regions) during the interim years. These meetings allow members both to combine travel with expanded understanding of how labor and employment law operate elsewhere and explain their system to others. ISLSSL conferences also facilitate development of new personal contacts and promote important scholarship, education and training in the fields of comparative and international labor law, employment law, and related fields. 

In recent years, ISLSSL World Congresses were convened in Jerusalem in 2000, in Montevideo in 2003, in Paris in 2006, in Sydney, Australia in 2009 and in Santiago, Chile in 2012. A World Congress will be hosted in Cape Town, South Africa in 2015. 

==Regional branches==
The ISLSSL maintains several regional branches. Recent Western Hemisphere Regional Congresses have been held in Lima, Peru; Querétaro, Mexico; and in the Dominican Republic. Recent Asian Regional Congresses were hosted in Manilla and Taipai, and recent European Regional Congresses were held in Stockholm, Bologna, Sevilla (2011) and Dublin (2014). In addition, the U.S. Branch sponsored a one day conferences in Chicago in May 2005 and in Philadelphia in 2012.

==Publications==
The U.S. Branch of the ISLSSL and the [[University of Illinois]] College of Law publish ''The Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal'', a quarterly law journal which publishes articles in the field of comparative and transnational labor and employment law. The journal publishes comparative analysis articles on labor law, employment policy, labor economics, worker migration, and social security issues. Many articles focus on legal systems in developing countries or post-colonial nations with emerging or new legal systems. The target audience for the journal is academics, practicing attorneys, policy makers, students, workers and labor movement officials and activists. The journal's stated policy is to make the publication readable and of practical value to officials in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cllpj.law.illinois.edu/ ''Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11768">The term '''[[judicial review]]''' is not expressly used in [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi law]], but Article 102 of the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] allows writ petitions to be filed at the [[High Court Division]] for reviewing the actions of public authorities, or suspending proceedings in lower courts. The article has caused significant [[judicial activism]] in Bangladesh. In the 1970s, Article 102 was employed by the courts to set a precedent for invalidating detentions under the Special Powers Act. The courts have struck down constitutional amendments and enforced democratic local government under Article 102. The scope of such judicial review has expanded greatly since Justice [[Mustafa Kamal (judge)|Mustafa Kamal]] formally accepted public interest litigation for the first time in 1996, allowing associations and [[NGO]]s espousing the public's cause to file for judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/a-man-of-judicial-excellence-60758|title=A man of judicial excellence|date=2015-01-20|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers under Article 102==
Article 102 of the Bangladeshi constitution gives discretionary powers to the High Court Division to issue orders. These include court orders (stay orders, quashing orders, mandatory orders, prohibiting orders), injunctions, declarations and damages. The text of Article 102 is quoted in the following.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/sections_detail.php?id=367&amp;sections_id=24659|title=Powers of High Court Division to issue certain orders and directions, etc.|last=|first=|date=|website=bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
*(1) The High Court Division on the application of any person aggrieved, may give such directions or orders to any person or authority, including any person performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic, as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of this Constitution.

*(2) The High Court Division may, if satisfied that no other equally efficacious remedy is provided by law –

*(a) on the application of any person aggrieved, make an order-
*(i)	directing a person performing any functions in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of a local authority, to refrain from doing that which he is not permitted by law to do or to do that which he is required by law to do ; or

*(ii)	declaring that any act done or proceeding taken by a person performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of a local authority, has been done or taken without lawful authority and is of no legal effect ; or

*(b) on the application of any person, make an order-

*(i) directing that a person in custody be brought before it so that it may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner ; or

*(ii) requiring a person holding or purporting to hold a public office to show under what authority he claims to hold that office.

*(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in the forgoing clauses, the High Court Division shall have no power under this article to pass any interim or other order in relation to any law to which article 47 applies.

*(4) Whereon an application made under clause (1) or sub-clause (a) of clause (2), an interim order is prayed for and such interim order is likely to have the effect of-

*(a)	prejudicing or interfering with any measure designed to implement any development programme, or any development work ; or

*(b)	being otherwise harmful to the public interest, the High Court Division shall not make an interim order unless the Attorney-General has heen given reasonable notice of the application and he (or an advocate authorised by him in that behalf) has been given an opportunity of being heard, and the High Court Division is satisfied that the interim order would not have the effect referred to in sub-clause (a) or sub-caluse (b).

*(5) In this article, unless the context otherwise requires, “person” includes a statutory public authority and any court or tribunal, other than a court or tribunal established under a law relating to the defence services of Bangladesh or any disciplined force or a tribunal to which article 117 applies.

==Lower courts==
The High Court often issues stay orders on the proceedings of lower courts, if it finds cases to be politically motivated or against judicial conscience. It can also issue a quashing order to end the proceedings. 

==Constitutional review==
Article 102 has been applied in enforcing [[fundamental rights in Bangladesh|fundamental rights]], the [[separation of power]]s, declaring [[martial law]] illegal and quashing constitutional amendments. In ''Kudrat-E-Elahi Panir and others v. Government of Bangladesh'',&lt;ref name="Panday2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pranab Panday|title=Reforming Urban Governance in Bangladesh: The City Corporation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a70HDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114|date=26 January 2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-49598-9|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the court struck down an Ordinance ending democratic representation in [[Upazila Parishad]]s and vesting all powers with the government. It reinforced that [[local government]] must include elected representatives, as set forth in the constitution.&lt;ref name="Hoque2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ridwanul Hoque|title=Judicial Activism in Bangladesh: A Golden Mean Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g_4qBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34|date=18 January 2011|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-2822-2|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/law/2005/01/02/index.htm|title=Law and Our Rights|website=www.thedailystar.net|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its judgement, the court ruled that constitutional amendments fall under the purview of judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;http://bdjls.org/introduction-judicial-review-bangladesh/&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Secretary, Ministry of Finance v Masdar Hossain]]'', the court curbed the government's power in judicial appointments and ordered for the creation of the [[Bangladesh Judicial Service Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailystar.net/independence-of-the-judiciary-the-masdar-case-14760&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Bangladesh Italian Marble Works Ltd. v. Government of Bangladesh]]'', the court ruled against military rule and martial law, while at the same time restoring some secularist clauses of the original 1972 constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/images/5thammendment.pdf|title=In the Supreme Court of Bangladesh|last=|first=|date=|website=The Daily Star|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017, the sixteenth amendment to the Bangladeshi constitution was scrapped by the supreme court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/editorial/16th-amendment-scrapped-1427797|title=16th Amendment scrapped|date=2017-07-04|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/court/2017/07/03/sc-16th-constitutional-amendment-illegal/|title=16th Amendment scrapped, parliament loses power to impeach SC judges {{!}} Dhaka Tribune|website=www.dhakatribune.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative review==
{{See also|Legitimate expectation in Bangladeshi law}}

In ''[[Aruna Sen v. Government of Bangladesh]]'', the court set a precedent for nullifying detentions under the [[Special Powers Act, 1974]]. In ''[[Abdul Latif Mirza v. Government of Bangladesh]]'', it asserted that [[natural justice]] was a well-established part of Bangladeshi law. Unlike [[Malaysia]] and [[Sri Lanka]], where ''subjective satisfaction'' has been sufficient for detention orders, the Bangladeshi apex court has asserted that there must be an ''objective'' basis to detention without trial.&lt;ref name="Omar1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Imtiaz Omar|title=Rights, Emergencies, and Judicial Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v_PIX6WBZgcC&amp;pg=PA311|date=24 April 1996|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-411-0229-9|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladeshi courts have adopted the doctrine of [[legitimate expectation]] developed in Britain and used in other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]]. The doctrine seeks to prevent abuse of power and irrationality, and assert principles of natural justice and fairness. In ''[[Biman]] v. Rabia Bashri Irene'', the court ruled that a state-owned corporation cannot discriminate against one set of employees while providing more opportunities to another set of employees, while both sets are promised with the same legitimate expectations. In ''Md. Shamsul Huda and others v. Bangladesh'', the court ruled against the government for not consulting the Chief Justice, as was the practice for thirty years, on the appointment of ten additional judges. In ''Bangladesh Soy-Protein Project Ltd v. Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief'', the court ruled that the government was wrong to discontinue a school feeding program, when there was legitimate expectation not only from the contractual party, but millions of malnourished children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culaw.ac.bd/jurnal_pdf/9743683E-93D4-4F31-A5D4-C9CED6B2D7B7.PDF|title=Doctrine of Legitimate Expectation in Administrative Law : A Bangladesh Perspective|last=Nigar|first=Meher|date=|website=The Chittagong University Journal of Law|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public interest litigation==
Public interest litigation was formally accepted in 1996 in ''Mohiuddin Farooque v. Government of Bangladesh''. The petitioner, who was the Secretary General of the [[Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association]], asked the court to instruct the government to enforce environmental policies in [[Tangail District]], where industries were risking flood control. While accepting the petition, Justice Mustafa Kamal commented that “when a public injury or public wrong or an infraction of a fundamental right affecting an indeterminate number of people is involved, any member of the public, being a citizen, or an indigenous association, espousing the public cause, has the right to invoke the Court's jurisdiction”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/a-man-of-judicial-excellence-60758|title=A man of judicial excellence|date=2015-01-20|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled that the [[Stranded Pakistani]] community be given [[Bangladeshi nationality law|citizenship]], the right to [[vote]] and National ID cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/afr/news/latest/2015/2/54ec22869/bangladesh-court-ruling-changed-lives-300000-stateless-people.html|title=How a Bangladesh court ruling changed the lives of more than 300,000 stateless people|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|work=UNHCR|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Md. Abdul Hakim v. Government of Bangladesh'', a case involving a [[madrasa]], the court explored the possibility of private bodies coming under the purview of judicial review. The madrasa's managing committee, however, was approved by the government. Hence, the particular private body was linked to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/law-our-rights/stretching-the-scope-judicial-review-1252186|title=Stretching the scope of judicial review|date=2016-07-12|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Justino de Azcárate y Flórez''' (23 August 1903 – 17 May 1989) was a Spanish lawyer and politician.
He came from a wealthy family with a tradition of involvement in politics, and had republican but not left-wing opinions.
He was a deputy in the [[Second Spanish Republic]], an exile in Venezuela for 38 years after the [[Spanish Civil War]], and then a Senator in Spain after the return to democracy. 
He played a significant role in easing the transition back to democracy.

==Origins==

Justino de Azcárate Flores was born in [[León, Spain]], on 26 June 1903.{{sfn|Areilza|1989}}
He was from a prominent liberal intellectual family of León.
His family was Basque in origin, but an ancestor who was an official in the King's Treasury had settled in León in 1690.
His grandfather, Patricio de Azcárate, was governor of several provinces, translated the complete works of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and also translated works of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].
His uncle was [[Gumersindo de Azcárate]], a scholar, lawyer and Republican deputy of León for thirty years, head of the Republican-Socialist minority until shortly before his death in 1917.
His father made his career in the army.{{sfn|Vicent|1981|p=13}}
Justino's older brother [[Pablo de Azcárate]] (1890–1971) became a deputy of León and then ambassador to the United Kingdom during the Second Spanish Republic.{{sfn|Vicent|1981|p=14}}

Justino de Azcárate was brought up in a prosperous household and was educated in English, and then at the German school for five years.
After this he went to the [[Residencia de Estudiantes]] in [[Madrid]] where he finished the baccalaureate, and then began to study Law.
After graduating he was assistant to Adolfo González Posada&lt;sup&gt;([[:es:Adolfo González Posada|es]])&lt;/sup&gt; at the university.
He was deeply involved in the movement to overthrow the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]].
He knew socialists such as [[Julián Besteiro]] and [[Fernando de los Ríos]], but was not a socialist himself.
He became secretary to the group of intellectuals Al Servicio de la República&lt;sup&gt;([[:es:Agrupación al Servicio de la República|es]])&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfn|Vicent|1981|p=14}}
Fernando de los Ríos came to hide in his house after the repression that followed the [[Jaca uprising]] of 12 December 1930.
It was in his house that [[Francisco Largo Caballero]] and the others decided to surrender to the government and go to jail.{{sfn|Vicent|1981|p=14}}

==Second Spanish Republic==

At the start of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931 Azcárate was elected Deputy of León, following the family tradition.{{sfn|Vicent|1981|p=14}}
At the age of 29 he was appointed Undersecretary of Justice to the Socialist Minister Fernando de los Ríos in the Republican Coalition government.{{sfn|Jauregui|1984}}
He remained a member of Al Servicio de la República until it was dissolved in September 1932, then joined the National Republican Party&lt;sup&gt;([[:es:Partido Nacional Republicano (Segunda República Española)|es]])&lt;/sup&gt; when it was formed under the leadership of [[Felipe Sánchez-Román]].
His party did not join the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] because it included Communists.{{sfn|Vicent|1981|p=14}}

At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War Azcárate was appointed Minister of State in the Government of [[Diego Martínez Barrio]] on the night of 18-19 July 1936.
He did not take office since when the appointment was made he was near León, a city that immediately fell into the hands of the rebels.{{sfn|Arenas Dorado}}
Azcárate  was on his family property in Villimer, near León, and went into hiding.{{sfn|Vicent|1981|p=14}}
He and his brother-in-law José Entrecanales Ibarra&lt;sup&gt;([[:es:José Entrecanales Ibarra|es]])&lt;/sup&gt; were arrested  few days later in [[Burgos]], and he was taken to the [[Valladolid]] prison, at first under the protection of General Mola.{{sfn|Vicent|1981|p=14}}
He was released from captivity in October 1937 when he was involved in a prisoner swap with [[Raimundo Fernández-Cuesta]].{{sfn|Rees|1990|p=124}}
After his release he worked in France for a rapprochement between the two sides through the Paris-based Paz Civil de España movement.
He helped arrange exchanges, pardons and commutations of death sentences.{{sfn|Vicent|1981|p=14}}

==Exile==

After the war Azcárate spent almost forty years in exile in Venezuela.{{sfn|Vicent|1981|p=14}}
He started a family in Venezuela, and by 1984 had 14 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.{{sfn|Jauregui|1984}}
In Venezuela he was an economic adviser at the highest level of government, and director of the Mendoza Foundation.{{sfn|Justino de Azcárate, nuevo presidente del Patronato ...}}
The foundation was established in 1951 by [[Eugenio Mendoza]].
Azcárate and his fellow-exile [[Pedro Grases]] were among Mendoza's direct collaborators.{{sfn|Pérez|Lluch|2016|p=62}}
He collaborated with Mendoza between 1946 and 1977.
He began travelling to Spain in the 1960s with the financial support of the Banco Urquijo&lt;sup&gt;([[:es:Banco Urquijo|es]])&lt;/sup&gt;, a Spanish private investment bank and industrial group.{{sfn|Pérez|Lluch|2016|p=65}}
In Spain he encourage corporate philanthropy and introduced new ideas about philanthropy to the artistic and cultural elite.
He put the emerging Spanish private foundation movement in contact with Medoza and other leading philanthropists in Latin America and the USA.{{sfn|Pérez|Lluch|2016|p=65}}
In 1973 Azcárate helped [[José Lino Vaamonde]] to prepare an account of the work done by the team to protect the Spanish artistic heritage during the civil war.{{sfn|Donación Joselino Vaamonde Horcada|p=2}}

==Return to Spain==

On 15 June 1977 Azcárate had just arrived at his office in the Fundación Mendoza in Caracas when he received a call from King Juan Carlos I, who asked him to accept an appointment as a ''senador real'' (Royal Senator).{{sfn|Vicent|1981|p=13}}
When he finally returned the newspapers greeting the news as a sign that things were returning to normal.{{sfn|Jauregui|1984}}
He was a senator in the Independent parliamentary group from 21 July 1977 to 2 January 1979.{{sfn|Detalle grupo parlamentario : Constituinte}}
After his return to Spain Azcárate played an important role in the transition to democracy.
Although a republican, he at once grasped the important role that the monarchy would play in reconciling the supporters of both sides in the civil war.{{sfn|Areilza|1989}}
Azcarate introduced a measure, passed by a wide margin, that called for repatriation of the physical remains of King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] and of [[Manuel Azaña]], first president of the republic, and for the return to the Spanish people of [[Pablo Picasso]]'s painting ''[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]'', then being held by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City.{{sfn|Martin|2012|p=220}}
After his term as Royal Senator was over he joined the [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|Union of the Democratic Centre]] (UCD) and was elected to the [[Cortes Generales]] as senator for León on 1 March 1979.
He was a member of the legislature from 1 March 1979 to 31 August 1982.{{sfn|Azcárate Flórez, Justino – Senate}}

Soon after his return to Spain Azcárate was elected President of the Asociación de Defensa del Patrimonio Hispania Nostra (Our Spain Association for Protection of Heritage).{{sfn|Justino de Azcárate, nuevo presidente del Patronato ...}}
He was president of the Francisco Giner de los Ríos Foundation.{{sfn|Areilza|1989}}
During the 1980s Azcárate played a key role in formalizing contacts between the Centro de Fundaciones de España, created in 1977 and the Latin American equivalents.{{sfn|Pérez|Lluch|2016|p=70}}
In September 1982 he was elected president of the ''patronato'' of the [[Museo del Prado]].{{sfn|Justino de Azcárate, nuevo presidente del Patronato ...}}
In November 1984 he was elected to the executive committee of the [[Democratic Reformist Party]] (PRD) in the constituent congress arranged by [[Miquel Roca]].{{sfn|Jauregui|1984}}
Justino de Azcárate Flores died on 17 May 1989 in Caracas, Venezuela, aged 85.{{sfn|Areilza|1989}}
His nephew [[Manuel Azcárate]] was a Spanish journalist, politician and a leader of the [[Communist Party of Spain]] (Partido Comunista de España, PCE) in the 1960s and 1970s.

'''Legal management''' (also offered as: legal studies, or paralegal studies) is an [[academic]] and  [[professional]] discipline that is a hybrid between the study of [[law]] and [[management]] (i.e. business administration, public administration, etc.). It is generally considered as the best preparatory law program for those who aspire to become members of a [[Bar (law)|bar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BS Legal Management|url=http://www.finduniversity.ph/majors/bs-in-legal-management-philippines/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, alumni of legal management programmes pursue a [[professional degree]] in law such as [[Juris Doctor]] (JD) or [[Bachelor of Laws]] (Ll.B.) while some profess as [[paralegals]], law clerks, political analysts, politicians, public administrators, entrepreneurs, business executives, or pursue careers in the [[academe]].

The degree was designed in the [[Philippines]] and was first introduced in [[Ateneo de Manila University]] in the 1980s by former [[Philippine Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice]] [[Renato Corona]]. It is also offered in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalparalegal.edu/Bachelors.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; most notably, at the [[University of California Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;http://legalstudies.berkeley.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal management student organisations across the Philippines are represented by the Alliance of Legal Management Associations of the Philippines (ALMAP) to the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], as a [[non-stock]], [[non-profit]], student-run corporation. Timothy Caday is the national president of ALMAP for the academic year 2017-2018.

==Curriculum==
Legal management is currently offered in multiple degree formats depending on the offering [[college]] or [[university]]. Its variety and flexibility is a focal point among schools that have it in their roster of [[academic degrees]]. Some capitalise in the [[legal]] aspects, while others for the [[business]] aspects. Some schools may offer the degree either as a predominantly preparatory law programme, a [[liberal arts]] focused programme, or a business and [[management]] programme. Core subjects include: [[law]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]] and [[management]] (public and business). Depending on the school, the ratio of law courses to management courses vary between 40:60 to 90:10. Graduate degrees in the discipline are offered in multiple colleges and universities in the United States.

Variations of the discipline can be conferred either as the following undergraduate degrees:
* [[Bachelor of Science]] in Legal Management (BSc Legal Management)
* [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Legal Management (AB Legal Management)
* [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Legal Studies (AB Legal Studies)

[[Image:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.png|thumb|upright|Shamash (seated), depicted as handing symbols of authority to [[Hammurabi]] (relief on the upper part of the stele of [[code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi's code of laws]])]]

In [[law]], "legitimacy" is distinguished from "[[legality]]" (see also [[color of law]]). An action can be legal but not legitimate or vice versa it can be legitimate but not legal.

Thomas Hilbink suggests that the [[Power (social and political)|power]] to compel obedience to the law, is derived from the power to sway [[public opinion]], to the belief that the [[law]] and its agents are legitimate and deserving of this [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]].&lt;ref name="Hilbink"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hilbink|first1=Thomas|title=The Power of Legitimacy in Obedience to the Law (Introduction to Legal Studies (Legal 250-2) UMass Amherst, Spring 2007 (Hilbink) March 6, 2007)|url=http://www.umass.edu/legal/Hilbink/250/S07%20model2.pdf|website=www.umass.edu/|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where as Tyler says, 'Legitimacy is ...a [[Psychology|psychological]] property of an [[authority]], institution, or social arrangement, that leads
those connected to it to believe that it is appropriate, proper, and [[Justice|just]]’ (Tyler, 2006b: 375). Thus viewed, the legal legitimacy is the belief that the [[law]] and agents of the law are rightful holders of [[authority]]; that they have
the right to dictate appropriate behaviour and are entitled to be obeyed; and that laws should be obeyed, simply because, that is the right thing to do (Tyler, 2006a; Tyler, 2006b; cf. Easton, 1965).&lt;ref name="BJC Jonathan Jackson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Jonathan|last2=Bradford|first2=Ben|last3=Hough|first3=Mike|last4=Myhill|first4=Andy|last5=Quinton|first5=Paul|last6=Tyler|first6=Tom|title=Why Do People Comply with the Law? Legitimacy and the Influence of Legal Institutions|journal=British Journal of Criminology,|date=13 March 2013|volume= 52,|issue= 6,|pages= 1051–1071, 2012|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1994490|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of legal legitimacy==
Peter Kropotkin suggests that, Acceptance to [[rule of law]] developed in response to the rampant abuse of authority by the nobility; post advent of the middle class after the French Revolution,  strict adherence to the law was conceived as the ultimate equalizer within society. “Whatever this law might be,” Kropotkin writes, “it promised to affect lord and peasant alike; it proclaimed the equality of rich and poor before the judge”.&lt;ref name="Hilbink" /&gt;

To establish that a government action can be legal whilst not being legitimate; e.g., the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]], which allowed the United States to wage war against Vietnam without a formal declaration of war. It is also possible for a government action to be legitimate without being legal; e.g., a pre-emptive war, a [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)|military junta]]. An example of such matters arises when legitimate institutions clash in a [[constitutional crisis]].

Legitimacy is the [[right to rule]] and the recognition by the ruled of that right (Sternberger, 1968; Beetham,
1991; Coicaud, 2002; Tyler, 2006a; Bottoms and Tankebe, in press). Social institutions need legitimacy if
they are to develop, operate, and reproduce themselves effectively (Easton, 1965). This is as true for the
police as it is for other institutions of [[government]]. But peculiar to the police function is the statesponsored
use of violence and force, the resolution of conflict, and the enforcement of legally-prescribed
[[Behavior|conduct]] and rule-following (Banton, 1964; Bittner, 1970; Reiner, 2010). [[Police legitimacy]] and [[Consent|public consent]] are necessary conditions of the justifiable use of state power: those who are subject to policing
must see the police as right and proper (Tyler, 2006b, 2011a; Schulolfer et al., in press).&lt;ref name="BJC Jonathan Jackson" /&gt;

By linking legitimacy to [[Regulatory compliance|public compliance]], Tyler’s work generates a psychology of authorization
and consent. The legitimacy of the police and the law leads to a respect for legal guidelines for action that dictates appropriate and personally binding behaviour. These guidelines may not be perfectly aligned with
everyone’s moral system. We do not always agree with the moral force of each and every law. But
legitimacy involves the public recognition that the [[social order]] needs a [[system of laws]] that generate
compliance and respect above and beyond individual preferences (or disagreements) with specific laws.
When people believe it is morally just to obey the law, so long as they know that a particular act is illegal,
then the immorality of illegal behaviour becomes a given. A different sort of morality ‘kicks in.’
Naturally, there are other reasons why individuals do (or do not) comply with the law (Bottoms,
2001).

==Limitations==
According to Lawrence Solum, since legitimacy has different shades of meaning and is undertheorized, it is very easy to make claims about legitimacy that are ambiguous or theoretically unsound so one needs to be extra care full before deploying the idea of legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Solum"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solum|first1=Lawrence|title=Legal Theory Lexicon: Legitimacy (January 25, 2010)|url=http://lsolum.typepad.com/legaltheory/2010/01/legal-theory-lexicon-legitimacy.html|website=Legal Theory Lexicon|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legitimacy and legal socialisation==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
Compliance may be related in large part to habitual or routinized behaviours and orientations. If one complies with the law because such compliance is ‘ingrained in everyday life’ (Robinson and McNeill, 2008: 436), it is unlikely that one will perceive breaking the law as an option when confronted with a situation which, objectively at least, offers such an opportunity. Equally, there will be those who are deterred by the presence of formal or informal mechanisms of social control. Genetic and psychological factors may be an influence; community context and effects might also be important; all these and other notions have been brought to bear on attempts to explain why people commit crime.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31137">The '''[[Stop Online Piracy Act]]''' ('''SOPA''') and the '''[[PROTECT IP Act]]''' ('''PIPA''') are two proposed draft laws that are being considered by the [[United States Congress]]. Their stated goals are to increase the ability of U.S. law enforcement to fight online trafficking in [[copyright]]ed [[intellectual property]] and counterfeit goods, and give the U.S. government and copyright holders additional tools to curb access to "rogue websites dedicated to infringing or counterfeit goods", especially those registered outside the United States.&lt;ref name=CNet&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20062398-281.html|title=Senate bill amounts to death penalty for Web sites|date=May 12, 2011 |work=CNet|accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the laws argue that they are needed to protect the [[intellectual property]] of owners of content. Opponents of the laws argue that they endanger [[free speech]] and free expression by harmfully regulating the internet.

==Opponents of SOPA/PIPA==

===Representatives opposed to SOPA/PIPA===
In December 2011, Representative [[Ron Paul]] spoke out against SOPA, deriding it as a bill that would "take over the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrV3SoHR3IE&amp;t=2s Ron Paul, December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Paul thus became the first major presidential candidate to publicly oppose the SOPA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/31/2673136/ron-paul-blasts-sopa Ron Paul Blasts SOPA]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14612">The following is a list of the 21 largest civil settlements, reached between the [[United States Department of Justice]] and [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] from 2001 to 2017, ordered by the size of the total civil settlement. Some of these matters also resolved criminal fines and penalties, listed in parentheses, but these amounts are not considered when ranking these settlements as some of the settlements listed did not have a criminal component. Thus, this article provides the most accurate list of the largest civil-only portion of settlements between pharmaceutical companies and the Department of Justice. Because this article focuses on civil portions of settlements, some of the larger total settlements do not make the list.  For example, Purdue Pharmaceuticals entered an agreement with the United States, pleading guilty to felony misbranding of OxyContin with intent to defraud and mislead under sections 33 1(a) and 333(a)(2) of the FD&amp;C Act and agreed to pay more than $600 million, but only $160 million was allocated to resolve civil claims under the False Claims Act, while the remainder was allocated to resolve criminal claims and private claims.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1223&amp;context=jhclp&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal claims against the pharmaceutical industry have varied widely over the past two decades, including [[Medicare fraud|Medicare and Medicaid fraud]] driven by [[Off-label use|off-label]] promotion, and inadequate manufacturing practices.&lt;ref&gt;Almashat, S ''et al''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17362">A '''truth commission''' or '''[[truth and reconciliation commission]]''' is a commission tasked with discovering and revealing past wrongdoing by a government (or, depending on the circumstances, [[non-state actor]]s also), in the hope of resolving conflict left over from the past. They are, under various names, occasionally set up by states emerging from periods of internal unrest, [[civil war]], or [[dictatorship]].

==List by country==
; Algeria:The [[Commission of Inquiry in Algeria|Ad Hoc Inquiry Commission in Charge of the Question of Disappearances]] formed in 2003 to investigate human rights violations that occurred in the 1990s.
; Argentina: Created by [[President of Argentina]] [[Raúl Alfonsín]] on 15 December 1983, the [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] (''Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas'') investigated human rights violations, including 30,000 [[forced disappearance]]s, committed during the [[Dirty War]]. The research of the commission, documented in the Never Again (''Nunca Más'') report, included individual cases on 9,000 disappeared persons. The report was delivered to Alfonsín on 20 September 1984 and opened the door to the [[Trial of the Juntas]], the first major trial held for war crimes since the [[Nuremberg trials]] in Germany following World War II and the first to be conducted by a civilian court.
; Bangladesh: [[War Crimes Fact Finding Committee]], set up in Bangladesh to investigate the [[Human rights|Human rights abuses]] carried out during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].&lt;ref name=Rahman&gt;{{cite book|last=Rahman|first=Syedur|title=Historical dictionary of Bangladesh|year=2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8108-6766-6|pages=289|edition=4th|author2=Craig Baxter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Brazil: The non-punitive [[National Truth Commission]] (''Comissão Nacional da Verdade'') was approved in late 2011 by the [[Federal Senate]] and sanctioned by President [[Dilma Rousseff]]. The commission will last for two years and consist of seven members appointed by the President. Members of the commission will have access to all government files about the 1946–1988 period and may convene victims or people accused of violations for testimony, although it will not be mandatory for them to attend. After the end of the two years period, the commission will issue a report with its findings. The group will not have, however, the obligation to disclose everything they discover.
; Canada: The [[Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] was a commission investigating the human rights abuses in the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]]. It ran from June 2008 through June 2015.
; Chad: formed a [[Truth Commission (Chad)|Commission of Inquiry into Crimes and Misappropriations committed by former president Hissene Habre]] in 1990 which reported there had been 40,000 killings and 200,000 cases of torture under Habre's rule.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

; Congo (Democratic Republic): A peace agreement in 2004 mandated the [[Truth and Reconciliation commission DRC|Truth and Reconciliation Commission (DRC)]] which issued an administrative report in 2007.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
; Chile: The [[Rettig Report|National Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (''Comisión Nacional de Verdad y Reconciliación;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=12618 | title=Dto-355 09-May-1990 Ministerio del Interior, Subsecretaria del Interior| date=1990-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; popularly known as the "Rettig Report"), created in April 1990, investigated deaths and disappearances, particularly for political reasons, under [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s rule. The report was released in 1991. The [[Valech Report|National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture]] ("Valech Report") also investigated human rights abuses from the reign of Pinochet. Released in 2004 and 2005, the commission differed from the previous one in that it investigated non-fatal violations of human rights, such as torture, and also covered children whose parents had disappeared or been killed. The report of this commission was used by the government of Chile to give out pensions and other benefits to survivors.
; Czech Republic: The [[Office for the Documentation and the Investigation of the Crimes of Communism]] (''Úřad dokumentace a vyšetřování zločinů komunismu'') is a subdivision of Czech criminal police which investigates criminal acts from the period 1948-1989 which were unsolvable for political reasons during the Czechoslovak communist regime.
; Ecuador: [[La Comisión de la Verdad|The Truth Commission]] (''La Comisión de la Verdad'') was established by the government to investigate the violation of human rights especially during the period of 1984 to 1988.
; El Salvador: Established by the [[United Nations]] (instead of the Government of El Salvador),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/salvador/informes/truth.html Derechos.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the establishment of the [[Commission on the Truth for El Salvador]] (''Comisión de la Verdad para El Salvador'') was part of [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]] to end the [[Salvadoran Civil War]]. The commission investigated murders and executions committed during the war, including that of [[Óscar Romero]] in 1980 and [[murder of UCA scholars|six Jesuits]] in 1989.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6649">'''Marc Toberoff''' is an [[intellectual property]] attorney specializing in [[copyright]] and entertainment litigation.

He is known for representing the estates of Superman’s co-creators, [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]], in ongoing litigation with [[Warner Bros.]] and [[DC Comics]] over the original copyrights to ''[[Superman]]''.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117983184?refCatId=13|title=Warner vexed by legal Man of Steel &amp;#124; Variety|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit has become a seminal case regarding the Copyright Act’s termination provisions, which permit authors and their estates to recover their copyrights after lengthy time periods. In 2008, Toberoff secured a favorable ruling in the U. S. District Court for the Central District of California. (“After seventy years, Jerome Siegel's heirs regain what he granted so long ago-the copyright in the Superman material that was published in Action Comics, Vol. 1.”).&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/business/media/29comics.html?_r=0|title=The New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegel v. Warner Bros. Entm't Inc., 542 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1145 (C.D. Cal. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, after a part of that decision was reversed on appeal, final judgment was entered upholding the heirs’ termination as to Siegel and Shuster’s original Superman story and other early works.

Toberoff also represents the estate of comic book artist and creator [[Jack Kirby]] in litigation with [[Marvel Entertainment]] regarding the copyrights to Kirby’s co-creations, including ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', ''[[X-Men]]'', ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'', ''[[Mighty Thor]]'' and ''[[Silver Surfer]]''.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/business/21marvel.html|title=The New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/uncategorized/jack-kirby-the-forgotten-hero-in-marvels-grand-hollywood-adventure/|title=Jack Kirby, the abandoned hero of Marvel&amp;#8217;s grand Hollywood adventure, and his family&amp;#8217;s quest &amp;#91;updated&amp;#93; &amp;#124; Hero Complex &amp;#8211; movies, comics, pop culture &amp;#8211; Los Angeles Times|publisher=herocomplex.latimes.com|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A petition for [[certiorari]] to the U.S. Supreme Court is currently pending.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-deadline-com.vimg.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/KIRBY-HEIRS-SCOTUS-PETITION-MARVEL-DISNEY-WM__140403023608.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the music industry, Toberoff represents, among others, the children of [[Ray Charles]]. On their behalf, Toberoff prevailed in a suit in the Central District of California regarding the copyrights to fifty-one of his songs, including many of his most famous compositions (e.g., ''[[I Got A Woman]]'', ''It’s All Right'', ''[[Hallelujah I Love Her So]]'').&lt;ref name="billboard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/1535910/court-rules-for-ray-charles-children-in-copyright|title=Court Rules For Ray Charles Children In Copyright Lawsuit (Updated) &amp;#124; Billboard|publisher=billboard.com|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ray Charles Foundation, Inc. v. Raenee Robinson et al., 919 F.Supp.2d 1054 (C.D.

Toberoff also represents most of the children of [[James Brown]] regarding his copyrights.

In 2008, Toberoff persuaded the Ninth Circuit to affirm the copyrights of the daughter of [[Eric Knight]] in his novel ''[[Lassie Come-Home]]'', a case that has helped shape authors’ rights under the Copyright Act.&lt;ref&gt;Classic Media, Inc. v.

'''Marriageable age''' (or '''marriage age''') is the minimum age at which a person is allowed by law to [[marriage|marry]], either as a right or subject to parental, judicial or other forms of approval. Age and other prerequisites to marriage vary between jurisdictions, but marriage age is often set at 16. Until recently, the marriageable age for women was lower in many jurisdictions than for men, but in many places has now been raised to those of men. Most jurisdictions allow marriage at a younger age with parental or judicial approval, and some also allow younger people to marry if the female is pregnant. The marriage age should not be confused with the [[Age of majority|age of maturity]] or the [[age of consent]], though in some places they may be the same. In many developing countries, the official age prescriptions stand as mere guidelines. In some societies, a marriage by a person below the age of 21 is regarded as a [[child marriage]].

The 55 parties to the 1962 [[Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage, and Registration of Marriages]] have agreed to specify a minimum marriage age by statute law‚ to override customary, religious, and tribal laws. When the marriageable age under a [[religious law|law of a religious community]] is lower than that under the [[law of the land]], the [[law|state law]] prevails. However, some religious communities do not accept the supremacy of state law in this respect, which may lead to child marriage or forced marriage. The 123 parties to the 1956 [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery]] have agreed to adopt a minimum age for marriage.

==History and social attitudes==

===Ancient history===
Historically, the age of consent for a sexual union was determined by tribal custom, or was a matter for families to decide. In most cases, this coincided with signs of puberty: such as [[menstruation]] for a girl and pubic hair for a boy.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/childhood/A-Ar/Age-of-Consent.html | title=Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society|publisher=Faqs.org|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish oral tradition, men cannot consent to marriage until they reach the age of majority of 13 years and one day and have undergone puberty. With no signs of puberty, they are considered minors until the age of twenty. After twenty, they are not considered adults if they show signs of impotence. If they show no signs of puberty or do show impotence, they automatically become adults by age 35 and can marry. The same rules apply to women, except their age of majority is 12 years and a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10861-minority|title=MAJORITY - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10888-mi-un|title=MI'UN - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient Rome, it was very common for girls to marry and have children shortly after the onset of puberty. Roman law required brides to be at least 12 years old.&lt;ref name="Morolli2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Danilo Ceccarelli Morolli|title=A brief outline of roman law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVEjYPaeuTgC&amp;pg=PA53|date=2012-12-07|publisher=Gangemi Editore spa|isbn=978-88-492-7509-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman law, first marriages to brides from 12 to 24 required the consent of the bride and her father; by the late antique period, Roman law permitted women over 25 to marry without parental consent.&lt;ref&gt;Anti Arjava, ''Women and Law in Late Antiquity'' Oxford, 1996, pp. 29–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic [[canon law]] followed the Roman law. In the 12th century, the Catholic Church drastically changed legal standards for marital consent by allowing daughters over 12 and sons over 14 to marry without their parents' approval, even if their marriage was made clandestinely.&lt;ref&gt;John Noonan, "The Power to Choose" '' Viator'' 4 (1973) 419–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Parish studies have confirmed that late medieval women did sometimes marry without their parents' approval.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sheehan, "The formation and stability of marriage in fourteenth century England" ''Medieval Studies'' 33 (1971) 228–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western European marriage pattern|western Europe]], the rise of [[Christianity]] and [[manorialism]] had both created incentives to keep families [[nuclear family|nuclear]], and thus the age of marriage increased; the [[Western Christianity|Western Church]] instituted marriage laws and practices that undermined large kinship groups. The Church prohibited [[consanguineous]] marriages, a marriage pattern that had been a means to maintain [[clan]]s (and thus their power) throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Bouchard, Constance B., 'Consanguinity and Noble Marriages in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries', ''Speculum'', Vol. 56, No. 2 (Apr., 1981), pp. 269-70&lt;/ref&gt; The church also forbade marriages in which the bride did not clearly agree to the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greif, Avner |title=Family Structure, Institutions, and Growth: The Origin and Implications of Western Corporatism |publisher=Stanford University |date=December 4, 2011 |pages=2–3 |url=http://www.aeaweb.org/assa/2006/0106_0800_1104.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904002714/https://www.aeaweb.org/assa/2006/0106_0800_1104.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-classical history===
After the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]], manorialism also helped weaken the ties of kinship and thus the power of [[clan]]s; as early as the 9th century in [[Austrasia|northwestern France]], families that worked on [[manor]]s were small, consisting of parents and children and occasionally a grandparent. The Church and State had become allies in erasing the solidarity and thus the political power of the clans; the Church sought to replace [[paganism|traditional religion]], whose vehicle was the kin group, and substitute the authority of the [[old age|elder]]s of the kin group with that of a religious elder; at the same time, the king's rule was undermined by revolts by the most powerful kin groups, clans or sections, whose conspiracies and murders threatened the power of the state and also the demands by manorial lords for obedient, compliant workers.&lt;ref&gt;Heather, Peter. 1999. ''The Visigoths from the Migration Period to the Seventh Century: An Ethnographic Perspective''. Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd. Pgs 142-148&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[peasant]]s and [[serf]]s lived and worked on farms that they rented from the lord of the manor, they also needed the permission of the lord to marry. Couples therefore had to comply with the lord of the manor and wait until a small farm became available before they could marry and thus produce children; those who could and did delay marriage were presumably rewarded by the landlord and those who did not were presumably denied that reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2012/02/06/medieval-manoralism-and-the-hajnal-line/|title=medieval manoralism and the hajnal line|work=Hbdchick.wordpress.com|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, marriage ages in [[Medieval England]] varied depending on economic circumstances, with couples delaying marriage until their early twenties when times were bad, but might marry in their late teens after the [[Black Death]], when there was a severe labour shortage;&lt;ref&gt;Hanawalt, Barbara A. 1986. The Ties That Bound: Peasant Families in Medieval England Oxford University Press, Inc. Pg 96&lt;/ref&gt; by appearances, marriage of adolescents was not the norm in England.&lt;ref&gt;Hanawalt, p. 98-100&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval [[Eastern Europe]], on the other hand, the [[Slavs|Slavic]] traditions of [[patrilocality]] of early and universal marriage (usually of a bride aged 12–15 years, with [[menarche]] occurring on average at 14) lingered;&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Eve. 1995. ''Sex and Society in the World of the Orthodox Slavs, 900-1700''. Cornell University Press. pgs 96-98&lt;/ref&gt; the manorial system had yet to penetrate into eastern Europe and had generally had less effect on clan systems there; and the bans on [[cross-cousin]] marriages had not been firmly enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Mitterauer, Michael. 2010. ''Why Europe?: The Medieval Origins of Its Special Path''. University of Chicago Press. Pg. 45-48, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded age-of-consent law dates back 800 years. In 1275, in England, as part of the rape law, the [[Statute of Westminster 1275]], made it a misdemeanour to "ravish" a "maiden within age", whether with or without her consent. The phrase "within age" was interpreted by jurist Sir Edward Coke as meaning the age of marriage, which at the time was 12 years.&lt;ref name="Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230 |title=Children and Youth in History &amp;#124; Age of Consent Laws |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, the jurist [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], an influential founder of [[Canon law]] in medieval Europe, accepted the age of puberty for marriage to be between 12 and 14, but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if the children were older than&amp;nbsp;7. Some authorities claimed that consent could take place earlier. Marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty, and the marriage had not already been consummated. Gratian noted that "If one over the age of seven takes a prepubescent wife of less than seven and transfers her to his house, such a contract gives rise to the impediment of public propriety".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |first=John |last=Noonan |date=1967 |website=CUA.edu |title=MARRIAGE CANONS from THE DECRETUM OF GRATIAN - BOOK FOUR - TITLE I - Betrothals and Marriages - C3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117042750/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |archivedate=2016-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, there are recorded marriages of 2 and 3 year olds: in 1564, a three year old named John was married to a two year old named Jane in the Bishop's Court in Chester, England&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"/&gt;

===Modern history===
The policy of the Roman Catholic Church, and later various protestant churches, of considering clandestine marriages and marriages made without parental consent to be valid was controversial, and in the 16th century both the French monarchy and the Lutheran Church sought to end these practices, with limited success.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Gottlieb, ''The family in the Western World from the Black Death to the Industrial Age'' Oxford, 1993, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1929, Scots law followed Roman law in allowing a girl to marry at twelve years of age and a boy at fourteen, without any requirement for parental consent. However, marriage in Scotland at such young ages was in practice almost unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/getting-married-in-scotland/minimum-age-for-marriage-in-Scotland|title=National Records of Scotland|first=National Records of Scotland Web|last=Team|website=www.nrscotland.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England and Wales, the [[Marriage Act 1753]] required a marriage to be covered by a licence (requiring parental consent for those under 21) or the publication of banns (which parents of those under 21 could forbid).

In most of [[Western European marriage pattern|Northwestern Europe]], marriage at very early ages was rare. One thousand marriage certificates from 1619 to 1660 in the Archdiocese of [[Canterbury]] show that only one bride was 13 years old, four were 15, twelve were 16, and seventeen were 17 years old; while the other 966 brides were at least 19 years old.&lt;ref name="Laslett, Peter 1965. p 82"&gt;Laslett, Peter. 1965. The World We Have Lost. New York, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. p 82&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Church dictated that both the bride and groom must be at least 21 years of age to marry without the consent of their families; in the certificates, the most common age for the brides is 22 years. For the grooms 24 years was the most common age, with average ages of 24 years for the brides and 27 for the grooms.&lt;ref name="Laslett, Peter 1965. p 82"/&gt; While European noblewomen often married early, they were a small minority of the population,&lt;ref&gt;Coontz, Stephanie. 2005. Marriage, a History: From Obedience to Intimacy, or How Love Conquered Marriage. New York, New York: Viking Press, Penguin Group Inc. p 125-129.&lt;/ref&gt; and the marriage certificates from Canterbury show that even among nobility it was very rare to marry women off at very early ages.&lt;ref name="Laslett, Peter 1965. p 82"/&gt;

The American colonies followed the English tradition, but the law was more of a guide. For example, Mary Hathaway (Virginia, 1689) was only 9 when she was married to William Williams. Sir Edward Coke (England, 17th century) made it clear that "the marriage of girls under 12 was normal, and the age at which a girl who was a wife was eligible for a dower from her husband's estate was 9 even though her husband be only four years old".&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"/&gt; Reliable data for when people would actually marry are very difficult to find. In England, for example, the only reliable data on age at marriage in the early modern period come from records relating only to those who left property after their death. Not only were the records relatively rare, but not all bothered to record the participants' ages, and it seems that the more complete the records are, the more likely they are to reveal young marriages, giving a biased sample. Additionally, 20th- and 21st-century historians have sometimes shown reluctance to accept data regarding a young age of marriage, and would instead explain the data away as a misreading by a later copier of the records.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"/&gt;

In France, until the [[French Revolution]], the marriageable age was 12 years for girls and 14 for boys. Revolutionary legislation in 1792 increased the age to 13 years for girls and 15 for boys. Under the [[Napoleonic Code]] in 1804, the marriageable age was set at 15 years for girls and 18 for boys.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 144 of the Civil Code&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the marriageable age for women was increased to 18, the same as for men.

In jurisdictions where the ages are not the same, the marriageable age for girls is more commonly two or three years lower than that for boys.

==Marriageable age as a right vs exceptions==
In the majority of countries the marriageable age ''as a right'' is 18. However, most of these countries have exceptions for minors, usually requiring parental or judicial authorization. These exceptions vary considerably by country. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] stated the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/MarryingTooYoung.pdf |format=PDF |title=Marrying Too Young : UNFPA Report |publisher=Unfpa.org |accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In 2010, 158 countries reported that 18 years was the minimum legal age for marriage for women without parental consent or approval by a pertinent authority. However, in 146 countries, state or customary law allows girls younger than 18 to marry with the consent of parents or other authorities; in 52 countries, girls under age 15 can marry with parental consent. In contrast, 18 is the legal age for marriage without consent among males in 180 countries. Additionally, in 105 countries, boys can marry with the consent of a parent or a pertinent authority, and in 23 countries, boys under age 15 can marry with parental consent.}}

In recent years, many countries in the EU have tightened their marriage laws, either banning marriage under 18 completely, or requiring judicial approval for such marriages. Countries which have reformed their marriage laws in recent years include Sweden (2014), Denmark (2017), Germany (2017), Luxembourg (2014), Spain (2015). Many developing countries have also enacted similar laws in recent years: Honduras (2017), Ecuador (2015), Costa Rica (2017), Panama (2015), Trinidad &amp; Tobago (2017), Malawi (2017). In the US, the lax child marriage laws that exist in many states have attracted international attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-41727495/why-does-the-us-have-so-many-child-brides|title=Why does US have so many child brides?|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western countries, marriages of teenagers have become rare in recent years, with their frequency having rapidly declined during the past few decades. For instance, in Finland, where underage youth can obtain a special judicial authorization to marry, there are only 30–40 such marriages per year in the early 21st century (with most of the spouses being aged 17), while in the early 1990s, more than 100 underage marriages were registered each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/12986-un-urges-finland-to-prohibit-child-marriage.html|title=UN urges Finland to prohibit child marriage|author=Aleksi Teivainen|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to the age of majority==
{{See|Age of majority|Minor (law)}}
The marriage age ''as a right'' is usually the same with the [[age of majority]] which is 18 in most countries. However, in some countries the age of majority is under 18, while in others it is 19, 20 or 21. In Canada for example, the age of majority is 19 in [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[British Columbia]], 
[[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Yukon]] and  [[Nunavut]], and marriage under 19 in these provinces requires parental or court consent (see [[Marriage in Canada]]). In many jurisdictions, by marriage minors become  [[Emancipation of minors|legally emancipated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://family.findlaw.com/emancipation-of-minors/automatic-emancipation-of-minors.html|title=Automatic Emancipation of Minors - FindLaw|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The marriageable age ''as a right'' is 18 in all European countries, with the exception of [[Andorra]] and [[Scotland]] where it is 16 (for both sexes). Existing ''exceptions'' to this general rule (usually requiring special judicial or parental consent) are discussed below. In both the [[European Union]] and the [[Council of Europe]] the marriageable age falls within the jurisdiction of individual member states. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul convention]], the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women and domestic violence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Convention of Belem do Para and the Istanbul Convention : A response to violence against women worldwide |publisher=Oas.org |accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; only requires countries which ratify it to prohibit [[forced marriage]] (Article 37) and to ensure that forced marriages can be easily voided without further victimization (Article 32), but does not make any reference to a minimum age of marriage.

The permission by the Ordinary is also required in case of a marriage of a minor child (i.e. under 18 years old) when his parents are unaware of his marriage or if his parents reasonably oppose his marriage (can. 1071 § 1 no. 6).

===Islam===
In Quran, the "age of marriage" coincides with puberty. Classical Islamic law (Sharia) does not have a marriageable age because there is no minimum age at which puberty can occur. In Islam there is no set age for marriage, the condition is physical (bulugh) maturity and mental (rushd) maturity. So the age is variable. The Islamic Prophet Muhammad, who is said to serve as a role model (al-uswatu'l-hasana) for every Muslim, is reported by Sunni [[Hadith]] sources to have married Aisha when she was six or seven years old, with the marriage [[consummate]]d when she was nine years old (or according to some sources ten years old) and he was 54 years old.&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;{{harvnb|Watt|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spellberg40/&gt;&lt;ref name=armstrong157/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child marriage: a silent health and human rights issue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barlas|2002|pp=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Büchler and Schlater observe that ''"marriageable age according to classical Islamic law coincides with the occurrence of puberty. The notion of puberty refers to signs of physical maturity such as the emission of semen or the onset of menstruation"'', but then claim the schools of Islamic jurisprudence ([[madhaahib]]) set the following marriageable ages for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/78204/1/Beitrag_Buechler_Schlatter_final.pdf |title=Marriage Age in Islamic and Contemporary Muslim Family Laws: A Comparative Survey |last1=Büchler |first1=Andrea |last2=Schlatter |first2=Christina |journal=Electronic Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Law |volume=1 |issn=1664-5707 |date=2013 |publisher=University of Zurich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However other sources give different ages.

The [[Reliance of the Traveller]], frequently considered the definitive summary of Shafi'i jurisprudence, states in the chapter on marriage as follows:

::''32.2a. A father arranging the marriage of a virgin daughter: A father can arrange the marriage of his virgin daughter without her permission even if she is beyond the age of puberty. It is up to him whether he consults her or not.''
::''32.2b. Someone other than the father arranging the marriage of a virgin: However, if anyone other than the father is arranging the marriage of a virgin, such as a guardian appointed in the father's will or anyone else, he cannot give her in marriage unless she is beyond the age of puberty and has given her consent. In this case her silence is taken as consent.''&lt;ref&gt;Reliance of the Traveller, by Shihabuddin Abu al-'Abbas Ahmad ibn an-Naqib al-Misri, translated by Nuh Ha Mim Keller, republished by Amana 1994, {{ISBN|0-9638342-0-7}}; Chapter M, part 32.2&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Shaf'i jurisprudence is contradicted by hadith from Bukhari which states that a marriage is impossible without the consent of the girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/163990|title=Her father forced her to get married; is this marriage valid and what is the ruling on intercourse in this case? - islamqa.info|website=islamqa.info|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to proposed Saudi marriage reforms in 2009, it was observed that ''"although girls can marry even before reaching puberty, they cannot terminate the wedding contracts according to the Hanbali legal school, one of four major schools in Sunni Islam, which gives complete control over the female to the male guardian"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/saudi-push-to-end-child-marriages-1.541430|title=Saudi push to end child marriages|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
The [[Manu Smriti]] recommends arranged marriages for girls before they are 12 years old.&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu/manu09.htm |website=www.sacred-texts.com |accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If unmarried for 3 years after 12 years old (At 15 years old), the damsel (virgin woman) may marry on her own will somebody from her own caste and rank by freewill.&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"/&gt;  Bhishma states a similar thing in Anushasana Prava of the Mahabharata. If the girl is unmarried for 3 years after the appearance of puberty (after 12 years and 8 months), then in the 4th year (at 16) she is to look for a husband herself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b009.htm |website=www.sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manu Smriti states that a 30 year old man is to marry a 12 year old maiden (virgin woman) or a 24 year old man is to marry an 8 year old girl (child) if the duties of the man would be impeded.&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"/&gt;  In Anushasana Prava of the Mahabharata, Bhishma states, a 30 year old person is to marry a 10 year old girl or a 21 year old person is to marry a 7 year old girl.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

'''Mayfair Ltd v Pears''' [1987] 1 NZLR 459 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding whether or not strict liability applies in tort.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Brian Pears parked his car on a parking deck of a Wellington building, without the permission of the buildings owner, Mayfair Limited, effectively trespassing. Later that night, for unknown reasons, the car mysteriously exploded, starting a fire in the building, causing $8,475.81 in damage to the building.

Pears refused to pay for the damage.

==Held==
The court ruled that whilst there was strict liability in tort for the escape of fire, the court limited this to cases where the escape of fire was from land or buildings. Here the escape of fire was merely from a chattel (a car), meaning there was no strict liability for the resulting damage, and as the fire was not attributed to any negligence on his part, Mayfair's claim was struck out.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="839">A '''migrant levy''' is a fee imposed on an immigrant by their receiving country. 

There are pros and cons of having a migrant levy. It generates revenue for the government of the host country. However, it serves as a burden to immigrants. It serves as a barrier on immigration.

The [[International Labour Organization]] describes migrant levies in the following way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Some governments of labour-receiving countries earn sizeable revenues through levies on firms employing foreign workers, the burden of which may partly or fully be passed on to the workers themselves. Malaysia and Singapore are examples of countries using selective levies."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/documents/publication/wcms_160632.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Model National Statute for the Promotion of Tolerance''' is a document prepared by a group of experts of the [[European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation]] (ECTR), which regulates the legal relationship in the sphere of [[Toleration|tolerance]]. It has been unanimously adopted – under the sponsorship of the ECTR – by a group of experts consisting of five scholars from different countries and from diverse backgrounds: Prof. [[Yoram Dinstein]] (Professor Emeritus of International Law and Human Rights, [[Tel Aviv University]], Israel) (Chair); Dr. [[Ugo Genesio]] (retired Judge, the Italian Supreme Court); Prof. [[Rein Mullerson]] (Rector, [[University Nord]], Tallinn, Estonia);  Prof. [[Daniel Thürer]] (Professor Emeritus of International and European Law, [[University of Zurich]], Switzerland); and Prof. [[Rüdiger Wolfrum]] (Director, [[Max Planck Institute]] for Comparative Public law and International Law, [[Heidelberg]], Germany).  

The Model Statute is designed for adoption by the respective national legislatures of European States. Its purpose is to fill a vacuum: although all European States are committed to the principle of tolerance, nowhere is this principle defined in binding legal terms. The principal challenge in preparing the Model Statute was to go beyond rhetoric and generalities, spelling out concrete and enforceable obligations that ensure tolerance and stamp out intolerance. The ECTR has presented this document in a series of meetings and seminars with international organizations, including the Council of Europe and the OSCE.  As a result there is currently a joint ECTR-European Council task force which is working on its implementation.

The document has been officially presented to public by [[European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation|ECTR]] Chairman [[Alexander Kwasniewski]] and [[European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation|ECTR]] Co-Chairman [[Viatcheslav Kantor]] on October 16, 2012 in Brussels and later has been passed to [[Martin Schulz]], [[President of the European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://moshekantor.com/en/projects/ectr/events/presentation-model-law-2012/ Presentation of the Model National Statute for the Promotion of Tolerance]&lt;/ref&gt; Talking of the need for “rules, proposals, laws” to make tolerance mandatory across the EU, Kantor introduced ECTR’s proposals for a general law of tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejpress.org/article/62428 Balkan leaders honoured for ‘tolerance, honesty, moral courage, and reconciliation’ at European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation ceremony / European Jewish Press, October 16, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120105927/http://www.ejpress.org/article/62428 |date=November 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expanding on the Model Law for Promotion of Tolerance, a version of which it seeks to make mandatory across all 27 member states, Chair of the Task Force in charge of its inception [[Yoram Dinstein]] said that “tolerance is the glue that cements together the bond between distinct groups in a single society”. “The definition of tolerance itself needs to be established”, asserted Dinstein. “Whilst current definitions of tolerance would preclude racism and religious-based bigotry, anti-Semitism must be individually stated as a separate definition”.

“Holocaust denial should be a crime,” he continued, as should “denial of any genocide which has been ruled on by an international court”.

A common point of reference was needed by member states, in order to establish the distinction between tolerance and its limitations, he added. The exceptions to tolerant thought and speech ranges from female circumcision to Burka wearing, according to the draft, which it argued provided an obstacle to crime prevention.

Another potential tolerance minefield arises from the issue of migration, he suggested. “Migrants are entitled to tolerance by society as much as anyone else, but they have a duty to integrate into their adopted society - if they’re not prepared to do so, they should be forced to leave, subject to a legal process,” he continued, adding that “integration does not mean assimilation”.

“The future of the EU is very much interconnected to migration,” interjected [[Alexander Kwasniewski|Kwasniewski]]. “We cannot support an ageing demography without migration. Tolerance would help us in coping with inevitable migration, which is the future of a multi-cultural EU.”

“A dedicated centre must be established to provide migrants with a transitional period to integrate into their adopted country,” added [[Viatcheslav Kantor|Kantor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejpress.org/article/62428 Ibid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120105927/http://www.ejpress.org/article/62428 |date=2012-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

“The EU and European governments need to stem the growing [[violent extremism]] and narrow what is acceptable on the political spectrum to strengthen the mainstream,” he said. “With this in mind the ECTR has empowered a group of eminent international jurists to create a Model European Statute for the Promotion of Tolerance.”

The Model Statute&lt;ref&gt;[http://moshekantor.com/en/docs/14/  Model National Statute for the Promotion of Tolerance]&lt;/ref&gt; consists of a legislative text with accompanying explanatory notes. The text consists of a Preamble and nine substantive Sections.

The Preamble gives full expression to the duality of diversity and solidarity in society, emphasizing that the overriding consideration is coexistence.

Section 1 deals with four definitions:  (a) "Tolerance"; (b) "Group"; (c) "Group libel"; and (d) "Hate crimes". 

Section 2 states the Purpose of the Model Statute. A list of examples of intolerance is enumerated, including "[[xenophobia]], [[anti-Semitism]], [[anti-feminism]] and [[homophobia]]".

Section 3 lists the main human rights the enjoyment of which is covered by the obligation of tolerance. 

Section 4 is the limitations clause, and in many respects it is the key provision. The explanatory notes mention many contemporary issues from terrorism to female circumcision.

Section 5 deals with migrants, one of the issues that currently are uppermost in the public mind in Europe. 

Section 6 relates to implementation. The Draft Model Statute sets up a National Tolerance Monitoring Commission – an independent body composed of eminent persons from outside the civil service – vested with the authority to serve as a watchdog.

Section 7 covers penal sanctions. 

Section 8 addresses the issue of education. The basic idea is to promote the culture of tolerance from a very early age and to go on into adult education.

Section 9, the last one, goes into the issue of the media, empowering a Press Complaints Commission – set up by the media themselves – to supervise implementation of the law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16434">The '''National Socialist Program''', also known as the '''25-point Program''' or the '''25-point Plan''' ({{Lang-de|25-Punkte-Programm}}), was the party program of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP). Originally the name of the party was the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP), but on the same day as the announced party program it was renamed the NSDAP, ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei''. [[Adolf Hitler]] announced the party's program on 24 February 1920 before approximately 2,000 people in the Munich Festival of the [[Hofbräuhaus]]. The National Socialist Program originated at a DAP congress in [[Vienna]], then was taken to [[Munich]], by the civil engineer and theoretician [[Rudolf Jung]], who having explicitly supported Hitler had been expelled from [[Czechoslovakia]] because of his political agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Leftism Revisited |first=Erik von |last=Kuehnelt-Leddihn |publisher=Regnery Gateway |location=Washington, DC |year=1990 |pages=147–149 |ref=harv |isbn=0-89526-537-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]] summarizes the program by saying that its components were "hardly new" and that "German, Austrian, and Bohemian proponents of anti-capitalist, nationalist-imperialist, anti-Semitic movements were resorted to in its compilation," but that a call to "breaking the shackles of finance capital" was added in deference to the ''[[idee fixe (psychology)|idee fixe]]'' of [[Gottfried Feder]], one of the party's founding members, and Hitler provided the militancy of the stance against the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and the insistence that the points could not be changed, and were to be the permanent foundation of the party.  Bracher characterizes the points as being "phrased like slogans; they lent themselves to the concise sensational dissemination of the 'anti' position on which the party thrived. ... Ideologically speaking, [the program] was a wooly, eclectic mixture of political, social, racist, national-imperialist wishful thinking..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Dietrich Bracher|Bracher, Karl Dietrich]] (1970) ''The German Dictatorship'', Steinberg, Jean (translator). New York: [[Penguin Books]]. p.115 {{isbn|0-14-013724-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|US Holocaust Memorial Museum]], the 25-point program "remained the party's official statement of goals, though in later years many points were ignored."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/learn/timeline-of-events/before-1933/nazi-party-platform|title=Nazi Party Platform — United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|website=www.ushmm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==German Party program==
In Munich, on 24 February 1920, Hitler publicly proclaimed the 25-point Program of the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party), when the Nazis were still known as the DAP ([[German Workers Party]]).&lt;ref&gt;Some 2000 people attended the meeting at the [[Hofbrauhaus]]; Hitler offered the program point-by-point, to an approving crowd. {{cite book  | last = Toland | first = John  | title = Adolf Hitler  | author-link=John Toland (author) |publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company |pages=94–98 |year=1976 |location=New York  | isbn = 0-385-03724-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They retained the National Socialist Program upon renaming themselves as the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] (NSDAP) in February 1920 and it remained the Party’s official program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kershaw | first = Ian | title = Hitler: A Biography | publisher = W.

Unlike the Austrians, the Germans did not claim to being either liberal or democratic and opposed neither political [[Reactionary|reaction]] nor the [[Junker|aristocracy]], yet advocated democratic institutions (i.e. the German central parliament) and voting rights solely for Germans — implying that a Nazi government would retain popular [[suffrage]].

The Austrian monarchist [[Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn]] proposed that the 25-point Program was pro-labour: "[T]he program championed the [[Right to work|right to employment]], and called for the institution of [[profit sharing]], confiscation of [[Profiteering (business)|war profits]], prosecution of usurers and profiteers, nationalization of [[Trust law|trusts]], communalization of department stores, extension of the old-age [[pension]] system, creation of a [[Public education|national education]] program of all classes, prohibition of [[child labour]], and an end to the dominance of [[Financial capital|investment capital]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Liberty or Equality |edition=Fortieth anniversary |last=Kuehnelt-Leddihn |first=Erik von |publisher=Christendom Press |location=Front Royal, VA |origyear=1952 |year=1993 |page=257 |isbn=0-931888-51-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas historian [[William I. Brustein|William Brustein]] proposes that said program points and party founder [[Anton Drexler]]’s statements indicate that the Nazi Party (NSDAP) originated as a [[working-class]] political party.&lt;ref name="Brustein 141"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Logic of Evil: The Social Origins of the Nazi Party, 1925–1933 |first=William |last=Brustein |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, CT |year=1996 |page=141 |isbn=0-300-06533-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of pursuing public office, the agrarian failures of the 1920s prompted Hitler to further explain the "true" meaning of Point 17 ([[land reform]], legal land [[Nationalization|expropriation]] for public utility, abolishment of the [[land value tax]] and proscription of land [[speculation]]), in the hope of winning the farmers' votes in the May 1928 elections. Hitler disguised the implicit contradictions of Point 17 of the National Socialist Program, by explaining that "gratuitous expropriation concerns only the creation of legal opportunities, to expropriate, if necessary, land which has been illegally acquired, or is not administered from the view-point of the national welfare. This is directed primarily against the Jewish land-speculation companies".&lt;ref&gt;http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/1708-ps.asp/&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1920s, other members of the NSDAP, seeking ideologic consistency, sought either to change or to replace the National Socialist Program. In 1924, the economist [[Gottfried Feder]] proposed a 39-point program retaining some original policies and introducing new policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henry A. |last=Turner |title=German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1985 |isbn=0-19-503492-9 |page=62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler suppressed every instance of programmatic change by refusing to broach the matters after 1925, because the National Socialist Program was “inviolable”, hence immutable.&lt;ref&gt;In February 1926, at the [[Bamberg Conference]], the dissident NSDAP faction endeavored to change the Program, but Hitler declared change intolerable, lest it be an insult to the memory of Nazi brethren killed at the [[Feldherrnhalle]] during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. Three months later, at the NSDAP’s annual general meeting, the National Socialist Program was declared immutable.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Henry Ashby Turner|Henry A. Turner]] notes that Hitler "conspicuously" omitted the text of the program from his political biography, ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1925, 1926), where he referred to it as "the so-called program of the movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henry A. |last=Turner |title=German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1985 |isbn=0-19-503492-9 |page=77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]] writes that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;To [Hitler, the program] was little more than an effective, persuasive propaganda weapon for mobilizing and manipulating the masses.  Once it had brought him to power, it became pure decoration: 'unalterable', yet unrealized in its demands for nationalization and expropriation, for land reform and 'breaking the shackles of finance capital'.  Yet it nonetheless fulfilled its role as backdrop and pseudo-theory, against which the future dictator could unfold his rhetorical and dramatic talents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Dietrich Bracher|Bracher, Karl Dietrich]] (1970) ''The German Dictatorship'', Steinberg, Jean (translator). New York: [[Penguin Books]]. p.116 {{isbn|0-14-013724-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The 25-point Program of the NSDAP===
# We demand the unification of all Germans in the [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]] on the basis of the people's [[right to self-determination]].
# We demand equality of rights for the [[German people]] in respect to the other [[nations]]; abrogation of the [[peace treaties]] of [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] and [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|St. Germain]].
# We demand land and territory ([[colonies]]) for the sustenance of our people and colonization for our surplus population.
# Only a member of the race can be a [[citizen]]. A member of the race can only be one who is of German blood, without consideration of [[creed]]. Consequently, no [[Jew]] can be a member of the race.
# Whoever has no citizenship is to be able to live in Germany only as a guest and must be under the authority of [[legislation]] for [[alien (law)|foreigners]].
# The right to determine matters concerning [[administration (law)|administration]] and [[law]] belongs only to the citizen. Therefore, we demand that every [[public office]], of any sort whatsoever, whether in the [[Reich]], the [[county]] or [[municipality]], be filled only by citizens. We combat the corrupting [[parliamentary]] economy, office-holding only according to party inclinations without consideration of character or abilities.
# We demand that the [[State (polity)|state]] be charged first with providing the opportunity for a [[livelihood]] and way of life for the citizens. If it is impossible to sustain the total population of the State, then the members of foreign nations (non-citizens) are to be expelled from the Reich.
# Any further [[immigration]] of non-citizens is to be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans, who have immigrated to Germany since 2 August 1914, be forced immediately to leave the Reich.
# All citizens must have equal rights and obligations.
# The first [[obligation]] of every citizen must be to productively work mentally or physically. The activity of individuals is not to counteract the interests of the universality, but must have its result within the framework of the whole for the benefit of all. Consequently, we demand:
# Abolition of [[unearned income|unearned (work and labour) incomes]]. Breaking of debt (interest)-slavery.
# In consideration of the monstrous sacrifice in property and blood that each [[war]] demands of the people, personal enrichment through a war must be designated as a [[crime]] against the people. Therefore, we demand the total [[confiscation]] of all [[War profiteering|war profits]].
# We demand the [[nationalisation]] of all (previous) associated industries ([[Trust (monopoly)|trusts]]).
# We demand a division of [[Profit (economics)|profits]] of all [[heavy industries]].
# We demand an expansion on a large scale of [[pension|old age welfare]].
# We demand the creation of a healthy [[middle class]] and its conservation, immediate communalization of the great warehouses and their being leased at low cost to small firms, the utmost consideration of all small firms in [[contracts]] with the State, county or municipality.
# We demand a [[land reform]] suitable to our needs, provision of a law for the free [[expropriation]] of land for the purposes of public utility, abolition of [[land value tax|taxes on land]] and prevention of all [[speculation]] in land.
# We demand struggle without consideration against those whose activity is injurious to the general interest. Common national criminals, [[usury|usurers]], profiteers and so forth are to be [[capital punishment|punished with death]], without consideration of confession or race.
# We demand substitution of a German [[common law]] in place of the [[Roman Law]] serving a materialistic world-order.
# The state is to be responsible for a fundamental reconstruction of our whole national [[education]] program, to enable every capable and industrious German to obtain [[higher education]] and subsequently introduction into leading positions. The plans of instruction of all educational institutions are to conform with the experiences of practical life. The comprehension of the concept of the state must be striven for by the school [''Staatsbürgerkunde''] as early as the beginning of understanding. We demand the education at the expense of the state of outstanding intellectually [[gifted children]] of poor parents without consideration of position or profession.
# The state is to care for the elevating national health by protecting the mother and child, by outlawing [[child-labor]], by the encouragement of physical fitness, by means of the legal establishment of a gymnastic and sport obligation, by the utmost support of all organizations concerned with the physical instruction of the young.
# We demand abolition of the [[mercenary]] troops and formation of a national army.
# We demand legal opposition to known lies and their promulgation through the [[News media|press]]. In order to enable the provision of a German press, we demand, that: 
#: a. All writers and employees of the newspapers appearing in the German language be members of the race;
#: b. Non-German newspapers be required to have the express permission of the state to be published. They may not be printed in the German language;
#: c. Non-Germans are forbidden by law any financial interest in German publications or any influence on them and as punishment for violations the closing of such a publication as well as the immediate [[wikt:expulsion|expulsion]] from the Reich of the non-German concerned. Publications which are counter to the [[general good]] are to be forbidden. We demand legal [[prosecution]] of artistic and literary forms which exert a destructive influence on our national life and the closure of organizations opposing the above made demands.
# We demand [[freedom of religion]] for all [[religious denominations]] within the state so long as they do not endanger its existence or oppose the [[moral]] senses of the [[Germanic race]]. The Party as such advocates the standpoint of a [[positive Christianity]] without binding itself confessionally to any one denomination. It combats the Jewish-materialistic spirit within and around us and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our nation can only succeed from within on the framework: "The good of the community before the good of the individual".&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Heiden, ''A History of National Socialism'', 1935. Translated by Alfred A. Knopf, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; ("GEMEINNUTZ GEHT VOR EIGENNUTZ" [all caps in original])&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Miller Lane, Leila J. Rupp, introduction and translation ''Nazi Ideology Before 1933: A Documentation'', Manchester University Press (1978) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;
# For the execution of all of this we demand the formation of a strong central power in the Reich. Unlimited authority of the central parliament over the whole Reich and its organizations in general. The forming of state and profession chambers for the execution of the laws made by the Reich within the various states of the confederation. The leaders of the Party promise, if necessary by sacrificing their own lives, to support by the execution of the points set forth above without consideration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2563">A '''national intranet''' is an  [[Internet protocol]]-based [[walled garden (technology)|walled garden]] network maintained by a [[nation state]] as a national substitute for the global [[Internet]], with the aim of controlling and monitoring the communications of its inhabitants, as well as  restricting their access to outside media. Other names have been used, such as the use of the term "'''halal internet'''" in Islamic countries.

Such networks generally come with access to state-controlled media and national alternatives to foreign-run Internet services: [[search engine]]s, [[web-based email]], and so forth. Such networks can be viewed as the final endpoint of a policy of [[Internet censorship]] and [[computer surveillance]], in which the public Internet and its services are completely replaced by [[ersatz]] state-controlled alternatives.

North Korea's [[Kwangmyong (network)|Kwangmyong]] network, dating back to 2000, is the best-known of this type of network. [[Cuba]] and [[Myanmar]] also use a similar network system that is separated from the rest of the Internet.&lt;ref name=wsj28may2011&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher Rhoads and Farnaz Fassihi|date=May 28, 2011|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704889404576277391449002016|title=Iran Vows to Unplug Internet|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negligence''' (Lat. ''negligentia'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negligence|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/negligence|website=Oxford Living Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a failure to exercise appropriate and or ethical ruled care expected to be exercised amongst specified circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negligence|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/negligence|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area of [[tort]] law known as ''negligence'' involves harm caused by failing to act as a form of ''carelessness'' possibly with extenuating circumstances. The core concept of negligence is that people should exercise reasonable care in their actions, by taking account of the potential harm that they might foreseeably cause to other people or property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feinman|first=Jay|title=Law 101|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-539513-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone who suffers loss caused by another's negligence may be able to sue for [[damages]] to compensate for their harm. Such loss may include physical injury, harm to property, psychiatric illness, or economic loss. The law on negligence may be assessed in general terms according to a five-part model which includes the assessment of duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause, and damages.&lt;ref&gt;Deakin, Tort Law, 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of negligence claims==
Some things must be established by anyone who wants to sue in negligence. These are what are called the [[Element (criminal law)|"elements"]] of negligence.

Most jurisdictions say that there are four elements to a negligence action:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehm|first1=Theodore R.|title=A Tangled Webb - Reexamining the Role of Duty in Indiana Negligence Actions|journal=Indiana Law Review|date=2003|volume=37|issue=1|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/indilr37&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#duty: the [[defendant]] has a duty to others, including the [[plaintiff]], to exercise reasonable care,
#breach: the defendant breaches that duty through an act or culpable omission,
#damages: as a result of that act or omission, the plaintiff suffers an injury, and
#causation: the injury to the plaintiff is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant's act or omission.

Some jurisdictions narrow the definition down to three elements: duty, breach and proximately caused harm.&lt;ref name="owen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owen|first1=David G.|title=The Five Elements of Negligence|journal=Hofstra Law Review|date=Summer 2007|volume=35|issue=4|page=1671|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2282&amp;context=hlr|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions recognize five elements, duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause, and damages.&lt;ref name="owen"/&gt; However, at their heart, the various definitions of what constitutes negligent conduct are very similar.

===Duty of care===
{{Main|Duty of care}}
[[Image:Grapevinesnail 01.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A decomposed snail in Scotland was the humble beginning of the modern English law of negligence]]

The legal liability of a defendant to a plaintiff is based on the defendant's failure to fulfil a responsibility, recognised by law, of which the plaintiff is the intended beneficiary. The first step in determining the existence of a legally recognised responsibility is the concept of an obligation or duty. In the tort of negligence the term used is duty of care &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Torts In Ireland|last=Quill|first=Eoin|publisher=Gill &amp; Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=|location=Dublin 12|pages=19|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 532&lt;/ref&gt; [1932] established the modern law of negligence, laying the foundations of the duty of care and the [[fault (legal)|fault]] principle which, (through the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]]), have been adopted throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. May Donoghue and her friend were in a café in Paisley. The friend bought Mrs Donoghue a [[Ice cream float|ginger beer float]].  She drank some of the beer and later poured the remainder over her ice-cream and was horrified to see the decomposed remains of a snail exit the bottle. Donoghue suffered nervous shock and gastro-enteritis, but did not sue the cafe owner, instead suing the manufacturer, Stevenson. (As Mrs Donoghue had not herself bought the ginger beer, the doctrine of [[privity]] precluded a [[law of contract|contractual]] action against Stevenson).

The Scottish judge, Lord MacMillan, considered the case to fall within a new category of delict (the Scots law nearest equivalent of tort). The case proceeded to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], where [[Lord Atkin]] interpreted the biblical ordinance to 'love thy neighbour' as a legal requirement to 'not harm thy neighbour.' He then went on to define neighbour as "persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions that are called in question."

In England the more recent case of ''[[Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman]]'' [1990] introduced a 'threefold test' for a duty of care. Harm must be (1) reasonably foreseeable (2) there must be a relationship of proximity between the plaintiff and defendant and (3) it must be 'fair, just and reasonable' to impose liability. However, these act as guidelines for the courts in establishing a duty of care; much of the principle is still at the discretion of judges.

In Australia, ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' was used as a persuasive precedent in the case of ''[[Grant v Australian Knitting Mills]]'' (AKR) (1936).&lt;ref name=PC&gt;{{Cite Bailii|litigants=[[Grant v Australian Knitting Mills]] |year=1935 |court=UKPC |num=62 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1936] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 85}}; {{cite AustLII|UKPCHCA|1|1935|parallelcite= (1935) 54 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 49 |date=21 October 1935 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a landmark case in the development of negligence law in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.uwa.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/1838186/Example_Development-of-law-negligence.pdf |title=Example of the Development of the Law of Negligence |website=law.uwa.edu.au}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a duty of care is owed for psychiatric, as opposed to physical, harm was discussed in the Australian case of ''Tame v State of New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd'' (2002).&lt;ref name="Tame HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|35|2002|litigants=Tame v State of New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(2002) 211 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 317 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaensch v Coffey"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|52|1984|litigants=[[Jaensch v Coffey]] |parallelcite=(1984) 155 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 549 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Determining a duty for mental harm has now been subsumed into the ''Civil Liability Act 2002'' in New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|cla2002161|Civil Liability Act 2002|32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The application of Part 3 of the ''Civil Liability Act 2002'' (NSW) was demonstrated in ''Wicks v SRA (NSW); Sheehan v SRA (NSW)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|22|2010|litigants=Wicks v State Rail Authority of New South Wales; Sheehan v State Rail Authority of New South Wales |parallelcite=(2010) 241 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 60 |courtname=auto |date=}};&lt;br&gt;see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|15|2005|litigants=Koehler v Cerebos (Australia) Ltd |parallelcite=(2005) 222 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 44 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breach of duty===
{{See also|Breach of duty in English law}}
[[Image:Cricket Scene Sarhad..jpg|thumb|150px|right|In ''Bolton v Stone'', the English [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] were sympathetic to cricket players]]
Once it is established that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff/claimant, the matter of whether or not that duty was breached must be settled.  The test is both subjective and objective.  The defendant who knowingly (subjective,Which is totally based on observation and personal prejudice or view) exposes the plaintiff/claimant to a substantial risk of loss, breaches that duty.  The defendant who fails to realize the substantial risk of loss to the plaintiff/claimant, which any [[reasonable person]] [objective,Which is totally based on ground facts and reality without any personal prejudice or point of view.] in the same situation would clearly have realized, also breaches that duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1980|litigants=Wyong Shire Council v Shirt |parallelcite=(1980) 146 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 40 |courtname=auto |date=1 May 1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|151|2005|litigants=Doubleday v Kelly |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}; see also {{cite AustLII|NSWCA|222|2006|litigants=Drinkwater v Howart |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whether the test is objective or subjective may depend upon the particular case involved.

There is a reduced threshold for the standard of care owed by children. In the Australian case of McHale v Watson,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|13|1966|litigants=McHale  v Watson |date=7 March 1966 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; McHale, a 9-year-old girl was blinded in one eye after being hit by the ricochet of a sharp metal rod thrown by a 12-year-old boy, Watson. The defendant child was held not to have the level of care to the standard of an adult, but of a  12-year-old child with similar experience and intelligence. Kitto J explained that a child's lack of foresight is a characteristic they share with others at that stage of development.

Certain jurisdictions, also provide for breaches where professionals, such as doctors, fail to warn of risks associated with medical treatments or procedures. Doctors owe both objective and subjective duties to warn; and breach of either is sufficient to satisfy this element in a court of law. For example, the Civil Liability Act in Queensland outlines a statutory test incorporating both objective and subjective elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Qld|act|cla2003161|Civil Liability Act 2003|21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an obstetrician who fails to warn a mother of complications arising from childbirth may be held to have breached their professional duty of care.

In ''Donoghue v Stevenson'', Lord Atkin declared that "the categories of negligence are never closed"; and in ''[[Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office|Dorset Yacht v Home Office]]'' it was held that the government had no immunity from suit when they negligently failed to prevent the escape of juvenile offenders who subsequently vandalise a boatyard.  In other words, all members of society have a duty to exercise reasonable care toward others and their property.  In ''[[Bolton v. Stone]]'' (1951),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bolton v. Stone]],'' [1951] A.C. 850 see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|42|2007|litigants=Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held that a defendant was not negligent if the damage to the plaintiff were not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of his conduct. In the case, a Miss Stone was struck on the head by a cricket ball while standing outside a cricket ground. Finding that no batsman would normally be able hit a cricket ball far enough to reach a person standing as far away as was Miss Stone, the court held her claim would fail because the danger was not reasonably or sufficiently foreseeable. As stated in the opinion, 'reasonable risk' cannot be judged with the benefit of hindsight.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}  In ''[[Roe v Minister of Health]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Roe v Minister of Health]]'' (1954) 2 AER 131; see also ''Glasgow Corporation v Muir'' (1943) 2 AER 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Denning said the past should not be viewed through rose coloured spectacles, finding no negligence on the part of medical professionals accused of using contaminated medical jars, since contemporary standards would have indicated only a low possibility of medical jar contamination.

===Causation===
{{Main|Causation (law)}}

In order for liability to result from a negligent act or omission, it is necessary to prove not only that the injury was caused by that negligence, but also that there is a legally sufficient connection between the act and the negligence.

====Factual causation (actual cause)====
{{See also|Causation in English law|Breaking the chain}}

For a defendant to be held [[Legal liability|liable]], it must be shown that the particular acts or omissions were the cause of the loss or damage sustained.&lt;ref name="Tubemakers of Australia Ltd v Fernandez"&gt;''Tubemakers of Australia Ltd v Fernandez'' (1976) 10 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 303; (1976) 50 [[Australian Law Journal Reports|ALJR]] 720 [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=10+alr+303 LawCite records].&lt;/ref&gt; Although the notion sounds simple, the causation between one's breach of duty and the harm that results to another can at times be very complicated. The basic test is to ask whether the injury would have occurred 'but for', or without, the accused party's breach of the duty owed to the injured party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|48|2009|litigants=Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Bou Najem |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}; {{cite AustLII|HCA|5|2012|litigants=Strong v Woolworths |parallelcite=(2012) 246 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 182 |courtname=auto |date=}};&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="March v Stramare"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1991|litigants=March v Stramare (E &amp; MH) Pty Ltd |link=March v Stramare |parallelcite=(1991) 171 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 506 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallace v Kam"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|19|2013|litigants=Wallace v Kam |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the High Court has held that the 'but for' test is not the exclusive test of causation because it cannot address a situation where there is more than one cause of damage.&lt;ref name="March v Stramare"/&gt; When 'but for' test is not satisfied and the case is an exceptional one, a commonsense test ('Whether and Why' test) will be applied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|cla2002161|Civil Liability Act 2005|5d}}(2).&lt;/ref&gt;
Even more precisely, if a breaching party materially increases the risk of harm to another, then the breaching party can be sued to the value of harm that he caused.

Asbestos litigations which have been ongoing for decades revolve around the issue of causation. Interwoven with the simple idea of a party causing harm to another are issues on [[insurance]] bills and compensations, which sometimes drove compensating companies out of business.

====Legal causation (proximate cause)====
[[Image:Train wreck at Montparnasse 1895.jpg|thumb|150px|Negligence can lead to [[Montparnasse derailment|this sort of collision]]: a train wreck at [[Gare Montparnasse]] in 1895.]]
Sometimes factual causation is distinguished from 'legal causation' to avert the danger of defendants being exposed to, in the words of [[Benjamin Cardozo|Cardozo, J.]], "liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class."&lt;ref&gt;''Ultramares Corp. v. Touche''(1931) 255 N.Y. 170, 174 N.E. 441&lt;/ref&gt; It is said a new question arises of how remote a consequence a person's harm is from another's negligence. We say that one's negligence is 'too remote' (in England) or not a '[[proximate cause]]' (in the U.S.) of another's harm if one would 'never' reasonably foresee it happening. Note that a 'proximate cause' in U.S. terminology (to do with the chain of events between the action and the injury) should not be confused with the 'proximity test' under the English duty of care (to do with closeness of relationship). The idea of legal causation is that if no one can foresee something bad happening, and therefore take care to avoid it, how could anyone be responsible? For instance, in ''[[Palsgraf v. Long Island Rail Road Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Palsgraf v. Long Island Rail Road Co.'' (1928) 162 N.E. 99&lt;/ref&gt; the judge decided that the defendant, a [[railway]], was not liable for an injury suffered by a distant bystander.  The plaintiff, Palsgraf, was hit by coin-operated scale which toppled because of fireworks explosion that fell on her as she waited on a train platform. The scales fell because of a far-away commotion but it was not clear that what type of commotion caused the scale to fall,either it was the explosion's effect or the confused movement of the terrified people. A train [[Conductor (transportation)|conductor]] had run to help a man into a departing train. The man was carrying a package as he jogged to jump in the train door. The package had fireworks in it. The conductor mishandled the passenger or his package, causing the package to fall. The fireworks slipped and exploded on the ground causing shockwaves to travel through the platform.Which became the cause of commotion on platform &amp; As a consequence, the scales fell.&lt;ref&gt;The plaintiff's physical injuries were minor and more likely caused by a stampede of travelers on the platform rather than the concussion of the exploding fireworks.  These details have not, however, stopped the case from becoming the source of extensive debate in [[United States|American]] tort law.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Palsgraf was hurt by the falling scales, she sued the [[train]] company who employed the conductor for negligence.&lt;ref&gt;She could have sued the man or the conductor himself, but they did not have as much money as the company. Often, in litigation, where two defendants are equally liable but one is more able to satisfy a judgment, he will be the preferred defendant and is referred to as the "deep pocket."&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendant train company argued it should not be liable as a matter of law, because despite the fact that they employed the employee, who was negligent, his negligence was too remote from the plaintiff's injury. On appeal, the majority of the court agreed, with four judges adopting the reasons, written by Judge Cardozo, that the defendant owed no duty of care to the plaintiff, because a duty was owed only to foreseeable plaintiffs. Three judges dissented, arguing, as written by Judge Andrews, that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff, regardless of foreseeability, because all men owe one another a duty not to act negligently.

Such disparity of views on the element of remoteness continues to trouble the judiciary. Courts that follow Cardozo's view have greater control in negligence cases. If the court can find that, as a matter of law, the defendant owed no duty of care to the plaintiff, the plaintiff will lose his case for negligence before having a chance to present to the jury. Cardozo's view is the majority view. However, some courts follow the position put forth by Judge Andrews. In jurisdictions following the minority rule, defendants must phrase their remoteness arguments in terms of proximate cause if they wish the court to take the case away from the jury.

Remoteness takes another form, seen in ''[[The Wagon Mound (No. 2)]]''.&lt;ref name= "Wagon Mound #2 PC"&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants=[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v The Miller Steamship Co]] (Wagon Mound No. 2) |year=1966 |court=UKPC |num=10 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1967] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 617; [1967] 2 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 709 |courtname=auto |juris=NSW |date=25 May 1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wagon Mound was a ship in [[Sydney]] harbour. The ship leaked oil creating a slick in part of the harbour.  The wharf owner asked the ship owner about the danger and was told he could continue his work because the slick would not burn.  The wharf owner allowed work to continue on the wharf, which sent sparks onto a rag in the water which ignited and created a fire which burnt down the wharf. The Privy Council determined that the wharf owner 'intervened' in the causal chain, creating a responsibility for the fire which canceled out the liability of the ship owner.

In Australia the concept of remoteness, or proximity, was tested with the case of ''Jaensch v Coffey''.&lt;ref name="Jaensch v Coffey"/&gt; The wife of a policeman, Mrs Coffey suffered a nervous shock injury from the aftermath of a motor vehicle collision although she was not actually at the scene at the time of the collision. The court upheld that, in addition to it being reasonably foreseeable that his wife might suffer such an injury, it required that there be sufficient proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant who caused the collision. Here there was sufficient causal proximity. See also ''Kavanagh v Akhtar'',&lt;ref name="Kavanagh v Akhtar"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|779|1998|litigants=Kavanagh v Akhtar |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Imbree v McNeilly'',&lt;ref name="Imbree v McNeilly"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|2008|litigants=Imbree v McNeilly |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Tame v NSW''.&lt;ref name="Tame HCA"/&gt;

===Injury===
Even though there is breach of duty, and the cause of some injury to the defendant, a plaintiff may not recover unless he can prove that the defendant's breach caused a pecuniary injury. This should not be mistaken with the requirements that a plaintiff prove harm to recover. As a general rule, a plaintiff can only rely on a legal remedy to the point that he proves that he suffered a loss; it was reasonably foreseeable. It means something more than pecuniary loss is a necessary element of the plaintiff's case in negligence. When damages are not a necessary element, a plaintiff can win his case without showing that he suffered any loss; he would be entitled to [[nominal damages]] and any other damages according to proof. (See ''[[Constantine v Imperial Hotels Ltd]]'' [1944] KB]).

Negligence is different in that the plaintiff must prove his loss, and a particular kind of loss, to recover. In some cases, a defendant may not dispute the loss, but the requirement is significant in cases where a defendant cannot deny his negligence, but the plaintiff suffered no pecuniary loss as a result even though he had suffered emotional injury or damage but he cannot be compensated for these kind of losses.The plaintiff can be compensated for emotional or non-pecuniary losses on the condition that If the plaintiff can prove pecuniary loss, then he can also obtain damages for non-pecuniary injuries, such as emotional distress.

The requirement of pecuniary loss can be shown in a number of ways. A plaintiff who is physically injured by allegedly negligent conduct may show that he had to pay a medical bill. If his property is damaged, he could show the income lost because he could not use it, the cost to repair it, although he could only recover for one of these things.

The damage may be physical, purely economic, both physical and economic (loss of earnings following a personal injury,&lt;ref&gt;See, eg, {{cite AustLII|HCA|8|1977|litigants=Sharman v Evans |parallelcite=(1977) 138 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 563 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) or reputational (in a [[defamation]] case).

In English law, the right to claim for purely [[economic loss]] is limited to a number of 'special' and clearly defined circumstances, often related to the nature of the duty to the plaintiff as between clients and lawyers, financial advisers, and other professions where money is central to the consultative services.

[[Negligent infliction of emotional distress|Emotional distress]] has been recognized as an actionable tort. Generally, emotional distress damages had to be parasitic. That is, the plaintiff could recover for emotional distress caused by injury, but only if it accompanied a physical or pecuniary injury.

A claimant who has suffered only emotional distress and no pecuniary loss would not recover for negligence. However, courts have recently allowed recovery for a plaintiff to recover for purely emotional distress under certain circumstances. The state courts of [[California]] allowed recovery for emotional distress alone{{spaced ndash}}even in the absence of any physical injury, when the defendant physically injures a relative of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff witnesses it.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Dillon v. Legg]]'', 68 Cal. 2d 728 (1968) and ''[[Molien]] v. [[Kaiser Foundation|Kaiser Foundation Hospitals]]'', 27 Cal. 3d 916 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

The eggshell skull rule is a legal doctrine upheld in some tort law systems, which holds that a tortfeasor is liable for the full extent of damage caused, even where the extent of the damage is due to the unforeseen frailty of the claimant. The eggshell skull rule was recently maintained in Australia in the case of ''Kavanagh v Akhtar''.&lt;ref name="Kavanagh v Akhtar"/&gt;

==Damages==
{{Main|Damages}}
Damages place a monetary value on the harm done, following the principle of ''[[restitutio in integrum]]'' ([[Latin]] for "restoration to the original condition"). Thus, for most purposes connected with the quantification of damages, the degree of [[culpability]] in the breach of the duty of care is irrelevant. Once the breach of the duty is established, the only requirement is to compensate the victim.

One of the main tests that is posed when deliberating whether a claimant is entitled to compensation for a tort, is the "[[reasonable person]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Blyth v Birmingham Waterworks Co'' (1856) Ex Ch 781&lt;/ref&gt; The test is self-explanatory: would a reasonable person (as determined by a judge or jury), under the given circumstances, have done what the defendant did to cause the injury in question; or, in other words, would a reasonable person, acting reasonably, have engaged in similar conduct when compared to the one whose actions caused the injury in question? Simple as the "reasonable person" test sounds, it is very complicated. It is a risky test because it involves the opinion of either the judge or the jury that can be based on limited facts. However, as vague as the "reasonable person" test seems, it is extremely important in deciding whether or not a plaintiff is entitled to compensation for a negligence tort.

Damages are compensatory in nature.  Compensatory damages addresses a plaintiff/claimant's losses (in cases involving physical or mental injury the amount awarded also compensates for pain and suffering). The award should make the plaintiff whole, sufficient to put the plaintiff back in the position he or she was before Defendant's negligent act.  Anything more would unlawfully permit a plaintiff to profit from the tort.

There are also two other general principles relating to damages. Firstly, the award of damages should take place in the form of a single lump sum payment. Therefore, a defendant should not be required to make periodic payments (however some statutes give exceptions for this). Secondly, the Court is not concerned with how the plaintiff uses the award of damages. For example, if a plaintiff is awarded $100,000 for physical harm, the plaintiff is not required to spend this money on medical bills to restore them to their original position - they can spend this money any way they want.&lt;ref name="'Todorovic v Waller"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|72|1981|litigants=Todorovic v Waller |parallelcite=(1981) 150 [[COmmonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 402 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Types of damage
* [[Special damages]] - quantifiable dollar losses suffered from the date of defendant's negligent act (the tort) up to a specified time (proven at trial).  Special damage examples include lost wages, medical bills, and damage to property such as one's car.
* [[General damages]] - these are damages that are not quantified in monetary terms (e.g., there's no invoice or receipt as there would be to prove special damages).  A general damage example is an amount for the pain and suffering one experiences from a car collision. Lastly, where the plaintiff proves only minimal loss or damage, or the court or jury is unable to quantify the losses, the court or jury may award [[nominal damages]].
* [[Punitive damages]] - Punitive damages are to punish a defendant, rather than to compensate plaintiffs, in negligence cases. In most jurisdictions punitive damages are recoverable in a negligence action, but only if the plaintiff shows that the defendant’s conduct was more than ordinary negligence (i.e., wanton and willful or reckless).
* Aggravated damages - In contrast to exemplary damages, compensation are given to the plaintiff when the harm is aggravated by the defendant's conduct. For example, the manner of this wrongful act increased the injury by subjecting the plaintiff to humiliation, insult.&lt;ref name="NSW v Riley"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|208|2003|litigants=State of NSW v Riley |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure in the United States==
The United States generally recognizes four elements to a negligence action: duty, breach, proximate causation and injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Negligence and Tort Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/negligence.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[plaintiff]] who makes a negligence claim must prove all four elements of negligence in order to win his or her case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Healey|first1=Paul D.|title=Chicken Little at the Reference Desk: The Myth of Librarian Liability|journal=Law Library Journal|date=1995|volume=87|page=515|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/llj87&amp;div=38&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if it is highly unlikely that the plaintiff can prove one of the elements, the defendant may request judicial resolution early on, to prevent the case from going to a jury. This can be by way of a [[demurrer]], motion to dismiss, or motion for [[summary judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Currie|first1=David P.|title=Thoughts on Directed Verdicts and Summary Judgments|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Autumn 1977|volume=45|issue=1|pages=72–79|jstor=1599201|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elements allow a defendant to test a plaintiff's accusations before trial, as well as providing a guide to the [[finder of fact]] at trial (the judge in a bench trial, or jury in a jury trial) to decide whether the defendant is or is not liable. Whether the case is resolved with or without trial again depends heavily on the particular facts of the case, and the ability of the parties to frame the issues to the court. The duty and causation elements in particular give the court the greatest opportunity to take the case from the jury, because they directly involve questions of policy.&lt;ref name="mclauchlan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLauchlan|first1=William P.|title=An Empirical Study of the Federal Summary Judgment Rule|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|date=June 1977|volume=6|issue=2|pages=427–459|doi=10.1086/467581}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court can find that regardless of any disputed facts, the case may be resolved as a matter of law from undisputed facts because as a matter of law the defendant cannot be legally responsible for the plaintiff's injury under a theory of negligence.&lt;ref name="mclauchlan"/&gt;

On appeal, depending on the disposition of the case and the question on appeal, the court reviewing a trial court's determination that the defendant was negligent will analyze at least one of the elements of the cause of action to determine if it is properly supported by the facts and law. For example, in an appeal from a final judgment after a jury verdict, the appellate court will review the record to verify that the jury was properly instructed on each contested element, and that the record shows sufficient evidence for the jury's findings. On an appeal from a dismissal or judgment against the plaintiff without trial, the court will review ''[[De novo review|de novo]]'' whether the court below properly found that the plaintiff could not prove any or all of his or her case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofer|first1=Ronald R.|title=Standards of Review - Looking beyond the Labels|journal=Marquette Law Review|date=1990|volume=74|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/marqlr74&amp;div=14&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse''' at the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) was established by the [[Temperance movement|temperance]]-oriented [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] with an initial grant of $5 million, followed by more substantial funding.

As a national program office of the foundation, it established and is promoting the "A Matter of Degree" program. This is a major campus and community partnership demonstration project at ten [[colleges]] and [[universities]] across the [[United States]]. The goal of the program was to encourage local communities and campus administrations to work together to reduce situations and environments that would encourage high-risk or [[binge drinking]] among students.  Preliminary results of its effectiveness have not been positive.

Other projects focus on reducing [[alcoholic beverage]] [[advertising]], changing parental behaviors related to alcohol consumption, and alcoholic beverage [[taxes]].

==History==
A comprehensive competition law was first proposed in the late 1980s during the administration of President [[Cory Aquino]].&lt;ref name="RapplerJuly2015" /&gt;

The Philippines was the only country in [[ASEAN]] without a competition law and the integration of ASEAN into a single market was an impetus to pass the act.&lt;ref name="RapplerJuly2015" /&gt;

The '''Police Act 1964''' (1964 c.48) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that updated the legislation governing police forces in [[England and Wales]], constituted new police authorities, gave the [[Home Secretary]] new powers to supervise local constabularies, and allowed for the amalgamation of existing forces into more efficient units.

==Royal Commission==
A '''Royal Commission on the Police''' had been appointed in 1960 under the chairmanship of [[Henry Willink]] to ''"review the constitutional position of the police throughout Great Britain".'' 

The appointment of the commission followed two high-profile scandals involving borough police forces. These exposed problems in the relationship between the chief constable and [[watch committee]] of each borough, and disputes between central and local government over the control of local forces. In 1958, following a trial into police corruption in [[Brighton]], the presiding judge stated that the judiciary could have no faith in police evidence until the chief constable had been replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police need of "leader" - Judge's fear for Brighton force |work=The Times |date=7 March 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brighton Watch Committee complained that they could not properly supervise the force, as they had no access to the annual report of [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary]], which was sent to the Home Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Britain's police forces: forever removed from democratic control? |url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/archive/policy-paper-16.html |publisher=History &amp; Policy |first=Chris A. |last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 the watch committee of Nottingham suspended the city's chief constable, [[Athelstan Popkess]], when he refused to furnish a report on his investigations into alleged corruption of councillors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suspension Of Police Chief |work=The Times |date=10 July 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details of the investigation were however leaked to the press on the eve of municipal elections. The committee were subsequently forced to reinstate Popkess when the Home Secretary, [[Rab Butler]], threatened to withdraw central government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Captain Popkess To Resume On Monday |work=The Times |date=8 August 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Among the particular subjects for investigation by the commission were: 
*The constitution and functions of police authorities
*The accountability of police officers including chief constables
*The relationship of the police to the public and procedures for dealing with complaints
*The remuneration of police constables&lt;ref&gt;''Royal Commission on the Police 1960: interim report'', [http://www.bopcris.ac.uk/bopall/ref10993.html BOPCRIS website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004826/http://www.bopcris.ac.uk/bopall/ref10993.html |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission published its final report on 31 May 1962. This recommended an urgent review on the number and size of police areas. Among its recommendations were:
*No single national force was to be formed, but central government should exercise more powers over local forces
*Retention of small police forces of between 200 and 350 officers "justifiable only by special circumstances such as the distribution of the population and the geography of the area"
*The optimum size for a police force was more than 500 members, with the police area having a population of at least 250,000
*There was "a case" for single police forces for major conurbations
*A large reduction in the number of forces in Scotland was needed, to between 20 and 33

The commission noted that of 158 police forces in Great Britain, 97 had an establishment of less than 350.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Royal commission reject national police force |work=The Times |date=1 June 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Act==
The Act received [[royal assent]] on 10 June 1964. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dates for Police Act changes |work=The Times |date=19 June 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its provisions were:

*England and Wales, outside London, was to consist of "[[police area]]s". These were to be administrative counties, county boroughs or "combined police areas", consisting of combinations of counties and county boroughs.
*The Home Secretary had the power to force compulsory amalgamation schemes from 1 July 1964.
*New "[[Police authority|police authorities]]" were to be established: these were to be known as watch committees (in boroughs), police committees (in counties - replacing joint standing committees) or combined police authorities. 
*Police authorities were to consist of two-thirds elected members and one-third magistrates. Previously all members of watch committees had been councillors or aldermen, while county SJCs were fifty percent county councillors and aldermen, fifty percent magistrates. 
*The police authorities had less powers than their predecessors, especially the boroughs, with the Home Secretary taking on more supervision than before. The authority were required to maintain an efficient police force, but had no operational role.
*Chief constables were given the power to appoint, direct and control special constables.
*The chief constable could appoint [[British Police Cadets|police cadets]] with the permission of the authority.
*The chief constable was required to make an annual report to the police authority.
*A police authority could also request other reports on policing in the police area.
*Police authorities were empowered to choose chief constables, deputy and assistant chief constables from a [[Home Office]] shortlist. They could also require the Chief Constable to retire, subject to the Home Secretary's approval.
*The Home Secretary could order a complaint against a police force to be investigated by officers of another force.

==Amalgamations==
On 10 July 1964, the Home Secretary, [[Henry Brooke, Baron Brooke of Cumnor|Henry Brooke]], announced he would be using his powers under the Act to amalgamate the county borough forces of Luton and Northampton with the county forces of Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire respectively.

Luton's force had only been formed on 1 April, when it became a county borough, but Mr Brooke said he did not regard the continuance of its existence as in the best interests of policing efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2 boroughs to lose police forces |work=The Times |date=11 July 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The amalgamations were vigorously, but unsuccessfully, opposed by the boroughs: Luton's campaign went as far as serving a High Court writ on the Home Secretary in an attempt to stop the merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Luton writ against Home Secretary |work=The Times |date=22 December 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, the first amalgamation under the Act took place on 1 April 1965 as the result of local government reorganisation, with the formation of the [[Mid Anglia Constabulary]].

Following a change in government at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|general election]], [[Frank Soskice]] became Home Secretary. In 1965 he announced that Exeter City's force would be merged with that of Devon. In addition to the Bedfordshire/Luton, Devon/Exeter, and Northamptonshire/Northampton mergers, 1966 saw the establishment of a new West Midlands Constabulary covering the county boroughs of [[Dudley]], [[Walsall]], [[County Borough of Warley|Warley]], [[West Bromwich]] and [[Wolverhampton]], which had been constituted or enlarged by local government reorganisation.  

===1966 amalgamation scheme===
On 16 May 1966, the new [[Home Secretary]], [[Roy Jenkins]] announced that the number of police forces in [[England]] and [[Wales]] was to be reduced from 117 to 49. Where the local authorities concerned did not agree a voluntary scheme he would make a compulsory amalgamation.

====Proposed amalgamations====
#Lancashire County Constabulary to merge with borough police forces of Barrow-in-Furness, Blackburn, Blackpool, Bolton, Burnley, Oldham, Rochdale, St Helens, Southport, Warrington and Wigan
#Borough forces of Manchester, Salford and Stockport to merge

#Glamorgan Constabularies with Merthyr Tydfil, Cardiff and Swansea borough forces
#Pembrokeshire, Cardiganshire &amp; Carmarthenshire† and Mid Wales† Constabularies
#Monmouthshire Constabulary and Newport Borough Police
*It was also envisaged that the forces of Gateshead, Newcastle upon Tyne, South Shields and Tynemouth would be combined into a single Tyneside force if the recommendations of the [[Local Government Commission for England (1958 - 1967)|Local Government Commission for England]] were carried into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=70 police forces to be axed in mergers |work=The Times |date=19 May 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
† Existing combined force

===Amalgamations carried out===
The amalgamations carried out under the Act differed slightly from the original scheme announced in 1966. In Yorkshire, The North and East Riding constabularies were combined with York City Police, while the borough forces of Hull and Teesside were allowed to continue unmerged. Stockport Borough Police were amalgamated with the Cheshire Constabulary instead of with Manchester and Salford, and the scheme for a Tyneside force was dropped when the Local Government Commission's recommendations were not carried out. Instead Northumberland Constabulary was merged with the two county boroughs north of the Tyne, and Durham Constabulary absorbed those on south Tyneside.

===Police areas unaffected by amalgamations===
The following territorial police forces were not subject to amalgamations under the 1964 Act:
*In Greater London: The [[Metropolitan Police]], [[City of London Police]]
*County constabularies: Hertfordshire, Surrey, Wiltshire
*Combined constabularies: Gloucestershire, Kent 
*Borough/City forces: Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Kingston-upon-Hull, Leeds

==Later changes==
Several of the amalgamated forces formed under the 1964 Act had short existences, as a wholesale reorganisation of local government in England and Wales outside London was carried out in 1974 under the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Police areas were realigned to correspond to one or more of the [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan]] or [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] created by the 1972 legislation. The sections on the composition of police authorities were repealed by the [[Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994]], and new authorities constituted.

{{Wills, trusts, estates}}
A '''power of appointment''' is a term most frequently used in the [[law]] of [[will (law)|wills]] to describe the ability of the [[testator]] (the person writing the will) to select a person who will be given the authority to dispose of certain property under the will. Although any person can exercise this power at any time during their life, its use is rare outside of a will. The power is divided into two broad categories: '''general powers of appointment''' and '''special powers of appointment'''. The holder of a power of appointment differs from the [[trustee]] of a trust in that the former has no obligation to manage the property for the generation of income, but need only distribute it.

==General power of appointment==
''Example: "I leave my video game collection to be distributed as my son Andrew sees fit."''

A general power of appointment is defined for federal [[estate tax]] purposes in the [[Internal Revenue Code]] §2041.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=RETRIEVE&amp;FILE=$$xa$$busc26.wais&amp;start=15995806&amp;SIZE=8880&amp;TYPE=TEXT |title= Internal Revenue Code §2041 |publisher=Frwebgate.access.gpo.gov |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A general power of appointment is one which allows the holder of the power to appoint to himself, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his or her estate the right to have the beneficial use and enjoyment of certain property covered by the power of appointment. The holder of a general power of appointment is treated for estate tax purposes as if he or she is the owner of the property subject to the power, whether or not the power is exercised. Thus, the property which is subject to the power is includable in the power holder's estate for estate tax purposes.

A general power of appointment is a key element of a type of [[marital deduction]] [[tax law]] as prescribed in [[Internal Revenue Code]] §2056(b)(5). It is a trust that qualifies for the marital deduction, provided that the surviving spouse is given the income at least annually and the surviving spouse has a general power of appointment over the trust property remaining at his death.

Most general powers of appointment are exercisable under a [[will (law)|will]]. The holder of the power refers to the document creating the power in his or her will and designates who among the permissible objects of the power should receive the property. The power could be exercised by creating further trusts.

If the power of appointment is not exercised, the default provision of the document that created the power takes over.

==Special power of appointment==
''Example: "I leave my cactus collection to my children, my wife Pat to choose who receives which cactus."''

A special power of appointment allows the recipient to distribute the designated property among a specified group or class of people, not including donee, donee's estate, creditors of donee, or creditors of donee's estate.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., New York Estates Powers and Trusts Law § 10-3.2.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a testator might grant his brother the special power to distribute property among the testator's three children. The brother would then have the authority to choose which of the testator's children gets which property. Unlike a general power of appointment, the refusal of the appointed party to exercise a specific power of appointment causes the designated property to revert as a gift to the members of a group or a class.

A special power of appointment may be exclusive or nonexclusive. If exclusive, the donee can appoint all the property to one or more members of the class of permissible appointees to the exclusion of the other members of the class. If nonexclusive, the donee must appoint some property to each object.&lt;ref&gt;Dukeminier, J. et al.  ''Wills, Trusts, and Estates, Eighth Edition.''  Aspen Publishers, New York: 2009, p. 822&lt;/ref&gt;

Special powers of appointment also appear in the context of a trust and are primarily used to reduce liability for [[generation-skipping transfer tax]], or to provide [[asset protection trust]] features without [[fraudulent conveyance]] liability.  Such trusts are referred to as '''[[SPA Trust]]s'''.

==Testamentary power and power presently exercisable==
In addition to general and special powers, donors may limit when the power may be exercised by the donees. Testamentary powers are usually indicated by the inclusion of limiting language in the granting instrument such as "to B for life, remainder to persons as B shall 'by will' appoint".  General powers presently exercisable do not contain such limitations on power. Wording such as "to B for life, and upon B's death to those that B shall appoint" indicates a power presently exercisable, not a testamentary power.

In some jurisdictions, the donee's creditors cannot reach the appointive property when the donee has a presently exercisable power of appointment as long as the power is unexercised.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., ''Irwin Union Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Long'', 312 N.E.2d 908 (Indiana 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pregnancy Discrimination Act''' ('''PDA''') of 1978 ({{USPL|95|555}}) is a [[United States federal statute]]. It amended [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VII|Title VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] to "prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/pregnancy.cfm Text of the Act from the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act covers discrimination "on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions." The pregnancy must be deemed as a normal, objectifiable condition, for that to be enacted. Employers with fewer than 15 employees are exempted from the Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-preg.html Facts About Pregnancy Discrimination] from the [[U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/pregnancy.cfm Pregnancy Discrimination] from the [[U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; Employers are exempt from providing medical coverage for elective abortions, unless the mother's life is threatened, but are required to provide disability and sick leave for women who are recovering from an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Congress and the Nation, s.vv. "1798," "Pregnancy Disability."
Vol. V, 1977-1980, p. 797
&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the Act ==

The law was passed as a direct response to a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[General Electric Company v. Gilbert]]'', which held that [[pregnancy discrimination]] was not a form of [[sex discrimination]] under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://verdict.justia.com/2015/03/31/forceps-delivery-the-supreme-court-narrowly-saves-the-pregnancy-discrimination-act-in-young-v-ups|title=Forceps Delivery: The Supreme Court Narrowly Saves the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in Young v. UPS|accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]' decision in [[Young v. United Parcel Service]], Inc. provided additional clarity on whether and when employers are required to provide work-related accommodations to pregnant employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chin|first1=Michael|title=Supreme Court Vacates Employer Victory in Pregnancy Discrimination Case|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/supreme-court-vacates-employer-victory-pregnancy-discrimination-case|accessdate=25 April 2015|work=The National Law Review|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit stemmed from [[United Parcel Service]]'s refusal to accommodate a 20-pound lifting restriction of a driver during her pregnancy. Because Ms. Young could not lift the required 70 pounds for drivers, UPS did not allow her to work. Ms. Young  provided evidence that a number of employees received accommodations while suffering similar or more serious disabilities. According to the testimony of one UPS employee, the only time a light duty request seemed to become an issue occurred when the request was made by a pregnant employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leonoro|first1=Joesph|title=U.S. Supreme Court Tackles Pregnancy Discrimination in the Workplace|journal=The National Law Review|date=2 April 2015|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/us-supreme-court-tackles-pregnancy-discrimination-workplace|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court held that a pregnant employee can make a [[prima facie]], meaning a plausible case of discrimination, by showing that "she belongs to the protected class, that she sought accommodation, that the employer did not accommodate her. The Court further held that a plaintiff can meet a summary judgement standard "by providing evidence that the employer accommodates a large percentage of nonpregnant workers while failing to accommodate a large percentage of pregnant workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Brandon|title=Pregnancy Discrimination Claims after Young v. UPS|url=http://mcbrayeremploymentlaw.com/2015/04/13/pregnancy-discrimination-claims-after-young-v-ups/|website=McBrayer Employment Law|publisher=McBrayer, McGinnis, Leslie &amp; Kirkland, PLLC|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Disability clause ==

Pregnancy is considered a temporary disability in the eyes of the law, meaning the treatment of pregnant employees falls under the same jurisdiction as disabled employees. Treating a pregnant employee in a way that would violate disability standards is also a violation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA). 

&lt;blockquote&gt;If an employee is temporarily unable to perform her job due to pregnancy, the employer must treat her the same as any other temporarily disabled employee; for example, by providing light duty, modified tasks, alternative assignments, disability leave, or leave without pay. An employer may have to provide a reasonable accommodation for a disability related to pregnancy, absent undue hardship (significant difficulty or expense)." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/fs-preg.cfm|title=Facts About Pregnancy Discrimination|website=www.eeoc.gov|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Critical cases ==

The [[Geduldig v. Aiello]] case in 1974 involved a pregnant woman who was denied medical benefits under her disability insurance, citing the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], and claiming sex discrimination. The U.S. Supreme Court found that there was no evidence of sex discrimination, and that there was no violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]], as men and women were both receiving equal protection under the insurance program, and since men can not become pregnant, offering protections for pregnancy be unequal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/417/484/case.html|title=Geduldig v. Aiello  417 U.S. 484 (1974)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|http://www.jurist.org/feature/2014/12/background-for-pda.php=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case also did not use a heightened level of scrutiny, meaning the court did not treat this case as one of high importance, which was criticized by Justice Brennan in a dissent noting that physical gender differences should not lead to unequal compensation, and gender cases should always use strict scrutiny.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jurist.org/feature/2014/12/background-for-pda.php|title=JURIST -     History of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act|website=www.jurist.org|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[General Electric v. Gilbert]] in many ways was influenced by the decision of Geduldig v. Aiello, as the court again found no evidence of discrimination. Again, Justice Brennan dissented, noting for a second time that women were receiving unequal compensation. Due to this dissent and the dissent from Geduldig v. Aiello, U.S. Congress saw a gap in protections and created the Pregnancy Discrimination Act two years later in response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Other important cases ==

[[California Federal Savings and Loan Association v Guerra]]  (1987) Lillian Garland worked as a receptionist for California Federal Savings and Loan Association for a few years as a receptionist when she became pregnant. She took pregnancy disability leave in January, and notified Cal. Fed. of her intent to return in April. On giving notice of her intent to return to work, she was informed that her job was now held by someone else and there were not equivalent available positions for her.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Equal Means Equal: Why the Time For an Equal Rights Amendment is Now|last=Neuwirth|first=Jessica|publisher=The New Press|year=2015|isbn=978-1-62097-039-3|location=New York|pages=34|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/479/272.html|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon filing a lawsuit, Cal. Fed. argued that the law was discriminatory towards men and violated [[Title VII]] by giving women more rights than men, instead of equal rights. The court held that because protection against pregnancy discrimination was law in California, Garland was given her job back, but they held that nationally, women are not allowed "preferential treatment" due to pregnancy.

[[Rent-A-Center West, Inc. v.Jackson|Rent-A-Center West, Inc. v. Jackson]] (2010) Natasha Jackson was the only woman employee working at Rent-A-Center when she became pregnant. She struggled with morning sickness and also was given a doctor's note restricting her from lifting more than 25 pounds, a task rarely assigned to her position. Her district manager put her on paid leave for two-weeks, but after learning of the doctor's note, told her she could not work until she had delivered her baby and that there was no guarantee of her job being there when she returned. Two months after her baby was born she tried to return to work with a doctor's note and was fired anyway. She filed a pregnancy discrimination case and then changed the complaint to arbitration; she lost her case after three years.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/32/604.html Rentzer v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd.] (1973) Gail Rentzer suffered from an ectopic pregnancy and was therefore unable to work. She was denied compensation by the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board because they did not recognize pregnancy or related medical complications as a disability. After filing a lawsuit against them, the court found that because Gail had not had a normal pregnancy and her emergency surgery was performed to stop bleeding and save her life, her pregnancy was deemed worthy of disability benefits. This case allowed women with medical complications during pregnancy to be granted benefits and more protections, such as disability coverage for not just pregnancy, but also the amount of time it takes for recovery from complications.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/11-3387/11-3387-2012-06-12.html Arizanovska v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.] (2012) Svetlana Arizanovska was working as a shelf stocker at Wal-Mart when she became pregnant, and her doctor told her not to lift more than 20 pounds. She was assigned light-duty work for a little while, but then was told there were no more light assignments available and she was directed to go back to regular work. While lifting, she began to bleed, and upon telling her boss she was told to go back to work, and later learned she had suffered a miscarriage. She became pregnant again 4 months later, and was given orders to lift no more than 10 pounds, but was cleared to work by her doctor. Wal-Mart again said they had no light-duty assignments for her, and put her on unpaid leave, then fired her. Arizanovska miscarried again, and presented the reason as stress due to unemployment. She lost her case both in district and appeals court.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

All of these cases give background on what is and is not covered by amendments and acts currently in the U.S. Constitution. The major argument in most cases that lost in court was that providing benefits for pregnant workers gave women more benefits that men had, as pregnancy can not occur within a male body.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  This therefore shut down the cases being tried under the 14th Amendment, as it is "Equal Protection". Other cases show that pregnancies that are not "normal" or have complications, are covered by the PDA and disability, but normal pregnancies are not.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some cases, such as Rentzer v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. are examples of cases which actually changed or added to the PDA, while most of the others display their limitations.

== Critiques of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act ==

The act has received many critiques about what people are protected, and what is protected by the clause. Some critics say that the Act protects employees in a way that is too focused on biology, and does not protect the social aspects of motherhood. That is, while employees would be protected by the PDA for missing work due to her pregnancy, they would not be protected if they had to miss work to care for their sick child.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habig|first=Jill E.|year=2008|title=Defining the Protected Class: Who Qualifies for Protection under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act?|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume= 117| issue =  6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critiques include that the Act does not take into consideration the social, cultural, and financial effects of having the capacity to become pregnant, even if one is not currently pregnant. This means that women are discriminated against in the workplace due to the fact that they could become pregnant, causing them to be given lower wages, fewer promotions, and less authority in the workplace. Criticizers note that because the PDA protects against discrimination "on the basis of pregnancy" that wage differences, lack of advancement, hiring, firing and other discriminatory acts towards women are due to their childbearing capacity, and should be protected by the PDA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some Liberal Feminists argue that asking for too much under the PDA would actually lead to ''unequal'' compensation, and put pregnant workers in the position of losing benefits of the act all together.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vogel|first=Lise|year=1990|title=Debating Difference: Feminism, Pregnancy, and the Workplace|journal=Feminist Studies|publisher=Feminist Studies, Inc.|volume=16| issue =  1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They argue that because pregnancy is considered a disability, asking for more disability leave for a pregnancy or complications after a pregnancy could extend the time considered equal to what non-pregnant individuals would take for disability leave, and put them in a position which would allow termination. They hold that special treatment in terms of benefits for an entire group would not be as beneficial as equal treatment. Since Liberal Feminists take an individualistic approach to feminist theory, focusing on women gaining and keeping equality through their own actions and choices, this critique does apply to many Liberal Feminists. However, another group of Liberal Feminists argue that this approach is too concerned with policy and not concerned enough with results for women, noting that this theory would not actually help pregnant workers at all, and perhaps put them more at risk for termination.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This group of Liberal Feminists also state that the "extra" benefits that would be provided with the PDA would be putting women on equal ground with men, allowing them to be more equal competitors in their professional lives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A Pluralist Radical Feminist critique of the PDA notes that pregnancy should not be considered a disability at all.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkeley Journal of Gender Law|year=1990|title=Difference, Dominance, Differences: Feminist Theory, Equality, and the Law|journal=Berkeley Journal of Gender, Law &amp; Justice|publisher=BerkeleyWomen's L.J.|volume=5| issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the PDA classifying pregnancy as a disability is too reflective of a phallocentric view of pregnancy, as it refuses to treat pregnancy with its own model and forces it into the same system that men use when "disabled" even though they cannot experience this. They would argue that a body with the potential to become pregnant does not only have a chance of experiencing pregnancy, but also the unique conditions and complications that may come along with it, and that forcing pregnancy into the guidelines of disability can not fully provide pregnant workers with the protections they need.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Transgender exclusion is also a critique of the PDA. Transgender men who still have the capacity to become pregnant are often excluded from the protections of the act due to the language and scope of the protected class defined by the PDA. The PDA states that it protects: "women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions" which leaves transgender men, and non-binary gender identities outside of the protected class. Many theorists and activists are pushing to change the language of the PDA to make sure that all gender identities will be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Currah|first=Paisley|date=2008|title=Expecting Bodies: The Pregnant Man and Transgender Exclusion from the Employment Non-Discrimination Act|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|volume= 36| issue =  3 &amp; 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many feminists of all backgrounds argue that all of these issues could be avoided if the constitution were to include the [[Equal Rights Amendment]](ERA).The ERA "was a [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Proposing amendments|proposed amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] designed to guarantee [[Gender equality|equal rights for women]]." It is argued that if the ERA were in place, the Constitution would automatically hold that men and women have equal rights to work and family simultaneously, as sex equality would be a constitutional right without loopholes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Seeing as Constitutional Amendments and Acts currently do not fully protect workers from pregnancy discrimination, even those that are meant to give equal protections, such as Title XIV and Title VII, many believe the ERA would give protections to pregnant workers more easily.  If the ERA were constituted in addition to the PDA, this would allow even more protections under the constitution for pregnant peoples.

'''Rower woman'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ghm9NoHr-N0C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=%22rower+women%22+stockholm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vfxraF1X7c&amp;sig=QcsuJo8_gNbdYDoL2GJ2-rKZMhQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gIfnTrqhLonw8QPr2eDrCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rower%20women%22%20stockholm&amp;f=false Allan Pred: ''Lost words and lost worlds''] Cambridge University Press 1990, page 69. Retrieved 2011-12-13&lt;/ref&gt; (in Swedish called '''Roddarmadam''', literally: "Rower Madam"), was a female profession in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, from the 15th century until the early 20th century. It consisted of women who ran a form of early [[water taxi]]; rowing people between the islands of Stockholm, to and from the islands of the [[Stockholm archipelago]], as well as to and from places around [[Mälaren|Lake Mälaren]] on the other side of Stockholm.

== History ==
The Stockholm rower women are mentioned in text from the 15th century, and in 1638 they formed a special group within the Swedish ferrymen [[guild]]. They handled most of the traffic over the waters of the capital, working in teams of two, taking passengers between its islands, into [[Mälaren|Lake Mälaren]], and to and from islands in the [[Stockholm archipelago]]. They could be either married or unmarried, and they inherited their boats from mother to daughter, or bought them from retired colleagues. They were businesswomen famed for their blunt manner and coarse language. So much so, that in 1759, a law was introduced which specified that they must be sober and maintain a civil language. They were very visible because of their large "weather hoods", a special hat very suited when rowing in bad weather. 

In the 1690s, a visiting Italian was impressed by the strength and great speed of the rower women in Stockholm. In 1763, [[Carl Michael Bellman]] attracted attention when he came to conflict with one of the rower women and managed to win the argument&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Ericsson, Magnus Hansson, Christer Jörgensson (2002). Stockholm- historien om den stolta staden (Stockholm - history of the proud city) B. Wahlströms. {{ISBN|91-32-32799-4}} (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; During his visit to Sweden in 1787, [[Francisco de Miranda]] described the rower women as: "Good women who rows like devils!"&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Ericsson, Magnus Hansson, Christer Jörgensson (2002). Stockholm- historien om den stolta staden (Stockholm - history of the proud city) B. Wahlströms. {{ISBN|91-32-32799-4}} (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;    

During the 19th century, the rower women found increasing competition. Following ''[[Fabriks och Handtwerksordning]]'' in 1846, which abolished all guild privileges and allowed anyone to start business in any sector of society, a private company acquired a license in 1848 for [[ferry]] traffic in Stockholm with boats propelled by hand-operated [[paddle wheel]]s instead of oars, worked by employed [[dalkulla|women from Dalarna]], who were dressed in their local [[folk costume]]s and taught to be nice and courteous to their customers.&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Söderberg, ''Stockholmsspegel'', Liber förlag (1984), {{ISBN|91-38-90460-8}}]&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later [[steam boat]]s started to take over the business from both types of boats and women.

In 1856, there were 96 rowing boats run by women, with the capacity of transporting 20-25 people in each boat. In 1875, when the rower woman profession was formally abolished (although they were allowed to continue their trade), there were five rowing boat stations in Stockholm, with a total of 23 rowing boats run by women. The number continued to diminish thereafter, and nobody knows exactly when the last rower woman retired herself. However, according to the Stockholm history author [[Per Anders Fogelström]], the activity may very well have continued up to [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Bladh, ''Rodderskor på Stockholms vatten'', Stockholmia förlag (2008), {{ISBN|91-7031-207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Servicio Geológico Minero''' is an Argentine government institution aimed at producing geological, mining and enronmental information to achieve [[sustained development]] and mitigate [[geological hazard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.segemar.gov.ar/index.php/institucional/funciones-y-objetivos Funciones y Objetivos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017231350/http://www.segemar.gov.ar/index.php/institucional/funciones-y-objetivos |date=2014-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution has its origin at the fusion of '''Dirección General de Minas y Geología''' and  '''Comisión de Estudios de Napas de Agua y Yacimientos Carboníferos''' in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.segemar.gov.ar/pdf/General/libro%20SEGEMAR%20100.pdf Historia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020115910/http://www.segemar.gov.ar/pdf/General/libro%20SEGEMAR%20100.pdf |date=2014-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first director was [[Enrique Hermitte]] who served in the charge until 1922. With Hermitte in charge the institution attracted a number European geologist to work for the institution including Richard Stappenbeck, John Keidel and [[Walther Penck]].&lt;ref name="Aceñolaza"&gt;{{Citation

The '''Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railway''' ('''SP&amp;S''') {{reporting mark|SPS}} was a [[United States]]-based [[railroad]] incorporated in 1905. It was a joint venture by the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] and the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] to build a railroad along the north bank of the [[Columbia River]]. Remnants of the line are currently operated by [[BNSF Railway]] and the [[Portland and Western Railroad]].

==History==
The railroad was chartered in 1905 by [[James J. Hill]] to connect the two transcontinental railroads owned by him, the [[Northern Pacific Railway|Northern Pacific]] (NP) and [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern]] (GN), to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] from [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]],&lt;ref&gt;''The history of bnsf: A legacy for the 21st century''. Railway: The employee magazine of burlington northern sante fe corporation, 27. Retrieved from http://www.bnsf.com/about-bnsf/our-railroad/company-history/pdf/hist_overview.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; to gain a portion of the lumber trade in Oregon, a business then dominated by [[E.H. Harriman]]'s [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] and [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] railroads. Construction began in 1906&lt;ref name="greatest year"&gt;"Greatest Year for Railroad Construction: Building in Territory Tributary to Portland During 1906 Breaks All Records—City Now Strategic Point in Struggle of Giants". (January 1, 1907). ''[[The Oregonian|The Morning Oregonian]]" (Portland), section 2, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; under the name Portland &amp; Seattle Railway,&lt;ref name="greatest year"/&gt;&lt;ref name="american rails"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american-rails.com/spokane-portland-and-seattle.html|title=The Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway, ''The Northwest’s Own Railway''|publisher=American-Rails.com|accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; proceeding eastward from [[Vancouver, Washington]].&lt;ref name="schafer2003"&gt;{{Schafer-Classic-Railroads-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1906 also saw the start of construction of the line between Vancouver and Portland, including work on three major new bridges, [[Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge 9.6|crossing the Columbia River]], the [[Oregon Slough Railroad Bridge|Oregon Slough]] and the [[Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge 5.1|Willamette River]].&lt;ref name="greatest year"/&gt; The northernmost of these was the first bridge of any kind to be built across the lower [[Columbia River]].&lt;ref name="last bolt"&gt;"Finish Bridge Over Columbia; Steel Structure of the Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railroad [sic] Completed—Last Bolt In Yesterday". (June 26, 1908). ''[[The Oregonian|The Morning Oregonian]]'' (Portland), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite legal challenges from Harriman, within a year the line had been built as far as [[Pasco, Washington]] along the Columbia River, where it connected with NP. The first section to open was from Pasco west to Cliffs (near [[Maryhill, Washington|Maryhill]]), a length of {{convert|112|mi|km}}, on December 15, 1907.&lt;ref name=history-6nov1908&gt;"History of North Bank Road". (November 6, 1908). ''The Morning Oregonian'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Operation was extended west to [[Lyle, Washington|Lyle]], {{convert|33|mi|km}} further west, on January 15, 1908, as construction continued on the {{convert|221|mi|km|adj=on}} section from Pasco to Vancouver.&lt;ref name=history-6nov1908/&gt; 
[[File:Ocean Shore Limited Spokane Portland and Seattle Railroad.JPG|thumb|200px|SP&amp;S also operated the ''Ocean Shore Limited'', shown here at [[Seaside, Oregon]]]]

In January 1908 "Spokane" was added to the railroad's name, making it the '''Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railway'''.&lt;ref name="changes name"&gt;"Important Articles Filed: North Bank Changes Name [from Portland &amp; Seattle Railway Company to Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railway Company], Increases Capital and Will Extend". (January 30, 1908). ''[[The Oregonian|The Morning Oregonian]]'' (Portland), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; SP&amp;S freight and passenger service (from Pasco) to Portland was inaugurated in November 1908.&lt;ref name="regular service"&gt;"First Train on Hill Road: Regular Passenger Service Inaugurated From Local Terminus". (November 18, 1908). ''The Morning Oregonian'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1909 the railroad had completed construction of its line up to Spokane along the [[Snake River]]. In 1910 SP&amp;S gained control of the [[Oregon Electric Railway|Oregon Electric]] interurban railway, which the Great Northern had acquired two years before. Under the control of the SP&amp;S the railroad was extended southward to [[Eugene, Oregon]] by 1912. SP&amp;S also operated a second subsidiary railroad in western Oregon, the [[Oregon Traction Company]],&lt;ref name="schafer2003"/&gt; which owned a route to [[Seaside, Oregon]].&lt;ref name="american rails"/&gt; 

[[File:Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railway.jpg|thumb|Oregon Traction Company route to Seaside (Holiday) in 1930]]
[[File:Oregon Trunk Line.jpg|thumb|Oregon Trunk RR route in 1931]]
A third route on which the SP&amp;S operated extended southward from [[Wishram, Washington]] to [[Bend, Oregon]] was the Oregon Trunk Railroad. Edward Harriman's Oregon &amp; Washington Railway &amp; Navigation Company also was building a railroad south from the Columbia River to Bend resulting in a railroad war in which each railroad attempted to sabotage the other. In the end, the railroad opened using mostly the track of the Oregon Trunk, with a short portion of the Oregon &amp; Washington Railway &amp; Navigation Company track, and both railroads used the route (an arrangement that still exists with BNSF owning the majority of the line and UP having trackage rights).&lt;ref name="schafer2003"/&gt;

During [[World War II]] the SP&amp;S carried war materials to the [[Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II|Pacific Theatre]]; new industries located along the Columbia River, taking advantage of cheap electricity from [[hydroelectric]] dams on the river.  New industries served by the SP&amp;S included aluminum plants, sawmills, chemical factories and grain elevators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spshs.org/history.html|title=HISTORY|publisher=SP&amp;S Railway Historical Society Railroad|year=2004|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 an SP&amp;S train derailed after hitting a rockslide on the route to Bend, Oregon. Part of the train landed in the [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]], including a boxcar, which landed in a rapid that was later named "[[Boxcar Rapids]]" after the incident, which killed all crew members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wasco-history.r9esd.k12.or.us/comm/maupin/oldpics/railroad/boxcar.html|title=S.P.&amp;S.

== Passenger trains ==

The SP&amp;S's passenger operations mostly involved hosting connections with parents' trains, such as the ''[[Empire Builder]]'' and ''[[North Coast Limited]]'', which were combined to form the Streamliner (#1/#2). ''[[Oriental Limited]]'', ''[[Mainstreeter]]'', and ''[[Western Star (train)|Western Star]]'' connected with (#3/#4).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  However, some of these SP&amp;S trains were named. The ''Inland Empire Express'' (daytime) and ''North Bank Limited'' (overnight) provided daily, through service between Portland ([[Union Station (Portland, Oregon)|Union Station]]) and Spokane.&lt;ref name=28feb1922&gt;"Mountain, River and Canyon Scenery to Spokane" (SP&amp;S advertisement). (February 28, 1922). ''[[The Oregonian|The Morning Oregonian]]'' (Portland), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Columbia River Express'' (#5/#6) operated between Portland and Pasco, connecting at Pasco with Northern Pacific #5/#6 for service to/from Spokane.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

'''''The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How It's Broken''''' is a 2018 book by an anonymous author known as The Secret Barrister. It is a critical first-hand account of the current state of the [[Criminal justice|criminal justice system]] in [[England and Wales]].

==Author==

The author, writing under the pseudonym of The Secret Barrister, is a [[junior barrister]] practising criminal law before the courts of England and Wales.{{sfn|Anonymous (The Secret Barrister)|2018|loc=inside dustjacket}} The Secret Barrister is also a [[blog]]ger who in 2016 and 2017 was named Independent Blogger of the Year at the Editorial Intelligence Comment Awards.{{sfn|Anonymous (The Secret Barrister)|2018|loc=inside dustjacket}} As of the book's publication date in March 2018 the author had a substantial following on [[Twitter]] of nearly 88,000.&lt;ref name="TheBrief"/&gt;

==Principal themes==

The book is loosely structured to follow the life of a criminal case from [[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]], through to [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] and [[appeal]]. It mixes first-hand accounts of the author as [[advocate]], acting at different times for the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] and the [[Defense (legal)|defence]], with a discussion of how the system in practice fails to deliver justice on a daily basis: "Access to justice, the rule of law, fairness to defendants, justice for victims – those fine emblems which we purport to hold so dear – are each day incarnated in effigy, rolled out in the Crown and magistrates' courts and ritually torched".{{sfn|Anonymous (The Secret Barrister)|2018|p=13}} 

The author argues that the public should be outraged by the chronic underfunding of the criminal justice system: "In every crumbling, decaying magistrates’ court and leaking Crown Court in the land, we see every day the law's equivalent of untreated, neglected patients on hospital trolleys. And every day it is met by a wall of silence".{{sfn|Anonymous (The Secret Barrister)|2018|p=330}}

The almost insuperable difficulties of ensuring that defendants are defended properly and prosecuted fairly are laid out: "The magistrates' court is the accident and emergency department of criminal justice: any moment a problem will walk through the door and the prosecutor will have to deal with it blind. Much prosecuting in the magistrates’ court takes the form of someone getting to their feet and presenting a case they have never set eyes on before".{{sfn|Anonymous (The Secret Barrister)|2018|p=76}}

The author is particularly critical of LASPO (the [[Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012|Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012]]), called in the book "The Innocence Tax" under which a defendant can be wrongly accused of a crime by the state, denied [[legal aid]] and - when [[Acquittal|acquitted]] - find themselves out of pocket by tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds in legal fees that the state will not repay.{{sfn|Anonymous (The Secret Barrister)|2018|p=215}}

The author also addresses policy issues, and argues that "a working criminal justice system, properly resourced and staffed by dedicated professionals ... serves to protect the innocent, protect the public and protect the integrity, decency and humanity of our society. This should be a societal baseline. Not a luxury".{{sfn|Anonymous (The Secret Barrister)|2018|p=16}}

The criminal justice system, the author argues, has suffered grievously in recent years from chronic underfunding.  Its flaws are not those of the people who work within it, but are imposed from without: by the state. Each flaw is "either deliberately designed – such as the Innocence Tax, or the restriction of compensation for miscarriages of justice – or is the product of populist, tough-on-crime, anti-defendant posturing, or betrays warped spending priorities where politicians persuade voters that one penny off a pint of lager is a better investment than a working justice system".{{sfn|Anonymous (The Secret Barrister)|2018|p=326}}

The author calls for proper resources to be made available to the legal system to enable it to deliver justice, for better public legal education including case law and statutes that are freely available online to the public to counter widespread public complacency ("it will never happen to me"),{{sfn|Anonymous (The Secret Barrister)|2018|pp=332–333}} {{sfn|Anonymous (The Secret Barrister)|2018|p=338}} and for better education for backbench [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|MP]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to enable them to challenge [[Minister (government)|government ministers]] or [[Ministry of Justice]] officials who use fallacious or dissembling arguments to gain support for a particular change in the law.{{sfn|Anonymous (The Secret Barrister)|2018|pp=202–203, 335–337}}

The author pays tribute to the great dedication of the professionals who work within the system: the police officers, [[Crown Prosecution Service|CPS]] prosecutors and caseworkers, defence solicitors, judges and magistrates, court staff, probation staff, prison officers and barristers.{{sfn|Anonymous (The Secret Barrister)|2018|pp=341–342}} But "It is not the enemy within, betraying our ideals of justice ... but the enemy outside. Today's danger is not the actors, but the director; the state moving the pieces and pulling the strings ... The end result is the same. When we lose sight of justice, it unfastens and floats away, leaving us with a nominal legal system; but not a justice system".{{sfn|Anonymous (The Secret Barrister)|2018|pp=343}}
== Parliament ==

On the day of the book's publication it was commended in [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|the House of Commons]] by the [[Shadow Cabinet|shadow Leader of the House]], [[Valerie Vaz]]: "I suggest that the [[Leader of the House of Commons|Leader of the House]] and all members of the Government read the book by the Secret Barrister, who states: 'Walk into any court in the land, speak to any lawyer, ask any judge and you will be treated to uniform complaints of court deadlines being repeatedly missed, cases arriving underprepared, evidence lost, disclosures of evidence not being made, victims made to feel marginalised and millions of pounds of public money wasted'".&lt;ref name="Hansard"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=22 March 2018 |title=Business of the House 22 March 2018 |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2018-03-22/debates/91186D84-6A9B-4436-84DB-AB02B51898B7/BusinessOfTheHouse |journal=Hansard |publication-place=London |volume=638 |at=column 395 |access-date=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suggestion was taken up by the Criminal Bar Association and Young Legal Aid Lawyers who launched a campaign "''Help us tell every MP criminal justice is in crisis''" to fund the provision of a copy of the book for every [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|Member of parliament]].&lt;ref name="CL&amp;J"/&gt; The target of £10,000 was reached in three days,&lt;ref name="CrowdJustice"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/the-law-is-broken/ |title=Help us tell every MP criminal justice is in crisis  |website=CrowdJustice |access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian3"/&gt; and it was reported that the book's publisher has pledged to match the donation.&lt;ref name="SLN"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scottishlegal.com/2018/04/04/secret-barrister-book-sent-mps/ |title=Scottish Legal News |date=4 April 2018 |access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Critical reception==

In the week after its publication in March 2018 the book was placed at number 14 in Amazon's top 20 bestsellers list and reached the Sunday Times top five.&lt;ref name="Guardian3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/apr/01/all-mps-to-be-sent-secret-barrister-book-after-campaign?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other |title=All MPs to be sent Secret Barrister book after campaign: Mystery author’s surprise bestseller reveals ‘the reality of criminal justice at the coalface’ |last=Summers |first=Hannah |date=1 April 2018 |website=The Guardian |access-date=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained in the Sunday Times Top 10 Bestsellers list for twenty-four weeks.&lt;ref name="STBestsellers"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Sunday Times Bestsellers: General Hardbacks|last=|first=|date=9 September 2018|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=|at=Culture section: books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reception of professional book reviewers was uniformly positive.

Writing in ''[[The Observer]]'', Alexander Larman called the book "terrifying and occasionally hilarious", an eye-opening if depressing account of the practice of law today. The Secret Barrister paints a picture of chaos in the courts, "from trials being endlessly postponed to unprepared barristers struggling through an underfunded and unfit system ... The author leaves us in no doubt that urgent reform is needed".&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/25/self-and-i-the-party-the-secret-barrister-de-abaitua-ellizabeth-day-review |title=The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How It’s Broken |last=Larman |first=Alexander |date=25 March 2018 |website=The Guardian |access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hannah Summers, in ''The Guardian'', noted that the author paints a damning picture of a legal system in which violent abusers walk free because evidence has gone missing and in which lawyers do hours of unpaid work to keep the system from collapse. According to the author, "the courts in England and Wales have been brought to their knees by government cuts and left so plagued by daily errors they are no longer fit for purpose".&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/mar/18/barrister-blows-whistle-on-broken-law-brought-to-its-knees-by-cuts |title=Barrister blows whistle on 'broken legal system brought to its knees by cuts' |last=Summers |first=Hannah |date=18 March 2018 |website=The Guardian |access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''[[The Times]]'', Imran Mahmood called the book both a lament and a celebration, carrying a message that is delivered with great skill. In reading it, he confessed to being surprised again and again at how damaged the criminal system is. The book tells us that "the liberty of the individual depends on us regarding the justice system as not just for criminals and victims but for all of us — it is the symbol of our nation’s humanity".&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/review-the-secret-barrister-stories-of-the-law-and-how-its-broken-justice-hangs-in-the-balance-kr2pfdzts |title=Review: The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How it’s Broken — justice hangs in the balance |last=Mahmood |first=Imran |date=24 March 2018 |website=The Times |access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is "a devastating indictment", said [[Daniel Finkelstein]], "telling tale after tale of cases that are not prosecuted properly and are not tried properly".&lt;ref name="Finkelstein"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/it-will-take-money-to-mend-criminal-justice-h5nv25kmv |title=It will take money to mend criminal justice |last=Finkelstein |first=Daniel |date=11 April 2018 |website=The Times |access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Bates of the ''[[Literary Review]]'' called the book "a truly shocking account of the working of the English courts today". Fluently and engagingly written by an anonymous junior criminal barrister, the book tells of underfunded, dilapidated buildings, ever-lengthening trial delays and miscarriages of justice. Bates noted that "in a staggering 87 per cent of cases" audit trails show the disclosure of evidence to defence lawyers from the police or by the hassled, overworked and understaffed [[Crown Prosecution Service]] to be unsatisfactory.&lt;ref name="Literary Review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://literaryreview.co.uk/court-in-the-crossfire |title=Court in the Crossfire |last=Bates |first=Stephen |date=31 March 2018

In ''CL&amp;J Criminal Law and Justice Weekly'' Jon Robins wrote that the book "shines an unflinching light on the nightmare of our courts". Chronic underfunding, staggering inefficiency and a deathly managerialism is endemic in the system. Austerity has hit the criminal justice system hard, and the author makes clear just how dangerous a place the courts have become should you have the misfortune to end up there. That fate could happen to anyone, a thought that Robins considers "terrifying". He notes that the author lays bare the risk posed to all of us by a chronically underfunded justice system, politicians rarely having "to live with the consequences of their ill-thought out and occasionally cynical criminal justice policies".&lt;ref name="CL&amp;J"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Robins |first=Jon |title=The Secret Barrister - Stories of the Law and How It’s Broken |url=https://www.criminallawandjustice.co.uk/reviews/Secret-Barrister-Stories-Law-and-How-It%E2%80%99s-Broken |journal=CL&amp;J Criminal Justice and Law Weekly |volume=182 |issue=13 |access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Times'' publication ''The Brief'', Catherine Baksi called the book a rallying cry against short sighted governments and an apathetic public who luxuriate in the misplaced confidence that they will never be wrongly accused of a crime. The book's author sets out with clarity and eloquence in a dozen angry, passionate and frustrated chapters a damning verdict on a system "close to breaking point", and "lays bare the result of the wrong-headed, short-sighted, politically expedient and dishonest drive to prosecute and defend on the cheap". She cited the author's view that the inexcusable "bargain basement retail model of justice" is no more than "roulette framed as justice" where decisions are "inconsistent, irrational and, at times, plainly unlawful".&lt;ref name="TheBrief"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thetimesbrief.co.uk/users/39765-catherine-baksi/posts/31550-shocking-secrets-of-a-crumbling-criminal-justice-system |title=Secret Barrister sends SOS from crumbling criminal justice system |last=Baski |first=Catherine |date=23 March 2018 |website=The Times: The Brief |access-date=31 March 2018 |subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Theo Barclay set out for readers of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' the author's principal allegation: "that successive governments have neglected and wilfully abused what was the jewel in the crown of the British constitution. The verdict? Guilty as charged". He noted that "Day-in, day-out, the innocent are punished and the guilty walk free because the system is underfunded, neglected, and failing those for whom it was designed to work". He expressed hope that "this excellent book will ... raise awareness of what has been, until now, a silent crisis".&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{Cite news |title=The Criminal Neglect of Our Justice System |last=Barclay |first=Theo |date=14 April 2018 |work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[New Law Journal]]'' Chris Dale wrote that the book "make you hate politicians", pointing out that the conditions described are the result of decisions which "are the product of more than just budget-cutting; ideology and ignorance play their part, along with a cynical calculation about who votes for what".&lt;ref name="NLJ"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dale |first=Chris |title=Book review: Stories of the Law and How it’s Broken |url=https://www.newlawjournal.co.uk/content/book-review-stories-law-and-how-it-s-broken |journal=New Law Journal |publication-date=13 April 2018 |issue=7788 |page=22 |access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mary Cowe for ''Counsel'' magazine, "this book is no rant. It is passionate advocacy of the highest standard, with all the sweary asides you can’t say in court".&lt;ref name="Cowe"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Mary |last=Cowe |title=Book review: Stories of the Law and How It’s Broken by The Secret Barrister  |url=https://www.counselmagazine.co.uk/articles/book-review-stories-of-the-law-and-how-it%E2%80%99s-broken-the-secret-barrister |journal=Counsel magazine |publisher=LexisNexis; Butterworths |publication-date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thatching''' is the craft of building a [[roof]] with dry vegetation such as [[straw]], [[Phragmites|water reed]], [[Cyperaceae|sedge]] (''[[Cladium mariscus]]''), [[Juncus|rushes]], [[Calluna|heather]], or [[palm branch]]es, layering the vegetation so as to shed water away from the inner roof. Since the bulk of the vegetation stays dry and is densely packed—trapping air—thatching also functions as insulation. It is a very old roofing method and has been used in both [[tropical]] and [[temperate climates]]. Thatch is still employed by builders in developing countries, usually with low-cost local vegetation. By contrast, in some developed countries it is  the choice of some affluent people who desire a rustic look for their home, would like a more ecologically friendly roof, or who have purchased an originally thatched abode.

==History==
Thatching methods have traditionally been passed down from generation to generation, and numerous descriptions of the materials and methods used in [[Europe]] over the past three centuries survive in archives and early publications.
[[File:Thatch C8248 Stretton on Fosse.jpg|thumb|Thatched roof, England]]
In some equatorial countries, thatch is the prevalent local material for [[roof]]s, and often [[wall]]s. There are diverse building techniques from the [[ancient Hawaiian]] ''hale'' shelter made from the local [[Cordyline fruticosa|ti leaves]] (''Cordyline fruticosa''), [[lauhala]] (''Pandanus tectorius'') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Lex AJ | last1 = Thomson | first2 = Lois | last2 = Englberger | first3 = Luigi | last3 = Guarino | first4 = RR | last4 = Thaman | first5 = Craig R | last5 = Elevitch | year = 2006 | chapter = Pandanus tectorius (''Pandanus'') | edition = 1.1 | editor-first = Craig R | editor-last = Elevitch | title = Species Profiles for Pacific Island Agroforestry | publisher = Permanent Agriculture Resources (PAR) | location = Hōlualoa, [[Hawai‘i|HI]] | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.agroforestry.net/tti/P.tectorius-pandanus.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121021015441/http://www.agroforestry.net/tti/P.tectorius-pandanus.pdf | archivedate = 2012-10-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Heteropogon contortus|pili grass]] (''Heteropogon contortus'').
[[File:PrayerAtBesakih.jpg|thumb|right|The multi-tiered [[Meru tower]]s of [[Besakih]] temple, [[Bali]], uses black ''[[Arenga pinnata|ijuk]]'' fibres.]]
Palm leaves are also often used. For example, in Na Bure, [[Fiji]], thatchers combine fan palm leave roofs with layered reed walls. Feathered palm leaf roofs are used in Dominica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hawaiianthatch.com/index-3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140201101759/http://hawaiianthatch.com/index-3.html |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Imperata cylindrica|Alang-alang]] (''Imperata cylindrica'') thatched roofs are used in Hawaii and [[Bali]]. In Southeast Asia, mangrove [[Nypa fruticans|nipa palm]] leaves are used as thatched roof material known as [[attap dwelling]]. In Bali, [[Indonesia]], the black fibres of [[Arenga pinnata]] called ''ijuk'' is also used as thatched roof materials, usually used in [[Balinese temple]] roof and meru towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Indonesian Town Revisited, Volume 1 of Southeast Asian dynamics | author = Peter J.

Wild vegetation such as water reed (''Phragmites australis''), bulrush/cat tail (''Typha'' spp.), broom (''Cytisus scoparius''), heather (''Calluna vulgaris''), and rushes (''Juncus'' spp. and ''Schoenoplectus lacustris'') was probably used to cover shelters and primitive dwellings in Europe in the late Palaeolithic period, but so far no direct archaeological evidence for this has been recovered. People probably began to use straw in the Neolithic period when they first grew cereals—but once again, no direct archaeological evidence of straw for thatching in Europe prior to the early medieval period survives.{{Sfn | Letts | 2000}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}

Many [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] people of the Americas, such as the former Maya civilization, Mesoamerica, the Inca empire, and the Triple Alliance (Aztec), lived in thatched buildings. It is common to spot thatched buildings in rural areas of the Yucatán Peninsula as well as many settlements in other parts of Latin America, which closely resemble the method of construction from distant ancestors. After the collapse of most extant American societies due to diseases introduced by Europeans, wars, enslavement, and genocide, the first Americans encountered by Europeans lived in structures roofed with bark or skin set in panels that could be added or removed for ventilation, heating, and cooling.  Evidence of the many complex buildings with fiber-based roofing material was not rediscovered until the early 2000s. French and British settlers built temporary thatched dwellings with local vegetation as soon as they arrived in New France and New England, but covered more permanent houses with wooden shingles.

[[File:Thatched Roof Cottage, Cotswolds, England (2016).jpg|thumb|Thatched Roof Cottage, Cotswolds, England (2016)]]

In most of England, thatch remained the only roofing material available to the bulk of the population in the countryside, in many towns and villages, until the late 1800s.&lt;ref name= "MoirLetts"&gt;{{Citation | first1 = J | last1 = Moir | first2 = John | last2 = Letts | title = Thatch: Thatching in England 1790–1940 | publisher = English Heritage | journal = Research Transactions | volume = 5 | year = 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Slate industry in Wales|Commercial production of Welsh slate]] began in 1820, and the mobility provided by [[canals]] and then [[railways]] made other materials readily available. Still, the number of thatched properties actually increased in the UK during the mid-1800s as agriculture expanded, but then declined again at the end of the 19th century because of agricultural recession and rural depopulation.  
[[File:Thatch stanton c 8333.jpg|thumb|Cottage with thatched roof in Stanton, a village in the Cotswolds, England]]
Gradually, thatch became a mark of poverty, and the number of thatched properties gradually declined, as did the number of professional thatchers. Thatch has become much more popular in the UK over the past 30 years, and is now a symbol of wealth rather than poverty. There are approximately 1,000 full-time thatchers at work in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Letts | first = John | edition = unpublished | title = Survey | year = 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and thatching is becoming popular again because of the renewed interest in preserving historic buildings and using more sustainable building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/magical-thatched-homes-that-will-enchant-you/ss-BBIRVia#image=21|title=Magical thatched homes that will enchant you|author=|date=|website=www.msn.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402035458/http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/magical-thatched-homes-that-will-enchant-you/ss-BBIRVia#image=21|archivedate=2 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although thatch is popular in Germany, The Netherlands, Denmark, parts of France, Sicily, Belgium and Ireland, there are more thatched roofs in the [[United Kingdom]] than in any other European country.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2014}} Good quality straw thatch can last for more than 50 years when applied by a skilled thatcher. Traditionally, a new layer of straw was simply applied over the weathered surface, and this "spar coating" tradition has created accumulations of thatch over 7’ (2.1&amp;nbsp;m) thick on very old buildings. The straw is bundled into "yelms" before it is taken up to the roof and then is attached using staples, known as "spars", made from twisted hazel sticks. Over 250 roofs in Southern England have base coats of thatch that were applied over 500 years ago, providing direct evidence of the types of materials that were used for thatching in the medieval period.{{Sfn | Letts | 2000}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}  Almost all of these roofs are thatched with wheat, rye, or a "maslin" mixture of both.  Medieval wheat grew to almost {{convert |6|ft}} tall in very poor soils and produced durable straw for the roof and grain for baking bread.

Technological change in the [[farming]] [[industry]] significantly affected the popularity of thatching. The availability of good quality thatching straw declined in England after the introduction of the combine harvester in the late 1930s and 1940s, and the release of short-stemmed wheat varieties. Increasing use of nitrogen fertiliser in the 1960s–70s also weakened straw and reduced its longevity. Since the 1980s, however, there has been a big increase in straw quality as specialist growers have returned to growing older, tall-stemmed, "heritage" varieties of wheat such as Squareheads Master (1880), N59 (1959), Rampton Rivet (1937), Victor (1910) and April Bearded (early 1800s)] in low input/organic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Letts | first = John | year = 2007 | title = Growing Straw for Thatching: a guide | publisher = The COHT (Conservation of Historic Thatch Committee}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK it is illegal under the [[Plant Variety and Seeds Act 1964]] (with many amendments) for an individual or organisation to give, trade or sell seed of an older variety of wheat (or any other agricultural crop) to a third party for growing purposes, subject to a significant fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Legislation | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1964/14 | year = 1964 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111202021/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1964/14 | archivedate = 2012-01-11 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this legislation, thatchers in the UK can no longer obtain top quality thatching straw grown from traditional, tall-stemmed varieties of wheat.

All evidence indicates that water reed was rarely used for thatching outside of East Anglia.&lt;ref name= "MoirLetts"/&gt; It has traditionally been a "one coat" material applied in a similar way to how it is used in continental Europe. Weathered reed is usually stripped and replaced by a new layer. It takes 4–5 acres of well-managed reed bed to produce enough reed to thatch an average house, and large reed beds have been uncommon in most of England since the Anglo-Saxon period. Over 80% of the water reed used in the UK is now imported from [[Turkey]], [[Eastern Europe]], China and South Africa. Though water reed might last for 50 years or more on a steep roof in a dry climate, modern imported water reed on an average roof in England does not last any longer than good quality wheat straw. The lifespan of a thatched roof also depends on the skill of the thatcher, but other factors must be considered—such as [[climate]], quality of materials, and the roof pitch.

In areas where [[Arecaceae|palms]] are abundant, palm leaves are used to thatch walls and roofs. Many species of palm trees are called "[[thatch palm]]", or have "thatch" as part of their common names. In the [[southeastern United States]], Native and pioneer houses were often constructed of [[Arecaceae|palmetto]]-leaf thatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor1-last = Andrews | editor1-first = Charles Mclean | editor2-last = Andrews | editor2-first = Evangeline Walker | origyear = 1945 | title = Jonathan Dickinson's Journal or, God's Protecting Providence.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 1.jpg|The creativity that comes with mud housing in rural areas is largely in the art of its roofing, of crafting thatch. As poor areas develop, newer ways of doing things have arrived: faster, more reliable, more durable ways. Houses are now being raised with modern materials, and even the ones standing still in traditional clay and thatch are being refurbished with the fashionable cement blocks/metal roofing sheets. This progression has no doubt brought about a decline in the practice of traditional crafts such as thatching.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 2.jpg|Mr. Bassey Ekpenyong, an indigene of Ito community in Cross-River state, Nigeria, calls me his friend in that manner that, as a stranger serving in his community under the National Youth Service Corp, makes me feel safe. He invites me to his shop during evening hours, and as he offers me roasted nuts, he makes a new promise to take me on his bike to the beach when the rains have stopped and the roads are accessible again.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 3.jpg|It is on my return to Ito after a couple of weeks away that I first see him seated in the shade outside of his shop, palm leaves littered all over. He sees the excitement register on my face as I pass on my bike and signals that I return, as if to say, "I have been waiting for you." And truly, he has.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 4.jpg|He is making a new roof for his shop, he tells me. He wants me to make pictures. There are palm leaves all over, some tied up in a bunch, some lying underneath the sun, others thatched already and staked up in a pile. In his hands are two long, thinly carved sticks that would function as the skeletal frame for a pair of thatch.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 5.jpg|He begins a new pair and laughs as he talks; a satisfaction comes with the knowledge that he is creating for me yet another experience to take home when service is over. He makes a joke of it.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 6.jpg|He folds a leaf in half neatly across both sticks. He does the same for another leaf, lapping it with the previous; then, using another tiny stick which he breaks afterwards, pins the leaves firmly in place.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 7.jpg|The process continues until the sticks are fully covered in green palm leaves. He completes a pair of thatch in minutes and begins another.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 8.jpg|Mr. Bassey is a conversationalist. He talks about the need for this change, a practice he does every five years as this is the durability period for the thatch. "Nfok nkaya," he says in Efik, pointing to his shop behind: mud house with mat (thatch). He points to other houses around, including the ones made of clay but with metal roofing sheets, and calls them "Ikanga": zinc dey up.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 10.jpg|They craft at the same pace, with the same measure of skill, but what intrigues me the most is their fellowship in that shared space, a communion of banter and silence. How silence descends on them as they craft, only to be broken yet again with a thought, a story, a sigh—childhood friends who had all grown up in this same space and carried within themselves different experiences as they each sorted life out; some leaving only to return yet again.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 11.jpg|Childhood friends thatching through time, memories into their palms, pinning them into that place of recollection, of regret, of conquests. Pinning them with the same laughter and voices that survived time.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 12.jpg|When asked how and when they had learnt thatching, the story is the same for everyone. They throw back to a time when they were just kids, when Ito was only made of the traditional mud houses.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 13.jpg|As kids, they had been taken along with other kids by the contractor, an older member of the community who dealt in sales of thatch, to the beach. There, they had each been assigned to a bunch of palm leaves, and had made dozens of thatch. This contractor in return had provided their meal for the day and bought them treats. Afterwards, he had also paid their mothers for the children's work; money meant for their upkeep.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 14.jpg|"We just sabi," Mr. Bassey tells me, explaining to me how he couldn't really pinpoint exactly how he had learnt. In a society where almost everything used was hand-crafted, most of these skills children grew into, got used to just by seeing them done on a daily basis, just by being a part of the home/society.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 15.jpg|"Those wen no sabi wen we go beach go just sidon look those wen sabi, or, watch contractor do am and dem go sabi."

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 16.jpg|To Mr. Bassey this is more. It carries sentiments enough for him to brag about the metal roofing sheets he's kept lying waste in his house for years. When the few thatched houses left have been broken down and then raised up in modern fashion, he still sits outside of his shop underneath the tree every five years, matting green leaves into thatch.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 17.jpg|His shop, once his home, carries for him memories of events: of childhood adventures; of leaving and returning; of his late wife, of loss. Memories that make him. And thatching, this craft, this practice of maintenance is, in a fast-paced world, for him the very means through which he holds time in his hands. The very means to which he laps these memories into a place of remembrance. The very means in which he shelters them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Maintenance in temperate climates==
[[File:Old-sanrizuka-goryou-farm,old-house-for-honored-guests,narita-city,japan.JPG|thumb|Thatched roof in [[Narita, Chiba|Narita]], [[Japan]].]]
Good thatch does not require frequent maintenance. In England a ridge normally lasts 8–14 years, and re-ridging is required several times during the lifespan of a thatch. Experts no longer recommend covering thatch with wire netting, as this slows evaporation and reduces longevity. [[Moss]] can be a problem if very thick, but is not usually detrimental, and many species of moss are actually protective. {{Citation | title = The Thatcher's Craft | year = 1960}}, remains the most widely used reference book on the techniques used for thatching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.hct.ac.uk/Downloads/cp_thatch.html | publisher = HCT | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | title = Thatch | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111063005/http://www.hct.ac.uk/Downloads/cp_thatch.html | archivedate = 2012-01-11 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The thickness of a layer of thatch decreases over time as the surface gradually turns to compost and is blown off the roof by wind and rain. Thatched roofs generally needs replacement when the horizontal wooden 'sways' and hair-pin 'spars', also known as 'gads' (twisted hazel staples) that fix each course become visible near the surface. It is not total depth of the thatch within a new layer applied to a new roof that determines its longevity, but rather how much weathering thatch covers the fixings of each overlapping course. “A roof is as good as the amount of correctly laid thatch covering the fixings.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.eamta.co.uk/ | title = The Thatch &amp; Thatching | publisher = The East Anglia Master Thatchers Association | place = UK | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831101444/http://www.eamta.co.uk/ | archivedate = 2011-08-31 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flammability ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
[[Image:House river kwai.jpg|thumb|right|River houses on the [[Khwae Noi River|River Kwai]].]]
Thatch is not as flammable as many people believe. It burns slowly, "like a closed book," thatchers say. The vast majority of fires are linked to the use of wood burners and faulty chimneys with degraded or poorly installed or maintained flues. Sparks from paper or burned rubbish can ignite dry thatch on the surface around a chimney. Fires can also begin when sparks or flames work their way through a degraded chimney and ignite the surrounding semi-charred thatch. This can be avoided by ensuring that the chimney is in good condition, which may involve stripping thatch immediately surrounding the chimney to the full depth of the stack. This can easily be done without stripping thatch over the entire roof. Insurance premiums on thatched houses are higher than average in part because of the perception that thatched roofs are a fire hazard, but also because a thatch fire can cause extensive smoke damage and a thatched roof is more expensive to replace than a standard tiled or slate roof. Workmen should never use open flame near thatch, and nothing should be burnt that could fly up the chimney and ignite the surface of the thatch. [[Spark arrestor]]s usually cause more harm than good, as they are easily blocked and reduce air flow. All thatched roofs should have smoke detectors in the roof space. Spray-on fire retardant or pressure impregnated fire retardants can reduce the spread of flame and radiated heat output.

On new buildings, a solid fire retardant barrier over the rafters can make the thatch sacrificial in case of fire. If fireboards are used, they require a ventilation gap between boarding and thatch so that the roof can breathe, as condensation can be a significant problem in thin, single layer thatch. Condensation is much less of a problem on thick straw roofs, which also provide much better insulation since they do not need to be ventilated.

==Performance==
[[Image:Kodaiji-2002-0098.jpg|thumb|Ihōan, a tea house at [[Kōdai-ji]] in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]].]]
The performance of thatch depends on roof shape and design, pitch of roof, position—its [[geography]] and [[topography]]—the quality of material and the expertise of the thatcher.

Thatch has some natural properties that are advantageous to its performance. It is naturally weather-resistant, and when properly maintained does not absorb a lot of water. There should not be a significant increase to roof weight due to water retention. A roof pitch of at least 50 degrees allows precipitation to travel quickly down slope so that it runs off the roof before it can penetrate the structure.

Thatch is also a natural insulator, and air pockets within straw thatch insulate a building in both warm and cold weather. A thatched roof ensures that a building is cool in summer and warm in winter.

Thatch also has very good resistance to wind damage when applied correctly.

===Advantages===
Thatching materials range from plains grasses to waterproof leaves found in equatorial regions. It is the most common roofing material in the world, because the materials are readily available.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}
[[Image:Partially thatched roof.jpg|thumb|right|Farm-house in the [[Netherlands]] near [[Alkmaar]]. The combination of thatch and [[roof tiles]] is quite common in that area.]]
Because thatch is lighter, less timber is required in the roof that supports it.

Thatch is a versatile material when it comes to covering irregular roof structures. This fact lends itself to the use of second-hand, [[recycled]] and natural materials that are not only more [[sustainable]], but need not fit exact standard dimensions to perform well.

===Disadvantages===
Thatched houses are harder to insure because of the perceived fire risk, and because thatching is labor-intensive, it is much more expensive to thatch a roof than to cover it with slate or tiles. Birds can damage a roof while they are foraging for grubs, and rodents are attracted by residual grain in straw.

[[Image:Lucy in the sky.jpg|thumb|right|Thatched hut in [[Lesotho]].]]
Thatch has fallen out of favor in much of the industrialized world not because of fire, but because thatching has become very expensive and alternative 'hard' materials are cheaper—but this situation is slowly changing. There are about 60,000 thatched roofs in the UK, of which 50–80 suffer a serious fire each year, most of these being completely destroyed. The cost to the Fire Brigade is £1.3m per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more thatched roofs are being built every year.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

New thatched roofs were forbidden in London in 1212 following a major fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/community/cmfabr08.html|title=Florilegium urbanum - Physical fabric - Regulations for building construction and fire safety |date=|website=users.trytel.com|accessdate=6 May 2018 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026234132/http://users.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/community/cmfabr08.html |archivedate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and existing roofs had to have their surfaces plastered to reduce the risk of fire. The modern [[Shakespeare's Globe|Globe Theatre]] is one of the few thatched buildings in London (others can be found in the suburb of [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]]), but the Globe's modern, water reed thatch is purely for decorative purpose and actually lies over a fully waterproofed roof built with modern materials. The Globe Theatre, opened in 1997, was modelled on the Rose, which was destroyed by a fire on a dry June night in 1613 when a burning wad of cloth ejected from a special effects cannon during a performance set light to the surface of the thatch. The original Rose Theatre was actually thatched with cereal straw, a sample of which was recovered by Museum of London archaeologists during the excavation of the site in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John | last = Letts | title = Unpublished photos and sample records}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim thatch cannot cope with regular snowfall but, as with all roofing materials, this depends on the strength of the underlying roof structure and the pitch of the surface. A law passed in 1640 in [[Massachusetts]] outlawed the use of thatched roofs in the colony for this reason. Thatch is lighter than most other roofing materials, typically around {{convert|7|lb/sqft|abbr=on}}, so the roof supporting it does not need to be so heavily constructed, but if snow accumulates on a lightly constructed thatched roof, it could collapse. A thatched roof is usually pitched between 45–55 degrees and under normal circumstances this is sufficient to shed snow and water. In areas of extreme snowfall, such as [[Minka#Roofing|parts of Japan]], the pitch is increased further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.addictedtotravel.com/holidays/snow-country|title=Winter Japan at its Best|publisher=Addicted to Travel|accessdate=7 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328175612/http://www.addictedtotravel.com/holidays/snow-country|archivedate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some thatched roofs in the UK are extremely old and preserve evidence of traditional materials and methods that have long since been lost. In northern Britain this evidence is often preserved beneath corrugated sheet materials and frequently come to light during the development of smaller rural properties. [[Historic Scotland]] have funded several research projects into thatching techniques and these have revealed a wide range of materials including broom, heather, rushes, cereals, bracken, turf and clay and highlighted significant regional variation &lt;ref&gt;Walker, B, McGregor, C.&amp; Stark, G  1996  Thatches and Thatching Techniques: A guide to conserving Scottish Thatching Traditions.

{{About|the Scientology facility||The Hole (disambiguation)}}
[[File:The Hole Gold Base.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|The Hole at Gold Base (also known as Int Base) at Gilman Hot Springs, California]]
'''The Hole''' is the unofficial nickname of a facility operated by the [[Church of Scientology]] on [[Gold Base]], which is also known as '''Int Base'''.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Lawrence (February 14, 2011). [http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology/scientology-defectors-describe-violence-humiliation-in-the-hole/1270047 "The Apostate: Paul Haggis v. The Church of Scientology"]. ''The New Yorker'' (''Tampa Bay Times''). Retrieved February 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of its senior executives have reportedly been confined within the building for months or years. It consists of a set of [[double-wide trailer]]s within a Scientology compound, joined together to form a suite of offices which were formerly used by the Church's international management team. According to former members of the Church of Scientology and media reports, from 2004 the Church's leader [[David Miscavige]] sent dozens of senior Scientology executives to the Hole. The ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' described it in a January 2013 article as:

{{quote|a place of confinement and humiliation where Scientology's management culture&amp;nbsp;— always demanding&amp;nbsp;— grew extreme. Inside, a who's who of Scientology leadership went at each other with brutal tongue lashings, and even hands and fists. They intimidated each other into crawling on their knees and standing in trash cans and confessing to things they hadn't done. They lived in degrading conditions, eating and sleeping in cramped spaces designed for office use.&lt;ref name="Defectors" /&gt;}}

The executives confined at the Hole are reported to have numbered up to 100 of the most senior figures in Scientology's management, including the Church of Scientology International's President, [[Heber Jentzsch]]. Individuals are said to have spent months or even years there. After a few managed to escape the Hole and Scientology, they gave accounts of their experiences to the media, the courts and the [[FBI]], leading to widespread publicity about the harsh conditions that they had allegedly endured. The Church of Scientology has denied those accounts. It says that "the Hole does not exist and never has" and states that nobody had been held against their will.&lt;ref name="Defectors" /&gt; However, it acknowledges that its members are subjected to "[[Scientology Justice|religious discipline]], a program of ethics and correction entered into voluntarily as part of their religious  observances."&lt;ref name="PR Crisis" /&gt; It has been described by ex-members comparable to that of a [[North Korea|North Korean]] death camp.&lt;ref name="PR Crisis" /&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Gold Base map.png|right|thumb|Map of Gold Base. The location of the Hole is marked as "SP Hole" near the top left of the map.]]
{{main|Gold Base}}
The facility known as the Hole is located on the Church of Scientology's [[Gold Base]], built on the site of a resort called Gilman Hot Springs in the California town of San Jacinto. The base covers {{convert|520|acre}} bisected by a public highway, Gilman Springs Road, just off [[California State Route 79]]. It was secretly acquired by the Church of Scientology in 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atack|1990|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the alias of the "Scottish Highland Quietude Club".&lt;ref name="Wright 2013 175"&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2013|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church established a secret base there which was staffed by members of the [[Sea Org]], an inner core of Scientologists which is said to number some five to seven thousand people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bromley|2009|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now two Sea Org bases in the compound: Gold, which houses the Church's in-house film studio [[Golden Era Productions]], and Int, the Church's international headquarters, though in practice the whole site is usually called Gold Base.&lt;ref name="Wright 2013 175"/&gt;

Members of the Sea Org are subject to a rigid code of discipline known as "[[Ethics (Scientology)|Scientology Ethics]]" which is enforced by Ethics Officers. Scientologists are encouraged to look out for any fellow members violating Ethics and to submit "Knowledge Reports" on any violations they spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atack|1990|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Ethics are violated, a "trial" by a Committee of Evidence can lead to punishments administered by a body called the [[Rehabilitation Project Force]] (RPF). Such punishments, which can last for months or years, typically consist of a regime of physical labor and lengthy daily confessions of "evil purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kent|2001a|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such assignments can also be received for performing work poorly, showing negative personality indicators (doubts, hostility etc.) or causing trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kent|2001b|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals assigned in this way are kept isolated and prohibited from having contact with other members of the Church of Scientology and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kent|2001b|page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Marc and Claire Headley, two Scientologists who left the Church in 2005, residents at the base are not permitted to leave without the permission of a supervisor and have to work at least 16 hours a day, from 8 am to past midnight, with shorter hours on Sundays and little time for socialising. Communications with the outside world are effectively cut off; cellphones and Internet access are generally banned, mail is censored and passports are kept in a locked filing cabinet. The perimeter of the base is closely guarded around the clock. It is ringed with high fences that are topped with spikes and razor wire and monitored by inward-facing motion sensors to detect anyone trying to climb out of the compound. The ''Tampa Bay Times'' reported that dozens of workers tried to escape from the base&amp;nbsp;– some of them repeatedly&amp;nbsp;– but were caught and returned by Sea Org "pursuit teams". The escapees are said to have been subjected to isolation, interrogation and punishment on their return to the compound.&lt;ref name="FBI"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Childs|first1=Joe|last2=Tobin|first2=Thomas C.|title=FBI's Scientology investigation: Balancing the First Amendment with charges of abuse and forced labor|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology/fbis-scientology-investigation-balancing-the-first-amendment-with-charges/1270036|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the Hole==
[[File:David Miscavige - Portrait.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[David Miscavige]], the current leader of the Church of Scientology]]
Defectors from the Church say that from around 2002, Scientology leader [[David Miscavige]] began to publicly slap, kick, punch or shove executives at the base who had angered him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reitman|2011|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Brousseau, the estate manager at Gold Base and a veteran Sea Org member, said that Miscavige repeatedly faulted his subordinates' work, "constantly berating them, nitpicking everything they're doing, pointing out inadequacies, ineffectiveness, lack of results, blaming it all on them and their inability to do anything right, and on the other hand saying how he's got to do everything himself&amp;nbsp;– he's the only one who can do anything right."&lt;ref name="Ex-Scientologists"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Childs |first1=Joe |last2=Tobin |first2=Thomas C. |title=Ex-Scientologists Describe "The Hole" |url=http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2009/reports/project/ |work=Tampa Bay Times |date=January 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114150923/http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2009/reports/project/ |archivedate=January 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; High-level meetings became tense affairs punctuated by "profane, belittling rants".&lt;ref name="Defectors"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientology defectors describe violence, humiliation in "the Hole"|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology/scientology-defectors-describe-violence-humiliation-in-the-hole/1270047|last1=Tobin|first1=Thomas C|last2=Childs|first2=Joe|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to emails said to have come from Miscavige's "Communicator"&amp;nbsp;– the personal assistant responsible for passing on transcribed messages from the leader&amp;nbsp;– he routinely berated subordinates with terms such as "CSMF" (meaning "Cock-sucking motherfucker")&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sweeney|2013|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "YSCOHB" (meaning "You suck cock on Hollywood Boulevard").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sweeney|2013|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A practice called "overboarding" was reintroduced as a further method of enforcing discipline on the base. It had been devised during the 1960s when Scientology's founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] was living aboard a former Irish Sea cattle ferry ''Royal Scotman'' [''sic''] (later ''Apollo''), in which he roamed the Mediterranean at the head of a small fleet of ships crewed by Sea Org members. In response to perceived violations, Scientologists were thrown over the side of the ship; sometimes they were bound and blindfolded before being tossed overboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atack|1990|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology spokesmen describe the practice as "a Sea Org ritual akin to traditions in other religious orders" and "part of ecclesiastical justice."&lt;ref name="Ecclesiastical"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tobin|first1=Thomas C|last2=Childs|first2=Joe|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology/scientology-ecclesiastical-justice-part-3-of-3-in-a-special-report-on-the/1012575|title=Scientology: Ecclesiastical justice|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some Scientology churches (or "orgs") adopted a land-based version of overboarding by making staff members stand against a wall while other Scientologists threw buckets of water at them, but the practice was largely abandoned in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reitman|2011|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author Janet Reitman, Miscavige reintroduced it in the 2000s and ordered dozens of senior executives to go out of doors in the middle of the night and assemble at the base's swimming pool or its muddy lake. They would then jump or be pushed into the water, often in freezing conditions, while fully clothed and with Miscavige watching.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reitman|2011|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church acknowledges that overboarding took place but characterises it as part of its "ecclesiastical justice" system for dealing with poor performance.&lt;ref name="Ecclesiastical" /&gt;

According to Janet Reitman, in the late fall of 2004 Miscavige called together 70 senior Church executives in a pair of double-wide trailers normally used as the international management team's offices. They were ordered to play a game of [[musical chairs]] in the management conference room. Those who failed to get a chair when the music stopped would be "offloaded" from the base to be sent away from their spouses and children to languish in the most remote and unpleasant locations in Scientology's empire. As Queen's ''[[Greatest Hits (Queen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' was played, the competition for seats became increasingly fierce: "By the time the number had dwindled to twenty, people were throwing one another against the walls, ripping seats from one another's hands, wrestling one another to the floor."&lt;ref name="Reitman339" /&gt; At the end of the contest, Miscavige ordered that all the executives were to stay in the conference room and sleep under the tables until further notice. They stayed there for the next few days, with occasional deliveries of food, before being released.&lt;ref name="Reitman339"&gt;{{harvnb|Reitman|2011|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church's then chief spokesman, Tommy Davis, has acknowledged that the "musical chairs" incident occurred and says that it was "intended to demonstrate how disruptive wholesale changes could be on an organization" but dismisses the accounts of threats and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2013|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2004, according to Reitman, a purge was carried out of staff at the base. Hundreds were sent to the RPF while dozens of others were offloaded and expelled from the Sea Org with huge "freeloader bills" presented to them for the Church services they had received over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reitman|2011|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of senior executives were accused of being "[[suppressive person]]s". They were said to have been confined in the management team offices and ordered to carry out the "A to E steps", a set of penances intended to demonstrate that they had repented of their "crimes" and reformed. In particular, they were to confess and identify which of them were "defying [Miscavige] and sabotaging Scientology with their incompetence".&lt;ref name="Defectors" /&gt; The management offices, which had formerly been referred to as "the CMO Int trailer", became known as the "A to E Room," the "SP Hole," and ultimately simply "the Hole."&lt;ref name="Concentration"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/08/scientology_concentration_camp_the_hole.php|title=Scientology's Concentration Camp for Its Executives: The Prisoners, Past and Present|last=Ortega|first=Tony|date=August 2, 2012|work=The Village Voice|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407055834/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/08/scientology_concentration_camp_the_hole.php|archivedate=April 7, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in the Hole==
[[File:The Hole aerial view.jpg|right|thumb|Aerial view of the Hole ''(the white-roofed building in the center of the photo)''. The maintenance garage, where makeshift showers were set up for the confined executives, is visible at the bottom right across the road]]
From 2004 to 2007, the number of people confined in the Hole increased from 40 to up to 100. They slept in cots or sleeping bags, squeezed into every available floor space or on desktops. Men would sleep around the conference table while women slept in cubicles and small offices around the main conference room. They were so crowded that there was barely any room to move, according to one of those present: "Everyone sleeping with only about six inches on either side. Above you. Below you. Getting up in the middle of the night, you'd disturb everyone."&lt;ref name="Rinder" /&gt; They were only allowed to leave to attend Church events or to be taken to a shower in a nearby maintenance garage, to which they were taken two at a time under guard. Food was brought to them on golf carts from the Gold Base mess hall, as the executives were not allowed to eat with the rest of the staff, and they were only given ten to fifteen minutes to eat.&lt;ref name="Defectors" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecclesiastical" /&gt; According to one of the executives, the food was "like leftovers, slop, bits of meat, soupy kind of leftovers thrown into a pot and cooked and barely edible."&lt;ref name="PR Crisis" /&gt; The building was said to be infested with ants and on several occasions the electricity was turned off, causing the temperature inside to reach {{convert|106|F}} due to the lack of air conditioning.&lt;ref name="PR Crisis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/pr-crisis-scientology-abc-news-exclusive/story?id=15813613&amp;singlePage=true|title=Another PR Crisis for Scientology|last=Harris|first=Dan|work=ABC News|date=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Brousseau commented that when he visited the Hole occasionally, "you could smell that people live here, people sleep here."&lt;ref name="Ex-Scientologists" /&gt; He saw the executives being marched elsewhere on the base to take showers; his impression was that "they looked like they were being marched to the gallows&amp;nbsp;– they just looked lifeless, with no purpose. Very hang-dog, droopy shoulders, slouchy, very sad, inward-looking creatures."&lt;ref name="Ex-Scientologists" /&gt; He said that they were only allowed out "at certain times of day that would be adjudicated to be the least likely time when DM [Miscavige] would run into them if he was on the property. They would march out to Old Gilman House to take a shower and come back because they had no shower facilities inside the Hole. Later that got upgraded to let them go down to the garage."&lt;ref name="Outcasts"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2009/reports/project/ |title=Suppressed: John Brousseau&amp;nbsp;— Outcasts |last1=Tobin |first1=Thomas C |last2=Childs |first2=Joe |last3=Rivenbark |first3=Maurice |work=Tampa Bay Times |date=January 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114150923/http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2009/reports/project/ |archivedate=January 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes executives were allowed out for a short time to attend Church events, but many ended up spending months or even years in the Hole.&lt;ref name="Defectors" /&gt;

The individuals who were later named by the media as being held in the Hole represented a who's who of Scientology's top management. They included Debbie Cook, the head of the [[Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization]]; [[Heber Jentzsch]], the President of the [[Church of Scientology International]]; [[Guillaume Lesevre]], the Executive Director International and the church's top management official; [[Mark Rathbun]], the Inspector General of the [[Religious Technology Center]]; Wendell Reynolds, the International Finance Director; Mike Rinder, the Commanding Officer of the [[Office of Special Affairs]]; Norman Starkey, the former captain of Hubbard's ship, the ''Apollo''; and Marc Yager, the Commanding Officer of the [[Commodore's Messenger Organization]].&lt;ref name="Defectors" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Concentration" /&gt;

Executives who eventually escaped from the Hole have said that its occupants were forced to practice group confessions in which they would confess supposed transgressions against Miscavige, bad thoughts that they had had about Scientology and disclose their sexual fantasies.&lt;ref name="Ecclesiastical" /&gt; Debbie Cook, who spent seven weeks in the Hole in 2007, said that "most of the time the activities [in the Hole] were either you confessing your own sins or bad things that you'd done, or getting other people to confess theirs."&lt;ref name="PR Crisis" /&gt; Mike Rinder commented on the bizarre personal dynamics of the Hole: "These were your friends, people you had traveled with. But then, you get in the Hole? You can't trust anybody."&lt;ref name="Rinder"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/04/mike_rinder_scientology_former_spokesman_interview.php|title=Mike Rinder on "the Hole," Indoctrination, Confessions, and His Ultimate Escape|last=Ortega|first=Tony|work=The Village Voice|date=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rinder told the ''Tampa Bay Times'' that interrogations "would be carried out by whoever happened to be there&amp;nbsp;– 20 people, 30 people, 50 people, all standing up and screaming at you, and ultimately it sort of devolved into physical violence, torture, to extricate these 'confessions' out of people."&lt;ref name="Ex-Scientologists" /&gt; According to Rinder, the confessions were sometimes dictated by Miscavige, but more usually the inmates of the Hole would force each other to confess: "The 50 people there are all screaming at me, telling me I've got to confess&amp;nbsp;– I've done that, why don't I just admit it? I stole money, I had affairs&amp;nbsp;– people would just literally dream up bullshit and start screaming it out, and then the mob goes crazy: 'Oh yeah, it must have been that!'"&lt;ref name="Ex-Scientologists" /&gt; Tom De Vocht, who was also in the Hole, recalled that "everybody in that damned room&amp;nbsp;— people are wild and out of control, I punched somebody. Everybody was punched. And screaming and yelling. It just got like, 'What the hell is going on here?'"&lt;ref name="Ecclesiastical" /&gt; De Vocht rationalized his own involvement on the grounds of self-defense: "If I don't attack I'm going to be attacked. It's a survival instinct in a weird situation that no one should be in."&lt;ref name="Rundown"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology-the-truth-rundown-part-1-of-3-in-a-special-report-on-the/1012148|title=Scientology: The Truth Rundown|last1=Tobin|first1=Thomas C|last2=Childs|first2=Joe|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=June 21, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228093752/http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology-the-truth-rundown-part-1-of-3-in-a-special-report-on-the/1012148|archivedate=February 28, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pressure evidently worked, as Rinder wrote an "Apology and Announcement" on June 4, 2005 in which he told Miscavige, "I recognise very clearly how Treasonous I have been towards you and Scientology."&lt;ref name="Ex-Scientologists" /&gt; He subsequently commented that such written confessions "read like North Korean POW writeups,"&lt;ref name="Ex-Scientologists" /&gt; alluding to the way that [[Korean War POWs detained in North Korea]] were forced to go through [[Mind control#Korean War and the origin of brainwashing|brainwashing]] to renounce their "reactionary imperialist" mindset. He explained to the ''Tampa Bay Times'' why people did not simply walk out of the Hole: "If you leave you are going to lose contact with your family and any friends who are Scientologists. You have it pounded into you the whole time that the only reason someone leaves a group like that is because they are bad, that you have done something that force you to have to leave."&lt;ref name="Why they stay" /&gt; He noted people had invested a great deal of themselves in Scientology, that Sea Org members have "made a commitment beyond even a single lifetime" and that the prevailing attitude was that "'I've lived through many lifetimes and there are lots of experiences that I've had that are far worse than this, so I can put up with this and I can stand it'."&lt;ref name="Why they stay"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2009/reports/project/ |title=Suppressed: Mike Rinder&amp;nbsp;— Why they stay |last1=Tobin |first1=Thomas C |last2=Childs |first2=Joe |last3=Rivenbark |first3=Maurice |work=Tampa Bay Times |date=January 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114150923/http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2009/reports/project/ |archivedate=January 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

What was happening in the Hole took place out of view of the other staff members at Gold Base, but it was clear that it would not be a good thing to be sent there. According to Lawrence Wright, "the entire base became paralyzed with anxiety about being thrown into the Hole. People were desperately trying to police their thoughts, but it was difficult to keep secrets when staff members were constantly being security-checked with [[E-Meter]]s." Wright reports that David Miscavige's statements were transcribed for the executives in the Hole, who would then have to repeatedly read them out loud to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2013|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gold Base aerial view.jpg|right|thumb|Aerial view across Gold Base. The lake into which executives were reportedly "overboarded" in the middle of the night can be seen at the far left of the photo.]]
Former Church members have said that conditions in the Hole worsened in 2006 after several executives had escaped. Security was tightened to prevent the confined executives from "blowing". John Brousseau says that he was ordered to fasten steel bars across the doors of the building and the windows were modified so that they could only be opened a few inches. Another staff member objected, pointing out that any outsider could see the bars. They were removed after a few weeks, but the building was guarded around the clock to prevent further escapes.&lt;ref name="Defectors" /&gt; The Church of Scientology denies that bars were ever installed, saying, "Any allegation of bars being installed to hold people against their will is false and malicious and is denied."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology/church-of-scientology-responds-to-times-series-about-fbi-investigation/1270644|title=Church of Scientology responds to Times series about FBI investigation|last=Pouw|first=Karin|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2006, according to Rinder, executives undergoing "group confessions" were made to stand in big trash cans in the middle of the floor with signs around their necks on which various derogatory statements were written. Rinder described how it became "relatively routine" for people to be "slapped, punched, kicked, pushed, shoved, thrown up against the wall" in order to make them confess.&lt;ref name="Ex-Scientologists" /&gt; He told the ''Tampa Bay Times'' that he and other people were made to continuously crawl around a conference room table with their trouser legs rolled up, getting kicked from behind if they stopped, which resulted in them suffering severely contused and abraded knees after days of such treatment.&lt;ref name="Defectors" /&gt; There was an escalation in the level of confessions demanded, such that they became "more and more dramatic and over the top in order to be acceptable."&lt;ref name="Ex-Scientologists" /&gt; He described how one executive was made to sit under an air vent with the cooling system turned up high, while cold water was poured over his head. After an hour or so, he was "shaking so uncontrollably and his lips were so completely blue that he was incapable of talking".&lt;ref name="Ex-Scientologists" /&gt; (The executive in question denied to the ''Tampa Bay Times'' that this incident had ever happened).&lt;ref name="Defectors" /&gt;

Debbie Cook testified in a [[San Antonio]] court in 2012 that she had been on the phone to Miscavige when two Scientologists crawled in through her office window and seized her, conveying her to the Hole.&lt;ref name="Ex-Clearwater" /&gt; She said that she had subsequently been "put in a trash can, [had] cold water poured over [her], [and] slapped."&lt;ref name="PR Crisis" /&gt; According to Mark Rathbun, who was also in the Hole at the time, for twelve hours "Debbie was made to stand in a large garbage can and face one hundred people screaming at her demanding a confession as to her "homosexual tendencies". While this was going on, water was poured over her head. Signs were put around Debbie's neck, one marked in magic marker "LESBO" while this torture proceeded. Debbie was repeatedly slapped across the face by other women in the room during the interrogation. Debbie never did break."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/01/debbie_cook_scientology_enforcer_whistleblower_homophobia.php|title=Scientology in Crisis: Debbie Cook's Transformation from Enforcer to Whistleblower|last=Ortega|first=Tony|work=Village Voice|date=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook told the court that another Scientology executive, who had not been sent to the Hole, had objected to what he had seen there on a visit. According to Cook, the executive was given a two-hour beating and ordered to lick a bathroom floor for at least 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="Ex-Clearwater"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology/ex-clearwater-scientology-officer-debbie-cook-testifies-she-was-put-in-the/1214690|title=Ex-Clearwater Scientology officer Debbie Cook testifies she was put in 'the Hole,' abused for weeks|last1=Tobin|first1=Thomas C|last2=Childs|first2=Joe|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She testified that Marc Yager and Guillaume Lesevre, two of Scientology's most senior executives, were pressured to state that they had had a homosexual affair and were beaten until they "confessed".&lt;ref name="Concentration" /&gt; According to another executive, Tom De Vocht, Miscavige pushed Yager to the ground and told a black executive, "By the way, [Yager] thinks black people are niggers, and he doesn't want Scientology to help blacks. Go kick him.' So [Yager] is down on the ground and she's kicking him." Both Yager and the other executive have denied this account.&lt;ref name="Ecclesiastical" /&gt;

==Leaving the Hole==
[[File:Fence blades fgnd focus.jpg|right|thumb|The bladed fence at Gold Base, which Tom De Vocht scaled in May 2005 to escape from the compound]]
[[Mark Rathbun]] spent only four days in the Hole in 2004 but says that he left after seeing his old friend Tom De Vocht being physically beaten by Miscavige. According to Rathbun, one night the incarcerated executives were ordered to jog to a building 400 yards away and back. As they were herded back to their office-prison, he broke away and hid in bushes until the group had disappeared from sight. He retrieved his motorcycle, hid in the brush and drove out through the Gold Base gates when they were opened to let a car in.&lt;ref name="Ecclesiastical" /&gt; He subsequently rented a car and spent a month touring the South before settling in southern [[Texas]].&lt;ref name="Leaving"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology/leaving-the-church-of-scientology-a-huge-step/1012520|title=Leaving the Church of Scientology: a huge step|last1=Tobin|first1=Thomas C|last2=Childs|first2=Joe|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Vocht left Scientology in May 2005 after he was allegedly attacked by Miscavige. According to De Vocht, he told his wife&amp;nbsp;– a Miscavige aide&amp;nbsp;– that he would fight back if it happened again. He was subsequently declared to be a "Suppressive Person" and announced his intention to leave. The compound's guard refused to open the gate, so he climbed the fence and walked to [[Hemet, California|Hemet]], six miles away. He was later sent a $98,000 "Freeloader Bill" by the Church.&lt;ref name="Leaving" /&gt;

[[Mike Rinder]] spent almost two years in the Hole between 2004 and 2007, leaving it occasionally to deal with public relations matters such as dealing with the BBC journalist [[John Sweeney (journalist)|John Sweeney]]'s 2007 documentary ''[[Scientology and Me]]''. Rinder says that Miscavige was furious with the way that Sweeney had been handled and ordered Rinder to go to [[Sussex]] to dig ditches on a Church property there. He defected instead, eventually settling in [[Denver]].&lt;ref name="Leaving" /&gt;

Debbie Cook left the Hole in May 2007 after spending seven weeks there, when she was sent back to [[Clearwater, Florida]] to organize a major public event involving Miscavige. According to Cook, she was driven to downtown Clearwater by another staff member, along with her husband, to eat at the Church's dining hall. The couple took the opportunity to escape Scientology when the staff member went inside to get breakfast; Cook jumped into the driver's seat, drove with her husband to the nearest car rental outlet and hired a car to drive up to her father's house in [[North Carolina]]. Before they got there, they were intercepted by Church officials and ordered to return to Clearwater. She spent three weeks under guard, at one point writing in a letter to her mother that if she was not released she "would take whatever steps necessary, like slitting my wrists", before finally signing a severance agreement. She later said that by that point, "I would have signed that I stabbed babies over and over again and loved it".&lt;ref name="Ex-Clearwater" /&gt;

John Brousseau was not sent to the Hole, but what he saw of it made him decide to leave Scientology in 2010 after 33 years in the Church. He was struck by how "dozens of these people [in the Hole], they were just so alive, but I looked at them now and they were just husks. They wouldn't say or originate anything, they seemed to have no purpose, they were just like sheep. There's no way 100 people could be evil horrid [Suppressive Persons] and DM's the only [ethical] one. No way."&lt;ref name="Ex-Scientologists" /&gt; He had known and been friends with some of those in the Hole for decades and could not bear what he was seeing. As he put it, "I can't stop it, but I can at least stop supporting it. So I left."&lt;ref name="Defectors" /&gt; He left a note in his room for his colleagues to find: "By now you've noticed I'm gone. I couldn't stand to see my Sea Org friends so mistreated. I won't support it anymore. Goodbye."&lt;ref name="FBI" /&gt;

==Media exposure and legal inquiries==
[[File:Berthing Building Gold Base.jpg|right|thumb|Roadside view of the "Berthing" building at Gold Base, where executives in the Hole were reportedly allowed to sleep after the Hole was exposed by the media in 2009]]
From 2009, several former church executives began to speak out about the Hole, both to the media and to the [[FBI]]. Rathbun wrote in the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' in July 2012 that he had "decided that [he] had to speak out before someone was killed in the Hole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/church-scientology-inspector-general-marty-rathbun-explains-escaped-destructive-cult-katie-holmes-article-1.1106735|title=Former Church of Scientology inspector general Marty Rathbun explains how he escaped a destructive cult and what Katie Holmes is up against|last=Rathbun|first=Mark|date=July 2, 2012|work=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the ''Tampa Bay Times'' published a series of articles on the internal workings of the Church of Scientology titled "The Truth Rundown", detailing accounts of beatings and other episodes of violence between Miscavige and other top Scientology executives.&lt;ref name="Rundown" /&gt; The ''Times'' followed up in January 2013 with a detailed account of the Hole, supplemented by interviews with defectors from Scientology,&lt;ref name="Defectors" /&gt; while ''[[The Village Voice]]'' sought to compile a list of the executives said to have been incarcerated there.&lt;ref name="Concentration" /&gt; [[ABC News]] also reported on Debbie Cook's account of the Hole.&lt;ref name="PR Crisis" /&gt;

According to John Brousseau, the bad publicity led to reforms of the Hole. Its inmates were allowed to sleep in proper beds in the "Berthing" quarters elsewhere in the compound. Brousseau describes their new seven-days-a-week routine starting when "they got up, showered, then went to the dining hall at 9:30. They had 30 minutes for breakfast. Then they walked up to the Hole. They sat down at desks. I have no clue what work they did. They worked until 12:30 or 1 pm. Then they were marched back to the dining hall and had 30 minutes for lunch. Then they were marched back to the Hole and were there until 6 pm."&lt;ref name="Concentration" /&gt; After a 30-minute dinner, they were taken to the study hall and stayed there "for two and a half hours, until about 9:30. Then they went to the Hole again to wrap up their day. At 11 or midnight, they'd get marched back to Berthing."&lt;ref name="Concentration" /&gt; Some of the restrictions on contacting people outside the Hole were also said to have been eased. However, other Church staff were still encouraged to avoid contact with the inmates: "You didn't talk to them, you looked the other way, you'd leave the area if you saw them, it's like the black plague."&lt;ref name="Outcasts" /&gt; Brousseau commented: "You stayed away from these people. They're considered the worst of the worst."&lt;ref name="Concentration" /&gt;

Attempts by law enforcement to investigate conditions at Gold Base have been blocked by legal difficulties and the unwillingness of those on the base to talk to the police. According to Lawrence Wright, who wrote an account of the Hole in his 2013 book ''[[Going Clear (book)|Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief]]'', the [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]] sheriff's office has never received a complaint from someone at the base about their treatment there, despite the many accounts of mistreatment. Wright attributes this to the fear that many Scientologists have of bringing shame upon Scientology and of being forced to break off contact with their families and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kutnews.org/post/listen-austin-author-lawrence-wright-going-clear-his-controversial-book-scientology|title=Listen: Austin Author Lawrence Wright on 'Going Clear,' His Controversial Book on Scientology|last=Strayton|first=Jennifer|publisher=KUT News|date=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the FBI opened an investigation into potential human trafficking offences by the Church of Scientology, after the accounts of defectors from Gold Base were published. The ''Tampa Bay Times'' reported that FBI aerial surveillance of the property showed columns of executives being escorted to and from the Hole. However, no action was taken against the Church. The investigation ground to a halt after a ruling by a U.S. District Court judge in a case concerning Marc and Claire Headley's complaints against the Church over their treatment at Gold Base.&lt;ref name="FBI2" /&gt;

=== ''Headley et al. v. Church of Scientology International et al.'' ===
In 2009, Marc and Claire Headley sued the Church under the federal [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000]].&lt;ref name="PE-20120724" /&gt; In response, Church lawyers argued that the First Amendment prohibited the courts from considering "a forced labor claim premised upon&amp;nbsp;... social and psychological factors", because they concern "the beliefs, the religious upbringing, the religious training, the religious practices, the religious lifestyle restraints of a religious order."&lt;ref name="FBI2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology/fbi-scientology-investigation-gets-a-fresh-witness-but-hits-a-legal/1270193|title=FBI Scientology investigation gets a fresh witness, but hits a legal roadblock|last1=Childs|first1=Joe|last2=Tobin|first2=Thomas C.|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church acknowledged that the rules under which the Headleys lived included a ban on having children, censored mail, monitored phone calls, needing permission to have Internet access and being disciplined through manual labor. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals noted in a ruling given in July 2012 that Marc Headley had been made to clean human excrement by hand from an aeration pond on the compound with no protective equipment, while Claire Headley was banned from the dining hall for up to eight months in 2002. She lost {{convert|30|lb|kg}} as a result of subsisting on protein bars and water. In addition, she was coerced into having two abortions to comply with the Sea Org's no-children policy. The Headleys also experienced physical violence from Scientology executives and saw others being treated violently.&lt;ref name="PE-20120724"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pe.com/local-news/breaking-news-headlines/20120724-church-of-scientology-two-former-ministers-lawsuit-loses-on-appeal.ece|title=CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY: Two former ministers' lawsuit loses on appeal|last=De Atley|first=Richard K.|work=Riverside Press-Enterprise|date=July 24, 2012|accessdate=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the court found that the Church enjoyed the protection of the free exercise of religion clause in the [[First Amendment]], and that it could use the "ministerial exemptions" in employment law to deflect litigation over its treatment of its members. The judge ruled that the First Amendment disallowed the courts from "examining church operations rooted in religious scripture". Bringing the Church to account for how it disciplined its members was "precisely the type of entanglement that the religion clauses prohibit." However, the 9th Circuit did suggest that other types of claims would withstand appellate review, such as assault, battery or "any of a number of other theories that might have better fit the evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/25/marc-claire-headley-lawsuit_n_1700633.html|title=Marc And Claire Headley Lose Forced Labor Lawsuit Against Church Of Scientology|agency=Associated Press|date=July 24, 2012|accessdate=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling has effectively meant that it is impossible to bring charges against the Church based on claims of 'trafficking in persons.' As one attorney has put it, "Here is a court saying, albeit in a civil situation&amp;nbsp;... that there is nothing improper with this type of conduct and no ill motive can be imbued to the church."&lt;ref name="FBI2" /&gt; Former US federal prosecutor Michael Seigel says that the ruling "doesn't seem to leave much room for hope of success on a criminal prosecution". The FBI investigation was dropped in 2011.&lt;ref name="FBI2" /&gt;

=== ''Church of Scientology International v. Debbie Cook'' ===
In January, 2012, the Church of Scientology brought a lawsuit against Debbie Cook for defamation after she sent an e-mail to 3,000 Church members criticizing its fund-raising methods.&lt;ref&gt;Ortega, Tony (February 9, 2012).

The '''Transparency of Lobbying, Non-party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 2014''' is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom]] introduced in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2013-14/transparencyoflobbyingnonpartycampaigningandtradeunionadministration.html Proposed Bill - Transparency of Lobbying, Non-party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Bill] Parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bill was sponsored by the [[Cabinet Office]] and the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] (BIS). It was often referred to as "The Lobbying Bill" for short.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lobbying-bill-threatens-freedom-of-speech-warns-electoral-body-8796727.html Lobbying Bill threatens freedom of speech, warns electoral body] The Independent&lt;/ref&gt; It passed all Parliamentary stages, and received Royal Assent on 30 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Transparency of Lobbying, Non-party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 201|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2013-14/transparencyoflobbyingnonpartycampaigningandtradeunionadministration.html|year=2014|publisher=parliament.uk|author=UK Parliament|ref=harv|accessdate=15 Apr 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bill was founded on the principle of 'transparency' and 'cleaning up politics'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0001.htm#13090336000002 Hansard - Second Reading] Parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lobbying-bill-to-be-redrafted-over-charity-concerns-8800926.html Lobbying Bill to be re-drafted over charity concerns] The Independent&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23939635 Lobbying bill sinister and partisan, says Labour] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23967903 'Flawed' lobbying bill should be withdrawn, says committee of MPs] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The Bill was introduced partly in response to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] selection process in [[Falkirk (UK Parliament constituency)|Falkirk]] and the alleged shortcomings of the influence of [[Unite the Union]] in that process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-23193741 Labour's Falkirk row becomes national issue for Labour] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecentreleft.blogspot.com/2013/06/labour-and-unite-little-time-bomb.html Labour and Unite: a little time-bomb] Centre-Left&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with lobbying in [[Westminster]] also prompted the Bill.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-is-accused-of-using-lobbying-scandal-to-curb-labours-trade-union-support-8642757.html David Cameron is accused of using lobbying scandal to curb Labour’s trade union support] Independent.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|recent expenses scandal]] Prime Minister David Cameron had suggested that lobbying was the "next big scandal" to consume Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/7189466/David-Cameron-warns-lobbying-is-next-political-scandal.html David Cameron warns lobbying is next political scandal] Telegraph&lt;/ref&gt;

Some British [[trade unions]] suggested that the proposed Bill was a cynical move by the Coalition Government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22760075 Lobbying: Union anger over 'cynical' coalition move] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; A Government spokesperson described the proposed Bill as a "radical" Bill.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.politicshome.com/uk/story/35172/privacy_policy.html Govt to bring forward lobbying bill] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021085717/https://www.politicshome.com/uk/story/35172/privacy_policy.html |date=2013-10-21 }} PoliticsHome&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bill would reduce the expenditure by charities during an election period before they must be registered with the Electoral Commission to £5,000, a proposal which has been criticised by some charities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://disabilityrightsuk.org/news/2013/december/lobbying-bill-survey Lobbying Bill - Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234007/http://disabilityrightsuk.org/news/2013/december/lobbying-bill-survey |date=2013-12-30 }} Disability Rights UK&lt;/ref&gt;

In months directly prior to July 2013 incidents such as [[Patrick Mercer]]'s alleged lobbying for contracts related to Fiji brought the issues surrounding lobbying into sharp focus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2333850/Tory-Patrick-Mercer-quits-Is-moment-MP-signs-fake-lobbying-contract.html Is this the moment MP signs fake lobbying contract? Tory Patrick Mercer quits party as Cameron critic falls for sting operation and pockets £4,000 to lobby for Fiji] Daily Mail&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of the Bill==

===Part 1: "Registration of Consultant Lobbyists"===

This Part makes an offence of consultant lobbying without prior registration, with some exceptions for specific circumstances, and in addition creates a "Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists".&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2013-2014/0050/en/14050en.pdf Explanatory Notes] Parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Section 1 states that "A person must not carry on the business of consultant lobbying unless the person is entered in the register of consultant lobbyists."

===Part 2: "Non-Party campaigning etc."===

This Part amends [[electoral law]] relating to funding of candidates and electoral campaigning. The [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]] would be amended to reduce the amount of money permitted to be donated by "third parties", organisations which would "reasonably be regarded as intended to promote or procure the electoral success of a party or candidate". Section 26, Clause 5 amends PPERA to the effect that, when determining the intention of expenditure, "...it is immaterial that it can reasonably be regarded as intended to achieve any other purpose as well.”

Clause 11 adds a new Section into PPERA to include 'electoral material' that could be reasonably regarded as promoting a specific candidate or party.

===Part 3: "Trade Unions’ Registers of Members "===

This Part affects the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]] with regards to records of Trade Union membership lists and related administrative changes.

==Criticism==
The Bill, often referred to by the shorthand "Lobbying Bill", attracted criticism. The [[Electoral Commission]] admitted concerns over the "significant regulatory uncertainty" for businesses and charities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2013/09/03/the-electoral-commission-says-the-governments-lobbying-bill-is-bad-law-thats-unenforceable-and-a-massive-burden-on-free-speech/ The Electoral Commission says the government’s lobbying bill is bad law that’s unenforceable and a massive burden on free speech] Tax Research.org&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour MP [[Angela Eagle]] claimed during the "Third Reading" stage of the Bill that the legislation "seeks to silence critics of the Government in the run-up to the general election, while letting vested interests operate out of sight" and was "an object lesson in how not to legislate".&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100979000736 Hansard Third Reading] Parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The charities [[Oxfam]] and the [[Royal British Legion]] said that the Bill had a "lack of clarity".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23808996 Lobbying bill could silence us, say charities] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the Second Reading of the Bill in the House of Commons, on 3 September 2013, much criticism was made of the Bill. Some Members of Parliament referred to it as a "gagging Bill",&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0001.htm#13090336000639 Hansard Commons] Parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt; and others called it "risible and misconceived",&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0002.htm#13090336000729 Hansard Commons] Parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt; and said that it amounted to a "full-frontal attack on members of society".&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0002.htm#13090350000513 Hansard Commons] Parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt; 

The National Council of Voluntary Organisations strongly opposed the bill;&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.ncvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Chloe-Smith-non-party-campaigning-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of charities and other campaigning groups joined in opposition to the Bill, including Action for Blind People, Action for Children, the British Heart Foundation, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the Countryside Alliance, Guide Dogs, Islamic Relief UK, Hope not Hate, the National Federation of Women’s Institutes, the Royal British Legion, the RSPB and the Salvation Army.

==Support==

The [[Leader of the House of Commons]] [[Andrew Lansley]] defended the Bill as being necessary because of the lack of trust in politics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0001.htm#13090336000002 Hansard Commons] Parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal Democrat MP [[John Thurso]] called the Bill "a step forward".&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0002.htm#13090350000480 Hansard Commons] Parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The Deputy Leader of the House pointed out in the Commons that some of the claims made against the Bill, such as stopping updated health and safety legislation or stopping the creation of the Labour Party, were "completely outwith" the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960002249 Hansard Third Reading] Parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deputy Leader further explained that the Bill was intended to avoid the setting up in the UK of the so-called "Super PACs" used in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libdemvoice.org/tom-brake-on-38-degrees-and-the-transparency-and-lobbying-bill-35874.html Tom Brake on 38 Degrees and the Transparency and Lobbying Bill] Liberal Democrat Voice&lt;/ref&gt; The former Cabinet Officer Minister Chloe Smith underlined how the Bill was about "extending transparency" during elections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/232248/Transparency_of_Lobbying_Bill_letter.pdf Response to 38 Degrees] Gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliamentary timetable==

The Transparency of Lobbying, Non-party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Bill had its Second Reading on 3 September 2013. It completed its Commons stages on 9 October 2013. It was debated in the House of Lords from 22 October and completed its Committee stage on 18 December 2013. It passed its final parliamentary stage, third reading in the House of Lords, on 28 January 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lobbying bill to become law after Lords rebellion falters|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25934660|accessdate=1 February 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received Royal Assent on 30 January 2014.{{sfn|UK Parliament|2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Even the "mother of all parliaments ", the House of Commons, proceeded to act in the matter with the law on the lobbies:{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = La legge sulle lobbies|journal= Mondoperaio edizione online |date=2014| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89413984}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vin Mariani''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Mariani [[wine]]'') was a tonic and patent medicine created about 1863 by [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]], a French chemist from the island of [[Corsica]] who became intrigued with [[coca]] and its economic potential after reading [[Paolo Mantegazza]]’s paper on coca's effects. In 1863&lt;ref name="euvs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euvs.org/en/discover/man-behind-the-bottle/mariani|title = Angelo Mariani – Man Behind The Bottle – Discover |publisher = [[Exposition Universelle des Vins et Spiritueux]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There are some conflicting information on the actual dates, see Karch, Steven B. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EL30bVA3orkC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=Chantrels+Pharmacy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t_Oi6rEZN2&amp;sig=ixMOtbAscoKBqqHL216T2I1UxIQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4szzSvyGO4ve4QaQl7jaAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Chantrels%20Pharmacy&amp;f=false "A Brief History of Cocaine"]. [[Taylor &amp; Francis Group]]. Boca Raton, FL. 2006. Page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Mariani started marketing a [[coca wine]] called Vin Tonique Mariani (à la Coca du Pérou)&lt;ref name="euvs" /&gt; which was made from [[Bordeaux wine]] and coca leaves.&lt;ref name="inciardi"&gt;{{cite book

The [[ethanol]] in the wine acted as a solvent and extracted the [[cocaine]] from the coca leaves, altering the drink's effect. It originally contained 6 [[milligram|mg]] of cocaine per [[fluid ounce]] of wine (211.2&amp;nbsp;mg/L), but Vin Mariani that was to be exported contained 7.2&amp;nbsp;mg per ounce (253.4&amp;nbsp;mg/L), in order to compete with the higher cocaine content of similar drinks in the United States. Advertisements for Vin Mariani claimed that it would restore health, strength, energy and vitality.

== Promotion and testimonials ==
Mariani marketed the Vin Mariani for a number of ailments, touting its ability to increase energy, appetite and mood.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=a1TsUmxE7TkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=%22leo+xiii%22+flask&amp;ots=p6O4jfiHLs&amp;sig=7NE_r-CAp3zsAM3KbcQK2ouppQo#v=onepage&amp;q=pius&amp;f=false|title=Cocaine: Scientific and Social Dimensions|last=Bock|first=Gregory R.|last2=Whelan|first2=Julie|date=2008-04-30|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9780470514252|location=|pages=7–8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was promoted as a performance enhancer for creatives and athletes alike, and was endorsed by many notable people of its time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mariani solicited testimonials from a broad range of [[Europe]]an celebrities, including members of various royal families, politicians, artists, writers and other household names, and reprinted them in newspapers and magazines as advertisements.

[[Pope Leo XIII]] and later [[Pope Pius X|Pope Saint Pius X]] were both Vin Mariani drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=6c5rAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22pius+x%22+%22vin+mariani%22&amp;dq=%22pius+x%22+%22vin+mariani%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnncu445PbAhVJqlQKHa8CAKEQ6AEIYzAJ|title=Coca exotica: the illustrated story of cocaine|last=Kennedy|first=Joseph|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|year=1985|isbn=9780845347782|location=|pages=86|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Leo appeared on a poster endorsing the wine and awarded a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] gold medal to Mariani for creating it.&lt;ref name="inciardi" /&gt; [[Thomas Edison]] claimed it helped him stay awake longer.&lt;ref name="inciardi" /&gt; [[Ulysses S. Grant]] drank Vin Mariani while writing his memoirs towards the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/books/howard-markel-on-cocaine-in-anatomy-of-addiction.html?WT.mc_id=AR-D-I-NYT-MOD-MOD-M211a-ROS-0711-L1&amp;WT.mc_ev=click | title=The Lure of Cocaine, Once Hailed as Cure-All|author=[[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jules Méline]], the French prime minister, drank the wine despite being otherwise anti-alcohol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other notables who endorsed Vin Mariani include [[Émile Zola]], [[Victorien Sardou]], [[Henri Rochefort]] and [[Charles Gounod]], all of whom wrote testimonials that appeared as Vin Mariani advertisements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Inspiration for Coca-Cola ==
This tonic evidently inspired [[John S. Pemberton]]'s 1885 [[coca wine]] drink, [[Pemberton's French Wine Coca]]. Pemberton's recipe was very similar to that of Vin Mariani, including the coca leaves. It was differentiated only by the inclusion of the [[Africa]]n [[kola nut]], the beverage's source of [[caffeine]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=The Coke machine : the dirty truth behind the world's favorite soft drink|last=Blanding|first=Michael|date=2010|publisher=Avery|year=|isbn=9781583334065|location=New York|pages=14|oclc=535490831}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, when [[Atlanta]] and [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], Georgia, passed [[prohibition]] legislation, Pemberton responded by developing a carbonated, [[non-alcoholic]] version of his French Wine Coca. He called the reformulated beverage [[Coca-Cola]], for its [[stimulant]] ingredients coca leaves and kola nuts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Modern developments ==
Angelo Mariani failed to pass his [[cocawine]] production secrets down to subsequent Mariani family generations. However, Christophe Mariani, a possible descendant of Angelo Mariani, relaunched the product in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spisani |date=2016 |title=La renaissance du vin Mariani une affaire qui coule de source |url=https://www.corsematin.com/article/ajaccio/la-renaissance-du-vin-mariani-une-affaire-qui-coule-de-source |access-date=July 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christophe Mariani subsequently met the Bolivian president, Evo Morales, in Rome to discuss the commercialisation of Mariani cocawine in Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vinmariani.fr/articles-popularites.php |title=Vin Tonique Mariani Site Officiel |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Padovani |first=Ghjilormu |date=2016 |title=Le vin corse Mariani en passe de conquérir... la Bolivie |url=https://www.corsematin.com/article/article/le-vin-mariani-en-passe-de-conquerir-la-bolivie |access-date=July 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
