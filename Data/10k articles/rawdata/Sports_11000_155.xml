The '''1947 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race''', was the 3rd annual running of the "blue water classic" [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]].

The 1947 edition was once again hosted by the [[Cruising Yacht Club of Australia]] based in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]].  As with the previous two Sydney to Hobart Yacht Races, the 1947 edition began on [[Sydney Harbour]], at noon on [[Boxing Day]] (26 December 1947), before heading south for 630 nautical miles (1,170&amp;nbsp;km) through the [[Tasman Sea]], past [[Bass Strait]], into [[Storm Bay]] and up the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]], to cross the finish line in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]].

The 1947 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race involved a fleet of 28 competitors. The first edition, the [[1945 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]] had initially been intended to be conducted as a pleasure cruise, but by the 1947 edition, the competitiveness of the event had been well and truly set.

''Morna'', skippered by Claude Plowman won line honours in a time of 5 days, 3 hours and 3 minutes - exactly 10 minutes slower than its victory the previous year, but giving the vessel and skipper back-to-back wins. ''Westward'', skippered by GD Gibson was awarded handicap honours.

'''AHC Potaissa Turda''' is a [[team handball|men's handball]] club from [[Turda]], [[Romania]], that plays in the [[Liga Națională (men's handball)|Romanian Handball League]]. Potaissa Turda is one of the most important Romanian teams in the last decade. In the last four years, is the only team that have qualified for the Final 4, in every season. Potaissa Turda won the EHF Challenge Cup in 2018, after a final against AEK Athens.

Turda was promoted to the first division in 2011, not long time after the club was near bankruptcy, in 2008. In those days, their players played just for joy and weekly training was just a dream they could talk about.

Potaissa Turda's fairytail story began back in 2007, when their home sports hall, from ''Gheorghe Baritiu'' school, was inaugurated and the team's amateur players could play finally in Turda. For example, one of the sqaud's member was the actual team president, ''Flaviu Constantin Sâsâeac'', who used to play for Turda, and also being the team president, since 2003.

Also an old member of the club is the coach, ''Horațiu Gal [http://www.ahcpotaissa.ro/Acasa/interviu-horatiu-gal-ma-simt-foarte-bine-aici-turda-este-casa-mea.html]'', being the head coach for almost ten years, after retiring from his player career, playing last time in Germany, for '''TSV Bad Salgau'''.

Another reason why Potaissa's early succes is not that surprising, can be that the club has more youth squads, around '''220 childrend and young players''' representing Turda in national competitions.[https://pressone.ro/uriasii-din-curtea-scolii/]

The '''American Hearing Impaired Hockey Association''' (AHIHA) was established in 1973 by [[Chicago Blackhawks]] [[Stan Mikita]], and a local business man by the name of Irv Tiahnybik, after Irv discovered the difficulties his [[deaf|hard-of-hearing]] son was having with his hearing teammates.  The [[Ice hockey|hockey]] camp grew quickly, and drew deaf and hard-of-hearing ice hockey players from all over the country.

The organization hosts the annual, week-long Stan Mikita Hockey Camp in [[Woodridge, Illinois]] at the Seven Bridges Ice Arena.  The camp itself is free, though players do have to supply their own equipment and pay for their hotel room.

In addition to sponsoring the camp, AHIHA also helps advocate for its players, provides scholarships, and helps children obtain [[hearing aid]]s.  The [[Deaflympics]] [[ice hockey]] team is typically comprised almost solely of AHIHA players, and represented the USA once again in 2007 at Salt Lake City.

== Business operations ==
=== Services ===

Rental of the [[watercraft]] and associated equipment, such as oars, motors, [[paddle]]s, and life preservers, is the basic service provided. Some optional extras offered may include fishing tackle. Boat liveries may also be required or optionally provide watercraft classes or training.  The livery often will sell sunscreen, sunglasses, clothing, water bottles, live bait, maps and books as supplemental income.&lt;ref name=Genmar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/2004/08/23/story2.html|title=Genmar launches boat rentals - Minneapolis|work=Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal|publisher=American City Business Journals|accessdate=1 April 2014|author=Sam Black|date=August 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spetla&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles/spetla46.html|date=July 1997|title=

=== Equipment ===

In addition to the craft themselves, liveries may also maintain a [[marina]]. Numbers of craft in the fleet can vary from one to several hundred.  Fuel cost and storage is an important consideration for motorized crafts. Livery owners and employees must also clean, maintain, and store their fleet during inclement weather.&lt;ref name=spetla/&gt;

=== Location ===
Typically, the actual bodies of water used are not the property of the livery. In some cases, the launch or dock locations may be owned by the livery, "but could also be owned by a park or recreation authority and the livery operates there, with or without permits,&lt;ref name=spetla /&gt;  a term known as "granting a concession".

=== Liability ===
In the United States, the insurance for boat livery owners can be expensive and difficult to obtain.  According to an article in ''The Business Journal'' ([[Tampa Bay]]), keeping track of state laws and regulations is extremely important and new laws can cause expensive challenges for a livery operator.&lt;ref name=Salgat&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salgat|first=Ken|title=New watercraft laws challenge businesses|journal=The Business Journal [Serving Greater Tampa Bay]|date=August 25, 2000|issue=4|location=General OneFile.

|accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in a small coastal town in [[South Australia]], it is a rites-of-passage story about the interracial friendship between [[Australian rules football]] teammates Gary "Blacky" Black, a white boy, and [[Nunga]] Dumby Red. The novel is written from Blacky's point of view and covers the period leading up to the local football grand final and the summer after.

A film adaptation, ''[[Australian Rules (film)|Australian Rules]]'' was released in 2002.

==Plot==
The novel is set  the  small town in [[South Australia]], where the whites, or "Goonyas" live in "The Port", while the Nungas, the Aboriginal community, live in "The Point".

We are told very early in the text that the separate towns where the whites and the Aboriginal peoples lived "didn't have too much to do with one another", and this establishes the conflict that challenges Blacky and his sense of justice and loyalty throughout the text.

Blacky tells us, in a colloquial manner, of the various personalities of the town. We also learn of his large family of three sisters and three brothers; heavy drinking, hard hitting father, 'He only sat down to eat with us when the pub was closed'; and gentle, patient but exhausted mother. Blacky has a friend from the Point, Dumby, and a friend from the town, Pickles. Dumby is the best player in the team but this is not recognised, as is obvious on grand final day.

As the novel opens, Blacky is worried about the imminent grand final and the responsibility he carries as the team’s new first ruck. His opponent will be the unstoppable "Thumper". To protect himself, Blacky has devised the ‘Thumper tackle’ which is the ultimate defence of the coward: it looks like he is trying to tackle his opponent but is really an elaborate dodge. For the majority of the game Blacky keeps himself out of harm's way but near the death he inadvertently steps into the path of the Thumper leaving him concussed yet causing sufficient impedance to the Thumper such that time expires before a scoring shot at goal could be registered resulting in a win to Blacky's Port side.

During the teams after-party however, the coach's son is given the honour of the Best On Ground award, which he believes should have been bestowed upon Dumby Red, the star player of the team. Soon after the news reports that Dumby and his two brothers have been shot dead while robbing a Public Bar, resulting in the breakdown of Blacky's emotional life.

Blacky spends much of that winter dodging responsibility in a similar manner. By the end of the following summer, however, he understands the importance of making a stand and is able to do so. His brothers and sisters join him in his stand and the novel ends with Blacky at peace with himself, happy in his relationship with his siblings, and confident that he will be able to deal with the problems that will come with the morning.

Just before the grand final Blacky meets Clarence, Dumby's younger sister. During the celebratory after party Clarence and Blacky have the starts of a racially forbidden romance, this is explored in the second book, ''Nukkin Ya''.

Racism confronts Blacky and he is more and more aware that he thinks very differently from many of the townspeople. The turning point comes when Dumby is killed soon after Presentation Night while taking part in an armed holdup. Blacky attends Dumby's funeral and by doing so makes a stand.

The book was eventually adapted into a movie called 'Australian Rules'

The '''Estonian Rugby Union''' ({{lang-et|Eesti Ragbi Liit}}) is the governing body of [[Rugby Union]] in [[Estonia]] and was formed in 2007 in response to [[FIRA – Association of European Rugby|FIRA-AER]] expulsion of the [[Estonian Rugby Federation]]. In June 2009 the Estonian Rugby Union formally received recognition as the governing body of Rugby Union in Estonia from the [[Estonian Olympic Committee]] with permission to represent [[Estonia]] at international level.

In 2008 the Estonian Rugby Union signed a contract with [[Advanced Micro Devices]] to the primary sponsor of Rugby in Estonia and in July 2009 [http://www.tallink.ee AS Tallink], the largest ferry company in Estonia, agreed to support the Union. 
Stash are the provider of playing kit for the Estonian Rugby Union.

==History==
A combined Estonia/[[Latvia national rugby union team|Latvia]] side took on a Swedish representative side in the late 1990s, but a proper national team only started playing in 2009, touring [[England]] and playing two matches, losing both.

They came up against [[Kent]] club Tonbridge Juddians in their first match, coming out at the wrong end of a 94-7 scoreline. The Juddians gave them a rather torrid time in the scrums, which was probably influenced by the fact that the Estonians only had their first-ever scrum machine session on the morning of the match.

The second fixture saw them square off against England Deaf at [[Folkestone]], this time managing to keep the score to a respectable 21-27.

On 28 September 2013 The Estonians won their first official fixture against Finland A in Turku, Finland. With a score of 24 to 17.

==Active rugby clubs==
The Estonian Rugby Union currently has 5 registered clubs:

* [[RFC Kalev]] (formerly [[RFC Tallinn Sharks]]) in [[Tallinn]]
* [[RFC Vikat]] in [[Märjamaa]]
* [[RFC Patriots]] in [[Narva]]
* [[RFC Survivors]] in [[Pärnu]]
* [[RFC Tartu]] in [[Tartu]]

{{Bowling techniques sidebar |expanded=all}}
The '''flipper''' is the name of a particular [[Bowling (cricket)|bowling]] delivery used in [[cricket]], generally by a [[leg spin]] [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]]. In essence it is a back spin ball. Squeezed out of the front of the hand with the thumb and first and second fingers, it keeps deceptively low after pitching and can accordingly be very difficult to play. The flipper is comparable to a [[riseball]] in fast-pitch softball. 
 
By putting [[backspin]] on the ball the [[Magnus effect]] results in air travelling over the top of the ball quickly and cleanly whilst air travelling under the ball is turbulent. The lift produced means that the ball drops slower and travels further than a normal delivery. The slower descent also results in the ball bouncing lower.

The flipper is bowled on the opposite side to a slider, much in the same way that the top-spinner is bowled. On release, the bowler 'pinches' or clicks the thumb and forefinger, causing the ball to come out underneath the hand. There must be sufficient tension in the wrist and fingers to impart a good helping of backspin or underspin. In doing so the flipper will float on towards the [[batsman]] and land on a fuller length than he anticipated, often leaving him caught on the back foot when he wrongly assumes it to be a pullable or a cuttable ball. The back spin or underspin will cause the ball to hurry on at great pace with very little bounce, though this may be harder to achieve on softer wickets. A series of normal leg spinners or [[topspinner]]s, with their dropping looping flight, will have the batsman used to the ball pitching on a shorter length. The batsman may wrongly assume that the flipper will drop and loop like a normal overspinning delivery, resulting in the ball pitching under the bat and going on to either hit the stumps or result in [[leg before wicket]].

Much of the effectiveness of the flipper is attributable to the "pop", that is, the extra pace and change in trajectory that is imparted to the ball when it is squeezed out of the bowler's hand.

Occasionally, the term 'flipper' has been used to describe other types of deliveries. The Australian leg spinner [[Bob Holland]] employed a back spinning ball that he simply pushed backwards with the heel of his palm. Sometimes this form of front-hand flipper is called a "zooter". It is easier to bowl but not as effective as the amount of backspin is much less.

==Bowlers of the flipper==
It was reputedly invented by the Australian leg-spinner [[Clarrie Grimmett]]. Grimmett became so enamoured with the delivery that at times he bowled it almost as frequently as his stock leg break. The great [[Don Bradman]] once remarked to Grimmett that he must have forgotten how to bowl a leg break, as he bowled so many flippers. Bradman was bowled shortly thereafter at a memorial match by Grimmett who produced a perfectly pitched stock ball that turned just enough to remove Bradman's off bail. "There y'are Don, I told you I could bowl a leg break" was Grimmett's alleged response.

The flipper was the signature delivery of [[Anil Kumble]] of India and the Australian leg-spinner [[Shane Warne]] in his earlier years, until injury and later shoulder surgery restricted his ability to bowl flippers accurately. Like the googly, it may become more difficult to bowl as a bowler ages due to the flexibility and suppleness it demands from the bowler's wrist.

It is difficult to disguise the flipper entirely when bowling, as the hand action is distinctly different from a leg break. When Clarrie Grimmett first began bowling the delivery, batsmen would listen for the telltale clicking sound of his fingers; to compensate, Grimmett would often click the fingers of his non-bowling hand when ''not'' bowling the flipper to confuse the batsman.

[[Shane Warne]] is arguably the leading exponent of the flipper in recent times. [[Anil Kumble]] of India used the flipper well to his advantage. [[Brad Hogg]] of Australia has also used the flipper with great success in [[One Day International|Limited Overs Cricket]]

The '''Four Seasons Arena''' is a multi-purpose indoor sports and exhibition [[arena]] located in the city of [[Great Falls, Montana]], in the [[United States]]. Constructed in 1979, it served primarily as an ice rink until 2005. The failure of the practice rink's refrigeration system in 2003 and the management's decision to close the main rink in 2006 led to the facility's reconfiguration as an indoor sports and exhibition space. As of May 2011 it is the largest exhibition, music, and sports venue in the city.

==Conception and construction==
[[File:Montana Expo Park 15.JPG|thumb|Four Seasons Arena]]
Prior to the construction of the Four Seasons Arena, the city of Great Falls had no large indoor sports arena.  The gymnasium at [[Great Falls High School]], built in 1930, sat about 1,200 on wooden benches&lt;ref&gt;"Bison Slip Past Skyview." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' January 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; in an area designed for use primarily as a [[basketball]] court. The [[Great Falls Civic Center]], built in 1939, contained an ice rink but no other sports facilities. The [[University of Great Falls|College of Great Falls]] built the [[McLaughlin Center]] in 1966, which contained an [[Olympic-size swimming pool]] and 1,800-seat gym designed for use as a basketball court.&lt;ref&gt;"Recreation and Travel." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' February 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The city's largest sports venue was the gymnasium at [[Charles M. Russell High School]]. The gym, constructed in 1963, sat 4,000 in a basketball court.&lt;ref&gt;"Teams Ask Voters for an Assist." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' October 29, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of a large indoor sports center inhibited the growth of professional sports in the city, as well as the city's ability to host major high school athletic tournaments. In 1975, the city of [[Billings, Montana|Billings]] constructed the [[Rimrock Auto Arena at MetraPark|Montana's Entertainment, Trade and Recreation Arena]] (or METRA), a 12,000 seat multi-purpose arena.  In 1977, an organization known as Leadership Great Falls (a program of the [[Great Falls Area Chamber of Commerce]]) undertook a process to provide city civic and business leaders with a vision for the city of Great Falls.  Out of this year-long process came the request for the city to construct a large, multi-purpose, indoor sports arena.&lt;ref&gt;"Xpo Won't Predict the Future—It Will Make It Happen." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' February 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Great Falls City Commissioner John St. Jermain championed the effort to build an arena, and fought for a ballot initiative in 1977 that would have used city tax dollars to build it. But voters rejected the proposal.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;Young, Jeannie. "Former Commissioner Dies at Age 80." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' July 31, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnsonDevelopment"&gt;Johnson, Peter. "High Plains Development Authority." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' April 15, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; St. Jermain then sought and won in 1978 a federal grant to pay for the majority of the cost of constructing the facility.&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt; St. Jermain lost reelection in November 1978.&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt;

The Four Seasons Arena was built in 1979 on the grounds of the Montana State Fairgrounds (now known as [[Montana ExpoPark]]).&lt;ref name="EckeGift"&gt;Ecke, Richard. "Couple's Gift Helps Keep Local Ice Rink Dream Alive." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' July 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was built primarily with the federal grant and few other funds, the arena was half the size initially proposed.&lt;ref name="JohnsonDevelopment" /&gt;  Indeed, Four Seasons Arena was built primarily as an [[ice rink]].&lt;ref name="EckeGift" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another major sports venue was constructed in Great Falls at the same time.  This was Bison Fieldhouse, now known as R.W. "Bill" Swarthout Fieldhouse, on the campus of Great Falls High School.  The fieldhouse included a 3,500-seat basketball court/indoor track and an Olympic-sized swimming pool. See: "Prep Notebook." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' April 15, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; It also lacked [[HVAC|air conditioning]].&lt;ref name="PuckettPouring"&gt;Puckett, Karl. "County Pouring $3.2 Million Into Public Buildings." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' August 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The arena originally housed two ice rinks:&lt;ref&gt;Blanchette, John. "Pro Hoops In Montana Is Everything It Auto Be." ''Spokane Spokesman-Review.''

In 1994, Great Falls city voters approved a $7.9 million [[Bond (finance)|bond]] [[initiative]] to build a new exhibition hall on the fairgrounds, renovate the fair's historic buildings and Four Seasons Arena, and generally improve landscaping, lighting, and walkways at the fair.&lt;ref name="OyanAssess" /&gt; The {{convert|15000|sqft|m2}} Exhibition Hall (capable of seating up to 1,500 people) was constructed in 1995.&lt;ref name="ExhibitionSizes"&gt;[http://www.goexpopark.com/facility-info/exhibitionhall.php "Building Details."

==Operating history==
[[Cascade County, Montana|Cascade County]] owned the Montana State Fairgrounds, and built the Four Seasons Arena. Although not designed to be a multi-purpose arena, Four Seasons began to be put to a wide variety of uses.&lt;ref name="OyanAssess"&gt;Oyan, Katie. "SMG Seeks More Time to Assess ExpoPark." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' September 15, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The facility quickly began to show excessive wear due to these pressures.&lt;ref name="OyanAssess" /&gt; The facility's management also began to suffer. By 1987, the Fairgrounds were more than $600,000 in debt and the county's management of the Fairgrounds and Four Seasons Arena was heavily criticized.  In 1988, Cascade County signed an agreement under which the city of Great Falls took over management of the fairgrounds and Four Seasons Arena.&lt;ref name="CityRuns"&gt;"City Says It Should Run Fairgrounds." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' March 19, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; But the facility was already deteriorating. In 1988, the [[Montana High School Association]] (which schedules high school athletic tournaments) refused to allow the city to host any basketball tournaments at the Four Seasons Arena after 1989 because it was in such poor shape.&lt;ref name="USAMontana"&gt;"Montana." ''USA Today.'' April 21, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1989, the Montana Class B boys' high school basketball tournament was scheduled for the Four Seasons. But a major leak in the roof, which occurred just two weeks before the tournament, forced the event to be held at nearby C.M. Russell High School instead.&lt;ref name="USAMontana" /&gt;

In early 2001, the [[HVAC|heating and ventilation]] at Four Seasons Arena was upgraded for the first time since its construction at a cost of $124,100.&lt;ref&gt;Black, JoDee. "City Delays Move to Hike Utility Rates." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' February 21, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about the stability of the ice at Four Seasons, the city also commissioned a study of both rinks. The study concluded that both rinks needed $1.5 million in repairs and upgrades.&lt;ref name="SMGRidIce" /&gt; But this study was not acted on.  The city's management of the facility had also not gone smoothly. Nearly 20 groups which used the facility frequently (hockey teams, exhibitors, rodeo promoters, etc.), but relations between the groups were very poor and various groups accused city managers of playing politics in order to favor one group over another. In June 2001, city managers held an extraordinary day-long meeting of the arena's users in an attempt mediate these differences.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes, Katie N. "Special Mediator Leads Meeting With Arena Users." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' June 3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This meeting led to a major proposal to upgrade the arena. In August 2001, the various user groups proposed that the city spend $99,000 to purchase a new floor covering for the main ice rink that would reduce the lead-time for transformation of the main arena to just four hours.&lt;ref name="JohannesNewFloor" /&gt; But this proposal was not acted on. Instead, city managers said the most urgent needs at Four Seasons involved wooded dashers (waist-high walls) around the rink, a new cover for the ice (to keep it cold when not in use), portable bleachers to expand seating, upgrading and replacement of power lines and poles, a new scoreboard, and improvements to make the facility comply with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans With Disabilities Act]].&lt;ref name="CityRuns" /&gt;

The city's management agreement came to an end in 2003.  City managers argued that they should be allowed to renew the contract.&lt;ref name="CityRuns" /&gt; The city proposed using its own funds to renovate the arena, and to begin the process of planning for a new, greatly expanded multi-purpose convention center and sports arena.&lt;ref name="OyanAssess" /&gt; As a gesture of good faith, Great Falls city commissioners said they had spent $6,000 to study the ice rink covering issue and $2,000 on a handicapped-accessibility study,&lt;ref name="LeeAssess"&gt;Lee, Sonja. "Montana ExpoPark." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' November 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and had agreed to spend $200,000 to purchase the ice rink covering.&lt;ref&gt;"City Agrees to Fund Recreation Upgrades." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' September 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The purchased was designed to meet the needs of local youth [[hockey]] organizations, which in 2002 were the arena's largest tenant (paying $65,000 in fees in 2002 and an anticipated $85,000 in fees in 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Oyan, Katie. "Participants Split Over Fairgrounds Management." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' October 4, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was also designed to expand the facility's use, and reduce the city's subsidy to the fairgrounds.  Four Seasons managers noted that the arena had to turn away bands, comedians, and other entertainers because the venue could not be turned around fast enough.&lt;ref name="OyanSMGFee" /&gt; Cascade County managers, however, argued that although the county did not have the credit rating or tax revenues of the city, they could obtain grants to make the improvements the city was to pay for.&lt;ref name="OyanSMGFee" /&gt; They also said that their lack of management expertise did not matter, as they were considering contracting with [[SMG (property management)|SMG World]], an arena management firm, to run Four Seasons.&lt;ref name="OyanSMGFee" /&gt; In October 2002, SMG said it needed more time to assess the fairgrounds in order to make a firm offer.&lt;ref name="OyanSMGFee" /&gt; With Cascade County apparently committed to taking over the fairgrounds and Four Seasons Arena again, the city of Great Falls demanded that the county to pay $1 million to reimburse the city for improvements made there (a figure which included $142,250 renovating the heating, air conditioning, and carpeting at the arena).&lt;ref&gt;Oyan, Katie. "City's Bill: $1 Million From County." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' November 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The county refused, and offered to pay less than 20% of that figure.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sonja. "County Trims City ExpoPark Request." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' November 22, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; After extensive negotiations, Cascade County agreed to pay $384,370 over 10 years at 4% interest (a total which included all of the improvements to the arena).&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sonja. "City, County Sign ExpoPark Deal." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' December 7, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 12, 2002, Cascade County signed a formal agreement to allow SMG World to take over management of the fairgrounds and arena.&lt;ref&gt;Oyan, Katie. "Montana ExpoPark." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' November 13, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

SMG's management of the Four Seasons Arena and Montana State Fairgrounds lasted just five years. Although the city had already studied capital needs at the fair, Cascade County paid SMG another $57,750 to do so itself.&lt;ref name="LeeAssess" /&gt; SMG discovered severe problems with both ice rinks. In February 2003, it reported that the practice ice rink had leaked and the ice was at a {{convert|3|in|cm}} slant, which created a legal liability issue for the county.&lt;ref name="SMGRidIce"&gt;Lee, Sonja. "SMG: Get Rid of Ice." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' February 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; SMG proposed immediately closing the practice rink, and said that fixing the leaks would cost $600,000 to $750,000.&lt;ref name="SMGRidIce" /&gt; Another $150,000 needed to be spent to replace the dashers on the main rink to prevent them from collapsing and injuring players and/or fans.&lt;ref name="SMGRidIce" /&gt;

The ice rink problem highlighted a major issue confronting Four Seasons Arena. The cost of running an average four-day basketball tournament was about $16,000, and the arena lost about $3,000 per tournament.&lt;ref name="LeeDampen"&gt;Lee, Sonja. "Low Profits Fail to Dampen Arena's Desire for Basketball Tournaments." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' March 7, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; But basketball tournaments generated more than $1 million in additional spending to the city,&lt;ref name="LeeDampen" /&gt; far more than the revenues generated by ice hockey and more than enough to cover the losses on the tournament.&lt;ref name="LeeDampen" /&gt; Permanently losing some or all of the ice at Four Seasons would greatly expand the arena's ability to host money-making events.&lt;ref name="SMGRidIce" /&gt;

The ice rink issue was never adequately resolved. In March 2003, the county's insurance carrier said it would allow the arena to keep the practice rink open for another 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sonja. "Four Seasons Ice Likely to Stay Open." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' March 21, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, the county proposed keeping the main rink open only from mid-May to mid-June and from mid-August to mid-September, and closing the practice ice permanently.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sonja. "County Commission's Ice Proposal Draws Complaints." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' April 2, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The cooling system under the practice ice failed the first week of April 2003, and the county hired a refrigeration specialist from [[Canada]] to determine whether it could be repaired.&lt;ref&gt;"County Hires Specialist to Examine Arena Ice." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' April 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The consultant estimated the cost of repairs at $450,000,&lt;ref name="LeeRemodeling"&gt;Lee, Sonja. "Fairgrounds Remodeling Job." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' January 8, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; money the county did not have.  The practice ice closed permanently.  The loss of the practice ice and limited hours of use given for the main ice led the [[Great Falls Americans (Northern Pacific Hockey League)|Great Falls Americans]] junior league hockey team to move to [[Fargo, North Dakota]] in April 2003.&lt;ref name="Americans"&gt;"Great Falls Americans Leaving for Fargo, N.D." ''Associated Press.'' April 15, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; With the semi-closure of the main ice, Four Seasons Arena began seeking other events to make money.  In May 2003, it signed an agreement with the Class C Northern Division high school athletic league to "permanently" host District 7, 8, 9, and 10 boys' and girls' basketball tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;Giese, George. "Class C Division Ready to Sign Contract With Four Seasons." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' May 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2003, Four Seasons Arena spent $9,000 remodeling the old practice ice space (now known as "Side 2").&lt;ref name="LeeRemodeling" /&gt; The space was made handicapped-accessible, the floor was fixed, electrical improvements made, the dashers removed, a concessions stand built, and large-screen video monitors installed.&lt;ref name="LeeRemodeling" /&gt; The space was turned into a viewing area, and rented out to a local rodeo organization so that fans could watch live rodeo broadcasts (an event which quickly sold out).&lt;ref name="LeeRemodeling" /&gt; "Sparky," a [[mechanical bull]] used for riding and roping training, was also placed in Side 2.&lt;ref name="LeeRemodeling" /&gt; In January 2005, SMG announced it would provide ice in the main rink only in September and October.&lt;ref&gt;Geiese, George. "Ice Center Plans Heat Up." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' January 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was later expanded to include November, blocks of ice-time were so discontinuous that no hockey or [[figure skating]] events were scheduled for Four Seasons Arena that year.&lt;ref name="ThinIce"&gt;"Skating's Future on Thin Ice." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' February 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[All-American Professional Basketball League (2005)|All-American Professional Basketball League]] announced it was forming and intended to award Great Falls a franchise, SMG said it would stop offering ice events in the main arena permanently.&lt;ref name="ThinIce" /&gt; But the league collapsed just days after it began operations in September 2005, SMG said it would offer more ice time.&lt;ref name="Skornogoski"&gt;Skornogoski, Kim. "Ice Returning to Four Seasons." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' September 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; SMG managers estimated they would lose $30,000 in revenues by adding more ice time.&lt;ref name="Skornogoski" /&gt;

Cascade County renewed its contract with SMG in 2007.  The new two-year contract paid SMG $84,413 a year (about $4,000 less than the 2002 contract), and included a payment of 15% of operating revenues of all income over $2.5 million.&lt;ref name="PuckettExtend"&gt;Puckett, Karl. "Divided Commissioners Extend Contract With SMG." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' August 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; SMG also received 7.5% of all concessions sales (down from 10% in the old contract).&lt;ref name="PuckettExtend" /&gt; Cascade County also agreed to subsidize the fairgrounds and Four Seasons Arena by $750,000 a year, and pay the wages of all SMG employees operating the facilities.&lt;ref name="PuckettExtend" /&gt; But in 2009, Cascade County declined to renew SMG's contract, concluding it had learned enough to manage the fairgrounds and arena on its own.&lt;ref name="PuckettPart"&gt;Puckett, Karl. "County, SMG Part Ways." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' January 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Four Seasons installed air conditioning for the first time in its history.&lt;ref name="PuckettPouring" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ecke, Richard. "Energy Projects to Save County $1 Million by 2025." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' May 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the county loaned $400,000 to the arena to pay for the replacement of about a quarter of the permanent bleachers, upgrading and refurbishment of the remaining permanent bleachers, and replacement of the two sets of temporary bleachers.&lt;ref name="PuckettBleachers"&gt;Puckett, Karl. "County May Supply $400,000 for New ExpoPark Bleachers." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' June 19, 2010; "County OKs Plan to Replace ExpoPark Bleachers." ''Great Falls Tribune.''

"ExpoPark Gets Upgrades." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' July 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible renovations==
A major study by Cascade County and Montana ExpoPark in 2010 proposed making significant changes to the fairgrounds and Four Seasons Arena.  The study, conducted by Markin Consulting, disclosed that the race track grandstand's concrete foundation was crumbling, the livestock pavilion's sheet metal walls were rusting, the horse barns were poorly ventilated and lit, and Four Seasons Arena suffered from poor acoustics and limited seating.&lt;ref name="PuckettResearch"&gt;Puckett, Karl. "Research Highlights ExpoPark's Untapped Potential." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' February 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The report outlined a number of options, including spending $7 million to $9 million to replace the grandstand, spending another $35 million to build a larger arena, and paying $12.6 million to demolish all existing horse barns and service facilities and build a 2,000-to-3,000 seat track just for horse racing.&lt;ref name="PuckettResearch" /&gt;

Less radical solutions also existed. Four Seasons Arena could be converted into an exhibition hall, and the current Exhibition Hall transformed into a banquet hall, at a cost of $2 million.&lt;ref name="PuckettResearch" /&gt; The report said an alternative to the demolition of all existing equestrian facilities would be to construct a new 300-stall horse barn.&lt;ref name="PuckettResearch" /&gt;

The study did not advocate construction of a large facility like Rimrock Auto Arena at MetraPark in Billings.&lt;ref name="PuckettResearch" /&gt;

The same month, however, a private group announced it intended to build a new $40 million 6,000-seat indoor sports arena south of the city.&lt;ref name="IndoorProposed"&gt;"Indoor Sports Facility Proposed for Great Falls." ''Associated Press.'' January 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase of the project would be a two-story, {{convert|86300|sqft|m2|adj=on}} training facility that would include two side-by-side indoor soccer fields (configurable as an indoor softball field) with retractable seating for 500, a hardwood indoor basketball/volleyball court with mezzanine seating for 240, a wrestling area with three full-size mats and seating for 240, an indoor {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=on}} sprint track, two locker rooms, a classroom, a concessions area, and an [[urgent care]] area.&lt;ref name="IndoorProposed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MountainView45"&gt;[http://mvscgf.com/images/whole%20prospectus.pdf ''Prospectus.''

Four Seasons has also held a number of Class C basketball tourneys. In Montana, Class C athletics have a complex structure due to the large number of schools and the extensive geographic distances involved. Class C play is organized into divisions, with each division having two or more districts: Eastern Division (districts 2 and 3), Southern Division (districts 4 and 6), Northern Division (districts 7, 8, 9, and 10), and Western Division (districts 11/12, 13, and 14). Each district (which contains six to 11 schools) holds a district tournament, sending two or four winners (depending on the number of schools in the district) to the divisional tournament.  Each division holds a divisional tournament, sending two teams to the state tourney. Great Falls is located geographically in the Class C Northern Division. Four Seasons Arena hosted the Class C state boys' basketball tournament in 1999.&lt;ref name="BurchardMost" /&gt; In 2005, it hosted the first-ever combined Northern Division Class C boys' basketball tournament in Montana history (in which all four Northern Division district tourneys were held simultaneously).&lt;ref&gt;"Combined Tourney to Feature 16 Teams Starting Wednesday."

==Facilities==
Four Seasons Arena is a concrete and steel structure.  The exterior is painted unfinished concrete.  The interior walls are unfinished concrete, to which sound-absorbent acoustical panels (made of fabric-covered wood) are attached.  The floor is finished, polished concrete. The interior ceiling consists of exposed painted steel beams.

The main hall at Four Seasons Arena is a rectangular space {{convert|141|by|222|ft|m}}, for a total area of {{convert|33000|sqft|m2}}.&lt;ref name="FourSeasonsSizes" /&gt; The Side 2 room is a rectangular space {{convert|80|by|222|ft|m}}, for a total area of {{convert|17000|sqft|m2}}.&lt;ref name="FourSeasonsSizes" /&gt; In both rooms, clearance is {{convert|28|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="FourSeasonsSizes" /&gt; The arena has nine dressing rooms with showers, several hospitality/service rooms, and an office (available for client use).&lt;ref name="FourSeasonsSizes" /&gt; The Exhibition Hall is a rectangular space {{convert|220|by|80|ft|m}}, for a total area of {{convert|15000|sqft|m2}}.&lt;ref name="ExhibitionSizes" /&gt; It is at a right-angle to the arena itself, and is connected to it by a hallway, dressing rooms, offices, and restroom facilities. With offices, restrooms, and other space, the Four Seasons Arena has a total of {{convert|53000|sqft|m2}}.&lt;ref name="FourSeasonsSizes" /&gt; The wall between the main room and Side 2 is often removed to achieve a larger space.

Four Seasons has permanent banks of bleachers in front of the east and west walls, and in a balcony above the north wall.&lt;ref name="PuckettBleachers" /&gt; The permanent configuration leaves about {{convert|25|ft|m}} of space between the west bleachers and the wall, and about {{convert|35|ft|m}} of space between the east bleachers and the wall.  Temporary bleachers can be set up behind the east and west permanent bleachers, in front of the north side balcony, and against the south wall to expand the seating.&lt;ref name="PuckettBleachers" /&gt; Additionally, chairs may be set theater-style on the floor of the arena during concerts to achieve [[seating capacity]].

==Foundation==
The Four Seasons Arena is supported by the Four Seasons Sports Foundation. The nonprofit, private [[Foundation (United States law)|foundation]] raises money to help pay for the cost of bidding on sporting events at the Four Seasons Arena.&lt;ref name="LeeDampen" /&gt; Roughly half the cost of the bid is paid for by the arena, with the other half paid for by the foundation.&lt;ref name="LeeDampen" /&gt; In September 2011, the foundation selected George Geise as chairman of its newly formed outreach committee.  For 33 years the sports writer for the local ''Great Falls Tribune'' newspaper, Geise said he was charged with working more closely with local businesses, the foundation, the Tourism Business Improvement District, and sports groups around the state to find ways to make bids by the Four Seasons Arena even more attractive to organizations seeking a sporting venue.&lt;ref&gt;Mansch, Scott. "Committee Formed to Help Sports Foundation." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' September 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium''' ({{lang-id|Stadion Utama Gelora Bung Karno}}; literally "Bung Karno Sports Arena Main Stadium") is a multi-purpose stadium located at the center of the [[Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex]] in [[Central Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. The stadium is named after [[Sukarno]], Indonesia's first [[List of Presidents of Indonesia|President]]. It is mostly used for [[association football|football]] matches.

When first opened prior to the [[1962 Asian Games]] (Asiad), the stadium had a seating capacity of 110,000. It has been reduced twice: first to 88,306 in 2006 for the [[2007 AFC Asian Cup]] and second to 77,193&lt;ref name="cap"/&gt; between 2016 and 2017 for the [[2018 Asian Games|2018 Asiad]] (Asiad) and [[2018 Asian Para Games|Asian Para Games]]. In the 2016–17 renovations, all spectator benches are replaced by single seats. The 88,306  capacity made it the [[List of association football stadiums by capacity|7th largest association football stadium in the world]]. Today it is the 28th largest association football stadium in the world and 8th largest association football stadium in Asia. Since its opening, it holds record as the largest stadium in Indonesia.

The [[2007 AFC Asian Cup Final]] took place in the stadium. During the 2018 Asiad, the stadium hosted the [[2018 Asian Games opening ceremony|opening]] and [[2018 Asian Games closing ceremony|closing]] ceremonies and also its [[Athletics at the 2018 Asian Games|entire athletics events]] in between, while it used as the [[2018 Asian Para Games opening and closing ceremonies#Opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] and [[Athletics at the 2018 Asian Para Games|athletics competition]] venue for the 2018 Asian Para Games.

==Naming history==
Although the stadium is popularly known as Gelora Bung Karno Stadium (''Stadion Gelora Bung Karno'') or ''GBK'' Stadium, its official name is Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium (''Stadion Utama Gelora Bung Karno''), as there are other stadiums in the [[Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex]], such as the [[Istora Gelora Bung Karno|Sports Palace]] and the [[Gelora Bung Karno Madya Stadium|secondary stadium]]. It was known as Senajan ([[Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System|EYD]]: Senayan) Main Stadium from its opening through the 1962 Asiad until the complex's name was changed to Gelora Bung Karno by a Presidential Decree issued on 24 September 1962, twenty days after the games ended. During the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] era, the complex was renamed "Gelora Senayan Complex" and the stadium was renamed "Gelora Senayan Main Stadium" in 1969 under the "[[de-Sukarnoization]]" policy by then-President [[Suharto]]. After the fall of the dictatorship, the complex name was reverted by President [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] on a Presidential Decree effective since 17 January 2001.

==History==
[[File:Gelora Bung Karno 1962.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The stadium under construction, April 1962.]]
[[File:Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in 180-degree view; October 2011.jpeg|thumb|220px|right|The massive roof ring structure popularly dubbed as ''Temu Gelang'' by [[Sukarno]]]]
Construction began on 8 February 1960 and finished on 21 July 1962,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/indonesia/jakarta/entertainment-in-jakarta/sport-in-jakarta/major-sports-venues-in-jakarta/bung-karno-stadium-in-jakarta.html Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta, Bung Karno Stadium, Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta, Indonesia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in time to host the [[1962 Asian Games|following month's Asian Games]]. Its construction was partially funded through a special loan from the [[Soviet Union]]. The stadium's original capacity of 110,000 people was reduced to 88,306 as a result of renovations for the [[2007 AFC Asian Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.free-football.tv/news/Indonesia-Bahrain.html Indonesia v Bahrain (Group D) in Jakarta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into 24 sectors and 12 entrances, and into upper and lower stands. The special feature of this stadium is the huge steel roof construction that forms a gigantic ring called ''temu gelang'' (joined ring), something that was very rare in 1962. Other than to shade the spectators in all sectors from the heat of tropical sun, the purpose of this giant ring construction is also to emphasize the grandeur of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-mvqG8YbuHQC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=Temu+Gelang+Gelora&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bWx2qd71mq&amp;sig=6HVUtaHqhHlzSyHHeLkB48IBcjY&amp;hl=id&amp;ei=62D-TIHCGoTlrAfd5ZyHCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Temu%20Gelang%20Gelora&amp;f=false M.F.

==Recent renovations==
[[File:GBK Main Stadium new seats.jpg|thumb|180px|The new seats]]
Indonesia hosted the [[2018 Asian Games]] and [[2018 Asian Para Games]] and the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium was chosen as both Games' main venue. Due to the age of this stadium, which already exceeded fifty years, the government renovated the stadium in order to meet the standards made by the [[Olympic Council of Asia]]. All of the colorful wooden long benches ([[bleacher]]s) that still remained when the renovation commenced were scrapped and replaced with single seats, ultimately made it an [[all-seater stadium]]. The old single seats which had been installed during earlier renovation were also replaced. The seats, colored red, white, and grey, created an illusion of waving [[Flag of Indonesia|Indonesian flag]]. 

Its lighting system was upgraded from 1200 [[lux]] to 3500 lux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rahmat |first=Arby |date=12 January 2018 |title= Lampu Stadion GBK Saingi San Siro Milan|url=https://www.cnnindonesia.com/olahraga/20180112075320-142-268307/lampu-stadion-gbk-saingi-san-siro-milan|work=CNN Indonesia |access-date=14 January 2018|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baskoro|first1=Rangga|title=SU GBK Jadi Stadion Paling Terang Di Asia|url=http://wartakota.tribunnews.com/2018/01/12/su-gbk-jadi-stadion-paling-terang-di-asia|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=Tribunnews.com|date=12 January 2018|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the stadium's roof, there are 1,293 [[solar panel]]s installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diah|first1=Femi|title=Wajah Terkini Stadion Utama GBK: Rasa Baru yang Makin Merah Putih|url=https://sport.detik.com/sport-lain/d-3663511/wajah-terkini-stadion-utama-gbk-rasa-baru-yang-makin-merah-putih|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=Detik.com|date=29 September 2017|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; After renovation, the stadium accommodates the needs of disabled users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Raya|first1=Mercy|title=Stadion Utama GBK Sudah Lebih Ramah Disabilitas|url=https://sport.detik.com/sepakbola/liga-indonesia/3811762/stadion-utama-gbk-sudah-lebih-ramah-disabilitas|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=Detik.com|date=12 January 2018|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena was used as the temporary home of the UNO men's and [[New Orleans Privateers#Intercollegiate sports|women's]] basketball teams from the 2005-2006 season until 2008 while Lakefront Arena was being repaired following [[Hurricane Katrina]].

The facility has hosted [[Louisiana High School Athletic Association|LHSAA]] state wrestling tournaments.

Fatalities from [[wingsuit flying]] have occurred almost from the inception of the sport. Below are listed the most notable ones, including when wingsuit practice was not the first cause of death.

==List of fatalities due to wingsuit flying==
&lt;!-- NOTE: Unsourced additions WILL BE removed --&gt;
;16 September 1963: Stunt parachutist Gerard Masselin jumped from a [[biplane]] showing his wingsuit to the camera and was killed after his parachute failed to open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/another-bird-man-gerard-masselin-dies| title=Another bird man Gerard Masselin dies |work=British Pathé|date=1963| accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;5 October 2003: [[Dwain Weston]], an Australian skydiver and holder of the 2002 BASE-jumping world title, died after hitting a railing on the [[Royal Gorge Bridge]] near [[Cañon City, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="Herald 2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/10/07/1065292560465.html?from=storyrhs| title=Base jumper was 'meticulous'| journal=The Sydney Morning Herald| date=7 October 2003| accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://xtremesport4u.com/extreme-air-sports/the-legends-last-jump-on-the-last-day-whatever-happens-happens/| title=The Legend's last jump on the last day – whatever happens happens| last=Jones| first=Lola| publisher=XtremeSport| date=16 November 2008| accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not a BASE accident as he jumped from an airplane; it was technically an illegal jump as he used BASE equipment containing only one parachute (i.e., no reserve parachute, {{disputed inline|text=which is required to legally jump from an aircraft|reason=FAR wording is such that it only prescribes rules *if* a dual-parachute system is used. This has been tested, including by Luke Aikins in a no-parachute jump.|date=June 2017}}).  The pilots were eventually reprimanded for allowing the jump.
;22 October 2004: [[Roland "Slim" Simpson]] was a well known Australian BASE jumper. On 6 October 2004, Roland Simpson leapt from the [[Jin Mao Tower]], the tallest skyscraper in China at the time, in a wingsuit. After a good jump and flight, his parachute opened with multiple line twists making it difficult to steer and he crashed onto an adjacent building. He went into a coma, and died several days later in Canberra Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/08/1097089572149.html |title=A leap too far: leading base jumper killed in Shanghai |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=9 October 2004 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;16 February 2006: Chad Zielinski exited a DHC-6 Twin Otter, and he died upon impact into the sea, after a wingsuit flight over Belize. An inspection of his gear showed no attempt to deploy either main or reserve parachute. His gear did not have an automatic activation device installed. 
;9 May 2007: American adventurer and TV personality Jimmy Hall, age 41, was on an expedition to [[Baffin Island]] in northern Canada. After several days of successful jumps, Hall attempted a wingsuit flight through a canyon. He failed to clear a ledge, and impacted the cliff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/hawaii-tv-adventurer-died-in-nunavut-base-jumping-accident-agent-1.654592 |title=Hawaii TV adventurer died in Nunavut base jumping accident |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=14 May 2007 |accessdate=9 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;26 March 2009: [[Shane McConkey]] was a professional skier and BASE jumper. McConkey was performing a complicated ski-BASE jump in Italy. He experienced problems when he attempted to release his skis, and as a result failed to deploy his parachute in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://adventure-journal.com/2009/03/skier-shane-mcconkey-killed-in-base-jumping-accident/ |title=Skier Shane McConkey Killed BASE-Jumping in Italy |publisher=adventure-journal.com |author=Steve Casimiro |date=26 March 2016 |accessdate=13 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;12 April 2010: Geoffrey Robson died during a wingsuit BASE jump from [[Stellenbosch]], South Africa. He was a [[PhD]] candidate at [[ETH Zürich]] working on the mathematical modelling of the [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] characteristics of wingsuits. He was described by a former professor as "very careful [, taking] the sport seriously".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Base-jumper-was-very-careful-20100413 |title=Base jumper was very careful| publisher=News24, South Africa |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.idsc.ethz.ch/the-institute/former-staff/Robson-Geoffrey.html |title=Geoffrey Robson| publisher=ETH Zürich |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;23 June 2012: Hervé le Gallou, who was, along with Dave McDonnell, one of the first persons to jump from the [[Burj Khalifa]], died wingsuiting on [[Grande Tête de l'Obiou]] in the French Alps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newser.com/story/171588/how-a-mythic-base-jumper-met-his-untimely-end.html |title=How a Mythic Base Jumper Met His Untimely End |publisher=[[Newser]] |date=27 July 2013 |accessdate=12 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Portland Park''' was a [[association football|football]] ground in [[Ashington]], England. It was the home ground of [[Ashington A.F.C.]] between 1909 and 2008. It also hosted [[Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom|greyhound racing]] from 1936 until 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes/Sellers|first=Julia/John|title=Ladbrokes Greyhound Fact File|year=1992|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-22-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ground was opened in 1909 and was initially known as the '''Station Road Ground''' until 1914, when it was renamed Portland Park after the site's landowner the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]].&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFC&gt;[http://www.ashingtonafc.com/info-30-portland-park.html Portland Park] Ashington AFC&lt;/ref&gt; Ashington had previously played at Station Road, but sought a new ground after [[The Co-operative Group|the Co-op]] decided to double their rent.&lt;ref name=AFC/&gt; Ashington were elected to the Third Division North of [[the Football League]] in 1921, by which time the ground had a 1,000-seat grandstand had been built on the northern touchline. After their election to the League the stand was renovated, and the three other sides of the ground had concrete terracing installed. The money for the works was raised by issuing 2,000 shares, which brought in £6,000,&lt;ref name=AFC/&gt; and the capacity was raised to 20,000.&lt;ref name=NE/&gt;

The first Football League match played at the ground was on 27 August 1921, with Ashington beating [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] 1–0. The attendance of 9,000 was the highest Football League attendance recorded at Portland Park.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p103, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashington were voted out of the Football League at the end of the [[1928–29 Football League|1928–29 season]], with the last Football League match at Portland Park being a 3–0 defeat to [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]]. The attendance of just 706 was Ashington's lowest during their time in the League.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

The ground's record attendance of 13,199 was set for an [[FA Cup]] second round match against [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] on 9 December 1950, with Ashington losing 2–1.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt; The ground was no longer used for greyhound racing after 1964, but was subsequently used for [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]] and [[stock car racing]], becoming the home track of the [[Ashington Arrows]] speedway team. However only two speedway meetings were ever staged in 1972 with [[Phil Crump]] winning the Northumberland Open before the team was forced to leave after sparks led to a stand burning down.&lt;ref name=NE/&gt;

==Greyhound racing==
Racing was held from 3 October 1936 through to 1964 when the track closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Furby|first=R|title=Independent Greyhound Racing|pages =88|year=1968|publisher=New Dominion House}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track re-opened on 16 August 1984, with a circumference of 380 yards. Featuring sharp bends, race distances were 270, 480, and 660 yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racing ended during March 1993.

==Closure==
In 2005 it was announced that the site had been sold for a retail development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/asda-way-play-1538595 There Asda be a way to play on] Evening Chronicle, 16 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Ashington remained at Portland Park until 2008, when they moved to Woodhorn Lane. The last-ever game at the ground was played on 15 February 2008, with Ashington losing 3–2 to [[Seaham Red Star F.C.|Seaham Red Star]] in front of 1,954 spectators.&lt;ref name=AFC/&gt; Ashington's final goal at the old ground was scored by centre forward Gareth Bainbridge. The site was used to build an [[Asda]] supermarket.&lt;ref name=NE&gt;[http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/2054490.print/ Ashington to ashes – the Asda price] Northern Echo, 19 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17789">'''Russian Machine Never Breaks''' ('''RMNB''') is a credentialed [[Washington, D.C.]] area hockey [[blog]] that covers [[professional ice hockey]]. Created in 2009, RMNB received local and national [[#Media attention|media attention]] when it was the first U.S. media outlet to cover the [[2013 Russian meteor event]] in the city of [[Chelyabinsk]], [[Russia]]. RMNB has been featured on Fox News DC and [[NPR]] ''[[Weekend Edition Sunday]]'', and in '' [[The Atlantic]]''.

==About==
RMNB is a fan-operated, credentialed, multinational hockey blog that covers the [[Washington Capitals]] of the [[National Hockey League]], the [[Hershey Bears]] (the Capitals' [[American Hockey League]] affiliate), and their respective players. Created in 2009 by [[#Ian Oland|Ian Oland]] and [[#Peter Hassett|Peter Hassett]], RMNB's mission is to "make hockey as fun to read about as it is to watch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassett|first=Peter|title=About RMNB|url=http://www.russianmachineneverbreaks.com/about-rmnb/|work=blog|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; RMNB takes its name from current Capitals captain and Russian native, [[Alexander Ovechkin]]. In response to questions from the media about a potential injury after being hit with a puck, Ovechkin was quoted in 2006 stating, "I'm okay; Russian machine never breaks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=El-Bashir|first=Tarik|title=Caps' 'Russian Machine' Fine After Puck Hits Foot|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/26/AR2006102601518.html|accessdate=16 February 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=27 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, RMNB received local and national media attention when co-founder and writer Peter Hassett, with contributing writers [[#Fedor Fedin|Fedor Fedin]] and Ian Oland, published the first U.S. media report about the [[#2013_Russian_meteor_event|Russian meteor event]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myfoxdc.com/video?autoStart=true&amp;topVideoCatNo=default&amp;clipId=8400568#.UR-4IcTrKrs.gmail|title=Hockey Website Helps Break Russia Meteor News|last=Thomas|first=Will|date=15 February 2013|accessdate=16 February 2013|newspaper=Fox News DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/02/17/172235263/how-a-hockey-blog-got-the-scoop-on-the-russias-meteor|title=How A Hockey Blog Got The Scoop On The Russia's Meteor|last=Martin|first=Rachel|date=17 February 2013|accessdate=17 February 2013|newspaper=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/02/how-a-dc-hockey-fan-site-got-the-russian-meteorite-story-before-the-ap/273225/|title=How a DC Hockey Fan Site Got the Russian Meteorite Story Before the AP|last=Franke-Ruta|first=Garance|date=15 February 2013|accessdate=16 February 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Coverage==

===2013 Russian meteor event===

On February 14, 2013, Peter Hassett was contacted by Moscow correspondent Fedor Fedin about reports of an explosion in [[Chelyabinsk]], Russia. The writers were following news about Chelyabinsk because it's the hometown of Capitals center [[Evgeny Kuznetsov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whyno|first=Stephen|title=Capitals still 'prepared to wait' for Evgeny Kuznetsov|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/capitals-watch/2012/jun/14/capitals-still-prepared-wait-evgeny-kuznetsov/|accessdate=16 February 2013|newspaper=Washington Times|date=14 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625113201/http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/capitals-watch/2012/jun/14/capitals-still-prepared-wait-evgeny-kuznetsov/|archivedate=25 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By gathering information from [[social media]] videos and [[Twitter]], including an account from former NHL goalie [[Michael Garnett]] and other eyewitnesses, Fedin and Hassett discovered that a meteor had hit Chelyabinsk, and Hassett (with additional reporting by Fedin and Ian Oland) published the news on their blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.russianmachineneverbreaks.com/2013/02/14/what-is-happening-in-chelyabinsk/|title=Explosions in Chelyabinsk; Meteor Suspected (UPDATED)|date=2013-02-15|website=Russian Machine Never Breaks|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the story, Hassett was interviewed by [[Garance Franke-Ruta]], a senior editor at ''[[The Atlantic]]''. He confirmed that he published the article a little after 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST. Franke-Ruta wrote that [[The Associated Press]] did not break the news until 12:21&amp;nbsp;a.m. EST Friday, confirming that Hassett and RMNB were the first to report the story in the United States. After Franke-Ruta's story was published, other news outlets began to pick up the story.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On Friday evening, Hassett was interviewed by Will Thomas of Fox News DC who also confirmed that RMNB was the first to report on the meteor. On Sunday morning February 17, 2013, Hassett and Gordon were interviewed by NPR's ''Weekend Edition Sunday'' host, [[Rachel Martin (broadcast journalist)|Rachel Martin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On this broadcast Martin confirmed that RMNB was the first to break the story in the United States by "about an hour and a half".

Though not affiliated with the Washington Capitals nor endorsed by them, the Capitals' owner, [[Ted Leonsis]], congratulated RMNB for its coverage of the meteor event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leonsis|first=Ted|title=Bravo RMNB|url=http://tedstake.monumentalnetwork.com/bravo-rmnb/index.jsp|publisher=Monumental Network|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michal Neuvirth translation controversy===
In August 2012, Russian Machine Never Breaks published a translation of an interview given by Washington Capitals goaltender [[Michal Neuvirth]] to František Suchan of iSportz.Cz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.russianmachineneverbreaks.com/2012/08/20/michal-neuvirth-i-advised-vokoun-to-go-to-the-penguins-holtby-is-my-weakest-competition-yet/|title=Michal Neuvirth: I Advised Vokoun to Go to the Penguins; Holtby is my Weakest Competition Yet|date=2012-08-21|website=Russian Machine Never Breaks|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interview contained controversial remarks about current teammate [[Braden Holtby]], Capitals' captain Alexander Ovechkin, former teammate [[Alexander Semin]], former coach [[Dale Hunter]], and other Capitals players. The interview was picked up by hockey media in the United States and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capitals-insider/post/michal-neuvirth-alex-ovechkin-isnt-what-he-used-to-be/2012/08/21/9aebc9d2-eb95-11e1-a80b-9f898562d010_blog.html|title=Michal Neuvirth: Alex Ovechkin ‘isn’t what he used to be’|last=Applebaum|first=Lindsay|date=21 August 2012|accessdate=16 February 2013|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nichols|first=Chris|title=Neuvirth: Ovechkin 'isn't what he used to be'|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2012/08/21/neuvirth_unleashed/|accessdate=16 February 2013|newspaper=SportsNet|date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following news outlets published all or parts of RMNB's translation: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capitals-insider/post/michal-neuvirth-alex-ovechkin-isnt-what-he-used-to-be/2012/08/21/9aebc9d2-eb95-11e1-a80b-9f898562d010_blog.html Washington Post], [http://aol.sportingnews.com/nhl/story/2012-08-21/michal-neuvirth-tweaks-braden-holtby-alex-ovechkin-washington-capitals Sporting News], [http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2012/08/21/michal-neuvirth-sounds-off-on-semin-ovechkin-and-dale-hunter/ NBC Sports ProHockey Talk], [http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2012/08/21/neuvirth_unleashed/ NHL SportsNet], and [https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/capitals-goalie-michal-neuvirth-thinks-braden-holtby-weakest-025232112--nhl.html Yahoo Sports].

In response to the coverage, Michal Neuvirth conducted an interview with Washington Capitals senior writer Mike Vogel where he commented that "there was some misunderstanding. They changed my meaning a lot. I was talking about the boys in a good way. They translate to the way they want it. I feel like they got nothing to write about right now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Checking in with Michal Neuvirth|url=http://video.capitals.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=185497|work=Video|publisher=Washington Capitals|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuvirth was also quoted by NHL News and [[Sportsnet]], saying the interview was mistranslated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=640409|title=Neuvirth: Comments on Capitals translated wrong|website=NHL.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/michal-neuvirth-washington-capitals-comments-mistranslated/|title=Neuvirth: Capitals criticisms mistranslated - Sportsnet.ca|work=Sportsnet.ca|access-date=2017-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 21, 2012, RMNB responded to criticisms of their translation by publishing a clarification about the interview. Hassett wrote, "While we stand by the articles we published, we acknowledge that translation is as much an art as it is an academic skill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassett|first=Peter|title=A Clarification on the Neuvirth Interview and a Note on Translations|url=http://www.russianmachineneverbreaks.com/2012/08/21/a-clarification-on-the-neuvirth-interview-and-a-note-on-translations/|publisher=Russian Machine Never Breaks|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that, "Neuvirth’s meaning may have been misconstrued." However, in a post on August 30, 2012, RMNB announced that its team had hired a professional translation firm, [[TransPerfect]], to objectively translate the Neuvirth interview. RMNB compared TransPerfect's translation and its own side by side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.russianmachineneverbreaks.com/2012/08/30/the-neuvirth-translation-verification-and-attribution/|title=The Neuvirth Translation: Verification and Attribution|date=2012-08-31|website=Russian Machine Never Breaks|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After review, RMNB stands by its translation as the writers felt the professional translation and their own were nearly identical in meaning and therefore accurate.

===Tim Thomas "Obama" Signs and Masks===
Leading into the Capitals 2011-12 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals matchup against the [[Boston Bruins]], Hassett published an article discussing [[Tim Thomas (ice hockey)|Tim Thomas]]'s performance after he snubbed the U.S. president [[Barack Obama]] during the Bruins' [[Stanley Cup]] celebration at the White House. Via a chart, Hassett showed that as Obama's approval rating got stronger, Thomas's save percentage got weaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://russianmachineneverbreaks.tumblr.com/post/21209802241/tim-thomass-save-percentage-vs-barack-obamas|title=Russian Machine Never Breaks, Tim Thomas’s save percentage vs. Barack Obama’s...|website=Russian Machine Never Breaks|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Oland also made Obama signs and masks to try and throw Thomas off his game. Many Capitals fans in game three printed the signs out and wore the masks, gaining the blog national attention. [[Hockey Night in Canada]] did a segment on the posts during their live coverage of the game, ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' wrote a story about it, and [[ESPN|ESPN's]] [[Pardon the Interruption]] discussed the signs and masks the next day on its show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.russianmachineneverbreaks.com/2012/04/16/photos-caps-fans-taunt-tim-thomas-with-obama-signs/|title=Photos: Caps Fans Taunt Tim Thomas With Obama Signs|date=2012-04-17|website=Russian Machine Never Breaks|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/17/tim-thomas-obama-signs-capitals-fans_n_1431367.html|title=Caps Fans Use Obama To Taunt Bruins Star|last=Klopman|first=Michael|date=17 April 2012|work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.russianmachineneverbreaks.com/2012/04/17/ptis-michael-wilbon-tony-kornheiser-discuss-obama-signs/|title=PTI’s Michael Wilbon &amp; Tony Kornheiser Discuss Obama Signs|date=2012-04-18|website=Russian Machine Never Breaks|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barack the Red White House Campaign===
The Barack the Red campaign is a petition by Capitals fans for former President [[Barack Obama]] to attend a Washington Capitals game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.russianmachineneverbreaks.com/barackthered/|title=Barack The Red {{!}} Help RMNB Get President Obama To A Washington Capitals Game|website=www.russianmachineneverbreaks.com|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was started by Ian Oland, co-founder of Russian Machine Never Breaks. The Barack the Red website features an open letter to President Obama and a petition with a link to the [[Facebook]] page where supporters are asked to "like" the page to show support for the campaign.

In 2011, [[Robert Gibbs]], a senior campaign advisor for Barack Obama, was asked if President Obama were planning to attend a Washington Capitals game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Gibbs Is Asked if President Obama Will Barack The Red|url=http://vimeo.com/10144016#at=0|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reporter, [[The Washington Post|''The Washington Post''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s]] Scott Wilson referenced the Barack the Red campaign started by Oland.

President Obama has not attended a Washington Capitals game.

===2015 Winter Classic Jerseys===
On September 22, 2014, Russian Machine Never Breaks revealed images from inside DC's [[Nationals Park]] that suggested the [[Washington Capitals]] would be introducing a new logo for the [[2015 NHL Winter Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.russianmachineneverbreaks.com/2014/09/22/is-this-the-capitals-logo-for-the-2015-winter-classic/ | title=Is This the Capitals' Logo for the 2015 Winter Classic? | publisher=Russian Machine Never Breaks | accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following day, RMNB was the first to post leaked images of the new Winter Classic jerseys prior to their official unveiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.russianmachineneverbreaks.com/2014/09/23/the-capitals-new-winter-classic-jersey/|title=The Capitals New Winter Classic Jersey|publisher=Russian Machine Never Breaks|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl/story/2014-09-23/washington-capitals-winter-classic-jersey-logo-design|title=Washington Capitals Winter Classic Jersey Logo Design|publisher=The Sporting News|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/dcsportsbog/status/514453184438616065|title=Dan Steinberg on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2017-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Savina Ski Jumping Center''' is a [[ski jumping]] complex located in [[Ljubno ob Savinji]], Slovenia.

==History==
The first ski jumping competition in Ljubno was held in 1931. In 1949, the construction of the new K-60 hill began. The hill was planned and constructed by [[Stanko Bloudek]], who also constructed the [[Letalnica bratov Gorišek]] ski flying hill. The construction was completed in 1952. The smaller training hills (K-18 nad K-20) were constructed in 1974 and 1955, respectively. The local ski jumping club ''SSK Ljubno'' was founded in 1973. In 1983, the K-20 hill was covered with plastic mate. In 2005, the venue was reconstructed according to the modern regulations set by the [[International Ski Federation]]. In 2015, the venue underwent major renovation.&lt;ref name="2015renovation"/&gt;

The venue hosted twelve [[Fédération Internationale de Ski|FIS]] [[Ski jumping World Cup]] events for ladies as of 2018. [[Daniela Iraschko-Stolz]] holds the hill record with 96.6 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rtvslo.si/sport/zimski-sporti/mmc-tv-smucarski-skoki-na-ljubnem/414846|title=Trojna nemška zmaga na Ljubnem, Ema Klinec znova peta|date=12 February 2017|accessdate=12 February 2017|language=sl|author=D.

''This article is about hunting platforms. For a stand of trees, see [[Grove (nature)]].''

'''Tree stands''' or '''deer stands''' are open or enclosed platforms used by [[hunter]]s. The platforms are secured to trees in order to elevate the hunter and give him or her a better vantage point.  A tripod stand is a similar device, but because it is freestanding rather than attached to a tree, it is not technically a tree stand.

==Types==
[[Hunters]] use many different types of tree stands.
[[File:Tree stand.jpg|thumb|Ladder-style tree stand]]

===Climbing stand===
Two parts make up climbing stands.  The bottom part is the standing platform and the top is the seat.  Not all the top parts have backs for the seats.  There is normally a strap that connects the two parts, so if the bottom falls while in the tree or climbing, the platform doesn’t fall all the way to the ground, stranding the hunter.  Only trees that have no limbs up to the height desired for hunting will work.

Climbing tree stands have a couple of different styles to connect to the tree.  The part that wraps around the tree can be made from a thick cable or [[boomerang]] shaped piece of [[metal]].  The part that wraps around the tree is fastened to the stand with a [[Screw|bolt]] or [[pin]] for easy adjustment for different tree sizes.

Before climbing the tree both parts need to be adjusted to the tree so that both upper and lower parts are angled up to account for the narrowing of the tree.  To climb the tree the back of each part is angled to the tree one at a time and pulled up.  Then the part that the hunter is moving is set back level and the next part is moved up.  This is done until the hunter is at the desired height.  In addition to the tree stand, some hunters use a safety harness to prevent injury in the event that any component of the tree stand fails. You should always be connected to the tree for safety. To descend the tree, the hunter simply reverses the order of operations to climb the tree - lowering the standing platform, standing on the standing platform, then lowering the sitting platform.

===Ladder stand===
Ladder stands are a stand with a seat and platform along with the ladder to climb up into the stand.  A ladder stand has a seat and platform that connect to the tree with the ladder coming off the front of the platform to give the hunter access to the stand.  Ladder stands are stationary because of the size and lack of ability to move through the woods quietly.  Stability is good because of the connection to the tree and support from the ground.  Hunters can use one and two person ladder stands.

===Hanging stand===
Hanging stands can resemble ladder stands without the ladder, and the hanging stand is also stationary. Hanging stands connect to the tree with chains or cables at the desired height. To get up to a hanging stand hunters use ladders or sections of ladders secured to the tree (called "climbing sticks"), or they use screw in steps that screw in the tree and allow the hunter to climb up to the stand.

===Box stand===
[[File:Elevated hunting blind.jpg|thumb|Elevated "Box" type [[hunting blind]]]]
Box stands are large enclosed stands that almost look like a shed, they can be built to various heights with ladders or steps to enter when elevated. These are designed to help get out of the weather and keep you hidden from view of game. Most are made from lumber with plywood walls and flooring with a wood or metal roof. They are designed mostly for use along the edge of fields, where you can see long distances.

==Uses==
The inherent functional flexibility of tree stands allows hunters to use them in different ways. [[Whitetail deer]] are the most popular animal to hunt out of a tree stand,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} but other animals can be hunted from tree stands.

Tree stands can give the hunter an advantage, as the hunter sits up in a tree. This allows the hunter to see over intervening brush and vegetation that might otherwise block the hunter's view of approaching game. The advantage is not always clear, however, as early fall hunting in hardwoods bottoms can result in shortened line of sight, mostly because of heavy foliage still on the trees. This can be remedied by cutting shooting lanes for bows and firearms to see better from the tree stand.

Hunters use climbing stands to take the stand to different locations easily. Although not permanent like ladder stands and hanging stands, they can relocate a hunter to a different tree easily. Some hunters do leave them in the woods at the base of the tree. Climbing stands allow hunters that want to hunt from them to use a climbing stand at a location that will not allow them to keep a stand up during the whole season. Often ladder stands and hanging stands do not move easily, so they tend to stay on one tree. Because branches limit climbing stand use, ladder stands and hanging stands allow hunters more options on the trees with many branches at a lower height.

A few accessories are available for tree stands. Rope from the stand to the ground allows the hunter to pull up accessories or their weapon once in the stand. Besides the safety, hanging, ladder, and rope equipment, hunters can get:

*	Bow holders
*	Shooting rests
*	Blinds for around the stand
*	Covers over the stand
*       Umbrellas to protect the hunter from rain
*       Seat pads
*       Camouflage tape to disguise the stand

==Safety==
[[Safety]] is the biggest consideration for tree stands. A body [[Climbing harness|harness]] is the most important part of tree stand safety.  Many different styles of harness can keep hunters safe. One harness compiled of a belt around the waist of the person and one around tree with a strap between the two can keep the hunter safe. Another harness is a full body harness, which has shoulder straps and straps around the legs. The full body harness attaches to the tree the same way the belt harness does. Attaching the harness as soon as the hunter is in the tree keeps the hunter safe while setting up for the hunt. The strap between the harness and strap around the tree should be long enough to allow the hunter to move a little and short enough so if the hunter falls they do not fall too far.

Tree stand users should always check over their stands to ensure good working condition. A tree stand in poor condition can be unsafe for the hunter to hunt from.  Checking the steps up to the stand for safely and stability can prevent falling while climbing up to the stand.

Never carry equipment while climbing. Use a haul line to raise or lower your equipment.

In [[baseball]], the '''umpire''' is the person charged with [[referee|officiating]] the game, including beginning and ending the game, enforcing the rules of the game and the grounds, making judgment calls on plays, and handling the disciplinary actions.&lt;ref name="Official rules"&gt;{{cite web |title=Official Rules: 9.00 The Umpire |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/umpire_9.jsp |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often shortened to the colloquial form '''ump'''. They are also sometimes addressed as '''blue''' at lower levels due to the common color of the uniform worn by umpires. In professional baseball, the term ''blue'' is seldom used by players or managers, who instead call the umpire by name. Although games were often officiated by a sole umpire in the formative years of the sport, since the turn of the 20th century, officiating has been commonly divided among several umpires, who form the '''umpiring crew'''.

==Duties and positions==
[[File:Umpire Malachi Moore San Antonio Texas 2016.jpg|thumb|Home plate umpire Malachi Moore reviews the [[Glossary of baseball (L)#lineup cards|lineup cards]] from both teams before a 2016 minor league baseball game]]
In a game officiated by two or more umpires, the '''umpire in chief''' (or '''home plate umpire''') is the umpire who is in charge of the entire game. This umpire calls [[strike zone|balls and strikes]], calls [[fair ball]]s, [[foul ball]]s short of first/third base, and makes most calls concerning the [[batting (baseball)|batter]] or concerning [[baserunner]]s near home plate. To avoid injury, the home plate umpire wears similar equipment to the catcher, including mask, chest protector, leg guards and shoes with extra protection added over the laces.&lt;ref name="Official rules" /&gt; If another umpire leaves the infield to cover a potential play in foul ground or in the outfield, then the plate umpire may move to cover a potential play near second or third base. (The umpire-in-chief should not be confused with the crew chief, who is often a different umpire; see below.) In the event that an umpire is injured and only three remain, the second base position will generally be left vacant.

In nearly all levels of organized baseball, including the majors, an umpiring crew rotates so that each umpire in the crew works each position, including plate umpire, an equal number of games. In the earliest days of baseball, however, many senior umpires always worked the plate, with Hall of Fame umpire [[Bill Klem]] being the last umpire to do so. Klem did so for the first 16 years of his career.&lt;ref name="Chief"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=591266 |title=Chief among game's umpires |date=2007-04-14 |publisher=Journal Sentinel |author=Haudricourt, Tom |accessdate=2007-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111537/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=591266 |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Major League level, an umpiring crew generally rotates positions clockwise each game. For example, the plate umpire in one game would umpire third base in the next.

Other umpires are called '''base umpires''' and are commonly stationed near the bases. (''Field umpire'' is a less-common term.) When two umpires are used, the second umpire is simply the '''base umpire'''. This umpire will make most calls concerning runners on the bases and nearby plays, as well as in the middle of the outfield. When three umpires are used, the second umpire is called the '''first-base umpire''' and the third umpire is called the '''third-base umpire''', even though they may move to different positions on the field as the play demands.&lt;ref name="Official rules" /&gt;  These two umpires also call [[checked swing]]s, if asked by the plate umpire (often requested by catcher or defensive manager; however, only the plate umpire can authorize an appeal to the base umpire): the first base umpire for right-handed batters, and the third base umpire for left-handed batters; to indicate a checked swing, the umpire will make a "safe" gesture with his arms. To indicate a full swing, he will clench his fist.

[[File:MLB umpire.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A second base umpire ([[Mike Reilly (umpire)|Mike Reilly]]) at an MLB game in 2008.]]

When four umpires are used (as is the case for all regular season MLB games unless one has to leave due to injury), each umpire is named for the base at which he is stationed. Sometimes a league will provide six umpires; the extra two are stationed along the outfield foul lines and are called the '''left-field''' and '''right-field umpires''' (or simply '''outfield umpires''').

Outfield umpires are used in major events, such as the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], and depending on the level, at parts of post-season [[playoff]]s. For Major League Baseball, all playoff levels use six umpires, while at lower levels, six umpires are used at the championship games (such as NCAA).&lt;ref name="Special Event selection"&gt;{{cite web |title=Special Event selection |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/feature.jsp?feature=event_selection |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rulings on catches of batted balls are usually made by the umpire closest to the play.

===Crew chief===
The term ''umpire-in-chief'' is not to be confused with the '''crew chief''', who is usually the most experienced umpire in a crew. At the major-league and high minor-league (Class AAA and AA) levels, the crew chief acts as a liaison between the league office and the crew and has a supervisory role over other members of the crew.&lt;ref name="Crews"&gt;{{cite web |title=2007 MLB Umpire Crews |url=http://www.mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/umpires/crews.jsp |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125035536/http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/umpires/crews.jsp |archivedate=2007-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, on the Major League level, "The Crew Chief shall coordinate and direct his crew's compliance with the Office of the Commissioner's rules and policies. Other Crew Chief responsibilities include: leading periodic discussions and reviews of situations, plays and rules with his crew; generally directing the work of the other umpires on the crew, with particular emphasis on uniformity in dealing with unique situations; assigning responsibilities for maintaining time limits during the game; ensuring the timely filing of all required crew reports for incidents such as ejections, brawls and protested games; and reporting to the Office of Commissioner any irregularity in field conditions at any ballpark."&lt;ref name="Crews" /&gt; Thus, on the professional level, some of the duties assigned to the umpire-in-chief (the plate umpire) in the [[Official Baseball Rules]] have been reassigned to the crew chief, regardless of the crew chief's umpiring position during a specific game.

===Judgment calls===
{{seealso|Instant replay#Baseball}}
An umpire's judgment call used to be final, unless the umpire making the call chose to ask his partner(s) for help and then decided to reverse it after the discussion.&lt;ref name="Official rules" /&gt; Since 2014, the MLB allows managers to challenge plays during the game. If the manager successfully has a call overturned, they are rewarded with another challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Replay Review Regulations|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/replay_review.jsp|work=MLB|publisher=MLB|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an umpire seems to make an error in rule interpretation, his call, in some leagues, can be officially protested as is the case in MLB.&lt;ref name="Official rules" /&gt; If the umpire is persistent in his or her interpretation, the matter will be settled at a later time by a league official.

In the early years of professional baseball, umpires were not engaged by the league but rather by agreement between the team captains. However, by the start of the modern era in 1901, this had become a league responsibility. There is now a unitary major league umpiring roster, although until the [[1999 Major League Umpires Association mass resignation|1999 labor dispute]] that led to the decertification of the [[Major League Umpires Association]], there were separate National and American League umpires. As a result of the 2000 collective bargaining agreement between Major League Baseball and the newly formed [[World Umpires Association]], all umpires were placed on one roster and can work in either league.

==Amateur umpiring==
[[File:One Marine Making the Right Calls DVIDS177654.jpg|thumb|right|A volunteer umpire officiating a [[Little League Baseball]] game]]
An amateur umpire officiates non-professional or semi-professional baseball. Many amateur umpires are paid (typically on a per-game basis) and thus might be considered [[professionals]], while some amateur umpires are unpaid. According to the [[Little League Baseball]] official website, umpires should be volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littleleague.org/umpires/umpirerole.htm|title=Umpire's Role|website=www.littleleague.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous organizations that test or train anyone interested in umpiring for local leagues, and can help make connections to the leagues in the area. Little League Baseball and the [[Babe Ruth League]] are two of the most popular organizations when it comes to youth baseball, and each have their own application, test, and training process for becoming an umpire. In Canada, most umpires are certified through a provincial organization, and then hired by local municipal associations through an umpire in chief.

For the [[Little League World Series]], amateur umpires from around the world participate on a volunteer basis. Prospective Little League World Series umpires must participate at various levels of Little League All-Star tournaments, ranging from district to state to regional tournaments, prior to being accepted to work the World Series tournament.&lt;ref name="LL umpires"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.littleleague.org/umpires/index.asp |title=Umpires Home |publisher=[[Little League Baseball]] |accessdate=2007-05-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070425095910/http://www.littleleague.org/umpires/index.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High school umpiring==
High school umpires are part-time umpires; most have other forms of employment. A high school umpire has to go to clinics and rules meetings before becoming an umpire. A person trying to become a high school umpire has to register with their respective state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nchsaa.org/pages/793/officiating-information/#.UnRY9KWMHFI], retrieved November 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; When they register with the state they receive a rulebook, a casebook and an umpire manual. After reading through the rulebooks the umpires meet at clinics and rules meetings to discuss rules and mechanics. Clinics and rules meetings are crucial in an umpire's development. Once an umpire has gone to clinics and rules meetings they then start to umpire scrimmages. In a scrimmage an umpire gets hands on training for the first time. Scrimmages are where young umpires can learn from veteran umpires. After going to clinics and umpiring in scrimmages the umpire then has to take a rule exam. The umpire must pass the exam in order to umpire during the season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernpiedmontbaseball.org/POLICIES.htm], retrieved November 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Once the umpire has passed the exam he/she is now ready to umpire high school level ballgames.

High school umpires are paid per game and the rate differs from state to state. The plate umpire and base umpire are paid the same amount for each game. Umpires in high school games use a two-person crew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernpiedmontbaseball.org/RULES%20&amp;%20MECHANICS.htm], retrieved November 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Three-person and four-person crews may be used in later rounds of the playoffs.

==Umpire training and career development==
Becoming a [[Major League Baseball]] umpire requires rigorous training, and very few succeed. Provided the individual makes satisfactory progress throughout, it typically takes from 7–10 years to achieve MLB status. First, a person desiring to become a professional umpire must attend one of two private umpiring schools authorized by Major League Baseball: [[Minor League Baseball Umpire Training Academy]] or The [[Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School]].&lt;ref name="MiLB umpires"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/umpires.jsp?mc=_ump_schools |title=Where are the Professional Umpire Schools Located? |publisher=[[Minor League Baseball|MiLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both schools are run by former Major League umpires and are located in [[Florida]]. There are no prerequisites for attending these schools; however, there is an [http://www.mlbuc.com Umpire Camp], run by Major League Baseball, that is generally considered a "tool for success" at either of these schools. These camps, offered as two separate one-week sessions, are held in November in Southern California. Top students at these camps are eligible to earn scholarships to either of the professional umpire schools in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/camp/index.jsp?content=faqs|title=MLB Umpire Camps|website=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After five weeks of training, each school sends its top students to the Professional Baseball Umpires Corporation (PBUC) evaluation course also held in Florida.&lt;ref name="minorleaguebaseball1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/umpires.jsp?mc=_ump_career|title=Become an Umpire - MiLB.com Official Info - The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|website=MiLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual number of students sent on to the evaluation course is determined by PBUC with input from the umpire schools.&lt;ref name="minorleaguebaseball1"/&gt; Generally, the top 10 to 20 percent of each school's graduating class will advance to the evaluation course. The evaluation course is conducted by PBUC staff, which differs in personnel from the staff at the respective umpire schools.&lt;ref name="minorleaguebaseball1"/&gt; The evaluation course generally lasts around 10 days. Depending on the number of available positions in the various minor leagues, some (but not all) of the evaluation course attendees will be assigned to a low level [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]]. Out of approximately 300 original umpire school students, about 30-35 will ultimately be offered jobs in Minor League Baseball after the evaluation course.

Professional umpires begin their careers in one of the Rookie or [[Class A (baseball)|Class "A"]] Short-Season leagues, with Class-A being divided into three levels (Short-Season, Long-Season and Advanced "A").&lt;ref name="minorleaguebaseball1"/&gt;  Top umpiring prospects will often begin their careers in a short-season "A" league (for example, the [[New York–Penn League]]), but most will begin in a rookie league (for example, the [[Gulf Coast League]]).

[[File:David Rackley 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Umpire [[David Rackley]] working a [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Texas League]] game in 2006]]
Throughout the season, all minor league umpires in Rookie leagues, Class-A, and Class-AA are evaluated by members of the PBUC staff.&lt;ref name="web.minorleaguebaseball.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/umpires.jsp|title=Umpires - MiLB.com Official Info - The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|website=MiLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All umpires receive a detailed written evaluation of their performance after every season.&lt;ref name="web.minorleaguebaseball.com"/&gt;  In addition, all umpires (except those in the rookie or Short Season Class-A leagues) receive written mid-season evaluations.&lt;ref name="web.minorleaguebaseball.com"/&gt;

Generally, an umpire is regarded as making adequate progress "up the ranks" if he advances up one level of Class "A" ball each year (thus earning promotion to Class AA after three to four years) and promotion to Class AAA after two to three years on the Class AA level. However, this is a very rough estimate and other factors not discussed (such as the number of retirements at higher levels) may dramatically affect these estimates. For example, many umpires saw rapid advancement in 1999 due to the mass resignation of many Major League umpires as a [[collective bargaining]] ploy.

When promoted to the Class AAA level, an umpire's evaluation will also be conducted by the umpiring supervisory staff of Major League Baseball. In recent years, top AAA prospects, in addition to umpiring and being evaluated during the regular season (in either the [[International League|International]] or [[Pacific Coast League]]), have been required to umpire in the [[Arizona Fall League]] where they receive extensive training and evaluation by Major League Baseball staff.

In addition, top AAA prospects may also be rewarded with umpiring only Major League preseason games during spring training (in lieu of Class AAA games). Additionally, the very top prospects may umpire Major League regular season games on a limited basis as "fill-in" umpires (where the Class AAA umpire replaces a sick, injured or vacationing Major League umpire).

Finally, upon the retirement (or firing) of a Major League umpire, a top Class AAA umpire will be promoted to Major League Baseball's permanent umpire staff. During this entire process, if an umpire is evaluated as no longer being a major-league prospect, he will be released, ending his professional career. In all, PBUC estimates that it will take an umpire seven to eight years of professional umpiring before he will be considered for a major league position.&lt;ref name="minorleaguebaseball1"/&gt;

{{As of|2018}}, major league umpires earn $150,000 to $450,000 per year depending on their experience, with a $340 [[per diem]] for hotel and meals.&lt;ref name=brpaid&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2773321-how-much-are-mlb-umpires-paid |title=How Much Are MLB Umpires Paid? |first=Kerry |last=Miller |website=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=May 3, 2018 |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minor league umpires earn from $2,000 to $3,900 per month during the season.&lt;ref name=brpaid/&gt; Amounts vary based on the umpire's classification and experience.

{{As of|2018|3}}, there are 19 four-man crews in MLB, for a total of 76 full-time umpires; they are augmented by 16 Class AAA umpires eligible to umpire regular season games, yielding a total roster of 92 MLB umpires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/roster.jsp |title=Major League Umpire Roster |date=March 2018 |website=[[MLB.com]] |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uniform==
Umpires are often referred as "Blue" because of the color of their uniforms. In the early days of baseball, umpire uniforms resembled suits (usually to keep them inconspicuous when in public) with the only difference being National League umpires wore an inside chest protector while American League umpires wore an outside (or "balloon") protector when calling balls and strikes.

In the 1960s, umpires were allowed to wear dress shirts that were light blue, and the American League umpires wore grey slacks with their blue coats, while National League umpires wore all blue coats and slacks. In 1970, the National League added a large patch on their coat and uniform with the league logo and a number on their left sleeve, along with a short-sleeved light blue shirt for hot summer games. The American League followed suit with the short sleeves in 1972, then in 1973 they wore a maroon blazer along with blue pants until 1979. In 1975, the American League umpire hats included the abbreviation "AL" (previous to that they included a shield for the AL). To celebrate the National League's 100th anniversary in 1976, the umpire blazers/light blue shirts included the league's centennial patch and the hats were designed in the "pillbox" style  with the year "'76" included on them. In 1977, the use of the outside (balloon) protector was outlawed for new umpires but grandfathered for existing umpires, with the last umpire that used the outside protector, [[Jerry Neudecker]], retiring in 1985. The use of ties with the blazers were gradually phased out; the last time they were worn in the World Series was in [[1975 World Series|1975]] and overall was in the [[1979 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] by [[George Maloney]], [[Terry Cooney]], and [[Nick Bremigan]]. In World Series games starting in [[1976 World Series|1976]], the umpires wore sweaters (light blue for National League umpires and off-white for American League umpires) instead of ties.

In 1980, Major League Baseball mandated that the umpires' uniforms be standardized, and they went to the American League pre-1973 style of blue blazers, grey slacks, and short sleeved light blue shirts; the American League began adding numbers to their umpire uniforms, with "AL" on their caps and National League umpires had "NL" on their caps. This style was pretty much the same (except for the use of windbreakers and sweaters later in the 1980s) through 1995. The league initials on the caps changed towards the late 1980s when the "N" and "L" were combined into a single letter, while the "A" and the "L" were interlocked.

In 1996, the button-down light blue shirt was replaced with a navy blue polo shirt with red and white trim on the collar and sleeve cuffs. The numbers were changed to red on the shirts, an "N" with the National League logo and an "A" with the American League logo on the hats. The American League used an optional red short-sleeved shirt (possibly a homage to the 1973-79 red blazers) that wasn't used by many umpires (the notable exceptions were [[Derryl Cousins]] and [[Dale Scott]], who frequently wore the red shirts while working home plate, even as their colleagues on the bases wore navy blue shirts). The National League added a light blue shirt in 1997, which became much more popular than the red shirts in the AL.

Beginning in 2000, after the individual leagues' umpires were consolidated into a single staff, the 1996-99 uniform styles were carried over with "MLB" on the caps instead of the league designations. Since 2001, the uniforms switched to black blazers/windbreakers with grey slacks, with the hats now including the MLB logo (along with the short-sleeved light blue shirts), which remain relatively unchanged. The navy blue shirt was phased out in favor of black, and the light blue shirt was reintroduced after a brief experiment with gray. For the 2017 season, the umpires' jacket is black with light blue trim over the shoulders.

Several ''player'' inductees to the Hall of Fame served as substitute umpires for a small number of games during the early years of baseball; these include [[Hughie Jennings]], [[Willie Keeler]], [[King Kelly]], and [[Chuck Klein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/index.html#Umpires|title=The Directory of Umpires|accessdate=August 28, 2017 |work=Retrosheet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Hall of Fame player inductees [[Tim Keefe]] and [[Ed Walsh]] umpired professionally in the major leagues after their playing careers ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Keefe|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/K/Pkeeft101.htm|work=Retrosheet.org|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ed Walsh|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/W/Pwalse101.htm|work=Retrosheet.org|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numbers retired by the National and American Leagues===
{{see also|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}
Like players, umpires are identified by numbers on their uniforms. National League umpires began wearing numbers in 1970 (though they were assigned numbers in the 1960s) and American League umpires were assigned and began wearing uniform numbers in 1980. The National League umpires' numbers were initially assigned in alphabetical order ([[Al Barlick]] wearing number 1, [[Ken Burkhart]] number 2, etc.) from 1970 to 1978, which meant that an umpire's number could change each year depending on retirements and other staff changes. In 1979, the National League changed the numbering system and thereafter a number's umpire did not change from year to year. At first, as new umpires, they would be assigned higher numbers (for example, in 1979, [[Dave Pallone]], [[Steve Fields]], [[Fred Brocklander]], and [[Lanny Harris]] were assigned numbers 26 to 29 instead of available numbers between 1 and 25). The National League numbering practice changed again in the mid-1980s, when new umpires were assigned previously used numbers (for example, in 1982 [[Gerry Davis (umpire)|Gerry Davis]] was assigned number 12, previously worn by [[Andy Olsen]], and in 1985 [[Tom Hallion]] was assigned number 20, previously worn by [[Ed Vargo]].)

The American League's number assignments were largely random. [[Bill Haller]], the senior American League umpire in 1980, wore number 1 until his retirement following the [[1982 World Series]], but the number was never reassigned.

In 2000, the American League and National League umpiring staffs were merged into a unified staff under the auspices of Major League Baseball, and all numbers were made available, including the numbers that had been retired by one of the leagues. (For example, the American League had retired [[Lou DiMuro]]'s number 16 after his death, but it was made available to his son [[Mike DiMuro|Mike]] after the staffs were unified.) In the event of duplications, the more senior umpire was given the first choice. (For example, [[Al Clark (umpire)|Al Clark]] in the AL and [[Jerry Layne]] in the NL both wore the number 24, but because Clark had more seniority he was assigned 24 and Layne number 26. When Clark was relieved of his duties in 2000, Layne was able to obtain number 24.)

From time to time, Major League Baseball retires those numbers for umpires who have given outstanding service to the game, or in honor of umpires who have died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/feature.jsp?feature=retired_numbers/|title=Umpires: Feature|website=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since unified umpiring crews were established in 2000, all numbers are available to a Major League Baseball umpire, as each retired number was reserved per league. Only one umpire number has been retired since the current format was established, 42, because of the [[Major League Baseball]] policy instituted in 1997.

* #1 [[Bill Klem]] ([[National League|NL]], 1905–41); currently worn by [[Bruce Dreckman]]
* #2 [[Nick Bremigan]] ([[American League|AL]], 1974–89); currently worn by [[Dan Bellino]]
* #2 [[Jocko Conlan]] ([[National League|NL]], 1941–64); worn by [[Jerry Crawford]] during his tenure in the NL (1977–1999)
* #3 [[Al Barlick]] ([[National League|NL]], 1940–43, 1946–55, 1958–71); currently worn by [[Bill Welke]]
* #9 [[Bill Kunkel (baseball)|Bill Kunkel]] ([[American League|AL]], 1968–84); also an NBA referee. Currently worn by [[Brian Gorman]].
* #10 [[John McSherry]] ([[National League|NL]], 1971–1996); died at home plate during the Cincinnati Reds-Montreal Expos season opener. Currently worn by [[Phil Cuzzi]].
* #16 [[Lou DiMuro]] ([[American League|AL]], 1963–82); killed in an auto-related accident after a game in [[Arlington, Texas]]. Currently worn by DiMuro's son [[Mike DiMuro|Mike]].
* #42 [[Jackie Robinson]] (retired by Major League Baseball since April 15, 1997.) Worn by [[Fieldin Culbreth]] in the American League through 1999; Culbreth switched to #25 when a unified umpiring staff was first used in 2000.

==Etymology==
According to the [[Middle English]] [[dictionary]] entry for '''noumpere''', the predecessor of '''umpire''' came from the [[Old French]] '''nonper''' (from '''non''', "not" and '''per,''' "equal"), meaning "one who is requested to act as arbiter of a dispute between two people", or that the arbiter is not paired with anyone in the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/519003/UMPIRE-CAME-FROM-FRENCH-AS-WORD-MEANING-NOT-EQUAL.html |title='Umpire' Came from French as Word Meaning `Not Equal' |agency=[[Merriam-Webster]] |website=[[Deseret News]] |location=[[Salt Lake City]] |date=October 13, 1996 |accessdate=September 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Middle English, the earliest form of this shows up as '''noumper''' around 1350, and the earliest version without the '''n''' shows up as '''owmpere,''' a variant spelling in Middle English, circa 1440.

The '''n''' was lost after it was written (in 1426–1427) as '''a noounpier''' with the '''a''' being the indefinite article. The leading '''n''' became attached to the article, changing it to '''an Oumper''' around 1475; this sort of linguistic shift is called [[false splitting]]. Thus today one says "an umpire" instead of "a numpire".

The word was applied to the officials of many sports other than baseball, including [[association football]] (where it has been superseded by ''referee'') and [[Umpire (cricket)|cricket]] (which still uses it).
