The '''A588''' is a road in England, which runs from [[Poulton-le-Fylde]] to [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] in [[Lancashire]]. It is the main route serving the [[Over Wyre]] areas of [[the Fylde]].

The road runs a total distance of {{convert|20|mi|0}}, in a roughly north-easterly direction, and is largely rural in character. It begins at a junction with the [[A586 road|A586]] in Poulton-le-Fylde {{nowrap|({{coord|53.8436|-2.9922|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A588 road (southern end)}}),}} and runs {{convert|1|mi|0}} north-east, as Breck Road, to meet the [[A585 road|A585]] eastbound at the River Wyre [[roundabout]]. After sharing with the [[A585 road|A585]] as Mains Lane for {{convert|0.5|mi|1}}, it turns north (left) away from the A585, crossing the [[River Wyre]] at [[Shard Bridge]], the last crossing of the river before its estuary. From here the road winds through the Over-Wyre villages of [[Hambleton, Lancashire|Hambleton]], [[Stalmine]] and [[Pilling]] and across the [[marsh]]y land that abuts the Cockerham Sands portion of [[Morecambe Bay]]. At [[Cockerham]], almost {{convert|12|mi|0}} from Shard Bridge, the road turns to the left, and, as Lancaster Road, runs a further {{convert|6|mi|0}} north into Lancaster, eventually terminating as it joins the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]] by the Royal Lancaster Infirmary {{nowrap|({{coord|54.0416|-2.7969|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A588 road (northern end)}}).}}

'''ASCI Blue Pacific''' was a [[supercomputer]] installed at the [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in [[Livermore, CA]] at the end of 1998. It was a collaboration between [[IBM]] Corporation and Lawerence Livermore Lab.

It was an [[IBM System p|IBM RS6000 SP]] ''[[massively parallel]] processing'' system. It contained 5,856 [[PowerPC 600#PowerPC 604e|PowerPC 604e]] [[microprocessor]]s. Its theoretical top performance was 3.9 [[teraflops]]. 

It was built as a stage of the [[Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative]] (ASCI) started by the U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] to build a simulator to replace live [[nuclear weapon]] testing following the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|moratorium]] on testing started by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1992 and extended by [[Bill Clinton]] in 1993.

'''''A Wealth of Fable''''' by [[Harry Warner, Jr.]], is a [[Hugo Awards|Hugo Award]]-winning history of [[science fiction fandom]] of the 1950s, an essential reference work in the field.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news | last =Platou | first =Arnold S. |  title = Harry Warner's parallel universe| work = [[Herald Mail|The Herald-Mail]] | publisher = | date = March 31, 2003 | url =http://articles.herald-mail.com/2003-03-31/news/25137739_1_joe-siclari-fanzines-harry-warner | accessdate = March 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a followup to Warner's ''[[All Our Yesterdays (book)|All Our Yesterdays]]'' ({{ISBN|1-886778-13-2}}), which covered the 1940s, and helped to earn Warner a Hugo Award in 1969.

According to science fiction fan and author [[Mike Resnick]], "It's not even a sequel, but rather a continuation, of ''All Our Yesterdays,'' heavily illustrated, obviously written by the same hand, chock full of the anecdotes that almost instantly become fannish legend."&lt;ref name=Resnick&gt;{{cite web|last=Resnick |first=Mike |title=The Literature of Fandom |work=[[Jim Baen's Universe]], 11 Vol 2 Num 5 |publisher= |date=February 2008 |url=http://baens-universe.com/articles/The_Literature_of_Fandom |accessdate=March 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430184534/http://www.baens-universe.com/articles/The_Literature_of_Fandom |archivedate=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally published by Joe Siclari in a three-volume, [[mimeograph]]ed Fanhistorica Press edition in 1977. [[SCIFI Press]] brought out an expanded hardcover edition ({{ISBN|0-9633099-0-0}}) in 1992.&lt;ref name=Resnick /&gt; The members of the [[World Science Fiction Society]] voted that version the [[Hugo Award for Best Related Book]].

Warner also wrote a related series of historical columns called "All Our Yesterdays."

'''Anita Conti''' (''née'' '''Caracotchian''') (17 May 1899 – 25 December 1997) was a [[France|French]] [[explorer]] and [[photographer]], and the first French female [[Oceanography|oceanographer]].

==Biography==
Anita Caracotchian was born in [[Ermont]] in [[Seine-et-Oise]] to a wealthy [[Armenia]]n family. She spent her childhood being educated at home by different tutors and travelling with her family, gradually developing a passion for books and the sea.

After moving to [[Paris]], she concentrated on writing poems and the art of book binding. Her work got the attention of  celebrities and she won different awards and prizes for her creativity in [[London]], Paris, [[New York City|New York]] and [[Brussels]].

In 1927, she married a diplomat, Marcel Conti, and started traveling around the world, exploring the seas, documenting and reporting what she saw and experimented. Spending time on the fishing boats for days and even months on certain occasions gave her a deeper understanding of the problematic faced by the fishermen. In between the two world war, she developed the technique of fishing maps apart from the already used navigational charts. For two years, from one vessel to another, she observed the French fishermen along the coast and [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Saharan Africa]] discovering fish species unknown in [[France]]. She published many scientific reports on the negative effects of industrial fishing and the different problems related to fishing practices.

From 1943 and approximately for 10 years, she studied in the Mauritian islands, [[Senegal]], [[Guinea]] and [[Ivory Coast]], the nature of the seabed, different fish species and their nutritional values in regards of protein deficiency for the local populations. Gradually, she developed better preservation techniques, fishing methods and installed artificial dens for further studies. She  even founded an experimental fishery for sharks. She became more and more conscientious of the misuse of natural resources by the fishing industry and the major waste that could be prevented.

In 1971 she published ''L’Ocean, Les Betes et L’Homme'', to denounce the disaster that men create and its effects on the oceans. Through many conferences and forums and for the rest of her life, she advocated for the betterment of the marine world.

She died on 25 December 1997 in [[Douarnenez]].

'''Bortolo d'Alvise''' was a 16th-century [[Italy|Italian]] scientific instrument maker.

He was a [[Venice|Venetian]] [[glassmaker]] who, thanks to the negotiations by Grand Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici]] (1519&amp;ndash;1574) with the [[Venetian Republic]], was called to [[Florence]] as a crystal-maker. He was documented in Florence as early as September 1569, and along with Jacomo and Alvise Della Luna was one of the finest Venetian glassmakers to settle in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Ilardi, Vincent. Renaissance vision from spectacles to telescopes. Vol. 259. American Philosophical Society, 2007. p184&lt;/ref&gt; He remained there for about fourteen years, where he introduced new techniques. The inventory of his workshop records ''reticello'' (filigree) glass, engraved glass, ice glass, a gilded tray, and weave-pattern vases with handles.

{{Anthropology |concepts}}

'''Development anthropology''' refers to the [[Applied anthropology|application of anthropological]] perspectives to the [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] branch of [[development studies]]. It takes [[international development]] and international [[aid]] as primary objects. In this branch of [[anthropology]], the term ''development'' refers to the social action made by different agents (e.g. [[institution]]s, [[business]]es, [[State (polity)|states]], or independent [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s) who are trying to modify the [[Economy|economic]], technical, political, or/and social life of a given place in the world, especially in [[Poverty|impoverished]], formerly colonized regions.

Development anthropologists share a commitment to simultaneously critique and contribute to projects and institutions that create and administer [[Western culture|Western]] projects that seek to improve the economic well-being of the most [[Marginalization|marginalized]], and to eliminate poverty. While some theorists distinguish between the [[anthropology of development]] (in which development is the object of study) and development anthropology (as an applied practice), this distinction is increasingly thought of as obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]], 1995, ''Encountering Development, the making and unmaking of the Third World'', Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; With researches on the field, the anthropologist can describe, analyze, and understand the different actions of development that took and take place in a given place. The various impacts on the local population, environment, society, and economy are to be examined.

==History==

In 1971, Glynn Cochrane proposed development anthropology as a new field for practitioners interested in a career outside academia.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''Development Anthropology'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, (ed.) ''What can we do for each other, An Interdisciplinary Approach to Development Anthropology'', (Amsterdam: Grüner, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Given the growing complexity of development assistance, Cochrane suggested that graduates needed to prepare themselves to work in interdisciplinary settings.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, "Policy Studies and Anthropology", in ''[[Current Anthropology]]'', Vol. 21, No., 4, August, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Cochrane was invited by the [[World Bank]] to make recommendations for the use of anthropology, and his report&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''The Use of Anthropology in Project Operations of the World Bank Group'', (World Bank/IMF, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; (which stressed the need for the systematic treatment of social issues) laid a foundation for future use of the discipline in the [[World Bank Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goodlund, ''Social and Environmental Assessment to Promote Sustainability, an Informal View from the World Bank'', (Glasgow: International Association for Impact Assessment, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Around ninety anthropologists are now employed by the World Bank Group in various roles.

In 1974, Bob Berg—of the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID)—and Cochrane worked together, and, as a result, USAID introduced "social soundness analysis" as a project preparation requirement. This innovation led to the employment of more than seventy anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Hoben, "Anthropologists and Development", in ''[[Annual Review of Anthropology]]'', Vol. 11: 349-375 (Volume publication date October 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''The Cultural Appraisal of Development Projects'', (New York: Praeger, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Social soundness analysis has now been in USAID use for over forty years. USAID ran an in-house development studies course in the 1970s, through which several hundred field personnel eventually passed. In addition to anthropology, the course covered development [[economics]], regional and national planning, and institution building.

In the late 1970s, Thayer Scudder, Michael Horowitz,  and David Brokensha established an Institute for Development Anthropology at the [[State University of New York]] at Binghamton. This institute has played an influential role in the continuing expansion of this branch of the discipline.

By the 1980s and 1990s, development anthropology began to be more widely used in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Cochrane, ''Festival Elephants and the Myth of Global Poverty'', (New York: Pearson, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate social responsibility and issues ranging from resettlement and [[human rights]] to [[micro-enterprise]] are now routinely addressed by systematic social assessment as an integral part of investment appraisal.

==Development criticism==
{{see also|Development criticism}}

Criticism of Western development became an important goal in the late 1980s, after the wake of severe economic crisis brought disease, poverty, and [[starvation]] to countries and sectors that were the focus of large Western [[structural adjustment]] development projects throughout [[Latin America]], [[Africa]], and other parts of the former colonial world. Despite the failure of many of these development projects, and some 40 years of post [[World War II]] funding from the US and Europe, scholars know{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} that development has been the key way that Western post-industrialized countries intervene in non-Western society. Development criticism seeks to discover why, given the funds and best intentions of volunteers and policy makers, do the majority of development projects continue to fail to (1) redistribute economic power and resources in a way that helps the poorest sectors of society, and (2) to create economic growth that is sustainable in the country.

Anthropologists who study development projects themselves have criticized the fundamental structure of Western development projects coming from such institutions as USAID and bilateral lenders such as the World Bank. Because they are often working from the perspective of the objects of development in the non-Western world, rather than from within the aid institutions, anthropologists encountering such projects have a unique perspective from which to see the problems. Anthropologists write with concern about the ways that non-Western objects of aid have been left out of the widespread drive to develop after World War II, especially in the ways that such projects limit solutions to poverty in the form of narrow Western [[Capitalism|capitalist]] models that promote exploitation and the destruction of household farms, or, more suspiciously, naturalise inequality between Western post-industrialized countries and former colonial subjects.

Some describe the anthropological critique of development as one that pits [[modernization]] and an eradication of the indigenous culture, but this is too reductive and not the case with the majority of scholarly work. In fact, most anthropologists who work in impoverished areas desire the same economic relief for the people they study as policymakers; however, they are wary about the assumptions and models on which development interventions are based. Anthropologists and others who critique development projects instead view Western development itself as a product of Western culture that must be refined in order to better help those it claims to aid. The problem therefore is not that of markets driving out culture, but of the fundamental blind-spots of Western developmental culture itself. Criticism often focuses therefore on the cultural bias and blind-spots of Western development institutions, or modernization models that systematically represent non-Western societies as more deficient than the West; erroneously assume that Western modes of production and historical processes are repeatable in all contexts; or that do not take into account hundreds of years of colonial exploitation by the West that has tended to destroy the resources of former colonial society. Most critically, anthropologists argue that [[sustainable development]] requires at the very least more involvement of the people who the project aims to target in the project's creation, its management, and its decision-making processes.

A major critique of development from anthropologists came from [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]]'s seminal book ''[[Encountering Development]]'', which argued that Western development largely exploited non-Western peoples and enacted an [[Orientalism]] (see [[Edward Said]]). Escobar&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Escobar, 1995, ''Encountering Development, the making and unmaking of the Third World'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; even sees international development as a means for the [[Western world|Occident]] to keep control over the resources of former colonies. Escobar shows that, between 1945 and 1960, the former colonies were going through the [[decolonization]] era, and the development plan helped to maintain the third world's dependency on the old [[metropole]]. Development projects themselves flourished in the wake of World War II, and during the [[Cold War]], when they were developed to (1) stop the spread of [[communism]] with the spread of capitalist markets, and (2) create more prosperity for the West and its products by creating a global consumer demand for finished Western products abroad. Some scholars blame the different agents for having only considered a small aspect of the local people's lives without analyzing broader consequences, while others like [[dependency theory]] or Escobar argue that development projects are doomed to failure for the fundamental ways they privilege Western industry and corporations. Escobar's argument echos the earlier work of dependency theory and follows a larger critique more recently posed by [[Michel Foucault]] and other [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralists]].

More recent studies like [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]]'s ''[[The Anti-Politics Machine]]'' argue that the ideas and institutional structure that support Western development projects are fundamentally flawed because of the way the West continues to represent the former colonial world. International development uses an "anti-politics" that ultimately produces failure, despite the best intentions. Finally, studies also point out how development efforts often attempt to de-politicize change by a focus on instrumental assistance (like a school building) but not on the objective conditions that led to the development failure (e.g., the state's neglect of rural children at the expense of urban elite), nor the content of what the school might or might not teach. In this sense, the critique of international development focuses on the insidious effects of projects that at the least offer band-aids that address symptoms but not causes, and that at the worst promote projects that systematically redirect economic resources and profit to the West.

== Applied anthropology in development ==
While anthropological studies critique the Western assumptions and political context of development projects, anthropologists also consult on and work within aid institutions in the creation and implementation of development projects. While economists look at aggregate measures like [[gross national product]] and [[per capita income]], as well as measures of [[income distribution]] and [[economic inequality]] in a society, anthropologists can provide a more fine-grained analysis of the qualitative information behind these numbers, such as the nature of the social groups involved and the social significance of the composition of income. Thus, development anthropologists often deal with assessing the important qualitative aspects of development sometimes ignored by an economic approach.

'''District Regionalism''' is a finance-related [[urban planning]] method. The practice creates a neighborhood stock system in which community shares are sold. The term "District Regionalism" was initially used by the administration of the city of [[Guthrie, Kentucky]] as the distinctive traits of each neighborhood emerged during the trial study. The [[University of Kentucky]]'s College of Design became instrumental in devising the study concept, parameters and goals. The practice concerns organizing cities into smaller communities by allowing creating and distinctive regional and cultural references emerge within neighborhoods by allowing the public to transform what is typically considered as government owned areas and [[Blight (urban)|blighted]] properties. The practice has been proven to alter larger sprawling co-dependant cities into smaller self-reliant communities.

== Share System ==
Community shares are sold in District Regionalist environments.{{clarify|date=October 2013}}  As a community is defined by boundaries and image, the collective population of that community issues shares with monetary value. Initially, stock ownership is given to the community in order to promote the process. An increased number of shares allows a larger amount of voting privileges within that community, therefore allowing some margin within [[city ordinance]]s and [[zoning]].  As more community shares are sold, the pool increases for that community allowing them greater ability to project that money towards community projects. In a District Regionalist community, the city never loses over 51% of shares, allowing the city government to retain rights to city property and have majority rule voting privileges.  As improvements are made to community properties, land values increase and improve the value of private properties within those districts. Cities can also use the community district funding pool to match grants at the discretion of a district's approval.  The share system operates on the premise that communities will care for what they own, as opposed to caring for properties owned by cities.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[Image:moderncityhall.jpg|thumb|right|View of downtown Guthrie, Kentucky showing the redesigned street scape {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;

The existence and nature of '''emotions in animals''' are believed to be correlated with those of humans and to have evolved from the same mechanisms. [[Charles Darwin]] was one of the first scientists to write about the subject, and his observational (and sometimes anecdotal) approach has since developed into a more robust, hypothesis-driven, scientific approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=J.|last=Panksepp|title=Toward a general psychobiological theory of emotions|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=5|issue=3|year=1982|pages=407–422|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00012759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2010/7165.html|title=Emotions help animals to make choices (press release)|year=2010|publisher=University of Bristol|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Animals, Ethics and Trade: The Challenge of Animal Sentience|editor1=Jacky Turner |editor2=Joyce D'Silva |year=2006|publisher=Earthscan|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Jl6cejHNQQUC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=animal%20emotions%20&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q=animal%20emotions&amp;f=false|accessdate=October 26, 2013|isbn=9781844072545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=grief-creature-compassion-how-to-identify-grief-in-animals|author=Wong, K.|title=How to identify grief in animals|publisher=Scientific American|year=2013|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognitive bias]] tests and [[learned helplessness]] models, have shown feelings of optimism and pessimism in a wide range of species including rats, dogs, cats, rhesus macaques, sheep, chicks, starlings, pigs, and honeybees.&lt;ref name="Rygula" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=C.|last2=Bateson|last1=Douglas|first2=M.last2=Bateson|first3=C.|last3=Walsh|first4=A.|last4=Béduéc|first5=S.A.|last5=Edwards|title=Environmental enrichment induces optimistic cognitive biases in pigs|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=139|issue=1–2|year=2012|pages=65–73|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2012.02.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bateson" /&gt;

Some [[Behaviourism|behaviourist]]s, such as [[John B. Watson]], claim that [[stimulus–response model]]s provide a sufficient explanation for animal behaviours that have been described as emotional, and that all behaviour, no matter how complex, can be reduced to a simple stimulus-response association.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behaviorism (Revised Ed.)|last=Watson|first=J. B.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1930|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John B. Watson|Watson]] described that the purpose of psychology was "to predict, given the stimulus, what reaction will take place; or given the reaction, state what the situation or stimulus is that has caused the reaction".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Etymology, definitions, and differentiation==
The word "emotion" dates back to 1579, when it was adapted from the French word ''émouvoir'', which means "to stir up". However, the earliest precursors of the word likely date back to the very origins of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Merriam-Webster|title=The Merriam-Webster dictionary (11th ed.)|year=2004|publisher=Author|location=Springfield, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotions have been described as discrete and consistent responses to internal or external events which have a particular significance for the organism.  Emotions are brief in duration and consist of a coordinated set of responses, which may include [[physiological]], [[behavioural]], and [[neural]] mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox |first=E. |title=Emotion Science: An Integration of Cognitive and Neuroscientific Approaches |year=2008 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |isbn=978-0-230-00517-4 |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotions have also been described as the result of [[evolution]] because they provided good solutions to ancient and recurring problems that faced ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ekman |first=P. |title=An argument for basic emotions |journal=Cognition and Emotion |year=1992 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=169–200 |doi=10.1080/02699939208411068|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laterality===
It has been proposed that negative, withdrawal-associated emotions are processed predominantly by the right hemisphere, whereas the left hemisphere is largely responsible for processing positive, approach-related emotions.  This has been called the "laterality-[[Valence (psychology)|valence]] hypothesis".&lt;ref name="Barnard2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barnard, S., Matthews, L., Messori, S., Podaliri-Vulpiani, M. and Ferri, N.|year=2015|title=Laterality as an indicator of emotional stress in ewes and lambs during a separation test|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=19|issue=1|pages=1–8| doi = 10.1007/s10071-015-0928-3|pmid=26433604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic and complex human emotions===
In humans, a distinction is sometimes made between "basic" and "complex" emotions.  Six emotions have been classified as basic: [[anger]], [[disgust]], [[fear]], [[happiness]], [[sadness]] and [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]].&lt;ref name=Handel&gt;{{cite web |last=Handel |first=S. |title=Classification of Emotions |url=http://www.theemotionmachine.com/classification-of-emotions |accessdate=30 April 2012|date=2011-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Complex emotions would include [[contempt]], [[jealousy]] and [[sympathy]]. However, this distinction is difficult to maintain, and animals are often said to express even the complex emotions.&lt;ref name="Dawkins2000" /&gt;

==Background==

===Behaviourist approach===
[[File:Mother's love.jpg|thumbnail|A [[Indian palm squirrel|squirrel]] communicating with its pup]]
Prior to the development of animal sciences such as [[comparative psychology]] and [[ethology]], interpretation of animal behaviour tended to favour a minimalistic approach known as [[behaviourism]].  This approach refuses to ascribe to an animal a capability beyond the least demanding that would explain a behaviour; anything more than this is seen as unwarranted [[anthropomorphism]]. The behaviourist argument is, why should humans postulate consciousness and all its near-human implications in animals to explain some behaviour, if mere [[stimulus-response]] is a sufficient explanation to produce the same effects?

The cautious wording of Dixon exemplifies this viewpoint:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=B.|year=2001|title=Animal emotions. Ethics and the Environment|volume=6|issue=2|pages=22–30|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/access.cgi?uri=/journals/ethics_and_the_environment/v006/6.2dixon.html|doi=10.2979/ete.2001.6.2.22|journal=Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Cquote|Recent work in the area of [[ethics]] and animals suggests that it is philosophically legitimate to ascribe emotions to animals. Furthermore, it is sometimes argued that emotionality is a morally relevant psychological state shared by humans and non humans. What is missing from the philosophical literature that makes reference to emotions in animals is an attempt to clarify and defend some particular account of the nature of emotion, and the role that emotions play in a characterization of human nature. I argue in this paper that some analyses of emotion are more credible than others. Because this is so, the thesis that humans and nonhumans share emotions may well be a more difficult case to make than has been recognized thus far.}}

[[Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson|Moussaieff Masson]] and McCarthy describe a similar view (with which they disagree):&lt;ref name="Moussaieff"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moussaieff Masson|first1=J.|last2=McCarthy|first2= S.|year=1996|title=When Elephants Weep: The Emotional Lives of Animals|publisher=Delta|isbn=978-0-385-31428-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Cquote|While the study of emotion is a respectable field, those who work in it are usually academic psychologists who confine their studies to human emotions. The standard reference work, ''The Oxford Companion to Animal Behaviour'', advises animal behaviourists that "One is well advised to study the behaviour, rather than attempting to get at any underlying emotion. There is considerable uncertainty and difficulty related to the [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] and [[ambiguity]] of emotion: an animal may make certain movements and sounds, and show certain brain and chemical signals when its body is damaged in a particular way. But does this mean an animal feels—is [[awareness|''aware'']] of—pain as we are, or does it merely mean it is programmed to act a certain way with certain stimuli? Similar questions can be asked of any activity an animal (including a human) might undertake, in principle. Many scientists regard all emotion and cognition (in humans and animals) as having a purely mechanistic basis.}}

Because of the [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions of [[consciousness]] and [[mind]] that are involved, many scientists have stayed away from examining animal and human emotion, and have instead studied measurable brain functions through [[neuroscience]].

===Comparative approach===
In 1903, [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] published [[Morgan's Canon]], a specialised form of [[Occam's razor]] used in [[ethology]], in which he stated:&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare|editor1=D.S. Mills |editor2=J.N. Marchant-Forde |publisher=CABI|year=2010|isbn=978-0851997247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Morgan, C.L.|year=1903|title=An Introduction to Comparative Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher=W. Scott, London|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Cquote|In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes,&lt;br&gt; if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development.}}

===Darwin's approach===
[[Charles Darwin]] initially planned to include a chapter on emotion in [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|''The Descent of Man'']] but as his ideas progressed they expanded into a book, ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.&lt;ref name="Darwin 1872"&gt;Darwin, C. (1872).  ''The Expression Of The Emotions In Man And Animals''. University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin proposed that emotions are adaptive and serve a communicative and motivational function, and he stated three principles that are useful in understanding emotional expression: First, ''The Principle of Serviceable Habits'' takes a [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] stance by suggesting that emotional expressions that are useful will be passed on to the offspring. Second, ''The Principle of Antithesis'' suggests that some expressions exist merely because they oppose an expression that is useful. Third, ''The Principle of the Direct Action of the Excited Nervous System on the Body'' suggests that emotional expression occurs when nervous energy has passed a threshold and needs to be released.&lt;ref name="Darwin 1872" /&gt;

Darwin saw emotional expression as an outward communication of an inner state, and the form of that expression often carries beyond its original adaptive use. For example, Darwin remarks that humans often present their canine teeth when sneering in rage, and he suggests that this means that a human ancestor probably utilized their teeth in aggressive action.&lt;ref&gt;Hess, U. and Thibault, P., (2009). ''Darwin and emotion expression.'' American Psychological Association, 64(2): 120-128.[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=d1fb60f0-8b0d-42c6-b3a0-662c059c3725%40sessionmgr111&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=36872968]&lt;/ref&gt; A domestic dog's simple tail wag may be used in subtly different ways to convey many meanings as illustrated in Darwin's ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' published in 1872.

===Anecdotal approach===
Evidence for emotions in animals has been primarily anecdotal, from individuals who interact with pets or captive animals on a regular basis. However, critics of animals having emotions often suggest that anthropomorphism is a motivating factor in the interpretation of the observed behaviours. Much of the debate is caused by the difficulty in defining emotions and the cognitive requirements thought necessary for animals to experience emotions in a similar way to humans.&lt;ref name="Dawkins2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dawkins|first=M.|year=2000|title=Animal minds and animal emotions|journal=American Zoologist|volume=40|issue=6|pages=883–888|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=2b9b11e6-d41d-4a82-9f23-ac4c6c1657d%40sessionmgr115&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=4385376|doi=10.1668/0003-1569(2000)040[0883:amaae]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is made more problematic by the difficulties in testing for emotions in animals. What is known about human emotion is almost all related or in relation to human communication.

===Scientific approach===
In recent years, the scientific community has become increasingly supportive of the idea of emotions in animals. Scientific research has provided insight into similarities of physiological changes between humans and animals when experiencing emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scruton|first1=R|last2=Tyler|first2=A.|year=2001|title=Debate: Do animals have rights?|journal=The Ecologist|volume=31|issue=2|pages=20–23|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/234917337/fulltext?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much support for animal emotion and its expression results from the notion that feeling emotions doesn't require significant cognitive processes,&lt;ref name="Dawkins2000" /&gt; rather, they could be motivated by the processes to act in an adaptive way, as suggested by Darwin.  Recent attempts in studying emotions in animals have led to new constructions in experimental and information gathering. Professor Marian Dawkins suggested that emotions could be studied on a functional or a mechanistic basis.  Dawkins suggests that merely mechanistic or functional research will provide the answer on its own, but suggests that a mixture of the two would yield the most significant results.

====Functional====
Functional approaches rely on understanding what roles emotions play in humans and examining that role in animals. A widely used framework for viewing emotions in a functional context is that described by Oatley and Jenkins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oately|first1=K.|last2=Jenkins|first2=J.M.|year=1996|title=Understanding Emotions|publisher=Blackwell Publishers. Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-55786-495-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; who see emotions as having three stages: (i) appraisal in which there is a conscious or unconscious evaluation of an event as relevant to a particular goal. An emotion is positive when that goal is advanced and negative when it is impeded (ii) action readiness where the emotion gives priority to one or a few kinds of action and may give urgency to one so that it can interrupt or compete with others and (iii) physiological changes, facial expression and then behavioural action.  The structure, however, may be too broad and could be used to include all the animal [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] as well as some plants.&lt;ref name="Dawkins2000" /&gt;

====Mechanistic====
The second approach, mechanistic, requires an examination of the mechanisms that drive emotions and search for similarities in animals.

The mechanistic approach is utilized extensively by Paul, Harding and Mendl. Recognizing the difficulty in studying emotion in non-verbal animals, Paul et al. demonstrate possible ways to better examine this. Observing the mechanisms that function in human emotion expression, Paul et al. suggest that concentration on similar mechanisms in animals can provide clear insights into the animal experience. They noted that in humans, [[cognitive bias]]es vary according to emotional state and suggested this as a possible starting point to examine animal emotion. They propose that researchers may be able to use controlled stimuli which have a particular meaning to trained animals to induce particular emotions in these animals and assess which types of basic emotions animals can experience.&lt;ref name="Paul2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paul|first1=E|last2=Harding|first2=E|last3=Mendl|first3=M|year=2005|title=Measuring emotional processes in animals: the utility of a cognitive approach|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=29|issue=3|pages=469–491|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763405000084|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2005.01.002|pmid=15820551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cognitive bias test====
{{main|Cognitive bias in animals}}
[[File:Glass-of-water.jpg|thumb|150px|Is the glass half empty or half full?]]
A cognitive bias is a pattern of deviation in judgment, whereby inferences about other animals and situations may be drawn in an illogical fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Haselton, M. G. |author2=Nettle, D. |author3= Andrews, P. W. |last-author-amp=yes |title=The evolution of cognitive bias.|year=2005|publisher=Hoboken, NJ, US: John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc|location=In D. M. Buss (Ed.), The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|pages=724–746}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals create their own "subjective social reality" from their perception of the input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bless, H. |author2=Fiedler, K. |author3= Strack, F. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Social cognition: How individuals construct social reality.|year=2004|publisher=Hove and New York: Psychology Press|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the question "[[Is the glass half empty or half full?]]", used as an indicator of optimism or pessimism.
To test this in animals, an individual is trained to anticipate that stimulus A, e.g. a 20&amp;nbsp;Hz tone, precedes a positive event, e.g. highly desired food is delivered when a lever is pressed by the animal.  The same individual is trained to anticipate that stimulus B, e.g. a 10&amp;nbsp;Hz tone, precedes a negative event, e.g. bland food is delivered when the animal presses a lever. The animal is then tested by being played an intermediate stimulus C, e.g. a 15&amp;nbsp;Hz tone, and observing whether the animal presses the lever associated with the positive or negative reward, thereby indicating whether the animal is in a positive or negative mood.  This might be influenced by, for example, the type of housing the animal is kept in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harding|first1=EJ|last2=Paul|first2=ES|last3=Mendl|first3=M|year=2004|title=Animal behaviour: cognitive bias and affective state|journal=Nature|volume=427|issue=6972|pages=312|doi=10.1038/427312a|pmid=14737158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this approach, it has been found that rats which are subjected to either handling or playful, experimenter-administered manual stimulation ([[tickling]]) showed different responses to the intermediate stimulus: rats exposed to tickling were more optimistic.&lt;ref name="Rygula"&gt;{{cite journal|
first1=R|last1=Rygula|first2=H|last2=Pluta|last3=P|first3=Popik|title=laughing rats are optimistic|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=12|pages=e51959|pmc=3530570|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051959|pmid=23300582}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors stated that they had demonstrated "...for the first time a link between the directly measured positive affective state and decision making under uncertainty in an animal model."

Cognitive biases have been shown in a wide range of species including rats, dogs, rhesus macaques, sheep, chicks, starlings and honeybees.&lt;ref name="Rygula" /&gt;

====Self-medication with psychoactive drugs====
Humans can suffer from a range of emotional or mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, fear and panic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malhi|first=Gin S|last2=Baune|first2=Berhard T|last3=Porter|first3=Richard J|date=December 2015|title=Re-Cognizing mood disorders|journal=Bipolar Disorders|language=en|volume=17|pages=1–2|doi=10.1111/bdi.12354|pmid=26688286|issn=1398-5647}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To treat these disorders, scientists have developed a range of [[psychoactive]] drugs such as [[anxiolytic]]s.  Many of these drugs are [[Animal testing|developed and tested]] by using a range of laboratory species.  It is inconsistent to argue that these drugs are effective in treating human emotions whilst denying the experience of these emotions in the laboratory animals on which they have been developed and tested.

Standard laboratory cages prevent mice from performing several natural behaviours for which they are highly motivated. As a consequence, laboratory mice sometimes develop abnormal behaviours indicative of emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety. To improve welfare, these cages are sometimes enriched with items such as nesting material, shelters and running wheels.  Sherwin and Ollson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sherwin|first1=C.M.|last2=Olsson|first2=I.A.S.|year=2004|title=Housing conditions affect self-administration of anxiolytic by laboratory mice.|journal=Animal Welfare|volume=13|pages=33–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; tested whether such enrichment influenced the consumption of [[Midazolam]], a drug widely used to treat anxiety in humans.  Mice in standard cages, standard cages but with unpredictable husbandry, or enriched cages, were given a choice of drinking either non-drugged water or a solution of the Midazolam.  Mice in the standard and unpredictable cages drank a greater proportion of the anxiolytic solution than mice from enriched cages, indicating that mice from the standard and unpredictable laboratory caging may have been experiencing greater anxiety than mice from the enriched cages.

====Spindle neurons====
[[Spindle neuron]]s are specialised cells found in three very restricted regions of the human brain  – the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], the [[frontoinsular cortex]] and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name="Fajardo"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Von Economo neurons are present in the dorsolateral (dysgranular) prefrontal cortex of humans |first7=H. |last7=Pimienta |first6=M.F. |last6=Casanova |first5=J. |last5=Umbarila |first4=G. |last4=Arteaga |first3=E. |last3=Buriticá |first2=M.I. |volume=435 |issue=3 |pages=215–218 |date=4 March 2008 |last2=Escobar |journal=Neuroscience Letters |pmid=18355958|doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2008.02.048|last=Fajardo |first=C. |displayauthors=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two of these areas regulate emotional functions such as empathy, speech, intuition, rapid "gut reactions" and social organization in humans.&lt;ref name="Hof2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hof|first1=P.R.|last2=Van Der Gucht|first2=E.|year=2007|title=Structure of the cerebral cortex of the humpback whale, ''Megaptera novaeangliae'' (Cetacea, Mysticeti, Balaenopteridae)|journal=Anatomical Record Part A|volume=290|pages=1–31|doi=10.1002/ar.20407|pmid=17441195|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spindle neurons are also found in the brains of [[humpback whale]]s, [[fin whale]]s, [[killer whale]]s, [[sperm whale]]s,&lt;ref name="Hof2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn10661&amp;print=tru |title=Whales boast the brain cells that 'make us human' |date=27 November 2006 |work=[[New Scientist]] |author=Coghlan, A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bottlenose dolphin]], [[Risso's dolphin]], [[beluga whale]]s,&lt;ref name="Butti"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19412956 | last1 = Butti | first1 = C| doi=10.1002/cne.22055 | last2 = Sherwood | first2 = CC | last3 = Hakeem | first3 = AY | last4 = Allman | first4 = JM | last5 = Hof | first5 = PR | title = Total number and volume of Von Economo neurons in the cerebral cortex of cetaceans. | journal = The Journal of Comparative Neurology | volume=515 | issue=2 |date=July 2009 | pages=243–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[African Elephant|African]] and [[Asian elephant]]s.&lt;ref name="Hakeemetal"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hakeem | first1 = A.

Whales have spindle cells in greater numbers and are maintained for twice as long as humans.&lt;ref name="Hof2007" /&gt; The exact function of spindle cells in whale brains is still not understood, but Hof and Van Der Gucht believe that they act as some sort of "high-speed connections that fast-track information to and from other parts of the cortex".&lt;ref name="Hof2007" /&gt; They compared them to express trains that bypass unnecessary connections, enabling organisms to instantly process and act on emotional cues during complex social interactions.  However, Hof and Van Der Gucht clarify that they do not know the nature of such feelings in these animals and that we cannot just apply what we see in great apes or ourselves to whales.  They believe that more work is needed to know whether emotions are the same for humans and whales.

====Vocalisations====
From at least the time of Darwin, it has been known that chimpanzees and other great apes also perform a laugh-like vocalization.

Research with rats has revealed that under particular conditions, they emit 50-kHz [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] vocalisations (USV) which have been postulated to reflect a positive [[Affect (psychology)|affective state]] (emotion) analogous to primitive human joy; these calls have been termed "[[Laughter in animals|laughter]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panksepp|first1=J|last2=Burgdorf|first2=J|year=2003|title="Laughing" rats and the evolutionary antecedents of human joy?|journal=Physiology and Behavior|volume=79|issue=3|pages=533–547|doi=10.1016/s0031-9384(03)00159-8|pmid=12954448|citeseerx=10.1.1.326.9267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knutson|first1=B|last2=Burgdorf|first2=J|last3=Panksepp|first3=J|year=2002|title=Ultrasonic vocalizations as indices of affective states in rats|journal=Psychological Bulletin| volume=128|issue=6|pages=961–977|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.6.961|pmid=12405139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 50&amp;nbsp;kHz USVs in rats are uniquely elevated by [[hedonism|hedonic]] stimuli—such as [[tickling]], rewarding electrical brain stimulation, [[amphetamine]] injections, mating, play, and aggression—and are suppressed by aversive stimuli.&lt;ref name="Rygula" /&gt;  Of all manipulations that elicit 50&amp;nbsp;kHz chirps in rats, tickling by humans elicits the highest rate of these calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panksepp|first1=J|last2=Burgdorf|first2=J|year=2000|title=50-kHz chirping (laughter?) in response to conditioned and unconditioned tickle-induced reward in rats: effects of social housing and genetic variables|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=115|issue=1|pages=25–38|doi=10.1016/s0166-4328(00)00238-2|pmid=10996405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some vocalizations of domestic cats, such as purring, are well-known to be produced in situations of positive valence, such as mother kitten interactions, contacts with familiar partner, or during tactile stimulation with inanimate objects as when rolling and rubbing. Therefore, purring can be generally considered as an indicator of "pleasure" in cats.&lt;ref name="Boissy"&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.|last=Boissy|title=Assessment of positive emotions in animals to improve their welfare|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=92|issue=3|year=2007|pages=375–397|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2007.02.003|pmid=17428510|author2=and others|displayauthors=1|last3=Jensen|first3=Margit Bak|last4=Moe|first4=Randi Oppermann|last5=Spruijt|first5=Berry|last6=Keeling|first6=Linda J.|last7=Winckler|first7=Christoph|last8=Forkman|first8=Björn|last9=Dimitrov|first9=Ivan|last10=Langbein|first10=Jan|last11=Bakken|first11=Morten|last12=Veissier|first12=Isabelle|last13=Aubert|first13=Arnaud}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low pitched bleating in sheep has been associated with some positive-valence situations, as they are produced by males as an estrus female is approaching or by lactating mothers while licking and nursing their lambs.&lt;ref name="Boissy" /&gt;

==Criticism==
The argument that animals experience emotions is sometimes rejected due to a lack of evidence, and those who don't believe in the idea of animal intelligence, often argue that [[anthropomorphism]] plays a role in individuals' perspectives. Those who reject that animals have the capacity to experience emotion do so mainly by referring to inconsistencies in studies that have endorsed the belief emotions exist. Having no linguistic means to communicate emotion beyond behavioral response interpretation, the difficulty of providing an account of emotion in animals relies heavily on interpretive experimentation, that relies on results from human subjects.&lt;ref name="Paul2005" /&gt;

Some people oppose the concept of animal emotions and suggest that emotions aren't universal, including in humans. If emotions are not universal, this indicates that there is not a phylogenetic relationship between human and non-human emotion. The relationship drawn by proponents of animal emotion, then, would be merely a suggestion of mechanistic features that promote adaptivity, but lack the complexity of human emotional constructs. Thus, a social life-style may play a role in the process of basic emotions developing into more complex emotions.

Darwin concluded, through a survey, that humans share universal emotive expressions and suggested that animals likely share in these to some degree. Social constructionists disregard the concept that emotions are universal. Others hold an intermediate stance, suggesting that basic emotional expressions and emotion are universal but the intricacies are developed culturally. A study by Elfenbein and Ambady indicated that individuals within a particular culture are better at recognising other cultural members' emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elfenbein|first1=H.A.|last2=Ambady|first2=N.|year=2002|title=On the universality and cultural specificity of emotion recognition: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=128|issue=2|pages=203–235|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.203|pmid=11931516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primates===
{{Further|Primate cognition}}
Primates, in particular [[great apes]], are candidates for being able to experience [[empathy]] and [[theory of mind]]. Great apes have complex social systems; young apes and their mothers have strong bonds of attachment and when a baby chimpanzee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/science/17chimp.html?pagewanted=print|first=J.N.|last=Winford|title=Almost human, and sometimes smarter|publisher=New York Times|year=2007|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or gorilla&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26316788/|title=Mama gorilla won't let go of her dead baby|publisher=Associated Press|year=2008|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  dies, the mother will not uncommonly carry the body around for several days.

Beyond such anecdotal evidence, support for empathetic reactions has come from experimental studies of [[rhesus macaques]]. Macaques refused to pull a chain that delivered food to themselves if doing so also caused a companion to receive an electric shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wechkin | first1 = S. | last2 = Masserman | first2 = J.H. | last3 = Terris | first3 = W. | year = 1964 | title = Shock to a conspecific as an aversive stimulus | url = | journal = Psychonomic Science | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 47–48 | doi=10.3758/bf03342783}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masserman | first1 = J. | last2 = Wechkin | first2 = M.S. | last3 = Terris | first3 = W. | year = 1964 | title = Altruistic behavior in rhesus monkeys | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 121 | issue = 6| pages = 584–585 | pmid = 14239459 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.121.6.584 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.691.4969 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This inhibition of hurting another [[conspecific]] was more pronounced between familiar than unfamiliar macaques, a finding similar to that of [[empathy]] in humans.

Furthermore, there has been research on consolation behavior in chimpanzees. De Waal and Aureli found that third-party contacts attempt to relieve the distress of contact participants by consoling (e.g. making contact, embracing, grooming) recipients of [[aggression]], especially those that have experienced more intense aggression.&lt;ref&gt;De Waal, F.B.M. &amp; Aureli, F. (1996). Consolation, reconciliation, and a possible cognitive difference between macaques and chimpanzees. In A.E. Russon, K.A. Bard, and S.T. Parker (Eds.), ''Reaching Into Thought: The Minds Of The Great Apes'' (pp. 80-110). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers were unable to replicate these results using the same observation protocol in studies of monkeys, demonstrating a possible difference in empathy between monkeys and apes.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, D.P., Colmenares, F., &amp; Arnold, K.

Other studies have examined emotional processing in the great apes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parr | first1 = L.A. | year = 2001 | title = Cognitive and physiological markers of emotional awareness in chimpanzees | url = | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 4 | issue = 3–4| pages = 223–229 | doi=10.1007/s100710100085| pmid = 24777512 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, chimpanzees were shown video clips of emotionally charged scenes, such as a detested veterinary procedure or a favorite food, and then were required to match these scenes with one of two species-specific facial expressions: "happy" (a play-face) or "sad" (a teeth-baring expression seen in frustration or after defeat). The chimpanzees correctly matched the clips to the facial expressions that shared their meaning, demonstrating that they understand the emotional significance of their facial expressions. Measures of peripheral skin temperature also indicated that the video clips emotionally affected the chimpanzees.

===Rodents===
In 1998, [[Jaak Panksepp]] proposed that all mammalian species are equipped with brains capable of generating emotional experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Panksepp|first=J.|year=1998|title=Affective. Neuroscience: The Foundation of Human and Animal Emotions|publisher=Oxford University Press, New York|pages=480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent work examined studies on [[rodents]] to provide foundational support for this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panksepp|first1=J.B.|last2=Lahvis|first2=G.P.|year=2011|title=Rodent empathy and affective neuroscience|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=35|issue=9|pages=1864–1875|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2011.05.013|pmid=21672550|pmc=3183383}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these studies examined whether [[rat]]s would work to alleviate the distress of a conspecific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rice|first1=G.E.|last2=Gainer|first2=P|year=1962|title= Altruism in the albino rat|journal=Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology|volume=55|pages=123–125|doi=10.1037/h0042276|pmid=14491896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rats were trained to press a lever to avoid the delivery of an electric shock, signaled by a visual cue, to a conspecific. They were then tested in a situation in which either a conspecific or a Styrofoam block was hoisted into the air and could be lowered by pressing a lever. Rats that had previous experience with conspecific distress demonstrated greater than ten-fold more responses to lower a distressed conspecific compared to rats in the control group, while those who had never experienced conspecific distress expressed greater than three-fold more responses to lower a distressed conspecific relative to the control group. This suggests that rats will actively work to reduce the distress of a conspecific, a phenomenon related to empathy. Comparable results have also been found in similar experiments designed for monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mirsky|first1=I.A.|last2=Miller|first2=R.E.|last3=Murphy|first3=J.B.|year=1958|title=The communication of affect in rhesus monkeys I.

Langford et al. examined empathy in rodents using an approach based in [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langford|first1=D.J.|last2=Crager|first2=S.E.|last3=Shehzad|first3=Z.|last4=Smith|first4=S.B.|last5=Sotocinal|first5=S.G.|last6=Levenstadt|first6=J.S.|last7=Mogil|first7=J.S.|year=2006|title= Social modulation of pain as evidence for empathy in mice|journal=Science|volume=312|issue=5782|pages=1967–1970|doi=10.1126/science.1128322|pmid=16809545|url=http://digitool.Library.McGill.CA:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=145077|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reported that (1) if two [[mice]] experienced pain together, they expressed greater levels of pain-related behavior than if pain was experienced individually, (2) if experiencing different levels of pain together, the behavior of each mouse was modulated by the level of pain experienced by its social partner, and (3) sensitivity to a noxious stimulus was experienced to the same degree by the mouse observing a conspecific in pain as it was by the mouse directly experiencing the painful stimulus. The authors suggest this responsiveness to the pain of others demonstrated by mice is indicative of [[emotional contagion]], a phenomenon associated with empathy, which has also been reported in pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=I.|last1=Reimerta|first2=J.E|last2=Bolhuis|first3=B.|last3=Kemp|first4=T.B.|last4=Rodenburg.|title=Indicators of positive and negative emotions and emotional contagion in pigs|journal=Physiology and Behavior|volume=109|pages=42–50|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.11.002|pmid=23159725}}&lt;/ref&gt; One behaviour associated with fear in rats is freezing. If female rats experience electric shocks to the feet and then witness another rat experiencing similar footshocks, they freeze more than females without any experience of the shocks.  This suggests empathy in experienced rats witnessing another individual being shocked.  Furthermore, the demonstrator's behaviour was changed by the behaviour of the witness; demonstrators froze more following footshocks if their witness froze more creating an empathy loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=P.|last1=Atsak|first2=M|last2=Ore|first3=P.|last3=Bakker|first4=L.|last4=Cerliani|first5=B.|last5=Roozendaal|first6=V.|last6=Gazzola|first7=M.|last7=Moita|first8=C.|last8=Keysers|title=Experience modulates vicarious freezing in rats: a model for empathy|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=7|pages=e21855|year=2011|pmid=21765921|pmc=3135600|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have also shown rodents can respond to a [[conditioned stimulus]] that has been associated with the distress of a conspecific, as if it were paired with the direct experience of an [[unconditioned stimulus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kavaliers | first1 = M. | last2 = Colwell | first2 = D.D. | last3 = Choleris | first3 = E. | year = 2003 | title = Learning to fear and cope with a natural stressor: individually and socially acquired corticosterone and avoidance responses to biting flies | url = | journal = Hormones and Behavior | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 99–107 | doi=10.1016/s0018-506x(02)00021-1| pmid = 12614639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = E.J. | last2 = Kim | first2 = E.S. | last3 = Covey | first3 = E. | last4 = Kim | first4 = J.J. | year = 2010 | title = Social transmission of fear in rats: the role of 22-kHz ultrasonic distress vocalization | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 12| page = e15077 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0015077 | pmid=21152023 | pmc=2995742}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bruchey | first1 = A.K. | last2 = Jones | first2 = C.E. | last3 = Monfils | first3 = M.H. | year = 2010 | title = Fear conditioning by-proxy: social transmission of fear during memory retrieval | url = | journal = Behavioural Brain Research | volume = 214 | issue = 1| pages = 80–84 | doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2010.04.047| pmid = 20441779 | pmc = 2975564 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jeon | first1 = D. | last2 = Kim | first2 = S. | last3 = Chetana | first3 = M. | last4 = Jo | first4 = D. | last5 = Ruley | first5 = H.E. | last6 = Lin | first6 = S.Y. | last7 = Shin | first7 = H.S. | last8 = Kinet | first8 = Jean-Pierre | last9 = Shin | first9 = Hee-Sup | year = 2010 | title = Observational fear learning involves affective pain system and Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels in ACC | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 482–488 | doi=10.1038/nn.2504| pmid = 20190743 | pmc = 2958925  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = Q. | last2 = Panksepp | first2 = J.B. | last3 = Lahvis | first3 = G.P. | year = 2009 | title = Empathy is moderated by genetic background in mice | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 2| page = e4387 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004387 | pmid=19209221 | pmc=2633046}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies suggest that rodents are capable of shared [[affect (psychology)|affect]], a concept critical to empathy.

===Horses===
Although not direct evidence that horses experience emotions, a 2016 study showed that domestic horses react differently to seeing photographs of positive (happy) or negative (angry) human facial expressions.  When viewing angry faces, horses look more with their left eye which is associated with perceiving negative stimuli. Their heart rate also increases more quickly and they show more stress-related behaviours. One rider wrote, 'Experienced riders and trainers can learn to read the subtle moods of individual horses according to wisdom passed down from one horseman to the next, but also from years of trial-and-error. I suffered many bruised toes and nipped fingers before I could detect a curious swivel of the ears, irritated flick of the tail, or concerned crinkle above a long-lashed eye.' This suggests that horses have emotions and display them physically but it isn't concrete evidence.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, A.V., Proops, L., Grounds, K., Wathan, J. and McComb, K.|year=2016|title=Functionally relevant responses to human facial expressions of emotion in the domestic horse (Equus caballus)|journal=Biology Letters|volume=12|issue=2|pages=20150907|pmid=26864784|pmc=4780548|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2015.0907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birds===
[[Marc Bekoff]] reported accounts of animal behaviour which he believed was evidence of animals being able to experience emotions in his book ''The Emotional Lives of Animals''.&lt;ref name="Bekoff2007"&gt;{{cite book|page=1|author=Bekoff, Marc|title=The Emotional Lives of Animals|publisher=Novato, California: New World Library|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is an excerpt from his book:
{{Cquote|A few years ago my friend Rod and I were riding our bicycles around Boulder, Colorado, when we witnessed a very interesting encounter among five [[magpies]]. Magpies are corvids, a very intelligent family of birds. One magpie had obviously been hit by a car and was laying dead on the side of the road. The four other magpies were standing around him. One approached the corpse, gently pecked at it-just as an elephant noses the carcass of another elephant- and stepped back. Another magpie did the same thing. Next, one of the magpies flew off, brought back some grass, and laid it by the corpse. Another magpie did the same. Then, all four magpies stood vigil for a few seconds and one by one flew off.|&lt;ref&gt;(Pg. 1) Bekoff, Marc. ''The Emotional Lives of Animals''. Novato, California: New World Library, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[wikt:bystander|Bystander]] affiliation is believed to represent an expression of empathy in which the bystander tries to console a conflict victim and alleviate their distress. There is evidence for bystander affiliation in ravens (e.g. contact sitting, preening, or beak-to-beak or beak-to-body touching) and also for solicited bystander affiliation, in which there is post-conflict affiliation from the victim to the bystander. This indicates that ravens may be sensitive to the emotions of others, however, relationship value plays an important role in the prevalence and function of these post-conflict interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Orlaith | first1 = N.F. | last2 = Bugnyar | first2 = T. | year = 2010 | title = Do Ravens Show Consolation?

The capacity of domestic hens to experience [[Empathy in chickens|empathy]] has been studied.

===Dogs===
[[File:Lorenz emotions.png|right|thumb|250px|A drawing by [[Konrad Lorenz]] showing facial expressions of a dog]]
Some research indicates that domestic dogs may experience negative emotions in a similar manner to humans, including the equivalent of certain chronic and acute psychological conditions. Much of this is from studies by [[Martin Seligman]] on the theory of [[learned helplessness]] as an extension of his interest in depression:
{{blockquote|A dog that had earlier been repeatedly conditioned to associate an audible stimulus with inescapable electric shocks did not subsequently try to escape the electric shocks after the warning was presented, even though all the dog would have had to do is jump over a low divider within ten seconds. The dog didn't even try to avoid the "aversive stimulus"; it had previously "learned" that nothing it did would reduce the probability of it receiving a shock. A follow-up experiment involved three dogs affixed in harnesses, including one that received shocks of identical intensity and duration to the others, but the lever which would otherwise have allowed the dog a degree of control was left disconnected and didn't do anything. The first two dogs quickly recovered from the experience, but the third dog suffered chronic symptoms of [[clinical depression]] as a result of this perceived helplessness.}}

A further series of experiments showed that, similar to humans, under conditions of long-term intense psychological stress, around one third of dogs do not develop learned helplessness or long term depression.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M. E. (1972). Learned helplessness. ''Annual Review of Medicine,'' 207-412.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seligman | first1 = M. E. | last2 = Groves | first2 = D. P. | year = 1970 | title = Nontransient learned helplessness | url = | journal = Psychonomic Science | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 191–192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead these animals somehow managed to find a way to handle the unpleasant situation in spite of their past experience. The corresponding characteristic in humans has been found to correlate highly with an [[explanatory style]] and [[optimism|optimistic]] [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] that views the situation as ''other than'' personal, pervasive, or permanent.

Since these studies, symptoms analogous to clinical depression, [[neurosis]], and other psychological conditions have also been accepted as being within the scope of emotion in domestic dogs. The [[Body language of dogs|postures]] of dogs may indicate their emotional state.&lt;ref name = ahs&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/dogs/tips/avoid_dog_bites.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/ | access-date = April 28, 2017 | publisher = The Humane Society of the United States | date = 2017 | title = How to Avoid a Dog Bite -Be polite and pay attention to body language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sdhumane.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Dog-bite-prevention.pdf|title=Dog bite prevention &amp; canine body language|publisher=San Diego Humane Society|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, the recognition of specific postures and behaviors can be learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.petguide.com/blog/dog/new-bill-in-california-to-protect-dogs-in-police-altercations/|title=New Bill In California to Protect Dogs in Police Altercations - PetGuide|date=2017-02-22|work=PetGuide|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychology research has shown that when humans gaze at the face of another human, the gaze is not symmetrical; the gaze instinctively moves to the right side of the face to obtain information about their emotions and state.  Research at the [[University of Lincoln]] shows that dogs share this instinct when meeting a human, and only when meeting a human (i.e. not other animals or other dogs). They are the only non-primate species known to share this instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guo|first1=K.|last2=Hall|first2=C.|last3=Hall|first3=S.|last4=Meints|first4=K.|last5=Mills|first5=D.|year=2007|title=Left gaze bias in human infants, rhesus monkeys, and domestic dogs.|journal=Perception|volume=3|url=http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=v070385|accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alleyne|first=R.|title=Dogs can read emotion in human faces|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3354028/Dogs-can-read-emotion-in-human-faces.html|accessdate=2010-06-24|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=2008-10-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111060117/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3354028/Dogs-can-read-emotion-in-human-faces.html|archivedate=2011-01-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence and nature of personality traits in dogs have been studied (15,329 dogs of 164 different breeds). Five consistent and stable "narrow traits" were identified, described as playfulness, curiosity/fearlessness, chase-proneness, sociability and aggressiveness. A further higher order axis for shyness–boldness was also identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Svartberg|first1=K.|last2=Tapper|first2=I.|last3=Temrin|first3=H.|last4=Radesäter|first4=T.|last5=Thorman|first5=S.|year=2004|title=Consistency of personality traits in dogs|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=69|issue=2|pages=283–291|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.04.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Svartberga|first1=K.|last2=Forkman|first2=B.|year=2002|title=Personality traits in the domestic dog (Canis familiaris)|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=79|issue=2|pages=133–155|doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(02)00121-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogs presented with images of either human or dog faces with different emotional states (happy/playful or angry/aggressive) paired with a single vocalization (voices or barks) from the same individual with either a positive or negative emotional state or [[brown noise]].  Dogs look longer at the face whose expression is congruent to the emotional state of the vocalization, for both other dogs and humans.  This is an ability previously known only in humans.&lt;ref name="Albuquerque"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Albuquerque, N., Guo, K., Wilkinson, A., Savalli, C., Otta, E. and Mills, D.|year=2016|title=Dogs recognize dog and human emotions|journal=Biology Letters|volume=12|issue=1|pages=20150883|pmid=26763220|pmc=4785927|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2015.0883}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavior of a dog can not always be an indication its friendliness. This is because when a dog wags its tail, most people interpret this as the dog expressing happiness and friendliness. Though indeed tail wagging can express these positive emotions, tail wagging is also an indication of fear, insecurity, challenging of dominance, establishing social relationships or a warning that the dog may bite.&lt;ref name = wagging&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201112/what-wagging-dog-tail-really-means-new-scientific-data | first = Stanley | last = Coren | date = December 5, 2011 | access-date = April 30, 2017 | title =What a Wagging Dog Tail Really Means: New Scientific Data Specific tail wags provide information about the emotional state of dogs | publisher = Psychology Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers are beginning to investigate the question of whether dogs have emotions with the help of [[magnetic resonance imaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berns | first1 = G. S. | last2 = Brooks | first2 = A. M. | last3 = Spivak | first3 = M. | title = Functional MRI in Awake Unrestrained Dogs | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0038027 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = e38027 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22606363 | pmc =3350478 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cats===
It has been postulated that domestic cats can [[learning|learn]] to manipulate their owners through vocalizations that are similar to the cries of human babies.  Some cats learn to add a [[purr]] to the vocalization, which makes it less harmonious and more [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] to humans, and therefore harder to ignore. Individual cats learn to make these vocalizations through [[trial-and-error]]; when a particular vocalization elicits a positive response from a human, the probability increases that the cat will use that vocalization in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher= LiveScience.com |title=Cats do control humans, study finds |url=http://www.livescience.com/5556-cats-control-humans-study-finds.html|year=2009|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growling can be an expression of annoyance or fear, similar to humans.  When annoyed or angry, a cat wriggles and thumps its tail much more vigorously than when in a contented state.  In larger felids such as  [[lions]], what appears to be irritating to them varies between individuals. A male lion may let his cubs play with his mane or tail, or he may hiss and hit them with his paws.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lion#cite ref-105]]&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic male cats also have variable attitudes towards their family members, for example, older male siblings tend not to go near younger or new siblings and may even show hostility toward them.

===Honeybees===
[[File:Honeybee-27527-1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Honeybees become pessimistic after being shaken]]
Honeybees ("Apis mellifera carnica") were trained to extend their [[proboscis]] to a two-component odour mixture (CS+) predicting a reward (e.g., 1.00 or 2.00 M [[sucrose]]) and to withhold their proboscis from another mixture (CS−) predicting either punishment or a less valuable reward (e.g., 0.01 M [[quinine]] solution or 0.3 M sucrose).  Immediately after training, half of the honeybees were subjected to vigorous shaking for 60 s to simulate the state produced by a predatory attack on a concealed colony. This shaking reduced levels of [[octopamine (neurotransmitter)|octopamine]], [[dopamine]], and [[serotonin]] in the [[hemolymph]] of a separate group of honeybees at a time point corresponding to when the cognitive bias tests were performed. In honeybees, octopamine is the local [[neurotransmitter]] that functions during reward learning, whereas dopamine mediates the ability to learn to associate odours with quinine punishment.  If flies are fed serotonin, they are more aggressive; flies depleted of serotonin still exhibit aggression, but they do so much less frequently.

Within 5 minutes of the shaking, all the trained bees began a sequence of unreinforced test trials with five odour stimuli presented in a random order for each bee: the CS+, the CS−, and three novel odours composed of ratios intermediate between the two learned mixtures. Shaken honeybees were more likely to withhold their mouthparts from the CS− and from the most similar novel odour. Therefore, agitated honeybees display an increased expectation of bad outcomes similar to a vertebrate-like emotional state.  The researchers of the study stated that, "Although our results do not allow us to make any claims about the presence of negative subjective feelings in honeybees, they call into question how we identify emotions in any non-human animal. It is logically inconsistent to claim that the presence of pessimistic cognitive biases should be taken as confirmation that dogs or rats are anxious but to deny the same conclusion in the case of honeybees."&lt;ref name="Bateson"&gt;{{cite journal|

===Crayfish===

[[Crayfish]] naturally explore new environments but display a general preference for dark places.

Crayfish which experienced an electric shock displayed enhanced fearfulness or anxiety as demonstrated by their preference for the dark arms more than the light. Furthermore, shocked crayfish had relatively higher brain [[serotonin]] concentrations coupled with elevated blood glucose, which indicates a stress response.&lt;ref name="Sneddon2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sneddon, L.U.|year=2015|title=Pain in aquatic animals|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=218|issue=7|pages=967–976|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/7/967.full |doi=10.1242/jeb.088823|pmid=25833131}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the crayfish calmed down when they were injected with the [[benzodiazepine]] anxiolytic, [[chlordiazepoxide]], used to treat anxiety in humans, and they entered the dark as normal. The authors of the study concluded "...stress-induced avoidance behavior in crayfish exhibits striking homologies with vertebrate anxiety."

A follow-up study using the same species confirmed the anxiolytic effect of chlordiazepoxide, but moreover, the intensity of the anxiety-like behaviour was dependent on the intensity of the electric shock until reaching a plateau. Such a quantitative relationship between stress and anxiety is also a very common feature of human and vertebrate anxiety.&lt;ref name="Fossat2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fossat, P., Bacqué-Cazenave, J., De Deurwaerdère, P., Cattaert, D. and Delbecque, J.P.|year=2015|title=Serotonin, but not dopamine, controls the stress response and anxiety-like behavior in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=218|issue=17|pages=2745–2752|doi=10.1242/jeb.120550|pmid=26139659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3183">The '''Energetically Autonomous Tactical Robot''' (EATR) was a project by Robotic Technology Inc. (RTI) and Cyclone Power Technologies Inc. to develop a robotic vehicle that could forage for plant [[biomass]] to fuel itself, theoretically operating indefinitely. It was being developed as a concept as part of the [[DARPA]] military projects for the [[United States military]].&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,533382,00.html|title=Biomass-Eating Military Robot Is a Vegetarian, Company Says|date=2009-07-16|work=FOXNews.com|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project elicited some internet and media rumors after news circulated that the robot would (or at least could) ingest human remains.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2009/07/company-denies-its-robots-feed-on-the-dead/|title= Danger Room What’s Next in National Security Company Denies its Robots Feed on the Dead|last=Shachtman|first=Noah|date=2009-07-17|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclone Power Technologies stated that animal or human biomass was not intended to be used in the ''waste heat'' combustion engine of the [[robot]],&lt;ref&gt; Press release, RTI Inc. (2009 July 16). [http://www.robotictechnologyinc.com/images/upload/file/Cyclone%20Power%20Press%20Release%20EATR%20Rumors%20Final%2016%20July%2009.pdf "Press Release"], ''Cyclone Power Technologies Responds to Rumors about “Flesh Eating” Military Robot'', pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; and that sensors would be able to distinguish foraged materials,&lt;ref name="FOX" /&gt; although the project overview from RTI listed other sources including chicken fat.&lt;ref name="bpopp22" /&gt; 

==Power plant==
The robot was powered by a steam engine built by the Cyclone Power Technologies company called the [[Cyclone Waste Heat Engine]], which produced power through external combustion of biomass (i.e. combustion outside of the engine), an example of a [[Rankine cycle]] engine. The engine would power the vehicle's movement as well as being used to recharge the batteries that run the sensors, arms and ancillary devices.&lt;ref name="bpopp22"&gt; Press release, RTI Inc. (2009 April 6). [http://www.robotictechnologyinc.com/images/upload/file/Presentation%20EATR%20Brief%20Overview%206%20April%2009.pdf "Brief Project Overview"], ''EATR: ENERGETICALLY AUTONOMOUS TACTICAL ROBOT'', pp. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuel sources===
The EATR was programmed to consume certain types of vegetation as [[biomass]] to convert into fuel, and only those types of vegetation. EATR could also use other fuels such as gasoline, kerosene, cooking oil, or solar energy.

The company also included "chicken fat" as one of its proposed fuel sources in the project overview.&lt;ref name="bpopp22" /&gt;

The system was quoted as delivering an expected 100 miles (~161 km) of driving on 150 lbs (~68 kg) of vegetation.

'''Explorer 55''', also called as '''AE-E''' ('''Atmospheric Explorer E'''), was a [[NASA]] [[scientific]] [[satellite]] belonging to series '''Atmosphere Explorer''', being launched on November 20, 1975 from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral AFS]] board a [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta 2910]] rocket.

==Characteristics==
The purpose of the Explorer 55 mission was to investigate the chemical processes and energy transfer mechanisms that control the structure and behavior of the earth's atmosphere and [[ionosphere]] in the region of high absorption of solar energy at low and [[Equator|equatorial]] latitudes. The simultaneous sampling at higher [[latitude]]s was carried out by the Explorer 54 spacecraft until its failure on January 29, 1976, and then by Explorer 51, until it reentered on December 12, 1978. The same type of spacecraft as [[Explorer 51]] was used, and the payload consisted of the same types of instruments except that the low-energy [[electron]] and [[UV]] nitric oxide experiments were deleted and a backscatter UV [[spectrometer]] was added to monitor the [[ozone]] content of the atmosphere. 

The 2 experiments that were deleted were more appropriate for the high-latitude regions. The perigee swept through more than 6 full [[latitude]] cycles and two local time cycles during the first year after launch when the orbit was [[elliptical]] and the perigee height was varied between {{convert|130|km|mi}} and {{convert|400|km|mi}}. The circularization of the orbit around {{convert|390|km|mi}} was made on November 20, 1976 and the spacecraft was raised to this height whenever it would decay to about {{convert|250|km|mi}}. AE-E reentered on June 10, 1981.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6827">[[File:Bloomsbury Square1.jpg|thumb|[[Bloomsbury Square]], a garden square in central London, England.]]

A '''garden square''' is a type of [[communal garden]] in an urban area wholly or substantially surrounded by buildings and, commonly, continues to be applied to public and private parks formed after such a garden becomes accessible to the public at large. The archetypal garden square is surrounded by tall [[terraced houses]] and other types of [[townhouse]]. It is subtly distinguished from a public-access version throughout the existence of the square &amp;ndash; the [[town square]].  Due to its inherent private history it may have a pattern of dedicated [[footpath]]s and tends to have considerably more plants than hard surfaces and/or large monuments. 

==Propagation==
{{see also|Town square}}
At their conception in the early 17th century each such garden was a private [[commons|communal amenity]] for the residents of the overlooking houses akin to a garden [[courtyard]] within a palace or community. Such community courtyards date back to at least [[Ur]] in 2000 BC where two-storey houses were built of fired brick around an open square. [[Kitchen]], working, and public spaces were located on the ground floor, with private rooms located upstairs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YvpfndOKwGgC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false Tim McNeese (1999), ''History of Civilization - The Ancient World'', Lorenz Educational Press, p. 10] {{ISBN|9780787703875}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The conversion of many during the 20th century into public parks renders those garden squares a subset of town squares, that is those with a garden square heritage. Some remain private &amp;mdash; they may open intermittently or regularly &amp;mdash; but many today are open to the public at least during part of every day, serving as small parks.

==Occurrence==
===Europe===
{{expand section|date=March 2018}}
====United Kingdom====
London is famous for them; they are described as one of the glories of the capital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7881665/Court-denies-couple-use-of-garden-square.html "Court denies couple use of garden square"], Martin Evans, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 10 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Many were built or rebuilt during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, at the height of [[Georgian architecture]], and are surrounded by [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|elegant townhouses]]. Large projects, such as the [[Bedford Estate]], included garden squares in their development. The [[Notting Hill]] and [[Bloomsbury]] neighbourhoods both have many garden squares, with the former mostly still restricted to residents, and the latter open to all.  Other UK cities prominent in the Georgian era such as [[Edinburgh]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Bristol]] and [[Leeds]] have several garden squares.

Householders with access to a private garden square are commonly required to pay a maintenance levy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/councilanddemocracy/counciltax/gardensquarelevies.aspx Council tax and garden square levies], [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]], London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the charge is set annually by a garden committee. 

Sometimes private garden squares are opened to the public, such as during Open Garden Squares Weekend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensquares.org/ Open Garden Squares Weekend], London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
=====In Paris=====
Privately owned squares which survived the decades after the [[French Revolution]] and 19th century [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]] include the [[Place des Vosges]] and [[Square des Épinettes]] in Paris. It was a fashionable and expensive square to live in during the 17th and 18th centuries, and one of the central reasons that [[Le Marais]] district became so fashionable for French nobility.  It was inaugurated in 1612 with a grand ''[[carrousel]]'' to celebrate the engagement of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] to [[Anne of Austria]] and is a prototype of the residential squares of European cities that were to come. What was new about the ''Place Royale'' as it was known in 1612 was that the house fronts were all built to the same design, probably by [[Baptiste du Cerceau]].

In town squares, similarly green but publicly accessible from the outset, is the [[Square René Viviani]]. Gardens substantially cover a few of the famous ''Places'' in the capital; instead the majority are paved and replete with profoundly hard materials such as [[Place de la Concorde]].  Inspired by ecological interests and a 21st century focus on pollution mitigation, an increasing number of the Places in Paris today many have a focal tree, or surrounding raised flower beds/and or rows of trees such as the [[Place de la République]].  

The enclosed garden terraces (''French: jardins en terrain'') and courtyards (''French: cours'') of some [[List_of_palaces#France|French former palaces]] have resulted in redevelopments into spaces equivalent to garden squares.  The same former single-owner scenario applies to at least one garden square in London ([[Squares_in_London#West_and_southwest|Coleridge Square]]).

=====Outside of Paris=====
Grandiose instances of garden-use town squares are a part of many French cities, others opt for solid material town squares.  

===Belgium===
The Square de Meeûs and Square Orban are notable examples in Brussels. 

===Ireland===
Dublin has several Georgian examples, including [[Merrion Square]].

===The Americas===
{{expand section|date=March 2018}}
====United States====
[[Rittenhouse Square]] in the [[Center City, Philadelphia]] encases a public garden, one of the five original open-space parks planned by William Penn and his surveyor Thomas Holme during the late 17th century. It was first named Southwest Square.

Nearby [[Fitler Square]] is a similar garden square named for late 19th century Philadelphia mayor Edwin Henry Fitler shortly after his death in 1896. The Square, cared for through a public private partnership between the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Fitler Square Improvement Association.

In [[Boston]] tens of squares exist, some having a mainly residential use.

'''Genopolitics''' is the study of the genetic basis of political behavior and attitudes. It combines [[behavior genetics]], [[psychology]], and [[political science]] and it is closely related to the emerging fields of [[neuropolitics]] (the study of the neural basis of political behavior and attitudes) and political physiology (the study of biophysical correlates of political attitudes and behavior).

In 2008, ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' reported on the increase in academicians' recognition of and engagement in genopolitics as a discrete field of study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Monastersky |first=Richard |date=September 19, 2008 |work=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] |title=The Body Politic: Biology May Shape Political Views |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Biology-May-Shape-Political/1173}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' included genopolitics in its "Eighth Annual Year in Ideas" for the same year, noting that the term was originally coined by [[James H. Fowler|James Fowler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/magazine/14Ideas-Section2-B-t-007.html |last=Biuso |first=Emily |title=Genopolitics |newspaper=New York Times Magazine |date=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of genopolitics have argued that it is "a fundamentally misguided undertaking", and that it is inconsistent with evidence in the fields of [[genetics]], [[neuroscience]], and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Charney |first=Evan |last2=English |first2=William |date=May 2013 |title=Genopolitics and the Science of Genetics |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/genopolitics-and-the-science-of-genetics/3743ED789015701CDD2F256F78A91B85 |journal=American Political Science Review |language=en |volume=107 |issue=2 |pages=382–395 |doi=10.1017/S0003055413000099 |issn=0003-0554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twin studies of political attitudes==
Psychologists and behavior geneticists began using twin studies in the 1980s to study variation in social attitudes, and these studies suggested that both genes and environment played a role. In particular, [[Nick Martin (scientist)|Nick Martin]] and his colleagues published an influential [[twin study]] of social attitudes in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' in 1986.

However, this early work did not specifically analyze whether or not political orientations were heritable, and political scientists remained mostly unaware of the heritability of social attitudes until 2005.  In that year, the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' published a reanalysis of political questions on Martin's social attitude survey of twins in that the suggested liberal and conservative ideology is heritable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=307695 |title=Are Political Orientations Genetically Transmitted? |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=99 |pages=153–167 |year=2005 |last=Alford |first=John |author2=Carolyn Funk |author3=John Hibbing  |format=PDF |issue=2 |doi=10.1017/s0003055405051579}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article sparked considerable debate between critics, the authors and their defenders.&lt;ref name=Charney08-1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Charney|first=Evan|title=Genes and Ideologies|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=June 2008|volume=6|issue=2|pages=299–319|doi=10.1017/S1537592708080626|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFH08-1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alford|first=John R.|author2=Funk, Carolyn L. |author3=Hibbing, John R. |title=Beyond Liberals and Conservatives to Political Genotypes and Phenotypes|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=June 2008|volume=6|issue=2|pages=321–328|doi=10.1017/S1537592708080638|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1030&amp;context=poliscifacpub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hannagan08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hannagan|first=Rebecca J.|author2=Hatemi, Peter K.|title=The Threat of Genes: A Comment on Evan Charney's "Genes and Ideologies"|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=June 2008|volume=6|issue=2|pages=329–335|doi=10.1017/S153759270808064X|url=http://ussc.edu.au/ussc/assets/media/docs/publications/04_Hannagan_Hatemi_PoP_2008.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charney08-2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Charney |first=Evan |date=June 2008 |title=Politics, Genetics, and "Greedy Reductionism" |url=http://www.sanford.duke.edu/research/papers/Perpectives-GeneticsJune2008.pdf#page=37 |journal=Perspectives on Politics |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=337–343 |doi=10.1017/S1537592708080651 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308002322/http://www.sanford.duke.edu/research/papers/Perpectives-GeneticsJune2008.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beckwith08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beckwith|first=Jon|author2=Morris, Corey A.|title=Twin Studies of Political Behavior: Untenable Assumptions?|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=December 2008|volume=6|issue=4|pages=785–791|doi=10.1017/S1537592708081917|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/morris-singer/files/perspectives_on_politics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFH08-2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alford|first=John R.|author2=Funk, Carolyn L. |author3=Hibbing, John R. |title=Twin Studies, Molecular Genetics, Politics, and Tolerance: A Response to Beckwith and Morris|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=December 2008|volume=6|issue=4|pages=793–797|doi=10.1017/S1537592708081929|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=poliscifacpub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twin studies of political behavior==
Initial twin studies suggested that predispositions toward espousal of certain political ideas are heritable, but they said little about political behavior (patterns of voting and/or activism) or predispositions toward it. A 2008 article published in the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' matched publicly available voter registration records to a [[twin registry]] in Los Angeles, analyzed self-reported [[voter turnout]] in the [[National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health]] (Add Health), and studied other forms of [[political participation]]. In all three cases, both genes and environment contributed significantly to variation in political behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genetic Variation in Political Participation |last=Fowler |first=James H. |author2=Laura A. Baker |author3=Christopher T. Dawes  |journal=American Political Science Review |url=http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/genetic_basis_of_political_cooperation.pdf |issue=2 |volume=102 |pages=233–248 |date=May 2008 |doi=10.1017/S0003055408080209 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional studies showed that genes did not play a direct role in the choice of a political party, supporting a core finding in the study of American politics that the choice to be a Democrat or a Republican is largely shaped by parental socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Genetics of Voting: An Australian Twin Study |journal=Behavior Genetics |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=435–448 |year=2007 |last=Hatemi |first=Peter K. |pmid=17221311 |author2=Sarah E.

Dawes |author3=James H. Fowler  |url=http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/heritability_of_partisan_attachment.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gene association studies==

===Candidate genes===
Scholars therefore recently turned their attention to specific genes that might be associated with political behaviors and attitudes. In the first-ever research to link specific genes to political phenotypes, a direct association was established between voter turnout and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and a gene–environment interaction between turnout and the serotonin transporter (5HTT) gene among those who frequently participated in religious activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Two Genes Predict Voter Turnout |last=Fowler |first=James H. |author2=Christopher T. Dawes |journal=Journal of Politics |date=July 2008 |url= http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/two_genes_predict_voter_turnout.pdf |issue=3 |volume=70 |pages=579–594 |format=PDF |doi=10.1017/S0022381608080638}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other research scholars have also found an association between voter turnout and a dopamine receptor (DRD2) gene that is mediated by a significant association between that gene and the tendency to affiliate with a political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Partisanship, Voting, and the Dopamine D2 Receptor Gene |last=Dawes |first=Christopher T. |author2=James H. Fowler |url=http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/partisanship_voting_and_drd2.pdf | doi = 10.1017/S002238160909094X |year=2008 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=Please state specific conclusion of study, i.e., relationship between specific gene variant and specific ideology.|date=November 2015}} More recent studies show an interaction between friendships and the dopamine receptor (DRD4) gene that is associated with political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Friendships Moderate an Association Between a Dopamine Gene Variant and Political Ideology |last=Settle |first=Jaime E. |author2=Christopher T. Dawes |author3=Peter K. Hatemi |author4=Nicholas A. Christakis |author5=James H. Fowler  |url=http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/friends_drd4_and_political_ideology.pdf |year=2008 |format=PDF}}{{clarify|reason=Please state specific conclusion of study, i.e., relationship between specific gene variant and specific ideology.|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this work is preliminary and needs replication, it suggests that neurotransmitter function has an important effect on political behavior.

The candidate genes approach to genopolitics received substantial criticism in a 2012 article, published in the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'', which argued that many of the candidate genes identified in the above research are associated with innumerable traits and behaviors. The degree to which these genes are associated with so many outcomes thus undermines the apparent important of evidence linking a gene to any particular outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Charney, Evan, and English, William. (2012). Candidate Genes and Political Behavior. American Political Science Review 106(1):1-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linkage analysis===
Employing a more general approach, researchers used genome-wide [[Genetic linkage|linkage]] analysis to identify chromosomal regions associated with political attitudes assessed using scores on a liberalism-conservativism scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genome-Wide Analysis of Liberal and Conservative Political Attitudes|last=Hatemi|first=P. K.|journal=The Journal of Politics|issue=1|volume=73|pages=271–285|url=http://www.vipbg.vcu.edu/~nathan/publications/Hatemi2011.pdf|date=January 2011|doi=10.1017/S0022381610001015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their analysis identified several significant linkage peaks and the associated chromosomal regions implicate a possible role for NMDA and glutamate related receptors in forming political attitudes. However, this role is speculative as linkage analysis cannot identify the effect of individual genes.

===Other explanations===
Associations between genetic markers and political behavior are often assumed to predict a causal connection between the two. Scholars have little incentive to be skeptical of this presumed causal link. Yet it is possible that a confounding factor exists which makes the genetic relationship with politics purely correlative. For instance work on Irish parties, which shows some evidence of a genetic basis for the otherwise inexplicable distinction between the historically two main parties there, is also and more easily explained by socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byrne|first1=Kevin P.|title=Politics with Hidden Bases: Unearthing the Deep Roots of Party Systems|journal=BJPIR|date=2012|volume=14|pages=613–629|doi=10.1111/j.1467-856X.2011.00478.x|url=http://www.kevinbyrne.org/pubs/ByrneOMalley2012.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3292">'''George Merryweather''' was a doctor and inventor born on 10 April 1794 in [[Burley in Wharfedale]], [[Yorkshire]], [[England]]. He married Jane Anderson Loy in 1826. They had four children: Mary, Jane, John and Emily. He then married Hannah Baker in 1844, after the death of his first wife in 1832. Merryweather died on 4 November 1870 in [[Whitby]], [[Yorkshire]], [[England]]. He was interred in Whitby's Larpool Cemetery. Despite this, he was seen in 1871 at 10 Abbey Terrace West, although his death was officially registered a year before.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Inventions==
In 1832 George wrote his first essay "The means of maintaining uniform temperature and supporting fire without the agency of wood or coal". He invented the so-called "Platina Lamp", which was described to "keep burning for a fortnight on an economical mixture of pure [[alcohol]] and [[whisky]], at a cost of one penny for eight hours".

But his most remarkable invention was the "[[Tempest Prognosticator]]"&amp;mdash;a weather predicting device also called "The Leech Barometer".&lt;ref&gt;Katharine Anderson. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8GPl59EFk4IC&amp;pg=PA172 ''Predicting the Weather: Victorians and the Science of Meteorology.''] [[University of Chicago Press]], 2005.
{{ISBN|978-0-226-01968-0}}; pp. 172&amp;ndash;174&lt;/ref&gt; It had great success and caused a sensation when it was put on show at the [[Great Exhibition]], so in 1850-1 Merryweather wrote "An essay explanatory of the tempest prognosticator in the Great Exhibition 1851".  At this time he was an honorary curator of [[Whitby Philosophical Society]].
After the success of the "[[Tempest Prognosticator]]" at the Great Exhibition, Merryweather tried to persuade the British government to install his device at ports around the British coast. However, the government reacted coolly to the proposal and the Meteorological Department insisted on using barometers and weather charts instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/weather/article4029935.ece ''Slimy creatures start climbing as storms brew.''] [[The Times]], May 30, 2008. Accessed December 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern science considers Merryweather's methods underlying the "[[Tempest Prognosticator]]"  to be unproven.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Michalsen, Manfred Roth and Gustav Dobos. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BXWqJTsE-GIC&amp;pg=PA40 ''Medicinal Leech Therapy.''] Thieme Medical Publishers, 2007.
{{ISBN|978-1-58890-563-5}}; p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Merryweather referred to the leeches as his "jury of philosophical councilors" and explains that the twelve bottles were placed in a circle in order that his "little comrades" might see one another and "not endure the affliction of solitary confinement".

==Career as a doctor of medicine==
In 1835 Merryweather finished studying in MD [[University of Edinburgh]]. In 1840 he worked as a [[family doctor]] in [[Whitby]], and by 1849 he was a [[surgeon]].

{{One source|date=July 2011}}

'''Hotelling's law''' is an observation in [[economics]] that in many markets it is [[Rationality|rational]] for producers to make their products as similar as possible. This is also referred to as the '''principle of minimum differentiation''' as well as Hotelling's [[Location model|linear city model]]. The observation was made by [[Harold Hotelling]] (1895&amp;ndash;1973) in the article "Stability in Competition" in ''Economic Journal'' in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Harold |last=Hotelling |title=Stability in Competition |journal=Economic Journal |volume=39 |issue=153 |year=1929 |pages=41–57 |doi=10.2307/2224214|url=http://people.bath.ac.uk/ecsjgs/Teaching/Industrial%20Organisation/Papers/Hotelling%20-%20Stability%20in%20Competition.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposing phenomenon is [[product differentiation]], which is usually considered to be a business advantage if executed properly.

==Example==

[[Image:Mrzezyno2Apteki.jpg|thumb|240px|Two pharmacies on the main street in [[Mrzeżyno]]. Possibly an effect of Hotelling's location competition.]]

Suppose there are two competing shops located along the length of a street running north and south, with customers spread equally along the street. Each shop owner wants to locate his shop such that he maximises his own [[market share]] by drawing the largest number of customers. In this example, the shop itself is the 'product' considered and both products are equal in quality and price. There is no difference in product to the customers. Therefore, each customer will always choose the nearest shop because there is no difference in product or price.

===One shop===
For a single shop, the optimal location is anywhere along the length of the street. The shop owner is completely indifferent about the location of the shop since it will draw all customers to it, by default. However, from the point of view of a [[social welfare function]] that tries to minimize the distance that people need to walk, the optimal point is halfway along the length of the street.

===Two shops: halfway===
Hotelling's law predicts that a street with two shops will also find both shops right next to each other at the same halfway point. Each shop will serve half the market; one will draw customers from the north, the other all customers from the south.

Another example of the law in action or practice is to think of two food pushcarts at a beach. Assume one starts at the south end of the beach and one starts at the north. Again assuming a rational consumer and equal distribution along the beach, each cart will get 50% of the customers, divided along an invisible line equidistant from the carts. But, each cart owner will be tempted to push his cart slightly towards the other, in order to move the invisible line so that it encompasses more than 50% of the beach. Eventually, the pushcart operators end up next to each other in the center of the beach.

===Social optimum ===
Obviously, it would be more socially beneficial if the shops separated themselves and moved to one quarter of the way along the street from each end &amp;mdash; each would still draw half of the customers (the northern or southern half) and the customers would enjoy a shorter travel distance. However, neither shop would be willing to do this independently, as it would then allow the other shop to relocate and capture more than half the market.

===Deviating assumptions===
When not all people along the street, or along the range of possible different product positions, consume a minimum number of goods, companies can position their products to sections where consumers exist to maximize profit; this will often mean that companies will position themselves in different sections of the street, occupying niche markets. When prices are not fixed, companies can modify their prices to compete for customers; in those cases it is in the company's best interest to differentiate themselves as far away from each other as possible so they face less competition from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecm/emetrp/v47y1979i5p1145-50.html|title = On Hotelling's "Stability in Competition"|last = D'Aspremont|first = C.|date = 1979|journal = Econometrica|doi = 10.2307/1911955 |last2 = Gabszewicz|first2 = J. Jaskold|first3 = J.-F.|last3 = Thisse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
The street is a metaphor for product differentiation; in the specific case of a street, the stores differentiate themselves from each other by location. The example can be generalized to all other types of horizontal product differentiation in almost any product characteristic, such as sweetness, colour, or size. The above case where the two stores are side by side would translate into products that are identical to each other. This phenomenon is present in many markets, particularly in those considered to be primarily [[commodities]], and results in less variety for the consumer.

An extension of the principle into other environments of [[rational choice]] such as election "markets" can explain the common complaint that, for instance, the presidential candidates of the two [[American political parties]] are "practically the same".  Once each candidate is confirmed during [[primaries]], they are usually established within their own partisan camps.  The remaining undecided electorate resides in the middle of the [[political spectrum]], and there is a tendency for the candidates to "rush for the middle" in order to appeal to this crucial bloc.  Like the paradigmatic example, the assumption is that people will choose the least distant option, (in this case, the distance is [[ideology|ideological]]) and that the most votes can be had by being directly in the center.

==In real life==
This phenomenon can be observed in real life, not just in commodity businesses like bars, restaurants, and gas stations, but even in large, branded chains:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetizen.com/node/65765 Why Do Certain Retail Stores Cluster Together?]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''John Browne''' (1642–1702) was an English anatomist, surgeon and author. He published the first description of [[cirrhosis of the liver]] in 1685 and the first description of [[necrotising pancreatitis]] in 1684. He was also known for [[Scientific misconduct|publishing the work of others under his name]].

==Life==
Browne was brought up in [[Norwich]], in a surgical family, being related to William Crop, a surgeon in [[Norfolk]], but not closely related to [[Sir Thomas Browne]] whom he knew. He studied at [[St. Thomas's Hospital, London]], under Thomas Hollyer, served as a naval surgeon, and then practised in Norwich.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB
  | wstitle = Browne, John (1642-1700?)
  | volume  = 7
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1678 Browne moved to London, and about the same time was made surgeon [[in ordinary]] to King Charles II. With the king's recommendation he became surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital, on 21 June 1683, chosen over Edward Rice who had taken charge of the hospital during the [[Great Plague]] of 1665, when other surgeons deserted their posts.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1691 complaints arose that the surgeons did not obey the regulations of the hospital, and claimed that being appointed by royal mandamus they were not responsible to the governors. The Whig [[Robert Clayton (Lord Mayor)|Sir Robert Clayton]] was then President, the governors were determined to maintain their authority, and on 7 July 1691 they dismissed the whole of their surgical staff, including Browne, and appointed others. Browne appealed to the lords commissioners of the great seal, and the governors were called upon to defend their proceedings.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Browne was also surgeon to William III. In 1698 he petitioned the governors to be reinstated, though without success.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Browne wrote:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

*''A Treatise of Preternatural Tumours'', London, 1678 (with plates).
*''A Complete Discourse of Wounds'', London, 1678 (with plates).
*''Adeno-Choiradelogia, or an Anatomick-Chirurgical Treatise'', London, 1684, in three parts:

#''Adenographia, or an Anatomical Treatise of the Glandules''; 
#''Chreradelogia, or an exact Discourse of Strumaes or King's Evil Swellings'';
#''Charisma Basilicon, or the Royal Gift of Healing Strumaes, &amp;c., by Contact or Imposition of the Sacred Hands of our Kings of England and of France''. It describes the method pursued by Charles II in touching for the "[[king's evil]]", with which as the king's surgeon Browne was officially concerned. It gives statistics for the numbers of persons touched (between 1660 and 1682, reckoned as 92,107).
*''Myographia Nova, or a graphical description of all the Muscles in the Human Body; with one and forty copper-plates'', London, 1684; 2nd ed. Lugd. Batavorum, 1687; 3rd ed. London, 1697; 4th ed. London, 1698. This treatise on the muscles consists of six lectures, illustrated by copper-plates.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; It was, however, plagiarised, as was pointed out by [[James Yonge (surgeon)|James Yonge]]: it put together text from the ''Muskotomia'' of William Molins with illustrations from the ''Tabula anatomicae'' of [[Giulio Casserius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37926">A '''Josephson voltage standard''' is a complex system that uses a superconductive integrated circuit chip operating at 4 K to generate stable voltages that depend only on an applied frequency and fundamental constants.  It is an intrinsic standard in the sense that it does not depend on any physical artifact.  It is the most accurate method to generate or measure voltage and, by international agreement in 1990, is the basis for voltage standards around the world.

== The  Josephson effect==
In 1962, [[Brian Josephson]], a graduate student at Cambridge University, derived equations for the current and voltage across a junction consisting of a thin insulating barrier separating two [[superconductors]] – now generally known as a [[Josephson junction]].&lt;ref&gt;B.D. Josephson, Phys. Lett., 1, 251 (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;  His equations predicted that if a junction is driven at frequency &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;, then its current-voltage (I-V) curve will develop regions of constant voltage at the values &lt;math&gt; nhf/2e &lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is an integer and  &lt;math&gt; h/e  &lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of the Planck constant  &lt;math&gt;h &lt;/math&gt; to the elementary charge  &lt;math&gt;e &lt;/math&gt;.  This prediction was verified experimentally by Shapiro &lt;ref&gt;S. Shapiro, Phys. Rev. Lett. 11 80 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; in 1963 and has become known as the AC Josephson effect. This effect found immediate application in [[metrology]] because it relates the volt to the second through a proportionality involving only fundamental constants.  Initially, this led to an improved value of the ratio  &lt;math&gt; h/e &lt;/math&gt;.  Today it is the basis for all primary [[voltage standard]]s. Josephson's [[Josephson effect|equation]] for the supercurrent through a superconductive tunnel junction is given by

:&lt;math&gt; I = I_c \sin \Bigl({4 \pi e \over h} \int V dt \Bigr) &lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; is the junction current, &lt;math&gt; I_c &lt;/math&gt; is the critical current, &lt;math&gt; V  &lt;/math&gt; is the junction voltage. &lt;math&gt; I_c  &lt;/math&gt;  is a function of the junction geometry, the temperature, and any residual magnetic field inside the magnetic shields that are used with voltage standard devices.  When a dc voltage is applied across the junction, Eq. (1) shows that the current will oscillate at a frequency &lt;math&gt; f_J=2eV/h &lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt; 2e/h &lt;/math&gt; is approximately equal to 484 GHz/mV.  The very high frequency and low level of this oscillation make it difficult to observe directly.  However, if an AC current at frequency &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is applied to the junction, the junction oscillation &lt;math&gt; f_J &lt;/math&gt; tends to phase lock to the applied frequency.  Under this phase lock, the average voltage across the junction equals &lt;math&gt; hf/2e  &lt;/math&gt;.  This effect, known as the AC [[Josephson effect]], is observed as a constant voltage step at &lt;math&gt; V = hf/2e &lt;/math&gt; in the voltage-current (I-V) curve of the junction.  It is also possible for the junction to phase lock to harmonics of &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;.  This results in a series of steps at voltages &lt;math&gt; V = nhf/2e &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is an integer, as shown in Fig. 1a.

[[File:JJ Steps low and high capacitance.jpg|thumb|right|Fig. 1 Constant voltage steps in the I-V curve of a junction driven with microwave radiation for (a) a low capacitance junction and (b) a high capacitance junction.]]

The [[Josephson effect]] was initially used to improve the measurement of the constant &lt;math&gt; 2e/h &lt;/math&gt; based on voltage values derived from the SI volt realization as maintained by [[Weston cell]]s. The uncertainty of these measurements was limited by the uncertainty of the SI volt realization and the stability of the Weston cells.&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Parker, D.N. Langenberg, A. Denenstein and B.N. Taylor, Phys. Rev. 177 639 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.F. Finnegan, A. Denenstein and D.N. Langenberg, Phys. Rev. B 4 1487 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;  The stability of the Josephson volt depends only on the stability of &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; (which can easily be a part in 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;), and is at least four orders of magnitude better than the stability of Weston cells.  Thus, in the early 1970s, many national standards laboratories adopted a value for the Josephson constant &lt;math&gt; K_J = 2e/h &lt;/math&gt; and began using the AC Josephson effect as the practical standard of voltage.&lt;ref&gt;B.N. Taylor, W.H. Parker, D.N. Langenberg, and A. Denenstein, Metrologia 3 89 (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.F. Field, T.F. Finnegan and J. Toots, Metrologia 9 155 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;  Owing to small differences in existing national standards, different values of &lt;math&gt; K_J &lt;/math&gt; were adopted by various countries.  This inconsistency was corrected in 1990 when, by international agreement, the constant &lt;math&gt; K_\text{J-90} &lt;/math&gt; was assigned the value 483597.9&amp;nbsp;GHz/V and adopted by all standards laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;T.J. Quinn, Metrologia 26 69 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The assigned value is based on a weighted average of volt realization measurements made prior to 1990 at many national measurement institutions.  The uncertainty in &lt;math&gt; K_\text{J-90} &lt;/math&gt; is 0.4 ppm.  Standards such as the Josephson volt that depend on fundamental constants rather than physical artifacts are known as intrinsic standards.  Although the Josephson voltage standard (JVS) does not realize the SI definition of the volt, it provides a very stable reference voltage that can be reproduced anywhere without the need to transfer artifacts such as Weston cells. The accuracy of the Josephson voltage-frequency relation &lt;math&gt; V = nf/K_J &lt;/math&gt;, and its independence from experimental conditions, such as bias current, temperature, and junction materials, have been subjected to many tests.&lt;ref&gt;J. Clarke, Phys. Rev. Lett. 21 1566 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. D. Bracken, and W.O. Hamilton, Phys. Rev. B 6 2603 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. K. Harvey, J.C. MacFarlane, and R.B. Frenkel, Metrologia 8 114 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Bloch, Phys. Rev. Lett. 21 1241 (1968), Phys. Rev. B, 2 109 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Rieger, D. J. Scalapino, and J. E. Mercereau, Phys. Rev. Lett. 27 1787 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Fulton, Phys. Rev. B, 7 981 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Niemeyer, L. Grimm, C.A. Hamilton, and R. L.

Kramer (Weinheim: VCH) 249 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; No significant deviation from this relation has ever been found.  In the most precise of these experiments, two Josephson devices are driven by the same frequency source, biased on the same step, and connected in a series opposition loop across a small  inductor.  Since this loop is entirely superconductive, any voltage difference leads to a changing magnetic field in the inductor.  This field is detected with a SQUID magnetometer and its constancy has set an upper limit on the voltage difference of less than 3 parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;J-S Tsai, A. K.

Bernd Seeber, (Inst. Of Physics Publishing, Philadelphia),  2 p. 1813 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The two major improvements coincide with the introduction of single-junction Josephson standards in the early 1970s and the introduction of series-array Josephson standards beginning in 1984.

== Early Josephson standards ==

Although the ac Josephson effect provides a much more stable voltage reference than Weston cells, the first single-junction Josephson standards  &lt;ref&gt;F. K. Harris, F. K. Fowler, and P. T. Olsen, Metrologia, 6 134 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.N. Taylor, Low Temperature Physics, LT-13 4,465, (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Eicke, T.F. Finnegan, and J. Toots, Metrologia, 9, 155-156, (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.F.Dziuba, B.F. Field, and T.F. Finnegan, IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas. 23 264 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.F. Field and V.W. Hesterman, IEEE Trans Instrum Meas., 25 509 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.F. Finnegan, J. Wilson, and J. Toots, IEEE Trans. Magn., 11 821 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.F. Finnegan, L.B. Holdeman, and S. Wahlsten, IEEE Trans. Magn. 13 392 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;
were difficult to use because they generated very small voltages (1-10 mV).  Several attempts were made to raise the voltage by connecting two or more junctions in series.  The most ambitious of these&lt;ref&gt;T. Endo, M. Hoyanagi and A. Nakamura; IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas., 32 267 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;
used 20 junctions in series to realize a voltage of 100 mV with an uncertainty of a few parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;.  Ensuring that every junction was on a constant voltage step required individually adjusting the bias current to each of the 20 junctions.  The difficulty of this procedure makes arrays of significantly more than 20 junctions impractical.

In 1977, Levinson et al.&lt;ref&gt;M.T. Levinson, R.Y. Chiao, M.J. Feldman and B.A. Tucker, Appl. Phys. Lett., 32 776 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;
made a suggestion that would ultimately lead to a solution to the multiple-bias problem.  Levinson pointed out the importance of the parameter &lt;math&gt; \beta_c = 4\pi eI_cR^2 C/h &lt;/math&gt; in determining the characteristics of rf-induced Josephson steps. &lt;math&gt;\beta_c &lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the damping of Josephson oscillations by the junction shunting resistance&lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt;.   In particular, he showed that junctions with a large capacitance &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; and a large &lt;math&gt; R (\beta_c &gt; 100) &lt;/math&gt; could generate an I-V curve with hysteretic constant-voltage steps like those shown in Fig. 1b.  These steps have become known as zero-crossing steps because they cross the zero-current axis of the I-V curve. The lack of stable regions between the first few steps means that for small dc bias currents, the junction voltage must be quantized.  With a common bias current at or near zero, the voltage across a large array of these junctions must also be quantized.  The possibility of obtaining constant-voltage steps at zero current over a wide range of junction and operating parameters suggested the possibility of building a voltage standard using large arrays of junctions.

After several preliminary experiments,&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Kautz, Appl. Phys. Lett., 36, 386 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Kautz and G. Costabile, IEEE Trans. Magn., 17 780 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Niemeyer, J.H. Hinken and W Meier, IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas. 33, 311 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;
a joint effort in 1984 between the National Bureau of Standards in the U. S. and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundes-Anstalt in Germany resolved the problems of junction stability and microwave distribution and created the first large Josephson array based on Levinson's idea.&lt;ref&gt;J. Niemeyer, J. H. Hinken and R. L. Kautz, Appl. Phys. Lett. 45 478 (1984); IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas., 34, 185 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;  Further design improvements and system development produced the first practical 1 V Josephson standards in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;C.A. Hamilton, R.L. Kautz, R.L. Steiner and F.L. Lloyd, IEEE Electron Device Lett., 6, 623 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[46] J. Niemeyer, L. Grimm, W. Meier, J.H. Hinken and E. Vollmer. Appl. Phys. Lett., 47, 1222 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;
Advances in superconductive integrated circuit technology, largely driven by the quest for a Josephson junction computer,&lt;ref&gt;IBM J. Res. and Dev. 24 105 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;
soon made possible much larger arrays. In 1987, the design was extended to a chip with 14484 junctions that generated about 150 000 quantized voltages spanning the range from -10 V to +10 V.&lt;ref&gt;F.L. Lloyd, C.A. Hamilton, J.A. Beall, D. Go, R.H. Ono and R.E. Harris,IEEE Electron Device Lett., 8, 449 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;
Numerous further refinements were made as 10 V Josephson standards were implemented in many national standards laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Hamilton, R. L. Kautz, F. L. Lloyd, R. L. Steiner, B. F. Fields, IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas. 36 258, (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.A. Hamilton, F.L. Lloyd, C. Kao and W.C. Goeke, IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas, 38, 314 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Steiner and B.F. Field, IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas. 38, 296 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Pöpel, J. Niemeyer, W Meier L Grimm, F.W. Dünschede, IEEE Trans. Instrum.

Potenziani, IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas. 46 256 (1997)
&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1989, all of the hardware and software for a complete voltage metrology system was commercially available.  Today, there are Josephson array voltage standards in more than 70 national, industrial, and military standards laboratories around the world.  A program of international comparisons carried out by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) has measured differences between a traveling Josephson standard and those of NMI’s that are typically less than 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;D.

==  Junction design details ==

[[File:JJ Structure with bias.jpg|thumb|400px|Fig. 3.  The structure of a superconductor-insulator-superconductor Josephson junction typically used in dc voltage standards.]]

Figure 3 illustrates the basic structure of one junction in a large series array.  The junction is an overlap between two superconductive thin films that are separated by a thin oxide barrier.  The junction sits above a ground plane and is separated from it by a few micrometers of insulation.  A dc current &lt;math&gt; I_{dc}&lt;/math&gt; and a microwave current &lt;math&gt;I_{ac}&lt;/math&gt; are driven through the junction.  The design parameters for the junction are its length &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt;, width &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt;, critical current density &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt; (critical current per unit area), and the microwave drive frequency &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;. The practical realization of an array voltage standard requires a thorough understanding of how these parameters affect the stability of the quantized voltage levels shown in Fig. 1b.  Stable operation requires that four conditions be satisfied:
# &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; must be small enough that the flux induced through the junction area by the microwave magnetic field is much less than the flux quantum &lt;math&gt; h/2e &lt;/math&gt;
# Both &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; must be small enough that the lowest resonant cavity mode of the junction is greater than &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;
# To avoid chaotic behavior, the junction plasma frequency &lt;math&gt; f_p &lt;/math&gt;, which is proportional to &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{J} &lt;/math&gt;, must be less than about one third &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;.
# The junction's critical current &lt;math&gt; I_c = WLJ &lt;/math&gt; should be as large as possible to prevent noise-induced quantum step transitions.
If any of these conditions is violated, the junction voltage is likely to switch randomly among several steps, making measurements impossible. A rigorous derivation of these conditions is the subject of several papers by Kautz.&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Kautz, J. Appl. Phys. 76 5538 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Kautz, Rev. Prog. Phys. 59 935 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:JJ 3D stability diagram.jpg|thumb|400px|Fig. 4  A three-dimensional visualization of the region of stable voltage operation as a function of L, W, and J.]]
Figure 4 illustrates the region of stable behavior in the three-dimensional space of &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt;.  The margin of stable operation, represented by the shaded volume in Fig. 4, increases with &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; and is ultimately set by a trade-off between stability and the economics of providing a very high frequency microwave source.

== Array design ==

The I-V curve shown in Fig. 1b shows steps covering the range from about -1 mV to +1 mV and is for a junction driven by a nearly optimum level of microwave current.  At lower microwave current the steps cover a smaller range of voltage and at higher microwave current the steps become smaller and begin to move off the zero current axis.  In a large array, every junction must generate a large zero crossing step and thus the microwave power must be adjusted to a value low enough to accommodate the one junction receiving the largest microwave drive. Thus, in order to obtain the largest voltage from the smallest number of junctions, an array  standard requires a circuit design that can deliver nearly uniform microwave power to many thousands of junctions, all of which are connected in series.  The solution to this problem is a simple extension of Fig. 3 to a series of junctions in a line over a ground plane as shown in Fig. 5a.  This results in a microwave stripline that can propagate microwave power with relatively low loss.
The capacitive impedance of the junctions is so small (approximately 1 m Ω ) relative to the strip line impedance (approx. 3 Ω) that each junction has a very minor effect on the propagation of microwave power in the strip line.  Typically, each junction will absorb about 0.02% to 0.04%  of the power propagating through it.  It is thus possible to connect several thousand junctions in series and still achieve a power uniformity of about  ±1.5&amp;nbsp;dB. With careful design, striplines with as many as 4800 junctions have been used.&lt;ref&gt;F. Müller, R. Pöpel, J. Kohlmann, J. Niemeyer, W. Meier, T. Weimann, L. Grimm, F. Dünschede, and P. Gutmann, IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas. 46 229 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Because 10 V Josephson standards require about 20 000 junctions, it is necessary to adopt a series/parallel circuit similar to that shown in Fig. 5b.&lt;sup&gt;[39]&lt;/sup&gt;  Here, a network of low- and high-pass filters allow the microwave power to be split into four parallel paths while maintaining a dc path in which all junctions are connected in series.

A typical integrated circuit layout for an array of 20 208 junctions is shown in Fig. 6.  The microwave drive power is collected from a waveguide by a finline antenna, split 16 ways, and injected into 16 junction strip lines of 1263 junctions each.  The junction striplines are separated from a superconductive ground plane by about 2 micrometers of  SiO2 dielectric. Symmetry in the splitting network ensures that the same power is delivered to each subarray. Several precautions are required to avoid reflections that would lead to standing waves and the consequent  nonuniform power distribution within the subarrays:  (1) Each stripline is terminated by a matched load that consists of several wavelengths of resistive strip line.  The use of resistive stripline rather than a discrete resistor guarantees a near perfect match over a wide range of fabrication parameters. (2) The dimensions of capacitors in the low- and high-pass filters are chosen to avoid resonances near the drive frequency.  (3)  The microwave bend radius has a minimum value of three times the stripline width.  Sharper bends result in unacceptable reflections.  In order to meet the bend requirement while still packing the array strips close together, "curly" bends that turn 215° and then back 45° are used.  (4) The junction spacing along the line must be close enough to avoid a resonance between adjacent junctions.&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Kautz, in Metrology at the Frontiers of Physics and Technology, ed. L. Grovini and T. J. Quinn (Amsterdam: North-Holland) 259  (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Microwave power is applied by inserting the finline end of the chip into a slot parallel to the E-field in a WR-12 waveguide.    The dc output appears across superconducting pads at the edge of the chip.

== Fabrication ==

Voltage standard chips are typically fabricated on silicon or glass substrates.  The integrated circuit has eight levels: (1) a 300&amp;nbsp;nm thick Nb ground plane, (2) a 2 μm layer of SiO2  that forms the microstripline dielectric, (3) a 200&amp;nbsp;nm Nb film that forms the lower electrode of the Josephson junctions, (4) a 3&amp;nbsp;nm metal oxide layer that forms the Josephson tunneling barrier, (5) a 100&amp;nbsp;nm Nb junction counter electrode (6) a 300&amp;nbsp;nm SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; film with windows for contacts to the counter electrode, (7) a 400&amp;nbsp;nm film of Nb that connects the junction counter electrodes, and (8) a 100&amp;nbsp;nm resistive film that forms the stripline terminations.

== Measurement systems ==
 
A block diagram of a modern Josephson voltage standard system is shown in Fig. 7.  The Josephson array chip is mounted inside a high-permeability magnetic shield at the end of a cryoprobe that makes the transition between a liquid helium Dewar and the room temperature environment. Some systems use a cryocooler to cool the chip and eliminate the need for liquid helium.  Three pairs of copper wires are connected to the array.  One pair supplies bias current, a second monitors the array voltage with an oscilloscope, and the third pair delivers the array voltage to the calibration system.  All of the wires pass through multiple levels of RFI filtering in a box at the top of the Dewar.  The box, the filters, and the Dewar itself form a shield that protects the Josephson array from electromagnetic interference that could cause step transitions.  Microwave power is delivered through a waveguide consisting of a 12&amp;nbsp;mm diameter tube with WR-12 launching horns on each end. Tubes of solid German silver or stainless steel plated internally with silver or gold are commonly used.  This waveguide simultaneously achieves low thermal loss (&lt;0.5 L liquid He per day) and low microwave loss (as low as 0.7&amp;nbsp;dB at 75&amp;nbsp;GHz).

[[File:Josephson_voltage_standard_block_diagram.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Fig. 7  Block diagram of a voltage standard system.]]
         
A phase-locked oscillator (PLO) operating at a frequency near 75&amp;nbsp;GHz provides the microwave power to the chip. The primary requirements for the 75&amp;nbsp;GHz source are: (1) its frequency must be known with high accuracy ( 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; ) and (2) it should produce a stable output power of at least 50&amp;nbsp;mW. It is useful, although not essential, to be able to tune the source over a range of frequencies.  The PLO may be constructed using a commercial microwave counter with feedback capability or it may be a custom built phase-locked loop.  More recently microwave frequency synthesizers that are more reliable and offer a wider tuning range and resolution have become the preferred microwave source.  The frequency reference for the system is usually a 10&amp;nbsp;MHz sine wave derived from a GPS receiver or an atomic clock.

The zero crossing steps of Fig. 1b allow a single bias current passing through the entire junction array while insuring that every junction in the array is on a constant voltage step.  This leads to significant complication in setting the array to a particular desired step.  Figure 8a illustrates a simplified diagram of the bias circuit.  In this circuit a computer sets the bias voltage &lt;math&gt;V_s&lt;/math&gt; with one digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and uses a second DAC to control the bias impedance &lt;math&gt;R_s&lt;/math&gt; via optically modulated resistors.  Figure 8b shows a graphical solution for the stable operating points of the array and illustrates how control of both the bias voltage and the bias impedance is used to select a particular quantum voltage step.&lt;ref&gt;C.A. Hamilton, R.L. Kautz, F.L. Lloyd,, R.L. Steiner, and B.F. Fields, Trans. Instrum. meas.36, 258 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;
The load line plots the range of voltage and current that are defined by the bias supply.  The intersections of this load line with the I-V curve of the array (vertical lines) are possible stable bias points.  Changes to &lt;math&gt;V_s&lt;/math&gt; shift the load line left and right, whereas changes to &lt;math&gt;R_s&lt;/math&gt; change its slope.  To select a step at a given voltage &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt;, the source voltage is set to &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; and the source impedance is set to about &lt;math&gt;f/K_J I_s = 10 \Omega &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_s&lt;/math&gt; is the step height. This makes the load line steep enough to intersect only one or two steps and forces the array to a step at or very near &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt;. Applying a damped oscillation to &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; helps move the array to the step closest to &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt;. After a step is selected, the source impedance is smoothly increased on all four bias connections (load line becomes horizontal) until the array current goes to zero and the array is effectively disconnected from the bias source.  This open-bias condition is the most stable state for the array and eliminates the possibility of any errors resulting from a small series resistance in the array – a common array defect.  Computer control of this three-step process enables the system to find and stabilize the array voltage on a particular step within a few seconds.  High quality Josephson arrays will remain on a selected step for many hours.

Numerous algorithms have been developed to compare a Josephson standard with a secondary standard or another Josephson standard.  These algorithms differ in the amount of averaging used, the type and placement of reversing switches, and the statistical methods used to reduce the data and compute uncertainty.  The selection of an algorithm depends on the type of comparison, the desired level of uncertainty, and the time available.  One commonly used algorithm that is appropriate for calibrations of Zener reference standards is described here.

== Example measurement algorithm ==

[[File:Measurement_loop_diagram.jpg|thumb|400 px|Fig.9  The measurement loop used to determine the voltage of an unknown device relative to the Josephson standard.]]

The voltage of an unknown reference &lt;math&gt;V_R&lt;/math&gt; relative to the Josephson array voltage is determined using the circuit shown in Fig. 9 (a subset of Fig. 7) in which the unknown and the Josephson array are connected in series opposition across a null meter.  A reversing switch is used to eliminate the effect of thermal and other offset voltages.  The step number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and sometimes the frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are adjusted to make the null voltage as small as possible.  The circuit equation can then be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_a - V_\text{null} &amp;= nf/K_J - V_\text{null} \\
                    &amp;= P V_R-V_0-mt-V_\text{noise}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt; V_a = nf/K_J &lt;/math&gt; is the Josephson array voltage, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a combination of  thermal offset voltages and any offset voltage in the nullmeter, mt represents a linear drift component of the offset voltage, &lt;math&gt;P = \pm 1&lt;/math&gt; is the polarity of the reversing switch, &lt;math&gt;V_\text{null}&lt;/math&gt; is the differential null voltage, and &lt;math&gt;V_\text{noise}&lt;/math&gt; represents noise in the unknown, the null meter, and any other sources of random noise.  Now define a parameter &lt;math&gt; V_i = nf/K_J-V_\text{null}&lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt;V_\text{null}&lt;/math&gt; is a measurement at time &lt;math&gt;t_i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is determined from &lt;math&gt;V_\text{null}&lt;/math&gt; using

:&lt;math&gt;n = \operatorname{Round}{(K_J /f)(V_e + V_\text{null})}, (3)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_e&lt;/math&gt; is an initial direct measurement of &lt;math&gt;V_R&lt;/math&gt; by the system voltmeter and the "Round" function means rounded to the nearest integer.  The direct measurement of &lt;math&gt;V_R&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by setting the array to the &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt; step, which can be seen from Fig. 7 to connect the voltmeter directly to the Zener reference.

Based on measurements of &lt;math&gt;V_e &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; V_\text{null} &lt;/math&gt;, a set of values &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; is acquired for &lt;math&gt;P=+1&lt;/math&gt;.  Three successive values of &lt;math&gt;V_{null}&lt;/math&gt; are examined for consistency within 2 μV  before the data are accepted. This eliminates data that may be corrupted by the transient that occurs when there is a spontaneous transition between quantum voltage steps.  Since &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_\text{null}&lt;/math&gt; change by equal amounts during a step transition, &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; remains constant thus making the data collection process relatively immune to step transitions.  Data are collected efficiently even for a Josephson array chip that may be making as many as five transitions per minute.  The scatter in the data that results from noise in the unknown and in the null meter can generally be modeled by a Gaussian process with one standard deviation on the order of  20 to 100 nV.  There are, however, occasional noise spikes that do not fit this process and generate glitches in the &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; data that may lie 1 μV  to 10 μV away from the well behaved data.  An outlier test is used to detect and eliminate such data.

After the collection of the first data set, the polarity of the unknown is reversed (&lt;math&gt;P=-1&lt;/math&gt;), the bias is readjusted to select a step that minimizes &lt;math&gt;V_\text{null}&lt;/math&gt;, and a second set of data is acquired.  Two more reversals generate third and fourth data sets.  Best estimates for &lt;math&gt;V_R, V_0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; are obtained from a least-squares recursion analysis that minimizes the root-sum-square (RSS) error of the set &lt;math&gt;V_i -(P_i V_R-V_0-mt_i)&lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the four data sets.  In typical measurements of Zener standards, the  noise of the standard often dominates the computed value of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.  The type A uncertainty for &lt;math&gt;V_R &lt;/math&gt; is the standard deviation of the mean for the set of &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Typically, this entire calibration algorithm is controlled by a computer and is completed in a few minutes.  Except in the case of data with nonuniform delays between the reversals, a simple average of the absolute values of the full set of &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; is an equally good estimate of &lt;math&gt;V_z&lt;/math&gt;.
   
Systems like that shown in Fig. 7 are used to calibrate secondary standards, such as Weston cells, Zener references, and precise digital voltmeters.  These calibrations are greatly simplified by the fact that the Josephson array voltage can be set to any value &lt;math&gt;V = nf/K_J&lt;/math&gt;, where the integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; can have any value in the range of about -75 000 to +75 000. The typical uncertainty in measurements of 10 V Zener standards is limited by noise in the Zener to about 0.01 ppm. The ability to set the Josephson array to a wide range of discrete voltages also makes it the most accurate tool for measuring the linearity of high-accuracy digital voltmeters.

== Uncertainty ==

While the voltage appearing across the terminals of a Josephson device is, in principle, given exactly by &lt;math&gt;V = nf/K_J&lt;/math&gt;, in any real measurement there are a variety of potential sources of error and uncertainty as listed in Table 2.  In the case of a known error, such as a reference frequency offset or a known leakage resistance, a correction can be made.  It is then the metrologist’s task to assign realistic numbers to all uncertainties including the uncertainty in the corrections.  One method of doing this notes that only items 1 and 2 in Table 2 depend on the voltage across the Josephson array.  All of the other components are about the same regardless of the array voltage.  Therefore, the combined effect of items 3-8 can be quantitatively evaluated by making a set of measurements of a short circuit using exactly the same algorithm that is used for any other measurement.  The standard error resulting from items 3-8 is just the root mean square (RMS) value of the set of short circuit measurements.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Hamilton, and Y. H. Tang, Metrologia, 36, 53 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;
Additional experiments must be performed to estimate frequency and leakage uncertainty.  Internationally accepted procedures for combining uncertainty and establishing confidence intervals is the subject of the BIPM’s Guide to the Evaluation of Uncertainty in Measurement.&lt;ref&gt;Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, Geneva, International Organization for Standardization (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
Typically, the total uncertainty contribution of a Josephson system in a measurement averaging time of a few minutes is a few nanovolts.  Since the most common use of these systems is the calibration of Zener standards with a noise level of 50-100 nV, the contribution of the Josephson system is negligible.

== Traceability and equivalence ==
[[File:NISTvoltChip.jpg|thumb|Josephson junction array chip developed by the National Bureau of Standards as a standard volt]]
A Congressional act in 1904 established the U.S. Legal Volt to be a quantity defined by the National Bureau of Standards, now the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  With the 1990 international agreement on the Josephson representation of the volt, NIST defined the U.S. Legal Volt to be the same as the international volt representation.  Since the success of the first Josephson array voltage standards in 1984, their use has proliferated to more than 70 national measurement institutes (NMIs), military, and commercial laboratories around the world.    This has resulted in some confusion about the traceability of non-NMI's that are in possession of a JVS that is, in principle, as good as the national standard.  Some guidance on this question is provided in International Standards Organization (ISO) documents that state the general principle that intrinsic standards like the JVS, that have participated in a comparison with an NMI, can claim traceability.

{{Descartes}}
'''''La Géométrie''''' was [[publishing|published]] in 1637 as an appendix to ''Discours de la méthode'' (''[[Discourse on the Method]]''), written by [[René Descartes]]. In the ''Discourse'', he presents his method for obtaining clarity on any subject. ''La Géométrie'' and two other appendices, also by Descartes, ''La Dioptrique'' (''Optics'') and ''Les Météores'' (''Meteorology''), were published with the ''Discourse'' to give examples of the kinds of successes he had achieved following his method&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Descartes|2006|loc=p. 1x}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as well as, perhaps, considering the contemporary European social climate of intellectual competitiveness, to show off a bit to a wider audience).
[[File:GeometryDescartes.JPG|thumb|right|250 px|&lt;center&gt;''La Géométrie''&lt;/center&gt;]]
The work was the first to propose the idea of uniting algebra and geometry into a single subject&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Descartes|2006|loc=p.1xiii}} "This short work marks the moment at which algebra and geometry ceased being separate."&lt;/ref&gt; and invented an [[algebraic geometry]] called [[analytic geometry]], which involves reducing [[geometry]] to a form of [[arithmetic]] and [[algebra]] and translating geometric shapes into algebraic equations. For its time this was ground-breaking. It also contributed to the mathematical ideas of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and was thus important in the development of calculus.

==The text==
This appendix is divided into three "books".&lt;ref&gt;this section follows {{harvnb|Burton|2011|loc=pp. 367-375}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Book I is titled ''Problems Which Can Be Constructed by Means of Circles and Straight Lines Only.'' In this book he introduces algebraic notation that is still in use today. The letters at the end of the alphabet, viz., {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, {{mvar|z}}, etc. are to denote unknown variables, while those at the start of the alphabet, {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}, etc. denote constants. He introduces modern exponential notation for powers (except for squares, where he kept the older tradition of writing repeated letters, such as, {{mvar|aa}}). He also breaks with the Greek tradition of associating powers with geometric referents, {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} with an area, {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} with a volume and so on, and treats them all as possible lengths of line segments. These notational devices permit him to describe an association of numbers to lengths of line segments that could be constructed with [[straightedge and compass]]. The bulk of the remainder of this book is occupied by Descartes's solution to "the locus problems of [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]]."&lt;ref&gt;Pappus discussed the problems in his commentary on the ''Conics'' of [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pappus, given three or four lines in a plane, the problem is to find the locus of a point that moves so that the product of the distances from two of the fixed lines (along specified directions) is proportional to the square of the distance to the third line (in the three line case) or proportional to the product of the distances to the other two lines (in the four line case). In solving these problems and their generalizations, Descartes takes two line segments as unknown and designates them {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}. Known line segments are designated {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}, etc. The germinal idea of a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] can be traced back to this work.

In the second book, called ''On the Nature of Curved Lines'', Descartes described two kinds of curves, called by him ''geometrical'' and ''mechanical''. Geometrical curves are those which are now described by algebraic equations in two variables, however, Descartes described them kinematically and an essential feature was that ''all'' of their points could be obtained by construction from lower order curves. This represented an expansion beyond what was permitted by straightedge and compass constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|2004|loc=pp. 88-89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other curves like the [[quadratrix]] and [[spiral]], where only some of whose points could be constructed, were termed mechanical and were not considered suitable for mathematical study. Descartes also devised an algebraic method for finding the normal at any point of a curve whose equation is known. The construction of the tangents to the curve then easily follows and Descartes applied this algebraic procedure for finding tangents to several curves. 

The third book, ''On the Construction of Solid and Supersolid Problems'', is more properly algebraic than geometric and concerns the nature of equations and how they may be solved. He recommends that all terms of an equation be placed on one side and set equal to 0 to facilitate solution. He points out the [[factor theorem]] for polynomials and gives an intuitive proof that a polynomial of degree {{mvar|n}} has {{mvar|n}} roots. He systematically discussed negative and imaginary roots&lt;ref&gt;he was one of the first to use this term&lt;/ref&gt; of equations and explicitly used what is now known as [[Descartes' rule of signs]].

==Aftermath==
Descartes wrote ''La Géométrie'' in French rather than the language used for most scholarly publication at the time, namely Latin. His exposition style was far from clear, the material was not arranged in a systematic manner and he generally only gave indications of proofs, leaving many of the details to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|2004|loc=pp. 103-104}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attitude toward writing is indicated by statements such as "I did not undertake to say everything," or "It already wearies me to write so much about it," that occur frequently. In conclusion, Descartes justifies his omissions and obscurities with the remark that much was deliberately omitted "in order to give others the pleasure of discovering [it] for themselves."

Descartes is often credited with inventing the coordinate plane because he had the relevant concepts in his book,&lt;ref name= Aleksandrov&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematics, its content, methods, and meaning |author1=A. D. Aleksandrov |author2=Andréi Nikoláevich Kolmogórov |author3=M. A.

This and other improvements were added by mathematicians who took it upon themselves to clarify and explain Descartes' work.

This enhancement of Descartes' work was primarily carried out by [[Frans van Schooten]], a professor of mathematics at Leiden and his students. van Schooten published a Latin version of ''La Géométrie'' in 1649 and this was followed by three other editions in 1659−1661, 1683 and 1693. The 1659−1661 edition was a two volume work more than twice the length of the original filled with explanations and examples provided by van Schooten and this students. One of these students, [[Johannes Hudde]] provided a convenient method for determining double roots of a polynomial, known as [[Hudde's rules|Hudde's rule]], that had been a difficult procedure in Descartes's method of tangents. These editions established analytic geometry in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|2004|loc=pp. 108-109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This page is a list of substances or materials generally considered discredited.

A substance can be discredited in one of three ways:

#It was widely believed to exist at one time but no longer is. Such substances are often part of an [[obsolete scientific theory]].
#It was once believed to have drastically different properties from those accepted now. It was widely claimed and believed to possess significant properties that are no longer attributed to it.
#It is currently believed to exist as part of a theory that has not met the theoretical and experimental requirements of mainstream [[science]]. In particular, such a theory must be predictive.

|-
|[[Coronium]]||[[Charles Augustus Young]] and [[William Harkness]]||1869||Chemical element in the solar [[corona]]||In the 1930s, [[Walter Grotrian]] and [[Bengt Edlén]] discovered that the spectral line in question was due to highly ionized iron.

|-
|[[Panacea]]||[[alchemist]]s||ancient||Substance curing all illness||biology and medicine
|-
|[[Philosopher's stone]]||alchemists||ancient||Legendary substance that could transmute lead into precious metals||While lead can be transmuted via nuclear fusion into higher elements like gold, this occurs in the cores of collapsing stars, and cannot possibly be done chemically
|-
|[[Phlogiston]]||[[Johann Joachim Becher]]||1667||Weightless substance present in combustible materials and released when they are burned||modern [[chemistry]], specifically the discovery that combustion is combination of various substances with [[oxidizers]], most commonly oxygen.
|-

|-
|[[Red mercury]]||hoax||1979||Controversial substance supposedly of use to terrorists||Its actual nature, if any, is unclear. The notion may have been invented for use by Soviet and Russian sting operations targeting nuclear materials trafficking. It is also possible that the phrase may have originated as a codeword in Soviet nuclear weapons development, much as the word "copper" was once used to obfuscate "plutonium" during the [[Manhattan Project]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2731">'''Major Watt Espy, Jr.''' (March 2, 1933 – August 13, 2009) was a researcher and expert on [[capital punishment in the United States]].

Espy, a resident of [[Headland, Alabama]], attended the [[University of Alabama]] where he was a member of [[Phi Sigma Kappa]] fraternity. Even in college he had garnered a reputation as an engaging speaker, serving as toastmaster for the 30th anniversary banquet of the chapter, held in 1955. He graduated in 1957.&lt;ref name="Signet, May 1955"&gt;{{Cite journal

Espy was an author, with John Ortiz Smykla, of [[Capital punishment in the United States#History|''The Espy Files'']], a database of executions carried out in the [[United States]] and preceding territories from 1608, which is the most complete source of data on the issue, identifying 15,487 people put to death.

He began his research in the 1970s when he was a salesman, working with everything from cemetery plots to security systems. While making calls he'd stop at a prison or courthouse for information. He became a full-time researcher in 1977.

Espy became a [[capital punishment|death penalty]] opponent due to his concerns about racial bias, innocence and lack of deterrence.  Espy served as a citizen witness to exactly one execution - that of  [[John Louis Evans]] in the Alabama electric chair on April 22, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.20somethingreads.com/reviews/the-last-face-youll-ever-see-the-private-life-of-the-american-death-penalty/excerpt&lt;/ref&gt;

Espy died aged 76 on August 13, 2009.

[[Image:Mural Quadrant - by John Bird - London 1773.jpg|thumb|300px|Mural quadrant constructed as a frame mounted on a wall.  This instrument was made by [[John Bird (astronomer)|John Bird]] in 1773 and is in the Museum of the History of Science, University of Oxford.]]
A '''mural instrument''' is an angle measuring device mounted on or built into a wall. For astronomical purposes, these walls were oriented so they lie precisely on the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. A mural instrument that measured angles from 0 to 90 degrees was called a '''mural quadrant'''. They were utilized as astronomical devices in [[ancient Egypt]] and [[ancient Greece]]. [[Edmond Halley]], due to the lack of an assistant and only one vertical wire in his [[Meridian circle|transit]], confined himself to the use of a mural quadrant built by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] after its erection in 1725 at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]]. [[James Bradley|Bradley]]'s first observation with that quadrant was made on 15 June 1742.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Grant (astronomer)|Robert Grant]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nZvg5aS24zEC&amp;pg=PA483 History of Physical Astronomy from The Earliest Ages to the Nineteenth Century]'' (1852) pp. 483-484.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[Image:BirdQuadrant.jpg| thumb | left | A Bird Mural Quadrant was for many years the main instrument of the [[Mannheim Observatory]], shown here installed]]

Many older mural quadrants have been constructed by marking directly on the wall surfaces. More recent instruments were made with a frame that was constructed with precision and mounted permanently on the wall.

The arc is marked with divisions, almost always in [[Degree (angle)|degree]]s and fractions of a degree.  In the oldest instruments, an indicator is placed at the centre of the [[Arc (geometry)|arc]].  An observer can move a device with a second indicator along the arc until the line of sight from the movable device's indicator through the indicator at the centre of the arc aligns with the [[astronomical object]].  The angle is then read, yielding the [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|elevation]] or altitude of the object.  In smaller instruments, an [[alidade]] could be used.  More modern mural instruments would use a [[telescope]] with a [[reticle#Use in Surveying and Astronomy|reticle]] eyepiece to observe the object.

Many mural quadrants were constructed, giving the observer the ability to measure a 90° range of [[elevation]].  There were also [[sextant (astronomical)|mural sextants]] that read 60°.

==Usage==
In order to measure the position of, for example, a star, the observer needs a [[sidereal time|sidereal clock]] in addition to the mural instrument.  With the clock measuring time, a star of interest is observed with the instrument until it crosses an indicator showing that it is [[Astronomical transit|transit]]ing the meridian.  At this instant, the time on the clock is recorded as well as the angular elevation of the star.  This yields the position in the coordinates of the instrument.  If the instrument's arc is not marked relative to the celestial equator, then the elevation is corrected for the difference, resulting in the star's [[declination]].  If the sidereal clock is precisely synchronized with the stars, the time yields the [[right ascension]] directly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.kde.org/development/en/kdeedu/kstars/ai-sidereal.html Sidereal Time]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pseudorandom''' process is a process that appears to be [[randomness|random]] but is not. Pseudorandom sequences typically exhibit [[statistical randomness]] while being generated by an entirely [[Deterministic system|deterministic causal process]]. Such a process is easier to produce than a genuinely random one, and has the benefit that it can be used again and again to produce exactly the same numbers, which is useful for testing and fixing software.

To generate truly random numbers would require precise, accurate, and repeatable system measurements of absolutely non-deterministic processes. [[Linux]] uses, for example, various system timings (like user keystrokes, I/O, or least-significant digit voltage measurements) to produce a pool of random numbers. It attempts to constantly replenish the pool, depending on the level of importance, and so will issue a random number. This system is an example, and similar to those of dedicated hardware random number generators. Even with all of this work, it is not truly random.

==History==

The generation of random numbers has many uses (mostly in [[statistics]], for random [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]], and [[simulation]]). Before modern computing, researchers requiring random numbers would either generate them through various means ([[dice]], [[playing cards|cards]], [[roulette|roulette wheels]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  etc.) or use existing random number tables.

The first attempt to provide researchers with a ready supply of random digits was in 1927, when the Cambridge University Press published a table of 41,600 digits developed by [[L.H.C. Tippett]]. In 1947, the [[RAND Corporation]] generated numbers by the electronic simulation of a roulette wheel;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1418/index2.html|title=A Million Random Digits {{!}} RAND|website=www.rand.org|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the results were eventually published in 1955  as ''[[A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates]]''.

==Almost random==
A pseudorandom variable is a variable which is created by a [[deterministic algorithm]], often a computer program or subroutine, which in most cases takes random bits as input. The pseudorandom string will typically be longer than the original random string, but less random (less [[Information entropy|entropic]] in the [[information theory]] sense). This can be useful for randomized algorithms.

[[Pseudorandom number generator]]s are widely used in such applications as computer modeling (e.g., [[Markov chain]]s), statistics, experimental design, etc.

==In computational complexity==
In [[theoretical computer science]], a [[probability distribution|distribution]] is '''pseudorandom''' against a class of adversaries if no adversary from the class can distinguish it from the uniform distribution with significant advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Oded Goldreich. Computational Complexity: A Conceptual Perspective. Cambridge University Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
This notion of pseudorandomness is studied in [[computational complexity theory]] and has applications to [[cryptography]].

Formally, let ''S'' and ''T'' be finite sets and let '''F''' = {''f'': ''S'' → ''T''} be a class of functions.  A [[probability distribution|distribution]] '''D''' over ''S'' is ε-'''pseudorandom''' against '''F''' if for every ''f'' in '''F''', the [[total variation distance|statistical distance]] between the distributions ''f''(''X''), where ''X'' is sampled from '''D''',  and ''f''(''Y''), where ''Y'' is sampled from the [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]] on ''S'', is at most ε.

In typical applications, the class '''F''' describes a model of computation with bounded resources
and one is interested in designing distributions '''D''' with certain properties that are pseudorandom against '''F'''.  The distribution '''D''' is often specified as the output of a [[pseudorandom generator]].

==Cryptography==

{{See also|Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator}}

Though random numbers are needed in [[cryptography]], the use of [[Pseudorandom number generator|pseudorandom number generators]] (whether [[Hardware random number generator|hardware]] or [[Random number generation|software]] or some combination) is insecure. When random values are required in cryptography, the goal is to make a message as hard to crack as possible, by eliminating or obscuring the parameters used to encrypt the message (the [[key (cryptography)|key]]) from the message itself or from the context in which it is carried.  Pseudorandom sequences are deterministic and reproducible; all that is required in order to discover and reproduce a pseudorandom sequence is the algorithm used to generate it and the initial [[Seed (randomness)|seed]].  So the entire sequence of numbers is only as powerful as the randomly chosen parts - sometimes the algorithm and the seed, but usually only the seed.

There are many examples in cryptographic history of ciphers, otherwise excellent, in which random choices were not random enough and security was lost as a direct consequence. The [[World War II]] [[Japan]]ese [[PURPLE]] cipher machine used for diplomatic communications is a good example. It was consistently broken throughout World War II, mostly because the "key values" used were insufficiently random. They had patterns, and those patterns made any intercepted traffic readily decryptable. Had the keys (i.e. the initial settings of the stepping switches in the machine) been made unpredictably (i.e. randomly), that traffic would have been much harder to break, and perhaps even secure in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-the-u-s-cracked-japans-purple-encryption-machine-458385664|title=How the U.S. Cracked Japan's 'Purple Encryption Machine' at the Dawn of World War II|last=Alberto-Perez|work=io9|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In security==

Since pseudorandom numbers are in fact deterministic, a given seed will always determine the same pseudorandom number.  This attribute is used in security, in the form of [[rolling code]] to avoid [[replay attack]]s, in which a command would be intercepted to be used by a thief at a later time.&lt;ref&gt;Brain, M., "[https://auto.howstuffworks.com/remote-entry.htm How Remote Entry Works]", ''HowStuffWorks''  Auto Auto Basics. Retrieved July 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monte Carlo method simulations==

A [[Monte Carlo method]] simulation is defined as any method that utilizes sequences of random numbers to perform the simulation.  Monte Carlo simulations are applied to many topics including [[quantum chromodynamics]], cancer radiation therapy, traffic flow, [[stellar evolution]] and VLSI design.  All these simulations require the use of random numbers and therefore [[pseudorandom number generator]]s, which makes creating random-like numbers very important.

A simple example of how a computer would perform a Monte Carlo simulation is the calculation of [[Pi|π]].  If a square enclosed a circle and a point were randomly chosen inside the square the point would either lie inside the circle or outside it.  If the process were repeated many times, the ratio of the random points that lie inside the circle to the total number of random points in the square would approximate the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square.  From this we can estimate pi, as shown in the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code below utilizing a [[SciPy]] package to generate pseudorandom numbers with the [[Mersenne twister|MT19937]] algorithm.  Note that this method is a computationally inefficient way to [[Numerical approximations of π|numerically approximate π]].
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
import scipy
N=100000
x_array = scipy.random.rand(N) 
y_array = scipy.random.rand(N)

A '''quadratic Lie algebra''' is a [[Lie algebra]] together with a compatible symmetric bilinear form.  Compatibility means that it is invariant under the [[adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]].  Examples of such are [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s, such as [[SU(N)#Lie algebra|su(n)]] and [[special linear group#Lie subgroup|sl(n,'''R''')]].

== Definition ==
A quadratic Lie algebra is a Lie algebra ('''g''',[.,.]) together with a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form &lt;math&gt;(.,.)\colon \mathfrak{g}\otimes\mathfrak{g}\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; that is invariant under the adjoint action, i.e.
:([''X'',''Y''],''Z'')+(''Y'',[''X'',''Z''])=0
where ''X,Y,Z'' are elements of the Lie algebra '''g'''.
A localization/ generalization is the concept of [[Courant algebroid]] where the vector space '''g''' is replaced by (sections of) a [[vector bundle]].

== Examples ==
As a first example, consider ''R''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; with zero-bracket and standard inner product
:&lt;math&gt;((x_1,\dots,x_n),(y_1,\dots,y_n)):= \sum_j x_jy_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the bracket is trivial the invariance is trivially fulfilled.

As a more elaborate example consider [[SO(3)#Lie algebra|so(3)]], i.e. ''R''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with base ''X,Y,Z'', standard inner product, and Lie bracket
:&lt;math&gt;[X,Y]=Z,\quad [Y,Z]=X,\quad [Z,X]=Y&lt;/math&gt;.
Straightforward computation shows that the inner product is indeed preserved.  A generalization is the following.

=== Semisimple Lie algebras ===
A big group of examples fits into the category of semisimple Lie algebras, i.e. Lie algebras whose adjoint representation is faithful.  Examples are [[special linear group#Lie subgroup|sl(n,R)]] and [[SU(N)#Lie algebra|su(n)]], as well as [[direct sum of Lie algebras|direct sum]]s of them.  Let thus '''g''' be a semi-simple Lie algebra with adjoint representation ''ad'', i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ad}\colon\mathfrak{g}\to\mathrm{End}(\mathfrak{g}):X\mapsto (\mathrm{ad}_X\colon Y\mapsto [X,Y])&lt;/math&gt;.
Define now the [[Killing form]]
:&lt;math&gt;k\colon\mathfrak{g}\otimes\mathfrak{g}\to\mathbb{R}: X\otimes Y \mapsto -\mathrm{tr}(\mathrm{ad}_X\circ\mathrm{ad}_Y)&lt;/math&gt;.
Due to the [[Cartan criterion]], the Killing form is non-degenerate if and only if the Lie algebra is semisimple.

If '''g''' is in addition a [[simple Lie algebra]], then the Killing form is up to rescaling the only invariant symmetric bilinear form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2780">'''Rational analysis''' is a theoretical framework, methodology, and research program in [[cognitive science]] that has been developed by [[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John Anderson]].&lt;ref name="anderson91"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=J. R. |year=1991 |title=Is human cognition adaptive? |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=14 |pages=471–517 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00070801}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anderson90"&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1990). "The adaptive character of thought". Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of rational analysis as a research program is to explain the function and purpose of [[cognitive processes]] and to discover the structure of the mind. Chater and Oaksford contrast it with the [[Mechanical philosophy#Mechanism and determinism|mechanistic]] explanations of cognition offered by both [[Cognitive model|computational model]]s and [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref name="chater99"/&gt;

Rational analysis starts from the assumption that the mind is adapted to its environment. Rational analysis uses this assumption to investigate the structure and purpose of [[representations]] and [[cognitive processes]] by studying the structure of the environment. The methodology of rational analysis comprises six steps:&lt;ref name="anderson91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chater99"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chater |first1=N. |last2=Oaksford |first2=M. |year=1999 |title=Ten years of the rational analysis of cognition |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=3 |number=2 |pages=57–65 |url=http://www.dectech.co.uk/publications/LinksNick/FoundationsTheoryAndMethodology/ten%20years%20of%20the%20rational%20analysis%20of%20cognition.pdf |doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(98)01273-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Goals: Specify precisely the goals of the cognitive system.
#Environment: Develop a formal model of the environment to which the system is adapted.
#Computational Limitations: Make the minimal assumptions about computational limitations.
#Optimization: Derive the optimal behavioral function given 1-3 above. 
#Data: Examine the empirical literature to see whether the predictions of the behavioral function are confirmed.
#Iteration: Repeat, iteratively refining the theory

Rational analysis has been applied to memory, categorization, causal inference, problem solving,&lt;ref name="anderson90"/&gt; and reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oaksford | first1 = M. | last2 = Chater | first2 = N. | year = 1994 | title = A rational analysis of the selection task as optimal data selection | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 101 | issue = 4| pages = 608–631 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.101.4.608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Fiske Griggs''' (22 August 1881 in [[Brooklyn, Connecticut]]&lt;ref name =wku&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/chronob/GRIG1881.htm |title=Chrono-Biographical Sketch: Robert F. Griggs |author=Charles H. Smith |year=2007 |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 10 June 1962), was a botanist who led a 1915 [[National Geographic Society]] expedition to observe the aftermath of the [[Mount Katmai|Katmai]] volcanic eruption.

In June 1917, Griggs and the eager NGS explorers rushed to the Katmai coast with the express goal of exploring the [[Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes]]. They quickly worked their way up through the ash-filled Katmai River valley and over the pass. It was a month of terror and elation for the twelve adventurers. Through the long Alaska summer days, they took chemical and geologic samples, shot photographs, and made rough maps. Mincing their way across the crumbling, treacherous surface of the hot ash, they studied the temperatures and temperaments of the roaring fumaroles and explored the perilous margins of the pyroclastic deposits. As they explored and documented the valley, they began to build a picture of the eruption. For five years, the American public had been entranced by the exciting volcanic discoveries in Alaska. Hungry for stories to push the horrors of World War I from their minds, thousands of National Geographic subscribers were thrilled to read Griggs’ gripping articles about the adventures of his exploring parties.

As the discoveries unfolded, Griggs became increasingly zealous in his advocacy of the site. His vivid descriptions of the wonders of the Katmai country ignited the interest of what was then a budding conservation movement in the United States. The mysterious volcanic valley seemed an ideal candidate for protection. Griggs and the chiefs of the National Geographic Society campaigned persistently to preserve the area, and in 1918, President Woodrow Wilson declared {{convert|1700|sqmi|km2}} of land as [[Katmai National Monument]].

'''Sven Erik Jørgensen''' (August 29, 1934 – March 5, 2016 in [[Copenhagen]]) was an [[ecologist]] and [[chemist]].  He became professor emeritus in environmental chemistry at the University of Copenhagen. He received in 1958 a master of science in chemical engineering from the Danish Technical University, then doctor of environmental engineering (Karlsruhe University) and doctor of science in ecological modelling (Copenhagen University). He was an honourable doctor at Coimbra University, Portugal and at Dar es Salaam University, Tanzania. In 1975 he founded a journal, ''[[Ecological Modelling]]'', and in 1978 ISEM, the International Society of Ecological Modelling. He received several awards: the Ruder Boskovic Medal, the Prigogine Prize, the Pascal Medal, the Einstein professorship at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Santa Chiara Prize for multidisciplinary teaching, and in 2004, together with William Mitsch, the Stockholm Water Prize. He published 366 papers of which 275 were in peer-reviewed international journals, and edited or authored 76 books, of which several have been translated into other languages (Chinese, Russian, Spanish, and Portuguese). He authored a textbook in ecological modeling “Fundamentals of Ecological Modelling”, which was published as a fourth edition together with Brian Fath in 2011. It has been translated into Chinese and Russian (third edition). Recently he authored the textbook “Introduction to Systems Ecology”. It was published in English in 2012 and in Chinese in 2013. He was editor in chief of the Encyclopedia of Ecology published in 2008, and of the Encyclopedia of Environmental Management published during December 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2788">'''Synchronous context-free grammars''' ('''SynCFG''' or '''SCFG'''; not to be confused with [[Stochastic context-free grammar|stochastic CFGs]]) are a type of [[formal grammar]] designed for use in [[transfer-based machine translation]]. Rules in these grammars apply to two languages at the same time, capturing grammatical structures that are each other's translations.

The theory of SynCFGs borrows from [[syntax-directed transduction]] and [[syntax-based machine translation]], modeling the reordering of clauses that occurs when translating a sentence by correspondences between phrase-structure rules in the source and target languages. Performance of SCFG-based MT systems has been found comparable with, or even better than, state-of-the-art [[phrase-based machine translation]] systems.&lt;ref name="Chiang"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several algorithms exist to perform translation using SynCFGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formalism==
Rules in a SynCFG are superficially similar to CFG rules, except that they specify the structure of two phrases at the same time; one in the source language (the language being translated) and one in the target language. Numeric indices indicate correspondences between non-terminals in both constituent trees. Chiang&lt;ref name="Chiang"/&gt; gives the Chinese/English example:

: {{math|''X'' →}} (yu {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} you {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, have {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} with {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}})

This rule indicates that an {{mvar|X}} phrase can be formed in Chinese with the structure "yu {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} you {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}", where {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are variables standing in for subphrases; and that the corresponding structure in English is "have {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} with {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}" where {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are independently translated to English.

'''''The Helix''''' was a bi-monthly teen [[List of science magazines|science magazine]] published by [[CSIRO Publishing]], as the young-adult bi-monthly magazine of the Double Helix Science Club.&lt;ref&gt;The Helix Issue 162, June–July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was established in 1986 as the newsletter for the science club. Soon afterwards, it grew into a [[magazine]] in its own right. In 1999, a spin-off science magazine for younger readers, called ''[[Scientriffic]]'', was created.

The magazine was usually 40 pages long and trimmed to [[quarto]] paper size. It typically contained articles about [[science]] and [[mathematics]] of interest to teens.

The magazine was relaunched in July 2015 as [[Double Helix]], combining both ''Scientriffic'' and ''The Helix'' into one magazine, starting from Issue 1, with 8 issues per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doublehelixshop.csiro.au/en/Double%20Helix%20changes.aspx|title=Double Helix changes|work=csiro.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editors==
The final [[editor-in-chief]] was Sarah Kellett. Previous editors have included Ross Kingsland, Darren Osborne, Simon Torok, Kath Kovac, Gabrielle Tramby, Maaroof Fakhri and Jasmine Fellows.

'''Umoove''' is a [[high tech]] [[startup company]] that has developed and patented a software-only face and [[eye tracking]] technology. The idea was first conceived as an attempt to aid people with disabilities but has since evolved. The only compatibility qualification for [[tablet computers]] and [[smartphones]] to run Umoove software is a front-facing camera. 
Umoove headquarters are in [[Israel]] on [[Jerusalem]]’s [[Har Hotzvim]].

Umoove has 15 employees and received two million dollars in financing in 2012. The company’s original founders invested around $800,000 to start the business in 2010.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|title=NewYorkTimes|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/eye-tracking-tech-will-be-open-to-iphones-others/?_r=0|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013 Umoove was named one of the top three most promising Israeli start ups by Newsgeeks magazine.&lt;ref name="21c"&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel21C|url=http://israel21c.org/technology/Umoove-operates-your-mobile-through-head-movements-alone/|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company also participated in the 2013 [[LeWeb]] conference in [[Paris]], [[France]], where innovative technology startups are showcased.&lt;ref name="YKL"&gt;{{cite web|title=LeWebsite|url=http://paris.leweb.co/participants/speakers/yitzi-kempinski/umoove|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

==Technology==
The technology uses information extracted from previous frames, such as the angle of the user’s head to predict where to look for facial targets in the next frame. This anticipation minimizes the amount of computation needed to scan each image.&lt;ref name="spc"&gt;{{cite web|title=SpectrumWebsite|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/eyetracking-software-goes-mobile|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Umoove accounts for variances in environment, lighting conditions and user hand shake/movement. The technology is designed to provide a consistent experience, whether you’re in a brightly lit area or a darkened basement, and to work fluidly between them by adapting its processing when it detects color and brightness shifts. It uses an active stabilization technique to filter out natural body movements from an unstable camera in order to minimize false-positive motion detection.&lt;ref name="tch"&gt;{{cite web|title=TechCrunch|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/Umoove-is-poised-to-blanket-the-world-with-mobile-head-tracking-tech-with-or-without-the-galaxy-s-iv/|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Running the Umoove software on a [[Samsung Galaxy S3]] is said to take up only 2% [[CPU]].&lt;ref name="spc"/&gt;
Umoove works exclusively with software and there is no hardware add-on necessary. It can be run on any [[smartphone]] or [[tablet computer]] that has a front-facing camera. Umoove claims that even a low-quality camera on an old device will run their software flawlessly.

==Umoove Experience==
In January 2014 Umoove released its first game onto the app store.&lt;ref name="ITN"&gt;{{cite web|title=iTunes|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/umoove-experience-3d-face/id731389410?mt=8//|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Umoove Experience game lets users control where they are 'flying' in the game through simple gestures and motions with their head. The [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] will basically go toward wherever the user looks.&lt;ref name="BGR"&gt;{{cite web|title=BGRwebsite|url=http://bgr.com/2014/01/14/best-iphone-game-favorites-umoove//|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was created to showcase the technology for game developers&lt;ref name="TUA"&gt;{{cite web|title=TUAWWEBSITE|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2014/01/15/fly-through-umoove-experience-an-addictive-ios-game-that-uses-f//|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that did not stop some from criticizing its simplicity.&lt;ref name="CNT"&gt;{{cite web|title=CNETWEBSITE|url=http://www.cnet.com.au/iphone-game-tracks-face-movement-for-in-game-navigation-339346418.htm//|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Umoove also announced that they raised another one million dollars and that they are opening offices in [[Silicon Valley]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="GEK"/&gt;

In February 2014, Umoove announced that their face-tracking [[software development kit]] is available for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] developers as well as [[iOS]].&lt;ref name="NCH"&gt;{{cite web|title=TechCrunchFeb14|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/umoove-android-adk-beta/|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
The Umoove Experience garnered mostly positive reviews&lt;ref name="GIG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gigaom|url=http://gigaom.com/2014/01/14/this-awesome-ios-game-tracks-your-head-movement-to-control-the-direction-you-fly//|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; from bloggers and mainstream media with some predicting that it could be the future of [[mobile gaming]].&lt;ref name="BGR"/&gt; [[Mashable]] wrote that Umoove’s technology could be the emergence of [[gesture recognition]] technology in the mobile space, similar to [[Kinect]] with console gaming and what [[Leap Motion]] has done with desktop computers.&lt;ref name="MSH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mashable|url=http://mashable.com/2014/01/15/this-app-lets-you-control-a-game-using-face-tracking//|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, however, remain skeptical. [[CNET]], for example, did not give the game a positive review and called the [[eye tracking]] technology ‘freaky but cool’. They also noted that pioneering technologies have been known to fall short of expectations, citing [[Apple Inc]]’s [[Siri]] as an example. The technology blog [[GigaOM]] said that the Umoove Experience is ’awesome’&lt;ref name="GIG"/&gt; and [[technology evangelist]] [[Robert Scoble]] has called Umoove "brilliant".&lt;ref name="RSV"&gt;{{cite web|title=ScoblePlus|url=https://plus.google.com/+Scobleizer/posts/SKQEzTymKrk|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==uHealth==
In January 2015, Umoove released uHealth, an [[mobile application]] that uses [[eye tracking]] game-like exercise to challenge the user’s ability to be attentive, continuously focus, follow commands and avoid distractions. The app is designed in the form of two games, one to improve attention and another that hones focus.&lt;ref name="CTV"&gt;{{cite web|title=CTV|url= http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/israeli-start-up-creates-app-to-help-concentration-1.2225346|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
uHealth is a training tool, not a [[diagnostic]]. Umoove has stated that they want to use their technology for diagnosing [[neurological disorders]] but this will depend on clinical tests and [[FDA]] approval.&lt;ref name="T2I"&gt;{{cite web|title=TimesofIsraelShamah|url= http://www.timesofisrael.com/eye-tracking-tech-focuses-on-the-challenge-of-focus/|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company cites the direct relationship between [[eye movements]] and [[brain activity]] as well as various vision based therapies have been backed by many scientific studies conducted over the past decades. uHealth is the first time this type of therapy is delivered right to the end user through a simple download.&lt;ref name="RNN"&gt;{{cite web|title=RapidNewsNetwork|url= http://rapidnewsnetwork.com/umoove-launches-eye-tracking-based-ios-app-improving-attention-focus/7955/|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaboration rumors==
In March 2013 there were rumors on the internet that Umoove would be the functioning software embedded into the [[Samsung Galaxy S4]], which was due to launch that month. This rumor was perpetrated by, among others, [[New York Times]],&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; [[Techcrunch]]&lt;ref name="tch"/&gt; and [[Yahoo]].&lt;ref name="YHO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo|url=https://news.yahoo.com/galaxy-iv-eye-tracking-tech-coming-iphone-other-152506303.html;_ylt=A2KJ2PbcKUhRHUgAOhvQtDMD|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Once Samsung launched without the Umoove technology rumors about a potential collaboration with [[Apple Inc]] hit the web. It has been said that due to the fact that [[Apple Inc]] is losing market share and stock value to Samsung they will be more aggressive and [[eye tracking]] is a logical place to make that move.&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite web|title=TimesofIsrael|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/does-the-new-iphone-feature-israeli-start-ups-eye-tracking-tech/|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
