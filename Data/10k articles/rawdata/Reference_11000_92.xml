      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4018">An '''adoption reunion registry''' is a formal mechanism where [[adoptee]]s and their birth family members can be reunited. Registries may be free or charge fees, be facilitated by non-profit organizations, government agencies or private businesses.

Generally, such [[adoption]] registries exist only in countries which practiced ''[[closed adoption]]'', i.e. adoption in which the full identities of the birth parents, birth family members and the adopting family are not readily disclosed.

Some reunion registries are based on mutual consent and do matches from the information provided by the registrants. Others, run by governmental agencies, have access to the original documents identifying a birth family or adopting family.  This is a form of [[adoption disclosure]].  In general, adoptees must be adults before they may be given identifying information, or at least age 18. In the [[United States]], state law governs whether such an institution may release this identifying information to the interested party.  Some states have an adoption registry, in which both the adopted adult and birthparent must register before information will be provided. In other states, if the adoptee requests information, the organization will contact the birth parent and request consent for a reunion.

In [[Canada]], adult adoptees from [[British Columbia]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], and [[Ontario]] generally have access to their own birth and adoption information provided no disclosure veto has been filed.  In other provinces/territories, limited access to information is allowed; all jurisdictions have some form of reunion register. 

In the [[United Kingdom]], adoption law has been amended to allow for [[open adoption]]s, the right to access one's records, and a state-run adoption reunion registry has been established.

Though many such registries are operated by government agencies, many private registries do exist, and can be found on the Web.  These tend to be owned and/or managed by members of the adoption community and are generally more successful than government-run registries.  The largest such organization is the International Soundex Reunion Registry, Inc., (ISRR) founded in 1975. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dadpeter.co.uk/forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

A problem generally with state-run registries has been the lack of publicity surrounding them.  In contrast, in April 2005, the state-run National Adoption Contact Preference Register[http://www.dadpeter.co.uk/forum] was launched in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] with a national radio and newspaper advertising campaign, and included an application form for the registry being delivered to every household.  The Irish registry allows a person using it to specify whether or not they want contact and/or reunion, what form that contact should take (e.g., letter, phone, e-mail), and, if they do not want contact at the time being, still allows for the passing of medical and/or background information to the other party.

"'''And Now For a Word'''" is an episode from the second season of the science fiction television series ''[[Babylon 5]]''. The documentary format used in this episode was later revisited for the fourth-season episode "[[The Illusion of Truth]]".

==Synopsis==
{{long plot|date=October 2009}}
Cynthia Torqueman, a reporter for the [[Interstellar Network News|ISN]] network on Earth, is the host of an ISN news series called "36 Hours". As the episode begins Torqueman is seen sitting at her anchor desk at ISN headquarters; she announces that the next segment of "36 Hours" will feature the Babylon 5 station and whether it is worthwhile for the [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]] to continue funding and supporting the station. A number of public [[opinion poll]]s are shown throughout the episode; the polls indicate that humanity's support for the Babylon 5 project is dwindling as the station's proclaimed mission of "creating the peace" falters. A key theme of the "36 Hours" segment is the ongoing Narn-Centauri War. As Torqueman's ship approaches the station, its cameras record [[Narn]] and [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] merchant ships opening fire on one another. Torqueman interviews Dr. Stephen Franklin, Babylon 5's medical chief, who is obviously irritated by her questions as he rushes to save the lives of various Narn and Centauri who have been wounded in the battle.

Torqueman spends most of her time on Babylon 5 interviewing the station's human command staff, its leading alien ambassadors, and talking with ordinary humans on the station (such as dockworkers). She also interviews an Earth Alliance Senator named Ronald Quantrell, who equivocates on the Project's success and claims that Earth only supported the station immediately after the [[Earth–Minbari War]], when Earth's weakness forced it to promote galactic peace. Quantrell claims that, since the Earth Alliance has rebuilt and improved its military forces to a much greater strength since the war, the Alliance no longer needs to promote galactic peace or fund the expensive Babylon 5 station. His comments are strongly criticized by Captain [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]], Babylon 5's commanding officer, who argues that Earth still doesn't have the level of technology to fight the Minbari, Centauri, or "god forbid" the Vorlons, and that Babylon 5 is still the "last, best hope for peace" in the galaxy. However, Sheridan's message is belied by the continued fighting between the Narn and Centauri. Ambassador [[G'Kar]] of the Narn claims that the Centauri have been using Babylon 5 (supposedly neutral territory) to load illegal [[mass driver]] weapons onto their merchant ships to attack the Narn. Ambassador [[Londo Mollari]] of the Centauri Republic disputes this and claims that the Narn are lying. Both ambassadors are interviewed by Torqueman; G'Kar tells her of the Centauri occupation and enslavement of his homeworld, and of his people's determination to never let it happen again. Londo tells Torqueman that the Centauri only occupied Narn to "help" the Narn raise their standard of living and claims that his people "voluntarily" left Narn when they were asked to do so. Torqueman also interviews [[Delenn]], the Minbari Ambassador, and quizzes her about her physical change into a Minbari/Human hybrid, asking pointedly if it is not an insult to the memory of those who died in the Earth-Minbari War; Delenn is so upset that she cannot finish the interview. Torqueman also gets a first-ever televised glimpse of [[Kosh Naranek|Kosh]], the reclusive [[Vorlon]] ambassador, but he refuses to talk with her.

When Sheridan tells Ambassador Mollari that he has ordered all Centauri merchant vessels to be searched for illegal weapons, Mollari tells him that this "violation" of the Centauri's sovereign rights will not be tolerated. Shortly afterward, a Centauri Primus-Class battlecruiser exits hyperspace directly above Babylon 5 and targets its weapons on the station. Mollari announces that the battlecruiser will blockade Babylon 5 unless Sheridan revokes his order to search Centauri ships. Sheridan believes the Centauri are bluffing and to prove it, he sends a single merchant ship past the Centauri battlecruiser. When the battlecruiser doesn't fire and allows the merchant vessel to leave unharmed, the crew in the command center applauds their commander's seeming victory. However, a Narn G'Quan-Class Heavy Cruiser exits hyperspace and attacks the Centauri battlecruiser. A fierce battle erupts between the two ships; Sheridan tries to get the ships to stop fighting, but to no avail. The Narn cruiser destroys the Centauri cruiser, but is heavily damaged in the process. When it tries to flee, its jump engines explode and the Narn cruiser is destroyed. Torqueman concludes the segment of "36 Hours" by stating that, while Babylon 5 is definitely a dangerous place and will continue to be a source of controversy and conflict, it should also be given more time to fulfill the dreams of its founders.

==Arc significance==
*The [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] are transporting illegal [[mass driver]] weapons for use against the [[Narn]]. A few episodes later these weapons will be used by the Centauri to bombard the Narn homeworld with large [[meteor]]s.
*It is reported that the Narn have lost 6 of the 7 most recent battles in the Narn-Centauri War; and they are losing the war.
* Public support on Earth for the Babylon 5 Project is declining, and a growing number of Earth Alliance Senators oppose continued funding and support for the Babylon 5 station.
* Hidoshi, previously most vocal supporter of Babylon 5 and visible member of the Earth Alliance Senate, is no longer a Senator.

==Production details==
* The Psi-Corps commercial contains a semi-[[subliminal message]]: during the closing of the commercial "The Psi Corps is your friend. Trust the Corps" flashes on the screen.&lt;ref name="hulu"&gt;''Babylon 5'' Season 2 Episode 15, "[http://www.hulu.com/watch/21077/babylon-5-and-now-for-a-word#x-0,vepisode,1 And Now For A Word] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703230626/http://www.hulu.com/watch/21077/babylon-5-and-now-for-a-word#x-0,vepisode,1 |date=July 3, 2008 }}", [[Hulu]], at timestamp 32:25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Season2disc4ep15min32sec24"&gt;{{cite video

L''''aqueduc de Louveciennes''' (Louveciennes Aqueduct), sometimes called '''aqueduc de Marly''' (Marly Aqueduct) is an [[Aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] built in the 17th century under the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], located in [[Louveciennes]] (now in the French département of the Yvelines, in the west suburb of Paris). Now out of service, the aqueduct has been listed as a [[Monument historique]] since 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[[Base Mérimée]] PA00087477&lt;/ref&gt; It was a part of the hydraulic network intended to provide water for the [[château de Marly]] and the [[Gardens of Versailles]] from the [[Seine]] river, using a huge pump called the "[[Machine de Marly]]".

The aqueduct consists of 36 arches.&lt;ref name = "Panel"&gt;From the Information board on the Aqueduct site.&lt;/ref&gt; Its length is 643m for a width varying from 2 to 4.4m, and a height from 10 to 20 metres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index. cfm? Id=s0001987 The aqueduct of Louveciennes on Structurae]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was built by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansard]], then [[Robert de Cotte]],&lt;ref name = "Mérimée"/&gt; from 1681 to 1685.&lt;ref name = "Mérimée" &gt;Service régional de l'inventaire of Ile-de-France, general registry of the cultural heritage, French ministry of Culture, Base Mérimée IA00050205, in 1986&lt;/ref&gt; A monumental machine, called the [[machine de Marly]], situated on the Seine river at [[Bougival]], pumped water out of the river with the help of 14 paddle wheels. By pipes put on two paved inclines, the water was pumped up the 126 metres of the hill of Louveciennes. The water flowed into  the reservoir at the summit of the tour du Levant ("East tower") at the north-eastern end of the aqueduct.&lt;ref name = "Panel"/&gt; Using gravity by a one metre wide and two metres deep canal, sealed inside with lead,&lt;ref name = "Panel"/&gt; the water was directed toward the tour du Jongleur ("tower of the Juggler") at the southern end of the aqueduct.&lt;ref name = "Panel"/&gt; From there, a [[siphon]] ensured the supply of a reservoir called réservoir des Deux Portes and the nearby tanks of Marly and Louveciennes.

The aqueduct was retired from service in 1866 and replaced by underground pipes.&lt;ref name ="Panel"/&gt;

During the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)]], the tour du Levant was used as an observation point by the future German emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] and the chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]].&lt;ref name = "Panel" /&gt; This tower was renovated between 1998 and 2000.&lt;ref name = "Panel" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2123">'''''Bloemfontein Municipality Appellant v Jacksons Limited Respondent'''''&lt;ref&gt;1929 AD 266.&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[South African property law|property]] [[South African law|law]]. Heard in the Appellate Division in [[Bloemfontein]] on March 15 and April 5, 1929, it established the principle that, where a third party has not taken reasonable steps to protect his property from the [[South_African_property_law#Lessor.27s_tacit_hypothec|lessor's tacit hypothec]], the courts will infer that the property was brought onto the leased premises with the implied knowledge and consent of that party.

== Facts ==
"S" bought furniture under a hire-purchase agreement from Jacksons, whereby the latter reserved ownership until payment of the last instalment. "S" subsequently moved to Bloemfontein and leased a house from the municipality. When "S" fell in arrears of rent, the municipality attached the furniture. Jacksons applied for an order that the furniture was not subject to the lessor's tacit hypothec; in other words, that the furniture had been brought to the premises without Jacksons's consent.

== Judgment ==
The court held that the furniture was indeed subject to the lessor's tacit hypothec. Had Jacksons taken reasonable steps to protect its property and to enquire as to its whereabouts, and as to where the purchaser was living, it could not have failed to obtain the necessary information, enabling it to give due notice to the new landlord. It had ample time to do this; under the circumstances, the inevitable inference was that the company had impliedly consented to the furniture's being subject to the tacit hypothec of the landlord. The furniture, therefore, had rightly been attached in execution.

'''''Brown v. Socialist Workers '74 Campaign Committee''''', 459 U.S. 87 (1982), was a United States Supreme Court case that dealt with political speech, and whether a state could require a minor political party to disclosure its membership, expenditures, and contributors.

At the time, most states required political parties to disclose their contributions and expenditures; in 1982, the Court ruled that the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], a minor party in Ohio, was not required to disclose its contributors or recipients, on the basis of retributive animus and harassment if party functionaries did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/09/us/justices-back-minor-political-parties-on-disclosure.html |title=JUSTICES BACK MINOR POLITICAL PARTIES ON DISCLOSURE |last=Greenhouse |first=Linda |date=December 9, 1982 |work=The New York Times |access-date=July 14, 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chair''''' is a public artwork designed as an advertisement by Bassett Furniture, located at the intersection of Martin Luther King Ave. and V. Street S.E., in the [[Anacostia]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States of America]]. ''Chair'' was originally surveyed as part of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian's]] [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] survey in 1994. It was once considered the world's largest chair,&lt;ref name="SOS"&gt;{{cite web | author=Save Outdoor Sculptures! | year=1994 | title=Chair, (sculpture). | work=SOS! | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!323187~!0#focus | accessdate= 1 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been overtaken by works like ''[[Broken Chair]]'' in [[Geneva]] and the temporary ''The Writer'' on [[Hampstead Heath]] in London.

==Description==

The chair, which stands 19 1/2 feet high, is a detail-to-detail replica of a [[Duncan Phyfe]] style chair. Painted brown with a white and brown striped "cushion", the chair is entirely made of [[aluminum]]. Weighing between 4,000 and 4,600 pounds, the chair sits on a concrete base.&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

==Acquisition==

The chair was built in 1959 by Virginia-based furniture maker [[Bassett Furniture]]. The concept for the chair came from Charles Curtis, of the Curtis Brothers Furniture company, as a clever way to bring customers to their family showroom which was located on the grounds where the chair is currently placed.&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

The piece was dedicated on July 11, 1959, and a plaque was placed with it, stating:

:THE WORLD'S LARGEST CHAIR
:PRESENTED TO
:CURTIS BROS.
:FOR THEIR OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP
:AND SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC/BY THE
:BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES.
:THE CHAIR MADE OF SOUND HONDURAS MAHOGANY
:IS 19 1/2 FEET TALL AND WEIGHS 4000 POUNDS
:DEDICATED JULY 11, 1959
:DESIGNED
:LEO M. HIRAMETT
:BUILT BY J. E. BASSETT, JR.&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

==Re-dedication==
John Kidwell, the caretaker of the Chair, frequently patched holes that would form after heavy rains with cement. During the days of August 23–24, 2005, the original Chair was disassembled by a backhoe and taken away for restoration. Made entirely of [[Honduras Mahogany]], the legs had begun to [[Dry rot|rot]]. On April 25, 2006, the chair was returned by Curtis Properties (was Curtis Brothers), however, this was a new chair, made entirely of brown aluminum. Over 250 people attended the re-dedication including [[Anthony A. Williams|Mayor Anthony A. Williams]].&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"&gt;{{cite news | author=Paul Schwartzman | title=The Big Chair, Rebuilt to Last | work=Anacostia | publisher=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/15/AR2006041500871.html | accessdate= 2 Feb 2011 | date=April 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the dedication of a new chair, a new plaque was placed, reading:

:THE BIG CHAIR
:RE-DEDICATION APRIL 25, 2006
:THIS COMMUNITY LANDMARK REPRESENTS THE CURTIS COMPANIES
:LONG-STANDING ALLEGIANCE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND
:STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO UNITY, PROSPERITY, AND GOOD WILL
:TO ALL WASHINGTONIANS AND FRIENDS OF ANACOSTIA.

This new chair was designed by Devery Lomax managed by John Kidwell. It was fabricated by Cinnbar, an Orlando-based business known for their oversized objects, and Nelson's Welding. The new chair cost over $40,000 to build. Upon its delivery, by flatbed truck, overpasses had to be avoided due to the size of the chair.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

==Looking Glass House==

On August 13, 1960, Rebecca Kirby (aka Lynn Arnold) moved "onto" the chair. A 10-by-10-foot cubicle was built and placed on the seat, furnished with a shower, bed, toilet, heater, air conditioner and balcony. Placed upon the chair by way of forklift, Kirby lived in the chair for 42 days. In the cubicle, she would watch TV, read books, and talk on the telephone, as well as dine, as her meals were delivered every day.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

Kirby would step outside onto the balcony every few hours to greet visitors who learned about her living situation due to newspapers advertising her as "Alice in the Looking Glass House". Visitors would be encouraged to guess how long she'd maintain her residency. Her then 14-month-old son, Richard, visited often, being placed in a dumb waiter and sent up to see her.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

After 42 days, Kirby "decided to return to earth," earning $1,500 for her stay.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

==Community reception==

The Chair has been received as a part of neighborhood life since its original installation. Anacostia, a neighborhood that has seen economic and cultural ups and downs prides itself on a landmark that withstands the community's evolution.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

The Chair is often used as a geographic marker for direction giving and holiday celebration; [[Santa Claus]] sits upon the chair during [[Christmas]]. When the Chair was reinstalled in 2006, community members surrounded the giant, clapping, yelling and photographing the new chair.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

During the [[1968 Washington, D.C. riots]] the Chair was one of the few landmarks to go unscathed in a neighborhood heavily affected by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s death.&lt;ref name="Schwartzman"&gt;{{cite news | author=Paul Schwartzman | title=The Return of the Big Chair: A Very Big Deal | work=Anacostia | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/25/AR2006042501682.html | accessdate= 1 Feb 2011 | date=April 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3317">'''Civil Law Initiative''' ({{lang-fr|Fondation pour le droit continental}}) is a public utility private institution headquartered in [[Paris]], aiming at development of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system and promotion of legal balance in the world.
[[Image:Map of the Legal systems of the world (en).png|thumb|300px|Legal systems across the world.]]
The main objective of the Initiative is to develop the influence of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition and its advantages, especially in relation to business and the economy. The Initiative aspires to become a meeting point of the academic world, the legal professions and the business world.

The establishment of the Initiative was announced by the French Minister of Justice on 1 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gouv.fr/index.php?rubrique=10030&amp;article=12162 French Ministry of Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; The founding members of the Initiative were:
*Foundation of French Notaries
*[[Caisse des dépôts et consignations]]
*French National Bar Council
*[[Schneider Electric]]
*[[Veolia]]
*[[Total SA]]

In addition, the Initiative’s Board include representatives of several French ministries (the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Employment, the Ministry of Foreign Affaires and the Ministry of Justice), the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]], as well as the College of Fellows and Association of Friends of the Initiative.

==Partner institutions==

The Civil Law Initiative cooperates with multiple French and International institutions. Aside from the founders and members of the Initiative’s board, the list of partners include, ''inter alia'':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-droitcontinental.org/2en.aspx?sr=241 Civil Law Initiative]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summer University for Continental Law==
The Summer University for Continental Law established by the Initiative was designed to enable the world’s [[comparative law]] specialists (lecturers, the legal professions, business lawyers and graduate students) to meet each year at [[Panthéon-Assas University]] in [[Paris]]. Numerous seminars and presentations on comparative law are given by pre-eminent specialists in the subject. The Summer University offers an intensive training course with a Certificate in Continental Law granted upon completion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-droitcontinental.org/7.aspx Civil Law Initiative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521114226/http://www.fondation-droitcontinental.org/7.aspx |date=2009-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CompactPCI-3U.jpg|thumb|300px|A 3U CompactPCI backplane with J2 (top) and J1 (bottom, with blue key in the middle) connectors. The 32-bit PCI bus is carried on the J1 connector, while the J2 connector pins pass through to another connector on the back.]]
'''CompactPCI''' is a [[computer bus]] interconnect for industrial computers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = PICMG CompactPCI
| publisher = PICMG
| url = https://www.picmg.org/openstandards/compactpci/
| accessdate = 2015-03-19}}
&lt;/ref&gt; combining a [[Eurocard (PCB)|Eurocard]]-type connector and [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] signaling and protocols. [[Printed circuit board|Boards]] are standardized to 3[[rack unit|U]] or 6U sizes, and are typically interconnected via a passive [[backplane]]. The connector pin assignments are standardized by the [[PICMG]] US and PICMG Europe organizations. The connectors and the electrical rules allow for eight boards in a PCI segment. Multiple bus segments are allowed with [[Conventional PCI#PCI bus bridges|bridges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = CompactPCI AdvancedTCA &amp;amp; MicroTCA Systems
| publisher = OpenSystems Media
| url = http://advancedtca-systems.com/
| accessdate = 2006-12-10}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the original Eurocard solutions such as [[VMEbus|VME]], which use connectors with a 0.1&amp;nbsp;inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;mm) pin spacing, CompactPCI cards use metric connectors with a 2-millimeter pin spacing, designed to the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 1076 standard.  3U boards have a 110-pin connector (J1), which carries the 32-bit PCI bus signals, and an optional 110-pin connector (J2), which carries either user-defined I/O or the upper 32&amp;nbsp;bits of an optional 64-bit PCI bus.  6U cards have an identical J1, a J2 that is always used for 64-bit PCI, as well as J3, J4, and J5 connectors for a variety of uses either as user-defined I/O or specified signaling such as Telephony and/or [[Ethernet]] signaling. Hot-plugging is a supported feature of CompactPCI.  Some of the pins are slightly longer to provide proper grounding when devices are inserted and removed.

The backplanes can be designed for 3.3&amp;nbsp;V VIO or 5&amp;nbsp;V VIO operation. These are differentiated by having 'Cadmium Yellow' coloured key for 3.3V or 'Brilliant Blue' colour for 5V operation. If the CompactPCI card operates on a particular VIO voltage the card shall have the respective coloured coding key. If the card is compatible with both voltages then it may not have any coding key. The image above illustrates a 5&amp;nbsp;V VIO 8-slot backplane.

CompactPCI was initially ratified as PICMG 2.0 in late 1995 as a passive backplane for PCI signaling.  The 2.x series of specifications from PICMG provide support for a variety of technologies including Hot Swap (PICMG 2.1), Telephony signaling (PICMG 2.5) and most notably the expansion of the architecture to include switched Ethernet (PICMG 2.16).

Originally designed to support the PCI signaling protocol (and hence the name "CompactPCI"), CompactPCI has grown to include a variety of technologies centered on the application of the 2mm HM connector on the 3U and 6U form factor.  In fact many systems are implemented with no PCI bus on the backplane, such as those implemented with switched Ethernet board interconnection (PICMG 2.16).

A drawback of the design is that the signal pins can become bent when a new device is inserted.

Related standards include '''CompactPCI Express''' and '''CompactPXI''', which follow a similar concept, but substitute the protocols and signaling of [[PCI Express]] and [[PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation|PXI]] respectively.

The abbreviations '''cPCI''', '''CPCI''', '''cPCIe''', and '''CPCIe''' are colloquial terms and are not officially used by PICMG.

In the [[United Kingdom]] (and particularly in [[England and Wales]]) the term '''county record office''' usually refers to a local authority repository, also called a county [[archive]]s.

Such repositories employ specialist staff to administer and conserve the historic and the semi-current records of the parent body. They usually also preserve written materials from a great variety of independent local organisations, churches and schools, prominent families and their estates, businesses, solicitors' offices and ordinary private individuals. 

Archives may have been acquired either through donation or (more generally) by deposit on long-term loan. Local authorities in certain larger cities sometimes administer their own separate '''city record office''', operating along similar lines. Archive repositories are frequently – but by no means exclusively – used by local and family historians for the purposes of original research, since many records can very often have a continuing administrative or legal significance.

==Facilities==
A record office will typically include public searchrooms (including reference books, archive catalogues and other finding aids), environmentally controlled strongrooms, administrative offices, and quite often small exhibition areas&lt;ref&gt;The relevant British Standard for the storage and exhibition of archives, both on and off the premises, is [[BS 5454]].&lt;/ref&gt; together with a conservation room for the specialist repair&lt;ref&gt;The relevant British Standard for the conservation and repair of documents is BS 4971.&lt;/ref&gt; of documents. Searchrooms are generally open at their advertised times without charge, although many offices operate a reader's ticket system. Some, but not all, operate a fee-paying postal service for those who are unable to make personal research visits. All county record offices attempt to work in accordance with the appropriate official [[British Standard]].

==Historical development of the UK archive network==
[[File:Hampshire Record Office, Sussex Street - geograph.org.uk - 1214346.jpg|thumb|[[Hampshire Record Office]], Sussex Street, Winchester]] 
The earliest county record office in the modern sense was the [[Bedfordshire Record Office]], established by [[George Herbert Fowler]] in 1913. To some extent it was operating within established traditions set by the London-based [[Public Record Office]] (now [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]), which first opened in 1838, or by other repositories overseas. Although the statutory operation of such county record offices under the [[Local Government (Records) Act 1962]] was permissive rather than mandatory, the network has gradually expanded. Bristol Record Office (now [[Bristol Archives]]), opened in 1924, has been identified as the second local office to become established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol.gov.uk/node/1295] Bristol Record Office website: "It was the first borough record office in the country and at the time there was only one other local record office in existence."  Retrieved 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The whole network now includes repositories – which operate largely independently of each other – throughout the whole of England and Wales (the most recent being Powys Archives, opened in the 1980s). Often the foundations of many of the earlier collections were the extensive surviving archives originating from a county's [[quarter session]]s – in the county of [[Somerset]] a special muniment room had actually been provided for these as early as 1617.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/AboutSRO.htm] Somerset Heritage Centre website – History of the Somerset Archive Service: "Somerset can claim a longer continuously-known history of official record keeping than any other county in England. A meeting of Quarter Sessions held at Wells in 1617 decided that a room should be provided 'for the safe keeping of the records of the Sessions'. By 1619 Somerset possessed not only its own record room, but also a room adjoining for the use of searchers. The record room stood next to the [[Chain Gate, Wells|Chain Gate]] on the north side of [[Wells Cathedral]], and remained in use for the next 200 years." Retrieved 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many broadly similar repositories in Scotland, Ireland, and overseas. To varying extents they will also help with the care of the county's semi-current or "modern records" using [[records management]] principles, as well as with the selection and preservation of today's records (both paper and digital) for future generations.

During the 19th and 20th centuries some older libraries had also begun to maintain archive collections from their local area, although their facilities and the scope of their collections could vary considerably – as  might their official legal status. There are often overlaps between local studies and record office collections, particularly with respect to printed ephemera, maps, photographs, old newspapers and local reference books. A number of record offices now operate in a formal association with one or more of their county’s principal local studies libraries, although the two professions of [[archivist]] and [[librarian]] generally remain quite distinct.

==Legal status for holding Public Records and other categories==

Public access to central government archives (technically known as '''Public Records''') and by extension to local government records was previously regulated in accordance with instruments such as the [[Public Records Act 1958]] and the [[Public Records Act 1967]]. The 1958 Act enabled county repositories to be appointed by the [[Lord Chancellor]] to hold individually specified classes of Public Records – including local court records.&lt;ref&gt;In practice any such appointments to hold Public Records (as defined by the 1958 Act), together with Manorial and Tithe records, are made on the recommendation of staff of the National Archives – formerly the Public Record Office – following inspections which can be repeated every few years.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to material within record  offices in England &amp; Wales is now largely regulated by the [[Data Protection Act 1998]] and the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]], although these do not necessarily cover privately deposited items, and closure periods may apply in certain cases.&lt;ref&gt;A summary of relevant legislation including the status of record offices was provided by Knightbridge A. A. H., ''Archive Legislation in the United Kingdom'' (Society of Archivists Information Leaflet, 1985), although this does not cover more recent changes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1929 many county record offices in England have also been designated by the local bishop as a [[diocesan record office]], latterly operating under the terms of the [[Parochial Registers and Records Measure 1978]]. Such record offices are often also formally recognised by the [[Master of the Rolls]] as approved repositories for manorial and tithe records (in accordance with the [[Law of Property Act 1922]] and the [[Tithe Act 1936]] (as amended by the [[Local Government Records Act 1962]]).&lt;ref&gt;HMSO: ''Record Repositories in Great Britain, a geographical directory'', 1992 {{ISBN|0-11-440243-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guides to the contents of record offices==

Many county record offices have issued printed guides to their collections, although the addition of new materials can make these go rapidly out of date. Furthermore, many offices also have considerable backlogs of uncatalogued materials. From the 1990s onwards an increasing number of offices have launched online catalogues of varying completeness, linked to their respective websites.

An earlier summary of archive repositories, including brief details of the development of each office together with outlines of their principal holdings, is provided by Janet Foster and Julia Sheppard’s ''British Archives'' (4th edition, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=British Archives: a guide to archive resources in the United Kingdom |editor1-first=Janet |editor1-last=Foster |editor2-first=Julia |editor2-last=Sheppard |edition=4th |location=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2002 |isbn=0333735366 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Select lists for certain specialised categories covering many UK repositories have also been issued by a variety of other publishers, notably the [[Federation of Family History Societies]].

'''David Wallechinsky''' (born '''David Wallace''', February 5, 1948) is an American populist historian and television commentator, the president of the [[International Society of Olympic Historians]] (ISOH) and the founder and editor-in-chief of AllGov.com.

==Early life==
David Wallechinsky was born in Los Angeles to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family,&lt;ref name=JWeekly&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/34806/celebrities |title=Dan Abrams' biodata |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of writer Sylvia Kahn and the author and screenwriter [[Irving Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/david_wallace_born_1948_3789910 |title=David Wallace, Born 02/05/1948 in California |publisher=CaliforniaBirthIndex.org |date=1948-02-05 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His younger sister was fellow author [[Amy Wallace]], a "witch" of [[Carlos Castaneda]] who co-wrote many books with him and their father and authored ''Sorcerer's Apprentice: My Life with Carlos Castaneda'' in 2003.

One day, after he got off an airplane in Britain, the customs officer looked at his passport and remarked, "Ah Wallace, a good Scottish boy coming home." Disquieted, back in the States he discovered that the original family name was Wallechinsky and he adopted that moniker. He was educated at [[Palisades Charter High School|Palisades High School]] in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles]], California, graduating in 1965. One of his classmates was future film critic and talk radio host [[Michael Medved]], and they later wrote ''[[What Really Happened to the Class of '65]]'', a series of interviews with their former classmates. Alone, Wallechinsky went back to his school year and wrote a similar book ''Midterm Report: The Class of '65: Chronicles of an American Generation'' about pupils from across America who left high school in that year.

==Career==
In 1973, Wallechinsky became fed up with almanacs that regurgitated bare facts. He had the idea for a reference book to be read for pleasure; a book that would tell the often untold true tales of history. He worked alone for 12 months before being joined by his father for a further year of research. ''[[The People's Almanac]]'' was published by Doubleday in 1975 and became a best-seller. One of the most popular chapters was a selection of lists and, joined by his father and sister, Wallechinsky wrote ''[[The Book of Lists]]'', which became an international best-seller. Both books spawned not only follow-up editions but innumerable copy titles such as ''The Ethnic Almanac'', ''The Jewish Almanac'', ''The Book Of TV Lists'', ''The Book Of Sex Lists'', etc.

Wallechinsky was taken to the Rome Olympic Games in 1960 by his father&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/olympics/2006/writers/02/17/olympic.blog.7/index.html |title=SI.com - 2006 Winter Olympics - Richard Deitsch: Wallechinsky's tome is everywhere - Friday February 17, 2006 12:39PM |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date= February 17, 2006|accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a seed was germinated that later resulted in the seminal ''The Complete Book of the Olympics'', a reference work that contained full results and many anecdotes about the modern Games. The book became unwieldy so was later split into two volumes ''The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics'' and ''The Complete Book of the Winter Olympics'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article683993.ece|title=Login|publisher=Entertainment.timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallechinsky now shares the editorial duties with his nephew Jaime Loucky (b. Los Angeles 26 February 1981). The books led to work for Wallechinsky as an Olympic commentator for [[NBC]].

In 1992 he was one of the founding members of the International Society of Olympic Historians (ISOH). He served as Treasurer of the ISOH from 1996 to 2004, Vice-President from 2004 to 2012 and is currently serving
a four-year term as the organization's President.

Wallechinsky is the founder of AllGov.com, which provides up-to-date news about more than 340 departments and agencies of the American government, most of which operate under the radar of the media, even when they have annual budgets of billions of dollars. AllGov tells you what each agency says it does, what it really does (in ''[[The People's Almanac]]'' Wallechinsky compiled a list of each country and had the topics "Who Rules?" and "Who REALLY Rules?"), and who is making a profit from the agency. It also gives a history of the agency, illuminates controversies relating to the agency and shares critiques and suggested reforms from both the left and the right.

He has compiled the list of "The World’s 10 Worst Dictators" for ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'' magazine for the last several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/china-struggles-to-fend-off-talk-of-nazis/75429/ |title=China Struggles to Fend Off Talk of Nazis - The New York Sun |publisher=Nysun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, this subject became a book entitled: ''Tyrants: The World’s 20 Worst Living Dictators''.

[[File:Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains (first half).JPG|thumb|350px|The first part of the ''Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains'', titled ''The Remaining Mountain'',  [[Zhejiang Provincial Museum]] in [[Hangzhou]]]]

'''''Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains''''' ({{zh|c=富春山居圖}}) is one of the few surviving works by the [[Chinese painting|painter]] [[Huang Gongwang]] (1269–1354) and it is considered to be among his greatest works. Painted between 1348 and 1350, the Chinese landscape painting was burnt into two pieces in 1650. Today, one piece is kept in the [[Zhejiang Provincial Museum]] in [[Hangzhou]], while the other piece is kept in the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]]. The entire painting combined would measure 691.3&amp;nbsp;cm in length.

==Huang Gongwang and Fuchun Mountains==
{{main|Huang Gongwang}}

''Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains'' is considered one of the greatest surviving masterpieces by the highly acclaimed [[Chinese painting|Chinese painter]] Huang Gongwang (1269–1354). He began serious studies in painting only at the age of 50. In 1347, he moved to the Fuchun Mountains (southwest of [[Hangzhou]], along the northern bank of the [[Fuchun River]]), where he spent the last years of his life. There he made a number of paintings on the natural landscape, among them ''Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains'', which depicting the scenery in [[Tonglu County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tlnews.com.cn/zt/2012/zgzmxc/content/2012-10/26/content_5140703.htm 桐庐与富春山居图]. &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beginnings===
It was "carefully designed and developed in layers of wet washes and brush strokes, giving a convincing appearance of off hand but inspired organisation and of spontaneous ink-play in detail"—two techniques with which [[Huang Gongwang]] is associated, later influencing such artists as [[Wang Yuanqi]], one of the 'Six Masters of the Early Qing'.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman E. Lee and Wai-Kam Ho. ''Chinese Art Under the Mongols: The Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368)''. Published by the Cleveland Museum of Art, 1968, po. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; He presented it to a [[Taoism|Taoist]] priest as a gift in 1350. A century later, the painting was somehow acquired by the [[Ming Dynasty]] [[Chinese painting|painter]] [[Shen Zhou]] (1427–1509). During the reign of the [[Chenghua Emperor]] (1465–1487), Shen Zhou sent the painting to an unnamed [[Chinese calligraphy|calligrapher]] to be inscribed (a curious point considering Shen Zhou was an excellent calligrapher himself). However, the son of this calligrapher seized the painting which, after a few changes of hands, reemerged on the market being sold at a high price. Unable to afford the price, there was nothing Shen Zhou could do except to make a copy of the painting himself. This imitation by Shen Zhou has become the most well-known and acclaimed copy among all others.

Not long after he made the copy, Shen Zhou gave it to a bureaucrat friend named Fan Shunju (樊舜举). Fan Shunju then began to search for the authentic copy. When he found it, he bought it at a hefty price and invited Shen Zhou to inscribe on it. Shen Zhou then noted down at the end of the scroll the story of how the painting was lost and found.

Over the following centuries, the painting had come to know several owners, including Tan Zhiyi (谈志伊), [[Dong Qichang]] (董其昌) and Wu Zhengzhi (吴正志). When Wu Zhengzhi died, he passed the painting to his third son Wu Hongyu (吴洪裕), who loved the painting so much that when he went on refuge, he left behind all valuables and only brought the painting and a copy of the ''[[Thousand Character Classic]]'' by Master Zhiyong (智永法师). In fact, he was so fond of these two pieces of work that he had them burnt shortly before he died, so that he could bring them to the afterlife.

===One into two===

Fortunately, Wu Hongyu's nephew Wu Jing'an rescued the painting, which was however already aflame and torn into two. The smaller piece, also the beginning section, measuring  51.4 centimeters long, was subsequently known as ''The Remaining Mountain'' (剩山圖). After passing through the hands of numerous collectors, it came to the possession of Wu Hufan (吴湖帆), painter and collector, during the 1940s. In 1956, it finally settled down in the [[Zhejiang Provincial Museum]] in [[Hangzhou]].

The journey of the latter longer section, measuring 636.9 centimeters long, known as ''The Master Wuyong Scroll'' (無用師卷), was perhaps more dramatic. It passed through the hands of several high-level government officials, including Gao Shiqi (高士奇) and Wang Hongxu (王鸿绪), before landing in the [[Forbidden City|Imperial Palace]]. Ironically, the [[Qianlong Emperor]], who prided himself in his connoisseurship, judged that this new acquisition was counterfeit and insisted that the imitation he already possessed was authentic. This mistake was only corrected in 1816, during the reign of the [[Jiaqing Emperor]]. The longer piece was taken to [[Taiwan]] during the 1950s and is now at the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]].

{{wide image|富春山居圖(無用師卷).jpg|5000px|The second section, ''The Master Wuyong Scroll'', currently kept in the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]]|dir=rtl}}

===Joined after three and half centuries===
In 2011, the first section of the painting was loaned to the National Palace Museum in Taipei where, in June and July, the two pieces were reunited for the first time since their separation more than three and a half centuries ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/05/13/2003503131 |title=Parts of treasured brush painting to finally be reunited |work=Taipei Times |publisher=Central News Agency |date=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition attracted 847,509 visitors and became one of the most popular art show in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/attfig/attfig11.pdf |title=Exhibition &amp; museum attendance figures 2011 |publisher=The Art Newspaper |date=April 2012 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
*A number of private [[condominium]]s in China are named Fuchun Mountains Residence after the painting.

==In popular culture==
In 2013's Chinese film ''[[Switch (2013 film)|Switch]]'', the hero ([[Andy Lau]]) is tasked to recover the stolen painting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5785">The so-called "'''For Delayed Birth'''" is an [[Old English]] [[Anglo-Saxon metrical charms|poetic medical text]] found in the manuscript London, British Library, [[Harleian Library|Harley]] 585, ff. 185r-v, in a collection of medical texts known since the nineteenth century as ''[[Lacnunga]]'' (‘remedies’). The manuscript was probably copied in the early eleventh century, though its sources may have been older.

The text is in fact a set of prose instructions which include a series of short poems which should be recited as part of one or more rituals. The text is an important witness to non-orthodox Anglo-Saxon Christian religious practice and to women's history:&lt;ref&gt;L. M. C. Weston, 'Women's Medicine, Women's Magic: The Old English Metrical Childbirth Charms', ''Modern Philology'', 92 (1995), 279-93, https://www.jstor.org/stable/438781.&lt;/ref&gt; it is unique among Anglo-Saxon medical texts for being explicitly for use and recitation by a woman.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Nelson, 'A Woman's Charm', ''Studia Neophilologica'', 57 (1985), 3-8 (at p. 3); https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00393278508587899.&lt;/ref&gt; However, 'this charm is perhaps misnamed, because it deals, not with delayed birth as such, but with the inability of the ''wifman'' [woman] for whom it is written to conceive at all, or to bring a child to term without miscarriage.'&lt;ref&gt;Keefer, Sarah Larratt (1990) A Monastic Echo in an Old English Charm. Leeds Studies in English, n.s. 2. pp. 71-80; http://digital.library.leeds.ac.uk/id/eprint/289.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==

As edited by [[Elliott Van Kirk Dobbie]] but with long vowels marked with acute accents, the text runs:&lt;ref&gt;The Anglo-Saxon Minor Poems, ed. by Elliott Van Kirk Dobbie, The Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records: A Collective Edition, 6 (New York: Columbia University Press, 1942), pp. 123-24&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verse translation|

Let that woman who cannot nourish her child walk to the grave of a departed person and then step three times over the burial, and then say these words three times:
{{pad|2em}}this as my remedy for the hateful late birth, 
{{pad|2em}}this as my remedy for the oppressive heavy birth,
{{pad|2em}}this as my remedy for the hateful lame birth.

And when that woman is with child and she goes to bed beside her husband, then she should say:

And when that mother perceives that the child is alive, she must then walk to church and when she comes before the altar, she should then say:

Let that woman who cannot nourish her child take in person part of her own child's grave, then wrap it in black wool, and sell it to merchants, and then say:
{{pad|2em}}May I trade it, may you trade it,
{{pad|2em}}this black wool and this seed of grief.

Let that woman who cannot nourish her child then take the milk of a cow of one colour in her hands and then drink it with her mouth, and then walk to running water, and spit the milk into it, and then ladle a mouthful of that water with that same hand, and swallow it all. She should then say these words:
{{pad|2em}}Wherever I transported the noble powerful-bellied stomach
{{pad|2em}}with this noble powerful-bellied food; 
{{pad|2em}}then I wish to have myself and to go home. 
Then she must walk to that brook when no-one can see her, nor [see her] when she returns from there, and then she must go into another house than the one she departed from and bury the food there.

'''Her Majesty's New Zealand Ship''' (HMNZS) is the [[ship prefix]] used to identify warships and shore facilities commissioned into the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] (RNZN).

It derives from "[[Her Majesty's Ship]]" (HMS) used in the [[United Kingdom]]. The British monarch is also equally and separately the [[Monarchy in New Zealand|New Zealand head of state]]. Should the Queen be replaced by a King, the designation also changes to "His" rather than "Her" Majesty. 

On 1 October 1941, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] fixed his signature to the approval for the Royal New Zealand Navy and from that date all ships officially received the designation.

{{Islamic prophets|Prophets in the Quran}}
{{Islam}}
'''ʾIdrīs ''' ({{lang-ar|إدريس}}) is an ancient [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]] and [[patriarch]] mentioned in the [[Qur'an]], whom Muslims believe was the second prophet after [[Adam]].&lt;ref&gt;Kīsāʾī, ''Qiṣaṣ'', i, 81-5&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic tradition has unanimously identified Idris with the [[biblical]] [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]],&lt;ref&gt;Erder, Yoram, “Idrīs”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān'', General Editor: Jane Dammen McAuliffe, Georgetown University, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. S. Alexander, "Jewish tradition in early Islam: The case of Enoch/Idrīs," in G. R. Hawting, J. A. Mojaddedi and A. Samely (eds.), ''Studies in Islamic and Middle Eastern texts and traditions in memory of Norman Calder'' ( jss Supp. 12), Oxford 2000, 11-29&lt;/ref&gt; although many Muslim scholars of the [[Classical antiquity|classical]] and [[medieval]] periods also held that Idris and [[Hermes Trismegistus]] were the same person.&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Albright, Review of Th. Boylan, ''The hermes of Egypt'', in ''Journal of the Palestine Oriental Society'' 2 (1922), 190-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. T. Halman, "Idris," in ''Holy People of the World: A Cross-Cultural Encyclopedia'' (ABC-CLIO, 2004), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

He is described in the Qur'an as "trustworthy" and "patient"&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an 19:56-57 and Qur'an 21:85-86&lt;/ref&gt; and the Qur'an also says that he was "exalted to a high station".&lt;ref name="cite quran|19|56|e=57|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|19|56|e=57|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', "Idris", Juan Eduardo Campo, Infobase Publishing, 2009, pg. 344&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this and other parallels, traditionally Idris has been identified with the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]],&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', Juan Eduardo Campo, Infobase Publishing, 2009, pg. 559&lt;/ref&gt; and Islamic tradition usually places Idris in the early [[Generations of Adam]], and considers him one of the oldest prophets mentioned in the Qur'an, placing him between [[Adam]] and [[Noah]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', Juan Eduardo Campo, Infobase Publishing, 2009, pg. 344: (His translation made him) "Islamic tradition places him sometime between Adam and Noah."&lt;/ref&gt; Idris' unique status&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', Juan Eduardo Campo, Infobase Publishing, 2009, pg. 344: (His translation made him) "a unique human being."&lt;/ref&gt; inspired many future traditions and stories surrounding him in [[Islamic]] [[Folklore|lore]].

According to ''[[hadith]]'', narrated by [[Malik ibn Anas]] and found in ''[[Sahih Muslim]]'', it is said that on [[Muhammad]]'s [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]], he encountered Idris in the fourth [[heaven]].&lt;ref name="muslim"&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1|309}}, {{Hadith-usc|muslim|1|314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditions that have developed around the figure of Idris have given him the scope of a prophet as well as a [[philosopher]] and [[mysticism|mystic]],&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, ''Historical Dictionary of the Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', ''Idris'', pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; and many later [[Muslim]] [[mysticism|mystics]], or [[Sufi]]s, including [[Ruzbihan Baqli]] and [[Ibn Arabi]], also mentioned having encountered Idris in their spiritual visions.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', Juan Eduardo Campo, Infobase Publishing, 2009, pg. 345"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The name "Idris", {{lang|ar|إدريس}}, has been described as perhaps having the origin of meaning "interpreter."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', Infobase Publishing, 2009, pg. 344: "It probably originated as a term in ancient Hebrew for "interpreter"..."&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Islam holds the prophet as having functioned an interpretive and mystical role and therefore this meaning garnered a general acceptance. Later Muslim sources, those of the eighth century, began to hold that Idris had two names, "Idris" and "Enoch," and other sources even stated that "Idris' true name is Enoch and that he is called Idris in [[Arabic]] because of his devotion to the study of the sacred books of his ancestors [[Adam]] and [[Seth]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', Juan Eduardo Campo, Infobase Publishing, 2009, pg. 344&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, these later sources also highlighted Idris as either meaning "interpreter" or having some meaning close to that of an interpretive role. Several of the classical commentators on the Qur'an, such as [[tafsir|Al-Baizawi]], said he was "called ''Idris'' from the Arabic ''dars'', meaning "to instruct," from his knowledge of [[divine]] [[Sacred mysteries|mysteries]]."&lt;ref name="Islam, T.P. Hughes 1989, pg. 192"&gt;''A Dictionary of Islam'', T.P. Hughes, Ashraf Printing Press, repr. 1989, pg. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Idris's father was Yarid (Arabic يريد) and his mother was Barkanah. Idris's wife was a woman named Aadanah. Idris also had a son whose name was [[Methuselah]]; who would eventually be the grandfather of [[Noah in Islam|Prophet Nuh]] (Noah). This means that Idris was the great-grandfather of Noah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qureshifamily.info/biography.aspx?q=8|title=Hazrat Idrees / Enoch (علیہ السلام) - Biography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qur'an==
Idris is mentioned twice in the Qur'an, where he is described as a wise man. In [[sura|chapter]] 19 of the Qur'an, God says: 
{{Quote|Also mention in the Book the case of Idris: He was a man of truth (and sincerity), (and) a prophet:&lt;br&gt;And We raised him to a lofty station.|Qur'an, Chapter 19 ([[Maryam (sura)|Mary]]), [[ayah|verses]] 56-57&lt;ref name="cite quran|19|56|e=57|s=ns"/&gt;}}

Later, in [[sura|chapter]] 21, Idris is again praised: 
{{Quote|And (remember) [[Ishmael in Islam|Isma'il]], Idris, and [[Dhul-Kifl]],&lt;ref&gt;See [[Ezekiel]]&lt;/ref&gt; all (men) of constancy and patience;&lt;br&gt;We admitted them to Our mercy: for they were of the righteous ones.|Qur'an, Chapter 21 ([[Al-Anbiya|Prophets]]), [[ayah|verses]] 85-86&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|21|85|e=86|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Life and Prophethood==
Idris was born in [[Babylon]], a city in present-day [[Iraq]]. Before he received the Revelation, he followed the rules revealed to Prophet [[Seth]], the son of Adam. When Idris grew older, Allah bestowed Prophethood on him. During his lifetime all the people were Muslim; no one associated partners with Allah. Afterwards, Idris left his hometown of Babylon because a great number of his people committed many sins even after he told them not to do so. Some of the Muslims left with Idris. It was hard for them to leave their home.

They asked Prophet Idris: "If we leave Babylon, where will we find a place like it?" Prophet Idris said: "If we immigrate for the sake of Allah, He will provide for us." So the people went with Prophet Idris and they reached the land of Egypt. They saw the [[Nile River]]. Idris stood at its bank and mentioned Allah, the Exalted, by saying: "Subhanallah."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alsunna.org/Islamic-History-of-the-Prophets-of-God-aalanbyaaa.html#gsc.tab=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muslim literature==
Islamic literature narrates that Idris was made prophet at around 40, which parallels the age when [[Muhammad]] began to prophesy, and lived during a time when people had begun to worship fire.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Lives of the Prophets'', Leila Azzam&lt;/ref&gt; Exegesis embellishes upon the lifetime of Idris, and states that the prophet divided his time into two. For three days of the week, Idris would preach to his people and four days he would devote solely to the worship of [[God]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many early commentators, such as [[Tabari]],&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Prophets and Kings'', Tabari, Volume I: ''Prophets and Patriarchs''&lt;/ref&gt; credited Idris with possessing great [[wisdom]] and [[knowledge]]. 

Exegesis narrates that Idris was among "the first men to use the pen as well as being one of the first men to observe the movement of the stars and set out scientific weights and measures."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These attributes remain consistent with the identification of [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] with Idris, as these attributes make it clear that Idris would have most probably lived during the [[Generations of Adam]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the same era during which Enoch lived. [[Ibn Arabi]] described Idris as the "prophet of the philosophers" and a number of works were attributed to him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', G. Vajda, ''Idris''&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars wrote commentaries on these supposed works,&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Sabi'n is said to have written on one of Idris's works cf. Hajiji Khalifa, iii, 599, no. 7010&lt;/ref&gt; all while Idris was also credited with several inventions, including the art of making garments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The commentator [[Ibn Ishaq]] narrated that he was the first man to write with a pen and that he was born when Adam still had 308 years of his life to live. In his commentary on the Quranic verses 19:56-57, the commentator [[Ibn Kathir]] narrated "During the Night Journey, the Prophet passed by him in fourth heaven. In a hadith, [[Ibn Abbas]] asked Ka’b what was meant by the part of the verse which says, ”And We raised him to a high station.” Ka’b explained: Allah revealed to Idris: ‘I would raise for you every day the same amount of the deeds of all Adam’s children’ – perhaps meaning of his time only. So Idris wanted to increase his deeds and devotion. A friend of his from the angels visited and Idris said to him: ‘Allah has revealed to me such and such, so could you please speak to the angel of death, so I could increase my deeds.’ The angel carried him on his wings and went up into the heavens. When they reached the fourth heaven, they met the angel of death, who was descending down towards earth. The angel spoke to him, about what Idris had spoken to him before. The angel of death said: ‘But where is Idris?’ He replied, ‘He is upon my back.’ The angel of death said: ‘How astonishing! I was sent and told to seize his soul in the fourth heaven. I kept thinking how I could seize it in the fourth heaven when he was on the earth?’ Then he took his soul out of his body, and that is what is meant by the verse: ‘And We raised him to a high station.’&lt;ref&gt;Tafsir Ibn Kathir; commentary 19:56-57&lt;/ref&gt;

Early accounts of Idris' life attributed "thirty portions of revealed scripture" to him.&lt;ref name="Islam, T.P. Hughes 1989, pg. 192"/&gt; Therefore, Idris was understood by many early commentators to be both a prophet as well as a [[Courier|messenger]]. Several modern commentators have linked this sentiment with [[Biblical apocrypha]] such as the [[Book of Enoch]] and the [[Second Book of Enoch]].&lt;ref name="Islam, T.P. Hughes 1989, pg. 192"/&gt;

==Identification==
===Enoch===
[[File:MHS Eliasz i Enoch XVII w p.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Elijah in Islam|Elijah]] and [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]]'' - seventeenth-century icon, Historic Museum in Sanok, Poland]]
Idris is generally accepted to be the same as [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]]. Many of the early Qur'anic commentators, such as [[Tabari]] and [[Qur'an|Al-Baizawi]] identified Idris with Enoch. Al-Baizawi said: "Idris was of the posterity of Seth and a forefather of Noah, and his name was Enoch (ar. ''Uhnukh'')"&lt;ref name="Islam, T.P. Hughes 1989, pg. 192"/&gt;
Classical commentators used to popularly identify Idris with [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], the [[patriarch]] who lived in the [[Generations of Adam]]. An example is [[İsmail Hakkı Bursevî]]'s commentary on ''Fusus al-hikam'' by Muhyiddin ibn ʻArabi.&lt;ref&gt;Zaid H. Assfy ''Islam and Christianity: connections and contrasts, together with the stories of the prophets and imams'' Sessions, 1977 p122&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars, however, do not concur with this identification because they argue that it lacks definitive proof. As Qur'anic translator [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] says in note 2508 of his translation:
{{quote|Idris is mentioned twice in the Quran, viz., here and in Chapter 21, verse 85, where he is mentioned as among those who patiently persevered. His identification with the Biblical Enoch, may or may not be correct. Nor are we justified in interpreting verse 57 here as meaning the same thing as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], v.24 ("God took him"), that he was taken up without passing through the portals of death. All we are told is he was a man of truth and sincerity, and a prophet, and that he had a high position among his people.|Abdullah Yusuf Ali|''[[The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary]]''&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''[[The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary]]'' C2508. Idris is mentioned twice in the Quran, viz.; here and in 21:85, where he is mentioned among those who patiently persevered. His identification with the Biblical Enoch, who "'walked with God' (Gen. 5:21-24), may or may not be correct. Nor are we justified in interpreting verse 57 here as meaning the same thing as in Gen. 5:24 ("God took him"), that he was taken up without passing through the portals of death. All we are told is that he was a man of truth and sincerity, and a prophet, and that he had a high position among his people. It is this point which brings him in the series of men just mentioned; he kept himself in touch with his people, and was honoured among them. Spiritual progress need not cut us off from our people, for we have to help and guide them. He kept to truth and piety in the highest station.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Hermes Trismegistus===

[[Sayyid Ahmed Amiruddin]] has pointed out that [[Hermes Trismegistus]] is the builder of the [[Pyramids of Giza]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sayyidamiruddin.com/2013/01/02/the-tombs-of-prophets-seth-and-idris-the-great-pyramids-of-giza/|title=The Tombs of Prophets Seth and Idris: The Great Pyramids of Giza|date=2013-01-02|work=Sayyid Amiruddin|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a major place in [[Islam]]ic tradition. He writes, "Hermes Trismegistus is mentioned in the [[Quran]] in verse [[Maryam (surah)|19]]:56-57:{{'}}''Mention, in the Book, Idris, that he was truthful, a prophet. We took him up to a high place''{{' "}}. The Jabirian corpus contains the oldest documented source for the [[Emerald Tablet]] of Hermes Trismegistus, translated by [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber) for the [[Hashemite]] [[Caliph]] of [[Baghdad]] [[Harun al-Rashid]] the [[Abbasid]]. [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]], a [[Shiite]], identified as Jābir al-[[Sufi]], was a student of [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], [[Husayn ibn 'Ali]]'s great grandson. Thus, for the [[Abbasid]]'s and the [[Alid]]'s, the writings of Hermes Trismegistus were considered sacred, as an inheritance from the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] and the [[Prophets]]. These writings were recorded by the [[Ikhwan al-Safa]], and subsequently translated from [[Arabic]] into [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Hebrew]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[English language|English]]. In these writings, Hermes Trismegistus is identified as Idris, the infallible Prophet who traveled to outer space from [[Egypt]], and to heaven, whence he brought back a cache of objects from the Eden of [[Adam]] and the [[Black Stone]] from where he landed on earth in [[India]].&lt;ref name="Quran p.46"&gt;Prophets in the Quran: An Introduction to the Quran and Muslim Exegesis, p.46. Wheeler, Brannon. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ancient Arab genealogists, the [[Prophet Muhammad]], who is also believed to have traveled to the heavens on the night of [[Isra and Mi'raj]], is a direct descendant of Hermes Trismegistus. [[Ibn Kathir]] said, "As for Idris...He is in the genealogical chain of the Prophet Muhammad, except according to one genealogist...Ibn Ishaq says he was the first who wrote with the Pen. There was a span of 380 years between him and the life of Adam. Many of the scholars allege that he was the first to speak about this, and they call him Thrice-Great Hermes [Hermes Trismegistus]".&lt;ref name="Quran p.46" /&gt; [[Ahmad al-Buni]] considered himself a follower of the hermetic teachings; and his contemporary [[Ibn Arabi]] mentioned Hermes Trismegistus in his writings. The Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya of [[Ibn Arabi]] speaks of Hermes's travels to "vast cities (outside earth), possessing technologies far superior then ours"&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Ahmad. Dajjal, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; and meeting with the [[Twelfth Imam]], the Ninth (generation) from the Third ([[al-Husayn]] the third Imam), who also ascended to the heavens, and is still alive like his ancestor Hermes Trismegistus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ahmedamiruddin.wordpress.com/ |title=Sayyid A. Amiruddin &amp;#124; An Authorized Khalifah of H.E Mawlana Shaykh Nazim Adil al-Haqqani |publisher=Ahmedamiruddin.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A late Arabic writer wrote of the [[Sabaeans]] that their religion had a sect of star worshipers who held their doctrine to come from Hermes Trismegistus through the prophet Adimun.&lt;ref name=stapleton&gt;{{cite book |title= Chemistry in Iraq and Persia in the Tenth Century AD: Memoirs of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Volume 8 |last=Stapleton |first=H.E.|date=1927 |author2= R.F. Azo |author3=M.H. Husein |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bengal |location=Calcutta| pages=398–403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antoine Faivre]], in ''[[The Eternal Hermes]]'' (1995), has pointed out that Hermes Trismegistus has a place in the [[Islam]]ic tradition, although the name ''[[Hermes]]'' does not appear in the ''Qur'an''. [[Hagiographer]]s and chroniclers of the first centuries of the Islamic [[Hijra (Islam)|Hegira]] quickly identified Hermes Trismegistus with Idris,&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Van Bladel, ''The Arabic Hermes. From pagan sage to prophet of science'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 168 "Abu Mas'har’s biography of Hermes, written approximately between 840 and 860, would establish it as common knowledge."&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Prophets of Islam|nabi]]'' of [[sura]]hs 19.57 and 21.85,  whom the ''[[Arabs]]'' also identified with [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] (cf. Genesis 5.18–24). Idris/Hermes was termed "Thrice-Wise" Hermes Trismegistus because he had a threefold origin. The first Hermes, comparable to [[Thoth]], was a "civilizing hero", an initiator into the mysteries of the divine science and wisdom that animate the world; he carved the principles of this sacred science in [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphs]]. The second Hermes, in [[Babylon]], was the initiator of [[Pythagoras]]. The third Hermes was the first teacher of [[alchemy]]. "A faceless prophet," writes the Islamicist [[Pierre Lory]], "Hermes possesses no concrete or salient characteristics, differing in this regard from most of the major figures of the Bible and the Quran."&lt;ref&gt;(Faivre 1995 pp. 19–20)&lt;/ref&gt; A common interpretation of the representation of "Trismegistus" as "thrice great" recalls the three characterizations of Idris: as a messenger of god, or a prophet; as a source of wisdom, or ''hikmet'' (wisdom from ''hokmah''); and as a king of the world order, or a "sultanate". These are referred to as ''müselles bin ni'me''.

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], wrote in one of his tablets: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The first person who devoted himself to philosophy was Idris.  Thus was he named.  Some called him also [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermes]].  In every tongue he hath a special name.  He it is who hath set forth in every branch of philosophy thorough and convincing statements.  After him [[Apollonius_of_Tyana|Balínús]] derived his knowledge and sciences from the Hermetic Tablets and most of the philosophers who followed him made their philosophical and scientific discoveries from his words and statements...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other identifications===
Due to the linguistic dissimilarities of the name "Idris" with the aforementioned figures, several historians have proposed that this [[Qur'anic]] figure is derived from "Andreas", the immortality-achieving cook from the Syriac [[Alexander romance]].&lt;ref&gt;Çakmak, Çenap. Islam: A World Encyclopedia, Vol. 1: A-E. 2017. p 674-675.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, John Porter. The Darvishes: Or Oriental Spiritualism. Edited by H. A. Rose. 1968. p 174, footnote 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brinner, William M. The History of Al-Tabari, Vol. III. Edited by Ehsan Yar-Shater. 1991. p 415, footnote 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, historian Patricia Crone proposes that both "Idris" and "Andreas" are derived from the [[Akkadian literature|Akkadian]] [[epic (genre)|epic]] of [[Atra-Hasis]].&lt;ref&gt;Crone, Patricia. Islam, the Near East, and Varieties of Godlessness: Collected Studies in Three Volumes, Vol. III. Edited by Hanna Siurua. 2016. p 49-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Faggart'''&lt;ref name=SLAMobit/&gt; (June 26, 1930 &amp;ndash; June 24, 2013)&lt;ref name=SLAMobit/&gt; was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], better known by his [[ring name]] '''Jackie Fargo'''.&lt;ref name=SLAMobit/&gt;  He competed in Southeastern regional promotions and the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. A mainstay of [[NWA Mid-America]] (later the [[Continental Wrestling Association]]), he served as a mentor to [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry "The King" Lawler]] and [[The Fabulous Ones]], among other wrestlers in the Memphis area. He was known for his blonde hair and "Fargo Strut" mannerism, and held 45 tag team championships during his career, with [[Don Fargo]], Sonny "Roughhouse" Fargo, amongst others.

==Professional wrestling career==

The '''''Liber Eliensis'''''{{efn|Sometimes '''''Historia Eliensis'''''&lt;ref name=Introxiii&gt;Fairweather "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''Book of Ely'''''}} is a 12th-century English chronicle and history, written in [[medieval Latin|Latin]]. Composed in three books, it was written at [[Ely Abbey]] on the island of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] in the [[The Fens|fenland]]s of eastern [[Cambridgeshire]]. Ely Abbey became the [[Ely Cathedral|cathedral]] of a newly formed [[Diocese of Ely|bishopric]] in 1109. Traditionally the author of the anonymous work has been given as Richard or Thomas, two monks at Ely, one of whom, Richard, has been identified with an official of the monastery, but some historians hold that neither Richard nor Thomas was the author.

The ''Liber'' covers the period from the founding of the abbey in 673 until the middle of the 12th century, building on earlier historical works. It incorporates documents and stories of [[hagiography|saints' lives]]. The work typifies a type of local history produced during the latter part of the 12th century. Similar books were written at other English monasteries. The longest of the contemporary local histories, the ''Liber'' chronicles the devastation that [[the Anarchy]] caused during the reign of King [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen]]. It also documents the career of [[Nigel of Ely|Nigel]], the [[Bishop of Ely]] from 1133 to 1169, and his disputes with King Stephen. Other themes include the miracles worked by the monastery's patron saint, [[Æthelthryth]], and gifts of land to Ely.

Two complete manuscripts survive, complemented by partial manuscripts. The Latin text was published in 1962, and an English translation followed in 2005. Extracts had appeared in print earlier.

The ''Liber Eliensis'' provides an important history of the region and period it covers, and particularly for the abbey and bishopric of Ely.

==Background and authorship==
[[File:Ely Cathedral by John Buckler.JPG|right|thumb|Early 19th-century print of [[Ely Cathedral]], where the ''Liber Eliensis'' was produced]]

The ''Liber Eliensis'' was written at Ely Abbey, which became [[Ely Cathedral]] upon conversion into a bishopric in 1109.&lt;ref name=Stafford20&gt;Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stafford180&gt;Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' pp. 180–181&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Elisabeth van Houts believes that it was written in two stages: first under Bishop [[Hervey le Breton]], in office from 1109 to 1133; and continued under Bishop [[Geoffrey Ridel (bishop of Ely)|Geoffrey Ridel]], who served from 1173 to 1189. For van Houts, the first stage was the translation of an [[Old English]] work into Latin, commissioned by Bishop Hervey. The rest of the work, van Houts argues, was composed in the 1170s.&lt;ref name=Houts110&gt;van Houts "Historical Writing" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; However, E. O. Blake, who edited the first Latin printing of the work, concludes that the ''Liber'' was probably composed in three parts, based on its contents; the first book of the ''Liber'' was begun after 1131, when one of the sources used in the ''Liber'' was completed. The second has a preface apologising for the delay in its completion, and could not have been started before 1154, as it records events from that year. The third and final book was completed between 1169, when Bishop Nigel died and whose death is mentioned in the book, and 1174, when a new bishop was appointed. As there is no mention of Nigel's replacement, Blake states that this suggests that book three was finished before the new bishop took office.&lt;ref name=Blakexlvi&gt;Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xlvi–xlix&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally the work was ascribed to either Thomas or Richard, two monks of Ely mentioned in the text.&lt;ref name=Introxvii&gt;Fairweather "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Antonia Gransden]] is inclined to believe that the work is by Richard, who is usually identified with the Richard who was recorded as sub-prior and [[prior]] of Ely, holding the latter office from 1177 until some time between 1189 and 1194.&lt;ref name=Gransden271&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Blake thinks that Richard was the author, but he considers the evidence to be inconclusive.&lt;ref name=Blakexlvi/&gt; Janet Fairweather, a [[classicist]] and a recent translator of the ''Liber'', suggests that it may have been written by someone other than the traditional candidates.&lt;ref name=Introxvii/&gt; Whoever the author, the ''Liber'' specifically states that it was written at the bidding of some members of the monastic community at Ely.&lt;ref name=Gransden272&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Liber'' is one of a number of monastic histories written during the middle and later 12th century, when a number of monasteries in northern and southern England produced works devoted to recording the histories of their religious houses and local areas. In the south, these included the ''[[Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis]]'' of [[Abingdon Abbey]], the ''[[Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis]]'' of [[Ramsey Abbey]], the ''[[Chronicon Angliae Petriburgense]]'' of [[Peterborough Abbey]], a history of the [[Episcopal see|see]] of [[Diocese of Bath and Wells|Bath and Wells]], and the ''[[Chronicon Monasterii de Bello]]'' of [[Battle Abbey]]. The northern histories record the [[foundation stories]] of the various [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] houses in the north, along with other information relating to those houses. Those from the south, including the ''Liber Eliensis'', mainly concern themselves with the various controversies involving their respective religious houses. The northern histories are less concerned with controversy, and overall are more prone to [[hagiography]].&lt;ref name=Gransden269&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' pp. 269–270&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==

To a large extent the work is composite; that is, it is a compilation borrowing from or at least using&lt;!--a difference?--&gt; earlier sources. These include the early medieval writer [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', a chronicle that was associated with Bede's ''[[De temporum ratione]]'', the ''[[Chronicon ex chronicis]]'', and [[William of Poitiers]]' ''Gesta Guillelmi II ducis Normannorum''. Lesser-used sources include the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', [[Orderic Vitalis]]' ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Stephen of Ripon's ''[[Vita Sancti Wilfrithi]]'', [[William of Malmesbury]]'s ''[[Gesta pontificum Anglorum]]'', a list of the [[King of Wessex|kings of Wessex]], the Old English poem ''[[The Battle of Maldon]]'', and a number of saints' lives, including some written by [[Eadmer]], Felix, [[Abbo of Fleury]], [[Goscelin]], and [[Osbern of Canterbury]].&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxviii&gt;Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xxviii–xxix&lt;/ref&gt; The work on Maldon was included because the hero of the work was [[Byrhtnoth]], a patron of the monastery.&lt;ref name=Gransden274&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Works more directly related to Ely were also used. The primary one of these works was Bishop [[Æthelwold of Winchester]]'s ''Libellus'', large parts of which were copied into the ''Liber Eliensis''.&lt;ref name=Stafford16&gt;Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Also incorporated into the ''Liber'' was an earlier ''Vita'', or saints' life, on Æthelthryth, the founder and first abbess of Ely.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxx&gt;Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xxx–xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; A work on the benefactors of the abbey was also used,&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxxviii&gt;Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xxxviii&lt;/ref&gt; and the material from three surviving [[cartulary|cartularies]].&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxxix&gt;Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; These documents were translated from their original Old English into Latin by the compiler.&lt;ref name=Gransden274/&gt; Another source, as related in the ''Liber'' itself, was a work about [[Hereward the Wake]] written by a brother monk known as Richard. Modern historians have identified it with the ''[[Gesta Herwardi]]'' known from a 13th-century manuscript. It is, however, unclear whether the compiler of the ''Liber'' used the exact text of the ''Gesta'' as it has come down to us, or a different, earlier manuscript.&lt;ref name=Houts202&gt;van Houts "Hereward and Flanders" ''Anglo-Saxon England 28'' pp. 202–204&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these sources may originally have been oral works. A number of the stories in the narrative parts of the ''Liber'' resemble Scandinavian sagas, including the story about King [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] visiting the monastery and singing an Anglo-Saxon song to the assembled monks. It is possible that the information on Hereward and Byrhtnoth originally came from orally transmitted tales that were written down.&lt;ref name=Gransden275&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is traditionally divided into three books. Along with the history in Book I the first section also contains a prologue and a preface. It discusses the founding of the Abbey of Ely and the background of the foundress, Æthelthryth. The first book also deals with the history of the abbey and its abbesses until the Danish invasions of the 9th century. A description of the destruction of the abbey by the Danes and of King [[Edgar the Peaceable|Edgar's]] (reigned 959–975) rule concludes the book.&lt;ref name=LE9&gt;Fairweather (ed.) ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt; The second book, Book II, begins with the restoration of the abbey during Edgar's reign, under Bishop Æthelwold. Accounts of the subsequent abbots until the last, Richard, are included in Book II, as well as numerous charters and other documents.&lt;ref name=LE85&gt;Fairweather (ed.) ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. 85–95&lt;/ref&gt; The final book, Book III, contains information on the conversion of the abbey to a bishopric, and on the first few bishops; it concludes with a description of the martyrdom of [[Thomas Becket]]. Interspersed with the historical narrative are a number of documents and charters relating to the bishops.&lt;ref name=LE286&gt;Fairweather (ed.) ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. 286–296&lt;/ref&gt;

The work also depicts the devastation that [[the Anarchy]] caused during King [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen's]] reign. The chronicler states that failure of the harvest and pillaging caused a [[famine]]. The work describes the area around the abbey for {{convert|20|–|30|mi|km|abbr=off}} as being filled with unburied corpses, and that the price of a bushel of grain rose to 200&amp;nbsp;[[penny (English coin)|pence]]. The long descriptions of Nigel of Ely's disputes with King Stephen lead to a discussion of the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|Battle of Lincoln]] and other matters not directly related to Ely. The ''Liber'' gives a detailed account of Nigel's career, although in general the chronicle's author favours Stephen over his own bishop. The ascension of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] to the English throne is considered to be an excellent event, and the ''Liber'' praises the new king.&lt;ref name=Gransden280&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' pp. 280–281&lt;/ref&gt;

An important part of the work was devoted to the miracles and glorification of Ely's patroness, Saint Æthelthryth. The very beginning of the work incorporates an earlier ''Vita'', or ''Life'', of Æthelthryth, which resembles the ''Vitae'' of other saints written by Goscelin in the 11th century; Goscelin is known to have visited Ely.&lt;ref name=Gransden282&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; The work may have helped to increase the number of pilgrims visiting Ely, as well as enabling the monks to better explain the history of earlier donations to the abbey. Many of the gifts to the abbey church are described, such as the altar cloth donated by Queen Emma (died 1052), wife of both King [[Æthelred the Unready|Æthelred II]] (died 1016) and King Cnut (died 1035), with a short history of the circumstances of the gift.&lt;ref name=Gransden284&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt; The miracle stories frequently say that those who wished cures or miracles similar to those in the ''Liber'' would need to come to the monastery, where they could make a donation.&lt;ref name=Pax124&gt;Paxton "Textual Communities" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XXVI'' p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Jennifer Paxton argues that increasing pilgrimage to the monastery was one of the main goals of the compilers of the ''Liber''.&lt;ref name=Pax128&gt;Paxton "Textual Communities" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XXVI'' p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern of the chronicle was the acquisition of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The ''Liber'' was used by the monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate.&lt;ref name=Gransden283&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' pp. 283–284&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various [[Bishop of Lincoln|Bishops of Lincoln]], which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.&lt;ref name=Gransden286&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

A third theme of the work is the stress on the importance and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The ''Liber'' stresses the burials of [[Athelstan (bishop)|Æthelstan]], a [[Bishop of Elmham]], that of [[Ælfwine of Elmham|Ælfwine]], another Bishop of Elmham, and [[Wulfstan II]], an [[Archbishop of York]].&lt;ref name=Pax132&gt;Paxton "Textual Communities" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XXVI'' pp. 132–134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Matthew Paris 02.jpg|right|thumb|The medieval chronicler, [[Matthew Paris]], shown here in a 13th-century manuscript depiction of his deathbed, used the ''Liber'' as a source for his works.]]

The ''Liber'' was familiar to the 13th-century chronicler [[Matthew Paris]], who used it along with the ''Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis'' of Ramsey Abbey in his own historical works. Another 13th-century English writer, [[Roger of Wendover]], was also aware of the ''Liber''.&lt;ref name=Gransden374&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 374 and footnote 147&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the information contained in the ''Liber'' is important to historians. It is in the ''Liber'' that the first statement that Æthelwold translated the ''[[Benedictine Rule]]'' into Old English is made.&lt;ref name=Gneuss73&gt;Gneuss "Origin of Standard Old English" ''Anglo-Saxon England 1'' pp. 73–74 and footnote 3&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Liber'' is the longest of the local histories produced in England during the 12th century,&lt;ref name=Gransden270/&gt; and it contains a description of the royal [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], which might be the earliest evidence for the existence of that office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The ''Liber'' describes how King Edgar (died 975) granted the abbey the office of [[chancellor]] (head of the chancery), but the authenticity of the passage is unclear.&lt;ref name=Gransden276&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of a formal chancery office in Anglo-Saxon England before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] is a matter of some debate amongst historians.&lt;ref name=Rankin&gt;Rankin "Chancery, Royal" ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England''&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Dorothy Whitelock]] says of the work that it is "unique among post-Conquest monastic histories".&lt;ref name=QTexts&gt;Quoted in Royal Historical Society ''Texts and Calendars II'' p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; It was written to help buttress the claims of Ely to a [[Liberty (division)|judicial liberty]],&lt;ref name=CamIntroxlix/&gt; or the exercise of all the royal rights within a [[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]].&lt;ref name=Warren46&gt;Warren ''Governance'' pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, the ''Liber'' collected together earlier sources used to help the abbey evade episcopal control, prior to the abbey becoming a bishopric. These documents may have been forged or had their contents doctored to help the abbey's cause. Because of the tendentious nature of the collection, the work is used by historians with great caution.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxlix&gt;Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xlix–l&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the untrustworthy nature of the ''Liber'' and the documents preserved therein, it remains a valuable source for the history of the time period it covers, as well as the internal history of the abbey and bishopric.&lt;ref name=CamIntroliii&gt;Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. liii–liv&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Antonia Gransden characterises the ''Liber'' as "valuable for general history", but qualifies by saying that "the whole lacks unity and has errors and confusing repetitions".&lt;ref name=Gransden270&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==

The work survives in two complete manuscripts (MS), that of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] MS O.2.1, usually known as the E manuscript; and one in the possession of Ely Cathedral Chapter, usually known as the F manuscript. The E manuscript dates from the late 12th century, and shows three different [[Hand (handwriting)|scribal hands]].{{efn|The manuscript is on [[vellum]] on 256 [[folio]]s in a single column with initials in green and red ink. Besides the ''Liber'', the manuscript also has 14 folios at the front which are unnumbered and consist of a [[Calendar of saints]] and a list of bishops and abbots of Ely. Then there follow the folios with the ''Liber'' itself, numbered 1-177. The last parts of the manuscript contains the ''[[Inquisitio Eliensis]]'' and short ''[[hagiography|vitae]]'' on the saints [[Ædelberga]], [[Ærcongota]], [[Ærmenilda]], [[Seaxburh of Ely|Sexburga]], [[Werburga]], and [[Wihtburh|Wihtburga]].&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxiii/&gt;}} The F manuscript dates to the early 13th century, with four scribal hands.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxiii&gt;Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xxiii–xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This manuscript is on vellum also and consists of 190 folios, numbered 1-188 as two folio numbers have been used twice. The text is in two columns with initial letters mainly in green and red with some in blue. The first folio is not part of the ''Liber'' and consists of notes on various subjects, including the [[Confessor of the Faith|confessor]]s buried at Ely and the rights of the convent on the [[Isle of Ely]]. Folios 2-188v are the ''Liber'' proper which is followed by a charter from around 1200 and a note from the 15th century.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxiii/&gt;}} The E manuscript was given to Trinity College as part of the Gale Collection by [[Roger Gale (antiquary)|Roger Gale]] in 1738.&lt;ref name=TrinityCatalog&gt;Staff "Liber Eliensis" ''Trinity Library Catalogue''&lt;/ref&gt; The F manuscript has remained at Ely since its creation, and is the only manuscript at Ely still remaining from the medieval monastic library.&lt;ref name=Library4&gt;Owen ''Library and Muniments of Ely Cathedral'' p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the two complete manuscripts, a number of other manuscripts contain parts of the whole work. [[British Library]] MS [[Cotton library|Cotton]] Titus A.i, usually known as the G&amp;nbsp;manuscript, has part of Book II, and dates from the late 12th or early 13th century. British Library MS Cotton Domitian A.xv, known as the B manuscript, dates from the late 13th or early 14th century and includes some other material along with Book I and the same parts of Book II as in manuscript G. Another Cottonian manuscript, British Library MS Cotton Vespasian A.xix, has parts of Book III, and dates to between 1257 and 1286.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxv&gt;Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt; This manuscript is usually known as the A manuscript.&lt;ref name=Introxxv&gt;Fairweather "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the various extant manuscripts is complex, and a definitive scheme of how the various manuscripts relate to each other cannot be made.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxlii&gt;Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xlii&lt;/ref&gt; Blake, in his edition of the ''Liber'', suggests that Book I once existed as a stand-alone work, which influenced the B manuscript. A separate Book II, with parts of Book III, was then written and combined with the stand-alone Book I, into either manuscript E or an earlier version of that manuscript. Book II was then revised, combined with parts of G, Book I, and parts of E to make manuscript F.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxlvi&gt;Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xlvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Related manuscripts include [[Bodleian Library]] Oxford MS Laud 647, known as the O manuscript.&lt;ref name=Introxxv/&gt;{{efn|This manuscript is also on vellum in 188 folios in double columned text. The initials alternate in red and blue ink and are elaborately decorated. The actual ''Liber'' takes up folios 3-177v in this manuscript.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxvi/&gt;}} This is based on the ''Liber'', but reorganised into a listing of the acts of the various abbots and bishops and dates from the 14th century. Blake, in his edition of the ''Liber'', calls that and related works the ''Chronicon Abbatum et Episcoporum Eliensium''.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxvi&gt;Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xxv–xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; Another related work is contained in Trinity College, Cambridge MS O.2.41, which contains the ''Libellus'' of Æthelwold and an Ely cartulary. Two other related works containing just cartularies are British Library [[Cotton MS Tiberius]] A vi and Cambridge University Library Ely Diocesan Register Liber M.&lt;ref name=Introxxv/&gt;

==Publication==

''Liber Eliensis'' has been published by the [[Royal Historical Society]] in its Camden Third Series, edited by E. O. Blake. The edition contains the Latin text along with some Old English texts, but no translation.&lt;ref name=Texts&gt;Royal Historical Society ''Texts and Calendars II'' p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Janet Fairweather has produced a recent English translation of the Latin, published in 2005 by the [[Boydell Press]].&lt;ref name=LE&gt;Fairweather (ed.) ''Liber Eliensis''&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, only sections of the ''Liber'' had appeared in print, without translations. Parts of the ''Liber'' were edited by D. J. Stewart and published by the [[Anglia Christiana Society]] in 1848.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxiii/&gt; Other extracts were published in various works, including parts of Book I that were included in Volume 2 of [[Jean Mabillon]]'s nine-volume ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]'', printed between 1688 and 1701.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxvii&gt;Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Biblio149&gt;Graves ''Bibliography of English History'' p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Another set of extracts, mainly consisting of parts of Book II, was compiled by Roger Gale's father [[Thomas Gale]], as part of his ''[[Historicae Britannicae Scriptores XV]]'', published at Oxford in 1691.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxvii/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biblio138&gt;Graves ''Bibliography of English History'' p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Gesamtverzeichnis'' (RISM Library Sigla. Complete Index), which appeared in 1999, has been available in a regularly updated version on the RISM website since 2006 and in a searchable database online since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;RISM Zentralredaktion, announcement [http://www.rism.info/en/home/newsarchive.html 29 November 2011] and Birgit Grün, "RISM Library Sigla," trans. Keith Harris, ''Forum Musikbibliothek'' 27 (2006/4), p. 331ff. Background information about the sigla&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="97662">'''Miguel Asín Palacios''' (1871–1944) was a Spanish scholar of [[Islamic studies]] and the [[Arabic language]], and a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]]. He is primarily known for suggesting [[Muslim]] sources for ideas and motifs present in [[Dante]]'s [[Divine Comedy]], which he discusses in his book ''La Escatología musulmana en la Divina Comedia'' (1919). He wrote on medieval Islam, extensively on [[al-Ghazali]] ([[Latin]]: Algazel). A major book ''El Islam cristianizado'' (1931) presents a study of [[Sufism]] through the works of [[Ibn Arabi|Muhyiddin ibn 'Arabi]] ([[Spanish language|Sp]]: Mohidín Abenarabe) of [[Murcia]] in Andalusia (medieval [[Al-Andalus]]). Asín also published other comparative articles regarding certain Islamic influences on Christianity and on [[Spanish mystics|mysticism in Spain]].

==Life==
Miguel Asín Palacios was born in [[Zaragoza]], [[Aragón]], on July 5, 1871, into the modest commercial family of Don Pablo Asín and Doña Filomena Palacios. His older brother Luis, his younger sister Dolores, and he were little children when their father died of pneumonia. His mother the young widow continued in business with help and made ends meet with decorum but not as well as before. He attended the Colegio de El Salvador instructed by [[Jesuits]] in Zaragoza, where he began to make lifelong friendships. He entered the Seminario Conciliar, singing his first [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] at San Cayetano in Zaragoza in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Emilio García Gómez, "Don Miguel Asín (1871-1944) Esquema de una biografía" in ''Al-Andalus'' 9: 266-291, 269 (1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[University of Zaragoza|Universidad de Zaragoza]] Asín had met and begun study under the Arabist Professor [[Julian Ribera y Tarrago|Julián Ribera y Tarragó]].&lt;ref&gt;Asín would later write the long introduction to the ''jubilación'' for Prof. Ribera, ''Disertaciones y Opúsculos'' (Madrid: Imprenta de Estanislao Maestre 1928), 2 volumes, at I: xv-cxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896 at Madrid he defended his thesis on the [[Persia]]n theologian [[Ghazali]] (1058–1111) before [[:es:Francisco Codera Zaidín|Francisco Codera Zaidín]] and [[Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo]].&lt;ref&gt;Emilio García Gómez, "Homenaje a Don Francisco Codera: 1836-1917" in ''Al Andalus'' at 15: 263-274 (1950).&lt;/ref&gt; All three professors guided his subsequent studies. Asín then developed his study of Al-Ghazali, and published it in 1901. He also wrote on [[Ibn 'Arabi|Mohidin Abenarabe]], who is often called the leading figure in [[Islamic mysticism]]. Thus Asín was running parallel with a then European-wide effort to [[Islamic studies by author (non-Muslim or academic)|understand Muslim]] inner spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;José Valdivia Válor, ''Don Miguel Asín Palacios. Mística cristiana y mística musulmana'' (Madrid: Ediciones Hiperión 1992) at 19-25, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James T. Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' (Leiden: Brill 1970) at 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Codera then retired from his chair in the Arabic Language at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|Universidad de Madrid]] in order to create room there for Asín; Ribera in Zaragoza allowed Asín to leave to assume this Madrid ''cátedra'' in 1903. Professor Asín lived in the same well-connected boarding house&lt;ref&gt;This boarding house was well known for its residents and visitors, past (e.g., Sanz del Rio) and current. The ''tertulia'' (discussion group) of [[Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo|Menéndez y Pelayo]] met there, as did a variety of politicians and their supporters, and the young Duque de Alba (hence Asín's ''entrée'' to royalty). Emilio García Gómez, "Don Miguel Asín" in ''Al-Andalus'' 9:266-291 at 274-275 (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; as Codera, and was well received in the university. By 1905 Professor Ribera had also come to Madrid; together with Asín they soon founded the journal ''Cultura Española'' (1906–1909). Asín attended international conferences in Algeria (1905) and Copenhagen (1908), where he engaged other [[Arabists]] and academics in [[Islamic studies]]. In Madrid he continued to prosper, eventually being admitted to the royal court where he gained the friendship of [[Alfonso XIII]].&lt;ref&gt;Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' at 175-178, 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valdivia Válor, ''Don Miguel Asín Palacios'' at 25-27, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Arabian nights manuscript.jpg|thumb]]

Asín, of course, is known for his academic work concerning the medieval Muslim-Christian interface of theology, mysticism, and religious practice, with a focus on Spain. His was a form of intellectual history. Among the figures studied were [[Al-Ghazali]], [[Ibn 'Arabi]], [[Averroës]] (Ibn Rushd), [[Ibn Masarra]], and [[Ibn Hazm]], as well as the rabbi [[Maimonides]] (all from [[Al-Andalus]] except al-Ghazali). Asín did comparative work vis-à-vis Islam respecting [[Ramon Lull]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Teresa of Avila]], [[John of the Cross]], and [[Blaise Pascal]].

Asín's manner of approach was to stick to a theme, to keep circling over it, each time adding to the understanding. His method of work involved meticulous planning, by first conceiving the order of presentation in detail, then straight ahead, without a rough draft ("sin borrador"), redacted with each reference note on its proper page.&lt;ref&gt;Emilio García Gómez, "Don Miguel Asín" in ''Al-Andalus'' 9:266-291 at 284, 287 (1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932 the journal ''Al-Andalus'' began publication under the direction of Asín Palacios; it was technically equipped to satisfy a readership of academic specialists. Asín himself was a frequent contributor. In the universities, a new generation of Spanish Arabists was emerging, such as [[Emilio García Gómez]], influenced by Asín.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''Continuations'' section below.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 Asín was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish Civil War]] began in July 1936, and caught Asín Palacios while in [[San Sebastián]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque country]] visiting his nephew and family. The horrors of this struggle remain very painful to contemplate with regard to both sides; over four thousand priests were assassinated by extremist factions on the loyalist side early in the conflict. Asín was in personal danger, yet that September nationalist forces captured San Sebastián. During the war he taught [[Latin]] and managed to obtain photocopies of Arabic texts.&lt;ref&gt;Valdivia Válor, ''Don Miguel Asín Palacios'' at 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' at 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emilio García Gómez, "Don Miguel Asín" in ''Al-Andalus'' 9:266-291 at 284-285 (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; After the trauma of Civil War, Asín was able to return to Madrid and resume his professorship at the university. There he continued his duties and his work on his multi-volume study of Al-Ghazali.

Don Miguel Asín Palacios had intense black eyes, fine hands; photographs did not seem to capture his personality or expressions. He was well dressed ("entre cardenal y torero"). Not ambitious but for the tranquility in which to work, he was a good and generous friend. His colleagues recognized in him an enduring innocence, so that he was "not knowing" in the mixed turbulence of the world.&lt;ref&gt;García Gómez affectionately commented that Asín sometimes would appear "un poco en la luna". "Don Miguel Asín (1873-1944) Esquema de una biografía" in ''Al-Andalus'' 9:266-291 at 289 (1944). One may conjecture whether Prof. García Gómez tended to type his teacher.&lt;/ref&gt; He projected a brightness ("diafanidad"); his mind had developed to become a great work of refinement. A pious priest, an admirer of [[John Henry Newman]], "a child of 73 years" when he died.&lt;ref&gt;Emilio García Gómez, "Don Miguel Asín (1873-1944) Esquema de una biografía" in ''Al-Andalus'' 9:266-291 at 287-289 (1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on August 12, 1944, in San Sebastián. His passing prompted many scholars to review his work.&lt;ref&gt;See bibliography below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Following early publications on [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[Ibn 'Arabi]] as noted above, Asín Palacios discussed, edited and rendered into Spanish translation many Arabic writings, and composed books and essays on related themes, including an occasional piece in Latin, French, or Italian.&lt;ref&gt;See "Selected Publications" section below. For descriptions of different critiques of Asín's works generally, see Valdivia Válor, ''Don Miguel Asín Palacios'' at 147-175; also the "Selected Commentary" section, infra.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquinas and Averroës===

[[Image:Thomas von Aquin 17th century sculpture.jpeg|150px|right|thumb|[[Thomas Aquinas]], sculpture (17th century).]]

[[Image:AverroesColor.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] ([[Averroës]]), detail from the painting ''Triunfo de Santo Tomás'' by [[Andrea di Bonaiuto da Firenze|Andrea da Bonaiuto]].]]

Asín Palacios researched Muslim influence on [[Thomas Aquinas|Tomás d'Aquino]] (c. 1225-1274), which would most likely come from the philosopher [[Ibn Rushd]] of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] (1126–1198), whether as protagonist or antagonist. Ibn Rushd came to be written ''Averroës'' in Latin. The result was the 1904 article, "El Averroísmo teológico de Santo Tomás de Aquino" by Asín, the professor from [[University of Zaragoza|Zaragoza]] newly arrived in [[Complutense University of Madrid|Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;Originally published in ''Homenaje a D. Francisco Codera en su jubilación del profesorado. Estudios de erudición oriental'' (Zaragoza: Escar 1904) at 271-331; reprinted in the collection of Asín's articles, ''Huellas del Islam'' (1941), at 11-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to [[Greek philosophy]], particularly [[Aristotle]], Asín infers that the religio-philosophic world inhabited by Averroës is analogous to that of Aquinas, and also to that of ben Maimon or [[Maimonides]] (1135–1204) the Jewish philosopher and [[talmud]]ist, also from Córdoba.&lt;ref&gt;Asín Palacios, "El Averroísmo" (1904), in ''Huellas del Islam'' (1941), e.g., cf., section III at 49, also VI at 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Asín understood that it was with piety that Averroës used reason to interpret his Islamic faith, and probes this issue for the sake of clearly distinguishing Averroës from several of the not-so-pious Latin "[[Averroists|Averroístas]]".&lt;ref&gt;Asín, "El Averroísmo" (1904), in ''Huellas del Islam'' (1941), III at 43, 45-46, especially 49; see also II at 21, and again V at 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Earlier Asín quoted rather extensively from Averroës, his ''Kitab al-Tahafut'' (ed. Cairo [[Anno Hegirae|A.H.]]1303), and the ''Kitab al-falsafat Ibn Rusd'' (ed. Cairo AH.1313), which contains two works including ''Fasl al-maqal'' (''Doctrina decisiva''). Asín, "El Averroísmo" (1904) in ''Huellas'' (1941), II at 21-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Asín also refers to medieval [[voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]] (called ''asaries'' in Islam), in order to contrast and distinguish the similar rationalisms held by Averroës and by Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;"El Averroísmo" (1904), in ''Huellas del Islam'' (1941), IV at 52, V at 57-60. [[Duns Scotus]] (1266-1308) was an advocate of voluntarism.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asín understood that Santo Tomás and Ibn Rusd, rather than legendary enemies, shared a similar task that encumbered their age, i.e., to reconcile faith and reason. Valdivia Válor, ''Don Miguel Asín Palacios'' (1992) at 104-107, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, many [[Thomists]] did not then accept without great controversy Asín's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;P. Chalmeta Gendrón, "Asín Palacios, Miguel" in ''Gran Enciclopedia Rialp'' [GER] (1991) [http://canalsocial.net GER]. As a medieval tactician, St. Thomas did write his ''De Unitate Intellectus Contra Averroistas'' [Paris 1270], translated as ''On the Unity of the Intellect against the Averroists'' (Marquette Univ. 1968); cf., Etienne Gilson, ''The Spirit of Mediaeval Philosophy'' (New York: Scribners 1936) at 176-178, 182-183. Nonetheless, what Asín presents here may be considered a modernist view point through a wide-angle lens, a [[philosophical anthropology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ibn Masarra===

In his 1914 book, ''[[Ibn Masarra|Abenmasarra]] y su escuela. Orígenes de la filosofía hispano-musulmana'',&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Douglas and Yoder as ''The Mystical Philosophy of Ibn Masarra and his Followers'' (Leiden: E. J. Brill 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Asín's ''Abenmasarra'' (1914) in general, see: Valdivia Válor, ''Don Miguel Asín Palacios'' (1992) at 107-114; James Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' (1970) at 180-182; and the somewhat sceptical Claude Addas, ''Quest for the Red Sulphur'' (1993) at 57-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Asín opens by describing the evolution of [[Islamic philosophy]] and [[Islamic cosmology|cosmology]] at the [[Abbasid dynasty|center of Islamic civilization]] in the East, in comparison with its later emergence in [[Al-Andalus]] (Muslim Iberia).&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''The Mystical Philosophy'' (1914, 1978), Chapters I [1-14] and II [15-29].&lt;/ref&gt; A brief biography of [[Ibn Masarra]] (883-931) follows. There Asín posits the continuation of pre-existing Iberian culture among Hispanic natives who, following [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|its conquest]], [[Conversion to Islam|converted to Islam]]. Because of Abenmasarra's father's [[Political clientelism|client status]] (to his Berber [[mawla]]), Asín infers that he was such a Muslim 'Spaniard' (a [[muladi]]). Asín describes his affinity to Greek philosophy, i.e., [[neoplatonism]], then notes the accusations of heresy against him, and that he early concealed his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''The Mystical Philosophy'' (1914, 1978), Chap. III [30-42]: at 30 (continuity of thought), at 30-31 (father's client status), at 32 (his early ideas [received from his father]).&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the Muslim [[Umayyad Caliphate#Umayyad Emirs of Córdoba|ruler]] faced severe political unrest, being challenged by armed rebels such as '[[Umar ibn Hafsun]]; accordingly the [[Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi|Emir]] showed little tolerance for religious dissenters like Abenmasarra.&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''The Mystical Philosophy'' (1914, 1978), Chap. III: at 33-34 ('Umar ibn Hafsun), 33-35 (political oppression).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Spencer Trimingham, ''The Sufi Orders in Islam'' (Oxford University 1971) at 46:&lt;blockquote&gt;"In Spain, although there was a brief flowering associated with Ibn Masarra (AD 883-931) and his pupils, Sufism could not thrive openly in the atmosphere of intolerance and suspicion that prevailed there.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Masarra's books were later burned in public during the year 951. Claude Addas, "Andalusi Mysticism and the rise of Ibn 'Arabi" at 909-933, 918, in ''The Legacy of Muslims Spain'' (Leiden: Brill 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Masarra felt compelled to flee, traveling to [[Qairawan]] and [[Mecca]]. Yet eventually he managed to return to Córdoba under the [[Abd ar-Rahman III|next Emir]], and to set up his School which contained sufi elements.&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''The Mystical Philosophy'' (1914, 1978), Chap. III [30-42]: at 35-38 (ostracism by pressure from the Córdoba [[faqih]]), 36-37 (travels), 38-41 (Ibn Masarra's return to Córdoba and his "[[tariqah]]"), 41 (his books). The Umayyad [[Abd ar-Rahman III]] (891-961) (r.912-961) in 929 became the first [[Caliph of Córdoba]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Using newly discovered sources, Ibn Masarra is called a "Neoplatonist philosopher" of the Qur'an by Ahmet Karamustafa in his ''Sufism. The formative period'' (University of California 2007), at 72; Asín heads the long list of his references at note 63 (pp.80-81).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ibn Gabirol.JPG|right|100px|thumb|[[Ibn Gabirol]], influenced by Ibn Masarra's school.]]

Actually Asín's work is less about [[Ibn Masarra]] of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] (due to a then lack of surviving sources),&lt;ref&gt;In 1914 Asín thought that not a single work of Ibn Masarra nor any fragments survived [''The Mystical Philosophy'' at IV:43]. Asín inferred his school's original teachings based on, for example, medieval biographers (al-Faradi, al-Dabbi, Ibn Khaqan, and al-Maqqari [III:32,n.6]), two Iberian commentators (Ibn Hazm, and Sa'id of Toledo) [IV:43; VI:73], and on the writings of his followers (in particular Ibn 'Arabi) [IV:43-44; VI:73] and of his adversaries.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Subsequently, two manuscripts of Ibn Masarra have been located (''Kitab al-huruf'' [Book of Letters], &amp; ''Kitab al-tabsira'' [Book of Clear Explanation]); very recently both have been translated into Spanish by Pilar Garrido. Cf., P. Garrido, "The Science of Letters in Ibn Massara" in ''Journal of the Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi Society'' 47: 47-61, at 48. Asín [''Mys. Phil.'' at III:41,n.23] knew of these titles only from references to them by others, for example, [[Ibn Hazm]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These works of Ibn Masarra are discussed by Claude Addas, "Andalusi Mysticism and the Rise of Ibn 'Arabi" at 909-933, 916-918, in ''The Legacy of Muslim Spain'' (Leiden: E. J. Brill 1992), edited by [[Salma Khadra Jayyusi]].&lt;/ref&gt; than about his "school" of early Muslim mystics in [[al-Andalus]]. With reference to their teachings and its context, Asín discusses the [[Batin (Islam)|batini]], the [[mutazili]], the [[shi'a]], and the [[sufism|sufis]] of Islam, as well as the Greco-Roman mystic [[Plotinus]] (205-270), and especially the pseudo-Empedocles.&lt;ref&gt;Asín's theory that the pseudo-Empedocles was a source for Ibn Masarra's teachings has been challenged. Cf., Claude Addas, her ''Ibn 'Arabi ou La quéte du Soufre Rouge'' (Paris: Editions Gallimard 1989), translated by [[Peter Kingsley (scholar)|Peter Kingsley]] as ''Quest for the Red Sulphur. The Life of Ibn 'Arabi'' (Cambridge: Islamic Texts Society 1993) at 57-58, and the article by the Ismaili scholar Samuel Miklos Stern, cited there at note 113. Elsewhere Addas states, "[T]he possible influence exerted by Eastern [Muslim] mystics on Ibn Masarra [is] a more decisive influence, in my view, than any pseudo-Empedocles might have had." Addas, "Andalusi Mysiticism and the rise of Ibn 'Arabi" at 909-933, 914, 918, in ''The Legacy of Muslim Spain'' (Leiden: Brill 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;But compare the pseudo-Empedocles named by [[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera|Shem Tob Falaquera]] (1225-1290) in discussing [[Ibn Gabirol]] (1021-1058), cited by Isaac Husik in his ''A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy'' (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society 1941), at 60-61, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Mentioned several times by Asín is a perspective he favored: eastern Christianity's early influence on the young religion before Islam's arrival in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Abenmasarra y su escuela'' (1914), translated as ''The Mystical Philosophy of Ibn Masarra and his Followers'' (1978), for example, at 2-3, 12-13, 28, 88-89, 91 (and in Asín's prior works referenced at 12, footnote 25).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Confirmation of Asín's perspective appears to be given in a later book by the scholar [[Margaret Smith (author)|Margaret Smith]], ''Early Mysticism in the Near and Middle East'' (London: Sheldon Press 1931; reprint Oneworld 1995) at Chap.VI, 103-124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [[Robert Charles Zaehner|R.C.Zaehner]], ''Hindu and Muslim Mysticism'' (Univ.of London 1960; reprints: Schocken 1969, Oneworld 1994) at 86-87, 92, 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Asín infers that Ibn Masarra's school influenced [[Ibn al-Arif]] (1088–1141) of [[Almería]].&lt;ref&gt;Asín's inference is based on an admitted dearth of 10th-century sources but indirectly on later Muslims of al-Andalus, i.e., on Ibn 'Arabi, whose own early writings drew heavily on the circle formed by Ibn al'Arif. Asín, ''The Mystical Philosophy'' (1914, 1978) at VIII:122-123.&lt;/ref&gt; This Ibn al-'Arif became the focus of an emerging Sufi circle later called the ''muridin''. His followers spread out over al-Andalus, but they became too strong in the opinion of the governing power;&lt;ref&gt;One ''muridin'' shaikh managed to set up a rival government in the [[Algarves]]. This Abu 'l-Qasim "demonstrated how easily spiritual power can aspire to mundane power when he rose from his ''rabat'' [fort], [the year [[Ibn al-Arif]] died], and subjected [lands in Southern Portugal] before he was killed in 546/1151." Trimingham, ''The Sufi Orders in Islam'' (1971) at 46.&lt;/ref&gt; they were variously suppressed by the [[Almoravids]] who then ruled al-Andalus from [[Marrakech]].&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''The Mystical Philosophy'' (1914, 1978) at VIII:121-123 (Ibn al-'Arif and his circle). The Berber [[Almoravids]] deported Ibn al-'Arif to Marrakech, where he was accused of heterodoxy and died in 1141. His follower Ibn Qasi managed to escape, to organize adepts into a militia under the mystic name ''muridin'', and to prosecute a sustained revolt. ''Ibid.'' at VIII:122.&lt;/ref&gt; Asín then discusses the influence of the school on Jewish figures of al-Andalus, for example, [[Judah ha-Levi]] (c. 1085-c. 1140),&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Isaak Heinemann, editor, "Jehuda Halevi: ''Kusari''", in ''Three Jewish Philosophers'' (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America c. 1946; reprint by Atheneum 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; and in particular on [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] (c. 1021-1058), known in Latin as ''Avicebron''.&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''The Mystical Philosophy'' (1914, 1978) at VIII:130-131 (ibn Gabirol, aka Avicebron) and 129 (Judah ha-Levi).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Isaac Husik, ''A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy'' (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society 1941) at 59-79 (Solomon ibn Gabirol), and 150-183 (Judah Halevi).&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Gabirol wrote in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] the book ''Fons Vitae'' which still survives.&lt;ref&gt;''Fons Vitae'' being the book's well-known title in its Latin translation, meaning "Fountain of Life".&lt;/ref&gt; It apparently shows clear [[neo-Platonic]] references to the school of Ibn Masarra.&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''The Mystical Philosophy'' (1914, 1978) at VIII:130-131. Regarding [[Ibn Gabirol]], Asín cites to the near contemporary writings of [[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera|Shem-Tob b. Joseph Falaquera]], and also references to 19th-century scholarship by David Kaufmann, ''Studien über Salomon Ibn Gabirol'' (Budapest 1899) at 52-58, and Solomon Munk, ''Mélanges de Philosophie Juive et Arabe'' (Paris 1859) at 241 [generally 151-306]. Munk made the then surprising discovery that it was Ibn Gabirol who wrote the ''Fons Vitae''. Asín (1914, 1978) at VIII:130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Husik, ''A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy (1941) at 60, 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asín points to the impact of these Muslim and Jewish thinkers of Spain regarding medieval [[History of Christian theology|Christian theology]], for example, the long drawn-out struggle between the [[Aristotle|Aristotilean]] ideas of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) and those of [[Duns Scotus]] (1266–1308).&lt;ref&gt;''The Mystical Philosophy'' at VIII:144-145.&lt;/ref&gt; Asín's dogged research, on the persistent influence of Ibn Masarra's school of mystical philosophy, leads him to follow its tracks eventually to [[Ibn 'Arabi]] (1165–1240),&lt;ref&gt;Ibn 'Arabi wrote that Ibn Masarra was "one of the greatest masters of the Way in terms of knowledge, spiritual state and revelation." Claude Addas, ''Quest for Red Sulphur. The Life of Ibn 'Arabi'' (Cambridge: Islamic Text Society 1993) at 58, citing the ''Futuhat'' of Ibn 'Arabi at I: 147.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to [[Ramon Lull]] (1233–1315) and to [[Roger Bacon]] (c. 1214-c. 1294).&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''The Mystical Philosophy'' (1914, 1978) at 73-82, 123-143, 173-183 (Ibn 'Arabi); at 136-144, 173-183 (Ramon Lull); at 134-137, 144 (Roger Bacon). Asín quoted from Bacon's ''Opus majus'' as edited by Jebb, at 26: "Philosophy comes through the influence of divine illumination." Bacon later refers to "the Muslims" and, at 46, to the "illumination" taught by the Persian philosopher [[Ibn Sina]] [Avicenna]. ''The Mystical Philosophy'' at VIII:136 n.48.&lt;/ref&gt; Later another scholar would find evidence that may link the school of Ibn Masarra to the [[illuminationist philosophy|philosopher of light]] [''al-Ishraq''] and mystic of Iran, [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi|Suhrawardi]] (c. 1155-1191).&lt;ref&gt;Independently, [[Henry Corbin]] in his ''L'imagination créatrice dans le Soufisme d'Ibn 'Arabi'' (Paris: Flammarion 1958), translated as ''Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn 'Arabi'' (Princeton Univ. [Bollingen] 1969), "saw" connections, through the ''alam al-mithal'' [subtle world] [35-36] and perhaps via Ibn 'Arabi, between the ''school'' of Ibn Masarra and the mystical philosophy of Muslim Iran, for example, Suhrawardi's ''Ishraq'' [light]. Corbin (1958, 1969) at 25-26, 48-49; cf., 367-368. Corbin cites Asín here, and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]], ''The Mystical &amp; Visionary Treatises of Suhrawardi'', translated with an introduction by W. M. Thackston, Jr. (London: The Octagon Press 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Asín's 1914 ''Abenmasarra y su escuela'' established a lasting influence on subsequent scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;"It would be impossible to overestimate the importance of this work, which has exerted a decisive and lasting influence on the whole approach taken toward Andalusi Sufism by ''orientalists''." [Emphasis added]. Claude Addas, "Andalusi Mysticism and the Rise of Ibn 'Arabi" at 909-933, 912, in ''The Legacy of Muslim Spain'' (Leiden: E. J. Brill 1992), edited by Salma Khadra Jayyusi. Regarding Asín, the sometimes mistaken yet respected 'pioneer', cf., 912-913, 919-920. She discusses Ibn Masarra at 911-919.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dante Alighieri===

[[File:Dante Alighieri01.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Dante Alighieri]], at [[Uffizi|Palazzo degli Uffizi]], Florence.]]

Perhaps Asín Palacios is best remembered for his 1919 book, ''La Escatologia Musulmana en la Divina Comedia'',&lt;ref&gt;[Muslim eschatology in the Divine Comedy]. See below under "Selected Publications" for details on its editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valdivia Válor, ''Don Miguel Asín Palacios'' (1992) at 118-120, 150-160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' (1970) at 182-184.&lt;/ref&gt; which sparked lively and extended discussions among Dante scholars. Asíin here suggests Islamic sources for the theological landscapes used by the Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265–1321) in his work [[Divine Comedy|''La Divina Commedia'']],&lt;ref&gt;Dante's admiration for [[Islamic philosophy]] was clear from his "favorable" placement of the philosophers [[Ibn Rushd]] (Averroës) and [[Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) in the poem. Cf., [[Frederick Copleston]], ''A History of Philosophy'', vol. 2, ''Mediaeval Philosophy'' at Part 1: 225-226; and at Part 2: 161 (Westminster MD: Newman Press 1950; reprint [in two parts] by Doubleday/Image 1962).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asín refers to his own precursors regarding Dante, for example, Bruno Nardi. Asín, ''La Escatologia Musulmana en la Divina Comedia'' (Madrid-Granada: Escuelas de Estudios Árabes, segunda edición, 1943) at 4; &amp; 397-399, 452.&lt;/ref&gt; written c.1308 to 1320.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. B. Lewis, ''Dante'' (New York: Viking 2001), p. 101 (1308 or 1309 start), p. 189 (1320 finish).&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Asín compares the Muslim religious literature surrounding the [[mi'raj|night journey]] [al-'Isra wal-Mi'rag] of [[Muhammad]] (from [[Mecca]] to [[Jerusalem]] and thence up with the [[Prophets of Islam|prophets]] through the seven [[jannah|heavens]]),&lt;ref&gt;The [[Mi'raj]] or ''night journey'' [''mi'ray'' in Spanish] is briefly mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] at the sura so named (XVII, 1-2), and perhaps alluded to twice more (LIII,1; LXXXIV, 19).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mi'raj is described authoritatively in [[Hadith]], for example, of [[Sahih Muslim]], whose text in English can be found in ''Early Muslim Mysticism'' edited by Michael A. Sells (Paulist Press 1996) at 49-53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mi'raj is also described by [[Ibn Ishaq]] (A.H. 85-151) in his "biography" of the prophet, in Alfred Guillaume (ed.), ''The Life of Muhammad. A translation of Ishaq's "[[Sirat Rasul Allah]]"'' (Oxford University 1955) at 181-187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geo Widengren, ''Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and his Ascension'' (Uppsala 1955), for example, at 96-114.&lt;/ref&gt; with Dante's story describing his spiritual journey in which he meets various inhabitants of the [[afterlife]] and records their [[Divine Judgment|fate]].&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''The Divine Comedy'' (New York: New American Library 1954), translated by [[John Ciardi]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dante Luca.jpg|140px|thumb|right|Dante, detail from [[Luca Signorelli]] fresco at [[Duomo di Orvieto]].]]

Accordingly, Asín (I) discusses in detail the above night journey in Muslim literature,&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Escatologia'' (2d ed., 1943) at Part I, 9-120, and also Appendix I, 425-443.&lt;/ref&gt; (II) compares it to episodes in the [[hell|inferno]],&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Escatologia'' (2d ed., 1943) at Part II/3-5: 133-175.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[purgatory|purgatorio]],&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Escatologia'' (2d ed., 1943) at Part II/6: 175-191.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[heaven|paradiso]]&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Escatologia'' (2d ed., 1943) at Part II/7-9: 192-266.&lt;/ref&gt; of ''La Divina Commedia'', (III) investigates Muslim influence on corresponding Christian literature predating the poem,&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Escatologia'' (2d ed., 1943) at Part III: 271-353.&lt;/ref&gt; and (IV) conjectures how Dante could have known directly of the Muslim literature in translation.&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Escatologia'' (2d ed., 1943) at Part IV: 355-421.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Asín's ''La Escatologia'' it was assumed that Dante drew from the long poem the ''[[Aeneid]]'' by the ancient Roman poet [[Virgil]] for the inspiration to create the memorable scenes of the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;In Virgil's ''Aeneid'', Book VI, lines 301-447, the hero [[Aeneas]] enters the [[Greek underworld|underworld]], and later visits his deceased father Anchises (lines 910-972), who shows Aeneas a vision of the future, and of Rome (lines 973-1219).&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Divina Comedia'', Dante himself plays the leading role; he is guided by the deceased poet Virgil as they travel through the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' and the ''[[Purgatorio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''The Inferno'' (New York: New American Library 1954; reprint Mentor Books), Canto 1, lines 61-84 (Dante meets Virgil, who acts as his guide).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Purgatorio'' (New York: New American Library 1954; reprint Mentor), Canto XXX, lines 46-56 (his guide Virgil disappears), lines 55-75 (replaced by Beatrice).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. W. B. Lewis, ''Dante'' (New York: Viking 2001), pp. 102-104 (Virgil and Beatrice, as guides); 113-114 (Virgil's role), regarding the ''Divine Comedy''.&lt;/ref&gt; Asín remarks that the addition of the Muslim sources in no way detracts from Dante's achievement, and that Dante remains a luminous figure and his poem retains its exalted place in world literature.&lt;ref&gt;Asín Palacios, ''La Escatologia Musulmana en la Divina Comedia'' (2d ed., 1943), for example, at 420 (el "inspirado" florentino que por "su poema inmortal" alcanzó "enamorados de la belleza de su arte exquisito").&lt;/ref&gt;

Asín's book inspired a wide and energetic reaction, both positive and negative, as well as [[Divine Comedy#Islamic philosophy|further research]] and academic exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;See "Commentary" section, regarding: Massignon, G. Gabrieli, Guillaume, Arnold, Levi della Vida, Cerulli, Muñoz Sendino, F. Gabrieli.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Asín's response to his critics, "Historia y crítica de una polémica" (1924).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Valdivia Válor, ''Don Miguel Asín Palacios'' (1992) at 150-160.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually two scholars, an Italian and a Spaniard, independently uncovered an until-then buried Arabic source, the 11th-century ''[[Kitab al-Miraj|Kitab al-Mi'raj]]'' [Book of the Ladder (or of the ascent)],&lt;ref&gt;José Muñoz Sendino, ''La Escala de Mahoma, tradución del árabe al castellano, latín y francés, ordenada por Alfonso X el sabio'' (Madrid 1949). Muñoz Sendino also wrote the prólogo to ''La escala de Mahoma'' (Madrid 1949).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Concurrent work by Enrico Cerulli, ''Il "Libro della Scala" e la questione della fonti arabo-spagnole della Divina Commedia'' (Vatican 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; which describes Muhammad's night journey. This work was translated into Spanish as ''La Escala de Mahoma'' [The Ladder of Muhammad] by a scribe (Abrahim Alfaquim) of the Spanish king [[Alfonso X]] el Sabio in 1264.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the translations made by this royal scriptorium of Alfonso X (r.1252-1284), cf., [http://faculty.washington.edu/petersen/alfonso/esctra13.htm Escuela de Traductores] (in English).&lt;/ref&gt;

Information also surfaced about another translation of it into Latin, ''Liber Scalae Machometi'', which has been traced to the Italian milieu of the poet, Dante Alighieri.&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Francesco Gabrieli|Francesco Gabrieli]], "New lignt on Dante and Islam", in ''East &amp; West'', IV: 173-180 (Rome 1953) at 175-176. This article includes a review of the prior scholarship of Cerulli and Muñoz Sendino.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gérman Sepúlveda, ''Influencia del Islam en la Divina Comedia'' (Santiago de Chile: Instituto Chileno-Arabe de Cultura 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently Dante's mentor [[Brunetto Latini]] met the Latin translator of the ''Kitab al-Mi'raj'' while both were staying at the court of king Alfonso X el Sabio in [[Crown of Castile|Castilla]].&lt;ref&gt;As [[Divine Comedy#Islamic philosophy|reported]], in 2000 [[:it:Maria Corti|Maria Corti]] discussed Dante's Italian mentor [[Brunetto Latini]] (1220-1294), that he met Bonaventura de Siena, thought to be the Latin translator of the ''Kitab al-Mi'raj'', at the court of Alfonso X of Spain. Cf., [http://www.emsf.rai.it/interviste/interviste.asp?d=490#3 Dante e l'Islam] (Italian interview with Maria Corti, April 2000). Latini's trip was probably circa 1259; he returned to [[Tuscany]] in 1266. Dante wrote ''La Divina Commedia'' much later, in his last years, 1308-1321. Prof. Corti comments on our 'surprise' if Latini had given Dante a copy of the translation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]], ''España, eslabón entre la Cristiandad y el Islam'' (Madrid: Espasa-Calpe 1956, 2d ed. 1968) at 59-60, where he further corroborates this connection.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Julia Bolton Holloway, "The Road through Roncesvalles: Alfonsine formation of Brunetto Latini and Dante--Diplomacy and Literature," 109-123, e.g., at 109, 112, 123, in Robert I. Burns, editor, ''Emperor of Culture. Alfonso X the Learned of Castile and his thirteenth-century Renaissance'' (University of Pennsylvania 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Although this missing link was not available to Asín, he had based his work on several similar accounts of Muhammad's ladder then circulating among the literary or pious Muslims of [[Al-Andalus]].&lt;ref&gt;Asín Palacios, ''La Escatologia Musulmana en la Divina Comedia'' (2d ed., 1943), especially in Part I at chapters 2 &amp; 3, and translations in the first Appendix. Regarding Ibn 'Arabi: his derivative work, at 76-77, 79-84, 181-184; Asín's comparison of him with Dante, at 399-412, 417-418; and Asín's epilogue, at 418-421.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ibn Hazm===

The importance of [[Ibn Hazm]] of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] (994-1064) to the Muslim culture of Spain was earlier recognized by Asín. He had outlined Ibn Hazm's influence on medieval Islam,&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Discursos leídos ante la Real Acadamia de la Historia en la receptión publica del señor D. Miguel Asín Palacios el día 18 de mayo de 1924'' (Madrid 1924). Cited by Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' (1970) at 186.&lt;/ref&gt; and had published a study with translation which addressed his ethical thought,&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Los caracteres y la conducta, tratado de moral práctica por Abenházam de Córdoba'' (Madrid 1916), an ethical study by Asín, which translates Ibn Hazm's ''Akhlaq''.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a volume concerning Ibn Hazm's views on religious history.&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''El Cordobés Abenházam, primer historador de las ideas religiosas'' (Madrid: Estanislao Maestre 1924).&lt;/ref&gt; During his career, Ibn Hazm became a remarkable figure, not least for the wide scope of his abilities, e.g., producing significant writings as a [[theology|theologian]], as a [[jurisprudence|jurist]],&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Hazm was then a leading [[Zahiri]] jurist, whose influence was lasting. Cf., Knut S. Vikor, ''Between God and Sultan. A History of Islamic Law'' (Oxford University 2005) at 117-119.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a [[poetry|poet]].&lt;ref&gt;His poetry appears in annotated translations by Asín's former student, [[Emilio García Gómez]], in his ''El collar de la poloma, tratato sobre el amor y los amantes de Ibn Hazm de Córdoba'' (Madrid 1952).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also the English translation of A. R. Nykl, ''The Dove's Neck-Ring'' (Paris 1931).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Such medieval Arabic poetry influenced the [[troubadours]]. Ramón Menéndez Pidal, ''España, Eslabón entre la Christiandad y el Islam'' (Madrid: Espasa-Calpe 1956, 1968) at 17-18 (citing Asín).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Interior of the [[Cathedral–Mosque of Córdoba|Mezquita]] at Córdoba.]]

From 1927 to 1932, Asín published a 5-volume study, ''Abenházam de Córdoba y su historia crítica de las ideas religiosas'' [Ibn Hazm of Cordoba and his "Critical History of Religious Ideas"].&lt;ref&gt;Citations here to Asín's ''Abenházam'' (1927-1932) are generally to the reprint by Ediciones Turner (Madrid, 1984), also 5 volumes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a contemporaneous review by Ángel González Palencia, see ''Al Andalus'' at I: 213-214 (1933).&lt;/ref&gt; Asín's first volume presents a biography, including his life as a jurist/politician and his trail through the world of intellect; Asín here gives a critique of the writings of the medieval Spanish Muslim, focusing on Ibn Hazm as a theologian and as an early [[history of religion|historian of religions]].&lt;ref&gt;Thus Asín did not intend to elaborate on his poetry, his jurisprudence, his political history, or his ethics, as these subjects had already been addressed by others, for example, Nykl, [[Goldziher]], [[Reinhart Dozy|Dozy]], and Asín himself. Asín, ''Abenházam'' (1927-1932) at I: 9. Yet Asín's bibliography, at I: 246-279, provides a catalogue of Ibn Hazm's works in Philosophy, Jurisprudence, Theology, History, and Literature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monre, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' (Leiden: E.J.Brill 1970) at 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining four volumes comprise an incomplete yet lengthy translation of Ibn Hazm's ''Fisal'',&lt;ref&gt;Asín does not translate the entire text; for various sections he provides only a summary with analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Arnaldez]] criticized Asín as a translator of Ibn Hazm's ''Fisal'' for not sufficiently entering into the Islamic language and its special environment, and for "Christianizing" some lexicon. Arnáldez, ''Grammaire et théologie chez Ibn Hazm de Cordoue. Essai sur la structure et les conditions de la pensee musulman'' (Paris 1956) at 320. Nonetheless Arnáldez approved of Asín's biography and of his respectful commentary on Ibn Hazm. Cited by Valdivia Válor, ''Don Miguel Asín'' (1992) at 160-161.&lt;/ref&gt; a very long work on the history of religious ideas, its Arabic title being ''Kitab al-Fisal fi al-milal wa-al-ahwa' wa-al-nihal'' [Book of Separation. Concerning [[Religion]]s, [[Heresies]], and [[Sect]]s].&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Hazm's ''Fisal'' became well-known, for example, it is cited by [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1406) in his [[Muqaddimah]], e.g., at the end of section 25 on the [[Shi'a]] (Rosenthal's 1958 translation, v.1 at 414).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the ''Kitab al-Fisal'', cf., Reynold A. Nicholson, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'' (London: T. Fisher Unwin 1907; reprint: Cambridge University 1962) at 427-428.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Hazm's ''Fisal'' has six parts: 1. non-Muslim religions (in Asín's volumes II-III), 2. Muslim sects (Asín's III-IV), 3. Muslim faith and theology (IV), 4. several constitutional questions regarding Islamic government (V), 5. Muslim heresies (V), 6. theology in 29 questions (V). In part 1 of the ''Fisal'', Ibn Hazm gives a polemical description of Christian [[New Testament|scriptures]] and [[Trinity|trinitarian doctrine]], its putative errors and contradictions, showing familiarity with the texts. He also comments on [[Judaism]], [[Zoroastrianism|Zarathustra]],&lt;ref&gt;About [[Zoroaster|''Zoroastro'']] and his religion (II: 127-131, 231-237), Ibn Hazm acknowledges them as [[people of the book]] (II: 233), yet whose sacred writings have been alterred--like those of Jews and Christians (II: 233, 237).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hinduism|Brahmans]], [[sophism|sophists]], [[atheism|atheists]], and [[polytheism|polytheists]]. According to Asín, many subsequent anti-Christian polemics by Muslims more or less followed part I of Ibn Hazm's ''Fisal''.&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Discursos leídos ante la Real Acadamia de la Historia'' (Madrid 1924). Cf., Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs'' (1970) at 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Abdelilah Ljamai, ''Ibn Hazm et la polémique Islamo-chrétienne dans l'Histoire de l'Islam'' (Leiden: Brill 2003), e.g., the [[Hanbali]] jurist [[Ibn Taymiyya]] (1263-1328) at 175-183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [[Ignaz Goldziher]], ''Die Zâhiriten'' (Leipzig 1884), translated by W.Behn as ''The Zahiris. Their Doctrine and their History'' (Leiden 1971). Goldziher makes a reference to "Ibn Hazm who distinguishes himself by his fanatical enmity against everything non-Islamic." Goldziher (1971) at 56; also at 60, "his personal fanaticism against followers of other religions"; and at 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Asín, in his "Disertación preliminar" to the ''Fisal'', compares the late emergence of [[comparative religion|comparative religious]] history in Christian Europe with its relative early start in Islam, noting the geographical proximity of Islam to a variety of differing religions.&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Abenházam'' (1927-1932) at II: 7-79.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an early Islamic work that discusses [[Buddhism]] appeared in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;This being the ''Fihrist'', which sets out its perceptions about Buddhism, its sects, cults, monastic orders, ceremonies, temples. Asín, ''Abenházam de Córdoba'' (1927-1932) at II: 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Relevant here is a near contemporary [[Zoroastrian]] work, the [[Shikand-gumanic Vichar]], a synchronic approach to differing religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) with an evident polemical purpose.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Asín more than once refers to Ibn Hazm as the first historian of religions.&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Abenházam'' (1927-1932) at II: 33-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asín Palacio's biography shows Ibn Hazm as once [[vizier]] to the declining [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate of Córdoba|caliphs]] before retiring to his study.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Asín, ''Abenházam'' (1927-1932) at I: 136; compare, at 227.&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of his career Ibn Hazm had become a Muslim [[faqih|jurist]] of the ''[[Zahiri]]'' (or "literalist") [[madhhab|school of law]].&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Abenházam'' (1927-1932) at I: 5; discussion in his chapter X, "Abenházam, Jurista [[Shafii|Xafeí]]" at I: 121-130, and chapter XI, "Abenházam, Jurista [[Zahiri|Dahirí]]" at I: 131-144. Yet the [[Maliki]] was the [[madhhab]] which prevailed in [[al-Andaluz]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Generally: [[Ignaz Goldziher]], ''Die Zâhiriten'' (Leipzig 1884), translated by W.Behn as ''The Zahiris. Their Doctrine and their History'' (Leiden 1971). Goldziher recognizes Ibn Hazm: "Among the champions of the Dawudi [Zahiri] school this remarkable man is known as the most famous by far." Goldziher (1971) at 109.&lt;/ref&gt; His legal treatise on [[fiqh]], ''Ibtal'',&lt;ref&gt;Longer title: ''Ibtal al-qiyas wa-al-ra'y wa-al-istihsan wa-al-taqlid wa-al-ta'wil'' [Refutation of analogy, learned opinion, social equity, juristic authority, and 'insight' text interpretation]; title in Spanish per Asín: "Libro que de muestra la inanidad del uso de estos cinco criterios jurídicos: el argumento de analogía, la opinión personal, la equidad o preferencia, la autoridad de los maestros y la investigación del espiritu de la ley". Listed in Asín's biography in his ''Abenházam'' (1927-1932) at I: 259; cf., his chapter XI, "Abenházam, Jurista [[Zahiri|Dahirí]]" at I: 131-144.&lt;/ref&gt; is referenced by Asín and regards the Zahiri rejection of the [[heuristic]] use of [[Qiyas|analogy]], [[Ahl ar-ra'y|learned opinion]], [[Istihsan|social equity]], [[Taqlid|juristic authority]], and [[Ta'wil|'spirit' of the law]], as unacceptable [[usul al-fiqh|legal method]].&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Abenházam'' (1927-1932), at I: 140-144.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in his ''Fisal'', as a jurist Ibn Hazm addresses possible rebellion against an unjust [[Imam]]; the distinction is made between not obeying an unjust order and taking action to overthrow an unjust ruler.&lt;ref&gt;At part 4 of the ''Fisal'' (Asín's volume V, at 7-51), at chapter 4, which Asín entitles "Necessity of the Imam" (Asín at 34-43).&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Hazm enters another controversy, opining that women may be given inspiration by God, referring to the "mujer de Abraham" (i.e., [[Sarah]]) and to the "madre de Jesús" [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|María]] (like [[Muhammad|Mahoma]] visited by the "ángel [[Gabriel]]").&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Abenházam de Córdoba'' (1927-1932) in vol.V: 175-180 (part 6, Ch.4), at 177-179.&lt;/ref&gt; After publication of Asín's 5-volume study, additional writings of Ibn Hazm were discovered in the library of the [[Fatih Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]], including legal ''responsa'', to which Asin devoted an article.&lt;ref&gt;"Un Códice inexplorada de Cordobés Ibn Hazm" in ''Al Andalus'', 2: 1-56 (1934).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ibn 'Arabi===

[[Image:Ibn Arabi.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Muhyiddin [[Ibn 'Arabī]] &lt;br /&gt; Arabic: ابن عربي &lt;br /&gt;Spanish: Abenarabi.]]

Another work by Asín, which became well-known to scholars of Islam, addresses the life and the sufi philosophy of [[Ibn 'Arabi|Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi]] (1165–1240) of the [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] city of [[Murcia]]. Asín Palacios had already written a number of studies and translations of Ibn 'Arabi, the revered (and controversial) mystic,&lt;ref&gt;Six prior articles (1899, 1906, 1925, 1926, 1926, 1928) of Asín are listed in ''El Islam cristianizado'' at p.6 note 1, as well as the discussion of Ibn 'Arabi in his 1919 book on Dante. Several later articles by Asín are cited in ''Al Andalus'', V: 239-241, 240 (1940), where Asín reviews A.E.Affifi's ''The Mystical Philosophy of Muhyid Din Ibnul Arabi'' (1939); therein Asín refers to Ibn 'Arabi as "profound, knowledgeable and erudite, complicated and subtle, well versed in all the Islamic systems of thought." ''Ibid.'' at 241.&lt;/ref&gt; but his major work was ''El Islam cristianizado. Estudio del sufismo a través de las obras de Abenarabi de Murcia'' (Madrid 1931).&lt;ref&gt;For details see "Selected Publications by Asín" below, under "Books".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the discussions in: Valdivia Válor, ''Don Miguel Asín Palacios'' at 127-136, 162-174; Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' at 188-189; Addas, ''Quest for the Red Sulphur'', mixed at 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Corbin]] remarks on Asín's title ''El Islam cristianizado'':&lt;blockquote&gt;"The pious sentiment which inspired the great Spanish Arabic scholar with this strange title is perceptible throughout the work, which is still of the utmost value. But it is regrettable that he should have applied language and ideas befitting a Christian monk to a Sufi like Ibn 'Arabi; their vocations are different, and in employing such a method one runs the risk of blurring the originality of both types." Corbin, ''L'imagination créatrice dans le Soufisme d'Ibn 'Arabi'' (Paris: Flammarion 1958), translated by Ralph Manheim as ''Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn 'Arabi'' (Princeton Univ. [Bollingen] 1969) at 39 n.12.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Following an introduction that proposes that Sufism emerged from the influence of Christian monasticism on Islam, the book presents three parts: first, a short life of Ibn 'Arabi [31-118]; second, commentaries that approach the complexity of his voluminous writings, his [[mysticism|mystical]] teachings, his place in [[sufism]], and his subsequent influence [119-274]; third, selections translated from seven of Ibn 'Arabi's works, including the Meccan ''Fotuhat'' [275-518].&lt;ref&gt;Works translated by Asín: ''Tohfa'' (Regalo para el Viaje a la Corte de la Santidad) [277-299], ''Amr'' (La regla taxativa que fija las condiciones que deben cumplir los que siguen el camino de Dios) [300-351], ''Tadbirat'' (Polítical Divina en el Gobierno del Reino Humano) [352-377], ''Cunh'' (Epístola sobre lo que es esencialmente Indispensable al Novicio) [371-377], ''Mawaqui'' (Descenso de los Astros y Ascensiones de los Místicos) [378-432], ''Anwar'' (Tratado de las Luces, o sea, de los Misterios con que favorece Dios al que entra en la Soledad) [433-449], and ''Fotuhat'' (Las Revelaciones de Meca acerca del Conocimiento de Dios y del Mundo) [450-518].&lt;/ref&gt;

Asín's brief biography describes Ibn 'Arabi's youthful 'conversion' to an inward path and first teachers,&lt;ref&gt;When about fifteen years old, after his acknowledgement of his young wife's virtues, as well as his suffering through a severe illness, Ibn 'Arabe received a calling and so changed his life. Before devoted to literature and hunting, afterwards he found and followed spiritual teachers. Asín, ''El Islam'' (1931, 1990) at 36-37, ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shortly after finishing ''El Islam'' Asín translated Ibn 'Arabi's ''Ruh al-Quds'', his tribute to his early teachers of al-Andaluz. ''Vidas de santones andaluces, la "Epistola de la santidad" de Ibn 'Arabi de Murcia'' (Madrid 1933). See Asín's bibliography below.&lt;/ref&gt; his adolescent meeting with [[Ibn Rushd|Averroës]],&lt;ref&gt;The elder Averroes as the logical philosopher was pleased to meet Ibn 'Arabi, a respected young student of the intuitive, wise beyond his years. Asín, ''El Islam'' (1931, 1990) at 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; three of his visionary encounters with the 'maestro de verde' [green master] [[al-Khidr|Jádir]],&lt;ref&gt;Here Asín each time provides lengthy quotations from the ''Fotuhat'' which give Ibn 'Arabi's retelling of these events. Asín, ''El Islam'' (1931, 1990) at 49-50, 62-63, 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; and his travels visiting various sufis in [[al-Maghreb]] (e.g., Fes, and Túnez).&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''El Islam'' (1931, 1990), at 60-76 (Fez, Túnez).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1201 Ibn 'Arabi traveled further east across North Africa in pursuit of his spiritual journey, to Meca, Bagdad, [[Mosul]], Cairo, [[Konya|Conia]], [[Medina]], Jerusalén, [[Aleppo|Alepo]], and Damasco, where he died and where his tomb now draws pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn 'Arabi's travels east in Asín, ''El Islam'' (1931, 1990), e.g., at 77-100 (Meca), at 101-117 (Damasco) and at 118 &amp; 120 (photographs of his resting place there).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn 'Arabi was prolific teacher, leaving us a vast corpus of written works.&lt;ref&gt;Asín in his ''El Islam'' (1931, 1990) at 123 n.5, mentions the 150 items of Ibn 'Arabi listed by [[Carl Brockelmann]] in his ''Geschichte der arabisches Literatur'', 5 volumes (Weimer &amp; Leiden 1898-1942) at I: 442-448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The immense multi-volume ''al-Futuhat al-makkiyya'' is the major work by Ibn 'Arabi. Selections are translated as ''The Meccan Revelations'', 2 volumes (New York: Pir Press 2002 &amp; 2004), edited by Michel Chodkiewicz [first published in French and English as ''Les Illuminations des la Mecque'' (Paris: Sinbad 1998)]; Rev. Miguel Asín had translated a few selections of the ''Fotuhat'' in his ''El Islam'' (1931, 1990) at 450-518. Another major work by the Ibn 'Arabi is the shorter ''Fusus al-hikam'', translated by R. W. J. Austin as ''The Bezels of Wisdom'' (Paulist Press 1980), Preface by [[Titus Burckhardt]]. Twenty-seven prophets are here individually addressed.&lt;/ref&gt; Asín functioned as a western pioneer in Sufi studies, particularly with respect to the difficult and demanding Ibn 'Arabi, the ''Shaykh al-Akbar''.&lt;ref&gt;Up to 1911, only one of the 150 extant works of Ibn 'Arabi had appeared in a European edition: a "brief glossary of Sufi technical terms" published by [[Gustav Flugel|Gustav Flügel]] in 1845. [[Reynold A. Nicholson]], "The Tarjuman al-Ashwaq" 1-9, at 1, in Muhyi'ddín Ibn Al-'Arabí, ''The Tarjumán Al-Ashwáq. A Collection of Mystical Odes'' (London: The Royal Asiatic Society 1911; reprint Nabu 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Claude Addas, ''Ibn 'Arabi ou La quéte du Soufre Rouge'' (Paris: Editions Gallimard 1989), translated by [[Peter Kingsley (scholar)|Peter Kingsley]] as ''Quest for the Red Sulphur. The Life of Ibn 'Arabi'' (Cambridge: Islamic Texts Society 1993) at 1, and generally 1-10, in which Asín the pioneer undergoes a critique. Yet unfortunately the Addas biography at 40, note 24, apparently mistakens Asín's text at 37, notes 1 &amp; 2, which does cite and quote to the ''Fotuhat'' [III:311 &amp; I:363] regarding Ibn 'Arabi's young wife; cf., Austin's "Introduction" 17-59, at 46 n.3 and 22-23, to Ibn 'Arabi, ''Sufis of Andalucia'' (1971; 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Shaykh al-Akbar'' or greatest Teacher.&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly Asín assumes the viewpoint of a spiritually involved Christian academic; he sees in the works of Ibn 'Arabi many similarities with his own religion's mystics and doctrines. Consequently, Asín brings his specific, spiritually-informed consciousness to his discussion of the principles and practices taught by Ibn 'Arabi.&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''El Islam'' (1931, 1990), for example, at 5-7 (explaining his title), and at 7-28 (adumbrating his 'hypothesis').&lt;/ref&gt; According to Prof. Alexander Knysh, Asín was one of the earlier western scholars of Ibn 'Arabi, a motivated European clergyman who was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"concerned with detecting the underlying affinities between Christian and Islamic theology with a view to advancing an Islamo-Christian dialogue. Such Christian scholars treated Ibn 'Arabi, if not exactly as a crypto-Christian, then at least as a freethinker open to other religious confessions, especially Christianity. However, a scrutiny of Ibn 'Arabi's attitude toward other confessions, reveals little direct indebtedness to, or sympathy for, Christian doctrines."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander D. Knysh, ''Ibn 'Arabi in the Later Islamic Tradition. The making of a polemical image in medieval Islam'' (Albany: State Univ. of New York 1999) at 19 (&amp; 283-284 [note 5]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Asín Palacios begins his second part by discussing the Sufi spiritual journey, its methods and discipline, and its various supporting societies. Here, Asín describes the distinct approaches found or developed by Ibn 'Arabi.&lt;ref&gt;From time to time Asín compares the Sufi practice of Ibn 'Arabi and the Christian. Asín, ''El Islam cristianizado'' (1931, 1990), e.g., at 138-139 re [[St. Anthony the Great]] (251-356), 141-142 re [[St. John Chrysostom]] (347-407), 145-147 re Christian [[monasticism]], 153-155 re [[St. Basil the Great]] (329-379), 158 re [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]] (1491-1556), 159-160 re [[St. Augustine]] (354-430), 169-171 re [[St. Ephraem]] the Syrian (c. 306-373), 174 re [[St. Teresa of Avila]] (1515-1582), 183 re [[St. Pachomius]] (292-348), 185 re St. [[John Cassian]] (c. 360-433), 187 re [[St. Paul]] (c. 5 BC-c. 67 AD), 191 re the [[Coptic monasticism|Monks of Egypt]], 195 re repetition of prayer [cf. [[John Main]] (1926-1982)], 202 re borrowing of the word [[charism]] (Arabic: carama[t]), 212-215 re [[St. Athanasius]] (297-373), 225 re [[St. John of the Cross]] (1542-1591), 231 re [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (late 5th-early 6th), 234 re 16th-century [[Spanish mystics]], 246-247 re [[Richard of Saint Victor]] (died 1173), 248-249 re [[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. 150-c. 215), 257-258 re [[Jesus Christ]], 260 re [[Greek language|Greek]] [[lexicon]], and 264-274 re [[Christian spirituality]].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Asín mentions the purgative preparation required by Ibn 'Arabi regarding the ''four deaths'', i.e., ''white'', death to hunger; ''red'', dying to passion; ''black'', to endure suffering; ''green'', to enter poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''El Islam cristianizado'' (1931, 1990) at 163, citing Ibn 'Arabi's work ''Amr'' at §109 (p.339), selections of which Asín translated (at 300-351) as ''Amr. La regla taxativa que fija las condiciones que deben cumplir los que siguen el camino de Dios'' [Restictive measures setting conditions to be fulfilled by those on the way of God].&lt;/ref&gt; While some see adjacent virtues clearly when young, and others take first a hard path of trials and of sorrows... eventually to meet a challenging paradox and become humbled in the wilderness;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., ''El Islam cristianizado'' (1931, 1990) at 254-255, which cites Ibn 'Arabi's ''Mawaqui'' [''Mawaqi' al-nujum''] at §193 (pp.390-392). Asín translated it in part (at 378-432) as ''Mawaqui. Descenso de los Astros y Ascensiones de los Místicos''. Asín comments: "Para Abenarabi, ... la tristeza espiritual es la llave de las gracias de oración y contemplación, sin la cual el alma cae en la vanidad e ilusión de espíritu." [Suffering is key to the graces, else the soul becomes vain by spiritual illusions]. ''El Islam cristianizado'', at 254-255.&lt;/ref&gt; yet each soul may mercifully receive a spiritual transformation, to become ultimately possessed by divine love in a felicitous vision of unity.&lt;ref&gt;The ultimate abode [Arabic: ''macam''; Spanish: ''morada''] on the mystic path is "love" [Arabic: ''mahaba''; Spanish: ''amor'']. Cf., Asín, ''El Islam cristianizado'' (1931, 1990), at 199-200. Later he comments: "Todos los caminos, hasta aquí recorridos por el alma, tanto los de la vida ascética como los de la vida mística, deben conducir a este fin último: la unión con Dios por el amor. Abenarabi desenvuelve este tema, con difusión desacostumbrada, en su ''Fotuhat''. (All roads, here running across the soul, as much for the ascetic as for the mystic, will lead to this ultimate end: the union with God through love. Ibn Arabi discloses this theme, with diffuse juxtapositions, in his ''Futuhat''.) Asín, ''El Islam cristianizado'' (1931, 1990), Capítulo XIII, "El Amor de Dios", at 240-251, 240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A characteristic doctrine widely attributed to Ibn 'Arabi is ''[[wahdat al-wujud]]'' ["unity of being"]. "Ibn al-'Arabi is known as the founder of the school of the Oneness of Being (''wahdat al-wujud''). Though he does not employ the term, the idea permeats his works." [[William Chittick]], ''The Sufi Path of Knowledge. Ibn al-'Arabi's Metaphysics of Imagination'' (SUNY 1989), at 79 and 226. Wm. Chittick, ''Imaginal Worlds. Ibn al-'Arabi and the Problem of Religious Diversity'' (SUNY 1994), Chapter 1, "Oneness of Being" at 15-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn 'Arabi has described several varieties of sacred experience, including one in which, having known ''an awareness of unity with the Divine'', a soul may return to the former daily life, yet nonetheless remaining aware also of the fruit of mystical events, conscious both of the "I and the not I", the commonplace and the transcendent.&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''El Islam cristianizado'' (1931, 1990) at 255. Asín later refers us to the Christian experience mentioned by St. Paul of "Christ living within us". ''Ibid.'' at 257. Asín's discussion mentions different levels and approaches, and the virtues practiced.&lt;/ref&gt; Here Asín apparently "avoided any analysis of Ibn 'Arabi's metaphysics."&lt;ref&gt;Masataka Takeshita, ''Ibn 'Arabi's theory of the Perfect Man and its place in the history of Islamic thought.'' (Tokyo: Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa 1987) at 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his introduction, Asín observes that while Christian Spain later became deeply influenced by Muslim mysticism, previously the [[Eastern Christianity|oriental Church]] had equally influenced early Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Asín Palacios, ''El Islam cristianizado'' (Madrid: Editorial Plutarco 1931; reprint Ediciones Hiperión 1990), for example, at 12-13. Also, Asín Palacios, "Influencias evangélicas en la Literatura religiosa del Islam" at 8-27, in ''A volume of oriental studies dedicated to Edward G. Browne'' (Cambridge Univ. 1922), edited by T. W. Arnold and Reynold A. Nicholson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The same year [[Margaret Smith (author)|Margaret Smith]] described this Christian influence on early Islam in some detail in her ''Studies in Early Mysticism in the Near and Middle East'' (London: Sheldon Press 1931; reprint Oneworld 1995) at chapters VI, VII, and XI. (This book also said to be reissued in 1976 as ''The Way of the Mystics'', reprint Oxford Univ. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Islam then arrived in the far west, the Maghreb al-Aksa and Andalusia, where Ibn 'Arabi would be born. From the perspective of [[religious studies]], it might be said that Asín Palacios here presents us with a multidimensional, polyphonic text for [[comparative religion]]. In his other works on Sufi practice, Asín mentions precursors of Ibn 'Arabi in [[al-Andalus]] (i.e., the school of ''[[Ibn Masarra]]''), as well as those who drew on his teachings afterwards (for example, the [[tariqah]] of the ''[[Shadhili|Sadilies]]'' [or ''xadilíes'']).&lt;ref&gt;''El Islam cristianizado'' at 171-174; cf. "Selected Publications" below (for example, ''Abenmasarra y su escuela'', and ''Sadilies y alumbrados''). Valdivia Válor, ''Don Miguel Asín Palacios'' at 132-133. Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' at 180-181, 193-194.&lt;/ref&gt; Asín refers to the many parallels between [[al-Ghazali]] and Ibn 'Arabi,&lt;ref&gt;''El Islam cristianizado'', at 263 note 1, itemizing several with reference to the ''Fotuhat'', and noting that Ibn 'Arabi gave public courses at Mecca on the ''Ilya'' of al-Ghazali.&lt;/ref&gt; both well-known and still studied teachers.

===Varia===

Among the many articles of Asín Palacios are studies concerning the following subjects:&lt;ref&gt;Valdivia Válor, ''Don Miguel Asín Palacios'' at 114-116 (Lull), 116-118 (Pascal), 125-126 (Ibn al-'Arif), 137-145 (Juan de la Cruz, Ibn 'Abbad of Ronda, Teresa of Avila, Sadilies and Alumbrados). Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' at 190-191, 193-194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Blaise Pascal]] (1623–1662) and his notion of placing a wager concerning the chances of reward or punishment after death, with respect to similar ideas in Al-Ghazali;
*[[Alumbrados]], dissident religious groups organized in Spain during the 16th and 17th centuries, similarities compared with the [[Shadhili|Sadili]] school ([[tariqah]]).

[[Image:Ramon Llull.jpg|right|50px|thumb|Ramon Lull]]

*[[Ramon Lull]] (1233–1315), mystic who sought to convert Islam to Christianity, whose ideas Asín discussed in his book on Ibn Masarra, and also with respect to Ibn 'Arabi;
*[[Ibn al-Arif]] (12th century) de [[Almería]], influenced by [[Ibn Masarra]], mentioned by Ibn 'Arabi; ''arif'' meaning "contemplation", although his practice was associated with [[Political quietism in Islam|quietist]] tendencies;
*[[Ibn Bajjah]] (1106–1138) of [[Zaragoza]], known in Latin as [[Avempace]], particularly with regard to [[Aristotle]]'s impact on European and [[Arab philosophy]].

Although Asín carefully followed the leads he found, nonetheless he continually seemed to remain grounded to his core area of research: the mutual influence of the distinctive civilizations of Islam and of Christianity during the centuries of Muslim rule in Spain, and thereafter, and the multilateral implications.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Luce López-Baralt]], her "Estudio introductorio" to Asín's ''Sadilies y Alumbrados'' (1990), regarding St. John of the Cross, St. Teresa of Avila, as well as the Sadilies (a major Sufi ''[[tariqah]]'' located mainly in Northern Africa) and the Alumbrados; and her ''Islam in Spanish Literature'' (1985, 1992) on the two saints (chapters III and IV); and as well her ''San Juan de la Cruz y el Islam'' (1985, 1990); and her "Saint John of the Cross and Ibn 'Arabi" (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Here is the transliteration of Asín's name to reflect its [[Arabic language|Arabic]] pronunciation: Asīn Balāthīus.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Arabic translation by Badawī of Asín's major work on ''Ibn 'Arabī'' (Cairo 1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Ghazali===
[[Image:Munqidh min al-dalal (last page).jpg|thumb|150px|right|Autobiography of [[Al-Ghazali]]: the last page.&lt;ref&gt;Manuscript: Istanbul, Shehid Ali Pasha 1712. Text: ''Deliverance From Error'' (al-munqidh min al-ḍalāl).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the 1930s, Asín began yet another study of [[Al-Ghazali]] (1058–1111), which is entitled, ''La espiritualidad de Algazal y su sentido cristiano.''&lt;ref&gt;Madrid-Granados: Escuelas de Estudios Arabes, 1934-1941. Nine of his prior works on al-Ghazali are cited therein by Asín (at I: 20-21). Work on these volumes was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asín's writings on Algazal are addressed by Valdivia Válor in ''Don Miguel Asín Palacios'' (1992) at 97-102, 116-118, 120-123, and ''La espiritualidad de Algazal'' at 123-125, 147-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Asín expressly declared that the work was limited to a Christian interpretation of the celebrated Muslim and his work.&lt;ref&gt;Asín states that he purposely omits discussion of al-Ghazali's Muslim sources because already adequately covered by other scholars, e.g., [[Ignaz Goldziher|Goldziher]], [[Duncan Black MacDonald|MacDonald]], [[Louis Massignon|Massignon]], and [[Reynold Alleyne Nicholson|Nicholson]]. Asín Palacios, ''La espiritualidad de Algazal y su sentido cristiano'' (Madrid-Granados 1934-1941): Prologue at 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monroe in his ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' (1970) at 191-192, 194-195, probes this approach by Asín, and then censures what it may infer. Monroe cites to a blanket critique of orientalists ("dry and sterile") made by [Seyyed] Hossein Nasr, ''Three Muslim Sages'' (Harvard University 1964) at 156,n1 (to text at 83).&lt;/ref&gt; His investigation focuses on themes of spiritual practice from the forty volume ''magnum opus'' of al-Ghazali, the ''Ihya 'Ulum ad-Din'' [''Revival of the Religious Sciences''].&lt;ref&gt;Only a few volumes of al-Ghazali's ''Ihya'' have been translated into English, for example, ''The Book of Knowledge'' or ''Kitab al-'ulm'' by Nabih Amin Faris (Lahore: Asraf 1962); and ''Remembrance of Death and the Afterlife'' or ''Kitab dhikr al-mawt wa ma ba'dahu'' by Timothy J. Winter (Cambridge: Islamic Text Society 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There are several abridgements of al-Ghazzali's ''Ihya 'Ulum-ud-Din'' including an English translation ("not too literally but in substance" which omits dated material [Preface]) by [Al-Haj] Maulana Fazal-ul-Karim in four-volumes (c. 1971), reprinted in Lahore by Sh. Muhammad Ashraf (2000), and by Kazi Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

British scholar [[Arthur John Arberry|A. J. Arberry]] in 1942 called Asín's multivolume study "by far the most important monograph on Ghazali so far written," but adversely noted the importation of foreign religious sentiments into Asín's work on the Muslim theologian.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Arberry, ''An Introduction to the History of Sufism'' (Oxford 1942) at 53; cited by Monroe at 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Asín, noting the multiple interpenetration of the two rival faiths, felt justified in his course.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Valdivia Válor (1992) at 161. Asín saw Islam as manifesting some similarity to a Christian heresy in its doctrines, given its espoused heritage, for example, referring to [[Ramadan]] and [[Lent]] [Prologue at 15-16].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asín repeatedly commented on the centuries of mutual influence between the two religions, hence his perceived ''bona fides'' in taking a Christian approach to al-Ghazali. González Palencia, "Necrologia: Don Miguel Asín" in ''Arbor'' II: 179-206 (1944), e.g., at 193-194, 198; cited by Valdivia Válor (1992) at 162-164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In this regard, Asín in his Prologue (''La espiritualidad de Algazal'' at I: 18-19) refers to the Syrian Christian theologian [[Bar Hebraeus|Bar 'Ebraya]] (1226-1286), his ''Book of the Dove'', in the annotated translation by Wensinck (1919). Another Syrian Christian theologian, [[John Damascene|Joannis Damascenus]] (676-749), in his ''Concerning Heresies'' discusses the "Heresy of the Ishmailites" at chapter 100 (attribution questioned), Muslims being called after [[Ishmael]] [Ismail] son of [[Abraham]] [Ibrahim].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interfaith dialogue will always have its troubles. "In the dialogue with Islam, Catholics have not always avoided, in an attempt to find shared beliefs and common ground, the danger of 'catholicizing' Muslim concepts and terminology and reading into them a Catholic sense they cannot possess." Cardinal [[Francis George]], ''The Difference God Makes. A Catholic Vision of Faith, Communion, and Culture'' (New York: Crossroad 2009), quoted by Robert P. Imbelli, "Identity Crisis?" in ''America'', v.201 #12 at 36 (Nov.2, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

After addressing Al-Ghazali the person, including a short biography, Asín analyses the teachings of his ''Ihya'' in four parts: 
*''first'', his purgative ascetics, for example, how to overcome sensuality, idle talk, anger and hatred, envy, worldliness, greed, glory, hypocrisy, pride, vanity, and spiritual illusion (in volume I); 
*''second'', his path to unity, for example, penance, patience, gratitude, hope and fear, voluntary poverty, renunciation of the world, trusting in God, and love of God (vol. II); 
*''third'', his way to perfection, for example, the life plan, purity and sincerity, conscience, meditation, and the religious song (vol. III); 
*''fourth'', al-Ghazali's mystical doctrine, to which Asín also provides a Christian interpretation (also in vol. III).&lt;ref&gt;Discussion of the mystical is in Asín's third volume, at chapters 30 [211-268] and 31 [269-289].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asín's concluding volume IV, he translates selections from works by Al-Ghazali (21 titles other than the ''Ihya'') and provides a brief analysis of each.&lt;ref&gt;Included are selections from his well-known ''Tahafut al-falasifa'', or ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John of the Cross===

[[Image:JohnCross.jpg|left|125px|thumb|St. John of the Cross, [[Doctor of the Church]].]]

In 1933 Asín published in the first issue of the journal ''Al-Andalus'' an article about [[St. John of the Cross|San Juan de la Cruz]] (1542–1591) and a doctrine he shared with spiritual Islam.&lt;ref&gt;"Un precursor hispano musulman de San Juan de la Cruz", which was later reprinted in ''Huellas del Islam'' (1941), at 235-304. An English translation was made by Douglas and Yoder as ''Saint John of the Cross and Islam'' (New York: Vantage 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; This work can be seen to be equally about the saint's suggested forerunner, a Muslim mystic from [[Ronda]], [[Ibn Abbad al-Rundi]] (1332–1389); and also about Ibn Abbad's own sources in the [[shadhili|Sadili]] school ([[tariqah]]).&lt;ref&gt;Over half of Asin's article is selected translations of a text by followers of the tariqah's founder, Abu'l-Hasan ash-Shadhili (1196-1258), i.e., the ''Maxims'' [''Kitab al-Hikam''] of Ibn 'Ata Allah of Alexandria (died 1258), with a commentary thereon by Ibn Abbad of Ronda.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shared doctrine concerns the soul on the path toward union with the Divine. God, being unreachably transcendent, the soul's only approach is to renounce everything but God.&lt;ref&gt;Valdivia Válor, ''Don Miguel Asín Palacios'' (1992) at 137-139, 138, citing Asín, ''Huellas del Islam'' (1933) at 249 [''Saint John of the Cross and Islam'' (1981) at section II, pages 12-13].&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereby the soul enters a desolation in which he (or she) lives only for God, yet the desolation may become too severe, causing the soul to despair, so that the merciful Deity grants him (or her) inspiration, followed by a phase of elation; afterwards the soul returns to the way through desolation in order to move closer to God. The doctrine shared teaches that the soul passing through these alternating states of "[[Dark Night of the Soul|night]]" (contraction, due to despair) and "day" (inspired expansion) may relinquish the [[Spiritual gift|''charismata'']] of God's inspiring favors, i.e., the "day", so as to pass more quickly beyond the difficult rhythm of "night" and "day". Thereafter the soul finds repose, wherein to enter the transforming union.&lt;ref&gt;Asín Palacios, ''Saint John of the Cross and Islam'' (1933; 1981) at section II, 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Asín analyses the technical vocabulary used by the sadilis and by San Juan de la Cruz in order to further establish the connection.&lt;ref&gt;Asín, ''Saint John of the Cross and Islam'' (1933; 1981) at 24-27 [in section III]. For further research which develops the work of Miguel Asín Palacios here, see [[Luce López-Baralt]]'s book, ''San Juan de la Cruz y el Islam'' (1985, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

While not disputing these similarities as discussed by Asín, a subsequent scholar, José Nieto, remained critical of any implied linkage between the earlier teachings of the [[shadhili|Sadili]] sufis and San Juan de la Cruz. To the contrary, the suggestion is that this 'shared mystical doctrine' functions at such a level of generality that it will arise spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;José C. Nieto, ''Mystic Rebel Saint. A study of Saint John of the Cross'' (Geneva: Droz 1979) at 25-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Swietlicki, ''Spanish Christian Cabala'' (1986) at 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teresa of Ávila===

[[Image:Teresa of Avila dsc01644.jpg|right|150px|thumb|St. Theresa of Ávila, [[Doctor of the Church]], by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].]]

In a posthumously published article, Asín discusses [[St. Teresa of Avila|Santa Teresa de Ávila]] (1515–1582).&lt;ref&gt;In ''Al Andalus'' XI:263-274 (1946), later reprinted in a collection of Asín's related articles (introduced by López-Baralt), ''Sadilies y Alumbrados'' (1989) at 179-190. Asín had left it untitled (López-Baralt, ''ibid.'', at xviii); now called: "El símil de los castillos y moradas del alma en la mística Islamica y en Santa Teresa" ["The figure of castles and dwellings of the soul in Islamic mysticism and in Saint Teresa"].&lt;/ref&gt; The similes and analogies she employed to communicate the experiences of her spiritual life&lt;ref&gt;Specifically in Teresa's book ''Las Moradas o Castillo interior'' (1577), [''The Dwellings or interior Castle''], translated as ''Interior Castle'' by Kavanaugh in ''Saint Teresa of Avila'' (Paulist Press 1979); and by Peers (Sheed &amp; Ward 1943; reprint Doubleday [Image Books] 1961).&lt;/ref&gt; are discovered by Asín to parallel those previously employed by mystics of Islam. In this instance the image used is of seven dwelling places or castles, one inside the other.&lt;ref&gt;López-Baralt, ''Huellas del Islam en la literatura española'' (Madrid: Hiperión 1985), translated as ''Islam in Spanish Literature'' (Leiden: Brill 1992), at 107-113 (commenting on Asín's article). For St. Teresa's image of the soul as seven concentric castles: López-Baralt, ''Ibid.'', at 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;St. Teresa of Ávila, ''Interior Castle'' (1577; Image 1961) at 11-13 [Peers' Introduction], and at 28, 29, 37, etc. [Santa Teresa's text]; also cf., E. Allison Peers, ''Studies of the Spanish Mystics'' (London 1927-1930), at I: 162-191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santa Teresa previously used like imagery in her ''Camino de perfección'' of 1566, at chapter 67 (cited in Asín's posthumous article at 185).&lt;/ref&gt; Asín mentions the ''Tanwir''&lt;ref&gt;''Kitab al-tanwir fi isqat al-taqdir'', cited by Asín (1946, 1989) at 179, 180, 183, 186; as well as his ''Miftah'', at 183n1.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Shadhili|sadili]] Ibn 'Ata Allah; the ''Tayrid''&lt;ref&gt;''Kitab al-tayrid'', or ''Libro de la desnudez espiritual'' [''Book of spiritual nakedness''], Asín (1946, 1989) at 181, 188.&lt;/ref&gt; of Ahmad al-Gazali (brother of [[Ghazali|Algazel]]); and, the anonymous ''Nawadir''&lt;ref&gt;''Kitab nawadir'', redacted in the 16th century from older material [183], cited by Asin (1946, 1989) at 183, 185, 186, 187, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; compiled by Ahmad al-Qalyubi, with its seven concentric castles.&lt;ref&gt;Asín (1946, 1989) at 183, 186; parallel in number and array.&lt;/ref&gt; Asín draws out other mutualities in the matrix of symbols, for example, the Divinity being in the central dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;At 182, 184, 186 in Asín (1946, 1989). Among other coincidences: the demonic dog lurking outside, trying to enter [181, 183, 186].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luce López-Baralt]] further explores this association of images, tracing the parallel to a 9th-century Islamic mystic of Baghdad, [[Abu-l-Hasan al-Nuri]] (died 907), whose ''Maqamat al-qulub'' [''Stations of the Heart''] describes seven castles, one inside the other, through which the soul travels toward God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luce López-Baralt]], ''Huellas del Islam en la literatura española'' (Madrid: Hiperión 1985), translated as ''Islam in Spanish Literature'' (Leiden : E.J.Brill 1992) at 110; for Santa Teresa generally, Chapter Four, 191-142. López-Baralt later translated al-Nuri into Spanish (Madrid 1999). Also: López-Baralt, ''The Sufi Trobar Clus and Spanish Mysticism'' (Lahore 2000, as translated by Huxley) re St. Teresa and al-Nuri at 75-85, while she refers to Asín's work at 79-82, 85-87.&lt;/ref&gt; After quoting a passage in which Sta. Teresa describes her spontaneous acquaintance with the castle image,&lt;ref&gt;López-Baralt, ''Islam in Spanish Literature'' (1985, 1992) at 91-92 text, and at note 2.&lt;/ref&gt; López-Baralt infers that Sta. Teresa's acquisition of the Islamic parallel was indirect, probably from a popular allusion that lay dormant within her for years, resurfacing later to help her communicate her mystical experiences.&lt;ref&gt;López-Baralt, ''Islam in Spanish Literature'' at 91, note 2; she discounts a possible "[[Carl Gustav Jung|Jungian]]" dimension to the symbolic similarities.&lt;/ref&gt; Following other similar studies,&lt;ref&gt;For example, Francisco Marquez Villanueva, "El símil del Castillo interior: sentido y génesis" in ''Acta del Congreso Internacional Teresiano'' (Univ. Pontifica de Salamanca 1983); and, J. A. Carpenter and Come Carpenter, "La experiencia y la escatología mística de Santa Teresa y sus paralelos en el Islam medieval de los sufis" at 159-187 in ''Actas del I Congreso Internacional sobre Santa Teresa y la Mística Hispanica'' edited by Manuel Criado de Val (Madrid 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine Swietlicki took a new but related direction, discussing Saint Teresa's Jewish heritage,&lt;ref&gt;Santa Teresa's father, Don Alonso Sanchez de Cepeda, was pius and learned; his father (her grandfather) was a "New Christian" or Jewish [[converso]]. Cf., Swietlicki, ''Spanish Christian Cabala'' (1986) at 49-51.&lt;/ref&gt; and her mysticism as filtered through the mutual presence of three faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Swietlicki, ''Spanish Christian Cabala. The Works of Luis de Leon, Santa Teresa de Jesus, and San Juan de la Cruz'' (University of Missouri 1986), i.e., St. Teresa and the [[Christian Kabbalah]] generally at 51-81, re Sufis and the seven castles at 62-66. Swietlicki here is cited by López-Baralt, ''Islam in Spanish Literature'' (1985, 1992) at 127-131, 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic writings of Santa Teresa de Ávila, widely recognized and revered, may accordingly be understood to reflect as well a generality of shared values among the Judaic, Christian, and Islamic faiths during those blessed periods of ''convivencia'' in medieval Spain.&lt;ref&gt;"Convivencia" signifies "living together" in Spanish, and may refer to an early medieval ''Golden Age'' ideal, in which the three faiths would share their cultures in peace. Prof. Asín contributed to the reification of the third pillar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 16th century when Saint Teresa lived, however, was a period of prolonged conflict and discord. For the ''Convivencia'' epoch, e.g., Mann, Glick, Dodds, editors, ''Convivencia. Jews, Muslims, and Christians in Medieval Spain'' (New York: George Braziller, &amp; The Jewish Museum 1992); Burns, editor, ''Emperor of Culture.

==Perspectives==
The works of Asín Palacios are widely admired, notwithstanding criticism that his view point was of a Christian priest while involved in the neutral academic field of [[Islamic studies]]. In his own country, the labors of the Spanish Arabists, to which he contributed greatly, has over the generations worked to favorably alter the view shared by many Spaniards concerning the Muslim period of their history. His spiritual insights into Islamic mysticism illuminated formerly obscure figures and hidden connections. Perhaps, too, along with [[Louis Massignon]] and others, it can be said that the Professor Rev. Miguel Asín Palacios was instrumental in the open recognition by the Catholic Church of Islam as a legacy of Abraham, articulated in the ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' document of [[Vatican II]] (1962–1965).&lt;ref&gt;Valdivia Válor, ''Don Miguel Asín Palacios. Mística cristiana y mística musulmana'' (Madrid: Hiperión 1992) at 14. Among other contributors to this subtle sea-change in Spanish attitudes would be [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]] and [[Américo Castro]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Oxford-Hachette French to English/English to French Dictionary''''' is one of the most comprehensive and recent bilingual French–English/English–French dictionaries. It was the first such dictionary to be written using a computerized corpus and it contains 555,000 translations as well as 360,000 words and expressions. The work was first published in 1994, with its second, third and fourth editions appearing in 1997, 2001 and 2007 respectively. Though the dictionary is entirely bilingual, it is marketed under two different names, one for French, one for English:

*''Le grand dictionnaire Hachette-Oxford -French et anglais-français''
*''Oxford-Hachette French Dictionary: French-English English-French''
Its version is also available in a concise or condensed version. It is jointly published by [[Oxford University Press]] and [[Hachette (publishing)|Hachette Education]].

Its two main competitors are ''[[Harrap's Shorter French Dictionary]]'' published by [[Chambers Harrap|Chambers Harrap Publishers]] and ''[[Collins-Robert French Dictionary]]'' published by Harper-Collins.

'''''Schott's Almanac''''' was a best-selling UK reference book, published annually in the [[United Kingdom]] between 2006 and 2010. The book was compiled by [[Ben Schott]] and published by [[Bloomsbury Publishing Plc]].

In addition to the UK version, the best known (and oldest), two other editions of ''Schott's Almanac'' were published, in the United States and Germany. Each Almanac had a different content and structure, and the German edition was in German.

==The Almanac==
The Almanac presented the world in thirteen† sections: 
*[[Chronicle]] ("''The events of the year, day by day...''")
*[[World|The World]] ("''The four corners, the three worlds, the seven seas...''")
*[[Society]] &amp; [[Health]] ("''From cradle to grave, and everything in between...''")
*[[Mass media|Media]] &amp; [[Celebrity]] ("''From the Big Brother house to the craze of Sudoku...''")
*[[Science|Sci]], [[Technology|Tech]], [[Internet|Net]] ("''The scientific and technological year dissected...''")
*[[Music]] &amp; [[Film|Cinema]] ("''Pop, classical, Hollywood, and art-house...''")
*[[Books]] &amp; [[Arts]] ("''Bestsellers, theatre, fashion, events, and exhibitions...''")
*[[Travel]] &amp; [[Leisure]] ("''Planes, trains, automobiles, and the rest...''");
*[[Money]] ("''Personal finance, from pay-day to Tax Freedom Day...''")
*[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] &amp; [[Politics]] ("''The facts and figures behind the spin...''")
*[[Establishment of religion|Establishment]] and [[Faith]] ("''Royalty, nobility, military, and belief...''")
*[[Sport]] ("''Sporting endeavour and achievement...''")
*[[Ephemerides]] (''Key calendar dates and miscellany for the year ahead...'').

†In the US edition, this number was changed to a total of fifteen sections, with the addition of:
*[[The United States of America|The Nation]] (''The state of the Union...'')
*[[U.S. state|The States]] (''The state of the States...'')
*[[U.S. Government|Government]] (''Donkey'' vs ''Elephant, Dove'' vs ''Hawk...'')

The aforementioned replace the UK edition's "Parliament" section. Other minor differences in the US edition include, but are not limited to, changing the UK's "The World" to "World &amp; Gazetteer", "Music &amp; Cinema" to "Music &amp; Movies", "Establishment and Faith" to "Form &amp; Faith", as well as rearranging the order of the chapters.

The '''Second relation letter from Hernán Cortés to emperor Charles V''' is one of the five ''Letters of relation'' written by [[Hernán Cortés]] to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] by his name in the Holy Roman Empire, and to his mother, the queen [[Joanna of Castile]] in which he relates his trips to Mexico and the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of Mexico-Tenochtitlán.]] This second letter was dated on 30 October 1520.

== Content ==
[[File:4.-_50012_0003_-_Hernán_Cortés_-_Segunda_y_tercera_cartas_de_relación,_dirigidas_al_emperador_Carlos_V_1500-1558_done_narra_lo_ocurrido_entre_el_30_de_octubre_de_1520_hasta_el_15_de_mayo_de_1522.TIF|thumb|Hernán Cortés - Second and third letters of relation to the emperor Carlos V 1500-1558, where he narrates the events occurred between 30 October 1520 until 15 May 1522]]
The letter begins with the headline:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cartas de Relación|year = 2010|location = México|edition = 23|page = 37|last = Cortés|first = Hernán|publisher = Editorial Porrúa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written fifteen months after the ''First Letter'', Cortés informs in  the ''Second letter of relation'' the previous process to the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of Mexico-Tenochtitlán.]] It began with an apology to the kings for the time he took to write; and continued with the sinking of the brigs to avoid his men regret to go with him and go back to The Spaniard; he exposed his decision to conquer the city and with this justified his expedition. He described the power, wealth and religion of the [[Aztec|mexicas.]] He mentioned the meetings he had with the boss of [[Tlaxcala]], [[Xicotencatl II|Xicotencatl]] and the gold that received from the caciques and the [[tlatoani]] [[Moctezuma II]], his impressions when knowing the political conflicts within the territory and his visit with natives of [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]]. Later he noted the conflicts with Moctezuma and his confrontation with mexicas, the battle that took place in Mexico-Tenochtitlán during his absence, when he left  to meet with [[Pánfilo de Narváez|Pánfilo of Nárvaez]], the tlatoani's death and his defeat against mexicas forces. After this, they went to Tlaxcala, where the natives offered him his support to defeat the mexicas. They began to build brigs to besiege Tenochtitlán in company of more native allies, the conflict with [[Pedro de Alvarado|Pedro of Alvarado]] in the [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|market of Tlatelolco]], the sacrifices of the Spaniards, the capture of [[Cuauhtémoc|Cuauhtemoc]], the defeat of the mexicas and the conquest Mexico-Tenochtitlán.&lt;ref&gt;Cortés, Hernán.

{{linguistic typology topics}}
A '''secundative language''' is a language in which the recipients of [[ditransitive verb]]s (which takes a subject and two objects: a theme and a recipient) are treated like the [[Patient (grammar)|patients]] (targets) of [[monotransitive verb]]s (verbs that take only one object),  and the themes get distinct marking. Secundative languages contrast with ''indirective languages'', where the recipient is treated in a special way.

While English is mostly not a secundative language, there are some examples. The sentence ''John gave Mary the ball'' uses this construction, where the ball is the theme and Mary is the recipient.

== Etymology ==
This language type was called '''dechticaetiative''' in an article by Edward L. Blansitt, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;Blansitt 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; (from Greek ''dekhomai'' "take, receive" and an obscure second element, unlikely ''kaitoi'' "and indeed"), but that term did not catch on. They have also been called '''anti-ergative''' languages&lt;ref&gt;Comrie 1975, LaPolla 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''primary object''' languages.&lt;ref&gt;Dryer 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Ditransitive verbs have two arguments other than the subject: a '''theme''' that undergoes the action and a '''recipient''' that receives the theme (see [[thematic relation]]). In a secundative language, the recipient of a ditransitive verb is treated in the same way as the single object of a monotransitive verb, and this syntactic category is called '''primary object''', which is equivalent to the [[indirect object]] in English. The theme of a ditransitive verb is treated separately and called '''secondary object''', which is equivalent to the [[direct object]].

English is not a true secundative language, as neither the theme nor recipient is primary, or either can be primary depending on context.

A true secundative construction is found in [[West Greenlandic]], the direct object of a monotransitive verb appears in the [[absolutive case]]:&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue 1984:130, cited by Malchukov, et al. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

:{| 
|-
| Piita-p || takornartaq || toqup-paa 
|-
| Peter-{{sc|erg.sg}}  || stranger.{{sc|abs.sg}} || kill-{{sc|int.3s/3s}}
|-
|colspan=3|'Did Peter kill the stranger?'
|}

In a ditransitive sentence, the recipient appears in absolutive case and the theme is marked with the [[instrumental case]]:
 
:{| 
|-
| (Uuma) || Niisi || aningaasa-nik tuni-vaa. 
|-
| (that.{{sc|erg}}) || Nisi || money-{{sc|instr.pl}} give-{{sc|ind.3s/3s}} 
|-
|colspan=3|'He gave Nisi money.'
|}

Similarly, in [[Lahu language|Lahu]], both the patient of a monotransitive verb and the recipient of a ditransitive verb are marked with the postposition ''thàʔ'':&lt;ref&gt;Matisoff 1973:156, cited by Dryer 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

:{| 
|-
| ŋà || thàʔ || tâ || dɔ̂ʔ
|-
| {{sc|1sg}} || {{sc|obj}} || {{sc|neg.imp}} || hit 
|-
|colspan=4|'Don't hit me.'
|}

:{|
|-
| lìʔ || chi || ŋà || thàʔ  || pîʔ
|-
| book || that || {{sc|1sg}} || {{sc|obj}} || give
|-
|colspan=5|'Give me that book.'
|}

In secundative languages with [[passive voice|passive]] constructions, passivation promotes the primary object to subject.  For example, in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]:&lt;ref&gt;Vitale 1981:130, cited by Malchukov, et al. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

:{|
|-
| Halima || a-li-m-pa || zawadi || Fatuma.
|-
| Halima  || she-{{sc|past}}-her-give || gift || Fatuma
|-
|colspan=4|'Halima gave a gift to Fatuma.' 
|}
 
:{|
|-
| Fatuma || a-li-p-ew-a || zawadi || na || Halima.
|-
| Fatuma  || she-{{sc|past}}-give-{{sc|pass}} || gift || by || Halima 
|-
|colspan=5|'Fatuma was given a gift by Halima.'
|}

the recipient ''Fatuma'' is promoted to subject and not the theme ''zawadi'' 'gift'.

==Use in English==
Many languages show mixed indirective/secundative behavior. [[English language|English]], which is primarily indirective, arguably contains secundative constructions, traditionally referred to as [[dative shift]]. For example, the passive of the sentence

:John gave Mary the ball'.

is

:Mary was given the ball by John.

in which the recipient rather than the theme is promoted to subject.  This is complicated by the fact that some dialects of English may promote either the recipient (''Mary'') or the theme (''the ball'') argument to subject status, and for these dialects '

:The ball was given Mary by John.

(meaning that the ball was given to Mary) is also well-formed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}  In addition, the argument structure of verbs like ''provide'' is essentially secundative: in

:The project provides young people with work.

the recipient argument is treated like a monotransitive direct object.

'''Sverigetopplistan''' ({{IPA-sv|²sværjɛˌtɔpːˌlɪstan|lang}}, lit. "Sweden top list") is the [[Sweden|Swedish]] national [[record chart]], earlier known as '''Topplistan''' (1975–1997) and '''Hitlistan''' (1998–2007) and known by its current name since October 2007, based on sales data from the [[Swedish Recording Industry Association]] (in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] Grammofonleverantörernas förening). Before Topplistan, music sales in Sweden were recorded by '''Kvällstoppen''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mSkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA48&amp;dq=Swedish+Kvallstoppen+chart&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OgkbUeW6IcWJlAWAvIGQBQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Swedish%20Kvallstoppen%20chart&amp;f=false|title=Intl Jukebox Survey|language=|date=|last=|first=|accessdate=13 February 2013|publisher=''Billboard'', 19 December 1970, p. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose weekly chart was a combined albums and singles list.

== History ==
For the period of 1976 to 2006, the official Swedish music charts were published by [[Sveriges Radio P3]], a station owned by [[Sveriges Radio]]. At the end of 2006, it stopped publishing the general charts, which were entrusted to [[Swedish Recording Industry Association]] in the beginning of 2007. However, Sveriges Radio P3 continued to publish the most downloaded music charts, according to the statistics compiled by Nielsen SoundScan. The new strictly-download chart was called [[DigiListan]].

Since late 2006, the chart has included legal [[Music downloading|downloads]]. On 29 October 2010 the chart became the first in the world to include [[streaming media|music streaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musikindustrin.se/artikel/2064/SVERIGETOPPLISTAN_Forsaljning_av_strommad_musik_inkluderas_i_listan.html|title=Försäljning av strömmad musik inkluderas i listan|language=Swedish|date=29 October 2010|last=Nylin|first=Lars|accessdate=28 November 2010|publisher=Musikindustrin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 14 November 1975 to 8 September 1993 the chart was only published every 2 weeks.

== Charts published ==
Until 28 October 2004, charts were published weekly on Fridays. At that date, the publication day was moved to Thursday, until end of 2008. However, the chart reverted to Fridays in January 2009 for a period of two years. Then, in January 2011, the publication day was moved to Monday.

Currently, the following charts are included:
;Albums
* Albums Top 60
* Compilations Top 20
* Physical Top 20
* Vinyl Top 10
* Classical Top 10
* Hard Rock Top 20
* Jazz Top 20
* Hip-Hop Top 20
* DVDs Top 20

;Songs
* Singles Top 100 &lt;small&gt;(replacing the Top 60 chart starting with week 3/2015 chart dated 15 January 2015)&lt;/small&gt;
* Heatseeker Top 20
* Swedish Top 20
* Dance Top 20

;Defunct
* Ringtones Top 20 &lt;small&gt;(published until January 2012)&lt;/small&gt;

From 1976 to 2006, the sales chart was broadcast on [[Sveriges Radio]] P3. P3 only presents sales data for digital downloads ([[DigiListan]]), tracked by [[Nielsen SoundScan]], since 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9978">'''The Newcastle Programme''' was a statement of policies passed by the representatives of the English and Welsh [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Associations]] meeting at the annual conference of the [[National Liberal Federation]] (NLF) in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in 1891. The centrepiece of the Newcastle Programme was the primacy of [[Irish Home Rule]], but associated with it were a raft of other reforms, in particular: land reform; reform of the Lords; shorter parliaments; district and parish councils; registration reform and abolition of [[plural voting]]; [[local option|local veto]] on drink sales; employers' liability for workers' accidents and Scottish and Welsh [[disestablishment]].&lt;ref name="answers.com"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Newcastle Programme|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/newcastle-programme|encyclopedia=A Dictionary of British History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}} From [[Answers.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Cook|title=A Short History of the Liberal Party: The Road Back to Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1p9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|pages=24–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Newcastle Programme was therefore important for two reasons; first, it gave the Liberal party a [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical]] agenda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Searle|first=G. R.|authorlink=G. R. Searle|title=The Liberal Party|year=2001|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn=9780333786611|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; on which to fight the next general election and second, the detailed 'shopping list' of policies it adopted was innovatory in British politics, setting a precedent for modern political parties. Today ordinary members of all major political parties participate in policy development and the parties present the electorate with a programme or manifesto for government, agreed or endorsed in some way by their members.

==Liberal campaigning==
The Liberal Party's leading pioneer of organised campaigning had been [[Joseph Chamberlain]]. In 1885, he put forward the Radical Programme, unauthorised by the party leadership, as an election manifesto for using the constructive power of the state but Liberal leader [[William Ewart Gladstone]] subverted Chamberlain's efforts, co-opting the NLF for mainstream Liberalism. By adopting Home Rule for Ireland as his banner, Gladstone trumped the Radical Programme, driving Chamberlain out of the party to form the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]]. In the great schism of 1886 over Home Rule, the NLF deserted Chamberlain to remain loyal to Gladstone.&lt;ref name="Little2006"&gt;{{cite web|last=Little|first=Tony|title=The Newcastle Programme|url=http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=30&amp;item=history|publisher=[[Liberal Democrat History Group]]|date=27 July 2006|accessdate=29 December 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001004203/http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=30&amp;item=history|archivedate=1 October 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home Rule==
Between 1886 and 1891, Home Rule dominated Liberal policy debates but two events damaged their Irish allies. In 1887, ''[[The Times]]'' published letters, implicating [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], the Irish [[Home Rule League|Home Rule party]] leader, in the [[Phoenix Park murders]] of a government minister and a civil servant, although a high-profile government inquiry later discovered the letters to be forgeries. In 1890, the divorce of [[Katharine O'Shea]], which identified Parnell as Mrs O'Shea's lover, split the Irish party and scandalised [[nonconformist]] Liberals. The split in the Irish Home Rule party in 1890 weakened the likelihood of a successful Home Rule Bill. At the 1891 meeting of the NLF in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] Gladstone reaffirmed the primacy of Home Rule, but associated it with reforms on the mainland by adopting various proposals of the NLF Council, in particular: land reform; reform of the Lords; shorter parliaments; district and parish councils; registration reform and abolition of [[plural voting]]; local veto on drink sales; employers' liability for workers' accidents; Scottish and Welsh [[disestablishment]].&lt;ref name="answers.com" /&gt; The Newcastle programme was to be the solution to these dilemmas, a manifesto for British government. 

==National Liberal Federation==
Each year the National Liberal Federation met for debate in what may be seen as the forerunner of today's political party conferences. The NLF developed a process by which it passed an omnibus resolution incorporating all the policies that had been agreed in debate. In the autumn of 1891, the Federation met in Newcastle upon Tyne. In addition to Home Rule, the policies, which were crowded onto the omnibus, may be divided into three main areas: rural, religious and electoral reform. On 2 October 1891, Gladstone spoke to the NLF and for the first time, a Liberal Party leader had lent support to a programme proposed by the party's grass roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Spence Watson|title=The National Liberal Federation: From Its Commencement to the General Election of 1906|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nRmPcRdH2gC&amp;pg=PA130|year=1907|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one historian has argued that the Radicals inside the Liberal Party lacked the leadership to ensure their programme was truly implemented. [[Michael Bentley (historian)|Michael Bentley]] suggests that while Gladstone and the Liberal leadership was obliged to listen to the opinion of such a significant section of the party, they were able to slide along without making firm commitments and to pick and choose from the 'rag-bag' of policies that made up the Newcastle Programme, prioritising those they wanted and forgetting those they disliked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bentley|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Bentley (historian)|title=The Climax of Liberal Politics, 1868-1916: British Liberalism in Theory and Practice|year=1987|publisher=[[Edward Arnold (publisher)|Edward Arnold]]|isbn=9780713164947|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Gladstone's biographers also supports this assessment. [[Roy Jenkins]] asserts that Gladstone's only real interest now lay in Irish Home Rule, but he allowed [[John Morley]] and [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Vernon Harcourt]] to cobble together the Newcastle Programme which he describes as 'a capacious ragbag... weak on theme'. According to Jenkins, Gladstone had neither the time nor energy to oppose the NLF programme and decided to swallow it whole just to ensure the party remained wedded to Home Rule as its principal policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Roy|authorlink=Roy Jenkins|title=Gladstone|year=1996|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Papermac]]|isbn=9780333662090|page=581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladstone's endorsement of the Newcastle Programme had one important outcome. A few weeks later, on 25 November, [[Lord Hartington]], the leader of the [[Liberal Unionist Party]], announced that there was no longer any hope of re-union with the [[Gladstonian Liberalism|Gladstonian Liberals]].&lt;ref name="Little2006" /&gt;

==The failure to implement the Newcastle Programme==
The Liberal Party won the 1892 election, but its majority relied on [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Irish Nationalist]] support, and the results were far from the sort of endorsement from the electorate that Gladstone hoped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Roy|title=Liberals: A History of the Liberal and Liberal Democratic Parties|year=2005|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group|Hambledon and London]]|isbn=9781852853532|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new government was unable to enact much of the Newcastle Programme, even those parts that Gladstone approved, because of implacable opposition from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]-dominated [[House of Lords]].

According to one historian of the Liberal Party, the Conservative leader [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] justified their rejection of the Liberal measures including, crucially, Home Rule, on the basis that the Liberal victory in 1892 had rested on the votes of 150 electors in eight constituencies collected by offering many different policy bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parry|first=Jonathan|title=The Rise and Fall of Liberal Government in Victorian Britain|year=1993|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=9780300057799|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Newcastle Programme, the government's principal achievements were [[employers' liability]], [[parish councils in England|parish councils]] and [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Vernon Harcourt]]'s 1894 budget, which introduced graduated [[death duties]].

Gladstone resigned as [[prime minister]] in 1894 and was replaced with [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]] who poured scorn on the Newcastle Programme as the 'flyblown phylacteries of obsolete policies'.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt; When the government's efforts to bring in temperance reform and Welsh disestablishment also failed, Rosebery's disunited cabinet were almost anxious for an excuse to resign.&lt;ref name="Little2006" /&gt;

The Conservatives won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|1895 general election]] ushering in ten years of Tory government. The Radical policy inheritance of the Newcastle Programme would have to wait for the reforming governments of [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] and [[H. H. Asquith]] before being cashed in.

'''The Uncommon Sense of the Immortal Mullah Nasruddin''' is the title of a 2010 book of folkloric stories collected and retold by [[Ron Suresha]], published by [[Lethe Press]], about the folk character [[Nasreddin]]. Suresha subtitled the book, ''Stories, jests, and donkey tales of the beloved Persian folk hero.''

Suresha states in the acknowledgments that he researched the book in part at the Connecticut Storytelling Center in New London, Connecticut, where he lived at the time; the Center's director, Ann Shapiro, wrote the preface.

The book is divided into seven parts, each having seven sections, each with seven stories, according to a tradition that one must tell seven Nasreddin stories at a sitting. It includes a glossary and bibliography.

The book was named a Storytelling World Honor Title in 2012 in the adult storytelling collections category.
