'''The NK Široki Brijeg- FK Sarajevo football riot''' refers to the riot involving the football clubs [[NK Široki Brijeg]] (supported mostly by [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Herzegovian Croat]] fans&lt;ref&gt;ABC Portal "NK Široki Brijeg se potvrdio kao sportska institucija Hrvata u BiH" (in Croatian) http://abcportal.info/clanak/nk-siroki-brijeg-se-potvrdio-kao-sportska-institucija-hrvata-u-bih&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[FK Sarajevo]] (supported mostly by [[Bosniak]] fans) during a leg of the [[2009–10 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2009]] [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian-Herzegovian Premier League]] in the Herzegovian town of Široki Brijeg. During the riot members of [[Horde Zla]] ("Legions of Evil", a FK Sarajevo supporters group) and [[Škripari]] (a NK Široki Brijeg supporters group) confronted each other in alterations which subsequently spilled out to the majority of the town. Horde Zla burned cars and demolished shops while Škripari and residents of Široki Brijeg stoned Horde Zla buses and shot at supporters. Horde Zla also claim multiple counts of severe police brutality which led to the death of Horde Zla member [[Vedran Puljić]] from gunshot wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bh-news.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=176%3Aa-suporter-from-sarajevo-killed-in-siroki-brijeg-in-fan-riots&amp;catid=15%3Asport&amp;Itemid=13&amp;lang=en |title=Početna |publisher=BH News |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305074326/http://bh-news.com/index.php?catid=15:sport&amp;id=176:a-suporter-from-sarajevo-killed-in-siroki-brijeg-in-fan-riots&amp;itemid=13&amp;lang=en&amp;option=com_content&amp;view=article |archive-date=2016-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riotonline.com/blog/2009/10/fc-sarajevo-fan-dies-in-riots/ |title=FC Sarajevo fan dies in riots! &amp;#124; Riot terrace fashion blog |publisher=Riotonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The riots==
There are conflicting reports about who started the violence. Horde Zla accused local residents and police for their mistreatment on their way to the match, saying that the incident was planned by local politicians and that their buses were separated and parked too far from the stadium which left them open to stoning and attacks. They also claim that initially there were only 30 local policemen present, and they did nothing to prevent the violence.&lt;ref name="isn.ethz.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Current-Affairs/Security-Watch/Detail/?ots591=4888CAA0-B3DB-1461-98B9-E20E7B9C13D4&amp;lng=en&amp;id=108850 |title=The Dirty Side of Football / ISN |publisher=Isn.ethz.ch |date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local police and residents said Horde Zla fans were the first to attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/22646/ |title=All Balkans Home |publisher=Balkan Insight |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to local police officials, most of the regional police had earlier been sent to the nearby city of [[Mostar]] to prevent possible violence during the match between the rival [[HŠK Zrinjski Mostar|Zrinjski]] and [[FK Velež|Velež]] clubs scheduled for the same day thus leaving the match in Široki Brijeg relatively ill secured.&lt;ref name="isn.ethz.ch"/&gt;

Some 500 fans of the Sarajevo football club were present during the match in [[Široki Brijeg]]&lt;ref name="isn.ethz.ch"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091007092650/http://www.dnevniavaz.ba/dogadjaji/crna-hronika/ubijen-navijac-sarajeva-vedran-puljic-u-sirokom-brijegu ]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as between 150 and 200 members of the Red Army (supporters of FK Velež closely aligned with Horde Zla).&lt;ref name="sarajevo-x.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevo-x.com/bih/crnahronika/clanak/090922060 |title=Policija tukla navijače Veleža u Širokom Brijegu - Klix.ba |publisher=Sarajevo-x.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sarajevo-x.com"/&gt; According to Croatian media, members of Horde Zla have a history of starting riots in nearby [[Posušje]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skibyusa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3983:video-raspudi-iro-to-u-sarajevu-ne-kae-da-si-tumanovac-kome-ti-i-emir-maete-oi-&amp;catid=46:intervju&amp;Itemid=78 |title=Maintenance Mode |publisher=skibyusa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poskok.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poskok.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18803:sudski-policajci-osloboeni-tuiteljica-potivala-sam-zakon-a-ne-kebu&amp;catid=71:ciroki-brijeg&amp;Itemid=51 |title=SUDSKI POLICAJCI OSLOBOĐENI, TUŽITELJICA: Poštivala sam zakon, a ne Kebu |publisher=Poskok.info |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and that Horde Zla were involved in similar riots before. In September 1990 they had a conflict in Belgrade and they stabbed 2 members of [[Grobari]] (supporters of [[FK Partizan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livno-online.com/sport/13920-sve-poelo-s-qubij-etnika-turina-ustauq |title=Sve počelo s "ubij četnika, Turčina, ustašu" |publisher=Livno-online.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Škripari have been accused by Bosnian media of harboring far-right Ustaše sympathies including displaying the Nazi swastika in their stands on multiple occasions.

31 people were injured in the riots, 6 of them severely.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} One member of Horde, named Vedran Puljić (a [[Sarajevo Canton|Sarajevo]] Croat),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poskok.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18799:orgijanje-nad-vedranom-puljiem&amp;catid=97:novo&amp;Itemid=221 |title=Orgijanje nad Vedranom Puljićem |publisher=Poskok.info |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; was shot and subsequently died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.javno.com/en-croatia/no-vengeance-will-ever-apalliate-my-pain_277635 |title=No vengeance will ever apalliate my pain - Current Events - Croatia - Dalje.com |publisher=Javno.com |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zlatko Galić, the chief of [[West Herzegovina Canton]] police, Vedran Puljić had a record for multiple violations related to hooliganism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Piše: četvrtak, 8.10.2009. 17:11 |url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/sudski-policajci-pusteni-na-slobodu-ubijeni-navijac-puljic-policiji-poznat-po-kaznenim-djelima/454330.aspx |title=Sudski policajci pušteni na slobodu, ubijeni navijač Puljić policiji poznat po kaznenim djelima - Vijesti.net |publisher=Index.hr |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police arrested Oliver Knezović as a suspect of shooting Vedran Puljić.

Oliver Knezović fled to [[Zagreb]], Croatia, where he would not be extradited to the authorities of [[Bosnia]] and Herzegovina, as there is no agreement on this issue between the two countries. He gave an interview for a local TV network, asserting his innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pincom.info/index.php?p=opsirnije&amp;s=70970 |title=The Leading Pincom Site on the Net |publisher=Pincom.info |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the interview Knezović surrendered to a Zagreb police station with his lawyer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/23046/ |title=All Balkans Home |publisher=Balkan Insight |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy revealed that Puljić was killed by a bullet from a police pistol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4761531,00.html |title=Navijač ubijen policijskim pištoljem - ali ne od policajca &amp;#124; Video dana &amp;#124; DW.DE &amp;#124; 06.10.2009 |publisher=Dw-world.de |date=2010-03-20 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knezović reportedly had been shooting from an [[AK 47]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.24sata.hr/news/puljic-je-ubijen-iz-pistolja-a-knezovic-imao-automat-/139147/ |title=Puljić je ubijen iz pištolja, a Knezović imao automat? - 24sata |publisher=24sata.hr |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2013-04-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209093117/http://www.24sata.hr/news/puljic-je-ubijen-iz-pistolja-a-knezovic-imao-automat-/139147/ |archive-date=2010-02-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://naslov.hr/novosti_hrvatska/Puljic.je.ubijen.iz.pistolja.a.Knezovic.imao.automat/komentari/ebjdgd] {{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Citing unnamed police sources, some media reported that Knezović took the pistol from an officer before shooting Puljić.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevni-list.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5471:ekskluzivno-dnevni-list-u-posjedu-fotografija-olivera-knezovia-s-orujem&amp;catid=10:izdvojeno1&amp;Itemid=21 |title=EKSKLUZIVNO Dnevni list u posjedu fotografija Olivera Knezovića s oružjem |publisher=Dnevni-list.ba |date=2009-10-18 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/22936/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019111228/http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/22936/ |date=October 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Knezović said that he had taken the pistol but returned it to the policeman before the shooting. He later came to the police station, but escaped after claiming that the police were looking to arrest him for not only shooting at members of Horde Zla (which he does not dispute he did) but also for the murder of Vedran Puljić (which he claims was committed by someone else.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The policeman Dragan Vujović was also taken into custody in relation to the murder of Puljić. Citing unnamed police sources, some media reports claimed Vujović is being investigated as an accomplice to murder.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Other media reports said that Vujović's hands tested positive for gunpowder residue, which he purportedly claimed was due to his coming into contact with the large quantities of fireworks used that day. Some reports say that the policeman has failed a polygraph test in relation to the event.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Some members of Horde zla were arrested and put in custody. But after Horde Zla spokespeople claimed they had reports that those members were being mistreated in prison the Federal Minister Of Justice Mirsad Kebo had them transferred to Sarajevo and released.&lt;ref name="poskok.info"/&gt; This move was met with disapproval by citizens of Široki Brijeg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://otvoreno.ba/vijesti/bosna-i-hercegovina/27130-budalasti-darinkin-ante-pretvorio-se-u-odvjetnika-agresivnih-navijakih-hordi.html |title=Danijel Srb: Ujedinit ćemo hrvatsku desnicu i promjeniti političku sliku Hrvatske! |publisher=Otvoreno.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190247/http://otvoreno.ba/vijesti/bosna-i-hercegovina/27130-budalasti-darinkin-ante-pretvorio-se-u-odvjetnika-agresivnih-navijakih-hordi.html |archive-date=2013-10-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
===Široki Brijeg===
During the following days many citizens had gathered in front of the West Herzegovina county headquarters. They blamed the violence on Horde Zla. Miro Kraljević, the mayor, addressed the audience giving them his support. The official representative of Škripari read a list of requests to the authorities of West Herzegovina county.

The protesters left after a speech by Stanko Škorba, the president of the Union of handicapped people from the Homeland war. Škorba told them that the ministry of internal affairs has accepted to look into their requests. Although, he said, that does not mean that the Ministry necessarily sees these complaints as valid.

The council of Široki Brijeg also held an extraordinary meeting. The counselors made a declaration denouncing the violence that occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sirokibrijeg.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=910&amp;Itemid=96 |title=Široki Brijeg - službene stranice - USVOJENA DEKLARACIJA O OSUDI NASILJA |publisher=Sirokibrijeg.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191940/http://www.sirokibrijeg.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=910&amp;Itemid=96 |archive-date=2013-10-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protests were repeated the same week. There were between 13,000 and 15,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nezavisne.com/dogadjaji/hronikagradova/47219/Protestovalo-oko-13000-gradjana ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; protesters. Besides citizens of Široki Brijeg the fans of Croat dominated clubs from [[Mostar]], [[Tomislavgrad]], [[Livno]], [[Žepče]], [[Kiseljak]], [[Posavina]] and a number of people from Croatia attended. Representatives of Škripari demanded the resignation of Mirsad Kebo and Zvonimir Jukić.

===Sarajevo===
In [[Sarajevo]], members of Horde Zla also organized citywide demonstrations. They were joined by fans of Velež, Željezničar, Čelik, Rudar (Kakanj), Travnik, Sloboda and many other, mainly Bosniak, clubs as well as over 10,000 citizens.

They alleged that the causes for violence started even before they entered the town of Široki Brijeg in the form of provocations by local residents shouting ethnic slurs at them and gross negligence by the Široki Brijeg police which split them up into small unprotected groups and completely ignored any misconduct on the side of the Škripari up to and including doing nothing to stop the Škripari from hurling rocks at them. The supporters of many other Bosnian clubs present during the demonstrations have also reported that they were subject to similar ethnic provocations and willful police neglect when visiting Western Herzegovina.

They also expressed shock at the fact that as soon as physical confrontations broke out between them and the Škripari, the police started attacking members of Horde Zla in unison with Škripari and other local residents instead of doing their job of separating them. They demanded a thorough investigation into the misconduct of the Široki Brijeg police force which later confirmed that multiple policemen have been aiding and abetting assaults on members of Horde Zla including, in the case of policeman Dragan Vujović, being accomplices to murder. They also accused the police of ignoring local residents who had been shooting automatic weapons at the members of Horde Zla as in the case of Oliver Knezević who can be seen holding an AK-47 while being ignored by a nearby police officer on surveillance footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-novine.com/region/region-bosna/30685-Kako-ubijen-Vedran-Pulji.html |title=Kako je ubijen Vedran Puljić? |publisher=e-novine.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Accidental incest''' is [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or [[marriage]] between persons who were unaware of a family relationship between them which would be considered [[incest]]uous.

The laws of many jurisdictions [[Void marriage|void incestuous marriages]], even if entered into without awareness of the kinship. If an incestuous relationship is suspected, [[DNA testing]] may be used. Some jurisdictions permit offspring of IVF donations access to donation records or to adoption records.

==Causes==
People may be unaware of a [[kinship]] relationship between them in a number of circumstances. For example, [[artificial insemination]] with an anonymous [[sperm donation|donated sperm]] may result in offspring being unaware of any biological relations, such as paternity or half siblings. To reduce the likelihood of accidental incest, fertility clinics usually limit the number of times that a donor's sperm may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9iJlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RYgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2368,2279497&amp;dq=accidental-incest |title=Accidental Incest Risk Increases |date=15 March 1979 |work=Edmonton Journal |agency=Associated Press |page=61 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=coNSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hwUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6125,3788930&amp;dq=accidental-incest |title=Report From A Test Tube Baby |last=Atallah |first=Lillian |date=19 April 1976 |work=Ocala Star-Banner |page=35 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries have laws limiting the number of children a donor can father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/30/international/europe/30sperm.html |title=Spreading Scandinavian Genes, Without Viking Boats |last=Alvarez |first=Lizette |date=30 September 2004 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others limit sperm donations based on family numbers to enable one family to have true siblings.

[[Taiwan]] allows those conceived by artificial means to find out if they are related to a person they are considering marrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/05/11/2003360370 |title=DOH working on provision to stop accidental incest |last=Oung |first=Angelica |date=11 May 2007 |work=The Taipei Times |page=2 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |location=Taiwan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accidental incest may also arise in the following situations:
* Children separated from their family at birth,
* [[Child abandonment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Angelica |first=Jade Christine |title=A Moral Emergency: Breaking the Cycle of Child Sexual Abuse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-F92TlEyr8oC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22accidental+incest%22&amp;ei=-P-HTa2tOKqO0QHR58T9DQ&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwATgK&amp;q=%22accidental%20incest%22 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sexual exploration.

==Notable cases==
*In 2008, it was reported that a British brother and sister, who were twins separated at birth, married without knowing of their relationship. According to the report, the relationship was discovered soon after their wedding, and the marriage was annulled. The case has raised the issue regarding whether adoptions should be kept secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/01/11/twins.married/?imw=Y&amp;iref=mpstoryemail |title=Unknowing twins married, lawmaker says |publisher=CNN |accessdate=23 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://culturekitchen.com/mole333/blog/accidental_incest_twins_separated_at_birth_marr |title=Accidental Incest: Twins Separated at Birth Marry |last=Sabater |first=Liza |publisher=Culture Kitchen |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have been raised, however, about whether the story is, in fact, true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Henley |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/15/familyandrelationships.jonhenley |title=Did a pair of twins really get married by mistake? |work=The Guardian |accessdate=3 April 2012 |location=London |date=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An engaged couple in South Africa, who had been together for five years and were expecting a child, discovered that they were brother and sister just before their wedding. They were raised separately and met as adults in college. Just before the wedding, their parents met and they came to realize that they were siblings. The couple broke off the relationship after the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stewart |last=Maclean |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2057081/Engaged-couple-discover-brother-sister-parents-meet-days-wedding.html |title=Engaged couple discover they are brother and sister when their parents meet just before wedding |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Amethyst'' Incident''', also known as the '''Yangtze Incident''', was a historic event which involved the  [[Royal Navy]] ship [[HMS Amethyst (F116)|HMS ''Amethyst'']] on the [[Yangtze River]] for three months during the [[Chinese Civil War]] in the summer of 1949. 

== Description ==
On 20 April 1949, HMS ''Amethyst'', commanded by Lieutenant Commander Bernard Skinner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britains-smallwars.com/RRGP/AMETHYST.htm |title=Security Check Required |publisher= |accessdate=1 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414010949/http://www.britains-smallwars.com/RRGP/AMETHYST.htm |archivedate=14 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was on her way from [[Shanghai]] to [[Nanking]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Nanking is now known as [[Nanjing]] and is situated on the [[Yangtze River]]&lt;/ref&gt; to replace {{HMS|Consort|R76|2}}, which was standing as a [[guard ship]] for the British Embassy there during the [[Chinese Civil War]] between the nationalist [[Kuomintang]] led [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] led [[People's Republic of China]].  According to the Royal Navy, at around 08:31, after a burst of [[small arms]] fire, a [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) [[field gun]] [[Artillery battery|battery]] on the north bank of the river fired a salvo of ten shells, which fell well short of the ship, and was assumed to be part of a regular bombardment of Nationalist forces on the south bank. Speed was increased, and large [[Union flag]]s were unfurled on either side of the ship, after which there was no more firing from this battery.

===Initial damage and grounding===
At 09:30, as the frigate approached Kiangyin (now known as [[Jiangyin]]) further up the river, she came under sustained fire from a second [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) battery. The first shell passed over the ship, then the bridge, wheelhouse and low power room were hit in quick succession, Lieutenant Commander Skinner was mortally wounded, and all the bridge personnel were disabled.  The coxswain on the wheel, Leading Seaman Leslie Frank, was seriously injured and as a result the ship slewed to port and grounded on the bank before control of the ship was regained. Before the ship grounded, the order to open fire had been given, but when the director layer pulled the firing trigger, nothing happened, because the firing circuits were disabled when the low power room was hit.

First Lieutenant Geoffrey L. Weston assumed command of the vessel, although he was also wounded himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unithistories.com/officers/RN_officersW3.html|title=Royal Navy (RN) Officers 1939-1945 - W|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PLA shells exploded in the sick bay, the port engine room, and finally the generator, just after the injured Weston's last transmission: "Under heavy fire. Am aground in approx. position 31.10' North 119.20' East. Large number of casualties".&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Weston gave the wrong latitude in this report; in fact the ship was at 32° 20′N, not 31° 10′N. This could be an error made by the wounded Weston, it could be a transcription error by the signalman, or it could be an error in reading the logs after the event.&lt;/ref&gt;

The order was given to fire in local control with each turret firing independently, but ''Amethyst'' had grounded in such a way that neither of the two forward gun turrets could bring their guns to bear on the PLA batteries, leaving the single stern turret to return fire.  This turret was soon hit and disabled.  None of the close range weapons could be brought to bear on the PLA batteries.  The shore batteries continued to fire at ''Amethyst,'' causing more damage and casualties on board.

===Attempted evacuation===
Some time between 10:00 and 10:30, Weston ordered the immediate evacuation to shore of anyone who could be spared. A boat was manned to take people the short distance to shore and some men swam ashore.  The batteries switched their fire to the men being evacuated and further evacuation was stopped. Fifty-nine ratings and four Chinese mess boys made it to the [[Kuomintang]]-controlled southern bank, but two men were assumed drowned while swimming ashore. Those who survived were joined by the seriously wounded from ''Amethyst'' who had been landed by [[sampan]], with the assistance of the Chinese Nationalists on the following day.  Both parties were taken to a missionary hospital in Kiangyin where they were met by a party from the British Embassy in Nanking and put on a train for Shanghai. Remaining on board were about 60 unwounded men. The shelling had stopped, but no one could move without drawing the attention of PLA snipers.

===Assistance from ''Consort''===
By the time the shelling stopped at about 11:00, 22 men had been killed and 31 wounded in all. ''Amethyst'' had received over 50 hits and holes below the waterline were plugged with hammocks and bedding. During this time the destroyer ''Consort'' was sighted, flying seven [[White Ensign]]s and three [[Union flag]]s, steaming down from [[Nanking]] at 29 [[knot (unit)|knot]]s. Admiral Madden, the Flag Officer, second in command, Far East Station, ordered the destroyer HMS ''Consort'' (Commander Robertson) to go from Nanking to the ''Amethyst'''s assistance, and ordered the frigate ''[[HMS Black Swan (L57)|Black Swan]]'' (Captain Jay) to go from Shanghai to Kiangyin, 40 miles down river from the ''Amethyst''.

''Consort'' reached the ''Amethyst'' at about three in the afternoon and was immediately fired upon. She found the fire too heavy to approach ''Amethyst'' and therefore passed her at speed down river. She turned two miles below and again closed ''Amethyst'' to take her in tow. But again she came under such heavy fire that she was obliged to abandon the attempt, although she answered the shore batteries with her full armament (including [[QF 4.5 inch Mk I – V naval gun|4.5-inch (114 mm) guns]]) and soon signaled that she had silenced most of the opposition.  Half an hour later her signals ceased, though she was making a second attempt to take the ''Amethyst'' in tow, having turned downstream again. This attempt also failed and she sustained further damage and casualties during which her steering was affected. She therefore had to continue downstream out of the firing area with 10 men killed and 23 wounded.

===Refloating and the arrival of Kerans===
''Amethyst'' was re-floated just after midnight, on 21 April, after lightening the ship, and she moved up river. The Assistant British Naval Attaché, Lieutenant Commander [[John Kerans]], joined the ship on 22 April after he had dealt with all the wounded and unwounded men who had been sent ashore. He assumed command of the ship that day.

During the next few days ''Amethyst'' moved several times, but each time she got under way the batteries opened fire at her and the ship was forced to anchor finally finishing up off Fu Te Wei.

===Attempted assistance from ''London'' and ''Black Swan''===
On 21 April a signal was received: "''HM ships'' London ''and'' Black Swan ''are moving up river to escort the'' Amethyst ''down stream. Be ready to move.''" The cruiser {{HMS|London|69|2}} and the frigate (ex-sloop and ''Amethyst''{{'}}s sister ship) {{HMS|Black Swan|L57|2}} were heavily shelled as they attempted to help ''Amethyst'' and retreated with 3 killed and 14 wounded.

=== Negotiations ===
On 30 April the PLA demanded that Britain, the United States, and France quickly withdraw their armed forces from any part of China.  During the negotiations the Communists insisted that the British ship fired first, but eventually in 1988 the PLA commander [[Ye Fei]] admitted that it was his troops that fired first.&lt;ref&gt;Ye Fei, Zhengzhan jishi [Recollections of a career in the military] (Shanghai,1988), 272–276. Cited in {{cite journal |title=The United States, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Soviet Union, 1948–1950: A Reappraisal |first=Michael |last=Sheng |journal=The Pacific Historical Review |volume=63 |issue=4 |date=November 1994 |p=533 |jstor=3639947 |doi=10.2307/3639947}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amethyst'' remained under guard by the PLA for ten weeks, with vital supplies being withheld from the ship. Negotiations were stuck because Kerans would not accept the demand of Colonel Kang Yushao (康予召), the PLA representative, that he admit the British state had wrongly invaded Chinese national waters and had fired upon the PLA first. Because the communists (and later the People's Republic of China) did not acknowledge any treaties between the previous Chinese government and the British, they insisted that it was illegal for ''Amethyst'' to cruise in the Yangtze river.

=== Escape ===
On 30 July 1949 ''Amethyst'' slipped her chain and headed downriver in the dark, beginning a {{convert|104|mi|km|adj=on}} dash for freedom running the gauntlet of guns on both banks of the river. She followed the passenger ship ''Kiang Ling Liberation'' in the hope that the observers ashore would be confused and not see ''Amethyst'' in the dark. When the battery opened fire, the fire was directed at the ''Kiang Lin Liberation'' which was sunk by the gun fire, with heavy civilian casualties.

At 0500 hours on 31 July, ''Amethyst'' approached the PLA forts at Par Shan ([[Baoshan District, Shanghai|Baoshan]]) and Woosung ([[Wusong]]) which had their searchlights sweeping the river. At 0525 a planned meeting with the destroyer {{HMS|Concord|R63|2}} took place, at which point ''Amethyst'' sent the signal "Have rejoined the fleet south of Woosung. No damage. No casualties. God save the King".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life on the Ocean Wave |first=James |last=Eberle |authorlink=James Eberle |page=93 |publisher=Roundtuit Publishing |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=izzard&gt;{{cite book |title=Yangtze Showdown: China and the Ordeal of the HMS Amethyst |first=Brian |last=Izzard |page=140 |publisher=Seaforth Publishing |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Concord'' had been ordered to prepare to provide gun support to ''Amethyst'' if she came under fire from the shore batteries at Woosung. To achieve this she had moved up the Yangtze during the night, at action stations. Fortunately for the British, ''Amethyst'' was not spotted by the shore batteries and the two ships then proceeded down river until at 0715 they stood down from action stations and after clearing the river mouth arrived at the Saddle Islands at 1200 hrs to anchor and transfer much needed oil and stores.

After a short stay at anchor, ''Concord'' lent ''Amethyst'' sailors to fill gaps in her ship's company and the two ships set sail for Hong Kong. Next day the cruiser {{HMS|Jamaica|44|2}} (flying the flag of the Flag Officer Second in Command Far East Fleet) and destroyer {{HMS|Cossack|R57|2}} took over as escort and proceeded to Hong Kong. ''Concord'' was sent to Japan after being sworn to secrecy. ''Amethyst'' subsequently received a message of congratulations from King [[George VI]]:

{{quote|Please convey to the commanding officer and ship’s company of HMS AMETHYST my hearty congratulations on their daring exploit to rejoin the Fleet. The courage, skill and determination shown by all on board have my highest commendation. [[Splice the mainbrace]].&lt;ref name=izzard/&gt;}}

===Aftermath===
Future [[Governor of Hong Kong]] [[Edward Youde]] was on the British Embassy Staff at Nanking.  At great personal risk{{cn|date=March 2018}} he penetrated the Chinese Communist lines in an attempt to negotiate the release of ''Amethyst'' with the PLA.  His negotiations came to naught.  Youde later was made a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] for his actions.

Also onboard the ''Amethyst'' was a cat named [[Simon (cat)|Simon]].  Simon was wounded during the event and after being fixed up continued to perform his duties catching rats which protected the food supply for the 101 day siege.  He also provided moral support for the surviving sailors.  Simon died not long after the ship returned to the UK and was posthumously awarded the UK’s [[Dickin Medal]], sometimes referred to as "the animals' Victoria Cross".

==Popular culture==
The American ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'' radio series included an episode entitled "'Log of the Marne" (22 October 1951), largely based on the events of the Yangtze incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downunderdvd.com/Suspense.html ''Log of the Marne'' 1951.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614053921/http://www.downunderdvd.com/Suspense.html |date=14 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Todd]] starred as Kerans in the 1957 film ''[[Yangtse Incident (1957 film)|Yangtse Incident: The Story of HMS Amethyst]]'' (in the US most commonly released as ''Battle Hell'', but also as ''Escape of the Amethyst'' and ''Their Greatest Glory''). For the film, ''Amethyst'' was brought out of storage to play herself. As her engines were no longer operational, her sister ship, {{HMS|Magpie|U82|2}}, was used for shots of the ship moving.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12404">{{about|avulsion injuries other than [[Avulsion fractures]]|other uses|Avulsion (disambiguation)}}

In [[medicine]], an '''avulsion''' is an injury in which a body structure is torn off by either [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] or surgery (from the Latin ''avellere'', meaning "to tear off").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avulsion|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/avulsion|work=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term most commonly refers to a surface trauma where all layers of the [[skin]] have been torn away, exposing the underlying structures (i.e., [[subcutaneous tissue]], [[muscle]], [[tendons]], or [[bone]]). This is similar to an [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasion]] but more severe, as body parts such as an eyelid or an ear can be partially or fully detached from the body.

==Skin avulsions==
The most common avulsion injury, skin avulsions usually occur during motor vehicle collisions. The severity of avulsion ranges from skin flaps (minor) to [[degloving]] (moderate) and [[amputation]] of a finger or limb (severe). [[fascia|Suprafascial]] avulsions are those in which the depth of the removed skin reaches the [[subcutaneous tissue]] layer, while subfascial avulsions extend deeper than the subcutaneous layer.&lt;ref name="jeng"&gt;Jeng, S.F., &amp; Wei, F.C. (1997, May). Classification and reconstructive options in foot plantar skin avulsion injuries. '' Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery, 99(6)'', 1695-1703.&lt;/ref&gt; Small suprafascial avulsions can be repaired by suturing, but most avulsions require skin grafts or reconstructive surgery.

===Rock climbing===
In [[rock climbing]], a "flapper" is an injury in which parts of the skin are torn off, resulting in a loose flap of skin on the fingers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockclimbing.com/Articles/Introduction_to_Climbing/Climbing_Dictionary_528.html#f Flapper - n. a superficial injury resulting in a loose flap of skin.], Climbing Dictionary, Rockclimbing.com&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually the result of friction forces between the climber's fingers and the [[Climbing hold|holds]], arising when the climber slips off a hold.

To fix this injury and to be able to continue climbing, many climbers will apply sports tape to the flapped finger to cover up the sensitive area of broken skin. Some climbers may even use super-glue to adhere the loose skin back to the finger.

==Ear avulsions==
The ear is particularly vulnerable to avulsion injuries because of its position on the side of the head.&lt;ref name="medscape"&gt;Davison, S. P., &amp; Bosley, B. N. (2008). ''Ear, Reconstruction and Salvage''. Retrieved January 15, 2009, from [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1288828-overview].&lt;/ref&gt; The most common cause of ear avulsions is human bites, followed by falls, motor vehicle collisions, and dog bites.&lt;ref name="medscape" /&gt; A partially avulsed ear can be reattached through [[suturing]] or [[microvascular surgery]], depending on the severity of the injury.&lt;ref&gt;Nahai, F., Hayhurst, J. W., &amp; Salibian, A. H. (1978, July). Microvascular surgery in avulsive trauma to the external ear. ''Clinics in Plastic Surgery, 5(3)'', 423-426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, J.

==Eyelid avulsions==
[[Eyelid]] avulsions are uncommon,&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, S.H., Bullock, J.D., &amp; Connelly, P.J. (1992). Eyelid avulsion: A clinical and experimental study. ''Ophthalmic Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery, 8(4)'', 256-261.&lt;/ref&gt; but can be caused by motor vehicle collisions,&lt;ref name="huerva" /&gt; dog bites,&lt;ref name="avram"&gt;Avram, D.R., Hurwitz, J.J., &amp; Kratky, V.

''Strabismus, 16(1)'', 33-37.&lt;/ref&gt; More severe injuries require [[Reconstructive plastic surgery|reconstruction]], however, this usually results in some loss of function and subsequent surgeries may be necessary to improve structure and function.&lt;ref&gt;deSousa, J.L., Leibovitch, I., Malhotra, R., O'Donnell, B., Sullivan, T., &amp; Selva, D.

==Nail avulsions==
Trauma to the [[Nail (anatomy)|nail]] can cause the nail plate to be torn from the nail bed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utahmountainbiking.com/firstaid/nailavul.htm Nail Avulsions]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other types of avulsion, when a nail is lost, it is not typically reattached. Following the loss of the nail, the nail bed forms a germinal layer which hardens as the cells acquire [[keratin]] and becomes a new nail.&lt;ref&gt;Rischer, C.E., &amp; Easton, T.A. (1995). ''Focus on human biology'' (2nded.). New York: Harper Collins College Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Until this layer has formed, the exposed nail bed is highly sensitive, and is typically covered with a non-adherent [[Dressing (medical)|dressing]], as an ordinary dressing will stick to the nail bed and cause pain upon removal.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Emergency Medicine Informatics. ''Nail Off''. Retrieved January 16, 2009, from [http://www.ncemi.org/cse/cse1004.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; In the average person, fingernails require 3 to 6 months to regrow completely, while toenails require 12 to 18 months.

==Brachial plexus avulsions==
In [[brachial plexus]] avulsions, the brachial plexus (a bundle of nerves that communicates signals between the spine and the arms, shoulders, and hands) is torn from its attachment to the [[spinal cord]]. One common cause of brachial plexus avulsions is when a baby's shoulders rotate in the birth canal during delivery, which causes the brachial plexus to stretch and tear.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. ''NINDS Erb-Duchenne and Dejerine-Klumpke Palsies Information Page''. Retrieved January 15, 2009, from [http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brachial_plexus_birth/brachial_plexus_birth.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs in 1-2 out of every 1,000 births.&lt;ref&gt;American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. ''Erb's Palsy (Brachial Plexus Birth Injury)''. Retrieved January 15, 2009, from [http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00077&amp;return_link=0].&lt;/ref&gt; Shoulder trauma during motor vehicle collisions is another common cause of brachial plexus avulsions.&lt;ref name="binder"&gt;Binder, D. K., Lu, D. C., &amp; Barbaro, N. M. (2005, October). Multiple root avulsions from the brachial plexus. ''Neurosurgical Focus, 19(3)''.&lt;/ref&gt; Detachment of the nerves can cause pain and loss of function in the arms, shoulders, and hands. [[Neuropathic pain]] can be treated with medication, but it is only through surgical reattachment or nerve grafts that function can be restored.&lt;ref name="binder" /&gt; For intractable pain, a procedure called [[Cancer pain#Neurosurgery|dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesioning]] can be effective.&lt;ref name="binder" /&gt;

==Tooth avulsions==
During a tooth avulsion, a tooth is completely or partially (such that the [[dental pulp]] is exposed) detached from its [[Tooth socket|socket]]. Secondary (permanent) teeth can be replaced and stabilised by a dentist.&lt;ref name="merck"&gt;Merck Manual Online. ''Fractured and Avulsed Teeth''. Retrieved January 15, 2009, from [http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec08/ch096/ch096b.html?qt=avulsion&amp;alt=sh].&lt;/ref&gt; Primary (baby) teeth are not replaced because they tend to become infected and to interfere with the growth of the secondary teeth.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; A completely avulsed tooth that is replaced within one hour of the injury can be permanently retained.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; The long-term retention rate decreases as the time that the tooth is detached increases, and eventually [[root resorption]] makes replacement of the tooth impossible.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; To minimize damage to the root, the tooth should be kept in milk or sterile [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] while it is outside the mouth.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mosby"&gt;Kidd, P. S., Sturt, P. A., &amp; Fultz, J. (2000). ''Mosby's emergency nursing reference'' (2nd &lt;sup&gt;ed&lt;/sup&gt;.). St. Louis: Mosby, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Periosteal avulsions==
During a periosteal avulsion, the [[periosteum]] (a fibrous layer that surrounds a bone) detaches the bone's surface. An example of a periosteal avulsion is an [[Alpsa lesion|ALPSA]] (anterior labral periosteal sleeve avulsion).

==Surgical avulsions==
An avulsion is sometimes performed surgically to relieve symptoms of a disorder, or to prevent a chronic condition from recurring. Small incision avulsion (also called [[ambulatory phlebectomy]]) is used to remove [[varicose vein]]s from the legs in disorders such as [[chronic venous insufficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;Society for Vascular Surgery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15224">[[Image:Balloon Race 10June2006.JPG|thumb|300px|right|A balloon race]]

A '''balloon release''' is a ceremonial event in which a number of [[hydrogen]] or [[helium]]-filled [[balloon]]s are unleashed into the sky.
 
There is considerable opposition to, and legislation against, balloon releases, due to environmental, [[flight safety]], and [[wildlife conservation]] issues. Balloon releases can be done as a prayer ceremony, to create a [[photo opportunity]], to raise awareness of a cause or campaign, or as a competitive long-distance race.

== Motivations ==

[[File:Tricolour balloons released in the sky after the Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh’s address to the Nation from Red Fort, on the occasion of 62nd Independence Day, in Delhi on August 15, 2008.jpg|thumb|Tricolour balloons released in the sky after the Prime Minister, Dr. [[Manmohan Singh]]’s address to the Nation from [[Red Fort]], on the occasion of 62nd [[Independence Day of India]], in Delhi on August 15, 2008]]

Akin to a [[Sky lantern]] ceremony of Chinese tradition, a group balloon release can serve as a quiet, prayerful group activity at a funeral or solemn occasion. Unlike sky lanterns, which float down after a short time, helium or hydrogen balloons quickly rise to heights in which they can no longer be seen. Balloon releases are also used in celebration, as a substitute to [[confetti]], in order to avoid an immediate mess.
A '''balloon race''' or '''balloon flight contest''' is a competition wherein the competitors attempt to send balloons as far as possible. It can be compared to a [[rubber duck]] race. [[Postcard]]s are attached to the balloons which are then released. The flight of the balloons cannot be influenced by the competitors. Instead, success in the contest is dependent on the wind conditions and on the location in which the balloon lands. The contest depends on the goodwill of passers-by to find the balloons and return the postcards. A prize may be awarded to the person whose balloon travels the furthest.

==Trajectory==
Helium balloons are claimed to reach a height of anywhere up to ten kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/surfingscientist/heliumballoons.htm What happens to helium balloons when they float into the sky?- Surfing Scientist]&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is also possible for a balloon, under the right circumstances, to reach equilibrium, and remain suspended in the air for some time, until the helium slowly diffuses out of the balloon.

== Noted balloon releases ==

* 2011: A farmer from Stalisfield Green near Ashford in Kent, England, successfully claimed compensation, after one of his [[Cattle|bullocks]] choked to death on the string of a balloon released by pupils at Lyndhurst Primary School in [[Camberwell]], south-east London, over 50 miles away, as part of a [[Comic Relief]] event.&lt;ref name="cow"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/agriculture/farming/8494881/Farmer-wins-compensation-after-Red-Nose-Day-balloon-kills-cow.html|title=Farmer wins compensation after Red Nose Day balloon kills cow - Telegraph|date=2011-05-05|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2016: In 2008 Radio City 2&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.xray-mag.com/content/bauer-media-stop-balloon-releases-within-group|title=Bauer Media To Stop 'Balloon Releases' Within The Group|date=9 January 2017|author=Rosemary E Lunn|periodical=X-Ray Mag}}&lt;/ref&gt; - a radio station in Liverpool, England - started annually releasing hundreds of balloons (with messages attached) from the roof of the Radio City 2 "in memory of loved ones that we miss at Christmas time." Despite sustained lobbying by the public in December 2016, DJ [[Pete Price]] ignored the pleas and the balloon release went ahead at the end of the programme 'Remember A Loved One At Christmas'. Two leading diving journalists contacted Radio City 2's owner - [[Bauer Media Group]] - appealing for this practice to be stopped. Bauer Media confirmed that no company within the Group would conduct a balloon release in the future and a donation would be made to [[Greenpeace]].
* 2017: A three-year-old thoroughbred horse - 'Espoiro' known as 'Feisty' - died as a direct result of a helium party balloon landing in her field. Her owner Jennifer Birtwhistle (a leading horse breeder) told Horse &amp; Hound magazine&lt;ref name="Horse &amp; Hound magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/news/nowhere-safe-young-horse-panicked-helium-balloon-suffers-broken-neck-615451|title=‘Nowhere is safe’ - Horse &amp; Hound magazine: Young horse panicked by helium balloon suffers broken neck|date=2017-03-20|work=[[Horse &amp; Hound magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "God isn't sitting in his heaven gathering up all this airborne litter that is sent up with messages attached to it on pieces of string. It doesn't reach anyone, it is entirely self serving." 
* 2017: In March 2017 [[Poundbakery]] Headquarters released 500 orange and black balloons. Each balloon contained a voucher for a ‘Go Large’ free Poundbakery sandwich.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://rosemarylunn.wordpress.com/2017/04/09/boltons-poundbakery-pr-balloon-blunder/|title=Bolton’s ‘Poundbakery’ PR Balloon Blunder|date=9 April 2017|author=Rosemary E Lunn|periodical=The Underwater Marketing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poundbakery subsequently apologised on 11 April 2017 and donated £1,000 to the British Divers Marine Life Rescue. 
* 2018: In February 2018 [[Quartz Travel]] announced they would "work with Greenpeace to release 500 biodegradable balloons filled with messages as part of a campaign to reduce plastic pollution at sea." &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.xray-mag.com/content/quartz-travel-partners-greenpeace-mass-balloon-release-promote-plastic-oceans/|title=

* 2018: In February 2018 [[Eastenders]] released balloons during an episode of the soap to mark the death of a character. This occurred three days after the BBC's Director-General announced a three-step plan to remove single-use plastic from operations. "Like millions of people watching Blue Planet II, I was shocked to see the avoidable waste and harm created by single-use plastic. We all need to do our bit to tackle this problem, and I want the BBC to lead the way. Tony Hall, BBC Director-General" &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.xray-mag.com/content/bbcs-spectacular-single-use-plastic-own-goal/|title=

===Balloonfest '86===

{{main||Balloonfest '86}}
A balloon release in 1986 by the charity [[United Way of America|United Way Services of Cleveland]], in Ohio, USA, was a fund-raising attempt to break the world record for the number of balloons in a single release. 1.5 million balloons were released, but an approaching weather front caused them to return to earth, covering the city in balloons, causing cars to crash, and hindering the coast guard in a rescue mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gunther|first1=Shea|title=What could go wrong?

== Industry Code of Conduct ==

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the National Association of Balloon Artists and Suppliers (NABAS) provide guidelines for appropriate balloon releases in order to minimize potential environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nabas.co.uk/balloons-and-releases/#codeConduct|title=Guidelines and a Code of Conduct|accessdate=May 29, 2018|publisher=National Association of Balloon Artists and Suppliers}}&lt;/ref&gt; These guidelines include the limit to the number of balloons that should be released, releasing only balloons made from appropriate material, and that no materials such as ribbons or strings are included or attached to the end of any balloons that are released.

In May 2018 a peer-reviewed study by Delia M. Webb was published that revealed 2,223 pieces of balloon litter were found on 39 beaches across Cornwall between July – December 2016. The study entitled "Just a balloon? A local study of the extent and impacts of balloon litter on beaches” reported that some of the balloons found on Cornish beaches had travelled from other parts of the UK, Ireland and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Delia M.

===Flight safety===
Within many countries written permission is often required from the relevant airspace regulatory authority. In the UK this would be the [[Civil Aviation Authority]], for releases over a certain number of balloons.

===Helium scarcity===
Helium is a natural atmospheric gas, but as a land-resource, it is limited. As of 2012 the [[National Helium Reserve|United States National Helium Reserve]] accounted for 30 percent of the world's helium, and was expected to run out of helium in 2018.&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite news|author=@tdnewcomb |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/08/23/theres-a-helium-shortage-on-and-its-affecting-more-than-just-balloons/?xid=newsletter-weekly#the-government |title=There's a Helium Shortage On — and It's Affecting More than Just Balloons Time August 21, 2012 |publisher=Newsfeed.time.com |date=2012-08-21 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some geophysicists fear the world's helium could be gone in a generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=Steve|title=Why the world is running out of helium|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/why-the-world-is-running-out-of-helium-2059357.html|work=The Independent|date=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, balloon releases are seen as a wasteful use of this limited resource.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
'''Blasphemous libel''' was originally an offence under the [[Common law#History|common law]] of [[England]].  Today, it is an offence under the common law of [[Northern Ireland]], it is a [[statutory]] offence in [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]], and it has been abolished in [[England and Wales]].  It consists of the publication of material which exposes the [[Christian]] [[religion]] to scurrility, vilification, ridicule, and contempt, and the material must have the tendency to shock and outrage the feelings of Christians. It is a form of [[criminal libel]].

Historically, the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were adopted from the [[English law#Common law|common law of England]] as common law offences in British colonies. From the late 19th century several colonies and countries replaced the common law offences with adopted versions of the draft code called "the Stephen Code" written by Sir [[James Fitzjames Stephen]] as part of a Royal Commission in England in 1879. The Stephen Code included the offence of blasphemous libel but omitted blasphemy. The common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were abolished in England and Wales with the passage of the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]]&lt;ref&gt;Beckford, Martin (10 May 2008). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1942668/Blasphemy-laws-are-lifted.html "Blasphemy laws are lifted"]. The Telegraph.&lt;/ref&gt; but the offences remain as part of the common law, criminal code, or criminal statute in various countries.

== United Nations General Comment 34 ==

Blasphemy laws are incompatible with the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR). In July, 2011, the [[UN Human Rights Committee]] released a 52-paragraph statement, [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/GC34.pdf General Comment 34] on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1976, concerning freedoms of opinion and expression. Paragraph 48 states: 

{{quote|Prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system, including blasphemy laws, are incompatible with the Covenant, except in the specific circumstances envisaged in article 20, paragraph 2, of the Covenant. Such prohibitions must also comply with the strict requirements of article 19, paragraph 3, as well as such articles as 2, 5, 17, 18 and 26. Thus, for instance, it would be impermissible for any such laws to discriminate in favor of or against one or certain religions or belief systems, or their adherents over another, or religious believers over non-believers. Nor would it be permissible for such prohibitions to be used to prevent or punish criticism of religious leaders or commentary on religious doctrine and tenets of faith.}}

==Defence==
In both Canada and New Zealand it is not blasphemous libel to express in good faith any opinion on a religious subject.

==Australia==
It remains an offence in some Australian states and territories, although the Commonwealth and some states and territories have abolished it within their jurisdiction. For details, see [[Blasphemy law in Australia]].

==Canada==
{{See also|Hate speech laws in Canada}}

===Summary of offence and defense===
In [[Canada]], blasphemous libel is an offence under section 296 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].  

However, as of early 2018, it is being repealed by Bill C-51&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/pl/cuol-mgnl/c51.html&lt;/ref&gt;, which has passed the lower house, but not the upper house&lt;ref&gt;https://globalnews.ca/news/3512946/commentary-at-long-last-canadas-blasphemy-law-is-dead/&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{quote|296

(1) Every one who publishes a blasphemous libel is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years

(2) It is a question of fact whether or not any matter that is published is a blasphemous libel.

(3) No person shall be convicted of an offence under this section for expressing in good faith and in decent language, or attempting to establish by argument used in good faith and conveyed in decent language, an opinion on a religious subject.}}

It is an [[indictable offence]] and is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s. 296;  formerly s 260 of the Criminal Code, RSC 1970, c C-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  The offence of blasphemous libel, like all other laws of Canada, is subject to section 2 of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which protects freedom of expression.  To date, no court has been asked to consider whether blasphemous libel is consistent with the Charter's guarantee of freedom of expression, which came into force in 1982.

===Last prosecution: ''R v Rahard'' (1935)===
The last prosecution of a charge of blasphemous libel was in 1935, in ''R v Rahard'', in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Rahard'', [1936] 3 D.L.R. 230 (Court of Sessions of the Peace, Quebec, 1935).&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, the court adopted an argument that prosecutor E. J. Murphy had proffered in the case of ''R v Sperry'' (unreported) in 1926. Mr. Murphy put the issue this way:

{{quote|The question is, is the language used calculated and intended to insult the feelings of and the deepest religious convictions of the great majority of the persons amongst whom we live?  If so, they are not to be tolerated any more than any other nuisance is tolerated. We must not do things that are outrages to the general feeling of propriety among the persons amongst whom we live.&lt;ref&gt;48 ''Canadian Criminal Cases'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Rahard'', the Court found the Rev. Victor Rahard of the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] guilty of blasphemous libel for his aspersions upon the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;The information on blasphemous libel in Canada comes from ''Tremeear's Annotated Criminal Code'' (published annually).&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "calculated and intended to insult the feelings and the deepest religious convictions of the great majority of the persons amongst whom we live", which the court used, were adopted from the summing up of Lord Coleridge, LCJ. in ''R v Bradlaugh''.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Bradlaugh'' (1883), 15 [[Cox's Criminal Cases|Cox CC]] 217 at 230.  The court also cited ''R. v St Martin'' (1933), 40 Rev. de Jur. 411.  ''Cf.'' ''R v Kinler'' (1925). 63 Que. S.C. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]]. Offences against Religion and Public Worship. Working paper no. 79. 1981. para. 4.7 and note 181 at p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republic of Ireland==
{{main|Blasphemy law in the Republic of Ireland}}
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], §13 of the Defamation Act, 1961 prescribed penalties for blasphemous libel, but did not define the offence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0040/sec0013.html#zza40y1961s13 Defamation Act, 1961, Section 13] Irish statute book&lt;/ref&gt; The only attempted prosecution since the [[Constitution of Ireland|1937 Constitution]] was in 1999; the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] ruled that the Constitution had extinguished the common law offence of blasphemous libel, since when "it is impossible to say of what the offence of blasphemy consists".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IESC/1999/5.html [1999&amp;#93; 4 IR 485, [2000&amp;#93; 1 ILRM 426, [1999&amp;#93; IESC 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The Defamation Act 2009 defines a new offence of "Publication or utterance of blasphemous matter",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0031/sec0036.html Defamation Act 2009, Section 36] Irish statute book&lt;/ref&gt; which was held to be required by Article 40.6.1.i. of the Constitution, which states "The publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Amending%20the%20Law%20on%20Blasphemous%20Libel%20Speech%20by%20the%20Mr.%20Dermot%20Ahern%20T.D.,%20Minister%20for%20Justice,%20Equality%20and%20Law%20Reform%20at%20the%20Dail%20Committee%20on%20Justice,%20Equality%20Defence%20and%20Women%27s%20Rights%20Wednesday,%2020th%20May,%202009 Amending the Law on Blasphemous Libel] Dermot Ahern, Dáil Committee on Justice, Equality Defence and Women's Rights, 20 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==New Zealand==
{{Main|Blasphemy law in New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]] it is an offence under [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329036.html section 123] of the [[Crimes Act 1961]] to publish any blasphemous libel. The maximum punishment is one year imprisonment. No one can be prosecuted without the consent of the Attorney General.

Section 123(3) of the Crimes Act 1961 provides:

{{quote|It is not an offence against this section to express in good faith and in decent language, or to attempt to establish by arguments used in good faith and conveyed in decent language, any opinion whatever on any religious subject.}}

==United Kingdom==
{{Main|Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom}}

===England and Wales===
In 1985, the Law Commission (England and Wales) published a report, ''Criminal Law: Offences against Religious and Public Worship'', that concluded that the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel should be abolished without replacement. In [[England and Wales]], the [[common law offence]] of blasphemous libel was abolished on 8 July 2008 by the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]]. The [[Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006]] created an offence of inciting hatred against a person on the grounds of their religion.

===Northern Ireland===
Blasphemous libel is an offence under the common law of [[Northern Ireland]].
Section 7 of the [[Libel Act 1843]] creates a defence.

See also the [[Criminal Libel Act 1819]], the [[Libel Act 1792]] and section 8 of the [[Law of Libel Amendment Act 1888]].

'''The Boar's Head Feast''' is a festival of the [[Christmastide|Christmas season]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==History==
===In the U.S.===
[[Oglethorpe University]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] celebrates the Boar's Head Ceremony annually. "Boar's Head is held in the Conant Center on the first Friday in December. It begins with a procession of the members of [[Omicron Delta Kappa]], in academic regalia, carrying a roasted boar's head on a litter. The procession is followed by a reading of the Boar's Head story. The rest of the celebration consists of a concert featuring the University Singers and the Concert Winds, the lighting of the holiday tree and a reception sponsored by the Oglethorpe Student Association. The armorial crest of General James Edward Oglethorpe, which depicts four boars' heads, serves as the inspiration for this annual tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Oglethorpe Terms and Historical References|url=http://www.oglethorpe.edu/about_us/oglethorpe_glossary.asp|publisher=Oglethorpe University|accessdate=22 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330211023/http://www.oglethorpe.edu/about_us/oglethorpe_glossary.asp|archivedate=30 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University of Rochester ===
In 1934, the presidency of [[Benjamin Rush Rhees]] was waning and that of [[Alan Valentine]] was rising. Valentine, a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], helped to solidify this tradition at Rochester &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usarugby.org/player/alan-valentine/|title=Alan Valentine|website=USA Rugby|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This American variant honors a professor and a club at the university each year hence &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/boars-head-dinner-goes-back-to-16th-century-for-one-night-285542/|title=Boar’s Head Dinner goes back to 16th century for one night|date=2017-12-01|work=NewsCenter|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The professor is responsible for the recounting of the tale of the boar, often at the expense of the students enrolled in their classes. The student club honored receives the head of the slain boar, the highest honor for that academic year. The feast has been held in numerous locations on the [[University of Rochester College of Arts Sciences and Engineering|River Campus]] and has settled into the newly refurbished Richard Feldman Ballroom &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;.

The [http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/peace/Ecu-Per%2019981026.pdf '''Brasilia Presidential Act'''] is an international treaty signed by the then President of Ecuador, [[Jamil Mahuad]] and President of Peru, [[Alberto Fujimori]] which effectively put an end to the Western Hemisphere's longest running territorial dispute.

During the 20th Century Peru and Ecuador had fought several armed conflicts as part of the [[History of the Ecuadorian–Peruvian territorial dispute|Ecuadorian–Peruvian territorial dispute]]. The last of these conflicts was the [[Cenepa War]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, General Conflict Information, Conflict name: Ecuador - Peru, In depth, Background to the 1995 fighting and Ecuador and Peru engage in armed conflict, viwed on 2013-07-15, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&amp;regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas#&lt;/ref&gt;

The peace agreement was followed by the formal demarcation of the border on 13 May 1999 and the end of the multi-national MOMEP (Military Observer Mission for Ecuador and Peru) troop deployment on 17 June 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, General Conflict Information, Conflict name: Ecuador - Peru, In depth, Background to the 1995 fighting and Ecuador and Peru engage in armed conflict, viwed on 2013-07-15, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&amp;regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas#&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Concussion Anatomy.png|thumb|253x253px|Example of what happens to one's brain inside their skull, when they are impacted by an outside force.]]
'''[[Concussion]]s in''' England's [[Rugby union in England|professional '''rugby union''']] are the most common injury received.&lt;ref name=pmid25586912&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bjsports-2014-093774 |pmid=25586912 |title=Concussion in youth rugby union and rugby league: A systematic review |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=49 |issue=8 |pages=506–510 |year=2015 |last1=Kirkwood |first1=Graham |last2=Parekh |first2=Nikesh |last3=Ofori-Asenso |first3=Richard |last4=Pollock |first4=Allyson M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concussion can occur where an individual experiences an impact to the head. Commonly occurring in high contact sporting activities; American football, boxing, and rugby. It can also occur in recreational activities like [[horse riding]], [[jumping]], cycling, and [[skiing]]. The reason being that it doesn't have to be something to strike you in the proximity of your brain, but can also be caused by rapid change of movement, giving the skull not enough time to move with your body, causing your brain to press against your skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Concussion|url = http://brainfoundation.org.au/disorders/concussion|website = Brain Foundation|accessdate = 2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With rugby being such a contact and fast moving sport, it is no wonder why there is concussion and other head injuries occurring. With the development of equipment and training methods, these will help benefit the players on the field know what could happen and how they can help with preventing it.

== History of concussions ==
A concussion, which is known as a subset of [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI), is when a force comes in contact with the head, neck or face, or fast movement of the head, causing a functional injury to the brain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Depending on where the location of impact, depends on the severity of the injury. It is short-lived impairment of neurological function, the brains ability to process information, which can be resolved in seven to ten days.&lt;ref name=pmid25586912/&gt; Not all concussion involves the loss of consciousness, with it occurring in less than 10% of concussions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Rugby Player Welfare – Putting Players First : World Rugby Concussion Guidance for the General Public|url = http://playerwelfare.worldrugby.org/?documentid=133|website = playerwelfare.worldrugby.org|accessdate = 2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Second-impact syndrome]] is when a player has obtained a second concussion when you either return to field the same day, or return to play before a complete recovery from a previous concussion. This is a result from brain swelling, from vascular congestion and increased intracranial pressure, this can be fatal to a player as it is a very difficult medical injury to control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brain Injury in Sports|url = http://www.headinjury.com/sports.htm|website = www.headinjury.com|accessdate = 2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Human brain|brain]] is surrounded by [[cerebrospinal fluid]], which protects it from light trauma. More severe impacts, or the forces associated with rapid acceleration, may not be absorbed by this cushion. Concussion may be caused by impact [[force]]s, in which the head strikes or is struck by something, or impulsive forces, in which the head moves without itself being subject to [[blunt trauma]] (for example, when the chest hits something and the head snaps forward). Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or "CTE", is an example of the cumulative damage that can occur as the result of multiple concussions or less severe blows to the head. The condition was previously referred to as "[[dementia pugilistica]]", or "punch drunk" syndrome, as it was first noted in boxers. The disease can lead to cognitive and physical handicaps such as [[parkinsonism]], speech and memory problems, slowed mental processing, tremor, depression, and inappropriate behavior. It shares features with Alzheimer's disease.

In a 2013 interview, recently retired [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] international [[Rory Lamont]] was critical of the then-current protocols for handling concussions, notably the Pitchside Suspected Concussion Assessment (PSCA) employed at that time::{{cquote|The problem with the PSCA is a concussed player can pass the assessment. I know from first hand experience it can be quite ineffective in deciding if a player is concussed. It is argued that allowing the five-minutes assessment is better than zero minutes but it is not as clear cut as one might hope. Concussion symptoms regularly take 10 minutes or longer to actually present. Consequently the five-minute PSCA may be giving concussed players a license to return to the field.&lt;ref name="Lamont December 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/208943.html |title=Players are deliberately cheating concussion tests |first=Rory |last=Lamont |authorlink=Rory Lamont |publisher=''ESPN Scrum'' |date=19 December 2013 |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Connection with rugby union ==
[[File:England rugby union training session DSC 0440 1.jpg|thumb|Rugby Union training session, learning tackling techniques.]]
Rugby union has been played since the early eighteen hundreds. Being a high contact sport it has the highest announced rates of concussion.&lt;ref name=pmid25138311/&gt; Research finding that during match play, concussion was reported at a higher level, and during training at a lower level, but still at a higher level than most players of another sport to receive.&lt;ref name=pmid25138311&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s40279-014-0233-3 |pmid=25138311 |title=A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Concussion in Rugby Union |journal=Sports Medicine |volume=44 |issue=12 |pages=1717–1731 |year=2014 |last1=Gardner |first1=Andrew J |last2=Iverson |first2=Grant L |last3=Williams |first3=W. Huw |last4=Baker |first4=Stephanie |last5=Stanwell |first5=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the game being both physically and mentally demanding, it varies from being at high intensities of sprinting, tackling and rucking, with small intensities of jogging and walking. The position of the forwards consists of them having to have a lot of physical strength to get the ball from the other team, or create gaps for their team to run through. Where as the backs are the players that make the play happen, making runs with the ball, with the protection of the forwards stopping attacks, the backs still do get tackled like any other player on the field, so they have to have physical strength as much as a forward. The Concussion bin was replaced by the head bin in 2012 with the players assessment taking 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rugby is still holding the concussion bomb with tongs in spite of warnings|url=http://m.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/vincent-hogan/rugby-is-still-holding-the-concussion-bomb-with-tongs-in-spite-of-warnings-30952483.html|publisher=Irish Independent|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes and likelihood of concussion ==
Concussion was the most commonly reported Premiership Rugby match injury in 2015-16 (for the 5th consecutive season), constituting appropriately 25% of all match injuries, and the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] medical officer said that the tackle is where the overwhelming majority of concussions occur.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.premiershiprugby.com/news/rugbys-most-comprehensive-injury-study-published/{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A study found that playing more than 25 matches in the 2015/2016 season meant that sustaining concussion was more likely than not sustaining concussion.&lt;ref name=pmid29530941&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bjsports-2017-098417 |pmid=29530941 |title=On average, a professional rugby union player is more likely than not to sustain a concussion after 25 matches |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |pages=bjsports-2017-098417 |year=2018 |last1=Rafferty |first1=James |last2=Ranson |first2=Craig |last3=Oatley |first3=Giles |last4=Mostafa |first4=Mohamed |last5=Mathema |first5=Prabhat |last6=Crick |first6=Tom |last7=Moore |first7=Isabel S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs of Concussion ==
Some of the effects that concussion can cause to an individuals mind set can vary, depending on the circumstances and the severity of the impact. The common signs of concussion can be; blank look, slow to get up off of the ground, unsteady on their feet, grabbing their head, confused in where they are or what they are doing, and obviously if they are unconscious.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Concussion Guidelines|url = http://www.rugby.com.au/tryrugby/administration/ConcussionGuidelines.aspx|website = www.rugby.com.au|accessdate = 2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the things that a spectator, coach and medical assistant will notice in a player. Sometimes concussion can go unrecognised, so from a players point there can be these symptoms; continual headaches, dizziness, visual problems, feeling of fatigue and drowsiness.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These all can occur post game, so a player needs to have knowledge of what these signs could mean.

== Treatment of the injury ==
[[File:Yadier Molina with a concussion in June 2008.jpg|thumb|Yadier Molina receiving treatment after gaining a concussion, with the supervision of medical staff.]]
Once taken off the field of play due to possible concussion, being unconscious, or showing the symptoms post game, getting medical advice as soon as possible is recommended. At the hospital or medical practice, the player will be under observation, if they are experiencing a headache, mild pain killers will be given. The medical professional will request that no food or drink is to be consumed until advised.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Head injury – home care tips – Better Health Channel|url = http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Head_injury_home_care_tips|accessdate = 2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will then assess whether the player needs an x-ray, to check for any possible cervical vertebrae damage, or a computerised axial tomography ([[CT Scan]]) to check for any brain or cranium damage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; With a mild head injury being sent home to take care and doing activities slower than usual, and maintaining painkillers. If symptoms of concussion don't disappear in the average of seven to ten days, then seek medical advice again as injury could be worse. In post-concussion syndrome, symptoms do not resolve for weeks, months, or years after a concussion, and may occasionally be permanent. About 10% to 20% of people have post concussion syndrome for more than a month.

== Controlling concussions ==
In order to minimise the risk of concussion and repetitive head trauma, the method of the 6 R's is used.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Firstly Recognising and Removing a suspected player of concussion, to stop the injury from getting worse. Secondly Refer, whether the player is either recognised or suspected with concussion they must see a medical doctor as soon as possible. 90.8% of players knew they should not continue playing when concussed. 75% of players would continue an important game even if concussed. Of those concussed, 39.1% have tried to influence medical assessment with 78.2% stating it is possible or quite easy to do so. If the player is diagnosed with concussion, they then must Rest, until all signs of concussion are gone. The player must then Recover by just returning to general activities in life, then progressing back to playing. Returning to play, must follow the Graduated Return to Play (GRTP) protocol, by having clearance from a medical professional, and no symptoms of concussion.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Despite good knowledge of concussion complications, management players engage in unsafe behaviour with little difference between gender and competition grades. Information regarding symptoms and management should be available to all players, coaches, and parents. On-going education is needed to assist coaches in identifying concussion signs and symptoms.  Provision of medical care should be mandatory at every level of competition.

== Effect of concussions on brain functioning in later life ==
A 2017 study found that past participation in rugby or a history of concussion were associated with small to moderate neurocognitive deficits after retirement from competitive sport.&lt;ref name=pmid27558141&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s40279-016-0608-8 |pmid=27558141 |title=A Comparison of Cognitive Function in Former Rugby Union Players Compared with Former Non-Contact-Sport Players and the Impact of Concussion History |journal=Sports Medicine |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=1209–1220 |year=2016 |last1=Hume |first1=Patria A |last2=Theadom |first2=Alice |last3=Lewis |first3=Gwyn N |last4=Quarrie |first4=Kenneth L |last5=Brown |first5=Scott R |last6=Hill |first6=Rosamund |last7=Marshall |first7=Stephen W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''De Grote Donorshow''''' ('''''The Great Donor Show''''') was a [[reality television]] program which was broadcast in the [[Netherlands]] on Friday, June 1, 2007, by [[BNN (Dutch broadcaster)|BNN]]. The program involved a supposedly [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] 37-year-old woman [[organ donation|donating]] a [[kidney]] to one of twenty-five people requiring a [[kidney transplantation]]. After a first selection, three people remained. Viewers were able to send advice on whom they thought she should choose to give her kidney to via [[Text messaging|text messages]].&lt;ref name=scotsman&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=832572007 |title=The Scotsman |access-date=2007-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019014800/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=832572007 |archive-date=2007-10-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SkyNews"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1267870,00.html |title=Sky News |access-date=2007-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601184700/http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1267870,00.html |archive-date=2007-06-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The profit made by the text messages was given to the [[Dutch Kidney Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Jeugdjournaal"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.nos.nl/jeugdjournaal/artikelen/2007/6/2/donorshowwasnep.html Jeugdjournaal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930230023/http://www.nos.nl/jeugdjournaal/artikelen/2007/6/2/donorshowwasnep.html |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, due to its [[Controversy|controversial]] nature, had received heavy international criticism in the run-up to the broadcast.&lt;ref name=scotsman /&gt;&lt;ref name="SkyNews"/&gt; In the end, it was revealed during the course of the show that the "terminally ill" woman was, in reality, an [[actress]], although the three candidates were, in fact, real kidney patients; they were aware that Lisa was an actress, and participated because they were supportive of BNN's cause to give awareness to the limited number of organ donors in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/01/AR2007060101471.html |title=''Washington Post'', June 1, 2007 |access-date=2017-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102041251/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/01/AR2007060101471.html |archive-date=2012-11-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press statement after the show, Paul Römer, the director of the program's creator [[Endemol]], stated that the show was necessary in order to get the shortage of donors back on the political agenda.&lt;ref name="BNNPressRelease"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.bnn.nl/page/pers/06/2007/47501/BNN’S%20GROTE%20DONORSHOW:%20DE%20ONTKNOPING%20 BNN's press statement]{{Dead link|date=September 2018}} in which BNN explains that the show was a hoax, and why they did it.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Bart de Graaff]], the BNN founder who died in May 2002 (almost exactly 5 years before the broadcast of the show), obtained a donor kidney in 1997. De Graaff had [[renal failure]] stemming from a car accident in his youth. The studio from which the show was aired contained photos of him, as seen in the adjacent picture. It has been claimed that De Graaff was BNN's source of inspiration for the show, both by the show's host, Lodiers, as well as in the post-broadcast press release.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Criticism and reactions==

===Prior to the airing of the show===
Joop Atsma, a member of the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] for the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], had attempted to censor the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio.nl/2003/home/medianieuws/010.archief/2007/05/120229.html www.radio.nl: Joop Atsma wil donorshow van BNN verbieden]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch culture minister [[Ronald Plasterk]], citing Dutch law, refused to prohibit the television program, although he found the program to be unethical due to its competitive element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Life, death and ratings | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070530.wdonate30/BNStory/International/?page=rss&amp;id=RTGAM.20070530.wdonate30 | publisher = [[The Globe and Mail]] | date = 2007-05-30 | accessdate = 2007-05-30}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the show aired, the [[Dutch Kidney Foundation]] told a reporter "they welcomed all the attention the show had brought on the subject" but also stated that "their way of doing it is not ours, and it will bring no practical solution".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_2121308,00.htmlNews24.com, May 30, 2007 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930202348/http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_2121308,00.html |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press statement, the foundation also stated that they had asked BNN to cease using their logo in The Great Donor Show's logo (note the icon of a kidney instead of an "o" in the logo, as seen at the top right of the page), for which BNN had never asked permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} https://web.archive.org/web/20070625092605/http://www.nierstichting.nl/actueel/nieuws/statement&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch prime minister, [[Jan Peter Balkenende]], had expressed his concerns for what he believed would damage the reputation of the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = TV kidney competition was a hoax | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6714063.stm | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 2007-06-01 | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurens Drillich]], the chairman of [[BNN (Dutch broadcaster)|BNN]] at the time, defended the program and argued that the network deliberately wants to shock people and draw attention to the shortage of [[Organ donation|organ donors]]. "We very much agree that it's bad taste but we also believe that reality is even worse taste. I mean, it's going very, very bad with organ donorship in the Netherlands. We as a broadcaster, BNN, had someone who started our TV station who needed kidneys and was on a waiting list and died eventually at the age of 35. That happened five years ago and in the last five years the situation has only gotten worse in the Netherlands."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2007/s1937444.htm ABC online, May 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the airing of the show===
In a press statement after the show, the director of Endemol, Paul Römer, stated "Let there be no misunderstanding, I would never make a program such as 'The Great Donor Show' for real. I do understand the massive outrage very well. But I also hope for people to understand why we did this. It was necessary to get the shortage of donors back on the political agenda. I call up everybody to get very angry about that, and to fill in a donor form."&lt;ref name="BNNPressRelease"/&gt;

Minister of Education, Culture, and Science Ronald Plasterk told the press he now thought that "the show had been a fantastic idea, and a great stunt".&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.bnr.nl/ShowANPNieuwsArtikel.asp?Context=N%7C0%7CS%7Ceb6ac6d04b496335&amp;newsPanel=binnenland&amp;id=93488 [[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau|ANP]] article in which Plasterk calls the show "a great stunt"]&lt;/ref&gt; Joop Atsma, MP for the Christian Democrats, who had previously attempted to prohibit the show, has called it a "tasteless show", and claimed that he feels it didn't contribute to the solving of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article431493.ece/Verdeelde_reacties_op_stunt_BNN&lt;/ref&gt;

A few hours after the show BNN had already received [[SMS]] messages from over 12,000 viewers who told the network that they would fill in a donor form. The day after, 30,000 donor forms were requested, and two days after the show the official Dutch TV news broadcast "[[NOS News]]" announced that 50,000 people had requested a donor form to be sent to them, a figure that is expected to still rise. In July, a month after the show aired, 7,300 new donors were registered by the Dutch donor registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.nu.nl/news/1155955/10/Donorshow_levert_duizenden_extra_donoren_op_%28video%29.html Published numbers in the press]&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurens Drillich, BNN's chairman, told the press "It was very hard to keep this a secret, and to tell this lie time after time, but I did it because of the good cause."{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

====Dutch TV moment of the year 2007====
On January 12, 2008, the scene during which [[Patrick Lodiers]] revealed that the show was a hoax with the purpose of drawing attention to the Dutch donor shortage problem was voted as the best Dutch TV moment of the year 2007. During a brief speech, the chairman of [[BNN (Dutch broadcaster)|BNN]], [[Laurens Drillich]], said the following: "The show was aired in June, today is January. Dutch politicians promised to put donor shortage on their agenda. We're still waiting for a reaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.nu.nl/news/1388708/60/Donorshow_en_Halal_Het_TV-Moment_Van_Het_Jaar.html Donor show voted TV moment of the year 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Awards====
The show won a 2008 [[International Emmy]] for non-scripted entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7747319.stm | work=BBC News | title=British talent dominates at Emmys | date=November 25, 2008 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released in 2014, '''''Ekaterina''''' is a [[Russia-1]] historical television [[biographical film]] starring [[Marina Aleksandrova]] as the eventual Russian empress [[Catherine the Great]]. The first season tells the story of princess Sophie Friederike Auguste, and her rise to power to become [[Emperor of All Russia|Empress of Russia]], following a coup d'état and the assassination of her husband, [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]]. The second season portrays the challenges she faces at home and abroad during the early years of her rule, as she tries to revitalise Russia to become one of the great powers of Europe, and becomes titled 'the Great'. This drama also aired in [[Pakistan]] on [[filmazia]], dubbed in [[Urdu]].

The first season premiered on November 24, 2014 on Channel [[Russia-1]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://russia.tv/brand/show/brand_id/58458 Catherine] on [[Russia-1]] official website&lt;/ref&gt;, and was released on Amazon in 2017 under the title '''Ekaterina: The Rise of Catherine the Great'''. The second season premiered on [[Russia-1]] on 27 February 2017, and was released on Amazon in 2018.

During the broadcast, the series held the top spot for film and television series ratings in Russia, and became one of the most popular TV series in [[Russian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=2157007  "Екатерины": сериал лидирует среди телепроектов недели] (Russian report)&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, Marina Aleksandrova has confirmed on her Instagram account that they are currently filming a third season.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/Bn1PlQEhyVG/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
In 1745 in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]] is childless, and she appoints her nephew [[Peter III of Russia|Peter Fedorovich]] as the heir to Russian throne.   But he had been born in [[Prussia]], and could hardly speak Russian.

Elizabeth decides to marry him to a princess, intending to take any future son and educate him to become the future emperor. Elizabeth chooses a wife for her nephew, German Princess Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg. Sophia Frederike is sent to a distant and foreign land hoping to find happiness, but is faced with the intrigues and plots of the Russian Imperial court, the indifference of her spouse, and the diabolical plans of the Empress. The girl takes the name Catherine Alexeevna (Yekaterina) and works to save herself and her children from deadly danger, as the emperor [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] desires to send her away from the palace.

In July 1762, barely six months after becoming emperor, Peter commits the political error of retiring with his Holstein-born courtiers and relatives to Oranienbaum, leaving his wife in Saint Petersburg. On July 8 and 9, the Leib Guard revolts, deposes Peter from power, and proclaims Catherine as the new monarch. The bloodless coup d'état succeeds and Catherine becomes the new empress, and thus the Catherinian Era and the [[Golden Age]] of the [[Russian Empire]] begins.

==Reception==

The series has received praise for its acting and costume design, and the first season won Russia's Golden Eagle award for 'best television series'.  A review at Eclectic Pop described it as "a vivid and beautifully crafted series replete with lavish costumes and a stirring musical score"&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.eclecticpop.com/2017/09/ekaterina-rise-of-catherine-great-2014.html|title=EKATERINA: THE RISE OF CATHERINE THE GREAT' (2014) SEASON 1 REVIEW|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Writing for Broadway World, Robert Kahn described the series as "gloriously filmed" and added that: "The story of Catherine's  rise to power rivals any contemporary soap opera, as an intricate web of politics, adultery and betrayal unfolds within the Russian court in spectacular fashion."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url= https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwgeeks/article/Ekaterina--The-Rise-of-Catherine-the-Great-now-streaming-on-Amazon-Prime-Video-20170627 |accessdate= 2 November 2017 |title= Ekaterina - The Rise of Catherine the Great, now streaming on Amazon Prime Video |first= Robert |last= Kahn |date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Russia Insider]] wrote that the "production level is really first rate, reflecting great depth of talent and experience in Russian film-making".&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url= http://russia-insider.com/en/politics/amazon-video-debuts-excellent-russian-tv-series-about-catherine-great/ri20302 |title= Amazon Video Debuts Excellent Russian TV Series About Catherine the Great |accessdate= 2 November 2017 |date= 13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Battles involving Assyria}}
The '''Fall of Harran''' refers to the [[Median]] and [[Babylonia]]n siege and capture of the [[Assyria]]n city of [[Harran]] in 610 BC.

==Background==
The Assyrians, from the year 639 BCE, had been suffering from a decline in their power, culminating in Neo-Babylonian and Median invasions of their lands. The city of [[Arrapha]] fell in 615 BCE, followed by [[Assur]] in 614 BCE, and finally the famed [[Nineveh]], the newest capital of Assyria, in 612 BCE. Despite the brutal massacres that followed, the Assyrians survived as a political entity and escaped to Harran under their new king, [[Ashur-uballit II]].&lt;ref name="Bertman1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=New York|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing Harran as a capital for the Assyrians caught the attention of the Babylonian King [[Nabopolassar]]&lt;ref name="Bertman1"/&gt; and Median King [[Cyaxares]], who were determined to destroy forever the threat of Assyrian resurgence.

==Siege==
Assyrian annals record no more after 610 BC&lt;ref name="Bertman1"/&gt; - the presumed date of the siege. The siege lasted for another year before the city finally fell in 609 BC.&lt;ref name="Grant1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=R.G.|title=Battle: A Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat|location=London|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=2005|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not much is known of the siege - it is presumed that Ashur-uballit II was killed in the battle.

==Aftermath==
After this last reverse, the Assyrian empire does not exist as a state, remnants of the former Assyrian empire's army met up with the Egyptian forces that had won at [[Battle of Megiddo (609 BC)|Megiddo]]. In 605 BC, the Babylonians were again successful, as they defeated Egyptians along with part of the army of the former Assyria at [[Battle of Carchemish|Carchemish]], ending the Egyptian intervention in the [[Near East]].

'''''Film Fun''''' was a British [[celebrity comics]] [[comic book]] that ran from (issues dates) 17 January 1920 to 15 September 1962, when it merged with ''[[Buster (comic)|Buster]]'', a total of 2225 issues. There were also annuals in the forties and fifties. It was renamed ''Film Fun and Thrills'' in 1959. As the title suggests, the comic mainly featured [[comic strip]] versions of people from [[film]]s from the 1920s to the 1960s. Pre-war circulation at its peak was around 800,000 copies per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicpriceguide.co.uk/uk_comic.php?tc=filmfun |title=The Comic Book Price Guide For Great Britain - FILM FUN |publisher=Comicpriceguide.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover of the first edition featured [[Harold Lloyd]] but named as "Winkle", the screen name by which he was known in Britain at the time.

==Eddie the Happy Editor==
[[Frederick George Cordwell]] was better known to ''Film Fun'' fans as Eddie the Happy Editor. Cordwell edited the comic until his death in 1949, aged 62 in Richmond, Surrey. Cordwell wrote many scripts for the strips as well as text stories for ''Film Fun''. He introduced the idea of characters receiving huge plates of [[bangers and mash]], giant [[Christmas pudding]]s, pies and such from grateful beneficiaries of their efforts. Cordwell even made it into the stories himself, meeting [[Laurel and Hardy]] a number of times, [[Joe E Brown]], [[Wheeler and Woolsey]] and other characters.

==Mergers==
''[[Picture Fun]]'' merged with ''Film Fun'' soon after its launch in 1920, followed by ''[[Kinema Comic]]'' in 1932, ''[[Film Picture Stories]]'' in 1935, ''[[Illustrated Chips]]'' in 1953 and ''[[Top Spot (comics)|Top Spot]]'' in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lew Stringer |url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2011/01/top-spot-clint-of-1958.html |title=Blimey!

==Content==
Apart from [[Laurel and Hardy]], ''Film Fun'' used to feature many film and stage comedians of that era like [[Charlie Chaplin]],&lt;ref name="lambiek.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/wakefield_t.htm|title=Terence Wakefield|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abbot and Costello]],&lt;ref name="lambiek.net1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/ward_norman.htm|title=Norman Yendell Ward|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lambiek.net2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/bell_walter.htm|title=Walter Bell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buster Keaton]], [[Ben Turpin]],&lt;ref name="lambiek.net3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/wakefield_gw.htm|title=George William Wakefield|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jackie Coogan]], [[Fatty Arbuckle]],&lt;ref name="lambiek.net3"/&gt; [[Joe E.

'''Garsington Opera''' is an annual summer [[list of opera festivals|opera festival]] founded in 1989 by [[Leonard Ingrams]]. For 21 years it was held in the gardens of Ingrams's home at [[Garsington Manor]] in Oxfordshire. Since 2011 the festival is held in [[Wormsley Park]], the home of the [[Getty family]] near [[Stokenchurch]] in Buckinghamshire, England. After Ingrams's death in 2005 [[Anthony Whitworth-Jones]] became its General Director until 2013 when [[Douglas Boyd]] became Artistic Director.

== Opera at Garsington ==
A characteristic feature of Garsington Opera's programming has been the combination of well known operas with discoveries of little known works. These have included the British premieres of Richard Strauss' ''[[Die ägyptische Helena]]'', Rossini's ''[[La gazzetta]]'' and ''[[L'equivoco stravagante]]'', and [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]]'s ''[[L'incoronazione di Dario]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Church, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/preview-liioronazione-di-dario-garsington-manor-oxford-838059.html A royal opera to Garsington manor is born], ''[[The Independent]]'', 2 June 2008. Retrieved 2 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival also gave the first British professional productions of Haydn's ''[[La vera costanza]]'', Strauss' ''[[Die Liebe der Danae]]'', Janáček's ''[[Šárka (Janáček)|Šárka]]'', and Tchaikovsky's ''[[Cherevichki]]''.

Performances take place in the specially designed seasonal Opera Pavilion from within which it is possible to view the surrounding landscape. This maintains the link with the outside, a tradition at Garsington Opera. The performances begin in the early evening, allowing for a long dinner during the interval, similar to [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]], and evening dress is suggested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://glyndebourne.com/what-wear Glyndebourne Festival Opera Visitors' Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510223723/http://glyndebourne.com/what-wear |date=10 May 2011 }}; [http://www.garsingtonopera.org/your-visit/your-evening Garsington Opera Visitors' Information]&lt;/ref&gt; Operas are often performed in their original language with English [[surtitles]]. In 2017 the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] became a resident orchestra at the Festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2014/garsington-opera-announces-new-partnerships-rsc-philharmonia-orchestra/|title=Garsington Opera partners with RSC and Philharmonia Orchestra {{!}} News {{!}} The Stage|date=2014-05-28|work=The Stage|access-date=2018-08-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; playing for one production per season, with the Garsington Opera Orchestra continuing to play three productions per year.

==History==

===Garsington Manor===
[[Image:Garsington Manor By Henry Taunt.jpg| thumb|250px|right|Garsington Manor photographed in 1865 by [[Henry Taunt]]]]
In 1982, financier [[Leonard Ingrams]] (brother of [[Richard Ingrams]], the founder of ''[[Private Eye]]'') and his wife Rosalind bought [[Garsington Manor]] and soon realised the opportunities it offered for outdoor performance. The family became well known for organising this annual season of opera in the manor gardens.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1495450/Leonard-Ingrams.html Obituary: Leonard Ingrams]. 8 April 2005. Retrieved 2 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garsington Manor saw its opera first performance in 1989 when [[Opera 80]] performed ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'' in aid of the [[Oxford Playhouse]]. The success of the performance led to the founding of Garsington Opera soon afterwards by Leonard Ingrams. In 1990, the company's first season comprised [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' and the British premiere of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s ''[[Orlando paladino]]''. Ingrams asked the Guildhall Strings to play for his new company, and within a few years Garsington Opera had its own orchestra whose core remained the Guildhall Strings. Within four years, Garsington Opera started staging three different productions of different operas. This format remains the same today. At the same time it began presenting complete four-week seasons on its own.

Ingrams also used the barn at Garsington Manor for an annual series of chamber music concerts. He installed into the barn the panelling from the old auditorium at Glyndebourne which was then being thrown out when the new auditorium at Glyndebourne was built. The barn was also used as the restaurant during the opera season, and opera guests could dine in it during the interval. The operas were performed on the stone loggia which overlooks the seried flower garden, designed and planted by [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] when she owned the Manor during and after the First World War and entertained her famous [[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury]] guests there e.g. [[T. S. Eliot|T.S. Eliot]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Bertrand Russell|Betrand Russell]], [[W. B. Yeats|W.B.Yeats]]. 

As demand for the opera rapidly grew Ingrams commissioned a purpose-built auditorium seating around 500 people by project architect Robin Snell. The auditorium was noted for its natural acoustic and good sight-lines. The stage was partly covered by a [[PVC]] fabric canopy completed in 1995 but was open to the gardens behind. Each year at the end of the season the entire edifice was dismantled and the fabric returned to Architen Landrell, the canopy's designers, for maintenance and storage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architen.com/projects/garsington-opera-house Garsington Opera House] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707155946/http://www.architen.com/projects/garsington-opera-house |date=7 July 2011 }}, Architen Landrell. Retrieved 2 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sound-proofing screens were later erected around the theatre in response to complaints from a group of Garsington residents living near the Manor. In 1996, they won [[Pound sterling|£]]1,000 compensation for noise disturbance caused by the operas. When the award was overturned on appeal, local resident Monica Waud led her neighbours in a [[civil disobedience]] campaign during the 1997 performance of Haydn's ''[[Le pescatrici|Le Pescatrici]]''. The protesters simultaneously began cutting their lawns with electric lawnmowers and diesel tractors, trimming their hedges, and turning on their hoses. Car alarms were set off and as a grand finale a private plane piloted by Miss Waud's companion flew overhead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Lyall]], [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EED81F30F934A35754C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print From the Opera's Neighbors, a Reply (Fortissimo)], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 7 July 1997. Retrieved 2 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the protesters tried unsuccessfully to use the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] to block Garsington Opera performances, claiming that they denied them the right to the "peaceful enjoyment of their possessions".&lt;ref&gt;Chris Walker, [http://www.oxfordmail.net/news/headlines/display.var.2244866.0.garsington_opera_must_move.php Garsington Opera must move], ''The Oxford Mail'', 2 May 2008. Retrieved 2 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The South [[Oxfordshire]] environmental health service undertook in-house monitoring of opera performances in each season from 2000 through 2005, but on each occasion concluded that there was no statutory noise nuisance.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Coxell (Head of Environmental Health), [https://web.archive.org/web/20110902180006/http://ww2.southoxon.gov.uk/gw/webpub/dm8mmbRickrbqq1Hi1/GWDOC/DREF/sodc.docaccesspo1.public/4183/Official/webacc/GWContentRoot?action=Document.View&amp;User.html= Acoustic report for Garsington Opera (2005 season)], South Oxfordshire District Council, 8 December 2005. Retrieved 2 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard Ingrams died from a heart attack on 27 July 2005 at the age of 63. In November of that year, Garsington Opera announced that it would continue, following the appointment of [[Anthony Whitworth-Jones]] as General Director.  Rosalind Ingrams (Leonard's widow) became President. Anthony Whitworth-Jones had been General Director of the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]] from 1989 to 1998 and of the [[Dallas Opera]] from 2000 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rupert Christiansen]], [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/05/31/bmgars131.xml Where opera soars in harmony with nature], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 31 May 2007. Retrieved 2 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitworth-Jones noted that "under Leonard Ingrams' passionate leadership, (it) has established a reputation for musical excellence, the presentation of some fascinating operatic rarities and the promotion of young singers.

In 2006 Leonard's pre-planned and pre-cast repertoire was overseen by Anthony Whitworth-Jones during his first year as artistic director, and the company performed [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[May Night|Mayskaja Noch]]'', [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[Don Pasquale]]'', and ''[[Der Stein der Weisen]]'' (''The Philosopher's Stone''), a collaborative work by [[Emanuel Schikaneder]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and other members of Mozart's circle.  In 2007, the Metropolitan Opera in New York staged Garsington's production of ''[[Die ägyptische Helena|Die agyptische Helena]]'', which Leonard Ingrams had put on in 1997. In April 2008, when it became clear that the opera needed more space, the Ingrams family gave notice that the Manor would not be able to host performances after the 2010 season, although the family would continue its support for the company.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Bloxham, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1915908/Opera-festival-has-to-find-new-stage.html Opera festival has to find new stage], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 1 May 2008.

===Wormsley Park===
[[File:Garsington Opera at Wormsley.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Garsington Opera Pavilion at [[Wormsley Park|Wormsley]]]]Garsington Opera announced in April 2010 that it had reached agreement with the [[Getty family]] to hold the opera festival at [[Wormsley Park]]. The company's new performing space is a 600-seat pavilion, which like that at Garsington Manor is designed to be put up and dismantled each season. The first season at Wormsley Park saw the performance of Vivaldi's ''[[La verità in cimento]]'' in its British premiere, Mozart's ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' and Rossini's ''[[Il turco in Italia]]''. The company is now financed by The Friends of Garsington Opera, corporate and private sponsorship, and the support of foundations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rupert Christiansen|Christiansen, Rupert]].

For the background information, causes, effects and policy responses see [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]]. For a timeline see [[Subprime crisis impact timeline]].

==Beginning of October==
The policy response to the subprime crisis started in earnest after Lehman’s failure in mid September 2008, accelerated after February 2009, and had become very large by September 2009. Governments have relied on a portfolio of intervention tools, but the biggest commitments and outlays have been in the form of debt and asset guarantees, while purchases of bad assets have been very limited. Announcements directed at the banking system as a whole (general) and at specific banks (specific) were priced by the markets. General announcements tend to be associated with positive returns and specific announcements with negative ones. Moreover, general announcements exert cross-country spillovers but are perceived by the home-country banks as subsidies boosting the competitive advantage of foreign banks. Specific announcements exert spillovers on other banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | ssrn= 1476786| title=Rescuing Banks from the Effects of Financial Crisis | publisher=SSRN Working Paper | year=2009| first=Michele | last=Fratianni|author2=Francesco Marchionne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Senate's version of the $700 billion bailout plan, [[HR1424]], modified to expand bank deposit guarantees to $250,000 and to include $100 billion in tax breaks for businesses and [[alternative energy]], passed with bi-partisan support 74-25 on October 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/business/02bailout.html | title=Adding Sweeteners, Senate Passes Bailout Plan | publisher=The New York Times | date=2008-10-01 | accessdate=2008-10-01 | first=Carl | last=Hulse |author2=David M.

==Week of October 12==
On Sunday the British government was in negotiations with Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS, Lloyds TSB and Barclays, major British banks, regarding recapitalization which would give the British government a substantial equity interest. An investment of more than 37 billion pounds was contemplated. Some purchases would be common stock with existing shareholders given a right of first refusal (the government would only purchase the shares if existing shareholders did not). Previously announced recapitalization plans contemplated only purchases of preferred equity without government participation in governance of the banks, however, as the financial emergency has rapidly developed, more aggressive measures are being advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/153e175e-9883-11dd-ace3-000077b07658.html | title=UK set to inject over £37bn into banks | publisher=The Financial Times | date=2008-10-12 | accessdate=2008-10-12 | first=Peter Thal | last=Larsen |author2=Jane Croft |author3=Chris Giles}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Sunday, October 12, European leaders, meeting in Paris, led by France and Germany, announced recapitalization plans for Europe's banks.

On Sunday, in Norway, which is not in the euro zone, the [[Second cabinet Stoltenberg|Norwegian cabinet]] in a hastily called press conference announced a US$57.4 billion (350 billion Norwegian [[Norwegian krone|kroner]]) plan of offering Norwegian banks new [[government bond]]s. This came three days ahead of Wednesday's hastened interest rate meeting at [[Norges Bank]] to decide whether or not to announce rate cuts similar to the coordinated cuts of October 8. Central bank Governor [[Svein Gjedrem]] also made critical comments about some of the measures that had been implemented already by other countries, among them the concerted rate cuts which he said "was a strong card, which had a two-hour impact". He further commented that "It's important to be careful with measures – so that one addresses the problems one really faces," and he also emphasized that acting at the right time was important saying "there are unusually many examples that show one can do too much too early." He cited the Icelandic government's takeover of banks as an example of quick action with no guarantee that the problems would be solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSLC4390020081012?sp=true | title=Norway c.bank says rate cuts had shortlived impact | agency=[[Reuters]] | date=2008-10-12 | accessdate=2008-10-12 | first=Terje | last=Solsvik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The G7 nations, at their meeting in Washington over the weekend pledged to "support systemically important financial institutions and prevent their failure". This decision is based on analysis of the consequences of the [[bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]] which resulted in the loss of funds by other financial institutions. It is thought that those losses may have triggered a tightening of the credit crunch as banks ceased to lend to one another. No enforceable mechanism was created to support the pledge, but it is believed to extend to major firms such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5a4ab6f2-988a-11dd-ace3-000077b07658.html | title=G7 pledge ‘no more Lehmans’ | publisher=The Financial Times | date=2008-10-12 | accessdate=2008-10-12 | first=Krishna | last=Guha }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK government would end up owning a majority share in the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and over a 40% share in Lloyds and HBOS.

On Tuesday the United States announced a plan to take an equity interest of $250 billion in US banks with 25 billion going to each of the four largest banks. The 9 largest banks in the US: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street were called into a meeting on Monday morning and pressured to sign; all eventually agreed. The plan will be open to any bank for 30 days. The equity interests purchased by the government are preferred shares that pay 5% but rise to 9% after 5 years; it is expected that the companies will repurchase this interest when they can raise private capital to do so. The plan also includes an option allowing the government to purchase common stock according to a formula which could return substantial profit to the taxpayers should the stock price of the companies substantially appreciate. The total liability assumed is $2.25 trillion including a $1.5 trillion guarantee of new senior debt issued by banks and a $500 billion guarantee of deposits in noninterest-bearing accounts (business accounts used to pay current obligations such as payroll). The theory is that with additional capitalization and the guarantees, banks will be willing to resume a normal lending pattern with each other and borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/14/business/economy/14treasury.html | title=U.S. Investing $250 Billion in Banks  | publisher=The New York Times | date=2008-10-13 | accessdate=2008-10-14 | first=Mark | last=Landler }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/business/economy/15bailout.html | title=Drama Behind a $250 Billion Banking Deal | publisher=The New York Times | date=2008-10-14 | accessdate=2008-10-15 | first=Mark | last=Landler |author2=Eric Dash}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/hp1207.htm Treasury Announces TARP Capital Purchase Program Description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118174508/http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/hp1207.htm |date=2009-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/hp1206.htm Joint Statement by Treasury, Federal Reserve and FDIC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/business/15assess.html | title=A Winner for Treasury?

Despite some improvement in the availability of credit, stock markets and weak currencies such as the British pound and the euro continued to decline worldwide during the week of October 19. Markets across Asia suffered particularly heavy losses while European markets experienced substantial losses too, but to a lesser extent compared to those in Asia. The Dow Industrials Index, on the other hand, experienced a week of extreme volatility with violent swings both upwards and downwards, eventually ending lower. The yen and the dollar showed particular strength with the yen rising with respect to the dollar. This "flight to quality" had baleful effects on the economies of all nations including the United States and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/25/business/25currency.html | title=Dollar and Yen Soar as Other Currencies Fall and Stocks Slip | publisher=The New York Times | date=2008-10-24 | accessdate=2008-10-25 | first=Mark | last=Landler |author2=Vikas Bajaj}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/business/23markets.html | title=Stocks Dive as Crisis Erodes Earnings; Dow Drops 5.7%  | publisher=The New York Times | date=2008-10-21 | accessdate=2008-10-22 | first=Michael M. | last=Grynbaum }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/stocks-drop-sharply-in-europe-and-asia | title=Stocks Drop Sharply in Europe and Asia | publisher=The New York Times | date=2008-10-22 | accessdate=2008-10-22 | first=Andrew Ross | last=Sorkin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/business/24markets.html | title=Asian Market Losses Deepen | publisher=The New York Times | date=2008-10-22 | accessdate=2008-10-22 | first=Bettina | last=Wassener }}&lt;/ref&gt; On Wednesday, Pakistan joined Iceland, Hungary, Serbia and Ukraine and requested aid from the International Monetary Fund in dealing with severe balance of payments difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/world/asia/23pakistan.html | title=Pakistan Asks I.M.F. for Aid to Repay Debt | newspaper=The New York Times | date=2008-10-22 | accessdate=2008-10-22 |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungary, Russia, Ukraine, Pakistan, Turkey, South Africa, Argentina, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Bulgaria were all experiencing financial difficulties with others threatened.

On Friday, October 24, stock markets plummeted worldwide amidst growing fears among investors that a deep global recession is imminent if not already settled in. The panic was partly fueled by remarks made by [[Alan Greenspan]] that the crisis is "a once-in-a-century credit tsunami" and by comments made by [[Gordon Brown]] during a speech, admitting essentially that Great Britain is already in recession mode. Following the trend, the US stock markets also fell sharply on opening and ended with the Dow Industrial Index down 312 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/25/business/25markets.html | title=U.S. Stocks Slide After Rout Overseas | publisher=The New York Times | date=2008-10-24 | accessdate=2008-10-24 | first=Alan | last=Cowell |author2=Julia Werdigier |author3=Michael M.

Two thirds of [[Istanbul]] was destroyed in the '''Great Fire of 1660'''. The chronicler Abdi Paşa estimated that the fire destroyed 280,000 houses and burned for approximately forty-nine hours.

During the reconstruction of the city, the Ottomans enacted unprecedented policies concerning [[Christianity in the Ottoman Empire|Christian]] and [[Jews in the Ottoman Empire|Jewish]] houses of worship. In previous periods, the Ottomans had usually allowed the rebuilding of churches and synagogues. However, in this period they applied Islamic laws prohibiting reconstruction.

==Background==
On July 24, 1660, there was a great fire in Istanbul. It destroyed two thirds of the city. Seven synagugues and at least 25 churches burned to the ground.{{sfn|Parker|2013|p=204}} Contemporary sources have written that thousands of homes were caught in the blaze. The fire began west of Eminönü and destroyed densely populated neighborhoods with old-fashioned wooden homes. Abdi Paşa tells us that the fire "marched across the city like an invading army."{{sfn|Baer|2004|p=159-160}} Contemporary sources estimate that 280,000 homes were destroyed and 40,000 lives were lost in the conflagration.{{sfn|Zdanowski|2014|p=239}}

==Aftermath==
Marc David Baer has written that imperial mosques in the [[Ottoman Empire]] marked the boundaries of Ottoman territory and supported political and hegemonic interests.{{sfn|Baer|2008}}

The Yeni Valide Mosque or [[New Mosque (Istanbul)|New Mosque]] project had started while [[Mehmed III]]{{'}}s mother, [[Safiye Sultan]], was [[Valide Sultan]] of the Ottoman Empire, but the project was abandoned for several decades after her death. Construction of the site's foundation had initially started on land that had been taken from the non-Muslims in the area of [[Eminönü]] in Istanbul, but they had started to return to nearby areas.{{sfn|Thys-Senocak|1998|p=58}} The imperial family remained uninterested in completing the New Mosque project until the fire destroyed the entire area between [[Unkapanı]] and Eminönü in 1660, after which the non-Muslim population was once again deprived of their properties.{{sfn|Thys-Senocak|1998|p=59}} When the government began to rebuild the city a ban was issued forbidding the reconstruction of churches and synagogues.{{sfn|Zdanowski|2014|p=239}}

The young Grand Vizier [[Köprülüzade Fazıl Ahmed Pasha|Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed]] invited the [[Kadizadeli]] preacher Vani Mehmet Efendi to Istanbul. Upon Vani's advice, the sultan forbade consumption of tobacco, coffee and alcohol and insisted on strict enforcement of Islamic law. He destroyed [[Sufi]] tombs and either exiled or executed Sufi leaders.{{sfn|Parker|2013|pp=204-205}}

Vani claimed that the disproportionate destruction of Jewish property in the Great Fire was a sign of divine displeasure. He supported legislation barring them from returning to the area. Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed confiscated all the lands where synagogues had stood and auctioned them. Non-Muslims were forbidden from bidding on the properties.{{sfn|Parker|2013|p=205}} [[Turhan Hatice Sultan|Turhan Sultan]] sponsored the construction of the New Mosque. It opened in 1665 and Vani Mehmet Efendi became its first preacher.{{sfn|Parker|2013|p=205}}

After a time, Christians were allowed to buy back the land where churches had stood and rebuild them. The rebuilt churches were officially listed as residential buildings.{{sfn|Zdanowski|2014|p=239}}

[[File:Arctic Sunrise in Libya 1.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The ''[[Arctic Sunrise]]'' in 2007.]]

After Greenpeace activists attempted to scale the [[Prirazlomnoye field|Prirazlomnaya]] [[drilling platform]] on 18 September 2013, as part of a protest against Arctic oil production, Russian authorities seized the Greenpeace ship the ''[[Arctic Sunrise]]'' in international waters in the Russian [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] on 19 September 2013, arrested the crew at gunpoint, towed the ship to Murmansk, and detained the crew of 28 activists and two freelance journalists.
The [[ Investigative Committee of Russia ]] opened a criminal investigation, charging the activists initially with [[piracy]] and later with [[hooliganism]].
Since the ''Arctic Sunrise'' was flying the Dutch flag, the Netherlands filed a case at the [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]] (ITLOS case 22) which argued (and obtained ruling) the release of the crew and ship until both parties can resolve the conflict. Russia ignored the ITLOS ruling, but eventually released the crew as part of a general amnesty adopted by the [[State Duma]] after two months of detention.
The ''Arctic Sunrise'' itself was released from Russian detainment in June 2014.

==Background==

On 11 August 2013, the [[Greenpeace]] ship ''[[Arctic Sunrise]]'' left the Norwegian port of [[Kirkenes]] to begin a month-long expedition in the Arctic to protest against oil exploration in Arctic waters.&lt;ref name="Into the Arctic"&gt;Rawer, Daniel. [http://intothearctic.gp/en/#/map/stories/confronting_arctic_oil/day-13/06-02pm "http://intothearctic.gp/en/#/map/stories/confronting_arctic_oil/day-13/06-02pm"], [[Greenpeace]], 12 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Arctic Sunrise'' sailed into the [[Barents Sea]] and was then refused permission three times by the Russian authorities to enter the [[Northern Sea Route]] although the refusal is in violation of international law including the right to freedom of navigation.&lt;ref name="Greenpeace Press Release"&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/press-releases/russia-shuts-greenpeace-out-arctic-sea-route-stifles-criticism-oil-industry-20130821 "Russia shuts Greenpeace out of Arctic Sea route, stifles criticism of oil industry"], [[Greenpeace]], 21 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenpeace Australia"&gt;Rashini Suriyaarachchi [http://www.greenpeace.org.au/blog/defending-the-arctic-even-as-russia-threatens-to-use-force/ "Defending the Arctic even as Russia threatens to use force"], [[Greenpeace]], 26 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 August, Greenpeace ignored Russia's ban to protest state oil company Rosneft’s operations in the Arctic and entered the international waters of the [[Kara Sea]].&lt;ref name="Rianovosti"&gt;[http://en.ria.ru/russia/20130824/182942111.html "Greenpeace Ship Sails to Arctic Kara Sea Despite Ban"], [[RIA Novosti]], 24 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August, the ''Arctic Sunrise'' left the Northern Sea Route, after the Russian coastguard boarded the boat and threatened to use force if they would not leave the international waters of the Kara sea.&lt;ref name="Newswire"&gt;[http://ens-newswire.com/2013/08/26/russians-force-greenpeace-ship-to-leave-kara-sea/ "Russians Force Greenpeace Ship to Leave Kara Sea"], ''[[Environment News Service]]'', 26 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prirazlomnaya protest, and seizure of the ''Arctic Sunrise'' and crew==
On 18 September 2013, four [[RHIB]] inflatables were launched from the ''Arctic Sunrise'' from its position in the [[Pechora Sea]].&lt;ref name="Moscow Times"&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/special/environment/eng/greenpeace-storms-prirazlomnaya-platform-in-arctic.html "Greenpeace Storms Prirazlomnaya Platform in Arctic"], ''[[The Moscow Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The RHIBs carried [[Greenpeace]] activists and crew members towards [[Gazprom]]'s [[Prirazlomnaya]] [[drilling platform]].  At the time of the action, the ''Arctic Sunrise'' tweeted "We're going to try and stop the drilling.",&lt;ref name="Twitter"&gt;[https://twitter.com/gp_sunrise/status/380127561423925248 ''Arctic Sunrise'' Twitter feed], 18 September 2013 ''Twitter''.&lt;/ref&gt; although subsequently Greenpeace have stated that their aim was to hang banners on the oil rig to call for an end to Arctic drilling.&lt;ref name="Ruptly"&gt;[http://rt.com/news/greenpeace-arctic-platform-shots-034/ "Warning shots fired as Russia detains Greenpeace activists at Arctic oil rig"], Warning shots fired as Russia detains Greenpeace activists at Arctic oil rig, 18 September 2013 ''[[Ruptly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Two activists managed to attach themselves to the platform and attempted to climb, despite being blasted with water, while another activist tried unsuccessfully to become attached to the platform. The Russian coastguard fired warning shots from [[AK-74]] rifles and four warning shots from a cannon on board the ''Ladoga'' coastal patrol vessel.&lt;ref name="Ruptly" /&gt; The two activists were removed from the platform and held on board the coastguard vessel, although it was unclear whether or not they had been placed under arrest.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24141667 "Greenpeace Activists Being Held Without Charge By Russia" Greenpeace assails oil rig in Russian Arctic], BBC News, 18 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scoop"&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1309/S00319/greenpeace-activists-being-held-without-charge-by-russia.htm "Greenpeace Activists Being Held Without Charge By Russia"], ''[[Scoop Independent News]]'', 20 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITLOS"&gt;[http://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no.22/Response_questions_en.pdf "Answers to questions posed by the Tribunal"], 7 November 2013'' [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September, the day after the Prirazlomnaya protest, the Russian authorities forcibly took control of the ''Arctic Sunrise'', which was boarded from a helicopter by fifteen [[Federal Security Service]] officers in balaclavas, armed with guns and knives.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;Brown, Jonathan [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/russia-arrests-30-environmental-activists-during-arctic-protest-8830165.html "Russia arrests 30 environmental activists during Arctic protest"], 20 September 2013'' [[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the boarding, the ''Arctic Sunrise'' was in Russia's [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] but not within the safety zone around the oil rig, and permission was not sought to board it from the ''Arctic Sunrise'''s [[flag state]], the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="ITLOS" /&gt; The captain was separated from the crew and brutally beaten, while other crew members and activists were held in the mess room.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;Wilson, Steve [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/10322223/Russia-seizes-Greenpeace-ship-after-Arctic-rig-protest.html "Russia ''seizes'' Greenpeace ship after Arctic rig protest"], 20 September 2013'' [[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is alleged that crew members and activists were brutally beaten, punched and kicked during the forced boarding.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;

The ''Arctic Sunrise'' was towed to the port of [[Murmansk]]. All of the 30 people on board were taken to a detention facility where they were brutally beaten and interrogated. In early October, the [[Leninsky Administrative Okrug, Murmansk|Leninsky]] [[Judiciary of Russia#District courts|District Court]] in Murmansk issued a warrant to arrest all 30 people.&lt;ref name="en.itar-tass.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arrested Greenpeace activists to be transferred to St. Petersburg by November 12|agency=[[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia|ITAR-TASS]]|date=11 November 2013|url=http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/705589}}&lt;/ref&gt; 22 were put in custody for two months pending an investigation and the other eight were detained for three days pending a new hearing.

According to [[Phil Radford]], Executive Director of Greenpeace in the U.S. at the time, the reaction of the [[Coast Guard (Russia)|Russian coast guard]] and courts were the "stiffest response that Greenpeace has encountered from a government since the [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|bombing]] of the ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|Rainbow Warrior]]'' in 1985."&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news |first = Kathy |last=Lally |first2=Will |last2=Englund|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/us-greenpeace-captain-jailed-in-russia/2013/09/27/5e4f6968-2788-11e3-9372-92606241ae9c_story.html |title= U.S. Greenpeace captain jailed in Russia |work = The Washington Post| date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the jailed people is the award-winning Russian photographer Denis Sinyakov, whose jailing led to protests by the Russian Union of Journalists and the international group [[Reporters Without Borders]].&lt;ref name="Rianovosti"/&gt; According to Alexei Simonov, head of [[Glasnost Defense Foundation]], a Moscow-based rights group, Sinyakov was only covering the actions of Greenpeace activists in the Barents Sea and has nothing to do with the group's agenda, saying: "The authorities violated all norms and laws by keeping Sinyakov in prison&amp;nbsp;... I must say it again and again that Russian justice system is designed by the Kremlin not to look for real culprits to be punished but to punish and scare those who don't suit the authorities."&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;Loiko, Sergei L. [http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-greenpeace-activists-under-arrest-20130926,0,4020565.story "Greenpeace activists, Moscow photographer placed under arrest"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 26 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Sinyakov posted on his Facebook account an image of a hooded Russian coast guardsman pointing a handgun at the boat. When the first two activists were detained, Sinyakov wrote: "I call upon you to join the struggle for freeing these activists, who sincerely see Arctic exploration as malignant." He was subsequently detained.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The top trans-Atlantic security and rights group, the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]], also demanded Sinyakov's immediate release. Several Russian media outlets, including the lenta.ru site and a private but Kremlin-friendly{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} national TV station, [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]], took all pictures off their websites in a show of solidarity with the jailed photographer.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt; In Paris, a few dozen Greenpeace activists protested in front of the Russian Embassy on 27 September, waving banners with images of the incarcerated activists and the word "FREE" written over them. Up to 22 November, Russian court released all but one of the Greenpeace campaigners against bail (paid by Greenpeace) with the condition the campaigners could not leave Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/11/russia-frees-greenpeace-activists-bail-201311229514726461.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[flag state]] for the ''Arctic Sunrise'', the Netherlands asked for immediate release of the ship and shipmates to Dutch authorities. The Dutch government argues that since the ship was outside Russian [[territorial waters]] and outside the (500 meter) safety zone around the oil rig, it was in open sea, and hence outside Russian sovereign rights and jurisdiction. According to nautical law any actions against a ship in open sea can only be conducted after agreement with the flag state. Hence the Dutch take the position the capture of the ''Arctic Sunrise'' by Russia was not legal. After Russia did not release the ship the Netherlands filed a formal case to the [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]] 21. October to order Russia to release a Greenpeace ship and the activists who were on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/netherlands-asks-sea-law-tribunal-to-order-russia-to-release-greenpeace-ship-and-activists/2013/10/21/e68980dc-3ab3-11e3-b0e7-716179a2c2c7_story.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131022090132/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/netherlands-asks-sea-law-tribunal-to-order-russia-to-release-greenpeace-ship-and-activists/2013/10/21/e68980dc-3ab3-11e3-b0e7-716179a2c2c7_story.html |archive-date=22 October 2013 |title=Netherlands asks sea law tribunal to order Russia to release Greenpeace ship and activists |work=The Washington Post |date=21 October 2013 |accessdate=26 October 2013 |deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt; However, Russian government announced that it will not participate in the hearings, pointing out that back in 1997, when it ratified the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], it refused to acknowledge the settlement procedures, which result in mandatory decisions in disputes over sovereign rights and jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/news/greenpeace-arctic-sunrise-court-617/ Arctic Sunrise case: Russia to boycott intl maritime tribunal over Greenpeace arrests] 23 October 2013 [[RT (TV network)|RT]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal cases against Russia===

On 22 November 2013 the [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]] ruled that the campaigners and the ship should be immediately released, and should be allowed to leave the country, against a bail of 3.5 Million Euro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5c7cea3c-5386-11e3-9250-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2lgOoEQFY]&lt;/ref&gt;
On 14 August 2015 the international [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] unanimously ruled that Russia had acted in breach of the [[UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]] and has to compensate the Dutch government (flag state of the ship) for damages to the ship. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34045493]&lt;/ref&gt; The tribunal ruled that actions of Greenpeace could not be labelled as piracy or hooliganism; reasons Russia had given for capturing the ship. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/russian-arrest-of-greenpeace-arctic-30-activists-illegal-tribunal-says-20150825-gj79xr.html|title=Court orders Russia to pay compensation for Greenpeace ship seizure|date=2015-08-25|access-date=2017-11-05|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, a partner of the permanent court of arbitration, responded by stating it does not recognize the authority of the court in this case.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/08/25/uk-netherlands-russia-greenpeace-idUKKCN0QU0MA20150825&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenpeace announcements ===
[[File:Arctic 30 Berlin 041113 03.jpg|thumb|Vigil for the release of the Arctic 30 in front of the Russian embassy in Berlin]]

According to Greenpeace, charges of [[piracy]] against peaceful activists have no merit in international law. Greenpeace rejected the suggestion of [[Prohibition of drugs|illegal drugs]] on the ''Arctic Sunrise''. Certain [[pharmaceutical drug]]s are kept in a safe. The Russian authorities broke the safe after they took the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/Greenpeace-responds-to-allegations-by-Russian-authorities/ |title=Greenpeace International responds to allegations from Russian authorities |publisher=Greenpeace |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phil Radford]], executive director of Greenpeace USA, argues that the arrest of the Arctic 30 is the stiffest response that [[Greenpeace]] has encountered from a government since the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior by the French secret service in 1985.&lt;ref name="Washington Post"/&gt;

[[Greenpeace]] activists continue to call for governments to save the arctic, the original motivation for the protest.

According to Dutch Greenpeace members, the condition of the Greenpeace ship worsened during its stay in Murmansk, as the Russian officials are not taking proper care of the vessel.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/17/greenpeace-activists-warn-arctic-sunrise-risk Greenpeace activist arrested in Russia raises alarm over Arctic Sunrise ship] 17 October 2013 [[The Guardian]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde''''' is a 1997 [[Play (theatre)|play]] written by [[Moisés Kaufman]]. It deals with [[Oscar Wilde]]'s three trials on the matter of his relationship with [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] and others, which led to charges of "committing acts of [[Sodomy law|gross indecency]] with other male persons". The play uses real quotes and transcripts of the three trials.

The first trial was a private prosecution for criminal libel brought against Douglas's father the [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]] by Wilde himself (which he lost); the second and third were on the resulting criminal charges against Wilde, with the second reaching no verdict and the third resulting in a conviction and sentence to hard labour. 

==Performances==
''Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde'' was staged [[Off-Broadway]] at the Greenwich House,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curtainup.com/grossind.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9A06EFDB1038F93AA25750C0A961958260&lt;/ref&gt; and received two critically acclaimed stagings in [[Los Angeles]]: one at the [[Mark Taper Forum]] in 1998&lt;ref&gt;http://www.robkendt.com/Reviews/Gross+Indecency.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the other by director Susan Lee at the Eclectic Theatre in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/philip_brandes/page/2/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.backstage.com/bso/reviews-la-theatre/gross-indecency-the-three-trials-of-oscar-1004020272.story&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11608">The '''Honda Battle of the Bands''' (sometimes abbreviated '''The Honda''' or '''HBOB''') is an annual [[marching band]] exhibition in the [[United States]] which features performances by bands from [[historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCUs). Sponsored by the [[Honda|American Honda Motor Company]], the '''Invitational Showcase''' takes place in the [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] in late January.

The '''Honda Battle of the Bands Celebration Tour''' takes place between the months of September and November at regular season [[college football|football]] games, although Honda Battle of the Bands (and its abbreviations) is often intended to refer only to the invitational showcase, which first took place in 2003. Seemingly contradictory to the name, Honda's "battle" is not a competition in the traditional sense; that is, no winner is crowned during the event. Rather, the bands compete for the favor of the audience, each other, and the greater community.  The 2016 event had a nearly sold out crowd with 63,000+ fans and spectators in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbs8.com/story/31099788/63000-celebrate-hbcu-marching-band-excellence-at-honda-battle-of-the-bands-for-the-ages&lt;/ref&gt;

The Honda Battle of the Bands program includes two components — the Voting Process, which runs September through October, and the "Honda Battle of the Bands Invitational Showcase".

Voting:
The first band will be selected by popular vote (i.e. the top overall vote-getter will be selected regardless of category).
The next three bands will be selected, one from each category by a weighted vote of 1/3 from institution president, band director and online opinion poll from category I, II and III. The categories being 128 instruments or less, 129 instruments up to 160 and 161 or more. This count is total instrument count, no auxiliaries, drum majors, etc. but will include percussion.
[[File:Mercedes Benz Stadium time lapse capture 2017-08-13.jpg|thumb|240px|Mercedez-Benz Stadium]]
:a. Online Opinion Poll at hondabattleofthebands.com -- 1/3 weight
:b. Band Directors’ Votes -- 1/3 weight
:c. Presidents’ Votes -- 1/3 weight

Note: Presidents and Band Directors are not permitted to vote for their own institutions.
[[American Honda Motor Company|American Honda]] and Urban Sports &amp; Entertainment Group will select the final four bands based on, but not limited to:
:a. Showmanship
:b. Social Media Buzz
:c. Years of previous participation in the Celebration Tour

Once all the votes are tallied, a total of '''8 bands''' are invited to perform their carefully choreographed, halftime time routines in front of 50,000+ fans.

== History ==
Started in 2003, the Honda Battle of the Bands was created to celebrate, support and recognize the excellence of Black college marching bands and the unique academic experience offered by Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Honda annually awards more than $205,000 in grants to participating marching bands during the program period and facilitates a HBCU recruitment fair preceding the band showcase.

The following HBCUs have participated in the Honda Invitational Showcase, with [[Bethune-Cookman University]] leading with thirteen appearances:

==Trivia==
* The fictitious [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] Big Southern Classic from the 2002 film ''[[Drumline (film)|Drumline]]'' was similar to the HBOB, with the main difference that the Big Southern Classic was a competition with a declared winner. The HBOB is an invitational showcase and there are no official winners.

'''Hwang Woo-suk''' ({{lang-ko|황우석}}, born January 29, 1953)&lt;ref name="birthdate"&gt;Sources disagree on the birthdate due to confusion between different calendar systems. Hwang was born on January 29, 1953 in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. However, older Koreans often list their birthdate in the [[Lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] [[Korean calendar]], which in this case is December 15, 1952. This date is sometimes repeated in English-language media without specifying that it is in the Korean calendar, causing further confusion when the Gregorian year and Korean calendar  month and day are used together to produce an incorrect birthdate of December 15, 1953. Sources specifying a December 15, 1952 birthdate include the [http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/17/world/fg-clone17 Los Angeles Times] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20071001001716/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/184100/1/.html Channel News Asia].

He was a professor of [[theriogenology]] and [[biotechnology]] at [[Seoul National University]] (dismissed on March 20, 2006) who became infamous for fabricating a series of experiments, which appeared in high-profile journals, in the field of [[stem cell]] research. Until November 2005, he was considered one of the pioneering experts in the field, best known for two articles published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 2004 and 2005 where he reported he had succeeded in creating [[human embryonic stem cells]] by [[cloning]].

Soon after the first paper was released, however, an article in the journal ''Nature'' charged Hwang with having committed ethical violations by using eggs from his graduate students and from the black market.&lt;ref name="Cyranoski, David"&gt;{{cite web |title=Korea's stem-cell stars dogged by suspicions of ethical breach|author=Cyranoski, David |date=6 May 2004 |publisher=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v429/n6987/full/429003a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he denied the charges at first, Hwang admitted the allegations were true in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Clone star admits lies over eggs|author=Cyranoski, David and Erika Check |date=1 December 2005 |publisher=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7068/full/438536a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after that his human cloning experiments were revealed to be fraudulent.

On May 12, 2006, Hwang was charged with [[embezzlement]] and bioethics law violations after it emerged much of his stem cell research had been faked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/12/world/asia/12korea.html | work = [[New York Times]] | title = Disgraced Korean Cloning Scientist Indicted | date = May 12, 2006 |agency=Associated Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629072144/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/12/world/asia/12korea.html |archivedate=2013-06-29 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Korea Times]]'' reported on June 10, 2007, that Seoul National University fired him, and the South Korean government canceled his financial support and barred him from engaging in stem cell research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Cho Jin-seo |date=June 10, 2007 |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2007/06/129_4446.html |work=Korea Times |title=Hwang Woo-suk to Resume Cell Cloning Abroad |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210065845/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2007/06/129_4446.html |archivedate=2009-02-10 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While being charged with fraud and embezzlement, he has kept a relatively low profile at the Sooam Bioengineering Research Institute in [[Yongin]], [[Gyeonggi Province]], where he currently leads research efforts on creating cloned pig embryos and using them to make embryonic stem-cell lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2009/05/129_44979.html |title=Hwang Claims to Have Cloned Pig Stem Cells |author=Kim Tong-hyung |date=May 15, 2009 |work=The Korea Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425015910/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2009/05/129_44979.html |archivedate=2011-04-25 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the controversy subsided, despite the history and his lost credibility as a scientist, Hwang's lab has been actively publishing manuscripts, many of which have appeared on PubMed, the online database for biomedical research.  In February 2011, Hwang visited [[Libya]] as part of a $133 million project in the North African country to build a stem cell research center and transfer relevant technology. However, the project was canceled due to [[2011 Libyan civil war|civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/02/28/2011022801431.html |title=Disgraced Cloning Scientist Had High Hopes for Libya Contract |date=February 28, 2011&lt;!-- see bottom of page--&gt; |work=The Chosun Ilbo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303050057/http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/02/28/2011022801431.html |archivedate=2011-03-03 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2015, a Chinese biotech company Boyalife Group announced that it will partner with Hwang’s laboratory, [[snuppy#subsequent developments|Sooam Biotech]], to open the world's largest animal cloning factory in [[Tianjin]] as early as 2016.  The factory will aim to produce up to one million cattle [[embryos]] per year to meet the increasing demand for quality beef in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/disgraced-clone-expert-set-for-big-comeback |title=Disgraced clone expert set for big comeback|author=Chang May Choon|publisher=The Straits Times|date=30 November 2015|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
Hwang first caught media attention in South Korea when he announced he successfully created a cloned dairy cow, ''Yeongrong-i'' in February 1999. His alleged success was touted as the fifth instance in the world in cow cloning, with a notable caveat: Hwang failed to provide scientifically verifiable data for the research, giving only media sessions and [[photo-op]]s. Hwang's next claim came only two months later in April 1999, when he announced the cloning of a Korean cow, ''Jin-i'', also without providing any scientifically verifiable data. Despite the notable absence of any of the scientific data needed to probe the validity of the research, Hwang's several claims were well received by the South Korean media and public, who were attracted by Hwang's claim of immeasurable economic prospect that his research was said to be promising. Until 2004, Hwang's main area of research remained in creating genetically modified livestock that included cows and pigs. During that period, Hwang claimed to have created a [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]]-resistant cow (which has not been verified) and also stated his intention to clone a [[Siberian tiger]].

In February 2004, Hwang and his team announced that they had successfully created an embryonic stem cell with the [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] method, and published their paper in the March 12 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hwang WS | title=Evidence of a pluripotent human embryonic stem cell line derived from a cloned blastocyst | journal=Science | year=2004 | pages=1669–74 | volume=303 | issue=5664 | pmid=14963337 | doi=10.1126/science.1094515 |name-list-format=vanc | display-authors=1 | last2=Ryu | first2=YJ | last3=Park | first3=JH | last4=Park | first4=ES | last5=Lee | first5=EG | last6=Koo | first6=JM | last7=Jeon | first7=HY | last8=Lee | first8=BC | last9=Kang | first9=SK}}{{Retracted paper|{{PMID|16410485}}|intentional=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hwang had already established himself as an expert in animal cloning and secured celebrity status in South Korea in the late 90s, his alleged sudden success came as a surprise because this was the first reported success in human somatic cell cloning. Until Hwang's claim, it was generally agreed that creating a human stem cell by cloning was next to impossible due to the complexity of primates. Hwang explained that his team used 242 eggs to create a single cell line.

In May, ''Nature'' magazine published an article stating that Hwang had used eggs taken from two of his graduate students, based on an interview with one of the students. The article raised the question of whether the students might have been pressured to give eggs and thus whether such a donation would have been "voluntary" as Hwang claimed in his scientific paper. At that time, Hwang denied that he had used his students' eggs.&lt;ref name="Cyranoski, David"/&gt;

Hwang's team announced an even greater achievement a year later in May 2005, and claimed they had created 11 human embryonic stem cells using 185 eggs. His work, published in the June 17 issue of ''Science'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hwang WS | title=Patient-specific embryonic stem cells derived from human SCNT blastocysts | journal=Science | year=2005 | pages=1777–83 | volume=308 | issue=5729 | pmid=15905366 | doi=10.1126/science.1112286 |name-list-format=vanc | display-authors=1 | last2=Roh | first2=SI | last3=Lee | first3=BC | last4=Kang | first4=SK | last5=Kwon | first5=DK | last6=Kim | first6=S | last7=Kim | first7=SJ | last8=Park | first8=SW | last9=Kwon | first9=HS}}{{Retracted paper|{{PMID|16410485}}|intentional=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; was instantly hailed as a breakthrough in biotechnology because the cells were allegedly created with somatic cells from patients of different age and gender, while the stem cell of 2004 was created with eggs and somatic cells from a single female donor. This meant every patient could receive custom-made treatment with no immune reactions. In addition, Hwang's claim meant that his team had boosted their success rate by 14 times and that this technology could be medically viable.

Hwang made further headlines in May 2005 when he criticized [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s policy on embryonic stem cell research. Also, [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine named Hwang one of its "People Who Mattered 2004", stating that Hwang "has already proved that human cloning is no longer science fiction, but a fact of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/2004/personoftheyear/people/hwang_woo_suk.html | work=Time | title=People Who Mattered 2004 | date=December 27, 2004 | accessdate=March 16, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041230004800/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2004/personoftheyear/people/hwang_woo_suk.html |archivedate=2004-12-30 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following on the earlier success, on August 3, 2005, Hwang announced that his team of researchers had become the first team to successfully clone a dog, which has been independently verified through genetic testing. The dog, an [[Afghan Hound]], was named ''[[Snuppy]]''.

Shortly after his groundbreaking 2005 work, Hwang was appointed to head the new [[World Stem Cell Hub]], a facility that was to be the world's leading stem cell research centre. However, in November 2005, [[Gerald Schatten]], a [[University of Pittsburgh]] researcher who had worked with Hwang for two years, made the surprise announcement that he had ceased his collaboration with Hwang. In an interview, Schatten commented that "my decision is grounded solely on concerns regarding [[oocyte]] (egg) donations in Hwang's research reported in 2004." Following an intense media probe, [[Roh Sung-il]], one of Hwang's close collaborators and head of ''MizMedi Women's Hospital'', held a news conference on November 21.

During the conference Roh admitted that he had paid women US$1,400 each for donating their eggs, eggs that were later used in Hwang's research. However, Roh claimed Hwang was unaware of this, while the South Korean [[Ministry of Health (South Korea)|Ministry of Health]] assured that no laws or ethical guidelines had been breached as there were no commercial interests involved in this payout. Hwang maintained that he was unaware that these actions were happening during the research and he resigned from his post.

On November 22, ''[[PD Notebook|PD Su-cheop]]'' (''PD Notebook''), a popular [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] investigative reporting show, raised the possibility of unethical conduct  in the egg cell acquiring process. Despite the factual accuracy of the report, news media as well as people caught up in nationalistic fervor in their unwavering support for Hwang asserted that criticism of Hwang's work was "unpatriotic", so much so that the major companies who were sponsoring the show immediately withdrew their support.

On November 24, Hwang held a press conference in Seoul, in which he declared his intention of resigning from most of his official posts.

He also apologized for his actions. In the interview he said, "I was blinded by work and my drive for achievement."  He denied coercing his researchers into donating eggs and claimed that he found out about the situation only after it had occurred.

He added that he had lied about the source of the eggs donated to protect the privacy of his female researchers, and that he was not aware of the [[Declaration of Helsinki]], which clearly enumerates his actions as a breach of ethical conduct.

After the press conference, which was aired on all major South Korean television networks, most of the nation's media outlets, government ministries, and the public gave support to Hwang. Sympathy for Hwang poured out, resulting in an increase in the number of women who wanted to donate their eggs for Hwang's research.

On December 29, 2005, the university determined that all 11 of Hwang's stem cell lines were fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2005/University-Hwang-Lied-About-Stem-Cells/id-e5ac54c987467e08c7f45528827d9b1a |title=University: Hwang Lied About Stem Cells |author=Lim, Bo-Mi |agency=Associated Press |date=December 29, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503133628/http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2005/University-Hwang-Lied-About-Stem-Cells/id-e5ac54c987467e08c7f45528827d9b1a |archivedate=2014-05-03 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university announced on January 10, 2006, that Hwang's 2004 and 2005 papers on ''Science'' were both fabricated. Following on the confirmation of scientific misconduct, on January 11, ''Science'' retracted both of Hwang's papers on unconditional terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1124926 | pmid=16410485|title=Editorial Retraction|year=2006|last1=Kennedy|first1=D.|journal=Science|volume=311|issue=5759|pages=335b–335b|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 12, 2006, Hwang held a [[press conference]] to apologize for the entire fiasco, but still did not admit to cheating. Instead, he explicitly put the blame on other members of his research project for having deceived him with false data and alleged a [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]], saying that his projects had been sabotaged and that there was theft of materials involved. He said that cloning human [[stem cells]] was possible and that he had the technology to do it, and if he were given six more months he could prove it. This is an extension of the ten days he said he needed to re-create the stem cells that he asked for back on December 16, 2005. Seoul prosecutors [[Police raid|raided]] his home that day for files and evidence, to start a criminal investigation of Hwang.

On January 20, 2006, Hwang maintained that two of his 11 forged stem cell lines had been maliciously switched for cells from regular, not cloned, embryos. The allegation involves the lines Hwang claims to have created at Seoul-based MizMedi Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10940784/from/RSS/ |title=S. Korea widens stem cell probe |author=Bo-Mi Lim |date=January 20, 2006 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 22, 2016 Hwang received a certificate of patent on NT-1 technology by the Korean Intellectual Property Office.

[[Image:Cloning diagram english.png|thumb|300px|right|Somatic cell nuclear transfer can create clones for both reproductive and therapeutic purposes. The diagram depicts the removal of the donor nucleus for schematic purposes; in practice the whole donor cell is transferred.]]
In the late 1990s, the method that scientists used in cloning was [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]], which is the same procedure that was used to create [[Dolly the sheep]]. This [[laboratory technique]] begins when an egg is taken from a donor and the nucleus is removed from the egg, creating an enucleated egg. A cell, which contains [[DNA]], is then taken from the animal being cloned. The enucleated egg is then fused together with the nucleus of the cloning subject's cell using electricity. This creates an [[embryo]], which is implanted into a [[surrogate pregnancy|surrogate]] mother through [[in vitro fertilization]]. If the procedure is successful, then the surrogate mother will give birth to a baby that is a clone of the cloning subject at the end of a normal gestation period. In 2014 researchers were reporting cloning success rates of seven to eight out of ten&lt;ref&gt;Shukman, David (14 January 2014) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25576718 China cloning on an 'industrial scale'] BBC News Science and Environment, Retrieved 10 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1996 it took 277 attempts to create Dolly.

Hwang allegedly used this technique at his laboratory in [[Seoul National University|SNU]] to clone [[dog]]s during his experiments throughout the early 2000s. He claimed that it was possible to clone [[mammals]] and that probability for success can be better than 1 in 277 attempts (as in similar cases such as Dolly). Hwang was the first in the world to clone a dog, an Afghan hound called [[Snuppy]] in 2005.  He described his procedure for cloning in the journal  ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hwang WS | title=Dogs cloned from adult somatic cells | journal=Nature | year=2005 | pages=641 | volume=436 | issue=7051 | pmid=16079832 | doi=10.1038/436641a |name-list-format=vanc | display-authors=1 | last2=Kim | first2=Min Kyu | last3=Jang | first3=Goo | last4=Oh | first4=Hyun Ju | last5=Yuda | first5=Fibrianto | last6=Kim | first6=Hye Jin | last7=Shamim | first7=M.

Hwang's intention to develop better technique for cloning was focused on [[stem cells]]
because they are still at an early stage of development and retain the potential to turn into many different types of cell and when they divide, each new cell has the potential to either remain a [[stem cell]] or become another type of cell with a more specialized function.

According to stem cell biologists, it might be possible to harness this ability to turn stem cells into a super "repair kit" for the body, theoretically to use stem cells to generate healthy tissue to replace that either damaged by trauma or compromised by disease.
The many conditions and illnesses that may eventually be treated by stem cell therapy include [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[heart disease]], [[stroke]], [[arthritis]], [[diabetes]], [[Burn (injury)|burns]], and [[spinal cord]] damage.

In March 2012, it was announced that Hwang would collaborate with Russian scientists in an attempt to clone a [[woolly mammoth]] from remains found in [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mammoth Task: Plan To Clone Ice Age Beast|url=http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/16188009 |publisher=Sky News|date=March 13, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401163849/http://news.sky.com/story/2931/mammoth-task-plan-to-clone-ice-age-beast |archivedate=2013-04-01 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ2012&gt;{{Cite news|title=Will Resurrecting a Mammoth Be Possible?|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2012/03/13/will-be-resurrecting-a-mammoth-possible/|work=Wall Street Journal|date=March 13, 2012 |author=Woo, Jaeyeon |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423094152/https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2012/03/13/will-be-resurrecting-a-mammoth-possible/ |archivedate=2013-04-23 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously successful cloned eight [[coyote]]s in March 2011 using domestic dogs as surrogate mothers&lt;ref name=Insider&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baer|first1=Drake|title=This Korean lab has nearly perfected dog cloning, and that’s just the start|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/how-woosuk-hwangs-sooam-biotech-mastered-cloning-2015-8|accessdate=26 November 2015|publisher=Business Insider UK|date=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ2012/&gt; and grey wolves.&lt;ref name="NewScientist500"/&gt; However finding a mammoth sample fit for cloning has been unsuccessful as of 2015.&lt;ref name = Insider/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://expert.ru/russian_reporter/2015/05/kogda-oni-vernutsya/ "Когда вернутся мамонты"] February 5, 2015 (retrieved September 6, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Chinese company BoyaLife&lt;ref&gt;http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2015/11/25/2015112501803.html&lt;/ref&gt; announced that in partnership with the Hwang Woo-suk's company Sooam Biotech, they were planning to build a 200 million RMB (about 32 million USD) [[Tianjin animal cloning center|factory in Tianjin, China]] to produce 100,000 cloned cattle per year, starting in 2016 to supply China's growing market for quality beef.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clover|first1=Charles|last2=Cookson|first2=Clive|title=China raises steaks in cloning research|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9f7f8090-91d4-11e5-bd82-c1fb87bef7af.html|publisher=FinancialTimes|date=24 November 2015|page=10|subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Sooam Biotech cloned a male [[Boxer (dog)|boxer]] puppy from a pet dog that had been dead for 12 days. This was the first time they had cloned a dog that had been dead for such a long time.&lt;ref name=Boxer2015&gt;{{cite news|title=British couple celebrate after birth of first cloned puppy of its kind|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/26/british-couple-celebrate-after-birth-of-first-cloned-puppy-of-its-kind|accessdate=27 December 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Hwang's company was regularly cloning pigs which were genetically predisposed to certain diseases so that they could be used for testing pharmaceuticals and cloning cattle which were highly valued for their meat. In total Sooam Biotech was reported to be producing roughly 500 cloned embryos a day from various species.&lt;ref name="NewScientist500"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zastrow|first1=Mark|title=Inside the cloning factory that creates 500 new animals a day|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076681-inside-the-cloning-factory-that-creates-500-new-animals-a-day/|accessdate=23 February 2016|publisher=New Scientist|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also reported to be attempting to clone the [[Ethiopian wolf]], one of the world's rarest canids, of which there are only 500 in the wild, another endangered canid, the [[Dhole]], of which there only about 2,500 adults and the [[Siberian musk deer]] which is classified as vulnerable by the [[IUCN]].&lt;ref name="NewScientist500"/&gt;

==Controversies==

Until late November 2005, Hwang was criticized only for unpublicized [[ethics|ethical]] violations. Colleagues and media outlets asserted that he had paid female donors for egg donations and that he had received donations from two junior researchers, both of which were violations. Later controversies would center around [[scientific misconduct]].

His team, which cloned the first [[embryo|human embryo]] to use for research, said they had used the same technology to create batches of [[embryo]]nic [[stem cell]]s from nine patients. According to Hwang, the result was much more efficient than they had hoped.
Hwang's integrity as a researcher was again put in doubt when it was revealed that ''PD Su-cheop'' scheduled a follow-up report questioning his achievement published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in June 2005, which stated he had cloned 11 lines of embryonic stem cells. This caused furious backlash among many South Koreans, and the reaction only intensified when it was discovered that Kim Sun-Jong, one of Hwang's researchers from MizMedi, was coerced by illegal means to testify against Hwang. As a result, the scheduled broadcast was canceled and the network even made a public apology to the nation, everyone more or less operating under the assumption that the show was at fault and not Hwang. Yet, other news outlets began to question Hwang's claims.

Close scrutiny revealed that several of the photos of purportedly different cells were in fact photos of the same cell. Hwang responded that these additional photos were accidentally included and that there was no such duplication in the original submission to ''Science''. This was later confirmed by the journal.

Researchers raised questions about striking similarities between the [[DNA|DNA profiles]] of the cloned cells. Then collaborator Gerald Schatten asked ''Science'' to remove his name from the paper, stating as a reason that there were "allegations from someone involved with the experiments that certain elements of the report may be fabricated."

In the midst of national confusion, Hwang disappeared from public sight, to be hospitalized days later for alleged stress-related fatigue, while public opinion gradually began to turn against Hwang with even the major Korean companies who pulled their support from "PD Su-Cheop" reportedly now less than pleased with Hwang. Days later, Hwang started going to his laboratory while requesting Seoul National University to officially conduct a probe to the allegations surrounding him.

The scandal took a dramatic turn on December 15, when Roh Sung-il, who collaborated on that paper, stated to media outlets that nine of those eleven lines had been faked; specifically, [[DNA test]]s illustrated that those nine lines shared identical [[DNA]], implying that they had come from the same source. Roh stated that "Professor Hwang admitted to fabrication", and that he, Hwang, and another co&amp;ndash;author had asked ''Science'' to withdraw the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4532128.stm | title=S Korea stem cell success 'faked' | publisher=BBC | date=December 15, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506191557/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4532128.stm |archivedate=2013-05-06 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding fuel to the fire, MBC broadcast the content of the canceled ''PD Su-cheop'' show, which substantiated Roh's claim.

On the same day, [[The Seattle Times]] reported that ''Science'' had not yet received an official request from Hwang to withdraw the paper, and it had refused to remove Schatten's name from the paper, stating, "No single author, having declared at the time of submission his full and complete confidence in the contents of the paper, can retract his name unilaterally, after publication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002682435_cloning14.html |title=Researcher tries to distance himself from cloning work |author=Elias, Paul |agency=Associated Press |date=December 14, 2005 |work=The Seattle Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503145618/http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002682435_cloning14.html |archivedate=2014-05-03 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several prominent scientists, including [[Ian Wilmut]], who cloned [[Dolly the sheep]] in 1996, and [[Robert Lanza|Bob Lanza]], a cloning expert based in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], did call on Hwang to submit his paper to an outside group for independent analysis. Lanza noted, "You can't fake the results if they're carried out by an independent group. I think this simple test could put the charges to rest."

Two major [[press conference]]s were held on Korean [[television network|networks]] on December 16, one with Hwang followed by the other with his former [[colleague]], Roh Sung-il. Hwang started his press conference by claiming that the technology to make stem cells exists, which is not an explicit statement that the stem cell lines he featured in his paper to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' were not fakes. He, however, acknowledged the falsifications of research data in the paper, attributing them to unrecoverable "artificial mistakes." He said that there was a problem with the original lines caused by [[Infection|contamination]], and if he were given ten more days he could re-create the stem cell lines. He accused Dr. Kim Sun-Jong, a former collaborator, of "switching" some of the stem cell lines.

Despite Hwang's claim, in another press conference held only minutes later, Roh Sung-il rebutted Hwang's accusation, saying Hwang was blackmailing MizMedi and Kim Sun-jong. He maintained that at least nine of the eleven [[stem cell]] lines were fakes and that Hwang is simply untrustworthy.

"Roh Sung-il, chairman of the board at Mizmedi Hospital, told [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] television that Hwang had agreed to ask the journal Science to withdraw the paper, published in June to international acclaim. Roh was one of the co-authors of the article that detailed how individual stem cell colonies were created for 11 patients through cloning. Roh also told [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] television that Hwang had pressured a former scientist at his lab to fake data to make it look like there were 11 stem cell colonies. In a separate report, a former researcher told [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] that Hwang ordered him to fabricate photos to make it appear there were 11 separate colonies from only three. [...] University of Pittsburgh researcher Gerald Schatten has already asked that Science remove him as the senior author of the report, citing questions about the paper's accuracy. Seoul National University announced this week it would conduct an internal probe into Hwang's research."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-12-15-stem-cells_x.htm | title=Cloning pioneer to withdraw paper, doctor says |work=USAToday |date=December 15, 2005 |agency=Associated Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503122036/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-12-15-stem-cells_x.htm |archivedate=2014-05-03 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists have started questioning Hwang's earlier work published in ''Science'' in February 2004 in which he claimed to have cloned embryonic stem cells. Maria Biotech head Park Se-pill said, "Up until now, I have believed Hwang did derive cloned embryonic stem cells although he admitted to misconduct in his follow-up paper on patient-specific stem cells...Now, I am not sure whether the cloned stem cell really existed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/tech/200512/kt2005121916411411780.htm |title=Hwang’s 2004 Paper May Be Fabrication |date=December 19, 2005 |author=Kim Tae-gyu |work=The Korea Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230170320/http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/tech/200512/kt2005121916411411780.htm |archivedate=2005-12-30 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2006, Hwang said in testimony that he spent part of 500 million won in private donations in attempts to clone extinct Russian mammoths and Korean tigers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.kbs.co.kr/news/newsview_sub.php?menu=6&amp;key=2006072630 |title=Disgraced Hwang Tried to Clone Mammoth, Tiger |date=July 26, 2006 |work=KBS Global |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101094402/http://english.kbs.co.kr/news/newsview_sub.php?menu=6&amp;key=2006072630 |archivedate=2007-11-01 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official probe by Seoul National University and the confirmation of fraud===
An internal panel was set up in Seoul National University to investigate the allegation, and the probe was started on December 17, 2005. The panel sealed off Hwang's laboratory and conducted a thorough investigation, collecting testimonies from Hwang, Roh and other people that were involved with the scandal. On December 23, the panel announced its initial finding that Hwang had intentionally fabricated stem cell research results creating nine fake cell lines out of eleven, and added that the validity of two remaining cell lines is yet to be confirmed. The panel stated that Hwang's misconduct is "a grave act damaging the foundation of science." Hwang's claim of having used only 185 eggs to create stem cell lines was also denied by the panel, which indicated that more eggs may have been used in the research process.

The panel announced additional findings on December 29, and confirmed that there are no patient-matched embryonic stem cells in existence and that Hwang's team doesn't have the scientific data to prove any of the stem cells have ever been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4566154.stm | title=New blow to S Korea clone work | date=December 29, 2005 | publisher=BBC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105132311/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4566154.stm |archivedate=2006-01-05 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its final report published on January 10, 2006, the panel reaffirmed its previous findings while announcing additional discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snu.ac.kr:6060/sc_sne_b/news/1196178_3497.html |title=Summary of the Final Report on Hwang's Research Allegation |publisher=Seoul National University Investigation Committee |date=January 10, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117034101/http://www.snu.ac.kr:6060/sc_sne_b/news/1196178_3497.html |archivedate=2006-01-17 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel found out that, contrary to Hwang's claim of having used 185 eggs for his team's 2005 paper, at least 273 eggs were shown to have been used according to research records kept in Hwang's lab. In addition, the panel discovered that Hwang's team was supplied with 2,061 eggs in the period of November 28, 2002 to December 8, 2005. Hwang's claim of not having known about the donation of eggs by his own female researchers was also denied by the panel; in fact, it was discovered that Hwang himself had distributed egg donation consent forms to his researchers and personally escorted one to the MizMedi Hospital to perform the egg extraction procedure.

The panel stated that Hwang's 2004 Science paper was also fabricated and decided the stem cell discussed in the paper may have been generated by a case of [[Parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic process]] (which is itself a significant development, as mammals rarely reproduce by parthenogenesis; in addition, this would make Hwang's lab the first ever to successfully generate human stem cells via parthenogenesis, predating other research facilities' successes).&lt;ref&gt;Minkel, JR. "Korean Cloned Human Cells Were Product of 'Virgin Birth.' Scientific American, 2007 August. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/korean-cloned-human-cells/&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hwang's team didn't rule out the possibility of parthenogenetic process in the paper, the panel said, his team didn't make any conscientious effort to probe the possibility through the tests available.

Chung Myunghee, the head of the panel, said at a news conference that the panel is not in a position to investigate Hwang's claim of his stem cells having been switched with MizMedi's, but added that such a claim is incomprehensible when there is no data to prove any of the stem cells were ever made to begin with.

The panel, in conclusion, stated that Hwang's team intentionally fabricated the data in both the 2004 and the 2005 papers and that it is "an act of deception targeted to both scientific community and general public." However, the panel confirmed that Hwang's team actually succeeded in cloning a dog they named [[Snuppy]]. (See also ''Nature'' 439:122-123)

===Hwang's announcement of resignation and the official dismissal===
On December 23, 2005 Hwang apologized for "creating a shock and a disappointment" and announced that he was resigning his position as professor at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB113531801709730403 |title=Fraud Allegations Deal New Setback To Cloning Effort|date=December 24, 2005 |author=Fairclough, Gordon |author2=Regalado, Antonio |work=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hwang maintained that patient-matched stem cell technology remains in South Korea, and his countrymen shall see it.

Seoul National University said Hwang's resignation request will not be accepted, citing a university regulation that dictates an employee under investigation may not resign from a post. This regulation is effected to prevent premature resignations by investigated employees, which would allow them to avoid full retributions according to the findings of the investigation (and perhaps avoid involuntary termination), while reaping the benefits of the more honorable and lucrative voluntary resignation.

On February 9, 2006, the university suspended Hwang's position as the university's professor, together with six other faculty members who participated in Hwang's team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4697210.stm | publisher=BBC | title=S Korea cloning expert suspended | date=10 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803135000/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4697210.stm |archivedate=2012-08-03 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Hwang was dismissed from the university on March 20, 2006.

===The indictment of Hwang and five of his collaborators===
On May 12, 2006, Hwang was indicted on charges of [[fraud]], [[embezzlement]] and breach of the country's [[bioethics]] law, without physical [[Detention (Imprisonment)|detention]]. Prosecutors also brought fraud charges against the three stem cell researchers. He embezzled 2.8 billion won ($3 million) out of some 40 billion won in research funds for personal purposes and the illegal purchase of ova used in his experiments.

The prosecution also said Hwang's three associates involved in his stem cell research, [[Yoon Hyun-soo]], [[Lee Byeong-chun]] and [[Kang Sung-keun]], also misappropriated tens of millions of won in research money. Investigators have been tracking 24.6 billion won to find out how the research money was spent. It was part of Hwang's 36.9 billion won research funds raised through state support and private donations. Investigators said Hwang used bank accounts held by relatives and subordinates in 2002 and 2003 to receive about 475 million won from private organizations. He allegedly laundered the money by withdrawing it all in cash, breaking it up into smaller amounts and putting it back in various bank accounts. Hwang also withdrew 140 million won in August 2001 to buy gifts for his sponsors, including politicians and other prominent social figures, before [[Chusok]] holidays, according to prosecutors. He also allegedly misappropriated around 26 million won in research funds in September 2004 to buy a car for his wife. Hwang is suspected of embezzling 600 million won, provided by a private foundation, on multiple occasions from 2001 to 2005 for personal use. Prosecutors are also accusing him of illegally paying some 38 million won to 25 women who provided ova for his research through Hanna Women's Clinic in the first eight months of 2005. They also said Hwang gave several dozen politicians about 55 million won in political funds on numerous occasions from 2001 to 2005. He allegedly provided 14 million won to executives of large companies that provided financial support for his research. The prosecution added Hwang wired about 200 million won to a Korean American, identified only as Kang, in September 2005 and received the equivalent amount in U.S. currency from him when the scientist visited the United States two months later. Also in 2005, Hwang received one billion won each in research funds from [[SK Group]] and the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation based on his fabricated stem cell research results. Meanwhile, investigators said Lee Byeong-chun and Kang Sung-keun, both professors of [[veterinary science]] at Seoul National University, embezzled about 300 million won and 100 million won each in state funds by inflating research-related expenses. Yoon Hyun-soo, a biology professor at [[Hanyang University]], also embezzled 58 million won from the research fund managed by [[MizMedi Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=115&amp;oid=214&amp;aid=0000004835|title=A charge of fraud, Lee byung-chun, Kang sung-geun, Yoon hyun-soo|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parthenogenesis==

On August 2, 2007, after much independent investigation, it was revealed that Hwang's team succeeded in extracting cells from eggs that had undergone [[parthenogenesis]]. Hwang claimed he and his team had extracted stem cells from cloned human embryos. However, further examination of the cells' chromosomes shows the same indicators of parthenogenesis in those extracted stem cells as are found in the mice created by Tokyo scientists in 2004. Although Hwang deceived the world about being the first to create artificially cloned human embryos, he did contribute a major breakthrough to the field of stem cell research. The process may offer a way for creating stem cells that are genetically matched to a particular woman for the treatment of degenerative diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.com/2007/08/03/hwang_parthenogenesis/ |title=Stem cell fraudster made 'virgin birth' breakthrough |work=The Register |author=Williams, Christoper |date=August 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223185237/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/03/hwang_parthenogenesis/ |archivedate=2007-12-23 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The news of the breakthrough came just a month after an announcement from the [[International Stem Cell Corporation]] (ISC), a California-based stem cell research company, that they had successfully created the first human embryos through parthenogenesis. Although the actual results of Hwang's work were just published, those embryos were created by him and his team before February 2004, when the fabricated cloning results were announced, which would make them the first to successfully perform the process. Jeffrey Janus, president and director of research for ISC, agrees that "Dr. Hwang's cells have characteristics found in parthenogenetic cells" but remains cautious, saying "it needs more study."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==South Korea's response to controversies==

===South Korean government's involvement in the scandal===
After having acquired a celebrity status in South Korea, Hwang actively sought to establish every possible tie to political and economic institutions in the country. Hwang especially tried to win favor from the [[Roh Moo-hyun]] government, which in turn was suffering from a lack of popular support and wanted to demonstrate its competency by creating and promoting an exemplary policy success.

Hwang approached Park Ki-young, a former biology professor, then appointed as the Information, Science and Technology Advisor for the President, and put her as one of the co-authors in his 2004 ''Science'' paper. Ties with Park yielded a favorable environment for Hwang in the government, as a non-official group consisting of high-ranking government officials was created to support Hwang's research that includes not only Hwang and Park, but also Kim Byung-joon, Chief National Policy Secretary, and Jin Dae-je, Information and Communications Minister. The group was dubbed as "''Hwang-kum-pak-chui''", a loose [[acronym]] made from each member's family names, which means "golden [[bat]]" in Korean.

After Hwang's paper was published in ''Science'' in 2005, support for Hwang came in full swing. In June 2005, the Ministry of Science and Technology selected Hwang as the first recipient of the title [[Supreme Scientist]], an honor worth US$15 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/section-010100007/2005/06/010100007200506241345557.html ‘제1호 최고과학자’에 황우석 교수 : 과학 : IT과학 : 인터넷한겨레&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Hwang, having already claimed the title of [[POSCO]] Chair Professor worth US$1.5 million, secured more than US$27 million worth of support in that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chosun.com/politics/news/200512/200512210305.html 정부 98년 이후 황우석 지원금 658억원 - 조선닷컴&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

President Roh had been [[acquaintance|acquainted]] with Hwang since 2003, and made a number of comments intended to protect Hwang from potential [[bioethics|bioethical issues]]. On June 18, 2004, Roh awarded Hwang a medal and said, "it is not possible nor desirable to prohibit research, just because there are concerns that it may lead to a direction that is deemed unethical." In another instance at the opening of [[World Stem Cell Hub]] on October 19, 2005, Roh remarked, "politicians have a responsibility to manage bioethical controversies not to get in the way of this outstanding research and progress."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressian.com/scripts/section/article.asp?article_num=60051215234251&amp;s_menu=%C1%A4%C4%A1 '황우석 광풍', '노 대통령의 입'이 자초한 일이다&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] 프레시안&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2005, after ''PD Su-cheop'' stirred a national controversy, [[Cheong Wa Dae]] reaffirmed its unflinching support for Hwang and his research team. Roh said, "We'll continue to support Professor Hwang. We hope he will return to his research lab soon for the sake of people with physical difficulties and the public", according to presidential spokesman Kim Man-soo.

While implying the controversies over [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC-TV's]] forceful methods used to gather information from Hwang's former junior staff members, Roh said, "The disputes will be resolved gradually and naturally through following scientific research and study. We hope the ongoing disputes over Hwang's achievement will be settled without further trouble."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.korea.net/news/news/newsView.asp?serial_no=20051205029 |title=Cheong Wa Dae reaffirms support for Hwang Woo-suk | work=Korea.net |date=December 6, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119051516/http://www.korea.net/news/news/newsView.asp?serial_no=20051205029 |archivedate=2007-11-19 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was alleged that advisor Park Ki-young deliberately avoided to report Roh about details of Hwang's allegation for misconduct, while emphasizing a breach of journalist ethics by MBC. Park, after weeks of silence for her role in the controversy, announced her intent to resign from the advisor post on January 10, 2006.

On January 11, 2006, the national post office stopped selling post stamps commemorating Hwang's research. The title of Supreme Scientist awarded to Hwang was revoked on March 21, 2006, after Hwang was dismissed from Seoul National University the day before.

===Lawmakers’ group supporting Professor Hwang Woo-suk===
On December 6, 2005 a group of 43 [[lawmaker]]s from the ruling and opposition parties  inaugurated a body to support  Hwang Woo-suk. Members of the group, dubbed the "lawmakers' group supporting Professor Hwang Woo-suk", pledged to help Hwang continue his experiments in pursuit of a scientific breakthrough.

"There are many lawmakers who, regardless of party affiliation, want to support Hwang. We will join forces to help Hwang devote himself to his studies", [[Legislator|Rep.]] Kwon Sun-taik of the ruling [[Uri Party]] said in a news conference at the National Assembly, who was also the leader of the group.

He said the group will seek to establish [[bioethics]] guidelines and come up with supporting measures for biotechnology researchers in the country. Among those who have joined the group were Reps. Kim Hyuk-kyu, Kim Young-choon and Kim Sung-gon of the ruling party, Kim Hyong-o of the main opposition [[Grand National Party]] (GNP) and Kim Hak-won, chairman of the [[United Liberal Democrats]].

Some female lawmakers participated in a civic group for voluntary egg donations for therapeutic research, which opened in November 2005 following the egg procurement scandal.

Reps. Song Young-sun and Chin Soo-hee of the GNP said they would provide their eggs to Hwang’s research team. Meanwhile, the ruling and opposition parties called on the Korean Broadcasting Commission to thoroughly investigate the staffers of MBCs PD Notebook, which broadcast a documentary program critical of Hwang with coercive tactics in interviews, and reprimand them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120719093614/http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/nation/200512/kt2005120617530311990.htm Page Error : 찾으시는 Page의 URL이 잘못되었거나 없습니다&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After most of Hwang's claims were confirmed fake on January 10, 2006, some lawmakers revealed that Hwang made several campaign donations to them and other lawmakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/kisa/section-001001000/2006/01/001001000200601101755311.html 황우석 ‘정치 후원금’…정계 ‘긴장’ : 정치일반 : 정치 : 뉴스 : 한겨레&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return of PD Notebook to the air in 2006===
The [[investigative journalism]] show [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] ''[[PD Notebook]]'' (Korean: PD수첩) returned on air on January 3, 2006, and summarized the course of Hwang's scandal to date. The show had been cancelled under pressure after it aired its show on November 22 that accused Hwang of oddities in his research. The last show in 2005, aired on November 29, covered other topics. It remained off the air for five weeks. The second show in 2006, on January 10, dealt further with the Hwang affair, focusing on several instances of Hwang's [[Spin (public relations)|media spinning]] tactics. It also covered the unwillingness on the part of a significant part of the public in South Korea to believe that someone who had almost achieved a status of a national hero committed such a shame.

===Rallies supporting Hwang===
The same day many South Korean citizens rallied outside Hwang's laboratory; as more than 1,000 women pledged to donate their eggs for the scientist's research. [ ... ] Hwang has been in [[solitude|seclusion]] since apologizing in November 2005, for ethical lapses in human egg procurement for his research. The symbolic event was as a gesture from Hwang's supporters that says they intend to donate their eggs with 1,000 of their members after they took egg-donation pledges online via their website. "Dr. Hwang will not be able to return to the lab, at least, until at the end of this week because he is extremely exhausted, mentally and physically", a key team member, Ahn Cu Rie, wrote in an [[e-mail]] to [[Reuters]]. [ ... ] At Hwang's lab at Seoul National University, women left bouquets of the national flower, a [[hibiscus]] called the [[Hibiscus syriacus|Rose of Sharon]], for the scientist along with notes of encouragement.

The stem cell research center that Hwang led before resigning said it hoped he would return, even though his lapses could hurt its efforts to work with other research institutions.

"So far more than 700 South Korean women have pledged to donate their eggs and the number is steadily rising", said Lee Sun-min, an official at a private foundation launched last week to promote egg donations. [ ... ] Thousands of patients have applied to participate in the research, hoping the technology could help treat damaged spinal cords or diseases such as Parkinson's. On Tuesday, an official at the lab said it was hoped that Hwang would return.

"We're waiting for Hwang to assume the leadership after some rest", Seong Myong-hoon told a news conference. But Seong said the controversy could hurt the lab. That conclusion was reached after one of Hwang's close research partners, Ahn Cu-rie, returned Tuesday after a 10-day trip to meet with scientists in the United States and Japan, Seong said.

"The reaction of foreign scientists was that they understand what Dr. Hwang disclosed, but they cannot accept that without criticism", Seong said. "We can never be optimistic about cooperation with foreign institutions."

Seong added: "Researchers of our country were newly awakened to the fact that we have to take every precaution to ensure we don't fall behind international ethics (guidelines) while researching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsgd.com/culture/culturenews/200512020019.htm |author=Wing |title=Disgraced stem cell pioneer seen as hero |date=December 2, 2005 |work=Newsgd |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224235208/http://www.newsgd.com/culture/culturenews/200512020019.htm |archivedate=2012-02-24 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The only hope for us is Dr. Hwang. Don't trample on our one shred of hope", a woman whose son suffers from a severe kidney ailment told South Korean broadcaster [[YTN]] at the university. The woman also pledged to sell her eggs to Hwang.

Hundreds of South Koreans have offered to donate eggs for stem cell research in a show of support for cloning pioneer Hwang Woo-Suk despite his admitted ethical breaches.

===Online ova donations===
A [[website]] backed by Hwang's supporters began taking egg-donation pledges online since late November 2005 after Hwang resigned all his official posts at [[World Stem Cell Hub]], relaying them to a clinic linked to Hwang's research team. The number of pledges had reached 725 by early December 2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

[[Web banner|Banners]] like "Please come back, Doctor Hwang. I'm already dying to see you, Professor Hwang", were put up on the [[Home page|homepage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cafe.daum.net/ilovehws Daum - 카페&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The site also carried a photo of Hwang and his cloned dog, [[Snuppy]], trimmed with images of the [[Hibiscus syriacus|rose of sharon]], South Korea's national flower, in an apparent appeal for [[patriotism]]. The national anthem played as background music.

Those who applied to donate ova included those with incurable [[illness]]es or their family members, who hope that Hwang's research will eventually lead to cures, as well as just ordinary young, healthy women.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">'''Jack Reiter''' (3 March 1921 – 29 October 1999) was a [[United States Air Force]] colonel, lawyer and businessman.

He was born in New York State, and excelled at sports winning championships in boxing and swimming. He later attended New York University where he received a law degree.&lt;ref name=Arlington&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jreiter.htm |title=Jack Reiter |publisher=[[Arlington National Cemetery]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He had an interest in flying and during World War II Colonel Reiter served as a B-24 Liberator [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] pilot in the [[United States Army Air Forces]], flying over North Africa and Italy. He was shot down over Foggia in Italy in 1943&lt;ref name=Ranfurly241&gt;Ranfurly p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; and taken prisoner by the Germans. He was sent to an Italian prison hospital as he had dislocated both his thighs on landing.

He later escaped from the hospital before his legs were properly mended when he learned he was being moved to Germany. He had managed to get fairly fit, but his thighs were still partly dislocated. He lived with the partisans (Garibaldi Brigade Romagna under [[Riccardo Fedel]]) in the Apennines for some months. He joined up with a group of British officers who had escaped from Castello di [[Vincigliata]] prison PG 12 camp during the Italian Armistice in September 1943. They included Brigadier ‘Rudolf’ Vaughan, Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Frederick Boyce Combe|John Combe]], Brigadier [[Edward Joseph Todhunter|‘Ted’ Todhunter]], Captain [[Guy Ruggles-Brise]] and Lieutenant [[Daniel Knox, 6th Earl of Ranfurly|‘Dan’ Ranfurly]]. In March 1944 with the help of Italian guides they walked 250 mile across the mountains to keep a rendezvous with agents on the coast. The travelling was difficult through snow, and the efforts of ‘Rudolph’ Vaughan with his game leg and Jack Reiter with his dislocated thighs became an inspiration to them all.&lt;ref name=Ranfurly241/&gt;
 
The eventually reached the coast and after unexpected delays found a fishing boat laid up on the sands. Jack and Dan Ranfurly found a mast &lt;ref&gt;Ranfurly p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; whilst others secured a rudder and oars. In May they sailed the leaking boat about seventy miles along the coast just past the front line and were taken in tow by a passing Italian fishing boat into [[Ortona]] Harbour. After he returned to the United States, he put his experience to use by training military personnel in escape and survival techniques behind enemy lines.

Colonel Reiter was later posted by the Air Force to Italy and as a senior briefing officer to General [[Curtis LeMay]] at Strategic Air Command headquarters. After leaving the Air Force in 1968,&lt;ref name=Arlington/&gt; Reiter became a member of the [[Air Force Association]] and Army Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia. He was vice president for government affairs for World Airways and the Washington representative for Flying Tigers International and Japan Airlines. He served &lt;ref&gt;http://www.aeroclub.org&lt;/ref&gt; as president of the Aero Club of Washington in 1976.

He died at the age of 78 and was survived by his wife Helen N. Reiter and two children, Allan James Reiter and Kathleen N. Ausley.&lt;ref name=Arlington/&gt;

'''John Angelo Spano Jr.''' (born May 31, 1964) is an American businessman and admitted fraudster. He is best known for briefly buying control of the [[New York Islanders]] franchise of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) in 1996, before it emerged that he did not have nearly enough assets to buy the team. He subsequently pleaded guilty to bank and wire fraud and served a federal prison sentence.

==Early life==
Spano was originally from the [[Greenwich Village]] (Manhattan, in New York City), but spent most of his life in [[Madison, Ohio]], a suburb of [[Cleveland]], and graduated from Ashtabula St. John High School. He graduated from [[Duquesne University]] with a degree in business administration in 1986. After working several sales jobs in [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Dallas]], he founded the Bison Group in 1990.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;[[Alexander Wolff|Wolff, Alexander]]. [https://www.si.com/vault/1997/08/04/230237/busted-john-spanos-giddy-run-as-an-nhl-owner-ended-quickly-amid-charges-of-fraud-and-deceit Busted]. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 1997-08-04.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a Dallas-based company that primarily leased aircraft.

==Interest in Dallas Stars==
On September 1995, he reached a tentative agreement to buy a 50 percent interest in the [[Dallas Stars]], but the date for the closing was pushed back several times, during which Spano began making what owner [[Norman Green]] called unreasonable demands. Green backed out of the deal in November, eventually selling the team to [[Tom Hicks]]. Years later, [[Jim Lites]], the Stars' president at the time, recalled visiting Spano's mansion in the Dallas suburb of [[University Park, Texas|University Park]]. Despite Spano's claimed wealth, Lites said the house was unfurnished.&lt;ref name="DalOb"&gt;Mullen, Holly. [http://www.dallasobserver.com/1997-07-31/news/meltdown-man Meltdown man]. [[Dallas Observer]], 1997-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the "laughable" excuses Spano offered were a written agreement with the team's top minor league affiliate, the [[Kalamazoo Wings (1974-2000)|Kalamazoo Wings]] and a request to have his [[South Africa]]n partners meet with Stars officials. Lites also said that Spano insisted that Lites pick up the tab for their dinners—something Lites said he'd never seen in all of his years as a sports executive.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

Spano also made an abortive bid for the [[Florida Panthers]] that year.&lt;ref name="DalOb"/&gt;

==Purchase of New York Islanders==
In October 1996, Spano agreed to buy the Islanders from longtime owner [[John Pickett (businessman)|John Pickett]] for $165 million: $80 million for Pickett's 90 percent stake in the team and $85 million for its lucrative cable television contract with [[MSG Plus|SportsChannel New York]], which at the time earned the Islanders $13 million a year. He later agreed to buy the remaining 10 percent of the team held by the management group that had been running the Islanders' day-to-day operations since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.businessinsider.com/how-john-spano-bought-the-islanders-2013-10|title= How A Con Artist With No Money Almost Managed To Buy The New York Islanders For $165 Million|author= Tony Manfred|publisher= [[Business Insider]] |date =October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spano billed himself as the owner of a leasing operation that he'd built from one company with four employees to a group of 10 companies with 6,000 employees worldwide in just six years.&lt;ref name="Fischler"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cracked Ice: An Insider's Look at the NHL |last=Fischler |first=Stan |authorlink=Stan Fischler |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher= Masters Press|location=[[Lincolnwood, Illinois]] |isbn=1-57028-219-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to be worth $230 million&lt;ref name="DalOb"/&gt; largely based on money inherited from his wealthy grandfather Angelo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1010447/2/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Video | date=July 28, 1997 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to own his University Park house free and clear; the house was supposedly worth $3 million.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

Pickett and [[NHL Commissioner]] [[Gary Bettman]] thought that Spano would be a lifesaver for the Islanders. The once-proud franchise, best known for their meteoric rise from also-ran to four-time [[Stanley Cup]] champions, had missed the playoffs in five of the last eight years. They had also been suffering at the gate, and rumors abounded that they were about to move to [[Atlanta]], [[Nashville]] or [[Houston]]. Spano promised to keep the team on Long Island and either renovate, rebuild or replace the aging [[Nassau Coliseum]]. He paid for the team at signing with a loan from a syndicate of banks headed by [[FleetBoston|Fleet Bank]]. He and Pickett agreed to a five-year installment package for the cable rights, and the league's other owners approved the sale in February 1997.

The first $16.5 million payment on the cable rights was due on April 7. The money wasn't there that day, but Spano promised Pickett it would be made, showing him a letter from [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] in [[London]] promising that the money would be wired out. This was enough to satisfy Pickett, and he closed the deal.

Even before the deal closed, Spano pumped $2.5 million into the team's payroll &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Lipsyte |authorlink=Robert Lipsyte |coauthors= |title=Spano Reflects on Deal Gone Awry, but There Is a Bright Side |work=[[New York Times]] |date=1997-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and forced head coach/general manager [[Mike Milbury]] to give his coach's role to [[Rick Bowness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Diamos |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Isles' Owner Prevails and Milbury Steps Down |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher= |date=1997-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also let it be known that he intended to be a major player in the free-agent market.

===Revealed as a swindler===
However, when the NHL's Board of Governors met in June 1997, Spano was conspicuously absent. Instead, the Islanders were represented by two men from the Pickett regime. It emerged that Spano had only paid $26,200 to Pickett for the cable rights after five attempts.&lt;ref name="Fischler"/&gt; On one attempt, he'd wired Pickett only $5,000 instead of the $5 million originally agreed upon. On another, a $17 million check had bounced. On another, he sent $1,700 when he was supposed to send the $17 million.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Pickett asked Bettman to mediate. The commissioner ordered Spano to remove himself from day-to-day control of the Islanders and not use any team assets until the dispute could be settled.&lt;ref name="Fischler"/&gt;

In early July, ''[[Newsday]],'' acting on tips from anonymous Islanders executives that their new boss was worth significantly less than advertised, began investigating Spano's background.&lt;ref name="DalOb"/&gt; On July 9, ''Newsday'' published a story that exposed Spano as a complete fraud who didn't have even a fraction of the money required to complete the Islanders deal. Among other things, the ''Newsday'' investigation revealed:

* He had grossly misrepresented his net worth: he was worth only $5 million.
* His Bison Group had 22 employees and assets of $3 million.
* He had lied about numerous items on his résumé. For instance, he had claimed to have graduated from an exclusive prep school in Ohio, but had actually graduated from a small Catholic school in suburban Cleveland.
* His "inherited wealth" did not exist; neither of his grandfathers had an estate valued at more than $246,000.

Under the terms of a mediation brokered by Bettman, Spano relinquished control of the Islanders to Pickett on July 11. In return, Pickett agreed not to sue Spano for [[breach of contract]]. Spano later told ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that a "significant" capital call and a payment on a note blew apart his plans to pay Pickett. However, he claimed that once Pickett asked Bettman to intervene and the story broke in the press, it was impossible for him to resolve the dispute.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischler"/&gt;

Immediately after the Islanders deal fell apart, it emerged that Spano owed $85,000 in back [[property tax]]es on his home.&lt;ref name="Spanofraud"&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Sandomir |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Fraud in Spano's Isles Deal, Prosecutors Say |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/24/sports/fraud-in-spano-s-isles-deal-prosecutors-say.html|work=[[New York Times]] |publisher= |date=1997-07-24 |accessdate=2008-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There had been some questions about Spano even before the Islanders deal came unraveled. He'd reportedly rubbed some of the other owners the wrong way, which held up formal approval of his purchase of the team. Then-[[New Jersey Devils]] owner [[John McMullen (engineer)|John McMullen]], for instance, told [[Stan Fischler]] (a longtime television analyst for SportsChannel New York, which owned and still owns the Islanders' TV rights under the name MSG Plus) that he wasn't sure if Spano was using his own money to buy the team. Fischler also learned that Spano had promised the leader of an Islanders fan club a post as his "special advisor," but apparently didn't tell anyone with the Islanders about it. Spano had offered the team presidency to former Islanders great [[Denis Potvin]] (who'd reportedly planned to fire Milbury altogether), but negotiations collapsed after Spano apparently told Potvin that he was running out of money.&lt;ref name="Fischler"/&gt; Potvin later said that Spano had almost no staff, which was unusual for a multimillionaire.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

Not long after Spano's cover was blown, it emerged that he was being sued by [[South Africa]]n cookware maker Lenco Holdings. Spano had reached a deal with Lenco to sell its pots and pans to American buyers at [[Nordstrom]]. However, Nordstrom, then as now, doesn't sell cookware, and the department code on the purported Nordstrom purchase order was for women's coats. Spano borrowed against the venture to secure a $1 million loan from his bank, [[Comerica]].&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; He was also being sued by a Dallas law firm after he hadn't paid it for legal work during his abortive run at the Stars. Had either of these suits come to light sooner, it is likely Spano's pursuit of the Islanders would have been over before it started.

===Arrest and incarceration===
The ''Newsday'' report revealed that a federal investigation into Spano's affairs was well underway. On July 23, federal prosecutors on [[Long Island]] charged Spano with multiple counts of [[bank fraud]], [[wire fraud]] and [[forgery]].&lt;ref name="Spanofraud"/&gt; On August 14, federal prosecutors in [[Fort Worth]] indicted Spano with additional unrelated charges of bank fraud and wire fraud for bilking two lenders out of $5.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Spano is indicted in Texas |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/14/sports/spano-is-indicted-in-texas.html|work=[[New York Times]] |publisher= |date=1997-07-24 |accessdate=2011-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, federal prosecutors in [[Boston]] (home to Fleet) began investigating Spano regarding the $80 million loan.

Prosecutors obtained evidence that Spano had forged numerous letters from bank officials in his business dealings from 1995 onward. After Spano bounced the $17 million check, Comerica reportedly sent a letter to Pickett's attorneys saying he had funds to cover the overdraft. However, the executive who purportedly signed it denied ever writing it.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Moreover, the letter was written in two different fonts, one on the body and another on the signature block. A [[United States Postal Inspection Service|postal inspector]] found that the fax machine mark at the top of the page was an exact match to the one used by Spano's Bison Group.&lt;ref name="DalOb"/&gt; The fax machine mark on a letter purportedly from [[Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette]] that claimed Spano owned [[Treasury bills]] worth $27 million was also an exact match to the one used by Bison Group.&lt;ref name="Spanofraud"/&gt;

It also emerged that many of the banks who gave money to Spano had abandoned their traditional safeguards. Fleet had relied on a letter from a Comerica senior vice president saying that Spano was worth over $100 million. This figure was based on what were later described as "unverified documents" provided by Spano.&lt;ref name="Spanofraud"/&gt; Additionally, a Dallas attorney claimed as trustee of a $107 million trust later told prosecutors he couldn't verify the trust's existence because Spano wouldn't document the funds.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The Fleet loan officer who approved the $80 million deal was forced to resign.

Spano initially fled to the [[Cayman Islands]], but eventually agreed to return to the United States. On October 8, he pleaded guilty to the charges lodged by prosecutors in Long Island and Texas. He admitted that he'd planned to defraud the Islanders and Pickett, and to forging documents.

The plea deal called for him to plead guilty to bank fraud charges in Boston a week later, but several deadlines came and went, and Spano began making noises in late November about withdrawing his plea. As a result, a Boston grand jury indicted him for bank fraud, and federal prosecutors there made plans to file a superseding indictment that could have sent him to prison for 60 years. However, Spano's new attorneys resigned out of fears they wouldn't be paid, and Spano had no choice but to accept the original offer. He pleaded guilty to bank fraud on January 13, 1998.

During 1999, his wife divorced him and sold their house, and he moved to a [[Philadelphia]] [[Condominium|condo]] where he had tried to pay the rent with an expired credit card, $10,000 in bad checks and wire transfers. This led to his arrest in February, and he lost his bail.

On January 28, 2000, he was sentenced to 71 months in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of $11.9 million to his victims, including the Islanders ($3.4 million), two Dallas businesses ($4.4 million), and [[Mario Lemieux]] ($1.25 million).

===Aftermath===
Spano was released in June 2004 on five years' supervised release and moved to a Cleveland suburb. However, he was arrested again in February 2005 for defrauding numerous companies by promising to obtain loans for them and pocketing the fees without getting the loans. He was jailed for 51 months and released from prison on April 3, 2009.

On August 20, 2014, Spano was indicted by a grand jury in Ohio on one count of theft and 44 counts of forgery. In a scheme that took place from June 2011 until July 2013, Spano stole from his employers Image First, which rents linens to outpatient facilities in Ohio, and its sister company London Cleaners. He pleaded guilty to charges of collecting almost $70,000 in commissions on fraudulent accounts in May 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Man who scammed NHL pleads guilty to forgery charges in Ohio|author=Gillipsie, M.|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/man-scammed-nhl-pleads-guilty-forgery-charges-ohio-140613921--nhl.html|publisher=Yahoo!|date=May 18, 2015|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sentenced to 10 years prison on June 17, 2015. He was also ordered to pay more than $75,000 in restitution to Image First.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-herald.com/general-news/20150618/grand-river-man-who-scammed-nhl-gets-10-years-in-prison-for-lake-county-charges|title=Grand River man who scammed NHL gets 10 years in prison for Lake County charges|date=18 June 2015|access-date=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Spano fiasco was highly embarrassing to the NHL, which was still reeling from revelations that former [[NHL Players' Association|NHLPA]] head [[Alan Eagleson]] had lied to his clients and enriched himself by skimming off the union's pension fund. The NHL was particularly shaken after it was revealed that it spent well under $1,000 evaluating Spano's credentials (estimates range from $525&lt;ref name="Fischler"/&gt; to $750&lt;ref name="DalOb"/&gt;); most leagues spend well over $30,000 to evaluate prospective team owners. When Spano bid for the Stars, the team was satisfied by a letter supposedly from Comerica attesting to his net worth. Prospective NHL owners are now vetted by [[Ernst and Young]] and a New York City accounting firm.

These safeguards were not enough, however, to prevent [[John Rigas]] from buying the [[Buffalo Sabres]] in 1997, only to have the league take over the franchise after his 2002 arrest for fraud. In 2007 the [[Nashville Predators]] were sold to a group that included a nearly 30% share to [[Nashville Predators#Del Biaggio fraud|William "Boots" Del Biaggio III]], who was later revealed to have fraudulently obtained $110 million in loans from two NHL owners and eight banks in order to purchase a stake in the Predators, a crime for which he was sentenced to eight years in prison
on September 8, 2009 and ordered to sell his share of the team.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-biaggio9-2009sep09,0,1163480.story|title=Financier William 'Boots' Del Biaggio III sentenced for bilking investors, banks|date=Sep 9, 2009|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/article/692788 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | title=It's down to two: Jim Balsillie vs. NHL | first=Kevin | last=McGran | date=September 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several attempts at interviews and possible documentaries, an [[ESPN]] ''[[30 for 30]]'' film, ''Big Shot'', directed by actor [[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]], related John Spano's time as prospective owner of the New York Islanders and Spano himself appeared in the film to explain his actions.

'''Karva Chauth''' is a one-day festival celebrated by [[Hindu]] women four days after purnima (a [[full moon]]) in the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]]. Dates differ according to the [[Gregorian calendar]] which is tabular and not based according to constellations. Karva Chauth, like many Hindu festivals, is based on the [[lunisolar calendar]] which accounts for all astronomical positions, especially positions of the moon which is used as a marker to calculate important dates. 

On Karva Chauth women, especially in [[North India|Northern India]], who are married [[Fasting|fast]] from sunrise to moonrise for the safety and longevity of their husbands.&lt;ref name="ref25lojir"&gt;{{Citation | title=Let's Know Festivals of India | author=Kartar Singh Bhalla | publisher=Star Publications, 2005 | isbn=978-81-7650-165-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WORYY5Vl0ygC | quote=''...

==Etymology and origins==
''Karva'' is another word for '[[Pottery|pot]]' (a small earthen pot of water) and ''chauth'' means 'fourth' in [[Hindi]] (a reference to the fact that the festival falls on the fourth day of the dark-fortnight, or ''krishna [[paksha|paksh]]'', of the month of ''Kartik'').&lt;ref name="ref31vefox"&gt;{{Citation | title=Rural Sociology | author=Rajendra Kumar Sharma | publisher=Atlantic Publishers, 2004 | isbn=978-81-7156-671-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cq99HbGpIWsC | quote="... small earthen-ware pots called 'deep' being filled with oil and lighted through a wick ..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival originated and came to be celebrated only in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. Karwa Chauth is celebrated in Northern India. One hypothesis is that military campaigns were often conducted by men in far off places whereby men would often leave their wives and children to go off to war. Their wives would often pray for their safe return.  The festival also coincides with the wheat-sowing time (i.e., the beginning of the [[Rabi crop]] cycle). Big earthen pots in which wheat is stored are sometimes called ''Karvas'', so the fast may have begun as a prayer for a good harvest in this predominantly wheat-eating region.&lt;ref name="ref33fabuf"&gt;{{Citation |title = History of Ancient India: From 7300 BC to 4250 BC|author = J.P. Mittal|publisher = Atlantic Publishers &amp;amp; Distributors, 2006|isbn = 978-81-269-0615-4|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b7gOBW8oDFgC|quote = "... military campaigns and foreign travels were undertaken after the rainy season ... It is also the season for sowing wheat, which is kept in the Karva (Round Vessel) ..."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another story about the origin of this festival relates to the bond of feminine friendship. With the custom of [[arranged marriage]] being prevalent, the [[newlywed]] bride would reside with her husband and the in-laws. Everyone being a stranger to her, the custom arose of befriending another woman as her friend (''kangan-saheli'') or sister (''dharam-behn'') for life. Their friendship would be sanctified through a Hindu ritual during the marriage ceremony itself. The bride's friend would usually be of the same age (or slightly older), typically married into the same village (so that she would not go away) and not directly related to her in-laws (so there was no conflict of interest later). This emotional and psychological bond would be considered akin to a blood relationship. It is said that Karva Chauth festival evolved to include celebrating this special bond of friendship. 

A few days before Karva Chauth, married women would buy new ''karvas'' (spherical clay pots) -- 7"-9" in diameter and 2-3 litres capacity—and paint them on the outside with beautiful designs. Inside they would put bangles and ribbons, home-made candy and sweets, make-up items, and small clothes. The women would then visit each other on the day of Karva Chauth and exchange these ''karvas''.

Women begin preparing for ''Karva Chauth'' a few days in advance, by buying adornments (shringar), jewelry, and puja items, such as the ''Karva'' lamps, ''matthi'', [[henna]] and the decorated puja ''thali'' (plate).&lt;ref name="webdunia2009kdyr"&gt;{{Citation | title=ਕਰਵਾ ਚੌਥ - ਫਿਲਮੀ ਨਾਮਾਂ ਵਾਲੀਆਂ ਚੂੜੀਆਂ ਦਾ ਕ੍ਰੇਜ (Karva Chauth - The craze for bangles named after movies) | date=Oct 6, 2009 | newspaper=Webdunia Punjabi | url=http://punjabi.webdunia.com/newsworld/news/features/0910/06/1091006026_1.htm | quote=''... ਕਰਵਾ ਚੌਥ ਦੇ ਆਉਂਦੇ ਹੀ ਬਜ਼ਾਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੀ ਚਹਿਲ-ਪਹਿਲ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ। ਇਸੇ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਸਿਲਸਿਲਾ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਸਾਜ-ਸ਼ਿੰਗਾਰ ਦਾ ਸਮਾਨ ਖਰੀਦਣ ਦਾ। ਜਿਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਚੂੜੀਆਂ ਇਸਤਰੀਆਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਪਸੰਦੀਦਾ ਹੁੰਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ। ਆਪਣੇ ਸੂਟ ਜਾਂ ਸਾੜੀ ਨਾਲ ਮੈਚ ਕਰਦੀਆਂ ਚੂੜੀਆਂ ਲਈ ਬਜ਼ਾਰ 'ਚ ਪਤਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਕਿੰਨੇ ਗੇੜੇ ਮਾਰਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ।  (The coming of Karva Chauth gets the bazaars humming with activity.

In Uttar Pradesh, celebrants eat ''soot feni'' with milk in sugar on the eve of the festival. It is said that this helps them go without water the next day. In Punjab, ''sargi'' (ਸਰਗੀ) is an important part of this pre-dawn meal and always includes ''[[Fenia (food)|fenia]]''. It is traditional for the ''sargi'' to be sent or given to the fasting woman by her mother-in-law. If she lives with her mother-in-law, the pre-dawn meal is prepared by the mother-in-law. On Karwa Chauth occasion, fasting women choose to wear karva chauth special dresses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popxo.com/2016/10/karva-chauth-outfit-ideas/|title=15 Stunning Outfits For Your *First* Karva Chauth!|date=2018|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  like a traditional saari or lehenga to look their best. In some regions, women wear traditional dresses of their states.

The fast begins at dawn. Fasting women do not eat during the day. In traditional observances of the fast, the fasting woman usually does no housework. &lt;ref name="ref98mabub"&gt;{{Citation | title=Dance, Human Rights, and Social Justice: Dignity in Motion |author1=Naomi Jackson |author2=Toni Shapiro-Phim | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008 | isbn=978-0-8108-6149-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMwHUUreHCgC | quote=''... several Indian feminists have talked about the ways in which Indian, specifically Hindu, women have found it empowering to hold onto religious practices ... the Karvachauth ... meant that she had a day off once a year and a new sari at the end of it ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women apply [[Henna#Use of henna as body art|henna]] and other cosmetics to themselves and each other. The day passes in meeting friends and relatives. In some regions, it is customary to give and exchange painted clay pots filled with put bangles, ribbons, home-made candy, cosmetics and small cloth items (e.g., handkerchiefs). Since ''Karva Chauth'' follows soon after the [[Kharif crop|''Kharif'' crop harvest]] in the rural areas, it is a good time for community festivities and gift exchanges. Parents often send gifts to their married daughters and their children.

In the evening, a community women-only ceremony is held. Participants dress in fine clothing and wear [[jewellery]] and henna, and (in some regions) dress in the complete finery of their wedding dresses.&lt;ref name="ref38bequf"&gt;{{Citation | title=Indian and foreign review, Volume 23 | author=Publications Division | publisher=Publications Division of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India, 1985 | isbn= | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4FVDAAAAYAAJ | quote=''... the typically North Indian festival of Karva Chauth when wives fast for the longevity of their husbands.

The fasters sit in a circle with their puja thalis. Depending on region and community, a version of the story of ''Karva Chauth'' is narrated, with regular pauses. The storyteller is usually an older woman or a priest, if one is present.&lt;ref name="ref15zezuv"&gt;{{Citation | title=Hindu Vrat Kathayen | author=A.H.W.

The first six describe some of the activities that are taboo during the fast and the seventh describes the lifting of those restrictions with the conclusion of the fast. The forbidden activities include weaving cloth (''kumbh chrakhra feri naa''), pleading with or attempting to please anyone (''ruthda maniyen naa''), and awakening anyone who is asleep (''suthra jagayeen naa''). For the first six ''feris'' they sing

{{cquote|''...Veero kudiye Karvara, Sarv suhagan Karvara, Aye katti naya teri naa, Kumbh chrakhra feri naa, Aar pair payeen naa, Ruthda maniyen naa, Suthra jagayeen naa, Ve veero kuriye Karvara, Ve sarv suhagan Karvara...''}}

For the seventh ''feri'', they sing

{{cquote|''...Veero kudiye Karvara, Sarv suhagan Karvara, Aye katti naya teri nee, Kumbh chrakhra feri bhee, Aar pair payeen bhee, Ruthda maniyen bhee, Suthra jagayeen bhee, Ve veero kuriye Karvara, Ve sarv suhagan Karvara...''}}

In Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, participants exchange ''Karvas'' seven times between themselves. In Rajasthan, before offering water seven times the fasting woman is asked "''Dhapi ki Ni Dhapi?''" (are you satiated?), to which she responds, "''Jal se Dhapi, Suhaag se na Dhapi''" (I am satiated by water, but not from [love of] my husband). An alternative ritual conducted by Uttar Pradeshis is prayer of "gaur mata" the earth. Specifically, celebrants will take a bit of soil, sprinkle water, and then place kumkum on it, treating it as an idol/manifestation of the fertile Mother Earth.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In Rajasthan, stories are told by older women in the family, including narratives of Karva Chauth, [[Shiva|Shiv]], [[Parvati]] and [[Ganesh]]. In earlier times, an idol of [[Gaur Mata]] was made using earth and cow dung, which has now been replaced with an idol of Parvati. Each fasting woman lights an earthen lamp in her ''thali'' while listening to the Karva story. Sindoor, incense sticks and rice are also kept in the ''thali''.

In Uttar Pradesh, a priest or an elderly woman of the family narrates the story of ''beejabeti'' or [[Karva Chauth#The Story of Queen Veervati|Veervati]]. Celebrants make ''Gauri'', ''Ganesh'' and ''Shankar'' idols with mud and decorate them with colourful and bright clothes and jewellery. While exchanging ''Karvas'' seven times, they sing

{{cquote|''...Sadaa suhagan karve lo, Pati ki pyari karve lo, Saat bhaiyon ke behen karve lo, Vart karni karve lo, Saas ki pyaari karve lo...''}}

Thereafter, the fasters offer ''baayna'' (a melange of goodies like [[Halva|halwa]], [[Poori|puri]], namkeen [[mathri]], ''meethi mathri'', etc.) to the idols (''mansana'') and hand over to their mother-in-law or sister-in-law.

The ''fera'' ceremony concluded, the women await the rising of the moon. Once the moon is visible, depending on the region and community, it is customary for a fasting woman, to view moon or its reflection in a vessel filled with water, through a [[sieve]], or through the cloth of a [[dupatta]]. Water is offered ([[Surya#Arka form|arka]]) to the moon (''[[Soma (deity)|som]]'' or ''[[chandra]]'', the lunar deity) to secure its blessings. In some regions, the woman says a brief prayer asking for her husband's life. It is believed that at this stage, spiritually strengthened by her fast, the woman can successfully confront and defeat death (personified by [[Yama]]). In Rajasthan the women say "Like the gold necklace and the pearl bracelet, just like the moon may my suhaag always shine brightly."

Her husband then takes the water from the ''thali'' and offers it to his wife; taking her first sip of water during the day, the fast is now broken and the woman can have a complete meal.&lt;ref name="ref98mabub"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref15zezuv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref72zuyax"&gt;{{Citation | title=The nation, the state, and Indian identity | author=Madhusree Dutta, Neera Adarkar, Majlis Organization (Bombay) | publisher=Popular Prakashan, 1996 | isbn=978-81-85604-09-1 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=clVkXbbcrhIC | quote=''... originally was practised by women in Punjab and parts of UP, is gaining tremendous popularity ...

==Popular cultural aspects and critiques==
In modern North India and [[Northwestern India]] society, ''Karva Chauth'' is considered to be a romantic festival, symbolizing the love between a husband and wife.&lt;ref name="ref53jovax"&gt;{{Citation | title=Winning in the Indian Market: Understanding the Transformation of Consumer India | author=Rama Bijapurkar | publisher=John Wiley and Sons, 2007 | isbn=978-0-470-82199-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1B4fhk9Wsj4C | quote="...

Thanks to the [[Bollywood]], Karwa Chauth isn’t limited to be a North Indian or [[Punjabis|Punjabi]] festival anymore. It is now glamorized and widely popular function in India. Every married woman and a bride-to-be wants to look her best on this day when she fasts for the well-being of her husband.  The evening is the time when the drudgery of fast starts wearing off and the enthusiasm and expectation of golden moments show on their faces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bharatsthali.com/blog/karwachauth-special-sarees-look-your-best/ Karwa chauth Traditional Look] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626075414/https://www.bharatsthali.com/blog/karwachauth-special-sarees-look-your-best/ |date=26 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''Karva Chauth'' is celebrated primarily by women (men are entirely excluded from the festival's observances until moonrise, though they are expected to demonstrate attention and concern for their fasting wives) and because beauty rituals and dressing-up are a significant part of the day, the festival is seen as an event that bonds women together.&lt;ref name="webdunia2009gqw"&gt;{{Citation | title=करवा चौथ का श्रृंगार (Beauty treatments for Karva Chauth) | date=Oct 7, 2009 | author=Naynika Mehra | newspaper=Webdunia Hindi | url=http://hindi.webdunia.com/miscellaneous/woman/articles/0910/07/1091007022_1.htm | quote=''... सुंदर और आकर्षक कपड़ों-गहनों के साथ ही श्रृंगार का भी उत्सवों पर एक अलग ही आनंद आ जाता है। उस पर भी यदि बात करवा चौथ जैसे त्योहार की हो तो बनने-सँवरने का उत्साह चरम पर पहुँच जाता है। हर महिला इस दिन कुछ अलग दिखना चाहती है। आइए हम देते हैं कुछ टिप्स इस करवा चौथ पर ताकि आप दिखें सबसे खास। (Beautiful and attractive jewelry and clothes, along with make-up, are so enjoyable on festivals.

The festival has been criticized as being inherently [[sexism|sexist]] by some because there is no reciprocal fasting by males and called uplifting for women by others.&lt;ref name="ref72mazub"&gt;{{Citation | title=Human development in the Indian context: a socio-cultural focus | author=Margaret Khalakdina | publisher=SAGE Publications, 2008 | isbn=978-0-7619-3610-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eezZAAAAMAAJ | quote=''...

== Traditional tales ==
There are legends associated with the ''Karva Chauth'' festival. In some tellings, the tales are interlinked, with one acting as a [[frame story]] for another.

===The Story of Queen Veervati===
A beautiful queen called Veervati was the only sister of seven loving brothers. She spent her first ''Karva Chauth'' as a married woman at her parents' house. She began a strict fast after sunrise but, by evening, was desperately waiting for the moonrise as she suffered severe thirst and hunger. Her seven brothers couldn't bear to see their sister in such distress and created a mirror in a ''[[Sacred fig|pipal tree]]'' that made it look as though the moon had risen. The sister mistook it for the moon and broke her fast. The moment she took the first morsel of food, she sneezed. In her second morsel she found hair. After the third she learned the news of her husband, the king, was dead. Heartbroken, she wept through the night until her ''shakti'' compelled a Goddess to appear and ask why she crying. When the queen explained her distress, the Goddess revealed how she had been tricked by her brothers and instructed her to repeat the ''Karva Chauth'' fast with complete devotion. When Veervati repeated the fast, [[Yama]] was forced to restore her husband to life.&lt;ref name="ref94behoc"&gt;{{Citation | title=Fairs and Festivals of India |author1=S.P. Sharma |author2=Seema Gupta | publisher=Pustak Mahal, 2007 | isbn=978-81-223-0951-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54MSg3a63WgC | quote=''... The only sister of seven loving brothers, she was married to a king. On the occasion of the first Karva Chauth after her marriage, she went to her parents' house.

Harman | publisher=SUNY Press, 2007 | isbn=978-0-7914-6708-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ov2oltTLinkC | quote=''... Krishna recounting to Draupadi a story that he had heard Shiva tell Parvati. The core of the tale involves a human woman, Virvati ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a variant of this story, the brothers build a massive fire behind a mountain instead and trick their sister by convincing her that the glow is the moon. She breaks her fast and word arrives that her beloved husband has died. She immediately begins running to her husband's house, which is somewhat distant, and is intercepted by [[Shiva]]-[[Parvati]]. Parvati reveals the trickery to her, cuts her own little finger to give the wife a few drops of her holy blood, and instructs her to be careful in keeping the complete fast in the future. The wife sprinkles Parvati's blood on her dead husband and, coming back to life, they are reunited.&lt;ref name="ref15zezuv"/&gt;

===The Legend of Mahabharata===
The belief in this fast and its associated rituals goes back to the pre-Mahabharata times. [[Draupadi]], too, is said to have observed this fast. Once [[Arjuna|Arjun]] went to the [[Nilgiris]] for penance and the rest of the [[Pandavas]] faced many problems in his absence. Draupadi, out of desperation, remembered [[Lord Krishna]] and asked for help. Lord Krishna reminded her that on an earlier occasion, when Goddess [[Parvati]] had sought Lord [[Shiva|Shiva's]] guidance under similar circumstances, she had been advised to observe the fast of Karva Chauth. In some tellings of this legend, Shiva tells Parvati the story of Veervati to describe the ''Karva Chauth'' fast. Draupadi followed the instructions and observed the fast with all its rituals. Consequently, the Pandavas were able to overcome their problems.&lt;ref name="ref85peqic"/&gt;

===The Legend of Karva===
A woman named Karva was deeply devoted to her husband. Her intense love and dedication towards him gave her ''shakti'' (spiritual power). While bathing at a river, her husband was caught by a crocodile. Karva bound the crocodile with a cotton yarn and asked [[Yama]] (the god of death) to send the crocodile to hell. Yama refused. Karva threatened to curse Yama and destroy him. Yama, afraid of being cursed by ''Pati-vrat'' (devoted) wife, sent the crocodile to hell and blessed Karva's husband with long life. Karva and her husband enjoyed many years of wedded bliss. To this day, Karva Chauth is celebrated with great faith and belief.&lt;ref name="ref98vopal"&gt;{{Citation | title=Veiled gurus: a Hindu mother's experiential involvement in religious knowledge transmission | author=Colleen Yim | publisher=University Press of America, 2008 | isbn=978-0-7618-3775-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xteudBGBIuoC | quote=''... Yamraj told Karva that the crocodile still had to live few more years ... Karva told him ... she would destroy him by putting a curse on him. Yamraj got scared ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Story of Satyavan and Savitri===
When Lord Yama came to procure [[Satyavan]]'s soul, Savitri begged him to grant him life. When he refused, she stopped eating and drinking and followed Yama who carried away her dead husband. Yama said that she could ask for any other boon except for the life of her husband. Savitri asked that she be blessed with children. Yama agreed. Being a "'[[Pativrata|Pati-Vrat]]'" (devoted) wife, Savitri would never let any other man be the father of her children. Yama was left with no other choice but to restore Savitri's husband to life.&lt;ref name="ref94behoc"/&gt; This Story refers to a different punima and not Karva Chauth

The Mexican [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) has held the '''La Copa Junior''' ("The Junior Cup") tournament on an infrequent schedule since 1996. The tournament pays respect to the fact that wrestling is a family tradition in [[Lucha libre]], with a large number of second or even third generation wrestlers following the footsteps of their relatives.&lt;ref name=MondoFamily/&gt; So far CMLL has held seven tournaments starting in 1996 and then intermittently in 2005, 2006, 2010, 2012 and two tournaments in 2014. The seventh ''La Copa Junior'' tournament has been announced for January 2016. While most of the family relationships are real there are a few instances of the family relationship being a [[narrative thread|storylines]] family relationship, such as [[Dragón Rojo Jr.]] being billed as the grandson of Dragón Rojo, when in reality that is simply a storyline created by CMLL.&lt;ref name=DragonFamily/&gt; As of the 2014 VIP tournament there have been seven ''La Copa Junior'' tournaments promoted by CMLL, a total of 60 wrestlers have competed in one or more tournaments with, [[Shocker (wrestler)|Shocker]] and [[Volador Jr.]] having the record for most tournaments, five each.

The oldest tournament winner was [[Emilio Charles Jr.]], who was 39 years old when he won the [[#La Copa Junior Tournament (1996)|1996 tournament]], while the oldest competitor ever was [[Brazo de Plata]] who was 51 years old when he wrestled in the [[#La Copa Junior VIP tournament (2014)|2014 VIP]] tournament. The youngest tournament winner was [[Andrade Cien Almas|La Sombra]], who won the [[#La Copa Junior Tournament (2012)|2012 tournament]] at 23 years of age. [[Cachorro (wrestler)|Cachorro]] or Mano Negra Jr. is the youngest wrestler to compete in the tournament, both were around 16 or 17 years old when they completed in the ''La Copa Junior'' tournament, but their actual birth date is not known, just birth year, making it impossible to determine who was the youngest entrant overall.

The ''La Copa Junior'' tournament did not return until 2005 when CMLL revived the concept and presented it as an annual recurring tournament. Like the 1996 version the 2005 tournament played out over 2 editions of CMLL's ''Super Viernes'' shows, on February 22, 2005 and March 1, 2005. [[Héctor Garza]] was originally supposed to work the tournament, but was unable to return to Mexico due to commitments in the [[United States of America]] and had to be replaced by [[Apolo Dantés]]. [[Olímpico]] was unable to compete due to a neck injury, forcing CMLL to replace him with [[Antonio Gómez Medina|Máscara Mágica]] and the 1996 winner [[Emilio Charles Jr.]] had to pull out of the tournament due to a hand injury, he was replaced by [[Brazo de Oro (wrestler)|Brazo de Oro]]. The tournament came down to [[Dr. Wagner Jr.]] and [[Shocker (wrestler)|Shocker]] facing off in the finals, with Shocker winning the whole tournament.&lt;ref name=Junior2005/&gt;

CMLL brought the La Copa Junior tournament back in late 2012, holding the tournament spread out over two ''[[CMLL Super Viernes]]'' shows and the finals as the main event of the 2012 ''[[Sin Piedad (2012)|Sin Piedad]]''. The two qualifying rounds took place on the [[CMLL Super Viernes (November 2012)#November 30, 2012|November 30, 2012]] and the [[CMLL Super Viernes (December 2012)#December 7, 2012|Super Viernes December 7, 2012]]. CMLL decided to change the tournament format for the 2012 version, instead adopting their normal tournament format, with two qualifying ''[[torneo cibernetico]]'', multi-man elimination matches, with the winner of each match advancing to the finals. Each of the qualifying blocks consisted of 10 second generation wrestlers for a total of 20 competitors over all, the highest number of competitors in any of the ''La Copa Junior'' tournaments. The first qualifying block was won by [[Andrade Cien Almas|La Sombra]], lastly eliminating his longtime rival [[Volador Jr.]] to earn his spot in the finals.&lt;ref name=OfficialNov30&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmll.com/02_resultados/super_viernes/super_viernes_cmll.htm |archivedate=December 1, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CaUiwS86?url=http://www.cmll.com/02_resultados/super_viernes/super_viernes_cmll.htm |title=Viernes 30 de Noviembre |date=November 30, 2012 |accessdate=December 1, 2012 |publisher=[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second qualifying block was won by [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) representative [[Alipate Fifita|Tama Tonga]] as he eliminated [[Shocker (wrestler)|Shocker]] to earn his spot in the finals.&lt;ref name=OfficialDec7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmll.com/02_resultados/super_viernes/super_viernes_cmll.htm |archivedate=December 8, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ClAvGxdY?url=http://www.cmll.com/02_resultados/super_viernes/super_viernes_cmll.htm |title=Viernes 7 de Deciembre |date=December 7, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012 |publisher=[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final match was the only match contested under two out of three falls that saw La Sombra defeat Tama Tonga two falls to one to win the 2012 ''La Copa Junior'' tournament.&lt;ref name=CopaJr2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2012/12/15/la-copa-jr-2012-es-para-la-sombra/|title=La Copa Jr. 2012 es para... ¡La Sombra!|last=Mexicool|first=Rey|date=December 15, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2012|work=SuperLuchas|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2017 ''La Copa Junior Nuevos Valores''''' was a ''[[Lucha libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]] tournament that took place over three weeks from April 14, 2017 through April 28, 2017. To qualify for the tournament a wrestler must be a second or third generation wrestler, either legitimately or through the storyline character they portray. The format of the 2017 tournament matches the previous tournament, as well as a number of CMLL's other annual tournaments. 16 wrestlers are divided into two groups of eight that wrestle in a ''[[torneo cibernetico]]'' elimination match on April 14 and April 21, the survivor of each qualifying ''torneo cibernetico'' then faces off against each other in the finals on April 28, 2017. The 2017 version of the tournament was given the tagline ''Nuevos Valores'', emphasizing that this specific tournament would focus on the "new guys", younger wrestlers who normally wrestle on the low-to-middle part of the show, between matches 1 and 3. CMLL has previously held tournaments to focus on the younger wrestlers such as the ''Sangre Nueva'' tournament or "Forjando un Idolo", but this would be the first time CMLL specifically designated the Copa Junior as being strictly for "new guys". [[Artillero]], who competed in Block B was the only wrestler to not fit the "new" mold, as he had been working for CMLL for 17 years at that point, starting in 2005.&lt;ref name=FuegoArtillero/&gt; On April 28, 2017 [[Soberano Jr.]] defeated [[Sansón (wrestler)|Sansón]] to win the tournament.&lt;ref name=Junior2017&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmll.com/?p=1788 |title=Resultados Arena México - Viernes Espectacular |date=April 29, 2017 |accessdate=April 30, 2017 |publisher=[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] |language=Spanish |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6q6x6Hxks?url=http://cmll.com/?p=1788 |archivedate=April 30, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.f4wonline.com/mexico/cmll-arena-mexico-results-sons-tribute-his-legendary-father-234611 | title=CMLL Arena Mexico Results: A son's tributre to his legendary father | first=Chris | last=Aiken | publisher=Wrestling Observer Figure Four Online | date=April 29, 2017 | accessdate=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Le Patin Libre''' is a performance art company creating and touring performances on [[ice skates]], utilizing ice and glide as means for self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lepatinlibre.com/|title=Le Patin Libre|website=lepatinlibre.com|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 2005 by figure skater, Alexandre Hamel, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the group created what is regarded as a new genre of performing art, called '''contemporary skating'''.&lt;ref name="BrixtonBlog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brixtonblog.com/brixtons-ice-arena-hosts-the-dynamic-ice-skaters-le-patin-libre-this-weekend-2/9318 |title=Brixton’s Ice Arena hosts the dynamic ice-skaters, Le Patin Libre, this weekend |publisher=Brixton Blog |date=2013-01-11 |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeOutLondon"&gt;{{cite web|author=This is an archived page. |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/dance/contemporary-ice-skating-in-splendid-ice-olation |title=Contemporary ice skating |publisher=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized as an artistic collective, Le Patin Libre is currently composed of five dedicated members: Samory Ba, Jasmin Boivin, Taylor Dilley, Alexandre Hamel, Pascale Jodoin.

Apart from performing, the group is also politically involved in an effort to re-organize public skating sessions and improve general access to, and freedom of motion on, public ice surfaces in Montreal, QC, CA.

Early in the company's development, media described Le Patin Libre as ''"[[Disney on Ice]] with a bonus hint of imagination, artistic expression and technical mastery"''. The initial growth of the troupe was linked to winter festivals, which are a tradition in the province of [[Quebec]]. Exploring skating outside, the troupe was inspired by Montreal's contemporary dance and circus scene.&lt;ref name="Official Site Press Kit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lepatinlibre.com/en/press-kit/ |title=Press Kit &amp;#124; lepatintibre.com |publisher=Lepatinlibre.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently Le Patin Libre has been 'playing with choreography and imagery that rinses viewers of all conventional expectations.'&lt;ref name="Mackrell"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/30/le-patin-libre-vertical-influences-review-ice-dance|title=Le Patin Libre five-star review – skating dancers are a breath of fresh ice|last=Mackrell|first=Judith|date=2014-10-30|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary skating==
Contemporary skating is a genre of performance art created by Le Patin Libre. The concept was conceived by Alexandre Hamel in 2005. Since that time, the concept has evolved, and the genre has emerged, as evidenced by critics approval&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/30/le-patin-libre-vertical-influences-review-ice-dance|title=Le Patin Libre five-star review – skating dancers are a breath of fresh ice|last=Mackrell|first=Judith|date=2014-10-30|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the collectives latest material, and the interest of traditional contemporary dance organizations such as [[Sadler's Wells]], [[Dance Umbrella]] Festival&lt;ref name="Wieg"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/22/ice-skaters-le-patin-libre-vertical-influences-edinburgh-festival|title=Cool moves: meet the sequin-free ice skaters Le Patin Libre|last=Wieg|first=Chris|date=2015-08-22|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Arts Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nac-cna.ca/en/event/9792|title=Le Patin Libre {{!}} Vertical Influences {{!}} February 27 - 28, 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=nac-cna.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary skating differs from other on-ice performance activities including [[figure skating]]. The concept of contemporary skating was inspired by contemporary dance and circus. Artists in Le Patin Libre claim that; as simple as it may seem, glide is a profound way of movement particular to skating which merits exploration.&lt;ref name="Wieg"/&gt;

=== Tap-skating ===

A style of on ice movement invented by the troop, utilizing [[tap dance]] and skating.  The artists use the sounds of their blades to create music.

=== Freestyle/Extreme Ice Skating ===

Performers within Le Patin Libre have experimented with freestyle skating; a concept developed by teenagers in France to play with and explore on ice movement.

A '''magazine''' is a [[publication]], usually a [[periodical literature|periodical publication]], which is [[printing|printed]] or [[electronic publishing|electronically published]] (sometimes referred to as an [[online magazine]]). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of [[content (media)|content]]. They are generally financed by [[advertising]], by a [[newsagent's shop|purchase price]], by prepaid [[subscription business model|subscriptions]], or a combination of the three. At its root, the word "magazine" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with [[gunpowder magazine]]s, [[magazine (artillery)|artillery magazines]], [[magazine (firearms)|firearms magazines]], and, in French, retail stores such as [[department store]]s.

==Definition==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
By definition, a ''magazine'' paginates with each issue starting at page three, with the standard sizing being {{cvt|8+3/8|×|10+7/8|in}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} However, in the technical sense a ''[[Academic journal|journal]]'' has continuous pagination throughout a volume. Thus ''[[Business Week]]'', which starts each issue anew with page one, is a magazine, but the ''[[Association for Business Communication#Journal of Business Communication|Journal of Business Communication]]'', which starts each volume with the winter issue and continues the same sequence of pagination throughout the coterminous year, is a journal. Some professional or trade publications are also peer-reviewed, an example being the ''[[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants#External links|Journal of Accountancy]]''. Academic or professional publications that are not peer-reviewed are generally ''professional magazines''. That a publication calls itself a ''journal'' does not make it a journal in the technical sense; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' is actually a [[newspaper]].

==Distribution==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
[[File:Jakarta Magazines Rack.jpg|thumb|English print magazines]]
[[File:German Printmagazines.jpg|thumb|German print magazines]]
Magazines can be distributed through the [[mail]], through sales by [[Newsagent's shop|newsstands]], [[Bookselling|bookstores]], or other vendors, or through free distribution at selected pick-up locations. The [[subscription business model]]s for distribution fall into three main categories.

===Paid circulation===
In this model, the magazine is sold to readers for a price, either on a per-issue basis or by subscription, where an annual fee or monthly price is paid and issues are sent by post to readers. Paid circulation allows for defined readership statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://knowledge.auditedmedia.com/featured-content/circulation-101-us-newspaper-terms-for-paid-and-business-traveler-circulation|title=Circulation 101: U.S. Newspaper Terms for Paid and Business/Traveler Circulation|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-paid circulation===
This means that there is no cover price and issues are given away, for example in street dispensers, airline, or included with other products or publications. Because this model involves giving issues away to unspecific populations, the statistics only entail the number of issues distributed, and not who reads them.

===Controlled circulation===
This is the model used by many [[trade magazine]]s (industry-based periodicals) distributed only to qualifying readers, often for free and determined by some form of survey. Because of costs (e.g., printing and postage) associated with the medium of print, publishers may not distribute free copies to everyone who requests one (unqualified leads); instead, they operate under controlled circulation, deciding who may receive free subscriptions based on each person's qualification as a member of the trade (and likelihood of buying, for example, likelihood of having corporate purchasing authority, as determined from job title). This allows a high level of certainty that advertisements will be received by the advertiser's target audience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppa.co.uk/all-about-magazines/circulation|title=Home Page - PPA|author=|date=|website=PPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it avoids wasted printing and distribution expenses. This latter model was widely used before the rise of the [[World Wide Web]] and is still employed by some titles. For example, in the United Kingdom, a number of computer-industry magazines use this model, including ''[[Computer Weekly]]'' and ''[[Computing (magazine)|Computing]]'', and in finance, ''[[Waters Magazine]]''. For the global media industry, an example would be ''[[VideoAge International]].''

==History==
[[File:M. Browne - Herbert Railton - Sydney Grundy - Arthur Sullivan - Haddon Hall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Front cover of 1 October 1892 issue of ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'']]
The earliest example of magazines was ''[[Erbauliche Monaths Unterredungen]]'', a literary and philosophy magazine, which was launched in 1663 in Germany.&lt;ref name="mdes"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of magazines|url=http://www.magazinedesigning.com/history-of-the-magazines/|website=Magazine Designing|accessdate=10 October 2013|date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', first published in 1731, in London was the first general-interest magazine.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; [[Edward Cave]], who edited ''The Gentleman's Magazine'' under the pen name "[[Edward Cave|Sylvanus Urban]]", was the first to use the term "magazine," on the analogy of a military storehouse.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', ''s.v.'' "Magazine", and {{cite web |url=http://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/?p=5695|title=Magazine - A Dictionary of the English Language - Samuel Johnson - 1755|website=johnsonsdictionaryonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by [[Herbert Ingram]] in 1842, ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' was the first [[illustrated]] magazine.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite news|title=The History of Magazines|url=https://www.magazines.com/history-of-magazines|publisher=Magazines.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
The oldest consumer magazine still in print is ''[[The Scots Magazine]]'', which was first published in 1739, though multiple changes in ownership and gaps in publication totalling over 90 years weaken that claim. ''[[Lloyd's List]]'' was founded in Edward Lloyd's England coffee shop in 1734; and though it's on-line platform is still updated daily it has not been published as a magazine since 2013 after 274 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lloydslist.com/ll/incoming/article429827.ece|title=Lloyd’s List set to become a totally digital service on 20 December 2013|author=|date=|website=lloydslist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being among the first mass media outlets to venture from the bible, periodicals still remained rooted in the naturalized class and gender system held by European and American society.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Jared. The Rise and Fall of Early American Magazine Culture. Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 2012. 224 pp. Reviewed by Edward Cahill Fordham University. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturing of the early magazines were done via an archaic form of the printing press, using large hand-engraved wood blocks for printing.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Nineteenth Century Wood Engravers at Work: Mass Production of Illustrated Periodicals (1840-1880)|last = Martin|first = Michèle|date = March 1, 2014|journal = Journal of Historical Sociology 27, 1|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; When production of magazines increased, entire production lines were created to manufacture these wooden blocks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===France===
{{main|History of French journalism|History of journalism}}
[[File:GazettedeFrance.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|''La Gazette'', 26 December 1786]]
Under the ancien regime, the most prominent magazines were ''[[Mercure de France]]'', ''[[Journal des sçavans]]'', founded in 1665 for scientists, and ''[[La Gazette (France)|Gazette de France]]'', founded in 1631. [[Jean Loret]] was one of France's first journalists. He disseminated the weekly news of music, dance and Parisian society from 1650 until 1665 in verse, in what he called a ''gazette burlesque'', assembled in three volumes of ''La Muse historique'' (1650, 1660, 1665). The French press lagged a generation behind the British, for they catered to the needs the aristocracy, while the newer British counterparts were oriented toward the middle and working classes.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Botein, Jack R. Censer, and Harriet Ritvo, "The periodical press in eighteenth-century English and French society: a cross-cultural approach." ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 23#3 (1981): 464-490.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodicals were censored by the central government in Paris. They were not totally quiescent politically—often they criticized Church abuses and bureaucratic ineptitude. They supported the monarchy and they played at most a small role in stimulating the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Censer, ''The French press in the age of Enlightenment'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; During the Revolution, new periodicals played central roles as propaganda organs for various factions. [[Jean-Paul Marat]] (1743–1793) was the most prominent editor. His ''[[L'Ami du peuple]]'' advocated vigorously for the rights of the lower classes against the enemies of the people Marat hated; it closed when he was assassinated. After 1800 Napoleon reimposed strict censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Darnton and Daniel Roche, eds., ''Revolution in Print: the Press in France, 1775–1800'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Magazines flourished after Napoleon left in 1815. Most were based in Paris and most emphasized literature, poetry and stories. They served religious, cultural and political communities. In times of political crisis they expressed and helped shape the views of their readership and thereby were major elements in the changing political culture.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Michael Baker, et al., ''The French Revolution and the Creation of Modern Political Culture: The transformation of the political culture, 1789–1848'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there were eight Catholic periodicals in 1830 in Paris. None were officially owned or sponsored by the Church and they reflected a range of opinion among educated Catholics about current issues, such as the 1830 July Revolution that overthrew the Bourbon monarchy. Several were strong supporters of the Bourbon kings, but all eight ultimately urged support for the new government, putting their appeals in terms of preserving civil order. They often discussed the relationship between church and state. Generally, they urged priests to focus on spiritual matters and not engage in politics. Historian M. Patricia Dougherty says this process created a distance between the Church and the new monarch and enabled Catholics to develop a new understanding of church-state relationships and the source of political authority.&lt;ref&gt;M. Patricia Dougherty, "The French Catholic press and the July Revolution." ''French History'' 12#4 (1998): 403-428.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkey ===

==== General ====
The ''Moniteur Ottoman'' was a gazette written in [[French language|French]] and first published in 1831 on the order of [[Mahmud II]]. It was the first [[Government gazette|official gazette]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], edited by Alexandre Blacque at the expense of the [[Sublime Porte]]. Its name perhaps referred to the French newspaper ''[[Le Moniteur Universel]]''. It was issued weekly. ''[[Takvim-i Vekayi|Takvim-i vekayi]]'' was published a few months later, intended as a translation of the ''Moniteur'' into [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. After having been edited by former Consul for Denmark "''M. Franceschi''", and later on by "''Hassuna de Ghiez''", it was lastly edited by Lucien Rouet. However, facing the hostility of embassies, it was closed in the 1840s.

==== Satire ====
Satirical magazines of Turkey have a long tradition, with the first magazine (''Diyojen'') published in 1869. There are currently around 20 [[satirical magazine]]s; the leading ones are ''[[Penguen]]'' (70,000 weekly circulation), ''LeMan'' (50,000) and ''Uykusuz''. Historical examples include [[Oğuz Aral]]'s magazine ''[[Gırgır]]'' (which reached a circulation of 500,000 in the 1970s) and ''Marko Paşa'' (launched 1946). Others include ''L-Manyak'' and ''Lombak''.

====Late 19th century====
[[File:Harper's January.png|thumb|right|upright|''Harper's Monthly'', a literary and political force in the late 19th century]]
In the mid-1800s, monthly magazines gained popularity. They were general interest to begin, containing some news, vignettes, poems, history, political events, and social discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar, LaRose, Davenport. ''Media Now: Understanding Media, Culture, and Technology'' (Nelson Education, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike newspapers, they were more of a monthly record of current events along with entertaining stories, poems, and pictures. The first periodicals to branch out from news were [[Harper's Magazine|''Harper's'']] and ''[[The Atlantic]]'', which focused on fostering the arts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Biagi, Shirley. Media Impact: An Introduction to Mass Media, 2013 Update. Cengage Publishing, 2013. Textbook.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Harper's'' and ''The Atlantic'' persist to this day, with Harper's being a cultural magazine and The Atlantic focusing mainly on world events. Early publications of Harper's even held famous works such as early publications of [[Moby-Dick|''Moby Dick'']] or famous events such as the laying of the world's first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]]; however, the majority of early content was trickle down from British events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|website= Harper's Magazine|title = About|url = http://harpers.org/history/|accessdate =|date = 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the magazines stimulated an increase in literary criticism and political debate, moving towards more opinionated pieces from the objective newspapers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The increased time between prints and the greater amount of space to write provided a forum for public arguments by scholars and critical observers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|first = Frank Luther|last = Mott|title=A History of American Magazines, 1865–1885|date =1938|isbn = 9780674395527|publisher = Harvard University Press|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zt1V-ISXFsoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early periodical predecessors to magazines started to evolve to modern definition in the late 1800s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Works slowly became more specialized and the general discussion or cultural periodicals were forced to adapt to a consumer market which yearned for more localization of issues and events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Progressive Era: 1890s–1920s====
{{further|Muckrakers|Mass media and American politics}}
Mass circulation magazines became much more common after 1900, some with circulations in the hundreds of thousands of subscribers. Some passed the million-mark in the 1920s. It was an age of [[mass media]]. Because of the rapid expansion of national advertising, the cover price fell sharply to about 10 cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter C. Holloran et al. eds.|title=The A to Z of the Progressive Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rt3243E-Wm0C&amp;pg=PA266|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=266|isbn=9780810870697}}&lt;/ref&gt; One cause was the heavy coverage of corruption in politics, local government and big business, especially by ''Muckrakers.'' They were journalists who wrote for popular magazines to expose social and political sins and shortcomings. They relied on their own [[investigative journalism]] reporting; muckrakers often worked to expose social ills and corporate and [[Corruption in the United States|political corruption]]. Muckraking magazines–notably ''[[McClure's]]''–took on corporate monopolies and crooked [[political machine]]s while raising public awareness of chronic urban poverty, unsafe working conditions, and [[social issues]] like [[child labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Shapiro, ed., ''The muckrakers and American society'' (Heath, 1968), contains representative samples as well as academic commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalists who specialized in exposing waste, corruption, and scandal operated at the state and local level, like [[Ray Stannard Baker]], [[George Creel]], and [[Brand Whitlock]]. Other like [[Lincoln Steffens]] exposed political corruption in many large cities; [[Ida Tarbell]] went after [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s [[Standard Oil Company]]. [[Samuel Hopkins Adams]] in 1905 showed the fraud involved in many patent medicines, [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' gave a horrid portrayal of how meat was packed, and, also in 1906, [[David Graham Phillips]] unleashed a blistering indictment of the U.S. Senate. Roosevelt gave these journalists their nickname when he complained they were not being helpful by raking up all the muck.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Miraldi, ed. ''The Muckrakers: Evangelical Crusaders'' (Praeger, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry H. Stein, "American Muckrakers and Muckraking: The 50-Year Scholarship," ''Journalism Quarterly'', (1979) 56#1 pp 9–17&lt;/ref&gt;

====21st century====
In 2011, 152 magazines ceased operations and in 2012, 82 magazines.&lt;ref name="ibt"&gt;{{cite news|title=In Memoriam: Magazines We Lost In 2012|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/memoriam-magazines-we-lost-2012-956388|accessdate=9 October 2013|newspaper=IBT|date=22 December 2012|author=Christopher Zara}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the years of 2008 to 2015, Oxbridge communications announced that 227 magazines launched and 82 magazines closed in 2012 in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/248772/number-of-magazine-launches-and-closures-in-north-america/|title=Number of magazine launches and closures in North America 2015 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to MediaFinder.com, 93 new magazines launched between the first six months of 2014 and just 30 closed.

==Women's magazines==

===Fashion===
{{Main|Flapper}}
Immortalized in movies and magazines, young women's fashions of the 1920s set both a trend and social statement, a breaking-off from the rigid [[Victorian era|Victorian]] way of life. Their glamorous life style was celebrated in the feature pages and in the advertisements, where they learned the brands that best exemplified the look they sought. These young, rebellious, middle-class women, labeled "[[flapper]]s" by older generations, did away with the corset and donned slinky knee-length dresses, which exposed their legs and arms. The hairstyle of the decade was a chin-length bob, which had several popular variations. [[Cosmetics]], which, until the 1920s, were not typically accepted in American society because of their association with prostitution, became, for the first time, extremely popular.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Kitch, ''The Girl on the Magazine Cover'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2001). pp. 122–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s new magazines appealed to young German women with a sensuous image and advertisements for the appropriate clothes and accessories they would want to purchase. The glossy pages of ''Die Dame'' and ''Das Blatt der Hausfrau'' displayed the "Neue Frauen," "New Girl" - what Americans called the flapper. She was young and fashionable, financially independent, and was an eager consumer of the latest fashions. The magazines kept her up to date on fashion, arts, sports, and modern technology such as automobiles and telephones.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Sylvester, "Before Cosmopolitan: The Girl in German women's magazines in the 1920s." ''Journalism Studies'' 8#4 (2007): 550-554.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious magazines ==
Religious groups have used magazines for spreading and communicating religious doctrine for over 100 years. ''The Friend'' was founded in Philadelphia in 1827 at the time of a major Quaker schism; it has been continually published and was renamed [[Friends Journal]] when the rival Quaker groups formally reconciled in the mid-1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=https://www.friendsjournal.org/2005133/|title=Liberal Quaker Journal Publishing to 1955|work=Friends Journal|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Several Catholic magazines launched at the turn of the 20th Century that still remain in circulation including; [[St. Anthony Messenger]] founded in 1893 and published by the [[Franciscan Friars]] (O.F.M.) of St. John the Baptist Province, [[Cincinnati, Ohio]],  Los Angeles based [https://angelusnews.com/ Tidings,]  founded in 1895 (renamed [[Angelus (magazine)|Angelus]] in 2016), and published jointly by The Tidings Corporation and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles]],  and [https://maryknollmagazine.org/ Maryknoll], founded in 1907 by the [https://maryknollsociety.org/ Foreign Mission Society of America] which brings news about the organization's charitable and missionary work in over 100 countries. There are over 100 Catholic magazines published in the United States, and thousands globally which range in scope from inspirational messages to specific religious orders, faithful family life,  to global issues facing the world wide Church. The Watchtower publication was started by [[Charles Taze Russell]] on July 1879 under the title ''Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence''. ''The Watchtower—Public Edition'' is one of the [[List of magazines by circulation|most widely circulated magazine]] in the world, with an average printing of approximately 62 million copies every two months in 200 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/|title=Read the Watchtower and Awake!

[[File:Marsz dla zycia i rodziny 2007 06.jpg|thumb|right|March for Life and Family in 2007|300px]]{{Abortion in the Catholic Church}}'''March for Life and Family''' ([[Polish language|Pol. ''Marsz dla Życia i Rodziny'']] ) is an annual march for a [[natural marriage|marriage]], meaning as a partnership between a man and a woman, and for dignity of a human life from a [[Human fertilization|fertilization]] to a natural death. The first march was in [[Warsaw]], now the march is organizing in many towns in [[Poland]], but not in the same date&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsz.org/|title=Marsz dla Życia i Rodziny|access-date=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The ''Centre of Life and Family Foundation'' ([[Polish language|Pol. Fundacja Centrum Życia i Rodziny]]) is organizing the march in Warsaw and coordinating all the marches named ''March for Life and Family'' in Poland. Other marches are arranged by many [[pro-life]] organizations and Catholic institutions (e.g. ''Fundacja Pro'' – a Polish pro-life organisation, ''Piotr Skarga Society of Christian Culture'' /[[Polish language|Pol. ''Stowarzyszenie Kultury Chrześcijańskiej im. Ks. Piotra Skargi'']]/, [[Neocatechumenal Way]], [[Light-Life Movement]], [[Catholic Action]] and other).

==June 4, 2006==
The first march took place in 2006 in Warsaw. According to the Catholic Information Agency&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foto.kai.pl/?wp=display&amp;did=1060&lt;/ref&gt; it attracted over 2000 people, mainly young with their families, representants of [[conservative]] non-governmental organisations and [[right-wing]] politicians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfp.org/polands-first-national-march-for-life-and-family-draws-over-2000/|title=Poland’s First National March for Life and Family Draws Over 2000|access-date=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Demonstrators held banners with slogans: "Love is hetero", "Right to birth for everyone", "Man and woman the true family", "Stop abortion", "Stop perversion" (with a picture of two men holding their hands), "I choose life". A pop concert, funded by the government, closed the march.

==May 20, 2007==
According to [[police]] statistics the second march in 2007 attracted about 600 people. However, organisors claimed that the number of people reached 4000{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. The march was attended by right-wing politicians such as [[Roman Giertych]], [[Wojciech Wierzejski]], [[Marian Piłka]] and [[Artur Zawisza]], as well as various institutions, e.g. Fundacja Pełna Chata (Full Cottage Foundation), Grupa "Człowiek tak – homoseksualizm nie" ("Human yes – homosexuality no" Group), Bielańskie Stowarzyszenie Rodzin Wielodzietnych (Bielany Association of Families with a lot of Children).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fundacjapro.org.pl&lt;/ref&gt; The march was also attended by pro-life activists from Germany, Italy, France, [[Chile]], [[Peru]] and United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://fakty.interia.pl/fakty_dnia/news/warszawa-dzisiaj-kolejny-marsz,913018{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonstrators held banners with slogans "Marriage only between man and woman", "Perversion stop" as well as Polish national flags and crosses.

==May 25, 2008==
The third march took place in May 2008. Prior to the march there were several films presented on abortion, miraculous revelation of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Madonna]] and [[culture of death]] regarding current situation in Sweden, where [[same-sex marriage]] is to be recognised. There was also a lecture at the Catholic [[Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw]] on abortion and methods of contraception approved by the Vatican. According to the police statistics there were less than 1000 demonstrators, but organisators claim that there were about 4000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rp.pl/artykul/139022.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80708,5242630.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Initial treatment involves supporting the person's breathing and providing [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=AHA2015Part12/&gt; [[Naloxone]] is then recommended among those who are not breathing to reverse the opioids effects.&lt;ref name=AHA2015Part12&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Caen AR, Berg MD, Chameides L, Gooden CK, Hickey RW, Scott HF, Sutton RM, Tijssen JA, Topjian A, van der Jagt ÉW, Schexnayder SM, Samson RA | title = Part 12: Pediatric Advanced Life Support: 2015 American Heart Association Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care | journal = Circulation | volume = 132 | issue = 18 Suppl 2 | pages = S526-42 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26473000 | doi = 10.1161/cir.0000000000000266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Giving naloxone [[nasal administration|into the nose]] or as an [[injection into a muscle]] appears to be equally effective.&lt;ref name=Chou2017/&gt; Among those who refuse to go to hospital following reversal, the risks of a poor outcome in the short term appear to be low.&lt;ref name=Chou2017&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chou R, Korthuis PT, McCarty D, Coffin PO, Griffin JC, Davis-O'Reilly C, Grusing S, Daya M | title = Management of Suspected Opioid Overdose With Naloxone in Out-of-Hospital Settings: A Systematic Review | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 167 | issue = 12 | pages = 867–875 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29181532 | doi = 10.7326/M17-2224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to prevent deaths from overdose include improving access to naloxone and treatment for opioid dependence.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Because of their effect on the part of the brain that regulates breathing, [[Opioid]]s can lead to the person not breathing (respiratory depression) during overdoses and therefore result in death.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;  Opiate overdose symptoms and signs can be referred to as the [[Toxidromes|"opioid overdose triad"]]: decreased level of consciousness, pinpoint pupils and respiratory depression. Other symptoms include seizures and muscle spasms. Sometimes a person experiencing an opiate overdose can lead to such a decreased level of consciousness that he or she won't even wake up to their name being called or being shaken by another person.

Prolonged [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] from respiratory depression can also lead to detrimental damage to the brain and spinal cord and can leave the person unable to walk or function normally, even if treatment with naloxone is given.

Alcohol also causes respiratory depression and therefore when taken with opioids can increase the risk of [[respiratory depression]] and death.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;

In young children, opioid overdose may not be apparent right away. This is due to absorption, distribution, and metabolism differences between young children and adults, and the higher amount of opioid ingestion per kilogram of body weight.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;

==Cause==
[[File:Prescription Drug Overdoses-CDC Vital Signs-July 2012.pdf|thumb|upright=1.3|Prescription Drug Overdose Patient Information, CDC 2012]]

Risk factors for opioid overdose include [[opioid dependence]], injecting opioids, using high doses of opioids, and use together with [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[benzodiazepines]], or [[cocaine]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIDA-deaths/&gt; The risk is particularly high following [[detoxification]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; Dependence on prescription opioids can occur from their use to treat [[chronic pain]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; In young children an overdose is usually due to opioids that are intended for their parents, older siblings, or grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyer EW, McCance-Katz EF, Marcus S | title = Methadone and buprenorphine toxicity in children | journal = The American Journal on Addictions | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 89–95 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20132125 | doi = 10.1111/j.1521-0391.2009.00002.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mothers who take [[codeine]] during breastfeeding, opioid overdoses have occurred in their baby.&lt;ref name=Laz2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lazaryan M, Shasha-Zigelman C, Dagan Z, Berkovitch M | title = Codeine should not be prescribed for breastfeeding mothers or children under the age of 12 | journal = Acta Paediatrica | volume = 104 | issue = 6 | pages = 550–6 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25809057 | doi = 10.1111/apa.13012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Codeine is therefore not recommended in those who are breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=Laz2015/&gt;

=== Co-ingestion ===
Opioid overdoses are often associated with [[benzodiazepines]] or [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1007 |title=BestBets: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines in opiate overdose and the association with a poorer outcome }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1006 |title=BestBets: Concomitant use of alcohol in opiate overdose and the association with a poorer outcome }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other CNS depressants, muscle relaxers, pain relievers, anti-convulsants, [[anxiolytics]], treatment drugs of a psychoactive or epileptic variety or any other such drug with its active function meant to calm or mitigate neuronal signaling ([[barbiturate]]s, etc.) can additionally cause a worsened condition with less likelihood of recovery cumulative to each added drug. This includes drugs less immediately classed to a slowing of the metabolism such as with GABAergics like [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]] or glutamatergic antagonists like [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] or [[ketamine]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Risk factors ===

Opioids are metabolized by the liver before they are excreted in the urine and each opioid may be metabolized by different cytochrome P450 enzymes.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Polymorphisms in CYP superfamily of genes vary by individual and can account for differences in therapeutic response to drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhou SF, Liu JP, Chowbay B | title = Polymorphism of human cytochrome P450 enzymes and its clinical impact | journal = Drug Metabolism Reviews | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 89–295 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19514967 | doi = 10.1080/03602530902843483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This biotransformation of opioids by the liver can either lead to the inactivation or activation of the drug.&lt;ref name = "Ferrari_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferrari A, Coccia CP, Bertolini A, Sternieri E | title = Methadone--metabolism, pharmacokinetics and interactions | journal = Pharmacological Research | volume = 50 | issue = 6 | pages = 551–9 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15501692 | doi = 10.1016/j.phrs.2004.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, methadone is converted primarily by CYP3A4 liver enzyme to an inactive metabolite.&lt;ref name = "Ferrari_2004" /&gt; In contrast, codeine is an initially inactive prodrug that is metabolized by CYP2D6 to its active form morphine to exert its analgesic effects.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirchheiner J, Schmidt H, Tzvetkov M, Keulen JT, Lötsch J, Roots I, Brockmöller J | title = Pharmacokinetics of codeine and its metabolite morphine in ultra-rapid metabolizers due to CYP2D6 duplication | journal = The Pharmacogenomics Journal | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 257–65 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 16819548 | doi = 10.1038/sj.tpj.6500406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual who has a poor metabolizer phenotype of CYP2D6 may experience weak analgesic effects with codeine while someone who has the ultra-rapid metabolizer phenotype would experience greater side effects.&lt;ref name="Schmidt" /&gt;

==Mechanism==

[[Permanent brain damage]] may occur due to [[cerebral hypoxia]] or opioid-induced [[neurotoxicity]].&lt;ref name=NIH2017Her/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neurotoxicity review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cunha-Oliveira T, Rego AC, Oliveira CR | title = Cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the neurotoxicity of opioid and psychostimulant drugs | journal = Brain Research Reviews | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 192–208 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18440072 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.03.002 | quote = Since morphine can induce neurotoxicity (Hu et al., 2002; Mao et al., 2002; Lim et al., 2005), it may contribute to the neurotoxic effects of heroin. However, we showed that 6-MAM and morphine do not contribute to street heroin neurotoxicity in cultured cortical neurons (Cunha-Oliveira et al., 2007). In accordance, a recent study suggests that heroin has a higher neurotoxic potential in comparison with morphine (Tramullas et al., 2008). | hdl = 10316/4676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opioids inhibit the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]]'s chemoreceptors through the mu and delta receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White JM, Irvine RJ | title = Mechanisms of fatal opioid overdose | journal = Addiction | volume = 94 | issue = 7 | pages = 961–72 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10707430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opioids bind to receptors that are part of the endogenous opioid system as well as other central nervous neurotransmitter systems, binding to excitatory neurotransmitters like dopamine or glutamate, or inhibitory neurotransmitters like GABA. The main excitatory chemoreceptor, glutamate, and main inhibitory chemoreceptor, GABA, are the main neurotransmitters that control respiration.&lt;ref&gt;Watson SJ, Akil H, Khachaturian H, et al.

==Treatment==
In people who have overdosed on opioids, [[basic life support]] and [[naloxone]] are recommended as soon as possible. Naloxone is effective at reversing the cause, rather than just the symptoms, of an opioid overdose.&lt;ref name="pmid17621393"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Etherington J, Christenson J, Innes G, Grafstein E, Pennington S, Spinelli JJ, Gao M, Lahiffe B, Wanger K, Fernandes C | title = Is early discharge safe after naloxone reversal of presumed opioid overdose? | journal = Cjem | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 156–62 | date = July 2000 | pmid = 17621393 | url = http://www.cjem-online.ca/v2/n3/p156 | author10 = Fernandes, C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to adults, children often need larger doses of naloxone per kilogram of body weight.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;

Leutnant '''Otto Parschau''' (11 November 1890 &amp;ndash; 21 July 1916) was a German World War I [[Flying Ace]] and recipient of the [[Pour le Mérite]], [[Royal House Order of Hohenzollern]], and [[Iron Cross]], First Class.  He was noted as one of the pre-eminent aces on the [[Fokker Eindecker]]. He was one of the world's first flying aces, as along with ''Leutnant'' [[Kurt Wintgens]], Parschau was one of the original pilots entrusted with the prototype of the revolutionary [[Fokker Eindecker]]  fighter plane with a machine gun synchronized to fire safely through its propeller arc via use of a [[synchronization gear|gun synchronizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=''Early German Aces of World War I'' |pages= 4, 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Parschau was born in [[Klucznik|Klutznick]], in the [[Olsztyn|Allenstein]] district of [[East Prussia]].  He became a commissioned officer a year after having joined the [[Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 151]] in 1910. Parschau was trained as a pilot in [[Johannisthal Air Field|Johannisthal]], [[Darmstadt]] and in [[Hanover]] and received his licence on 4 July 1913.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title=''Early German Aces of World War I'' |page= 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
Upon the outbreak of hostilities in August 1914 Parschau was already serving with the [[Luftstreitkräfte]], and soon found himself flying two-seaters in operations on the [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] front and then in [[Flanders]] and [[Alsace-Lorraine]] before being posted to [[West Prussia]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===The ''Green Machine'' (A.16/15)===
[[Image:Otto Parschau's A-16-15 Eindecker.jpg|thumb|left|Close-up photo of Otto Parschau's "green machine", armed with a synchronized Parabellum MG14 machine gun in May 1915, essentially the Fokker Eindecker "prototype".]]
Parschau was assigned a [[Fokker Eindecker|Fokker A.III]] aircraft bearing both the Fokker factory serial number ''216'', and the IdFlieg military serial number of ''A.16/15'', previously used by one [[Oberleutnant]] [http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/showthread.php?t=49077 Waldemar von Buttlar]. This unarmed monoplane had been privately purchased in 1913 by von Buttlar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Josef |date=2012 |title=Fokker Eindecker Compendium, Volume 1 |url= |location=Berkhampstead, Hertfordshire UK |publisher=Albatros Publications, Ltd. |page=32 |isbn=978-1-906798-22-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose aircraft had been requisitioned by the [[Luftstreitkräfte|''Fliegertruppe'']] along with his commissioning as an officer in the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] at the outbreak of hostilities, and had been painted a shade of green, the colour of von Buttlar's previous [[Marburg]]-based Jäger Regiment 11.&lt;ref name="vanWyngarden pg. 9"&gt;vanWyngarden 2006, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Parschau had served&lt;ref name="vanWyngarden 2006 9"&gt;{{cite book |last=vanWyngarden |first=Greg |authorlink= |title=Osprey Aircraft of the Aces #73: Early German Aces of World War 1 |url= |year=2006 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=Botley, Oxford UK &amp; New York City, USA |isbn=978-1-84176-997-4 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the same, [[Oberste Heeresleitung|surreptitiously named ''Brieftauben-Abteilung Ostende'' unit]], abbreviated as '''BAO''' in German military communications of the time, in Belgium as ''Oberleutnant'' von Buttlar did in November 1914, where the two German officers could have first made contact.
As ''A.16/15'' still bore the green color of von Buttlar's old unit, the aircraft became distinctive as Parschau's 'Green Machine', right from the outbreak of World War I.  Parschau flew this machine on a [[roving commission]] for nearly a year,&lt;ref name="vanWyngarden 2006 9"/&gt; serving with [[Feldflieger abteilung|FFAs]] 22 and 42 and [http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/showthread.php?t=49077 the aforementioned "BAO" unit], which was actually a group of four FFA units operating as one for the ''[[Oberste Heeresleitung]]'' or OHL, the World War I German Army's High Command office. In this period, Parschau flew his distinctive machine on the [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] front during October and November 1914.  Following this were periods in [[Flanders]] and [[Alsace-Lorraine]] before Parschau was posted first to [[West Prussia]] and then on to [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. His travels were marked on the Fokker's fuselage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  This same aircraft would be the very first airframe ever to be fitted with a workable [[synchronization gear]], and was equipped with the Fokker ''Stangensteuerung'' synchronizer — along with one [[Parabellum MG14]] machine gun for its armament — in late May 1915 for Parschau's use and combat evaluation, and to function as the prototype [[Fokker Eindecker]].

[[File:Parschau's E1-15.jpg|thumb|left|Otto Parschau's Fokker M.5K/MG (Fokker factory no. "191") with IdFlieg serial E.1/15, the very first series-built [[Fokker Eindecker]] ever produced, shown with "lowered" wing mount location.]]

===Later war service===
Because Parschau was recognised as an experienced and proficient pilot, he was selected to go to [[Feldflieger abteilung|FFA]] 62 at [[Douai]] as an instructor on monoplanes.  Amongst his students at FFA 62 were the notable pioneer German flying aces, [[Max Immelmann]] and [[Oswald Boelcke]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Despite his earlier complaints of his [[Parabellum machine gun]] jamming, he managed to reel off a string of six victories over enemy airplanes between 11 October 1915&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/showthread.php?p=694696 The Aerodrome Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; and 2 July 1916 as part of the [[Fokker Scourge]]. On 3 July 1916, he shot down an enemy observation balloon. In July 1916 he transferred to FFA 32, gaining his 8th victory on 9 July 1916.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book |title=''Above the Lines: The Aces and Fighter Units of the German Air Service, Naval Air Service and Flanders Marine Corps 1914 - 1918'' |page= 138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Pour le Merite]] the following day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pourlemerite.org/ Retrieved on 26 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On the 14th, AKN was severed from FFA 32 and Parschau was appointed to its command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=''Early German Aces of World War I'' |page= 64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 1916 Parschau was mortally wounded during combat with the [[Royal Flying Corps]] over [[Grévillers]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; He was severely wounded in the chest and also suffered a glancing [[bullet wound]] to the head, possibly from rounds fired by [[John Oliver Andrews]]. He retained enough control to land his plane behind German lines, and was rushed to a field hospital but died on the operating table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=''Early German Aces of World War I'' |page= 66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''scorched-earth''' policy is a [[military strategy]] that aims to destroy anything that might be useful to the enemy while it is advancing through or withdrawing from a location. Any assets that could be used by the enemy may be targeted, for example food sources, water supplies, transportation, communications, industrial resources, and even the locale's people themselves.

The practice can be carried out by the [[military]] in enemy territory, or in its own home territory. It may overlap with, but it is not the same as, punitive destruction of the enemy's resources, which is done for purely strategic/political reasons rather than strategic/operational reasons.

Notable historic examples of scorched-earth tactics include the Russian army's strategy during the failed [[Swedish invasion of Russia]], the failed [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleonic invasion of Russia]], [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William Tecumseh Sherman's]] [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] in the [[The American Civil War|American Civil War]], colonel [[Kit Carson]]'s subjugation of the American Navajo Indians, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener's]] advance against the [[Boers]], the initial Soviet retreat commanded by [[Joseph Stalin]] during the German Army's [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Second World War]],&lt;ref&gt;John Graham Royde-Smith, Encyclopedia Britannica online. Operation Barbarossa. https://www.britannica.com/event/Operation-Barbarossa . Accessed Aug 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] retreat on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].

The strategy of destroying the food and water supply of the civilian population in an area of conflict has been banned under Article 54 of [[Protocol I]] of the 1977 [[Geneva Conventions]]. The relevant passage says:

{{quote|It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove, or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse Party, whatever the motive, whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, or for any other motive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deoxy.org/wc/wc-proto.htm |title=Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Convention, 1977 |publisher=Deoxy.org |date=1954-05-14 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept of ''scorched earth'' is sometimes applied figuratively to the business world, where a firm facing a takeover attempt will make itself a lesser prize by selling off its assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Willcox |first1=Tilton |date=January 1988 |title= The Use and Abuse of Executive Powers in Warding off Corporate Raiders|journal=Journal of Business Ethics |volume=7 |issue=1/2 |pages= 51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient times==
The [[Scythians]] used scorched-earth methods against King [[Darius the Great]] of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], during [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|his European Scythian campaign]]. The Scythians, who were nomadic herders, evaded the Persians and retreated into the depths of the Steppes, destroying food supplies and poisoning wells. Many of Darius' troops died from starvation and dehydration.

The Greek general [[Xenophon]] records in his ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' that the [[Armenians]] burned their crops and food supplies as they withdrew before the advance of the [[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]].

The Greek mercenary general [[Memnon of Rhodes|Memnon]] suggested to the Persian [[Satraps]] the use of the scorched-earth policy against Alexander as he moved into Asia Minor. He was refused.

==Roman era==
The system of punitive destruction of property and subjugation of people when accompanying a military campaign was known as ''vastatio''. Two of the first uses of scorched earth recorded both happened in the [[Gallic Wars]]. The first was used when the [[Celt]]ic [[Helvetii]] were forced to evacuate their homes in Southern Germany and Switzerland due to incursions of unfriendly Germanic tribes: to add incentive to the march, the Helvetii destroyed everything they could not bring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard A. |last=Billows |title=Julius Caesar: The Colossus of Rome |ISBN=9781134318322}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Helvetii were defeated by a combined Roman-Gallic force, the Helvetii were forced to rebuild themselves on the shattered German{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and Swiss plains they themselves had destroyed.

The second case shows actual military value: during the [[Battle of Alesia|Great Gallic War]] the [[Gauls]] under [[Vercingetorix]] planned to lure the Roman armies into Gaul and then trap and obliterate them. To this end, they ravaged the countryside of what are now the [[Benelux]] countries and France. This did cause immense problems for the Romans, but Roman military triumphs over the Gallic alliance showed that this alone was not enough to save Gaul from subjugation by Rome.

During the [[Second Punic War]] in 218–202 BC, the Carthaginians used this method selectively while storming through [[Ancient Rome|Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Dexter |last=Hoyos |title=A Companion to the Punic Wars |ISBN=9781444393705}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the [[Third Punic War]] in 146 BC, the Roman Senate also elected to use this method to permanently destroy the Carthaginian capital city, [[Carthage]] (near modern-day [[Tunis]]). The buildings were torn down, their stones scattered so not even rubble remained, and the fields were burned. However, the story that they [[salt the earth|salted the earth]] is [[apocryphal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ridley |first=R. T. |title=To Be Taken with a Pinch of Salt: The Destruction of Carthage |journal=[[Classical Philology (journal)|Classical Philology]] |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=140–146 |year=1986 |jstor=269786 |doi=10.1086/366973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year AD 363, the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]]'s invasion of [[Sassanid Persia]] was turned back by a scorched-earth policy:

{{quote|The extensive region that lies between the River Tigris and the mountains of Media...was in a very improved state of cultivation. Julian might expect, that a conqueror, who possessed the two forcible instruments of persuasion, steel and gold, would easily procure a plentiful subsistence from the fears or avarice of the natives. But, on the approach of the Romans, the rich and smiling prospect was instantly blasted. Wherever they moved...the cattle was driven away; the grass and ripe corn were consumed with fire; and, as soon as the flames had subsided which interrupted the march of Julian, he beheld the melancholy face of a smoking and naked desert. This desperate but effectual method of defence can only be executed by the enthusiasm of a people who prefer their independence to their property; or by the rigor of an arbitrary government, which consults the public safety without submitting to their inclinations the liberty of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward |last=Gibbon |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=f8-2ONV-foQC |page=158 }} |title=The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |year=1788 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Middle Ages==

===Early Middle Ages===
British monk [[Gildas]], whose sixth-century treatise "On the Ruin of Britain"  wrote about an earlier invasion "For the fire of vengeance … spread from sea to sea … and did not cease, until, destroying the neighbouring towns and lands, it reached the other side of the island."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/11/gold-hoard/alexander-text |title=Magical Mystery Treasure |publisher=nationalgeographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First Fitna|First Islamic Civil War]] (656-661), [[Muawiyah I]] sent Busr ibn Abi Artat to a campaign in the [[Hejaz]] and [[Yemen]] to ravage territory loyal to Muawiyah's opponent [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. According to [[Al-Tabari|Tabari]], 30,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed during this campaign. Muawiyah also sent Sufyan ibn Awf to [[Iraq]] to burn the crops and homes of Ali's supporters.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=15TZsW4gTY0C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=busr+ibn+abi+artat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9YUDJGYD0g&amp;sig=cBwElmaPL2MsXfIAO-SJ3LvNWuM&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiM583DjLfeAhVBOhoKHe1kBSQQ6AEwBHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=busr%20ibn%20abi%20artat&amp;f=true&lt;/ref&gt;

During the great Viking invasion of England opposed by [[Alfred the Great]] and various other Saxon and Welsh rulers, the Viking chieftain [[Hastein]] in late summer 893 marched his men to [[Chester]] to occupy the ruined Roman fortress there. The refortified fortress should have made an excellent base for raiding northern [[Mercia]], but the Mercians are recorded as having taken the drastic measure of destroying all crops and livestock in the surrounding countryside in order to starve the Danes out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dot-domesday.me.uk/wessex_three.htm |title=871 – 899  Alfred (‘the Great’) |publisher=dot-domesday.me.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danes left Chester next year and marched into Wales.

===Harrying of the North===
In the [[Harrying of the North]], [[William the Conqueror]]'s solution to stop a rebellion in 1069 was the brutal conquest and subjugation of the North of England. William's men burnt whole villages from the [[Humber]] to [[Tees]], and slaughtered the inhabitants. Food stores and livestock were destroyed so that anyone surviving the initial massacre would soon succumb to starvation over the winter. The destruction is depicted in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyinanhour.com/2010/06/17/the-harrying-of-the-north-a-great-medieval-massacre-1069/ |title=A Great Medieval Massacre, 1069 |publisher=historyinanhour.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survivors were reduced to [[cannibalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Forester, Thomas, ed., [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=gpR0iz5GjYgC }} ''The Chronicle of Florence of Worcester''], London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854, Pg 174&lt;/ref&gt; with one report stating that the [[Human skull|skulls]] of the dead were cracked open so that the brains could be eaten. Between 100,000 and 150,000 perished and the area took centuries to recover from the damage.

===High and Late Middle Ages===
[[File:Robertthebruce.jpg|thumb|[[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]]]]

During the [[Hundred Years' War]], both the English and the French conducted [[chevauchée]] raids over the enemy territory to damage its infrastructure.

[[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] counselled using these operational methods to hold off the English [[Edward I of England|King Edward's]] forces when the English invaded Scotland, according to an anonymous 14th-century poem:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Steel Bonnets'' by George MacDonald Fraser.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;in strait places gar keep all store,
And byrnen ye plainland them before,
That they shall pass away in haist
What that they find na thing but waist.
...This is the counsel and intent
Of gud King Robert's testiment.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In 1336, the defenders of [[Pilėnai]] in [[Lithuania]] set their castle on fire and committed mass suicide in order to make the attacking [[Teutonic Order]]'s [[Pyrrhic victory|victory a costly one]].

The strategy was widely used in the Romanian principalities of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]]. Prince [[Mircea I of Wallachia]] used it against the Ottomans in 1395 and Prince [[Stephen III of Moldavia]] scorched the earth in his country as the Ottoman army advanced in 1475 and 1476.

[[File:Corfe Castke 57.JPG|thumb|[[Corfe Castle]] was slighted during the [[English Civil War]] so that its defences could not be reused.]]
A [[slighting]] is the deliberate destruction, partial or complete, of a [[fortification]] without opposition. Sometimes, such as during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] and the [[English Civil War]], the intention was to render the structure unusable as a fortress.{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=498}}{{sfn|Lowry|2006|p=29}}{{sfn|Perry|Blackburn|2000|p=321}} In England, during the Middle Ages [[adulterine castle|adulterine (unauthorised) castles]] if captured by the king would usually be slighted.{{sfn|Muir|1997|p=173}} During the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], Robert the Bruce adopted a strategy of slighting Scottish castles to prevent them being occupied by the invading English.{{sfn|Perry|Blackburn|2000|p=321}}&lt;ref&gt;Traquar, Peter ''Freedom's Sword'' p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; A strategy of slighting castles in Palestine was also adopted by the [[Mameluke]]s in their wars with the Crusaders.

==Early Modern era==
Further British use of scorched-earth policies in a war was seen during the 16th century in [[Ireland]], where it was used by English commanders such as [[Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex|Walter Devereux]] and [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Richard Bingham]].

The [[Desmond Rebellions]] are a famous case in Ireland. Much of the province of [[Munster]] was laid waste. The poet [[Edmund Spenser]] left an account of it:

{{quote|In those late wars in Munster; for notwithstanding that the same was a most rich and plentiful country, full of corn and cattle, that you would have thought they could have been able to stand long, yet ere one year and a half they were brought to such wretchedness, as that any stony heart would have rued the same. Out of every corner of the wood and glens they came creeping forth upon their hands, for their legs could not bear them; they looked Anatomies [of] death, they spoke like ghosts, crying out of their graves; they did eat of the carrions, happy where they could find them, yea, and one another soon after, in so much as the very carcasses they spared not to scrape out of their graves; and if they found a plot of water-cresses or shamrocks, there they flocked as to a feast for the time, yet not able long to continue therewithal; that in a short space there were none almost left, and a most populous and plentiful country suddenly left void of man or beast.}}

In 1630, [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field-Marshal General]] [[Torquato Conti]] was in command of [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] forces during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Forced to retreat from the advancing Swedish army of King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], Conti ordered his troops to burn houses, destroy villages and generally cause as much harm to property and people as possible. His actions were remembered thus:&lt;ref name="Schiller"&gt;''The history of the Thirty Years' War in Germany'' by Friedrich Schiller (translated by Christoph Martin Wieland, printed for W. Miller, 1799)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To revenge himself upon the Duke of Pomerania, the imperial general permitted his troops, upon his retreat, to exercise every barbarity on the unfortunate inhabitants of Pomerania, who had already suffered but too severely from his avarice. On pretence of cutting off the resources of the Swedes, the whole country was laid waste and plundered; and often, when the Imperialists were unable any longer to maintain a place, it was laid in ashes, in order to leave the enemy nothing but ruins.}}

During the [[Great Northern War]], [[Peter the Great]]'s Russian forces used scorched-earth tactics to hold back Swedish King [[Charles XII]]'s campaign towards Moscow.

===Wallachian-Ottoman Wars===
[[File:AtaculdeNoapte.jpg|thumb|The forces of [[Vlad the Impaler]] were associated with torches, particularly outside [[Târgovişte]].]]

In 1462, a massive Ottoman army led by [[Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]] marched into Wallachia. [[Vlad the Impaler]] retreated to [[Transylvania]]. During his departure, he conducted scorched-earth tactics to ward off Sultan Mehmed II's approach. When the Ottoman forces approached [[Tirgoviste]], they encountered over 20,000 people [[impalement|impaled]] by the forces of Vlad the Impaler, creating a "forest" of dead or dying bodies on stakes. This atrocious, gut-wrenching sight caused Sultan Mehmed II to withdraw from battle and instead send Radu, Vlad's brother, to fight Vlad the Impaler.

===Great Siege of Malta===
In early 1565, Grandmaster [[Jean Parisot de Valette]] ordered the harvesting of all the crops in Malta, including unripened grain, to deprive the Ottomans of any local food supplies since spies had warned of an imminent Ottoman attack. Furthermore, the Knights poisoned all wells with bitter herbs and dead animals. The Ottomans arrived on 18 May of that year, and the [[Great Siege of Malta]] began. The Ottomans managed to capture one fort but were eventually defeated by the Knights, the Maltese militia and a Spanish relief force.

===Nine Years' War===
In 1688, France attacked the German [[Palatinate]]. The German states responded to this by forming an alliance and assembling a sizeable armed force to push the French out of Germany. The French had not prepared for such an eventuality. Realising that the war in Germany was not going to end quickly and that the Rhineland ''blitz'' would not be a brief and decisive parade of French glory, [[Louis XIV]] and his War Minister [[Marquis de Louvois]] resolved upon a scorched-earth policy in the Palatinate, [[Baden]] and [[Württemberg]], intent on denying enemy troops local resources and prevent them from invading French territory.&lt;ref name="childs17"&gt;Childs (1991), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; By 20 December 1688 Louvois had selected all the cities, towns, villages and châteaux intended for destruction. On 2 March 1689 [[René de Froulay de Tessé|Count of Tessé]] torched Heidelberg; on 8 March [[Joseph de Montclar|Montclar]] levelled Mannheim. Oppenheim and Worms were finally destroyed on 31 May, followed by Speyer on 1 June, and Bingen on 4 June. In all, French troops burnt over 20 substantial towns as well as numerous villages.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mughal-Maratha Wars===
[[Shivaji Maharaj]] had introduced scorched-earth tactics known as ''Ganimi Kava''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=jpXijlqeRpIC |page=14 }} |title=India's Historic Battles: From Alexander the Great to Kargil - Kaushik Roy |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;—his forces looted traders and businessmen from Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb's empire, and burnt down his cities. But they were strictly ordered not to rape or hurt the innocent civilians, and not to cause any sort of disrespect to any of the religious institutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=N5mIVt_Zd-0C |page=351 }} |title=Shivaji the Great |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shivaji's son, [[Sambhaji Maharaj]], was detested throughout the [[Mughal Empire]] for his scorched-earth tactics until he and his men were captured by [[Muqarrab Khan]] and his [[Mughal Army]] contingent of 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=d1wUgKKzawoC |page=49 }} |title=Advanced Study in the History of Modern India 1707-1813 - Jaswant Lal Mehta |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 11 March 1689, a panel of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Qadi]]s indicted and sentenced Sambhaji to death for condoning casual [[torture]], [[arson]], looting, and massacre of the emperor's subjects, but most prominently for giving shelter to Sultan Muhammad Akbar, the fourth son of Aurangzeb, who sought Sambhajiraje's aid in winning the Mughal throne from his emperor father.  Sambhaji was particularly condemned for the three days of ravaging committed after the Battle of Burhanpur.&lt;ref name="The Mughal Empire "&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=HHyVh29gy4QC }} |title=The Mughal Empire |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1747, the Marathas, led by [[Raghoji I Bhonsle]], began to raid, pillage and annex the territories in [[Odisha]] belonging to the [[Mughal Empire]]'s [[Nawab of Bengal]], [[Alivardi Khan]].  The Maratha cavalry numbering 40,000 had sacked the town of Midnapore and set granaries and villages ablaze.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Nineteenth century==

===Napoleonic Wars===

During the 1810 (third) Napoleonic invasion of Portugal, the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] population retreated towards Lisbon, ordered to destroy all the food supplies the French might capture, forage and shelter in a wide belt across the country. (Although effective food-preserving techniques had recently been invented, they were still not fit for military use because a suitably rugged container had not yet been invented.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Otto |last=Von Pivka |title=The King's German Legion |ISBN=9781472801692}}&lt;/ref&gt; The command was obeyed as a result of French plundering and general ill-treatment of civilians in the previous invasions, the poor, angered people would rather destroy anything that had to be left behind rather than leaving it to the French.

After the [[Battle of Bussaco|Bussaco]], Massená's army marched on to [[Coimbra]] where much of the [[University of Coimbra|city's old university]] and library were vandalised, houses and furniture were destroyed and the few civilians that did not seek refuge further south were murdered. While there were instances of similar behavior by British soldiers, considering that Portugal was their ally, such crimes were generally investigated, and those found punished. Coimbra's sack made the populace even more determined in leaving nothing and when the French armies reached the [[Lines of Torres Vedras]] on the way to [[Lisbon]], French soldiers reported that the country "seemed to empty ahead of them".  When Massená reached the city of [[Viseu]], wanting to replenish his armies' dwindling food supplies, none of the inhabitants remained, and all there was to eat were grapes and lemons that, if eaten in large quantities, would be better laxatives than sources of calories. Low morale, hunger, disease, and indiscipline rendered the French Army of Portugal into a much weaker force and compelled their retreat next spring. This method was later recommended to Russia when Napoleon made his move.

[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|right|[[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon's]] retreat from Moscow]]
In 1812 Czar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] was able to render [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Russia]] useless by utilizing a scorched-earth retreat method, similar to that made by the Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2013|reason = Chandler's "Campaigns of Napoleon" (the source) makes no explicit reference to a scorched-earth policy.  Which is not to say that it did happen on a local scale.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Russian forces withdrew from the advancing French army, they burned the countryside ([[Fire of Moscow (1812)|and, allegedly, Moscow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Campaigns of Napoleon.|last = Chandler|first = David|year = 1966|page = 813}}&lt;/ref&gt;) over which they passed, leaving nothing of value for the pursuing French army. Encountering only desolate and useless land [[Napoleon]]'s [[Grand Army]] was prevented from using its accustomed doctrine of living off the lands it conquered. Pushing relentlessly on despite dwindling numbers, the Grand Army met with disaster as the invasion progressed. Napoleon's army arrived in a virtually abandoned Moscow, which was a tattered starving shell of its former self that was largely due to the use of scorched-earth tactics by retreating Russians. Having essentially conquered nothing, Napoleon's troops retreated, and again the scorched-earth policy came into effect because even though some large supply dumps had been established on the advance, the route between these had both been scorched and marched over once already, so the French Army starved as it marched along the resource-depleted invasion route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/1812/Russia/c_bridges.html |title=Rivers and the Destruction of Napoleon’s Grand Army |publisher=napoleon-series.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South American War of Independence===
In August 1812, [[Argentina|Argentine]] General [[Manuel Belgrano]] led the [[Jujuy Exodus]], a massive forced displacement of people from the present-day [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]] and [[Salta Province|Salta]] provinces to the south. The Jujuy Exodus was conducted by the patriot forces of the [[Army of the North]] that were battling a [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Royalist]] army.

Belgrano, faced with the prospect of total defeat and territorial loss, ordered all people to pack their necessities, including food and furniture, and follow him, in carriages or on foot, together with whatever cattle and beasts of burden could endure the journey. The rest (houses, crops, food stocks, and also any objects made of iron) was to be burned, so as to deprive the loyalists of resources, following a strict scorched-earth policy. On 29 July 1812, Belgrano asked the people of Jujuy to "show their [[hero]]ism" and join the march of the army under his command "if, as you assure, you want to be free". The punishment for ignoring the order was execution and the destruction of the defector's properties. Belgrano labored to win the support of the populace and later reported that most of the people had willingly followed him without the need of force.

The exodus started on 23 August and gathered people from [[San Salvador de Jujuy|Jujuy]] and [[Salta Province|Salta]]; people travelled south about 250&amp;nbsp;km, finally arriving at the banks of the Pasaje River, in the province of [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]], on the early hours of 29 August. The Patriots applied a scorched-earth policy so the Spaniards advanced into a wasteland. Belgrano’s army destroyed everything that could provide shelter or be useful to the Royalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://balagan.info/battle-of-tucuman-24-25-september-1812 |title=Battle of Tucuman 24 – 25 September 1812 |publisher=balagan.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek War of Independence===
In 1827, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] led an Ottoman-Egyptian combined force in a campaign to crash Greek revolutionaries in the [[Peloponnese]]. In response to Greek guerrilla attacks on his forces in the Peloponnese, Ibrahim launched a scorched earth campaign which threatened the population with starvation and deported many civilians into slavery in Egypt. He also allegedly planned to bring in Arab settlers, in order to replace the Greek population. The fires of burning villages and fields were clearly visible from Allied ships standing offshore. A British landing party reported that the population of Messinia was close to mass starvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Report to Codrington from Capt Hamilton ([[HMS Cambrian (1797)|HMS Cambrian]])'', reproduced in James (1837) VI.476&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim's scorched-earth policy caused much outrage in [[Europe]], being one of the reasons the [[Great Powers]] ([[Great Britain]], [[France]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]) decisively intervened against him in the [[Battle of Navarino]].

===Philippine-American War===
[[Philippine–American War|U.S. attacks into the Philippine countryside]] often included scorched-earth campaigns where entire villages were burned and destroyed, torture (''[[water cure (torture)|water cure]]'') and the concentration of civilians into "protected zones". Many of the civilian casualties resulted from disease and famine.&lt;ref name=reCasualties&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1683&amp;dat=20040208&amp;id=gbIaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GEUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5222,6070988 | author=Guillermo, Emil | title= A first taste of empire| journal= Milwaukee Journal Sentinel | date= February 8, 2004| volume= | issue= | pages= 03J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John M. |last=Gates |url=http://www3.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-ch3.html |title=War-Related Deaths in the Philippines, 1898–1902 |journal=Pacific Historical Review |volume=53 |issue=3 |year=1984 |pages=367–378 |jstor=3639234 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629045949/http://www3.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-ch3.html |archivedate=2014-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hunt for the Guerrilla General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] American troops also poisoned water wells to try to force out the Filipino rebels.&lt;ref&gt;The President and the Assassin, Scott Miller&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Civil War===
[[File:Sherman railroad destroy noborder crop.jpg|thumb|[[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman's]] troops destroy a railroad near [[Atlanta]]]]

In the [[American Civil War]], Union forces under Sheridan and Sherman used the policy widely.&lt;ref&gt;Ulysses S. Grant, [[s:Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant/Chapter XXV|Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant, Chapter XXV]]: "supplies within the reach of Confederate armies I regarded as much contraband as arms or ordnance stores. Their destruction was accomplished without bloodshed and tended to the same result as the destruction of armies. I continued this policy to the close of the war. Promiscuous pillaging, however, was discouraged and punished. Instructions were always given to take provisions and forage under the direction of commissioned officers who should give receipts to owners, if at home, and turn the property over to officers of the quartermaster or commissary departments to be issued as if furnished from our Northern depots. But much was destroyed without receipts to owners, when it could not be brought within our lines and would otherwise have gone to the support of secession and rebellion. This policy I believe exercised a material influence in hastening the end."&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]] utilized this policy during his [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]. 
Sherman's tactics were an attempt to destroy the enemy's will and logistics through burning or destroying crops or other resources that might be used for the Confederate force. The next century of "later generations of American war leaders would use in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan."&lt;ref&gt;•	https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/scorched-earth&lt;/ref&gt; During Sherman's campaign, his "men piled all deed books in front of the courthouse and burned them.  The logic was that the big plantations would not be able to prove land ownership.  These actions are the bane of Georgia and South Carolina genealogists.”&lt;ref&gt;•	http://sciway3.net/clark/civilwar/march.html&lt;/ref&gt; Another instance in his campaign was when in "for thirty-six days that army moved through Georgia, with very little opposition, pillaging the countryside. It was a sort of military promenade, requiring very little military skill in the performance, and as little personal prowess, as well trained union troops were deployed against defenseless citizens."&lt;ref&gt;•	http://www.sonofthesouth.net/leefoundation/shermans-march-to-the-sea.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another event, in response to [[William Quantrill|Quantrill's]] [[Lawrence massacre|raid on Lawrence, Kansas]], and the many civilian casualties including killing 180 men, Brigadier General [[Thomas Ewing Jr.]], Sherman's brother-in-law, issued U.S. Army [[General Order No. 11 (1863)]] to order the near-total evacuation of three and a half counties in western [[Missouri]], south of Kansas City, which were subsequently looted and burned by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pringle  |first1=Heather  |date=April 2010 |title= DIGGING THE SCORCHED EARTH |journal=Archaeology |volume= 63|issue=2 |pages=20–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Sherman's overall direction, [[Philip Sheridan|General Sheridan]] followed this policy in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of Virginia and subsequently in the Indian Wars of the Great Plains.

When [[General Grant]]'s forces broke through [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]'s defenses, [[Jefferson Davis]] ordered the destruction of Richmond's militarily significant supplies; the resulting conflagration destroyed many – mainly commercial – buildings and some Southern warships docked on the James River. Civilians in panic were forced to escape the fires started by the Confederates.

===Native American wars===
[[File:Navajo on Long Walk.gif|thumb|[[Navajo people|Navajo]] on the "[[Long Walk of the Navajo|long walk]]"]]

During the wars with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes of the [[Western United States|American West]], under [[James Henry Carleton|James Carleton's]] direction, [[Kit Carson]] instituted a scorched-earth policy, burning [[Navajo people|Navajo]] fields and homes, and stealing or killing their livestock. He was aided by other Indian tribes with long-standing enmity toward the Navajos, chiefly the [[Ute Tribe|Ute]]s. The Navajo were forced to surrender due to the destruction of their livestock and food supplies. In the spring of 1864, 8,000 Navajo men, women and children were forced to march 300 miles to [[Fort Sumner]], New Mexico. Navajos call this "[[Long Walk of the Navajo|The Long Walk]]." Many died along the way or during the next four years of their internment.

A military expedition led by [[U.S. Army]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Ranald S. Mackenzie]] was sent to the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma Territory Panhandle area in 1874 to remove the Indians to reservations in [[Oklahoma]]. The Mackenzie expedition captured about 1,200 of the Indians' horses, drove them into Tule Canyon, and shot them all. Denied their main source of livelihood and demoralized, the Comanche and Kiowa abandoned the area (see [[Palo Duro Canyon]]).

===Boer War===
[[File:VerskroeideAarde1 crop.jpg|thumb|[[Boer]] civilians watching [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] soldiers blow up their house with dynamite: Boers were given 10 minutes to gather belongings]]

[[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] applied scorched-earth policy during the latter part of the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902).  The [[Boers]], refusing to accept military defeat, adopted the first modern form of what we know today as guerrilla warfare, despite the capture of their two capital cities. As a result, the British ordered destruction of the farms and the homes of civilians in order to prevent the still-fighting [[Boers]] from obtaining food and supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Draining the Sea by Filling the Graves: Investigating the Effectiveness of Indiscriminate Violence as a Counterinsurgency Strategy|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13698240701699631|journal = Civil Wars|date = 2007-12-01|issn = 1369-8249|pages = 420–444|volume = 9|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/13698240701699631|first = ALEXANDER B.|last = DOWNES}}&lt;/ref&gt; An eloquent description of this comes from an Army officer at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Lisle March |year=1901 |title=With Rimington in the Boer War |location=London |publisher=Edward Arnold }}&lt;/ref&gt; This destruction left women and children without means to survive since crops and livestock were also destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/womens-struggle/anglo-war.htm |title=SAHO: The Anglo-Boer War |accessdate=2015-03-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821192712/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/womens-struggle/anglo-war.htm |archivedate=August 21, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of the concentration camps was exposed by [[Emily Hobhouse]], who toured the camps and began petitioning the British government to change its policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hobhouse |first=E. |year=1901 |title=Report of a visit to the camps of women and children in the Cape and Orange River Colonies |location=London |publisher=Friars Printing Association Ltd. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hobhouse |first=E. |year=1907 |title=The Brunt of War and Where it Fell |publisher=Portrayer Publishers |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to counter Hobhouse's activism, the British commissioned the Fawcett Commission, that confirmed Hobhouse's findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fawcett |first=M. H. |year=1901 |title=The Concentration Camps in South Africa |location=London |publisher=Westminster Gazette }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British later perceived the [[concentration camp]]s as a humanitarian measure, to care for displaced persons until the war was ended, in response to the Hobhouse and Fawcett reports. Negligence by the British, lack of planning and supplies and overcrowding led to much loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/ptb/wvw/War2/Pretorius%20paper.pdf |title=The Boer women and children |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade after the war P.L.A. Goldman officially determined that an astonishing number of 27,927 Boers died in the concentration camps: 26,251 women and children (of whom more than 22,000 were under the age of 16), and 1,676 men over the age of 16, of whom 1,421 were aged persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/SOUTH-AFRICA/1999-01/0917021014 |title=RootsWeb: SOUTH-AFRICA-L Re: Boer War Records |publisher=Archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date=1999-01-22 |accessdate=2011-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222100233/http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/SOUTH-AFRICA/1999-01/0917021014 |archivedate=2008-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
In 1868, [[Tūhoe]] sheltered the [[Māori people|Māori]] leader [[Te Kooti]], and for this were subjected to a scorched-earth policy, in which their crops and buildings were destroyed and their people of fighting age were captured.

==Twentieth century==

===World War I===

{{Expand section|date=December 2010}}
In [[World War I]], [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] army forces created a zone of destruction by using a large-scale scorched-earth strategy during their retreat from the German army in the summer/autumn of 1915. The Russian troops, retreating along a front of more than 600 miles, destroyed anything that might be of use to their enemy, including crops, houses, railways and entire cities. They also forcibly removed huge numbers of people. In pushing the Russians back to their homeland, the German army gained a large area of territory from the Russian Empire (in an area that is today [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hochschild|first=Adam|title=To End All Wars - a story of loyalty and rebellion 1914-1918|year=2011|publisher=Mariner Books, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|location=Boston New York|isbn=978-0-547-75031-6|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 February 1917, the German army made a strategic scorched-earth withdrawal from the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] battlefield to the prepared fortifications of the [[Hindenburg Line]], thereby shortening the front line they had to occupy. Since a scorched-earth campaign requires that there be a war of movement, World War I provided little opportunity in general for this policy as it was a stalemated war fought mostly in the same concentrated area for its entire duration.

===Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)===
{{main|Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)#Greek scorched earth policy}}

During the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)]], the retreating Greek army carried out a scorched-earth policy while fleeing from Anatolia during the final phase of the war.{{Sfn | Fisher | 1969 | p = 386}}  Historian of the Middle East, [[Sydney Nettleton Fisher]] wrote that: "The Greek army in retreat pursued a burned-earth policy and committed every known outrage against defenceless Turkish villagers in its path."{{Sfn | Fisher | 1969 | p = 386}}  [[Norman Naimark|Norman M. Naimark]] noted that "the Greek retreat was even more devastating for the local population than the occupation".{{Sfn | Naimark | 2002 | p = [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=L-QLXnX16kAC |page=46 }} 46]}}

===Second Sino-Japanese War===
During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] had a scorched-earth policy, known as "[[Three Alls Policy]]". Due to the Japanese scorched-earth policy, immense environmental and infrastructure damage have been recorded. Additionally, it contributed to the complete destruction of entire villages and partial destruction of entire cities like [[Bombing of Chongqing|Chongqing]] or [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing]].

The Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] destroyed dams and levees in an attempt to flood the land to slow down the advancement of Japanese soldiers, further adding to the environmental impact. This policy resulted in the [[1938 Huang He flood]].

===World War II===
[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-087-3693-07A,_Russland,_brennende_Ortschaft.jpg|thumb|[[Nazi Germany]]'s scorched-earth policy in the Soviet Union, 1943. Photograph taken by a [[Propagandakompanie|Wehrmacht propaganda company]]; original 1943 caption reads: "Russia. Burning houses / huts in village".]]

When [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941]], many district governments took the initiative to begin a 'partial' scorched-earth policy in order to deny the invaders access to electrical, telecommunications, rail, and industrial resources. Parts of the telegraph network were destroyed, some rail and road bridges were blown up, most electrical generators were sabotaged through the removal of key components, and many mineshafts were collapsed. {{citation needed|reason=If Stalin ordered this there should be a clear source for his order as they are public by now|date=October 2015}} The process was repeated later in the war by the German forces of [[Army Group North]] and [[Erich von Manstein]]'s [[Army Group Don]], which stole crops, destroyed farms, and razed settlements of at least city size and smaller during several military operations. The rationale for this policy was that it would slow pursuing Soviet forces by forcing them to save their own civilians, though in [[Verlorene Siege|Manstein's postwar memoirs]] at the very least the policy was justified as a means of preventing the Soviets from stealing the food and shelter from their own civilians. The best-known victims of the German scorched-earth policy were the people of the historic city of [[Novgorod]], whose hometown was razed during the Winter of 1944 to cover Army Group North's retreat from [[Leningrad]].

Near the end of the Summer of 1944, [[Finland]], which had made a separate peace with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], was required to evict the German forces, which had been fighting against the Soviets alongside Finnish troops in the Northern part of the country. The Finnish forces, under the leadership of general [[Hjalmar Siilasvuo]], struck aggressively in August 1944 by making a landfall at [[Tornio]]. This accelerated the German retreat, and by November 1944 the Germans had left most of northern Finland. The German forces, forced to retreat due to an overall strategic situation, covered their retreat towards [[Norway]] by devastating large areas of northern Finland using scorched-earth strategy. More than one-third of the dwellings in the area were destroyed, and the provincial capital [[Battle of Rovaniemi|Rovaniemi]] was burned to the ground. All but two bridges in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland Province]] were blown up and all roads were mined.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lapland War]]&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Norway which was at the same time invaded by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces in pursuit of the retreating German army in 1944, the Germans also undertook a scorched-earth policy, destroying every building that could offer shelter and thus interposing a belt of "scorched earth" between themselves and the allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Derry |first=T. K. |title=A History of Modern Norway: 1814–1972 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1972 |isbn=0-19-822503-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered his minister of armaments [[Albert Speer]] to carry out a nationwide scorched-earth policy, in what became known as the [[Nero Decree]]. Speer, who was looking to the future, actively resisted the order, just as he had earlier refused Hitler's command to destroy French industry when the Wehrmacht was being driven out of France and he managed to continue doing so even after Hitler became aware of his actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ian Kershaw |last=Kershaw |first=Ian |title=Hitler: 1936–1945: Nemesis |location=New York |publisher=Norton |year=2000 |page=785 |isbn=0-393-04994-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War the [[railroad plough]] was used in [[Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and other countries, denying the enemy's use of railroads by partially destroying them while retreating.

===Malayan Emergency===
Britain was the first nation to employ [[herbicides]] and [[defoliants]] (chiefly [[Agent Orange]]) to destroy the crops and bushes of communist insurgents in [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] during the [[Malayan Emergency]] in the 1950s. The intent was to prevent the insurgents from using them as a cover to ambush passing convoys of British troops and to destroy the peasants' ability to support them.

===Goa War===
In response to [[India|India's]] invasion on the 451 year old [[Portuguese India|Portuguese Colony of]] [[Goa]] in December 1961 during the [[Annexation of Portuguese India]], orders delivered from the [[President of Portugal|Portuguese President]] called for a scorched-earth policy — that Goa was to be destroyed before it was given up to the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.goacom.com/culture/history/church.html |title=The Church in Goa |publisher=Goacom.com |date= |accessdate=9 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402200720/http://www.goacom.com/culture/history/church.html |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite his orders from [[Lisbon]], Governor General [[Manuel António Vassalo e Silva]] took stock of the numerical superiority of the Indian troops, as well as the food and ammunition supplies available to his forces and took the decision to surrender. He later described his orders to destroy Goa as "''um sacrifício inútil''" (a useless sacrifice).

===Vietnam Conflict===
The U.S. employed [[Agent Orange]], as a part of its [[herbicidal warfare]] program, [[Operation Ranch Hand]], to destroy crops and foliage in order to expose possible enemy hideouts during the [[Vietnam War]]. [[Agent Blue]] was used on rice fields to deny food to the [[Vietcong]].

===Gulf War===
{{see also | Kuwaiti oil fires}}
During the [[Gulf War]] in 1990 when Iraqi forces were driven out of [[Kuwait]], they set more than 600 Kuwaiti oil wells on fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.american.edu/TED/kuwait.htm "The Economic and Environmental Impact of the Gulf War on Kuwait and the Persian Gulf,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219043510/http://www1.american.edu/ted/kuwait.htm |date=2010-12-19 }} ''[[Inventory of Conflict and Environment|Inventory of Conflict and Environment Cases]]'', published by [[American University]], Washington (DC), U.S.&lt;/ref&gt; This was done as part of a scorched-earth policy while retreating from Kuwait in 1991 after invading the country but being driven out by [[Coalition of Gulf War|Coalition]] military forces (''see [[Gulf War]]''). The fires were started between January to February 1991 and the last one was extinguished by November 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthshots.usgs.gov/Iraq/Iraqtext|title="Iraq and Kuwait: 1972, 1990, 1991, 1997."

===Central America===
[[Efraín Ríos Montt]] utilized this method in the [[Guatemala]]n highlands in 1981-1982, though scorched-earth tactics were first used under the previous president [[Fernando Romeo Lucas García|Romeo Lucas García]]. Upon entering office, [[Efraín Ríos Montt|Ríos Montt]] implemented a new counterinsurgency strategy that called for the use of scorched earth to combat the [[Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity|Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca]] rebellion, known as [[Plan Victoria 82]] or, more commonly, by the nickname of the rural pacification elements of this strategy - Fusiles y Frijoles (Bullets and Beans).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Guatemalan military project: a violence called democracy|last = Schirmer|first = Jennifer|publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ríos Montt's policies resulted in the death of thousands (most of them indigenous [[Maya peoples|Mayans]]).

===Southeast Asia===
The [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Indonesian military]] used this method when the [[Great Britain|British]] forces in [[Bandung]] during [[Indonesian National Revolution]] gave an ultimatum for the Indonesian combatants to leave the city. In response, the southern part of Bandung was deliberately burned down in an act of defiance as the combatants left the city on 24 March 1946. This event is known as the [[Bandung Sea of Fire]] or "Bandung Lautan Api".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sitaresmi, Ratnayu  |title=Social History of The ''Bandung Lautan Api'' (Bandung Sea of Fire), 24 March 1946  |url=http://www.bandungheritage.org/images/stories/dokumen/bandung_sea_of_fire.pdf

The [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Indonesian military]] and [[pro-Indonesia militia]]s also used this method in their [[1999 East Timorese crisis|Timor-Leste Scorched Earth]] campaign around the time of [[East Timor]]'s referendum for independence in 1999.

The '''Siege of Maarat''', or '''Ma'arra''', occurred in late 1098 in the city of [[Ma'arrat al-Numan]], in what is modern-day [[Syria]], during the [[First Crusade]]. It is infamous for the claims of widespread [[cannibalism]] displayed by the Crusaders.

==Prologue==
After the [[Crusade]]rs, led by [[Raymond IV of Toulouse|Raymond de Saint Gilles]] and [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]], successfully [[Siege of Antioch|besieged Antioch]], they started to raid the surrounding countryside during the winter months. The Crusaders had been ineffective in assessing and protecting their supply lines, which led to widespread hunger and lack of proper equipment within the Crusader armies.

In July 1098, [[Raymond Pilet d’Alès|Raymond Pilet]], a knight in the army of Raymond de Saint Gilles, led an expedition against Maarat, an important city on the road south towards [[Damascus]]. His troops met a much larger Muslim garrison in the town and they were completely routed with many casualties. For the rest of the summer the crusaders continued their march south and captured many other small towns, and arrived again at Maarat in November.

==Siege==
Around the end of November, thousands of crusaders started to besiege the city. The citizens were at first unconcerned, since Raymond Pilet's expedition had been such a failure, and they taunted the crusaders. The crusaders could also not afford to conduct a lengthy siege, as winter was approaching and they had few supplies, but they were also unable to break through the city's defenses, consisting of a deep ditch and strong walls.

The defenders of the city, mostly an urban militia and inexperienced citizens, managed to hold off the attacks for about two weeks. The crusaders spent this time building a [[siege tower]], which allowed them to pour over the walls of the city, while at the same time a group of knights scaled the undefended walls on the other side of the city.

The crusaders occupied the walls on December 11. The Muslims retreated into the city, and both sides prepared to rest for the night, but the poorer crusaders rushed through and plundered Maarat. On the morning of December 12, the garrison negotiated with [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]], who promised them safe conduct if they surrendered. The Muslims surrendered, but the crusaders immediately began to [[massacre]] the population. Meanwhile, Bohemond seized control of the walls and towers while Raymond of Toulouse took control of the interior of the city, continuing their dispute over who would rule conquered territories.

==Cannibalism==
Maarat was not as rich as the crusaders had hoped and they were still short of supplies and food as December progressed. Most of the soldiers and knights preferred to continue the march to Jerusalem, caring little for the political dispute between Bohemond and Raymond, and Raymond tried to buy the support of the other leaders. While the leaders negotiated away from the city, some of the starving crusaders at Maarat reportedly resorted to cannibalism, feeding on the dead bodies of Muslims.

A chronicler, Radulph of Caen in his contemporaneous account, ''[[Gesta Tancredi]]'' wrote, "Some people said that, constrained by the lack of food, they boiled pagan adults in cooking-pots, impaled children on spits and devoured them grilled." These events were also chronicled by [[Fulcher of Chartres]], who wrote:
{{quote|I shudder to tell that many of our people, harassed by the madness of excessive hunger, cut pieces from the buttocks of the [[Saracens]] already dead there, which they cooked, but when it was not yet roasted enough by the fire, they devoured it with savage mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Peters, The First Crusade: The Chronicle of Fulcher of Chartres and Other Source Materials (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1998), 84.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The events described by Radulph of Caen have been disputed. The famine and cannibalism are recognised as described by Fulcher of Chartres, but the torture and the killing of Muslim captives for cannibalism by Radulph of Caen are very unlikely since no Arab or Muslim records of the events exist. Had they occurred, they would have probably been recorded. That has been noted by BBC Timewatch series, the episode ''The Crusades: A Timewatch Guide'', which included experts Dr Thomas Asbridge and Muslim Arabic historian Dr Fozia Bora, who state that Radulph of Caen's description does not appear in any contemporary Muslim chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dy7mgy/a-timewatch-guide--series-1---2-the-crusades-a-timewatch-guide | title = A Timewatch Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://www.tvguide.co.uk/detail/2292268/114827766/the-crusades-a-timewatch-guide | title = The Crusades: A Timewatch Guide }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The First Crusade: A New History | first = Thomas | last = Asbridge | isbn = 978-0743220842 | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== March to Jerusalem ==
&lt;!--- probably needs to be somewhere but why under cannabilism?--- --&gt;
The crusaders also began destroying Maarat's fortifications, forcing Raymond to finally agree to continue the march south.

==Legacy==
[[Albert of Aix]] remarked that "the Christians did not shrink from eating not only killed Turks or Saracens, but even creeping dogs..." ("Nam Christiani non solum Turcos vel Sarracenos occisos, verum etiam canes arreptos (...)")&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert of Aix|Albert of Aachen]], ''Historia Hierosolimitana: History of the Journey to Jerusalem'', trans. Susan B. Edgington, Clarendon Press, 2007, ch. V.29, pg. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sitting and Smiling''' is an [[endurance art]] performance by Benjamin Bennett. In a typical performance, Bennett looks into a video camera which is recording him while sitting and smiling motionless for four hours.

Bennett uploaded his first "Sitting and Smiling" video on July 28, 2014. Over the next years he uploaded similar videos at a rate of about one per week. Currently, his videos have earned more than 15.1 million views with over 196 thousand subscribers. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqW54i24PGw1q7IxciRmgTA/about&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Putney 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Putney|first1=Dean|title=Internet man sits and smiles at camera for hundreds of hours|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/10/07/internet-man-sits-and-smiles-a.html|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=Boing Boing|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bennett cites [[Claire Bishop]]'s 2012 ''Artificial Hells: Participatory Art and the Politics of Spectatorship'' as an inspiration for his art.&lt;ref name="Suzdaltsev 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Suzdaltsev|first1=Jules|title=This Guy Is Filming Himself Sitting and Smiling for Four Hours a Day|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/meet-the-man-whos-filming-himself-sitting-and-smiling-for-four-hours-a-day-121|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=Vice|date=22 January 2015|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents on stream ==
During the fifth installment of his stream, a burglar broke into his house. He kicked down the door into Bennett's house. The thief entered the room he was streaming in and said "Hello?", and quickly left. The incident generated attention online and the video currently has over 5 million views.&lt;ref name="Sumitra 2015"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sumitra|title=This Guy Is Filming Himself Just Sitting and Smiling for Four Hours a Day |url=http://www.odditycentral.com/news/for-some-reason-this-guy-is-filming-himself-just-sitting-and-smiling-for-four-hours-a-day.html|website=Oddity Central|accessdate=17 February 2017|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tmrXakd_r6I|title=Sitting and Smiling #5|publisher=Benjamin Bennett|website=''[[YouTube]]''|time=2:36:30|date=25 November 2014|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate incident in his 52nd livestream, Benjamin clearly urinates himself, with a wet puddle seeping out from under him and gradually evaporating over the remainder of the footage. He never acknowledges this or breaks his composure and continues to sit and smile to the camera.

'''Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism''' is the conviction of the [[Sri Lankan Tamil people]], a minority ethnic group in the South Asian [[island country]] of [[Sri Lanka]] (formerly known as Ceylon), that they have the right to constitute an independent or autonomous political community. This idea has not always existed. Sri Lankan Tamil national awareness began during the era of [[British Ceylon|British rule]] during the nineteenth century, as Tamil [[Hindu]] revivalists tried to counter [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionary activity. The revivalists, led by [[Arumuga Navalar]], used literacy as a tool to spread Hinduism and its principles.&lt;ref name="jane"&gt;{{cite book| last = Russell | first =J. | title = Communal politics under the Donoughmore Constitution | publisher =Tissara Publishers | year =1982 | location =Colombo | pages = Ch. iv | doi = | id = | isbn =1-85118-002-8  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reformed legislative council, introduced in 1921 by the British, was based on principles of communal representation, which led the Tamils to realize that they were the minority ethnic group and that they should be represented by a member of their own community. It was under this communal representation that Tamil national awareness changed to national consciousness—a less passive state. They formed a Tamil political party called the [[All Ceylon Tamil Congress]] (ACTC). In the years leading to Sri Lankan independence, political tension began to develop between the majority [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] and minority Tamil communities as the ACTC, citing the possibility of the majority Sinhalese adopting a dominant posture, pushed for “fifty-fifty” representation in parliament. This policy would allot half the seats in parliament to the Sinhalese majority and half to the minority communities: [[Ceylon Tamils]], [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Indian Tamils]], [[Sri Lankan Moors|Muslims]] and others.

After Sri Lanka achieved independence in 1948, the ACTC decided to merge with the ruling [[United National Party]] (UNP). This move was not supported by half of the ACTC members and resulted in a split&amp;mdash;one half of the party decided to merge with the UNP and the other half decided to leave the party altogether, forming a new Tamil party in 1949, the [[Federal Party (Sri Lanka)|Federal party]]. Policies adopted by successive Sinhalese governments, and the 1956 success of the Sinhala Nationalist government under [[Solomon Bandaranaike]], made the Federal Party the main voice of Tamil politics.&lt;ref name="ajw1"&gt;{{cite book| last = Wilson | first =A.J. | title = S.J.V.

This was followed by the emergence of a militant, [[Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups|armed form of Tamil nationalism]].&lt;ref name=rob&gt;{{cite journal| last =Roberts | first =Michael| title =Essay | journal =Journal of South Asian Studies | volume =27 | issue =1 | pages =67–108 | publisher = | location = | year = 2004| url =http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a713631227?words=michael | doi =10.1080/1479027042000186441  | id = | accessdate =2008-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Before Independence ==

=== Early beginning ===
{{See also|Politics of Sri Lanka}}[[File:Sri Lanka Native Tamil.svg|thumb|right|Percentage of Sri Lankan Tamils per district based on 2001 or 1981 (''italicised'') census]]
The arrival of [[Protestant]] missionaries on a large scale to Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon), beginning in 1814, was a primary contributor to the development of political awareness among Tamils.&lt;ref name=g108/&gt; The activities of missionaries from the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], [[Methodists]] and [[Anglican]] churches led to a revival among Tamils of the Hindu faith. Arumuga Navalar led a Hindu religious revivalist and reformist movement as a defensive response to the threat to their native culture posed by the British colonial and missionary activities.&lt;ref name=g108/&gt; He translated literary works  to encourage the use of the Tamil Language and spread Hindu [[Saiva]] principles. Navalar’s efforts to revive Hinduism, the predominant religion of the Sri Lankan Tamil people, influenced Tamils who built their own schools, temples, and societies, and who published literature to counter that of the missionaries. Thus, by 1925 nearly 50 schools, including the [[Batticotta Seminary]], were fully functioning.&lt;!-- cannot find this reference&lt;ref name=vellu&gt; C. D. Vellupillai, "History of the American Ceylon Mission", Jaffna 1932, Ch. 1 &lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = J.| last =   Russell | title = Communal Politics under the Donoughmore Commission, 1831–1947 | version =  Ph.D. Thesis | publisher = Tissara Publishers| year =  1982 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revival movement also set the stage for modern Tamil prose.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite book| last = Russell | first =J. | title = Communal politics under the Donoughmore Constitution | publisher =Tissara Publishers | year =1982 | location =Colombo | pages = 22, 315| doi = | id = | isbn =1-85118-002-8  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of this effort led the Tamils to think confidently of themselves as a community and prepared the way for their awareness of a common cultural, religious and linguisitic kinship in the mid-nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=g108&gt;{{cite book | last = Gunasingam | first = Murugar | authorlink = | title = Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism: A study of its origins | publisher = MV Publications | year = 1999 | location = |pages=108, 201 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-646-38106-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vaitheespara2006&gt;{{cite journal

For these contributions to the Tamil people,  Arumugam Navalar has been described as a leader who gave his community a distinct identity.&lt;ref name=wilson1&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilson | first = A.J. | authorlink = | title = Sri Lankan Tamil Nationalism: Its Origins and Development in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries | publisher = University of British Columbia Press | year = 2000 | location = | pages =1–12, 27–39, 66–81, 82-111, 124 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7748-0760-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communal Consciousness ===
[[Great Britain]] controlled the whole island by 1815, and unified the country administratively in 1833 with a legislative council that acted as advisor to the Governor. The council was composed of three Europeans and one representative each of the [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]], the Sri Lankan Tamils, and the [[Burgher people|Burghers]].&lt;ref name=Stokke2000&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this situation changed in 1919 with the arrival of British Governor William Manning, who actively encouraged the idea of "communal representation". He created the reformed legislative council in 1921 and its first election returned thirteen Sinhalese and three Tamils, a significant loss in representation for the Tamils when compared to the previous council based on direct appointment by the governor.&lt;ref name="kms"&gt;{{cite book | last = De Silva | first = K.M.De Silva | authorlink = | title = A History of Sri Lanka | publisher = Penguin | year = 2005 | location = |page=448 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-55394-121-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Ceylon National Congress in Disarray, 1920–1921|journal=Ceylon Journal of Historical and Social Studies|year=1972|first=K.M.|last=De Silva|volume= 2|issue=1|page=114|id= |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the Tamils began to develop a communal consciousness and to think of themselves as a minority community. They focused on communal representation in the council rather than national representation, and decided that their delegates should be leaders from their own community.&lt;ref name="kms"/&gt;  This new sense of community identity changed the direction of Tamil nationalism. Starting in the mid-1920s,  their developing national awareness transformed into a more active national consciousness, with a heightened determination to protect the interests of the Ceylon Tamil community.&lt;ref name=wilson1/&gt; Influenced heavily by political history and, perhaps more importantly, [[Colombo]]-centered developments of the British administration, this emerging Tamil national consciousness led to the establishment of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress headed by Tamil politician, [[G. G. Ponnambalam]].&lt;ref name=wilson1/&gt;&lt;ref name=gunasingham&gt;{{cite book|author = Gunasingham, M. | year = 1999 | title = Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism: A study of its origins | publisher = MV Publications | pages =6, 76 | isbn = 0-646-38106-7|oclc = 44777400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Historic changes occurred in 1931: the reformed legislative council was eliminated, and the [[Donoughmore Commission]], which rejected communal representation, was formed. Instead, the Commission introduced [[Universal suffrage|universal franchise]], in which representation was proportionate to percentage of population. The Tamil leadership strongly opposed this plan, realizing that they would be reduced to a minority in parliament. Many Sinhalese  were also against the idea of universal franchise for all [[Caste system in Sri Lanka|caste]]s.{{Citation needed|reason=not known that Sinhalese opposed this based on caste|date=April 2012}} G.G. Ponnambalam publicly protested the Donooughmore Commission and proposed to the [[Soulbury Commission]], which had replaced the Donooughmore Commission,  that roughly equal numbers of congressional seats be assigned to Tamils and to Sinhalese in the new independent Ceylon being planned, but his proposal was rejected. From the introduction of the advisory council, through the Donoughmore Commission in 1931, to the Soulbury Commission in 1947, the primary dispute between the elite of the Sinhalese and Tamils was over the question of representation, not the structure of the government. This issue of power-sharing was used by the nationalists of both communities to create an escalating inter-ethnic rivalry which has been gaining momentum ever since.&lt;ref name=gunasingham/&gt;

Ponnambalam's advocacy of Tamil nationalism  was paralleled by a similar Sinhala nationalism of [[Sinhala Maha Sabha]],  led by future Prime Minister Solomon Bandaranaike. This created tension between the two leaders and caused the exchange of verbal attacks, with Ponnampalam calling himself a "proud [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hansard]], 1935, Col. 3045&lt;/ref&gt; This interethnic and political stress led to the first Sinhala-Tamil riot in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Full report in the "Hindu organ", June 12 (1939)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The [[Second World War]] served as an interregnum where the adroit politics of  [[D. S. Senanayake]] successfully balanced the polarising tendencies of the Sinhala and the Tamil nationalists. Senanayake, together with [[Arunachalam Mahadeva]], advocated the "Ceylonese" concept, which was similar in spirit to the [[Ceylon National Congress]]. Senanayake formed the [[United National Party]] and the first government to include both Ponnambalam's  programs and  Bandaranaike's [[Sinhala Maha Sabha]].(uncited)--&gt;(see ''[[Riots and pogroms in Sri Lanka]]'')

== After Independence ==

=== All Ceylon Tamil Congress ===
[[File:Bandera All Ceylon Tamil Congress.svg|thumb|All Ceylon Tamil Congress's flag]]The All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC), founded by G. G. Ponnambalam in 1944, was popular among Tamils because it promoted the preservation of Tamil identity.&lt;ref name=wilson1 /&gt; The ACTC advocated a "fifty-fifty" policy, in which fifty percent of the seats in parliament would be reserved for Tamils and other minorities, the remaining fifty percent going to the Sinhalese. Which means 50% of the opportunities [education (university seats), employment, etc.) should be allocated to minorities. According to the ACTC this was a necessary defensive measure to prevent unwarranted dominance by the Sinhalese. In 1947, Ponnambalam warned the Soulbury Commission about this potential problem, and presented the ACTC's solution, which he called a "balanced representation". This fifty-fifty policy was opposed by a Muslim minority and sections of the Tamil community.&lt;ref name=gunasingham/&gt; [[D. S. Senanayake]], the leader of the Sinhalese political groups, allowed Ponnambalam full control over presentations before the Soulbury Commission, prevented Sinhalese nationalists such as Solomon Bandaranaike from taking the stage, and avoided the eruption of acrimonious arguments.&lt;ref name=russell/&gt; But the Soulbury commission rejected the charges of discrimination against the Tamils, and also rejected the fifty-fifty formula as subverting democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Soulbury Commission , London (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the ACTC  decided to adopt a new policy: "responsive cooperation" with "progressive-minded Sinhalese".&lt;ref name=wilson1 /&gt; Yet in 1948, Ponnampalam decided to merge the ACTC with the ruling [[United National Party]] (UNP), although he had stated earlier that the UNP was not progressive-minded. The merge was not supported by the entire party, and it ended up splitting the ACTC in half, with one faction merging with D.S. Senanayake’s UNP and the other, led by [[S.J.V. Chelvanayakam]], deciding to leave the party altogether and advocated for equal rights, 100% opportunities for Tamils without any racial barrier. In 1948, Ponnampalam voted in favour of one of several bills, later known as the [[Ceylon Citizenship Act]] which disenfranchised Indian Tamils ("[[Hill Country Tamils]]").&lt;ref name=wilson1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=De1997/&gt; Although he did not vote for the other bills in the Ceylon Citizenship Act, because of his silence in parliament the Tamil public believed that he was not committed to Indian Tamil rights.&lt;ref name=wilson1 /&gt; The ACTC remained the major Tamil political party until 1956, when the Federal Party took over that position.&lt;ref name=Kearney1985&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tamil Congress still held parliamentary positions, however, and continued to be a force in Tamil politics. In 1976, the ACTC merged with other Tamil political factions to form a new party called the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). According to A.J. Wilson, it was the legacy of  Ponnampalam  that the consciousness of the Tamil people was raised, and they were inspired to see themselves as  a separate Tamil national identity rather as merged in an all-island polity.&lt;ref name=wilson1 /&gt;{{rp|80–81}}

=== Federal Party ===
In 1949, a new Tamil party, called the Federal Party ("Ilankai Thamil Arasu Kadchi"), was organized by the people who broke away from the ACTC. Led by [[S. J. V. Chelvanayakam|Chelvanayakam]], it gained popularity among the Tamil people because it advocated Tamil rights. Its popularity was also due to the party's opposition to the Ceylon Citizenship Act and the [[Sinhala Only Act]].&lt;ref name=De1997&gt;{{cite journal

Despite this, the Federal Party never asked for a separate Tamil state or even for self-determination.&lt;ref name=Kearney1985/&gt; Instead they lobbied for a unified state which gave Tamil and Sinhalese equal status as the official language and provided for considerable autonomy in the Tamil areas.&lt;ref name=wilson1 /&gt;{{rp|82–90}}&lt;ref name=Kearney1985/&gt;
It was against this backdrop that the [[Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact]] was signed in July 1957, but pressure from the opposition and extremist groups forced Bandaranaike to abolish the pact. After the assassination of Bandaranaike, another pact was signed in 1965 between Chelvanayakam and Dudley Senenayake called the [[Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact]], but this agreement, like the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam pact, was never implemented.&lt;ref name=wilson1 /&gt;{{rp|81–110}} The UNP was defeated in the 1970 election and replaced by the [[United Front (Sri Lanka)|United Front (UF)]], led by [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]], the widow of Solomon Bandaranaike.

The new government adopted two new policies that discriminated against the Tamil people.&lt;ref name=wilson1/&gt; First, the government introduced a double standard for admission grades to universities, requiring the Tamil students to achieve higher grades than the Sinhalese students.&lt;ref name=Stokke2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=De1984&gt;{{cite journal

Shortly after, in 1973, the Federal Party decided to demand a separate, autonomous Tamil state. Until 1973, Chelvanayakam and the Federal Party had always campaigned for a unified country and thought that any partitioning would be “suicidal”. The new policies, however, were considered to be discriminatory by the Tamil leadership,&lt;ref name=cstudy&gt;{{cite web|title= Tamil Alienation |author=Russell R. Ross|author2=Andrea Matles Savada |url= http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/71.htm|publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=2008-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this modified the official position on Tamil Nationalism. To further the new political agenda, in 1975 the Federal Party merged with the other Tamil political parties to become the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF).&lt;ref name=wilson1 /&gt;{{rp|82–111}} In 1976, after the first national convention of TULF, the Ceylon Tamils moved toward a revised nationalism and were now unwilling to live within a confined, single-island entity.&lt;ref name=wilson1 /&gt;{{rp|101–110}}

===Tamil United Liberation Front===
The Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) was formed when the Tamil political parties merged and adopted the [[Vaddukoddai Resolution]], named after the village, [[Vaddukoddai]], where it was developed. In the 1977 election, TULF became the first Tamil Nationalist party to run on a separatist platform. It gained a majority of the votes in the north and east, won 18 seats, and became the largest opposition party in parliament.&lt;ref name=Hin&gt;{{cite web|title= TULF leader passes away |author=DBS Jeyaraj|url= http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/06/06/stories/2002060603761100.htm|publisher=Hindu News |accessdate=2008-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vaddukoddai Resolution had a profound effect on Tamil politics—the parliamentary system was soon to be replaced by guns. TULF tried to refashion itself as the political division, negotiating an agreement with the executive president of Sri Lanka at that time, [[Junius Richard Jayewardene|J.R. Jayewardene]]. This agreement, known as the District Development Councils’ Scheme, was passed in 1980, but TULF rejected it because J.R. Jayewardene had not agreed to let TULF have the five District Ministerships in the five Tamil districts where TULF received the most votes.&lt;ref name=wilson2&gt;{{cite book | author = Wilson, A.J. | year = 1988 | title = The Break-up of Sri Lanka: The Sinhalese-Tamil Conflict | publisher = C.

Publishers|pages= 142–143, 228|isbn =0-7748-0760-1 | oclc = 21523218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sixth Amendment was passed in 1983, requiring Tamils in parliament and other public offices to take an oath of allegiance to the unified state of Sri Lanka. It forbade the advocating of a separate state, and consequently TULF members were expelled from parliament for refusing to take the oath.&lt;ref name=wilson2 /&gt;

=== Militant groups ===
{{Main article|Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups|List of Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups}}
[[File:Tamil Tiger women at war.jpg|thumb|right|Tamil women rebels in formation in [[Killinochchi]], 2004]]After the expulsion of TULF from parliament, militants ruled the Tamil political movement. As a result, the 1970s saw the emergence of more than 30 Tamil militant groups. [[Anton Balasingham]], the theoretician of the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE), states that the causes of the militarization of the Tamil youth were unemployment, lack of opportunities for higher education, and the imposition of an alien language. He further alleges that the majority Sinhalese government was responsible for these problems, adding that the only alternative left for Tamil youths was a "revolutionary armed struggle for the independence of their nation".&lt;ref name=wilson1 /&gt;{{rp|124}}&lt;ref name=Balasingham1983&gt;{{cite journal

Of these five dominant groups, the LTTE was the most solidly nationalistic Tamil resistance organization. Furthermore, because of its policies, constructive Tamil Nationalist platform, and desire for national self-determination, the LTTE was supported by major sections of the Tamil community.&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilson, A.J.|year=2000|title=Sri Lankan Tamil Nationalism:Its Origins and Development in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|publisher=C.

'''Stephen Randall Glass''' (born September 15, 1972)&lt;ref&gt;U.S. birth records&lt;/ref&gt; is a former journalist and is currently employed at a law firm in [[Beverly Hills]].  In 1998, it was revealed that many of his published articles were fabrications. Over a three-year period as a young rising star at ''[[The New Republic]]'', Glass invented quotations, sources, and events in articles he wrote for that magazine and others. Most of Glass's articles were of the entertaining and humorous type. Some were based entirely on fictional events. Several seemed to endorse negative stereotypes about ethnic and political groups. In 2016, Glass revealed that he had repaid over $200,000 to ''The New Republic'' and other publications for his earlier fabrications.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2016/03/discredited-journalist-stephen-glass-reveals-200000-repayments-to-4-magazines&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass holds a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Georgetown University Law Center]]. Although he passed the [[bar exam]] in both New York and California, he withdrew his application to become a licensed attorney in New York in 2004 after being advised it would not succeed. In 2014, the [[California Supreme Court]] unanimously ruled that he should not be licensed in that state.&lt;ref name="In Re Glass" /&gt; Glass worked as a paralegal at a law firm for a number of years and was later promoted to Director of Special Projects and Trial Team Coordinator.&lt;ref name="czrlaw.com"&gt;http://www.czrlaw.com/special-ops-trial-team/stephen-glass/&lt;/ref&gt;

His career at ''The New Republic'' was dramatized in the 2003 film ''[[Shattered Glass (film)|Shattered Glass]]'' in which Glass was portrayed by [[Hayden Christensen]]. Glass fictionalized his own story in ''The Fabulist'', a 2003 novel whose protagonist is named "Stephen Aaron Glass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Glass|year=2003|title=The Fabulist|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|ISBN=0-7432-2712-3|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Glass grew up in a Jewish family in the northern Chicago suburb of [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]].&lt;ref name=Bissinger&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink= H. G. Bissinger| first= H. G. | last= Bissinger |url= http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/archive/1998/09/bissinger199809 |title=Shattered Glass|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last= Pfefferman |first=Naomi |authorlink= |title=Journalistic Fake-Out Before Blair |publisher=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|Jewish Journal]]|date=October 30, 2003 |url=http://jewishjournal.com/culture/arts/8613/  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] as University Scholar, where he was an executive editor of the [[student newspaper]], ''[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]]''.&lt;ref name="czrlaw.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name= Erdeley&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erdeley|first1=Sabrina|title=Reflections on a Shattered Glass|url=http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0104/0104arts02.html|website=Pennsylvania Gazette|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His colleagues at the Daily Pennsylvanian included [[Sabrina Erdely]] who later became involved in a fabricated story scandal too owing to her Rolling Stone article "[[A Rape on Campus]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/1198/hughes2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After his 1994 graduation from Penn, Glass joined ''[[The New Republic]]'' in 1995 as an editorial assistant.&lt;ref name=60Min&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[CBS News]]| url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/07/60minutes/main552819.shtml |title=Stephen Glass: I lied for self-esteem| first= Rebecca| last= Leung|work= [[60 Minutes]]| date= August 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, the 23-year-old Glass advanced to writing features. While employed full-time at ''TNR'', he also wrote for other magazines including ''[[Policy Review]]'', ''[[George (magazine)|George]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'', and ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' and contributed to [[Public Radio International]]'s (PRI) weekly hour-long program ''[[This American Life]]'', hosted by [[Ira Glass]] (no relation to Stephen).

Glass later graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Georgetown University Law Center]] with a [[Juris Doctor]] degree and was named John M. Olin Fellow in law and economics.&lt;ref name="czrlaw.com"/&gt;

==''The New Republic''==
Although Glass enjoyed loyalty from ''The New Republic'' staff, his reporting repeatedly drew outraged rebuttals from the subjects of his articles, eroding his credibility and leading to private skepticism from insiders at the magazine. The magazine's majority owner and editor-in-chief, [[Martin Peretz]], later said that his wife had told him that she did not find Glass's stories credible and had stopped reading them.&lt;ref name=skinner&gt;{{cite news|author=[[David Skinner (journalist)|David Skinner]]|work=[[Weekly Standard]]|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/330txifj.asp |title=Picking Up the Pieces|date=October 31, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1996, the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] (CSPI) was the target of a hostile article by Glass called "Hazardous to Your Mental Health." CSPI wrote a letter to the editor and issued a press release pointing out numerous inaccuracies and distortions, and hinting at possible plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[Center for Science in the Public Interest]]|url=http://www.cspinet.org/new/newrepb.html|title=Letter to the editor of ''The New Republic''|date=January 8, 1997|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016213721/http://cspinet.org/new/newrepb.html|archivedate=October 16, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education]] (D.A.R.E.) accused Glass of falsehoods in his March 1997 article "Don't You D.A.R.E."&lt;ref name=LastJ&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Jonathan V. Last|Jonathan Last]]|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/311bcigd.asp?pg=2 |title=Stopping Stephen Glass|work=[[The Weekly Standard]] |date=October 31, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1997, Joe Galli of the [[College Republicans#College Republican National Committee|College Republican National Committee]] accused Glass of fabrications in "Spring Breakdown", his lurid tale of drinking and debauchery at the 1997 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]]. A June 1997 article called "Peddling Poppy" about a [[Hofstra University]] conference on [[George H. W. Bush]] drew a letter from Hofstra reciting errors in the story.&lt;ref name=LastJ/&gt; ''The New Republic'' defended Glass; editor [[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]] demanded CSPI apologize to Stephen Glass.&lt;ref name=Bissinger/&gt;

On May 18, 1998 ''The New Republic'' published a story by Glass (by then an associate editor) entitled "Hack Heaven," purportedly telling the story of a 15-year-old [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] who had penetrated a company's computer network, then been hired by that company as a security consultant.
The article opened as follows:

{{quote|Ian Restil, a 15-year-old computer hacker who looks like an even more adolescent version of [[Bill Gates]], is throwing a tantrum. "I want more money. I want a [[Mazda MX-5 Miata|Miata]]. I want a trip to Disney World. I want X-Men comic [book] number one. I want a lifetime subscription to ''Playboy''{{snd}}and throw in ''Penthouse''. [[Jerry Maguire|Show me the money! Show me the money!]]{{nbsp}}..."

Across the table, executives from a California software firm called Jukt Micronics are listening and trying ever so delicately to oblige. "Excuse me, sir," one of the suits says tentatively to the pimply teenager. "Excuse me. Pardon me for interrupting you, sir. We can arrange more money for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephen Glass|url=http://penenberg.com/story-archive/hack-heaven/  |title=Washington Scene: Hack Heaven|work='The New Republic'|date=May 18, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Adam Penenberg]], a reporter with ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, became suspicious when he found zero search engine results for "Jukt Micronics," found that "Jukt Micronics" had just a single phone line, and saw that its website was extremely amateurish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Adam Penenberg]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/1998/05/11/otw3.html |title=Lies, damn lies, and fiction|work=[[Forbes]]|date=May 11, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenged, Glass claimed to have been duped by "Restil." Glass took [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]] to the [[Bethesda, Maryland]] hotel at which Restil had purportedly met with the Jukt executives; Lane discovered that on the day of the claimed meeting the hotel's conference room had been closed and the restaurant where the hackers supposedly ate dinner afterwards closes in the early afternoon.&lt;ref name=Bissinger/&gt; Lane dialed a [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] number provided by Glass and spoke with a man who identified himself as a Jukt executive; however, when he realized that the "executive" was actually Glass' brother, who attended [[Stanford University]] in Palo Alto, he fired Glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Fresh Air]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1509330 |title=Former Editor of 'The New Republic' Charles Lane|date=November 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lane later said:
{{quote|We extended normal human trust to someone who basically lacked a conscience... We busy, friendly folks, were no match for such a willful deceiver... We thought Glass was interested in our personal lives, or our struggles with work, and we thought it was because he cared. Actually, it was all about sizing us up and searching for vulnerabilities. What we saw as concern was actually contempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=January 2018}}{{cite web|url=http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/22523/sussing-out-a-charming-newsroom-sociopath-isnt-so-easy|title=Sussing out a charming newsroom sociopath isn't so easy|author=Jim Romenesko|date=May 3, 2004|publisher=[[Poynter Institute]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920101517/http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/22523/sussing-out-a-charming-newsroom-sociopath-isnt-so-easy/|archivedate=September 20, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Aftermath===
''The New Republic'' subsequently determined that at least 27 of the 41 articles Glass wrote for the magazine contained fabricated material. Some of the 27, such as "Don't You D.A.R.E.", contained real reporting interwoven with fabricated quotations and incidents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Glass|url=http://www.nationalfamilies.org/prevention/glass_letter.html |title=Letter to D.A.R.E. from Stephen Glass|publisher=[[National Families in Action]]|date=January 25, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others, including "Hack Heaven," were completely made up.&lt;ref name=60Min/&gt; In the process of creating the "Hack Heaven" article, Glass had gone to especially elaborate lengths to thwart the discovery of his deception by ''TNR''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[fact checker]]s: creating a website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031223023451/http://www.penenberg.com/jukt.html |url=http://www.penenberg.com/jukt.html |title=Fake "Jukt Micronics" page|archivedate=December 23, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[voice mail]] account for Jukt Micronics; fabricating notes of story gathering;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/120145/stephen-glass-new-republic-scandal-still-haunts-his-law-career |title=Hello, My Name Is Stephen Glass, and I'm Sorry|author=Hanna Rosin|work='The New Republic|date= November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; having fake business cards printed; and even composing editions of a fake computer hacker community newsletter.&lt;ref name=60Min/&gt;

As for the balance of the 41 stories, Lane, in an interview given for the 2005 DVD edition of ''Shattered Glass'', said, "In fact, I'd bet lots of the stuff in those other 14 is fake too. ... It's not like we're vouching for those 14, that they're true. They're probably not either." ''Rolling Stone'', ''George'', and ''Harper's'' also re-examined his contributions. ''Rolling Stone'' and ''Harper's'' found the material generally accurate yet maintained they had no way of verifying information because Glass had cited anonymous sources. ''George'' discovered that at least three of the stories Glass wrote for it contained fabrications.&lt;ref name=CNNLaw&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/16/justice/stephen-glass/index.html |title=Trust me, an infamous serial liar says|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Glass fabricated quotations in a profile piece and apologized to the article's subject, [[Vernon Jordan]], an adviser to then-President [[Bill Clinton]]. A court filing for Glass's application to the [[State Bar of California|California bar]] gave an updated count on his journalism career: 36 of his stories at ''The New Republic'' were said to be fabricated in part or in whole, along with three articles for ''George'', two articles for ''Rolling Stone'', and one for ''Policy Review''.&lt;ref name=CNNLaw/&gt;

==Later work==
After journalism, Glass earned a [[law degree]] at [[Georgetown University Law Center]]. He then passed the [[New York State bar]] [[Bar examination|examination]] in 2000, but the Committee of Bar Examiners refused to certify him on its moral fitness test, citing ethics concerns related to his [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref name="lawcom"&gt;{{cite web|author=Cheryl Miller|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/ca/PubArticleCA.jsp?id=1202532869843&amp;slreturn=1|title=Justices to Decide if Lying Journalist Fit to Practice Law|publisher=Law.com (subscription required)|date=November 17, 2011|accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later abandoned his efforts to be admitted to the bar in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/disgraced-ex-journalist-fights-ca-law-license-194254623.html |title=Disgraced ex-journalist fights for CA law license|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=December 27, 2011|accessdate=January 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Glass published a so-called "[[biographical novel]]", ''The Fabulist''.&lt;ref name=nyt2003&gt;{{cite news|author=David D. Kirkpatrick |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/07/books/a-history-of-lying-recounted-as-fiction.html |title=A History Of Lying Recounted As Fiction|work=The New York Times|date=May 7, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glass sat for an interview with the weekly news program ''[[60 Minutes]]'' timed to coincide with the release of his book. 
''The New Republic''{{'s}} literary editor, [[Leon Wieseltier]], complained, "The creep is doing it again. Even when it comes to reckoning with his own sins, he is still incapable of nonfiction. The careerism of his repentance is repulsively consistent with the careerism of his crimes."&lt;ref name=nyt2003/&gt; One reviewer of ''The Fabulist'' commented, "The irony—we must have irony in a tale this tawdry—is that Mr. Glass is abundantly talented.

Also in 2003, Glass briefly returned to journalism, writing an article about Canadian [[marijuana]] laws for ''Rolling Stone''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Glass|url=http://www.humanhemphealth.ca/Rolling_Stone_090403.html|title=Canada's Pot Revolution|work=Rolling Stone|date=September 4, 2003|access-date=August 1, 2007|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120803120818/http://www.humanhemphealth.ca/Rolling_Stone_090403.html|archive-date=August 3, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 7, 2003, Glass participated in a panel discussion on [[Journalism ethics and standards|journalistic ethics]] at [[George Washington University]], along with the editor who had hired him at ''The New Republic'', [[Andrew Sullivan]], who accused Glass of being a "serial liar" who was using "contrition as a career move."&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Jack Shafer]]|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2091015|title=Half a Glass: The incomplete contrition of serial liar Stephen Glass|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=November 7, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A film about the scandal, ''[[Shattered Glass (film)|Shattered Glass]]'', was released in October 2003 and depicted a stylized view of Glass's rise and fall at ''The New Republic''. The film, appearing shortly after ''[[The New York Times]]'' suffered a similar [[plagiarism]] scandal with the discovery of [[Jayson Blair]]'s fabrications, occasioned critiques of the journalism industry itself by nationally prominent journalists such as [[Frank Rich]] and [[Mark Bowden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Howard Good |year= 2007|title=Journalism Ethics Goes to the Movies|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|chapter=2|isbn=978-0742554283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass was out of the public eye for several years following the release of his novel and the film. In 2007, he was performing with a Los Angeles comedy troupe known as [[Un-Cabaret]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncabaret.com/posse.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030065403/http://www.uncabaret.com/posse.html |title=Un-Cabaret Talent|archivedate=October 30, 2007|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; having earlier found employment at a small law firm, apparently as a paralegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2007/10/postscript200710 |title=Shattered Glass|date=October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Glass again made the news after reportedly sending ''Harper's Magazine'' a check for $10,000 – what he was paid for the false articles – writing in the attached letter that he wanted "to make right that part of my many transgressions...I recognize that repaying Harper's will not remedy my wrongdoing, make us even, or undo what I did wrong. That said, I did not deserve the money that Harper's paid me and it should be returned."&lt;ref name=nyt2015&gt;{{cite news|author=Ravi Somaiya |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/17/business/media/stephen-glass-repays-harpers-10000-for-his-discredited-work.html |title=Stephen Glass Repays Harper's $10,000 for His Discredited Work|work=The New York Times|date=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unsuccessful California bar application==

In 2009 Glass applied to join the [[State Bar of California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/magazine/30Peretz-t.html?pagewanted=all |title=Martin Peretz Is Not Sorry About Anything|work=The New York Times|date=January 24, 2011|author=Stephen Rodrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee of Bar Examiners refused to certify him, finding that he did not satisfy California's moral fitness test because of his history of journalistic deception.&lt;ref name="lawcom" /&gt; Insisting that he had reformed, Glass then petitioned the State Bar Court's hearing department, which found that Glass possessed the necessary "good moral character" to be admitted as an attorney.&lt;ref name="lawcom"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNLaw/&gt;

The Committee of Bar Examiners sought review in the State Bar's Review Department and filed a Writ of Review, thereby petitioning the California Supreme Court to review the decision.&lt;ref name="lawcom" /&gt; On November 16, 2011, the Supreme Court granted the petition, the first time in 11 years the court had granted review in a moral character case.&lt;ref name="lawcom"/&gt; On January 3, 2012, Glass's attorneys filed papers with the Court arguing that his behavior had been irreproachable for more than 13 years and this was proof that he had reformed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bob Egelko|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/01/04/BAR61MKF5L.DTL |title=Disgraced journalist Stephen Glass makes his case|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2013, the California Supreme Court heard arguments in Glass's case and ruled unanimously against him in an opinion issued January 27, 2014. The lengthy opinion describes in minute detail the applicant's history, record, the bar's applicable standard of review, the appeal, and its own analysis of how Glass failed to satisfy the court's standards, concluding, "On this record, he has not sustained his heavy burden of demonstrating rehabilitation and fitness for the practice of law."&lt;ref name="In Re Glass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scocal.stanford.edu/sites/scocal.stanford.edu/files/opinion-pdf/S196374-1390849835.pdf |title=In Re Glass|publisher=[[Supreme Court of California]] |date=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this decision, Glass was barred from practicing law in the State of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Maura Dolan|title=Disgraced journalist Stephen Glass unlikely to ever be lawyer|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-stephen-glass-lawyer-ruling-20140128,0,1280859.story#axzz2rixUCEx0|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=[[LA Times]]|date=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teatro Español''' ("Español Theatre" &amp;ndash; former '''Teatro del Príncipe''' and '''Corral del Príncipe''') is a public theater administered by the Government of [[Madrid]], Spain. The prime location was an open-air theater in medieval times where small venues and some theatrical pieces, which formed famous classical literature in later years, were staged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teatroespanol.es/teatro_espanol_madrid/index.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309014216/http://www.teatroespanol.es/teatro_espanol_madrid/index.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 March 2011|title=El Teatro Español|language=Spanish|accessdate=23 August 2013|publisher=Official website of El Teatro Español}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its establishment was authorized by a decree of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in 1565.&lt;ref name="Teatro Espanol"&gt;{{cite web|last=Teatro Espanol|title=El Teatro Español|url=http://www.teatroespanol.es/teatro_espanol_madrid/historia.php|publisher=Teatroespanol.es|accessdate=21 August 2013|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619171727/http://www.teatroespanol.es/teatro_espanol_madrid/historia.php|archivedate=19 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th century also marked the definitive consecration of Teatro del Príncipe, which had its own group of followers, the "chorizos," in constant struggle with the "polacos," who preferred the scenarios of the rival [[Teatro de la Cruz]]. By this time, Leandro Fernández de Moratín premiered ''La comedia nueva'' at Teatro del Príncipe. On 11 July 1802, the theater was engulfed by fire, to be re-opened five years later&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Las Cenizas Del Príncipe|last=Balaguer|first=Luis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oRqHfUDCM1UC&amp;pg=PA16|isbn=9788483710180|date=1998-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the conclusion of the renovation work led by [[Juan de Villanueva]].&lt;ref name=Thomason&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomason|first=Phillip Brian|title=El Coliseo De La Cruz 1736-1860: Estudio Y Documentos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JjLA41GrxHUC&amp;pg=PA32|isbn=9781855661141|date=2005-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current building, erected in [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style according to a design of Román Guerrero, was built between 1887 and 1895 under the direction of Natalio Grueso. In the foreground of the theater is [[Plaza de Santa Ana]], built after the demolishion of a 16th-century [[Carmelite]] monastery.{{sfn|Minchot|2002|p=88}}{{sfn|Corral|2008|p=139}}{{sfn|Minchot|2002|p=88}} The names of famous theater personalities are engraved on the façade, among them the name of [[Federico García Lorca]].{{sfn|Duncan|2007|p=76}}

==History==

===Teatro del Príncipe===
The former ''Teatro del Príncipe,'' or ''Corral del Príncipe,'' was a theatre of [[zarzuela]]s acquired by the brotherhood ''Cofradía de la Pasión y de la Soledad'' on 9 February 1580.&lt;ref name="Ayuntamiento de Madrid"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayuntamiento de Madrid|title=Síntesis histórica: de corral a coliseo|url=http://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/Ayuntamiento/Cultura-y-Ocio/Teatro-Espa%C3%B1ol?vgnextfmt=default&amp;vgnextoid=f9a0ed2db6348010VgnVCM100000dc0ca8c0RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=0c369e242ab26010VgnVCM100000dc0ca8c0RCRD&amp;idCapitulo=1100735|publisher=Madri.es|accessdate=21 August 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of that year, ''Corral de la Pacheca'' was acquired by the same brotherhood, which also bought two other buildings from Álava de Ibarra, doctor to [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], and another sold by Don Rodrigo de Herrera. It was built from 7 May 1582 with opening on 21 September of the following year with a play by Vázquez and [[John of Ávila]].&lt;ref name="Ayuntamiento de Madrid"/&gt;

The theatre consisted of a stage, costume room, [[bleacher]]s for men, ninety five portable banks, a [[hall]] for women, balconies with iron [[Guard rail|rail]]ings or [[grille]]s, master channels and roofs covering the stands.&lt;ref name="Ayuntamiento de Madrid"/&gt; The courtyard was paved and an [[awning]] made to block the sun, but not the rain.&lt;ref name="Ayuntamiento de Madrid"/&gt; This original structure was maintained until 1735, when a new building, concluded in ten years, was erected by architect Juan Bautista Sacchetti in cooperation with Ventura Rodríguez.&lt;ref name=RTVE&gt;{{cite web|last=RTVE|title=Teatro Español nos muestra sus secretos y su alma|url=http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20120917/teatro-espanol-mas-400-actividad-teatral-muestra-secretos/563743.shtml|publisher=RTVE|accessdate=21 August 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time its name was changed from Corral del Príncipe to Teatro del Príncipe.{{sfn|Montoliú|2002|p=285}} Later, the site became a theater of work which was one of the largest in the country. In 1849, it was transformed into the current Teatro Español,&lt;ref name=Hemeroteca&gt;{{cite web|last=Hemeroteca|title=El Teatro|url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/blanco.y.negro/1925/01/18/096.html|publisher=Hemeroteca.abc.es|accessdate=21 August 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only theater in Madrid really similar to an ancient open-air theater.

During the reign of Philip II, the City Council in Madrid established two permanent playhouses or "corrales". One was ''Corral de la Cruz'' and the other ''Teatro del Principe,'' both housed at [[San Sebastian Church, Madrid|Igelsia de San Sebastian]]. The fervor for theater plays among the population was so intense that two corral groups were formed, the "chorizos" and "polacos." The followers of the first group were [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] and [[Lope de Vega]], and the second the "nobility." The rivalry between them was so intense to the extent of disturbing each other's programmes and closing theatres under the orders of Count Arnada, minister of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]].{{sfn|Minchot|2002|p=88}}

In the 18th century both theaters were demolished and rebuilt in [[Neo Classical|Italian architectural style]] with modern facilities such as an expansive stage with mechanized operation and artificial lighting.{{sfn|Minchot|2002|p=88}}

===Teatro Español===
In 1825, under the direction of French impresario [[John Grimaldi]], the theatre underwent a series of improvements such as lighting and props in both structural and artistic fields. By royal decree, Teatro del Príncipe changed its name to Teatro Español in 1849. Its capacity was of 1,200 spectators and the owner the City Council,&lt;ref name=Lissorgues-Andreu&gt;{{cite book|last=Alicia G. Andreu|first=Yvan Lissorgues|title=Realismo y naturalismo en España en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0gyzHMnxTIC&amp;pg=PA143|isbn=9788476580967}}&lt;/ref&gt; leased by the Government of Spain. Under the leadership of Minister of Internal Affairs José Luis Sartorius, a new model theatre was installed with the staging of ''Casa con dos puertas, mala es de guardar'' by [[Calderon de la Barca]], on 8 April 1849.&lt;ref name=Gies&gt;{{cite book|last=Gies|first=David Thatcher|title=The Theatre in Nineteenth-Century Spain|year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHssjR98BJoC&amp;pg=PA35|isbn=9780521020237}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The playwright Ventura de la Vega was appointed director of the theater. A year later he was replaced by Tomás Rodríguez Rubí, until in May 1851 the theater passed back to the management of the municipality.&lt;ref name=Schinasi&gt;{{cite book|last=Schinasi|first=Michael|title=Ventura de la Vega, Tomás Rodríguez Rubí y la lucha por el Teatro Español|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQC2sla8WA4C&amp;pg=PA390|isbn=9788400077686}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, actor Manuel Catalina became director of the theatre.&lt;ref name=Tamayo&gt;{{cite book|last=Tamayo|first=Vitorino|title=El elegante Manuel Catalina|url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/blanco.y.negro/1927/03/27/086.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Teatro Español underwent a major change in its legal status. It reopened on 15 April 1939, coinciding with the death anniversary of Serafín Álvarez Quintero. The ownership of the facility remained in the hands of the City Council, although the management was assumed by the Government of Spain. Between the end of the war and the mid-1940s, the concession of the theatre was handed over to the companies of Ana Adamuz, Nini Montian-Guillermo Marin, Fernando Díaz de Mendoza y Guerrero-María Guerrero López.&lt;ref name=Oliva&gt;{{cite book|last=Oliva|first=César|title=Versos y trazas: (un recorrido personal por la comedia española)|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ccMNWYLPiEYC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;lpg=PA220|isbn=9788483718605}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a ministerial order of March 1940, a national council of theatres was created with two sections: Teatro Nacional Español,  staging classic authors, and [[Teatro María Guerrero]]. The season opened on November 13 of that year with ''La Celestina.''&lt;ref name=Carabantes&gt;{{cite web|last=Carabantes|first=Manuel Muñoz|title=Puesta en escena y recepción del Teatro Clásico y Medieval en España|url=http://eprints.ucm.es/tesis/19911996/H/3/AH3000903.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizational unit was in charge of the Ministry of Education of Spain and the National Ministry of Education until 1951, and the Ministry of Information and Tourism from then on. After ten consecutive years, the management of the theatre was in the hands of Cayetano Luca de Tena, until in 1954 the authorities handed over the administration to José Tamayo and his company "Lope de Vega," in which actors Carlos Lemos, [[Núria Espert]], [[Adolfo Marsillach]] and Berta Riaza performed. During the years of dictatorship, literary milestones such as ''Historia de una escalera'' and the introduction of contemporary foreign authors such as [[J.B.

{{Egyptian Dynasty list}}

The '''Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt''' (notated '''Dynasty XXVI''', alternatively '''26th Dynasty''' or '''Dynasty 26''') was the last native [[List of ancient Egyptian dynasties|dynasty]] to rule [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] before the [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian conquest]] in 525 BC (although others followed). The dynasty's reign (664–525 BC) is also called the '''Saite Period''' after the city of [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]], where its [[pharaoh]]s had their capital, and marks the beginning of the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;Aidan Dodson, Dyan Hilton. ''The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt''. The American University in Cairo Press, London 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This dynasty traced its origins to the [[Twenty-fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fourth Dynasty]]. [[Psamtik I]] was probably a descendant of [[Bakenranef]], and following the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]'s invasions during the reigns of [[Taharqa]] and [[Tantamani]], he was recognized as sole king over all of Egypt. While the Neo-Assyrian Empire was preoccupied with revolts and civil war over control of the throne, Psamtik threw off his ties to the Assyrians circa 655 BC, formed alliances with King [[Gyges of Lydia]], and recruited mercenaries from [[Caria]] and [[ancient Greece]] to resist Assyrian attacks.

With the sack of [[Nineveh]] in 612 BC and the fall of the Assyrian Empire, both Psamtik and his successors attempted to reassert Egyptian power in the Near East, but were driven back by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] under [[Nebuchadnezzar II]]. With the help of Greek mercenaries, [[Apries]] was able to hold back Babylonian attempts to conquer Egypt, only for the Persians to eventually do so. Their king, [[Cambyses II]], captured and later executed [[Psamtik III]].

==Pharaohs of the 26th Dynasty==
{{Main article|List of pharaohs}}The 26th Dynasty may be related to the [[Twenty-fourth Dynasty of Egypt|24th Dynasty]]. Manetho begins the dynasty with:
* Ammeris the Nubian, 12 (or 18) years
* Stephinates, 7 years
* Nechepsos, 6 years
* Necho, 8 years.

When the Nubian King [[Shabaka]] defeated Bakenranef, son of [[Tefnakht]], he likely installed a Nubian commander as governor at Sais. This may be the man named [[Ammeris]]. Stephinates may be a descendant of Bakenrenef. He is sometimes referred to as [[Tefnakht II]] in the literature. Nechepsos has been identified with a local king named [[Nekauba]] (678–672 BC). Manetho's Necho is King [[Necho I]] (672–664 BC); Manetho gives his reign as 8 years.&lt;ref name="SIP"&gt;Kitchen, Kenneth A. ''The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt, 1100-650 B.C.'' (Book &amp; Supplement) Aris &amp; Phillips. 1986 {{ISBN|978-0-85668-298-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Necho was killed during a conflict with the Nubian king [[Tantamani]]. Psamtik&amp;nbsp;I fled to [[Nineveh]] – capital of the Neo-Assyrian Empire – and returned to Egypt when [[Ashurbanipal]] defeated Tantamani and drove him back south.&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt; Scholars now start the 26th Dynasty with the reign of [[Psamtik I]].&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SIP"/&gt;

[[Sextus Julius Africanus]] states in his often accurate version of Manetho's ''Epitome'' that the dynasty numbered 9 pharaohs, beginning with a "Stephinates" ([[Tefnakht II]]) and ending with Psamtik III. Africanus also notes that [[Psamtik I]] and [[Necho I]] ruled for 54 and 8 years respectively.

'''''Vincent''''' is an opera in three acts by [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]] first performed in 1990. The libretto is by the composer, and consists of scenes from the life of the artist [[Vincent van Gogh]], told in retrospect.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Arni E. Vincent. In: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The opera==
''Vincent'', the composer’s fourth full-length opera, was first performed at the [[Aleksanterin Teatteri|Helsinki Opera House]] on 17 May 1990. The idea of the piece emerged when Jorma Hynninen, showing a photo of himself to Rautavaara, asked the composer who he looked like. The answer was Van Gogh; Hynninen created the title role, and recorded it the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Fairman R. Vintage Van Gogh (Review of first performance). ''[[Opera (magazine)|Opera]]'', October 1990, 1228.&lt;/ref&gt;
German performances took place in Kiel and Hagen in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Luys Thomas. Report from Hagen, ''Opera'', February 1992, p209-210.&lt;/ref&gt;
Told in flashback, the opera revolves around Vincent’s relationships with the prostitute Maria, his fellow painter [[Paul Gauguin]] and his brother Theo. The orchestral preludes are named after three of Van Gogh’s paintings. The score covers both serialism and tonal writing, with colourful orchestration.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; Rautavaara used some material from the opera in his 6th symphony [[Vincentiana]].

==Synopsis==

After an orchestral prelude ''([[The Starry Night|Starry Night]])'', the first act opens in the mental hospital of [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]], amidst the sounds of the other inmates, along with Doctor Rey, his secretary, the hospital priest and chief guard. Vincent hears voices and his mind is cast back to his childhood. When called to supper Vincent offers twelve other patients his flesh and blood, but they flee, terrified. Vincent recalls his art and his friendship with his brother Theo. Next Vincent has visions of a mining accident in the village of [[Borinage]], followed by other incidents from his childhood, and then Maria Hoornik. After recalling a meeting where Vincent, as a lay preacher, gives a political and religious sermon, and its aftermath, he promises sun and light for those in darkness. The act closes with an extended duet for Theo and Gaby reflecting on spirit and inspiration.

The second act is prefaced by another orchestral section (''[[Wheatfield with Crows]]''), and the scene changes to an art exhibition where a professor, an artist, an aesthete and a critic discuss the works. After an argument between Paul and Maria, she tells Vincent to look in the mirror to see lies in his reflection. Vincent smashes the mirror; Maria goes, and the critics turn on Vincent. After they have gone, against Theo’s advice Paul incites Vincent to experience visions, but stops before these go too far. But the room changes into a bordello, with the women as the professionals of the house and the critics providing entertainment. When they all go upstairs, Vincent is prey to feelings of solitude. He paints a door on the wall, and through it, Gaby enters. They begin to dance and others return, and as the waltz becomes more ecstatic Vincent cuts off his ear, as an offering to the sun. The others reject him and a flock of blackbirds circles around him, blocking out the light.

Act 3 (Epilogue) opens with an orchestral prelude (''[[The Church at Auvers]]''). Back in the hospital in Saint-Remy Vincent shows his latest painting to Doctor Rey, but the doctor declines, afraid of the ridicule the possession of such a piece would bring. The guard and secretary also refuse but the priest takes it, hoping to sell it to get money for good works. His last monologue moves from disillusion to love for the visions of life, and slowly other voices join in; he finishes praising the sun, summer and life.

'''What The Hack''' was an outdoor [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] conference held in [[Liempde]], [[Netherlands]] between the 28th and 31st of July, 2005. 

==Timeline==
What the Hack was an event in a sequence that began with the [[Galactic Hacker Party]] in 1989, followed by [[Hacking at the End of the Universe]] in 1993, [[Hacking In Progress]] in 1997, [[Hackers At Large]] in 2001 and [[Hacking at Random]] in 2009. The most recent edition was [[Observe. Hack. Make.]] in 2013.

==Attendance==
[[Image:Wth police truck.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Mobile police office]]
Over 2000 hackers visited the event to participate in an exchange on several technical, social and philosophical matters of importance to the technically inclined community. 

Visitors from all over the world arrived at the Camp Ground including groups of such diversity as [[OpenBSD]] developers, the German [[Chaos Computer Club]], members of the ''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly]]'' hackergroup, and numerous smaller groups and organisations in addition.

While planning the event, there were several issues with the local government attempting to cancel the event because of "the risk for public security".

[[File:Peg dhcp from what the hack holland 2005.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Peg-DHCP allocation]]
Several smaller events were embedded in or inspired by this event like the [[Hacktrain]], which was planned to travel there, as well as the local radio station, and the smaller Police village which featured specialists from their [[information technology|IT]] Department, as well as interested government parties. [[Peg DHCP]] ({{IETF RFC|2322}}) was used during the event to allocate IP addresses. The method had been first devised and used at Hacking In Progress.

==Activities==
Some of the lectures and events this edition were:
* Reverse engineering Microsoft .NET
* Cyborgs: Practical Experimentation
* Attacks on Digital Passports
* Using Linux for Embedded Devices
* Doing a WiFi Long-Shot
* Symbian Security
* Do We Run Out of Oil?
* How to Lower Electricity Consumption in Your Home
* The Politics of Psychedelic Research
* OpenStreetMap

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4201">''World Art Day'' (Rittik Day) is an international celebration of the fine arts which was declared by the [[International Association of Art]] (IAA) in order to promote awareness of creative activity worldwide.&lt;ref name=ownpage&gt;{{cite web |title=Why World Art Day? |publisher=International Association of Art |url= http://iaaworldartday.com/why-wad/ |accessdate=February 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sciencelens&gt;{{cite news |author=Gerry La Roux |title= Celebrating art and creativity on World Art Day |publisher= Science Lens  |location=New Zealand |date=April 15, 2013 |url= http://sciencelens.co.nz/2013/04/15/world-art-day/|accessdate=February 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
A proposal was put forward at the 17th General Assembly of the International Association of Art  in [[Guadalajara]] to declare April 15 as World Art Day, with the first celebration held in 2012. This proposal was sponsored by [[Bedri Baykam]] of Turkey and co-signed by Rosa Maria Burillo Velasco of Mexico, Anne Pourny of France, Liu Dawei of China, Christos Symeonides of [[Cyprus]], Anders Liden of Sweden, Kan Irie of Japan, Pavel Kral of [[Slovakia]], Dev Chooramun of [[Mauritius]], and Hilde Rognskog of [[Norway]]. It was accepted unanimously by the General Assembly.&lt;ref name=ownpage/&gt;&lt;ref name=hurriyet&gt;{{cite news |title= World Art Day to be celebrated April 15 |newspaper= Hürriyet Daily News  |location=Istanbul |date=April 11, 2012 |url= http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/world-art-day-to-be-celebrated-april-15.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=18099&amp;NewsCatID=359 |accessdate=February 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elunicaracas&gt;{{cite news |title= Día Mundial del Arte se celebra este sábado en Caracas |publisher= El Universal |location=Caracas |date=April 12, 2012 |url= http://www.eluniversal.com/arte-y-entretenimiento/cultura/120412/dia-mundial-del-arte-se-celebra-este-sabado-en-caracas |accessdate=February 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The date was decided in honor of the birthday of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Da Vinci  was chosen as a symbol world peace, freedom of expression, tolerance, brotherhood and multiculturalism as well as art’s importance to other fields.&lt;ref name=sciencelens/&gt;&lt;ref name=elunicaracas/&gt;

==Past celebrations==
The first World Art Day on April 15, 2012 was supported by all IAA national committees and 150 artists, including those of France, Sweden, Slovakia, South Africa, Cyprus and Venezuela, but the intention of the event is universal.&lt;ref name=hurriyet/&gt;&lt;ref name=elunicaracas/&gt; Events varied from special museum hours to conferences and more.&lt;ref name=ownpage/&gt; For example Venezuela held outdoor art exhibitions with paintings, sculptures, prints, video and more, as well as a Florentine cooking demonstration in honor of Da Vinci.&lt;ref name=elunicaracas/&gt;

More events were held in 2013 all over the world including the [[Mbombela]] municipal art museum in South Africa.&lt;ref name=mbombela&gt;{{cite web |title= "World Art Day" Exhibition |publisher= MBombela Art Gallery |location=South Africa |url=  http://www.mbombela.gov.za/drysdale%20street%20world%20art%20day%20exhibition.pdf|accessdate=February 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was controversy at celebrations in Sweden when the Swedish minister of Culture, [[Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth]], cut into the genitals of a cake representing a black African woman. The performance art was meant to be a statement against [[genital mutilation]] but many found the depiction racist.&lt;ref name=ysimpore&gt;{{cite news |author=Yacine Simporé |title= Swedish Minister celebrates World Art day by slicing into a Black woman, cake |publisher= Amsterdam News |location=New York |date=April 22, 2013 |url= http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2013/apr/22/swedish-minister-celebrates-world-art-day-by/|accessdate=February 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Art Day has also been supported online, especially by the [[Google Art Project]].&lt;ref name=epalmermo&gt;{{cite news |author=Elizabeth Palermo |title= Van Gogh’s 'Starry Night' Most-Loved Painting on Google  |publisher= TechNewsDaily |date=April 15, 2013 |url= http://www.technewsdaily.com/17753-google-art-project.html |accessdate=February 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Cleanup Day''' (also known as '''WCD''') is a global [[social action]] program aimed at combating the global solid waste problem, including the problem of [[marine debris]]. The first World Cleanup Day was September 15, 2018, beginning at 10 a.m., and spanning the world's time zones until concluding near the international date line in Hawaii.

==Purpose==

World Cleanup Day is held over the course of a 24-hour period, usually in mid-September.  There are numerous organizations that facilitate and host World Cleanup Day events globally.  Like [[Earth Day]], World Cleanup Day is non-partisan, apolitical, and is not affiliated with any national or global [[political party]] or discrete [[ideology]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thejournal.ie/world-cleanup-day-ireland-4224661-Sep2018/ 'Communities will be united': Groups around Ireland to take part in World Cleanup Day". ''The Journal''. September 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;   

==History==
Global cleanup efforts have existed in many forms throughout human history, especially after widespread catastrophes such as [[earthquakes]], [[floods]], and powerful [[tsunamis]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/23/2004-tsunami-five-years-on After the 2004 tsunami: rebuilding lives, salvaging communities]". ''The Guardian''. December 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In modern history, these efforts are typically undertaken by the affected communities, with support from various [[international organizations]] and [[NGO]]s, such as [[Red Cross]], [[Oxfam]], and other [[Relief organization|relief organizations]] but typically in post-conflict zones.  They have included efforts to remove [[land mines]], [[beach cleanup]], and other municipal and non-governmental actions.

==Organizers==
World Cleanup Day is a [[decentralized network]], made of different [[grassroots]] efforts. One of the largest organizers of global cleanup efforts is [[Let's Do It! World]].  Founded in Estonia, the organization successfully mobilized more than 50,000 volunteers for a single-day, country-wide cleanup effort that resulted in the elimination of 10,000 tons of illegal waste.  The Estonian action, called [[Let's Do It 2008]] emerged as a global model, spreading globally thereafter.  Today, the movement has grown into a network of 150 countries. All together, more than 14.5 million participants have been engaged in the movement's activities.

==Participants== 
Participants in World Cleanup Days are typically [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s, with coordination from [[non-governmental organizations]] who assist in awareness-raising, logistics, and fundraising.
