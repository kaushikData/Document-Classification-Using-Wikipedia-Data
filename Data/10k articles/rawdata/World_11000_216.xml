== History ==
The brigade was formed in June 2009 as part of the [[20th Guards Army]] in [[Mulino (settlement), Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Mulino]] from the 100th Tank Regiment. The 100th Tank Regiment was originally formed as the [[100th Tank Brigade (Soviet Union)|100th Tank Brigade]] in 1942. For its actions during [[World War II]], the brigade was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]], the [[Order of Kutuzov]] 2nd class, and the honorific "Czestochowa".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1945 the brigade, part of the [[31st Tank Corps (Soviet Union)|31st Tank Corps]], became the 100th Tank Regiment as part of a reorganization of the Soviet Tank Troops. At the same time the corps became the 31st Tank Division. The regiment was based in [[Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine|Khmelnitsky]]. The regiment fought in [[Operation Danube]], the suppression of the [[Prague Spring]]. After the end of the operation the regiment stayed in Czechoslovakia with the division and was based at [[FrenÅ¡tÃ¡t pod RadhoÅ¡tÄm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ww2.dk/new/army/td/31td.htm|title=31st Tank Division|last=Holm|first=Michael|date=|website=www.ww2.dk|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1990 the regiment withdrew to [[Dzerzhinsk, Russia|Dzerzhinsk]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''African Sources for African History''''' is a [[Monographic series|book series]] published by [[Brill Publishers|Brill]] that aims to make available [[critical edition]]s of indigenous African narrative sources from [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brill.com/publications/african-sources-african-history African Sources for African History] Brill, 2014. Retrieved 17 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The series aims to expand the sources available to historians of Africa, and to rectify bias that may have been introduced into the writing of [[African history]] through an over-reliance on sources written by Europeans.

The first in the series was the 2001 ''Somono Bala of the Upper Niger'', an epic story of fishing people, translated into English from the [[Maninka]] language for the first time.

The ruins are the remains of structures created by people who settled the region in the 16th century and who altered the landscape to increase agricultural yields in high-altitude grasslands.&lt;ref name="bokoni"&gt;{{cite news |author=Amanda Esterhuysen |title=The Bokoni story unearthed |url=https://mg.co.za/article/2015-02-26-the-bokoni-story-unearthed |quote= |pages= |work=Mail and Guardian |location= |date=27 February 2015 |accessdate=2018-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone rings are believed to have been used as enclosures for cattle ([[kraal]]s).&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/prehistory-nelspruit-area |title=Prehistory of the Nelspruit area |author=T.

The Blaauboskraal stone ruins are among a number of stone circle ruins located in the Mpumalanga [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|escarpment]] over an area of approximately 150 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a number of which are facing threats to conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sizwe sama Yende |title=Heritage under threat |url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/heritage-under-threat-20170916 |quote= |pages= |work=News 24/City Press |location= |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2018-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about the people who created these stone circles and terraces was often omitted from South African historical sources.&lt;ref name="bokoni"/&gt;

==Alternate theories==
Alternate theories exist of alien or ancient origins.  The most prominent proponent of an alternate origin, politician [[Michael Tellinger]], calls the site "Adam's Calendar" and claims they are remains of the oldest man-made site in the world built by [[Enki]] 300,000 years ago as an ancient calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/adams-calendar|title=Adam's Calendar|website=Atlas Obscura}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=news24/&gt;&lt;ref name=hp/&gt;&lt;ref name=abs/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1964">'''The Economy of San Marino''' is focused around industries such as [[bank]]ing, [[clothing|wearing apparel]], including fabrics, [[electronics]], [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], tiles, furniture, paints, and spirits/wines. In addition, [[San Marino]] sells collectible [[postage stamp]]s to [[philately|philatelists]].  The main [[agriculture|agricultural product]]s are [[wine]] and [[cheese]]s.

== Overview ==
The per capita level of output and [[standard of living]] are comparable to those of [[Italy]], which supplies much of its food. In addition, San Marino has a state [[Government budget|budget surplus]] and no [[government debt|national debt]]. [[Income tax]]es are much lower than in Italy, and there are therefore extremely strict requirements to obtain citizenship. San Marino's per capita [[gross national product]] in 2000 stood at $32,000 with more than 50% of that coming from the tourism industry which draws about 3.15 million people annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = San Marino|url = https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5387.htm|accessdate = 2015-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in citation given|date=April 2017}}

==Coins and stamps==
One of the greatest sources of income from tourism comes from the sale of historic coins and [[Postage stamps and postal history of San Marino|stamps]]. In 1894, San Marino issued the first [[commemorative stamp]]s and since then that has been part of a large livelihood in the republic. All 10 of the [[Post office|Post Offices]] of San Marino sell these stamps and collectible coins, including "Legal Gold Tender Coins".

Traditional economic activities in San Marino were food crops, [[sheep husbandry|sheep farming]], and [[quarry|stone quarrying]]. Today farming activities focus on [[grain]], [[vine]]s and [[orchard]]s, as well as [[animal husbandry]] (cattle and swine).

'''PÃµhimaantee 4''' (ofcl. abbr. '''T4''') is a 192-kilometre long&lt;ref&gt;https://teeregister.riik.ee/mnt/index/report/road/show.do?resultID=1cca065bf197065b59c958af0b0f11&amp;reportID=0cca022bf197022b59c958af0b0f11&lt;/ref&gt; north-south national main road in Estonia. The route follows the same path as the [[European route E67]], also known as the Via Baltica. The highway starts in Tallinn. From there the main cities passed are Saue, MÃ¤rjamaa and PÃ¤rnu. The highway ends in Ikla at the Latvian border.

The road forms a major transport north-south transport route between [[Estonia]] and [[Central Europe|Central]]/[[Western Europe]]. In 2015, the highest traffic volumes were around Tallinn, with the AADT there being around 31 000. These are the highest figures in Estonia. The figures rise again around PÃ¤rnu, hovering around 10 000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnt.ee/public/liiklusloendus/Lisa_6-8_2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The road is a [[dual carriageway]] for 14,1 kilometres. The section is between [[Laagri]] and [[ÃÃ¤smÃ¤e]]. The section between ÃÃ¤smÃ¤e and Kernu will be expanded to 2+1 in 2016-2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://riigihanked.riik.ee/register/hange/176118&lt;/ref&gt; Another section to be expanded is between JÃ¤nesselja and Nurme, also to be expanded to 2+1.

==Route description==
The T4 is a major north-south highway in Estonia connecting the capital of the country, [[Tallinn]], to the fourth largest city in Estonia, [[PÃ¤rnu]], and ultimately the [[Latvia]]n border (where the Latvian [[A1 (Latvia)|A1]] continues to [[Riga]]). The T4 is a part of the [[European route E67]], also known as the Via Baltica.

The route bypasses all cities and towns, only having a 13-kilometre stretch in Tallinn. The highway begins in Tallinn from Viru VÃ¤ljak and runs through the city for 13 kilometres. In the city, it intersects with the T8 at Vabaduse vÃ¤ljak and the T15 at JÃ¤rve. Shortly after crossing city borders, the road turns into a dual carriageway and interchanges with the T11 at Saue. At kilometre 27, the road meets with the T9 and turns into a 1+1 road. The road continues in a straight, southbound manner until PÃ¤rnu.

At PÃ¤rnu, the road turns left onto the PÃ¤rnu bypass (with a 70&amp;nbsp;km/h speed limit). The road has an intersection with the T5 here and crosses the PÃ¤rnu river. After this, the road turns left again, and shortly after PÃ¤rnu intersects with the T6. Afterwards the route follows the Estonian coast until Ikla, where the Latvian border is crossed and the road continues as the [[A1 (Latvia)|A1]] in Latvia.

Currently there are 11 speed cameras on the T4, between kilometres 92 and 141.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnt.ee/index.php?id=25085&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francesco Grimaldi''' ('''FranÃ§ois''', in French), called '''''il Malizia''''' ("''the malicious''"), was the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] leader of the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]]s who captured the [[Rock of Monaco]] on the night of 8 January 1297. He was the son of Guglielmo Grimaldi by his wife Giacobina or Giacoba, a Genoese noble.

Dressed as a [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan]] monk, Francesco was greeted at the gates of [[Prince's Palace of Monaco|Monaco's castle]], only then to seize the castle with his cousin [[Rainier I of Monaco, Lord of Cagnes|Rainier I]], Lord of [[Cagnes-sur-Mer|Cagnes]], and a group of men behind him. The event is commemorated on the [[Coat of arms of Monaco|Monegasque coat of arms]], on which the supporters are two monks armed with swords. He held the citadel of Monaco for four years before being chased out by the Genoese. The battle over "the rock" was taken over by his kinsmen. Francesco thus failed to establish Grimaldi's rule over [[Monaco]], but was the first to attempt to do so.

He was married in 1295 to [[Aurelia del Carretto]]; the marriage was childless. The modern Grimaldis are therefore not descendants of Francesco. After his death, in 1309, he was succeeded by his cousin (and stepson), [[Rainier I of Monaco|Rainier I]], Lord of Cagnes.

His cousin's descendants, the [[House of Grimaldi|Grimaldi]] family, still rule Monaco today. Over one hundred years after the coup, the Grimaldis purchased Monaco from the [[crown of Aragon]] in 1419, and became the official and undisputed rulers of "the Rock of Monaco".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://monaco.me/ |title=Monaco â The Principality of Monaco |publisher=Monaco.me |date=|accessdate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wood, Gar Mr., - NARA - 279714.jpg|thumb|Garfield Wood]]
[[Image:gar wood.gif|right|thumb|300px|Gar Wood returns the [[Harmsworth Trophy]] to the United States in 1920]]

'''Garfield Arthur "Gar" Wood''' (December 4, 1880 &amp;ndash; June 19, 1971) was an American [[inventor]], [[entrepreneur]], and championship [[motorboat]] builder and racer who held the world [[water speed record]] on several occasions. He was the first man to travel over 100 miles per hour on water.

==Early life==
[[Image:Miss America 2 1921.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Miss America 2, 1921 [[Harmsworth Trophy]] winner]]
Gar Wood was born on December 4, 1880 in [[Mapleton, Iowa|Mapleton]], [[Iowa]], into a family of 13 children.&lt;ref Name=PM&gt;{{cite journal| last=Fix| first=John| date=July 1967| title=Gar Wood: An Old Sea Dog Is Up to New Tricks| journal=[[Popular Mechanics]]| pages=82â85| url=https://books.google.com/?id=x9MDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=gar+wood+boat| accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a ferryboat operator on [[Lake Osakis]], [[Minnesota]], and Gar worked on boats from an early age. In 1911, at age 31, he invented a [[hydraulic]] lift for unloading coal from rail trucks.

==Garwood Industries==
He established the Wood Hoist Co. in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], and soon became a successful businessman. Later, he changed the company's name to Garwood Industries, which built racing and pleasure boats under the "Gar Wood" brand, but also capitalized on experience with coal unloaders to successfully produce and market '''GarWood''' truck, bus and coach bodies. He had a home in [[Algonac, Michigan]], the same city as Christopher Smith, founder of [[Chris-Craft]] boats.

==Racing career==
In 1916, Wood purchased a motorboat for racing called ''Miss Detroit''. Wood set a new [[water speed record]] of {{convert|74.870|mph|kph}} in 1920 on the [[Detroit River]], using a new boat called ''Miss America''. In the following twelve years, Wood built nine more ''Miss Americas'' and broke the record five times, raising it to {{convert|124.860|mph|kph}} in 1932 on the [[St. Clair River]].

In 1921, Wood raced one of his boats against the Havana Special train, {{convert|1250|mi|km}} up the [[Atlantic]] coast from [[Miami]] to [[New York City]]. Wood made the trip in 47 hours and 23 minutes and beat the train by 12 minutes. In 1925, he raced the [[Twentieth Century Limited]] train up the [[Hudson River]] between [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and New York and won by 22 minutes.

As well as being a record breaker and showman, Wood won five straight powerboat [[Gold Cup (motorsport)|Gold Cup]] races between 1917 and 1921. Wood also won the prestigious [[Harmsworth Trophy]] nine times (1920â21, 1926, 1928â30, 1932â33).

In 1931, he lost the Trophy in dramatic circumstances to his younger brother George. The race was held on the Detroit River and was billed as a match race between the Wood brothers and English (sic) racing driver and record-breaker [[Kaye Don]], driving ''[[Miss England II]]''. Before an estimated crowd of over a million spectators (one of the largest crowds for a sporting event ever), Don won the first heat of the race. In the second heat, Wood was leading Don, when ''Miss England II'' suddenly flipped over rounding one of the turns, fortunately without injury to Don and his co-driver. Gar Wood finished the race first, but both he and Don were disqualified because they had jumped the starter's gun by seven seconds. George Wood completed the final race to win the trophy.

In April, 1936, Wood, along with many other sports champions and stand outs, was honored at a banquet in [[Detroit, MI]].&lt;ref name=Star&gt;{{cite news| title=Sport Gossip| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Qg8_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jk4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6215%2C5649943| last=Degeer| first=Vern| work=[[Windsor Star|Windsor Daily Star]]| date=20 April 1936| accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This banquet was the first celebration of [[Champions Day]].

In July, 1936, a plaque was presented to Detroit from the White House honoring Detroit as the City of Champions.&lt;ref name=TC&gt;{{cite news| title=City of Champions Night at Fairgrounds| url=https://newspaperarchive.com/traverse-city-record-eagle/1936-06-29/page-26| work=[[Traverse City Record-Eagle]]| date=29 June 1936| page=26| accessdate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaque has five "medallions" featuring athletes. One of these medallions is of a power boat racer, representing Wood.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;{{cite news| title=Louis' Name Is Stricken From Champions' Plaque| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RUQbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Nk4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4049,3081736&amp;dq=city+of+champions+plaque&amp;hl=en| work=[[Pittsburgh Press|The Pittsburgh Press]]| agency=[[United Press International|The United Press]]| date=21 June 1936| accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later business career==
Wood retired from racing in 1933 to concentrate on his businesses. Garwood Industries continued to build wooden racing and pleasure boats until 1947 under the "Gar Wood" brand. Boats were sized between 16ft and 33ft in length; the most famous models were the 16ft [[Gar Wood Speedster]] (built from 1934 to 1938) and the exclusive 33â Baby Gar gentlemanâs racer (built in the 1920s and early 1930s).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.garwood.com/index.php/gar-wood-history/&lt;/ref&gt; Garwood Industries also built truck bodies and winches that were used extensively by truck manufacturers such as [[International Harvester]], and were an [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] supplier to both the civilian and military market.  Many trucks built during [[World War II]] came equipped with Garwood bodies and winches.  One of the biggest contributions by Garwood Industries was the development of the now-ubiquitous [[garbage truck]], which was originally built and sold under the name [[Garwood Load Packer]].

==Inventions==
Wood was known as an inventive genius who, at one point, held more US [[patents]] than any other living American.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

In 1897, at age 17, he invented a downdraft [[carburetor]] which enabled his inspection boat to outrace the other inspectors.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

In 1911 or 1912 he invented the profitable hydraulic hoist for dump trucks. He used the money It earned to build racing boats which won many championships between 1917 and 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLIJ4zw9370C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22Garfield+wood%22 |title=The World's Fastest Boats |page=30 |website=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point he had a job selling lightning rods to farmers, and to demonstrate their effectiveness he invented an [[induction coil]] device to mimic lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |quote=He sold lightning rods to farmers. He invented an induction-coil device to demonstrate their effectiveness |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FtUXAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Garfield+wood+lightning+rod |title=Popular Mechanics |volume=128 |publisher=Popular Mechanics Company |series=[[Industrial arts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and later years==
In the 1950s, Wood acquired [[Fisher Island (Florida)|Fisher Island]] in South [[Florida]]'s [[Biscayne Bay]], the last of a series of millionaires to occupy it as a one-family island retreat.  He sold it to a development group in 1963. Wood also had a summer retreat in McGregor Bay, Ontario.

A 1967 Popular Mechanics article &lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; showed even in retirement Wood was still active inventing an Electric Vehicle (EV) controller, which he used in the EV he built.

Wood died in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] 16 Jun 1971, at age 90 and days before the 50th anniversary of his first Harmsworth win. Upon his death, George Van of [[The Detroit News]] wrote: ''âTo the public, he was [[Tom Swift]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Frank Merriwell]] with a little bit of [[Horatio Alger]] thrown in.â''&lt;ref name=News&gt;{{cite news |title=Gar Wood â Speedboat King |url=http://www.thunderboats.org/history/history0511.html |first1=Vivian M. |last1=Baulch |first2=Pam |last2=Shermeyer |work=The Detroit News |date=18 February 1996 |publisher=The Hydroplane &amp; Raceboat Museum |accessdate=2014-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831004822/http://www.thunderboats.org/history/history0511.html |archivedate=2012-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wood was buried near his home in Algonac, Michigan.

==Award==
He was inducted in the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 1990.

{{Politics of China |expanded = Law }}

The '''''General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China''''' ([[Chinese character|Chinese]]: ä¸­åäººæ°å±åå½æ°æ³éå) is a law in the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] that was promulgated in 1986  and came into force on January 1, 1987.  It is intended to create a consistent framework for civil law interpretation in the People's Republic of China and is heavily influenced by the [[German Civil Code]].  Unlike most [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, the PRC does not have a comprehensive [[civil code]], and attempts to create one have proven difficult and controversial.

It is the most important codification after the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]]. It is significantly different from the French and German civil codes. It consists of 9 chapters and 156 articles.
The chapters deal with the following topics:

*'''Chapter 1''': Consists of the basic principles of civil activities like equality of parties in civil proceedings, voluntariness and honesty, protection of civil rights and lawful interests of legal persons, respect for social justice, public interest, state economic policies, etc. The general rules of the 1st chapter stipulate that the civil law of China regulates property and personal relationships among citizens and legal persons;

*'''Chapter 2''': Deals with legal capacity of natural persons;

*'''Chapter 3''': Deals with legal persons;

*'''Chapter 4''': Deals with legal acts and power of attorney;

* '''Chapter 5''': Deals with state, collective and individual ownership;

*'''Chapter 6''': Deals with remedies for breach of contract and torts;

*'''Chapter 7''': Deals with general provisions like limitations;

*'''Chapter 8''': Contains provisions for private international law;

*'''Chapter 9''': Contains supplementary and closing provisions;

== Curiosity ==
It is the first systematic legislation after the foundation of the PRC.

'''''Hemiscyllium halmahera''''', or the '''Halmahera epaulette shark''', is a species of [[bamboo shark]] from [[Indonesia]]. This species is described from two specimens collected near [[Ternate]] island in 2013, off the coast of larger [[Halmahera]] island. This species is  most similar to ''[[Hemiscyllium galei]]'', found in [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]], but looks strikingly different in its pattern of spots. While ''H. galei'' has seven large, dark spots on each side of its body, ''H. halmahera'' has a brown color with clusters of brown or white spots in [[polygon]] configurations all over its body.&lt;ref name=Allen2013/&gt; These small sharks are like other bamboo sharks, in that they use their [[pectoral fins]] to "walk" along the ocean floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.sci-news.com/biology/science-hemiscyllium-halmahera-new-species-walking-shark-indonesia-01335.html |title=''Hemiscyllium halmahera'': New Species of âWalkingâ Shark from Indonesia |work=sci-news.com |date=August 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Honorary Medal for Merits toward Museum Collections''' ({{lang-nl|Erepenning voor Verdiensten jegens Openbare Verzamelingen}}), also known as the '''Museum Medal''' ({{lang-nl|Museummedaille}}), is one of the oldest [[civil decoration]]s of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]. It was created by royal decree on 26 June 1817 by [[King William I of the Netherlands]]. The decree describes the following: "Erepenning voor blijken van belangstelling in 's Rijksverzamelingen door schenking betoond" ({{lang-en|an honorary medal  for appearance of interest in the state collection by donation shown}}). The medal is awarded in gold, silver or bronze as a token of appreciation to those who "aan hen, die enig boek- of kunstwerk, dat de vrucht van hun arbeid was, de Koning deden toekomen" ({{lang-en|for those, who donate to the Dutch monarch any works of art, that were collected with much effort}}).

By royal decree, on 5 May 1877, eligibility for this award was extended by [[King William III of the Netherlands]], with the description "aan hen, die door het aanbieden van belangrijke geschenken of op andere wijze zich verdienstelijk hebben gemaakt ten opzichte van de verschillende wetenschappelijke en kunstverzamelingen des Rijks" ({{lang-en|to those who donated important works of art to the state museums or who showed praiseworthy acts regarding the different scientific collections or art collection of the state museums}}). Due to this description, the medal obtained its current official name. However, since the end of the 19th century, this decoration is primarily known as the "Museum Medal". Up until 1897, the honorary medal was only a standing decoration, when [[Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] declared that the medal could be worn suspended from a ribbon.

Eligibility for this award was once again extending, by Queen Wilhelmina, on 28 October 1919 with the description "verdiensten jegens gemeentelijke (openbare) verzamelingen" (English: merit towards community (public) collections). What was initially a medal for generous donors became now an official royal award for merit. [[Queen Juliana of the Netherlands]] decided by royal decree on 26 July 1952 that the shape of the medal and ribbon should be changed. The current ribbon is orange with two red lines descending down the middle. A ribbon bar is also given with the award, with a palm branch device in either gold or silver for recipients of the gold or silver versions of the medal, respectively. [[Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands]] later changed the composition of the medallion, and is now depicted on the obverse of the medal.

'''''HushÃ¥llsost''''' ("household cheese") is a brand made of [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[cattle|cows]]'-[[milk]] [[cheese]].  It is a semi-hard cheese, with small granular holes, and is made from whole milk, which gives it a 26 percent fat content. There is also a version with less fat labeled "17% fetthalt".  ''HushÃ¥llsost'' is produced in cylinders weighing {{convert|1|to|2|kg|abbr=on}} each, which are today wrapped in plastic film before being aged around 60 days on average. The taste is described as mild yet somewhat sour. The cheese was traditionally produced on farms; the name ''hushÃ¥llsost'' is found in print at least as early as 1898. It is closely related to [[Port-Salut cheese]].

Consumed at a rate of 15 thousand tonnes a year, ''hushÃ¥llsost'' is the most popular cheese in Sweden.&lt;ref name="svmjolk"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.svenskmjolk.se/Mjolk-smor-och-ost/Vara-varumarken/Hushallsost--var-mest-kopta-ost/ | title=HushÃ¥llsost â vÃ¥r mest kÃ¶pta ost | accessdate=2011-02-11 | author=Larsson, Joakim | work=Svensk mjÃ¶lk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has [[Protected designation of origin|TSG]] Status.&lt;ref name="DOOREU"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/door/registeredName.html?denominationId=353 EU Profile - HushÃ¥llsost] (accessed 07/06/2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''INTELSAT 34''' or '''IS-34''' is [[communications satellite]] built on [[Space Systems/Loral]]'s [[SSL 1300|1300-series]] satellite platform. The satellite broadcasts television to homes in Brazil, distributes video programming for companies like [[HBO]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] across Latin America, and beams [[Satellite Internet access|Internet broadband services]] to travelers aboard airplanes and ships crossing the North Atlantic Ocean.

Intelsat 34, unlike its predecessor, does not include the UHF-band that Intelsat had been unable to sell to its intended customer, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]].

== Launch ==
Intelsat 34 is the 50th Loral-built satellite launched for Intelsat. With a launch mass of 7,275 pounds - about 3.3 metric tons - Intelsat 34 is a replacement for the [[Intelsat 27]] spacecraft lost aboard a [[Sea Launch]] mission in 2013. It took over service from the Galaxy 11 and Intelsat 805 spacecraft in orbit, the company's last two relay stations that had been launched before 2000.

The '''International Civil Defence Organisation''' (ICDO) is an intergovernmental organisation with the objective to contribute to the development by States of structures ensuring the protection and assistance of population and safeguarding property and the environment from natural or man-made disasters. The International Civil Defence Organization was founded in 1931. It has 57 [[member state]]s, 18 observer states and 23 affiliated members.

== History ==
The origin of ICDO dates back to 1931. It was in Paris that the French Surgeon-General George Saint-Paul founded the Association of ''Geneva Zones'', from which the present International Civil Defence Organisation originated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crisis-response.com/about/author.php?num=29 Crisis Response Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Iranun''' are a [[Moro people|Moro]] [[ethnic group]] native to [[Mindanao]], [[Philippines]], and the west coast of [[Sabah]] (in which they are found in 25 villages around the [[Kota Belud]] and [[Lahad Datu]] districts; also in [[Kudat]] and [[Likas]], [[Kota Kinabalu]]).   

[[File:Iranun House.JPG|thumb|left|The rehabilitation of a traditional Iranun house in the Heritage Village of [[Kota Kinabalu]], [[Sabah]].]]

For centuries, the Iranun were involved in [[pirate]]-related occupations in the Malay world. '''Lanun''' means pirate in [[Malay language]]. Originally from the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]], in southern Mindanao, Iranun colonies spread throughout Mindanao, the [[Sulu Archipelago]] and the north and east coast of Borneo. Most Iranuns are [[Muslim]]. Their language is part of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family, and is most closely related to the [[Maranao people]] of [[Lanao (province)|Lanao]]. Historically, the Iranun were given the exonym '''Illanun''' during the British colonial era. The Malay term ''Lanun'' or pirate originated from the exonym.

In the case of inter-marriages of an Iranun woman and an outsider man, the cultural influences of the woman's family will be more dominant that the outsider man would be considered as an Iranun man; although in a lot cases this does not happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bandira Datu Alang|title=Iranun: sejarah dan adat tradisi|year=1992|publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia|isbn=98-362-2600-1|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of the [[Maranao language|Maranao]] and [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanao]] is strongly rooted in the Iranun tongue. The Iranun may perhaps be the mother language and the rest are just a mere dialects. For several centuries, the Iranuns in the Philippines formed part of the Sultanate of Maguindanao. In the past, the seat of the Maguindanao Sultanate was situated at [[Lamitan]] and [[Malabang, Lanao del Sur|Malabang]]. Both of which were the strongholds of the Iranun society. Iranuns fought the Western invaders under the flag of the Maguindanao Sultanate. They formed part of the Moro resistance against the USA occupation of the Philippines from 1899 to 1913.&lt;ref name="TCW"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth Hite &amp; Kennon Bauman|title=The Cthulhu Wars: The United Statesâ Battles Against the Mythos|year=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=14-728-0789-8|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranun were excellent in maritime activity as they are traditionally sailors and pirates.&lt;ref name="TCW"/&gt; They used to ply the route connecting the [[Sulu Sea]], [[Moro Gulf]] to [[Celebes Sea]], and raided the Spanish held territories along the way.

'''''Karnak CafÃ©''''' (''Al-Karnak'', [[Arabic]]: Ø§ÙÙØ±ÙÙ) is a [[novella]] written in 1974 by [[Egypt]]ian writer [[Naguib Mahfouz]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1988. The novel was made into a [[Karnak (film)|film of the same name]] in 1975. Set against the discussions between the patrons of a cafÃ© in [[Cairo]], the ''Karnak CafÃ©'', the book follows the stories of three individuals during the 1960s, including the [[Six-Day War]] (1967) and the [[War of Attrition]] (1967â70). It therein explores some of the political currents vying for control over Egyptian politics in the 1960s as well as political persecution, the deep state, and state violence.

== Plot summary ==
The narrator begins the story by describing how he originally discovered the ''Karnak CafÃ©'' in Cairo, attracted by the quiet charms of Qurunfula, a bellydancer of former fame and the cafÃ©'s owner. There, the narrator quickly becomes part of the cafÃ©'s regular crowd of patrons, which represent a cross-section of Egyptian society during the early 1960s. Among many others, the crowd includes the following young people: Hilmi Hamada, an idealistic [[communist]] with whom Qurunfula has a discreet love affair; Isma'il al-Shaykh, a law graduate of modest origins; and Zaynab Diyab, another graduate from a poor background. Throughout the story, the youth are repeatedly arrested and imprisoned for prolonged periods; a mirror to Qurunfula's despair, the narrator keeps track how the youths' initial political enthusiasm and optimism slowly gives place to disillusion and hopelessness. After their third prison term, the cafÃ© learns that Hilmi Hamada has died in prison, leaving Qurunfula distraught. As Isma'il and Zaynab open up to the narrator, he learns of the horrors Isma'il and Zaynab endured in prison â Isma'il is repeatedly tortured while Zaynab is raped â and how the ruthless and brutal police officer Khalid Sawfan turned both Isma'il and Zaynab into informants for the secret police after their second term in prison. As Hilmi tries to convince Isma'il and Zaynab of the necessity of communism, he is betrayed by Zaynab, who tries to thereby keep Isma'il safe, and is beaten to death in prison. The defeat of the Egyptian army during the [[Six-Day War]] sees Isma'il, who was imprisoned in spite of Zaynab's assistance, and a reversal of fortunes: after being thrown into prison and having become disabled through torture, Sawfan joins the regular crowd of the Karnak CafÃ©, painting himself both as a criminal and a victim and gaining the patrons' appreciation through witty political commentary. The novel ends on a hopeful note with Qurunfula setting her eyes upon Munir Ahmad, a new idealistic and innocent youth: for purity and innocence never disappear forever.

'''Klaas Afrikaner''' ([[Khoekhoe language|Nama]] name: '''ÇGaruhamab''', born before 1760, died after 1800) was the second Captain of the [[Oorlam (ethnic group)|Orlam]] Afrikaners, first in the [[Cape Colony]], then in [[South-West Africa]]. Klaas became leader of his tribe after his father [[Oude Ram Afrikaner|Oude Ram]] died in [[Cape Town]] at around 1760. 

Under his leadership the Afrikaner Clan left the Cape in the 1770s and moved northwards into the area that is today southern [[Namibia]]. This happened at first with the consent, possibly even under the order, of the South African Cape Government. Later he is credited as one of the founders of Namibia's first systematic settlement in an engineering sense, [[ÇKhauxaÇnas]]. This settlement was built as a hidden retreat and a fortress to fend off possible pursuits by the Cape authorities, indicating that by then he had lost whatever mandate he might have had to execute military actions in South-West Africa. At around 1800 he handed over the [[chieftain]]ship to his son [[Jager Afrikaner]].&lt;ref name="Dierks"&gt;{{cite web

'''The Brigade of Abu al-Fadl al-Abbas''' ([[Arabic]]:ÙÙØ§Ø¡ Ø£Ø¨Ù Ø§ÙÙØ¶Ù Ø§ÙØ¹Ø¨Ø§Ø³, ''Liwa Abu al-Fadl al-Abbas''), also known as the '''al-Abbas Brigade''' ([[Arabic]]:ÙØªØ§Ø¦Ø¨ Ø§ÙØ¹Ø¨Ø§Ø³, ''Kata'ib al-Abbas''), is a pro-government [[Twelver]] [[Shia Muslim]] militant group operating throughout [[Syria]]. It is named after the nickname of [[Al-Abbas ibn Ali]], son of [[Imam Ali]].

In May and June 2013, Reuters reported a split had developed within the brigade over finances and leadership which erupted into a gunbattle.

On 19 May 2014, fighters from the [[Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki|Nour al-Din al-Zanki Brigade]] claimed to have taken over the al-Abbas Brigade's regional headquarters in Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5N7p38Xpjs |title=#Ø­Ø±ÙØ©_ÙÙØ±_Ø§ÙØ¯ÙÙ_Ø§ÙØ²ÙÙÙ -- Ø§ÙØ³ÙØ·Ø±Ø© Ø¹ÙÙ ØºØ±ÙØ© Ø¹ÙÙÙØ§Øª Ø§Ø¨Ù Ø§ÙÙØ¶Ù Ø§ÙØ¹Ø¨Ø§Ø³ ÙÙ Ø­Ù Ø§ÙØ±Ø§Ø´Ø¯ÙÙ|date=19 May 2014|work=YouTube|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Liberal Party''' ({{lang-ro|Partidul NaÈional Liberal}}, '''PNL''') is an active non-parliamentary [[political party]] in the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]]. It was founded in 1993, but temporarily disappeared through [[merger (politics)|political amalgamation]] in 2000, before being refounded in 2006. 

It is not officially recognized by of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party of Romania]], therefore it does not have the right to share the historical tradition of the [[Greater Romania|prewar]] party of the same name which was forcibly dissolved in 1947 in [[Socialist Republic of Romania|post-war Romania]] by the [[Romanian Communist Party]] after the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|reannexation of Bessarabia]].

== Political agenda ==

The party supports the [[Unification of Romania and Moldova|unification of the Republic of Moldova with Romania]] and shares copies the identity and ideology of the traditional party in neighbouring Romania. Nonetheless, very much unlike the Romanian PNL (which is dominant on the centre-right as well as [[List of political parties in Romania|Romania's second largest political party]]), the Moldovan PNL might actually be considered a [[Minor party|micro party]] with respect to [[Politics of Moldova|Moldovan politics]]. In addition to support for [[political union]] with Romania, as an interim measure, the PNL supports [[Moldova and the European Union|EU]] and [[Moldova and NATO|NATO]] membership for Moldova.

The '''National Police Chiefs' Council''' ('''NPCC''') is a national coordination body for [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|law enforcement in the United Kingdom]] and the representative body for British police chief officers. Established on 1 April 2015, it replaced the former [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] (ACPO), following the [[Association of Chief Police Officers#Parker Review|Parker Review]] of the operations of ACPO.

== History == 

The NPCC was established on 1 April 2015 as the replacement organisation of the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]].

In 2010, the [[First Cameron ministry|Cameron Government]] announced a series of police reforms including local accountability through [[Police and Crime Commissioners]], and the creation of the [[National Crime Agency]] and the [[College of Policing]]. In 2013, the PCCs commissioned General Sir [[Nick Parker]] to review the services that ACPO provided and make recommendations about the requirements of a national policing body following the fundamental changes in policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24945596|title= Acpo overhaul needed, says general's report for PCCs|publisher=BBC News|date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a group of chief officers and PCCs began working together to implement Parker's recommendations and develop a national body. Chief officers voted in support of the group's proposals in July 2014. Chief Constable Sara Thornton was appointed to chair the NPCC on 2 December 2014. ACPO was closed down on 31 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apccs.police.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Independent-review-of-ACPO.pdf|title=Independent review of ACPO|author=Nick Parker|date=2013|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018 the NPCC threatened to take legal action in the high court against the government's plans to cut hundreds of millions of pounds from police funding.  The Treasury plans to increase the money each force pays to the police pension scheme. This would involve forces paying a Â£420m bill, as well as the 19% cut to police funding since 2010.  Police chiefs maintain reductions have make it hard for fores to protect the public. Leaders of three of the biggest forces fear officer levels will drop to those of the 1970s.  The NPCC fears if the Â£420m bill is dealt with only by cutting police numbers, this will mean 10,000 fewer officers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/30/police-threaten-tories-with-legal-action-over-forces-budget-cuts Police to sue government unless it backs down over cuts] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and membership ==
The NPCC is founded by a legal agreement between chief constables, [[Police and Crime Commissioners]], and non-Home Office police force equivalents under Section 22A of the [[Police Act 1996]]. It is hosted by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] (MPS) but acts independently.&lt;ref name=NPCA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npcc.police.uk/documents/NPCC%20Section%2022a%20Agreement.pdf|title=National Police Collaboration Agreement â in relation to the setting up of a Co-ordinating Body known as the National Police Chiefsâ Council ("NPCC")|publisher=National Police Chiefs' Council|author=Eversheds LLP|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/business-begins-at-the-national-police-chiefs-council|title=Business begins at the National Police Chiefsâ Council|date=1 April 2015|publisher=National Police Chiefs' Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=June 2018}}

The NPCC brings together and is funded by police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as the armed services and some British overseas territories. It draws on the efforts and expertise of chief officers: those ranked Assistant Chief Constable and above, or Commander and above in MPS and [[City of London Police]], and senior police staff equivalents. It coordinates police forces'  collective operational responses to national threats such as terrorism, organised crime and national emergencies.

The current chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council is [[Sara Thornton (police officer)|Sara Thornton]], [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Queen's Police Medal|QPM]], formerly Chief Constable of the [[Thames Valley Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30277356|title=Sara Thornton to lead National Police Chiefs' Council|date=1 December 2014|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Constable of [[Sussex Police]] Giles York and MPS Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt support her as Vice-chairs in addition to their day jobs as chief officers within forces.

=== Chief Constables' Council ===
The Chief Constables' Council is the senior operational decision-making body for the National Police Chiefs' Council. Every police force is represented in the work of the NPCC through the Chief Constables' Council.

The Chief Constablesâ Council is the primary decision-making forum for the NPCC. Chief constables (and equivalents) meet quarterly to discuss operational policing issues and agree action. Working with the College of Policing, the council takes decisions on national standards and common approaches with the aim of protecting the public from the most serious and strategic threats.

===Coordination committees===
In addition to their day jobs, chief officers support the NPCC's work by providing national operational perspectives on particular crime and policing issues. There are eleven broad coordination committees, each led by a chief officer. Within each area, chief officers may also lead on specific issues - for example, under the Crime Operations Coordination Committee there are individual leads for domestic abuse, rape, drugs and cyber-crime. The coordination committees cover:

* Crime Operations
* Criminal Justice
* Equality, Diversity and Human Rights
* Finance
* Information Management
* International Coordination
* Local Policing 
* Operations
* Performance Management
* Workforce
* Counter terrorism (chaired by [[Metropolitan Police Service]] Assistant Commissioner and responsible for the [[National Counter Terrorism Policing Network]])

Coordination committees work closely with the [[College of Policing]] to assist in the development of professional practice for police officers in different areas of policing. Representatives from the Government and other stakeholders in the criminal justice system and third sector are involved in the committeesâ work to include a range of perspectives.

== Projects ==
The NPCC operates and/or collaborates with the following police projects:

* [[ACRO Criminal Records Office]] (ACRO)
* [[AVCIS Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service]] (AVCIS)
* [[National Ballistics Intelligence Service]] (NABIS)
* [[National Domestic Extremism and Disorder Intelligence Unit]] (NDEDIU)
* [[National Police Coordination Centre]] (NPoCC)
* [[National Police Freedom of Information and Data Protection Unit]] (NPFDU)
* [[National Wildlife Crime Unit]] (NWCU)
* [[Secured by Design]]
* [[UK National Counter Terrorism Policing HQ]] (NCTP HQ)

According to [[Felix Kanitz]], because the melody was played by the [[Ottoman military]] [[orchestra]]s when the Ottomans left [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] in May 1867, this melody became one of the most favorite Serb melodies.&lt;ref name="DamjanoviÄTomiÄ2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=DamjanoviÄ|first1=Ratomir Rale|last2=TomiÄ|first2=Novo|last3=ÄosiÄ|first3=Sanja|title=Serbia--srpski narod, srpska zemlja, srpska duhovnost u delima stranih autora : pesme i poeme, pripovetke, romani, drame, putopisi, besede, dnevnici, memoari, eseji, pisma, zapisi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lnItAQAAIAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Itaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zbornik Istorijskog muzeja Srbije|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlxpAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Muzej|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; This melody was regularly played by [[Armed forces of the Principality of Serbia|Serbian military]] orchestras during [[World War I]] and was part of an emotional reception of the victory of Serbian army on the [[Macedonian Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|JergoviÄ|2004|p=577}}: "Nizamski rastanak, melodija koju su svirali orkestri srpske kraljevske vojske za Prvoga svjetskog rata, i bila je dio solunaÅ¡koga emocionalnog kataloga."&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, this song became part of the repertoire of Serb [[romanticist]]s and [[Serbian nationalism|nationalists]] and was regularly sung during their gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|JergoviÄ|2004|p=577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[Benjamin IsoviÄ]] used the melody of "Nizamski rastanak" to write the Bosniak song "Å ehidski rastanak", believing that he was only bringing back this melody to its Bosnian birth place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|JergoviÄ|2004|p=577}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miljenko JergoviÄ]] considers the Bosnian origin of the melody as completely uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|JergoviÄ|2004|p=577}}: ".... istina sasvim neizvesnoj, postojbini.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skupite se svi, dobri drugovi
neka truba dok ne padne mrak, svira rastanak.
Poslednju naÅ¡u pesmu vojniÄku
zapevajmo sloÅ¾no svi nek' se sve ori.
 
Pa za one proÅ¡le dane, nek' ti neka suza kane
pa zar nismo bili mi, dobri drugovi.
Ko da Å¾ali noÄi, ko da Å¾ali dane
rastanak se sprema a vremena nema
oj, druÅ¾e moj.
 
JoÅ¡ u srcu mom kao teÅ¡ki zvon
odjekuje tuÅ¾ne trube glas, kroz taj garnizon.
Poslednji, tuÅ¾ni pozdrav vojniÄki
zapevajmo sloÅ¾no svi nek' se sve ori.

Neka svaka cura Äuje Å¡ta joj vojnik poruÄuje
sad kad sluÅ¾ba prestaje, kad se rastaje.
Ludo Å¾ivim sada, Äudna tuga vlada
uspomena davna iz vojniÄkih dana,
oj, druÅ¾e moj.

may the trumpet play until night sets, signalling our departure.
Our last soldierâs song

Well for those old days, you can let out a tear
were we not good friends.
Who yearns for the nights, who yearns for the days
the departure is preparing but there is no time
oh, good friend.

Still in my heart, like a hardened bell
are heard the sounds of a sad trumpet, through that garrison.
The last, sad soldierâs greeting
letâs all sing, may it be heard.

May every girl hear what a soldier recommends to her
now when the service ends, when we all depart.
I live madly now, a strange sadness is present
a distant memory from my soldierâs days,
oh, good friend.

'''Psalter World Map''' is the name historiography gave to a medieval world map that has been found in a [[psalter]]. This ''[[mappa mundi]]'' is now conserved at the [[British Library]] in London.

The small map (c. {{convert|9.5|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} high) shows a lot of detail. It was written around 1260; the author is unknown. According to historian Anna-Dorothee von den Brincken, it looks like a small version of the [[Ebstorf Map]] from Northern Germany.

It is a typical ''mappa mundi'' that does not only show the geographical and historical knowledge, but also puts it into the frame of [[salvation]] history. Jesus Christ appears in the East (i.e. "above"), as the maps of Christian [[Middle Ages]] have East above, not North, giving a blessing with his right hand.

An open-access high-resolution digital image of the map with place and name annotations is included among the thirteen medieval maps of the world edited in the [[Virtual Mappa]] project.

'''Qalet Marku Redoubt''' ({{lang-mt|Ridott ta' Qalet Marku}}) was a [[redoubt]] in the limits of [[Naxxar]], [[Malta]]. It was built in 1715â1716 by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zammit|first1=Vincent|title=The Order's 18th Century Fortifications|journal=Civilization|date=1984|volume=1|page=170|publisher=PEG Ltd|location=[[Ä¦amrun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was demolished to make way for the coast road, but its remains are possibly still buried under the road.&lt;ref name=orbeau&gt;{{cite news|title=Lost landmarks of Malta: Batteria DâOrbeau - Qalet Marku, BaÄ§ar iÄ-Äaghaq|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-02-23/arts-and-culture/lost-landmarks-of-malta-batteria-dorbeau-qalet-marku-bahar-ic-caghaq-4033118209/|accessdate=26 June 2015|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Qalet Marku Redoubt was built in 1715â1716 as part of the first building programme of redoubts in Malta. The nearest fortifications to the redoubt were [[GÄ§allis Battery]] to the northwest and [[Qalet Marku Battery]] to the east. Both of these batteries are now largely destroyed, but some remains still survive.

The redoubt originally consisted of a pentagonal platform with a low parapet. A rectangular [[blockhouse]] was located at the centre of its gorge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=18th Century Hospitaller Coastal Batteries|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/18th-century-hospitaller-coastal-batteries.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=6 December 2015|date=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redoubt was demolished to make way for the [[BaÄ§ar iÄ-ÄagÄ§aq]]â[[Salina, Malta|Salina]] coast road.&lt;ref name=orbeau/&gt; Its remains are probably still buried under the surface of the road. Part of the structure can still be seen protruding from beneath the road, although it is encased in concrete.

From June 2013 to his appointment as Deputy Director in January 2014, Ledgett headed the investigation of leaks regarding [[PRISM (surveillance program)|NSA surveillance programs]] made by [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/leadership/bio_ledgett.shtml |title=Biography Deputy Director of the NSA â NSA/CSS |publisher=NSA.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3, 2017, Ledgett announced that he would be retiring in the spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geller|first1=Eric|title=NSA deputy director resigning this spring|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/nsa-deputy-director-resigning-richard-leggett-234636|work=Politico|date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor was [[George C.

On August 15, 2017, Ledgett was elected to [[M&amp;T Bank]] Corporation's Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/36270/000119312517258579/d443507dex991.htm|title=EX-99.1|website=www.sec.gov|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statements regarding NSA surveillance==
Ledgett pledged increased transparency regarding NSA operations. However, he defended the operations of the NSA and argued in a rare interview with [[Reuters]] that NSA operations are completely legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zakaria |first=Tabassum |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/13/us-usa-security-nsa-idUSBRE9BC0YZ20131213 |title=Exclusive: After 'cataclysmic' Snowden affair, NSA faces winds of change |publisher=Reuters |date=December 13, 2013 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ledgett also accused the media of sensationalizing reports about various NSA mass surveillance programs.&lt;ref name="Forbes 2014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bercovici |first=Jeff |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2014/03/20/at-ted-nsas-deputy-director-says-president-madison-wouldve-been-proud/ |title=At TED, NSA's Deputy Director Says 'President Madison Would've Been Proud' |work=Forbes |date=March 20, 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Ledgett stated during a [[TED Talk]] that the NSA operates legally. He further argued that President [[James Madison]] would be proud of the way in which Constitutional checks and balances have governed NSA mass surveillance.&lt;ref name="Forbes 2014" /&gt;

'''Turks in Liechtenstein''' ({{lang-de|TÃ¼rken in Liechtenstein}} {{lang-tr|LihtenÅtayn TÃ¼rkleri}}) consist of both [[Turkish people]] who live in [[Liechtenstein]] but were born elsewhere, as well as citizens of Liechtenstein with Turkish roots (meaning origins in [[Turkey]], the island of [[Cyprus]], or communities of the [[Turkish diaspora]]). Presently, 894 Turkish citizens live in Liechtenstein (this does not include Turks with Liechtensteinian nationality), accounting for 3% of the total population of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|FÃ¼rstentum Liechtenstein|2007|loc=6-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Turks are the fifth-largest group of foreigners in Liechtenstein, behind Swiss, Austrians, Italians, and Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|FÃ¼rstentum Liechtenstein|2007|loc=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, 296 Turkish citizens work in Liechtenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|FÃ¼rstentum Liechtenstein|2007|loc=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4601">In March 1972 [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party â Iraq Region|Ba'athist]] [[Iraq]] proposed [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] to re-establish the '''[[United Arab Republic]]''' which dissolved in 1971. The Iraqi proposal was an immediate reaction to [[Jordan]]'s proposal for a [[King Hussein's federation plan|United Arab Kingdom]] but collided with the already established [[Federation of Arab Republics]] and failed because of IraqiâSyrian differences.

== Union of Arab Republics ==
[[File:Union of Arab Republics 1972.png|thumb|The 1972 proposed ''Union of Arab Republics'' (red) was a new version of the 1971 failed ''United Arab Republic'']]
The [[King Hussein's federation plan|United Arab Kingdom]] plan was angrily rejected by the [[Palestinians]], the [[Arab League]] and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Islamic States]] as well as by [[Israel]]. The Iraqi counter-proposal urged to include the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]]&lt;ref&gt;Hassan Tawalba: ''The Ba'th and Palestine'', p. 55f. Dar al-Ma'mun, Bagdad 1982&lt;/ref&gt; (to fight united for the liberation of Palestine) in an ''Union of Arab Republics'' instead and invited all other "progressive" Arab states to join, too.&lt;ref name="Shibli"&gt;[[Shibli al-Aysami]]: ''Einheit, Freiheit, Sozialismus'', p. 99â102. Valle Olona, Varese 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ron"&gt;[[Robin Leonard Bidwell]]: ''Dictionary of Modern Arab History'', p. 429f. Routledge, New York 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Libya]], however, should be excluded - at least for the beginning. The Iraqi regime blamed Libya's Revolutionary leader [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] to sponsor Iraqi-Syrian conflicts while Gaddafi condemned the Iraqi regime for its approach to the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Iraqi Communist Party|Iraqi communists]].&lt;ref name="Shibli" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ITN"&gt;Reuters 27th March 1972: ''[http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist/RTV/1972/03/27/BGY508150465/?s= Iraqi Delegation Arrives In Cairo For Talks On A Tripartite Federation]'' (with [http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist/RTV/1972/03/27/BGY508150465/?s=#shotListTechnicalInformationAnchor VIDEO clip])&lt;/ref&gt;

End of March 1972 Iraqi vice president [[Saddam Hussein]] led a high-ranking delegation to [[Damascus]] and [[Cairo]] in order to promote the proposal. In Syria Saddam Hussein met president [[Hafez al-Assad]] and foreign minister [[Abdul Halim Khaddam]] but Egypt's president [[Anwar Sadat]] had already consulted Gaddafi in Libya. On 26 March Saddam Hussein met Egypt's vice president [[Mahmoud Fawzi]] in Cairo and on 28th he finally met Sadat in [[Alexandria]]. Referring to the already established Egyptian-Libyan-Syrian [[Federation of Arab Republics]] the proposal was rejected.&lt;ref name="Shibli" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ITN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Record of the Arab World: ''Yearbook of Arab and Israeli Politics'', vol. 1, p. 222. Research and Publishing House, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Syria and Egypt invited Iraq to join the federation instead. According to Khaddam as a first step to unite an Iraqi-Syrian summit should settle the quarrels between the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party â Syria Region|Syrian Baath-Party]] and the Iraqi Baath-Party. In October 1972 Iraq's president [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] agreed the Syrian conditions&lt;ref name="Shibli" /&gt; and proposed to create an Iraqi-Syrian union within the federation&lt;ref name="PAN"&gt;[[Polish Academy of Sciences|Polska Akademia Nauk]] - Komitet BadaÅ KrajÃ³w Azji, Afryki i Ameryki ÅaciÅskiej: ''Studies on the Developing Countries'', No. 1-4 (9-12), p. 180f. ZakÅad Narodowy im OssoliÅskich, Breslau 1989&lt;/ref&gt; - as well as Egypt and Libya had already announced to merge bilaterally in a closer union (also called ''United Arab Republic'') within the federation. Although further discussions were not held, in January 1973 the Iraqi regime assured Egypt and Syria its full military and economical support in case of a [[Yom Kippur War|new war against Israel]]. Iraq's offer to create a Joint Military Command was rejected however.&lt;ref name="Shibli" /&gt;
