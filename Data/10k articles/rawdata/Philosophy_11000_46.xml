''''Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi''' ({{lang-ar|عبد الرحمن الكواكبي}}{{lrm}}, 1854 or 1855–1902) was a [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian]] author and Pan-[[Arab]] solidarity supporter. He was one of the most prominent intellectuals of his time; however, his thoughts and writings continue to be relevant to the issues of Islamic identity and Pan-Arabism. His criticisms of the [[Ottoman Empire]] eventually led to Arabs calling for the sovereignty of the Arab Nations, setting the basis for Pan-Arab nationalism. Al-Kawakibi articulated his ideas in two influential books, Tabai al-Istibdad wa-Masari al-Isti’bad (The Nature of Despotism) and Umm Al-Qura (Mother of the village).  He died in 1902 of “mysterious” causes. His family alleged that he was poisoned by [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] agents.

==Early life==
Al-Kawakibi was born into a distinguished family in 1854 in [[Aleppo]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W4OKaz5dzdYC|title=Modernist Islam, 1840-1940: A Sourcebook|last=Kurzman|first=Charles|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195154689|page=152|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a thorough education in the Islamic sciences and the languages of the region including Arabic, Turkish and Persian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a young man, Al-Kawakibi was very interested in literature and politics, having edited Furat, the official paper of Aleppo from 1875-1880.  He also edited the highly influential reformist journal, al-Manar, which was started by Rashid Rida, another influential [[Islamic]] scholar.

==Career==
After working at Furat and al-Manar, Al-Kawakibi started his own literary journal called the al-Sahba.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/arabunity/2008/01/2008525184242106402.html|title=Profile: Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal vehemently criticized the despots and dictators of his time, and alluded to the tyranny of the Ottoman Empire. He especially focused his criticism on the new Vali of Aleppo, Jamil Pasha. Due to Al-Kawakibi’s political outspokenness, the journal was shut down by the local Ottoman Government after only 15 issues.  
After his work as editor, Al-Kawakibi entered politics more directly, and worked for various positions in the Ottoman civil service in Aleppo. Despite his opposition to the Ottoman Empire, Al-Kawakibi wanted to serve Arabs. During this point in his career, he became an honorary member of the board of lawyer examinations.  Al-Kawakibi, along with other Aleppans, complained about the Vali to the central government in [[Istanbul]]. These criticisms fell on deaf ears until Istanbul sent a representative to Aleppo to investigate, and immediately threw Kawakibi and his followers into prison for false complaints.  Once released from prison, Al-Kawakibi’s popularity rose and he became the mayor of Aleppo in 1892.
Later on Al-Kawakibi went to Istanbul to study the Ottoman Empire’s despotism and problematic leadership more extensively. With his newfound knowledge, he returned to Aleppo and began working for the Ottoman government again.  Because of his opinions, he was subject to harassment and intimidated on a regular basis. He decided to publish his book Umm al-Qura (The Mother of Cities:Mecca) in Egypt, rather than in [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]], and finally left his home country in 1899, moving to [[Egypt]] where he was welcomed by other Islamic intellectuals residing there.

==Influences==
Al-Kawakibi was influenced by the teachings of [[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]] as well his disciple [[Muhammad Abduh]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Al-Afghani preached Pan-Islamic identity – with this as his basis, Al-Kawakibi went one step further, incorporating Al-Afghani’s theories into Pan-Islamic Arabic solidarity. Another one of Al-Kawakibi’s contemporaries was the Salafiya thinker, [[Rashid Rida]] who lived in Egypt at the same time.  Rida and Al-Kawakibi discussed ideas of Islamism and Pan-Arabism as well as Quranic interpretations. Al-Kawakibi believed that Arabs should be representatives of Islam, not the Ottomans. Rida believed that imitations ([[taqlid]]) was the reason for downfall of Islam and Muslims. They both believed in the resurgence of independent thinking ([[ijtihad]]).  Al-Kawakibi also struck a friendship with Sheikh Ali Yussuf, the editor of Al-Muayyad, a well-known paper in Egypt. 
Thanks to his earlier education, Al-Kawakibi was heavily influenced by Western thoughts and ideals as well. Al-Kawakibi believed that Europeans were helped to advance in civilization by embracing modernity, while the Arabs and Muslims languished in the darkness.

==Ideas==
Al-Kawakibi, in his earlier writings, was careful not to specifically criticize the Ottoman rulers, but rather critiqued despots and imperialists in general, though his implied target was clear. In one of his books Tabai al-Istibdad wa-Masari al-Isti’bad (The Nature of Despotism), he discusses the idea of tyranny and rejects it. Al-Kawakibi believed that the demise of the Muslims in the Arab world was due to the rule of the Ottoman Empire. He was particularly a vocal opponent of the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and believed that the Sultan had no right to control the Arab people. Al-Kawakibi said that, “If I had an army at my command I would overthrow Abdulhamid’s (Sultan of the Ottoman Empire) government in 24 hours”.  He also invoked Prophet Muhammad’s sayings in order to rally people behind his cause.  He also believed that the Arabs were united unlike other Muslims and that there was no racial or sectarian segregation among Arabs. He stated that Arabs were, “of all nations the most suitable to be an authority in religion and an example to the Muslims; the other nations have followed their guidance at the start and will not refuse to follow them now.”  
Al-Kawakibi believed that there were few reasons beyond the Ottoman’s influence for the decline of Muslims at the time period.  Imposition of Ottoman rules on everyone under their control only elevated the position of the Turks and kept the other Muslims, especially Arabs in the dark. He believed that religion was used as an excuse by the Ottomans to unfairly rule over Arabs and other Muslims without understanding the cultural and local customs. Al-Kawakibi also believed that imitation (taqlid) caused the Muslims to be stagnant when it came to their religion, and other forms of knowledge. Instead, of continuously trying to interpret the [[Quran]] and hadiths, Muslims relied on interpretations from centuries ago. Other reasons for the decline of Muslims were he believed, that Muslims abandoned Islamic values and relied on superstitions, and also that they disregarded science and, by extension, were not being able to keep up with modern society. 
Al-Kawakibi additionally believed that [[Mecca]] should be the capital of the Islamic world, not Istanbul. He was a proponent of historical Arab exceptionalism as the founding location of Islam. He believed that the rightful [[Caliph]] should come from the Quraysh tribe as Prophet Muhammad did. His book Umm Al Qura (The Mother of Villages) reflects these ideas. His book contained a fictional story of an Islamic conference taking place in Mecca, thus illustrating the importance of Mecca to the Islamic world.

==Criticism==
Al-Kawakibi’s ideas were controversial to some. His critics alleged that he was a proponent of socialism.  According to author Charles Tripp, the idea of “[[Islamic socialism]]” was advocated by Al-Kawakibi and [[Rashid Rida]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}  Islamic socialism is the belief that the Quran permits redistribution of wealth, although that point is disputed by many Muslim scholars.  Another common criticism was that Al-Kawakibi disregarded Islam as the focal point of one’s life and marginalized the religion because he believed that Caliphs should have no real political power, but be a spiritual guide. However, that criticism seems to have been unfounded, as Al-Kawakibi was, in writing and action, a very religious man.

==Legacy==
Although Al-Kawakibi did not have a tremendous amount of support during his lifetime, his message and legacy passed onto Pan-Arab nationalists such as [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], even though Al-Kawakibi was not a Pan-Arab nationalist but instead believed in Arab unity and solidarity. The founding of Islam in Arab land was a key reason for Al-Kawakibi to suggest the entire Muslim world to unite under the Arabs. Many Islamic and Arab reformists have also used Al-Kawakibi as an influence.

The Kawaakibi-foundation is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kawaakibi.org/#kawaakibi Who was Kawaakibi?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Al-Kawakibi died in 1902 and many of his family and supporters alleged that he had been poisoned by Turkish agents. However, this has never been proven.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

also to foster in a learning and research community the dialectics of interpretation, in which what is alien in the text of the other becomes the 
starting point for a process of questioning the horizons of our own prejudicial world in the hope of expanding and transforming them.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, A. and R. Coyne. ''Interpretation in Architecture: Design as a Way of Thinking'', Routledge 2006, p.164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Axel Honneth''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|n|ɪ|t|,_|-|ɛ|t}}; {{IPA-de|aksl̩ ˈhɔnɛt|lang}}; born July 18, 1949) is a professor of philosophy at both the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] and [[Columbia University]]. He is also director of the ''Institut für Sozialforschung'' ([[Institute for Social Research]]) in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]].

==Biography==
Honneth was born in [[Essen]], [[West Germany]] on July 18, 1949, studied in [[Bonn]], [[Bochum]], [[Berlin]] and [[Munich]] (under [[Jürgen Habermas]]), and taught at the [[Free University of Berlin]] and [[the New School]] before moving to the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University of Frankfurt in 1996. He also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Amsterdam]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uva.nl/en/disciplines/philosophy/home/components-centrecolumn/the-spinoza-chair.html uva.nl]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he became director of the Institute for Social Research, originally home to the so-called [[Frankfurt School]], at the University of Frankfurt. Since 2011, he is also Jack C. Weinstein Professor of the Humanities at the department of philosophy at [[Columbia University]] in the City of New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/axel-honneth Axel Honneth | Department of Philosophy - Columbia University]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Honneth's work focuses on social-political and moral philosophy, especially relations of power, recognition, and respect. One of his core arguments is for the priority of intersubjective relationships of recognition in understanding social relations. This includes non- and mis-recognition as a basis of social and interpersonal conflict. For instance, grievances regarding the distribution of goods in society are ultimately struggles for recognition.

His first main work ''The Critique of Power: Reflective Stages in a Critical Social Theory'' explores the affinities between the Frankfurt School and [[Michel Foucault]]. In his second main work ''The Struggle for Recognition: Moral Grammar of Social Conflicts'', the recognition concept is derived mainly from [[G.W.F. Hegel]]'s early social philosophical works, but is supplemented by [[George Herbert Mead]]'s social psychology, [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]]'  communicative ethics, and [[Donald Winnicott]]'s object relation theory. Honneth's critical adaptation of these is the basis of his critical social theory, which attempts to remedy the deficits of previous approaches. In 2003, Honneth co-authored ''Recognition or Redistribution?'' with feminist philosopher [[Nancy Fraser]], who criticizes the priority of ethical categories such as recognition over structural social-political categories such as redistribution in Honneth's thought. His recent work ''[[Reification (Marxism)|Reification]]'' reformulates this key "[[Western Marxism|Western Marxist]]" concept in terms of intersubjective relations of recognition and power. For Honneth, all forms of reification are due to intersubjectively based pathologies rather than the structural character of social systems such as [[capitalism]] as argued by [[Karl Marx]] and [[György Lukács]].

'''Bronisław Ferdynand Trentowski''' (21 January 1808 in [[Opole]] – 16 June 1869) was a [[Poland|Polish]] "[[Messianism#Polish|Messianist]]" philosopher, [[pedagogist]], journalist and [[Freemason]], and the chief representative of the Polish Messianist "national philosophy."&lt;ref name="Trentowski, Bronisław Ferdynand p. 483"&gt;"Trentowski, Bronisław Ferdynand," ''Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN'', vol. 4, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Bronisław Trentowski was an alumnus of the [[Piarist]] college in [[Łuków]]. In his youth, he taught school in [[Podlasie]], then fought as an [[Uhlan|ulan]] in the Polish [[November Uprising|November 1830–31 Uprising]].  After the uprising's suppression, he emigrated to Germany, eventually settling at [[Freiburg]] in [[Baden]]. He developed an interest in philosophy, became an assistant professor at [[Freiburg University]] and remained there to the end of his life.  He attempted to return to [[Poland]], but was expelled from [[Poznań]] in 1843 by the [[Prussia]]n government, and from [[Kraków]] in 1848 by the [[Austria]]n government.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'',  pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

He published his first work in 1837 in German, but from 1842 he wrote only in Polish, beginning with ''Chowanna, czyli system pedagogiki narodowej jako umiejętności wychowania, nauki i oświaty, słowem wykształcenia naszej młodzieży'' (''Chowanna'', or the System of National Pedagogy as the Science of Education and Instruction, in a Word, of Educating Our Youth).&lt;ref name="Zarys. p. 21"&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'',  p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trentowski, in his book ''Stosunek filozofii do cybernetyki, czyli sztuki rządzenia narodem'' (The Relation of Philosophy to [[Cybernetics#History|Cybernetics]], or the Art of Governing a Nation, 1843), was the first Polish-language author to use the term "[[Cybernetics#History|cybernetics]]."

In 1847–48 he wrote a book, ''Wiara słowiańska, czyli etyka piastująca wszechświat'' (The Slavic Faith, or the Ethics that Governs the Universe), demonstrating that the [[Slavic gods]] were a form of the same god that was worshipped by Christians.

From 1840 Trentowski wrote for ''Tygodnik Literacki'' (The Literary Weekly), ''Rok'' (The Year), ''Biblioteka Warszawska'' (The Warsaw Library) and ''Orędownik Naukowy'' (The Spokesman of Science).&lt;ref name="Trentowski, Bronisław Ferdynand p. 483" /&gt;

Trentowski preached the concept of a "national philosophy," i.e., a philosophy sprung from the peculiar characteristics of the Polish people that would serve that people in the accomplishment of its historic mission. Based on his philosophy, he created a pedagogical system that was intended to revive the Polish nation through education and an upbringing in a spirit of [[patriotism]] (a program of "national [[pedagogy]]"). In [[psychology]], he introduced the concept of an individual, singular "self" (''jaźń''); and he treated a society as a collection of "selves." In political philosophy, he postulated the reconciliation of [[reform]]s with national tradition.&lt;ref name="Trentowski, Bronisław Ferdynand p. 483" /&gt;

Trentowski had much in common with fellow Polish Messianist [[Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński]]. He had the same speculative mentality; the same [[maximalist]] aspirations in philosophy and conviction that "God had destined [him] for the complete reform of learning, and through it the rebirth of society."&lt;ref name="Zarys. p. 21"/&gt;

The chief object of his philosophy was universality, an emergence from one-sided solutions. One-sided to him were [[Philosophical realism|realism]] and [[idealism]], [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[Perspective (cognitive)|points of view]], [[experience]] and [[mind]], [[empirical]] and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[knowledge]]. He sought to go beyond these [[antithesis|antitheses]] to a [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]]. He judged Messianism severely and rejected any connection with German philosophy; in fact, however, he was taken with German [[Hegelianism]], and in his later writings also with the Messianist national ideology, and the union of these two elements constituted the fabric of his philosophy.&lt;ref name="Zarys. p. 21"/&gt;

'''Carlo Lottieri''' (born 6 November 1960, [[Brescia]]) is Professor of Political Philosophy at the [[University of Verona]]. He holds a bachelor's degree (summa cum laude) in Philosophy from the [[University of Genoa]], a M.A. from the ''Institut Universitaire d’Etudes Européens'' (now attached to the [[University of Geneva]]), a M.A. and a Ph.D. from the [[Paris-Sorbonne University]]. His research interests cover Philosophy of Law, Federalism,  Libertarianism, Political Theology, Religion and Public Life, Military Ethics, Elitism, Evolutionary Theory of Law, Commons and Private Property, Modern State. He edited many works by [[Bruno Leoni]] in English, French, Italian, Spanish and Czech.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Leoni, ''Law, Liberty and the Competitive Market'', con una prefazione di Richard A. Epstein, New Brunswick NJ, Transaction, 2008; Bruno Leoni, ''La liberté et le droit'', Paris, Les Belles Lettres, 2006; Bruno Leoni, Lezioni di Filosofia del diritto, Soveria Mannelli, Rubbettino, 2003; Bruno Leoni, ''Lecciones de Filosofía del Derecho'', Madrid, Union Editorial, 2008; Bruno Leoni, ''Pravo a svoboda'', Praha, Liberalni Institut, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently Professor of Philosophy of Law at the University of Verona&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispi.unisi.it/it/dipartimento/docenti/carlo-lottieri Personal page in Siena.]&lt;/ref&gt; and Professor of Philosophy of Law and Philosophy of Social Sciences at [[Facoltà di Teologia di Lugano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teologialugano.ch/lottieri-carlo.html Personal page in Lugano.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and thought==
In the years 2003–04 Lottieri taught Philosophy of Social Sciences at [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]] and in 2011 he has been visiting professor at [[University of Provence|Aix-en-Provence]]. Fellow of many institutions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icer.it/ International Centre of Economic Research de Turin], [https://www.mises.org/ The Ludwig von Mises Institute], [http://www.ies-europe.org Institute of Economic Studies], [http://www.institutconstant.ch/index.php Institut Constant de Rebecque].&lt;/ref&gt; he is the Director of Political Theory department of the [[Istituto Bruno Leoni]] (IBL), based in Turin.&lt;ref&gt;For IBL Lottieri has written many papers in defense of individual rights and free-market values. See for instance: Carlo Lottieri, [http://brunoleonimedia.servingfreedom.net/BP/IBL_BP_20_EU_China_en.pdf The Opening of the Chinese Market and Individual Rights] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925113041/http://brunoleonimedia.servingfreedom.net/BP/IBL_BP_20_EU_China_en.pdf |date=September 25, 2011 }}, IBL Briefing Paper, June 25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Lottieri's research develops a radical libertarianism combining a strong emphasis on the inviolability of other people (marked by the influence of [[Emmanuel Lévinas]]) and a realistic approach to the modern State, largely influenced by [[Elitism|Italian elitist school]], [[Carl Schmitt]]'s scholarship and [[Public Choice]] and [[Austrian School]] economists. Following Raimondo Cubeddu and Alberto Mingardi, in his work Lottieri "argues for the legitimacy of many so-called 'monopolistic practices' (cartels, monopolization, mergers,  predatory pricing…), and for the legitimacy of conglomerates, and big business at large,  vis-à-vis those governmental agencies built to thoroughly implement 'competition' from top to bottom".&lt;ref&gt;Raimondo Cubeddu - Alberto Mingardi, "Preface", ''Ethics &amp; Politics'', 2003, 2, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
His last book emphasizes the historic features of the modern State, suggesting to libertarian scholars to understand the cultural and even theological implications of the struggle between the rulers and the ruled.&lt;ref&gt;Partially, this topic had been examined in a previous paper written in cooperation with an Italian colleague: Luigi Marco Bassani - Carlo Lottieri, "The Problem of Security; Historicity of the State and "European Realism", in Hans-Hermann Hoppe, ''The Myth of National Defense'', Auburn AL, The Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deer Park Monastery''' ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: '''Tu Viện Lộc Uyển''',) is a {{convert|400|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Buddhist]] sanctuary in [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[California]].  It was founded in July 2000 by monastic and lay practitioners from [[Plum Village]], [[France]].

The [[monastery]] is under the direct guidance of [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] and his [[Order of Interbeing (Tiep Hien)|Order of Interbeing]] in the [[Vietnamese Zen]] tradition.  Deer Park follows the same practices and schedule as Plum Village and its sister monastery [[Blue Cliff Monastery]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Magnolia Village Practice Center]] in Mississippi.

Since its founding the monastery has grown to be very active. In addition to its regular monastic schedule, Deer Park hosts twice-weekly days of mindfulness which are open to the public as well as a variety of themed and general retreats.   Deer Park hosts an annual retreat when [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] travels to [[North America]].  Over the years the ordained [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] has been growing and currently consists of 14 monks and 23 nuns.  Lay practitioners also live at the monastery.

The monastery is now composed of two hamlets; Solidity Hamlet for monks and laymen and Clarity Hamlet for nuns and laywomen.

All retreats at Deer Park Monastery include the basic practices of [[sitting meditation]] and [[chanting]], [[walking meditation]], mindful eating, group discussions, touching the Earth, total relaxation, and working meditation. Depending on the retreat, extra activities may include private consultations, mountain hiking, bonfire, and song &amp; skit performances. Retreats are for beginners and experienced practitioners of meditation.

'''Donald Brook''' (born 8 January 1927) is an Australian artist, art critic and theorist whose research and publications centre on the philosophy of art, non-verbal representation and [[cultural evolution]]. He initiated the [http://aeaf.org.au Experimental Art Foundation] in [[Adelaide]] and is Emeritus Professor of Visual Arts in the [[Flinders University]], Bedford Park, South Australia.

==Early life and education==
Brook was born in [[Leeds]], [[Yorkshire]] and educated on scholarships at Woodhouse Grove School and at the [[University of Leeds]], where he read Electrical Engineering. He left before graduating with the intention of becoming an artist and was conscripted in the army toward the end of WWII. He received a Further Education and Training grant in 1949 to study sculpture at the King Edward VII School of Art in the [[University of Durham]].
 
After graduating (B.A. Fine arts) with first class honours in 1953 [[Henry Moore]] and [[William Coldstream]] were his external examiners, he spent a further year on a Chancellor’s postgraduate award researching [[Ancient Greek sculpture|Archaic]] and [[Cycladic art|Cycladic sculpture]] in Greece. Thereafter he established a practice as a sculptor, exhibiting at the Woodstock Gallery in London and executing commissions, and was awarded a studio and residence at the Digswell Arts Trust at Welwyn in Hertfordshire, His interest in unresolved theoretical questions about the visual arts led him to accept a further postgraduate scholarship in the Department of Philosophy in the [[Australian National University]] in Canberra in 1962. His PhD thesis (1965), examined by Professors [[E. H. Gombrich]] and [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], applied analytic-philosophical theories of perception to questions of pictorial representation and art-critical appraisal.

===Professional career===

Electing to remain in Australia, Brook continued to work as a sculptor and as art critic of the [[Canberra Times]] under John Pringle’s editorship. Later (from 1968) he became art critic of the [[Sydney Morning Herald]] when he was appointed as one of the three first academics in the new [[Power Institute of Fine Arts]] in the [[University of Sydney]]. During this period (1968-1973) he was an energetic initiator of the so-called ‘Tin Sheds’ workshops, where his promotion of what he then called  ‘post-object art’–more generally referred to at the time as ‘conceptual art,’ &lt;ref&gt;[1]‘Toward a definition of 'conceptual art.' Leonardo 5 (1972): 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;—was found liberating by many of the younger artists. His 1969 John Power Memorial Lecture ‘Flight from the Object’ &lt;ref&gt;[2]The 1969 John Power Lecture in Contemporary Art. Flight from the object. Sydney: Power Institute of Fine Arts, 1970. 1-22. Reprinted in Ed. Bernard Smith, Concerning Contemporary Art, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1974 and as "El alejamiento del objeto estetico" in Ed. Bernard Smith, Interpretacion y analysis del ARTE ACTUAL, Trans. Jesus Ortiz, Pamplona: Eunsa, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a radical alternative to the ideas that animated [[Clement Greenberg|Clement Greenberg’s]] 1968 Power Lecture ‘Avant-garde Attitudes.’ Australian painters had generally taken their options to be restricted to the choice of international mainstream modernism or the purposeful construction of a distinctively Australian style.

In 1973 he was appointed to the inaugural chair of Fine Arts at the Flinders University, where he contentiously changed the departmental name from ‘Fine Arts’ to ‘Visual Arts.’ He initiated theoretical studies in the psychology and philosophy of visual perception and introduced a study of Aboriginal visual culture in a context where European Art History had previously dominated. At that time no practical studio courses were offered in any Australian University. From 1974 he therefore initiated the [http://aeaf.org.au Experimental Art Foundation] in the city of Adelaide. This was partly designed to enrol practising artists, along with academics and theorists, to bridge what he called ‘the gap between town and gown.’ He also introduced postgraduate academic programs for practising artists.

Brook abandoned art criticism after leaving Sydney, and published extensively thereafter in journals of informed opinion and more popular media as well as in the academic literature. He retired from Flinders at the end of 1989 and lived in Cyprus from 1990–92, returning temporarily to a part-time role at the University of Western Australia before settling again in Adelaide.

===Theoretical contributions===

Although they are wide-ranging, Brook’s philosophical interests have centred on two principal regions of speculation:  to understand the nature and place of perception and non-verbal representation in the visual arts, and to elucidate the relationship between art, the histories of works of art and the dynamics of cultural evolution. His early work on perception was first publicly aired in ‘Perception and the appraisal of sculpture’,&lt;ref&gt;[3]‘Perception and the appraisal of sculpture.’ Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 27 (1969): 323-30.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the important distinction he later draws between matching and simulating non-verbal representational practices is introduced as a difference between what he calls the ‘object accounts’ and the ‘picture accounts’ that we spontaneously give of visually perceived things; notably of three-dimensional works of art. Crucial to his thinking is the idea that non-verbal representation is not a quasi-linguistic form of communication. It relies on the de facto socially efficacious substitutability of one thing for another thing even in cases where relevant properties are not shared. He argues that this perceptually mediated substitutive felicity must have been available to pre-linguistic organisms or language itself could not possibly have evolved.

Brook’s elucidation of the concept of art, as what he at first called ‘experimental modelling of actual and possible worlds,’ is first comprehensively spelled out in his paper ‘A new theory of art’.&lt;ref&gt;[4]‘A new theory of art.’ British Journal of Aesthetics 20 (1980): 305-321.&lt;/ref&gt; This rather complex theoretical structure underwent continuous modification in numerous publications as his [[memetic]] account of cultural evolution developed. He embraced [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins’]] concept of the [[meme]] as the potent factor in cultural evolution, analogous to the function of the [[gene]] in biological evolution. However, he differed significantly from Dawkins and other meme-theorists in his way of understanding and exemplifying the meme. Instead of offering such examples as the popular song or catchphrase he insisted that these things are items of a cultural kind analogous to the items of biological kinds such as a horse, or a cabbage. Just as a horse is the product of appropriately activated genes, he argues that a popular song or a catchphrase is not itself a meme. It is an item of a predictable cultural kind that is generated by exercising memes. Memes are purposefully directed actions that can be exercised in concerted ways, as contrasted with mere behaviours. This is first unambiguously elucidated in his paper ‘Art history?’.&lt;ref&gt;[5]‘Art history?’ History and Theory 43 (February 2004), 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brook’s account of art as the essentially unexpected recognition of the viability of new memes is spelled out in his book The awful truth about what art is (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[6]The awful truth about what art is. Artlink, Adelaide, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is succeeded by his semi-autobiographical book Get A life (2014) &lt;ref&gt;[7]Get a life. Artlink, Adelaide, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; in which an anthology of his papers on perception, representation, art, evolution and history is strung together along a string of text that is intended to place them in the context of his personal history and experience.

'''Drafting''' is the preliminary stage of a written work in which the author begins to develop a more cohesive product. A '''draft document''' is the product the writer creates in the initial stages of the [[writing process]].

In the drafting stage, the author:
* develops a more cohesive text
* organizes thoughts
* explains examples/ideas
* uncovers transitions
* discovers a central argument/point
* elaborates on key ideas

In a book that became popular in the 1950s, ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', famed authors Strunk and White describe the first draft as being a less edited version of the final draft.  In their book, Strunk and White say, “the first principle of composition is to foresee or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.&lt;ref&gt;The Elements of Style Fiftieth Anniversary Edition (2009), p. 15, {{ISBN|978-0-205-63264-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;” This shape is the draft that eventually becomes the finished work.

More recently, [[Peter Elbow]], in his book ''Writing Without Teachers'', presents a very different view of the drafting stage in the [[writing process]]. He describes his stance on the writing process, saying “Writing is a way to end up thinking something you couldn’t have started out thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. Writing Without Teachers. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford UP, 1973, 1998. p.15&lt;/ref&gt;” According to Elbow, the best way to accomplish this is a series of drafts which come together to produce an emerging “center of gravity” that then translates into the main focus on the work. This process should be a holistic process, not a linear process. Elbow’s reasoning behind this concept of multiple drafts follows the idea that, “if he learns to maximize the interaction among his own ideas or points of view, he can produce new ones that didn’t seem available to him.&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. Writing Without Teachers. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford UP, 1973, 1998. p.50&lt;/ref&gt;”

Whether being used as the creation of a less-edited final product (Strunk and White) or as a tool during the prewriting stage (Elbow), drafting is a necessary stage for the writer in the writing process.  Having created a draft, the author is then able to move onto the revision.

{{Original research|date=May 2012}}
'''''{{transl|ar|DIN|Dunyā}}''''' ({{lang-ar|دُنْيا}} {{IPA-ar|ˈdʊnjæː|}}) is originally an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word that was passed to many other languages such as [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Dari language|Dari]], [[Pashto]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Aromanian language|Arumanian]], [[North Caucasian languages|North-Caucasian languages]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. It derives from the root word "dana" that means to bring near. In that sense, "dunya" is "what is brought near".&lt;ref&gt;Attas, Islam and Secularism, p. &lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} It refers to the temporal world—and its earthly concerns and possessions—as opposed to the hereafter (''[[Akhirah|ʾākhirah]]'').{{Citation needed|date= October 2011}} In the [[Qur'an]], ''dunyā'' and ''ākhira'' are sometimes used [[Dichotomy|dichotomously]], other times complementarily. Islam does not a priori dismiss the world as "evil"&lt;!-- Neither does Christianity, that would be gnosticism --&gt;. Instead, this world is defined as "the field of ''ākhira''" and the place of examination. Two Qur'anic [[ayah|ayat]] (verses) show that ''dunyā'' and ''ākhira'' are not considered as alternatives to each other per se:

* "Ordain for us the good in this world [''al-dunyā''] and in the hereafter [''al-ākhira'']." ([[Al-A'raf|''Surah Al A'râf'']] 7:156)
* "You are my friend in this world [''al-dunyā''] and the next [''al-ākhira'']." (''[[Yusuf (surah)|Surah Yusuf]]'' 12:101)

What the Qur'an condemns is too much attention to the earthly life at the cost of forgetting the eternal life. For this purpose, Muslims are encouraged in the Qur'an 47:24 to ponder the verses of the Qur'an itself, and to do their best to not get too attached to this temporal existence and its trappings. In Islam, ''dunyā'' is a test; success and failure lead to paradise and hell respectively Quran 57:20.

==Modern usage==
The word Dunya is being used today by all Arabic speaking nations as well as other languages that borrowed it from Arabic. 

For example;
*''{{transl|arz|Donya/Denya}}'' {{IPA-arz|ˈdonjæ, ˈdenjæ|}} in [[Egyptian Arabic]]
*Dünya in Turkish
*Dinya in Kurdish
*दुनिया (Duniya) in Hindi, Marathi and Nepali
*দুনিয়া (Duniẏā) in Bengali and Assamese
*ਦੁਨੀਆ (Dunī'ā) in Punjabi
*{{lang|fa|دنیا}} (Dunya) in Urdu, Sindhi, Punjabi and Persian
*(Dunway) in Sylheti
*Duniya in Hausa
*Duniah in [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]],&lt;ref&gt;Keay, John (1983) ''When Men and Mountains Meet'' {{ISBN|0-7126-0196-1}}; p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Dunia in Malay, Swahili and Indonesian
*Donya in Javanese

It is also a common Middle Eastern feminine name.

'''Edmund Faustyn Biernacki''' (19 December 1866 in [[Opoczno]] &amp;ndash; 29 December 1911 in [[Lwów]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[physician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edmund Faustyn Biernacki|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2783.html|work=Whonamedit?|publisher=Ole Daniel Enersen|accessdate=31 March 2013|author=Zbigniew Gutkiewicz}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Biernacki was the first one to note a relationship between the sedimentation rate of red blood cells in a human blood sample and the general condition of the organism. This method, known as the [[Biernacki Reaction]], is used worldwide to assess [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR), which is one of the major [[blood test]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biernacki's test|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/3352.html|work=Whonamedit?|publisher=Ole Daniel Enersen|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ephectic''' ({{lang-grc|ἐφεκτικός}}, ''ephektikos'') potentially describes three interrelated concepts: 1) a type of skeptic, 2) the practice of a type of skepticism, or 3) the general state of being "given to suspense of judgment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ephectic|title = ephectic|date = |accessdate = |website = Merriam Webster|publisher = Merriam Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eytmology ==
Ephectic comes from the Ancient Greek ἐφεκτικός (''ephektikos''), which itself dervives from the verb ἐπέχειν (''epechein''), meaning to hold back.

== Definition ==
[[Pyrrho]] was an ancient philosopher credited with forming the first comprehensive school of [[skepticism|skeptical thought]], now described as Pyrrhonism, or Pyrrhonian Skepticism. The school of though can be further divided into ephectic Pyrrhonism, aporetic Pyrrhonism or zetetic Pyrrhonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Etymological Compendium, Or, Portfolio of Origins and Inventions|last = Pulleyn|first = William|publisher = T. Tegg|year = 1830|isbn = |location = |pages = 353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Pyrrho, others had given the same rationale for which he is famed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers|last = Laertius|first = Diogenes|publisher = H. G. Bohn|year = 1853|isbn = |location = |pages = 405–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ephectic Pyrrhonism'' can describe either a state, attitude, or practice, with the state sometimes experienced after "balanc[ing] perceptions and thoughts against one another".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Scepticism|last = Bett|first = Richard Arnot Home|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2010-01-28|isbn = |location = |pages = 213}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a less aggressive form of skepticism which may occur in that sometimes "[s]uspension of judgment evidently just happens to the sceptic".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Aporetic Pyrrhonism'', in contrast, describes a "more argumentative form of scepticism, one that works more actively towards its goal". Aporetic skepticism may also be described as a state of perplexity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Western Philosophy, Volume 2|last = McInerny|first = Ralph|publisher = Aeterna Press|year = 1969|isbn = |location = |pages = Chp III. Skeptics and the New Academy, A. Pyrrho of Elis section, para 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are actively "engaged in refutation".

''Zetetic Pyrrhonism'', differing from the two, is "engaged in seeking".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Scepticism|last = Bett|first = Richard Arnot Home|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = Jan 28, 2010|isbn = |location = |pages = 212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While an ephectic merely suspends judgment on a matter however arriving at that point, an aporetic skeptic engages in refutation, a form of argument before either reaching an ephectic state, an aporia (impasse), continued seeking or refutation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
[[File:Friedrich Nietzsche-1872.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Nietzsche was critical of Pyrrhonian ephectics.]]

One benefit of practicing ephectic Pyrrhonism is that it may be a path to happiness. It has been argued "that Pyrrho was teaching an attitude" and "it seems clear that it was intended as a way of producing happiness ... [he was] said to have possessed the great certitude that suspension of judgment and indifference is the key to happiness."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On the other hand, one criticism takes the form of a joke, a sly attack on the value of ephectic Pyrrhonism by [[Samuel Beckett]] that presupposes that "If one may only be ephectic unawares, then not to know so proves one to be ephectic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Beckett &amp; La Psychanaylse &amp; Psychoanalysis, Vol 5|last = Houppermans|first = Sjef|publisher = Rodopi|year = 1996|isbn = |location = |pages = 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, being ephectic admits to flaws not only of "one's ignorance" but also of "man's palsied moral and intellectual nature" as well as the very "nature of language itself".

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] criticized the concept as a flaw of early philosophers, who he characterized as "shy little blunderer[s] and milquetoast[s] with crooked legs" prone to overindulging "his doubting drive, his negating drive, his wait-and-see ('ephectic') drive, his analytical drive, his exploring, searching, venturing drive, his comparing, balancing drive, his will to [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]] and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], his will to every ''[[sine ira et studio]]'': have we already grasped that for the longest time they all went against the first demands of [[morality]] and [[conscience]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On the Genealogy of Morality|author1=Friedrich Nietzsche |author2=Maudemarie Clark |author3=Alan J. Swensen |publisher = Hackett Publishing|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = 79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''erratum''' or '''corrigendum''' (plurals: '''errata''', '''corrigenda''') (comes from {{lang-la|[[wikt:errata corrige|errata corrige]]}}) is a correction of a published text. As a general rule, publishers issue an erratum for a production error (i.e., an error introduced during the publishing process) and a corrigendum for an author's error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/authors/policies/corrections.html|title=Authors and referees &amp;mdash; corrections|accessdate=2017-02-10|publisher=Nature publishing group|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801122211/http://www.nature.com/authors/policies/corrections.html|archivedate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; An erratum is most commonly issued shortly after its original text is published. 

Patches to security issues in a [[computer program]] are also sometimes called errata. ''Erratum'', like ''corrigendum'', can also be used as a term for an error itself.

==Errata sheets==
According to the ''[[Chicago Manual of Style]]'', "Errata, lists of errors and their corrections, may take the form of loose, inserted sheets or bound-in pages. An errata sheet is definitely not a usual part of a book. It should never be supplied to correct simple [[typographical error]]s (which may be rectified in a later printing) or to insert additions to, or revisions of, the printed text (which should wait for the next edition of the book). It is a device to be used only in extreme cases where errors severe enough to cause misunderstanding are detected too late to correct in the normal way but before the finished book is distributed. Then the errors may be listed with their locations and their corrections on a sheet that is [[tipped-in page|tipped in]], either before or after the book is bound, or laid in loose, usually inside the front cover of the book. (Tipping and inserting must be done by hand, thus adding considerably to the cost of the book.)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://writerservices.net/errata_sheet.php ''The Chicago Manual of Style'']. The University of Chicago Press, 14th Edition 1993, ISBN (cloth) 0-226-10389-7, p. 42, section 1.107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==CPU logic ==
Design errors and mistakes in a [[Central processing unit|CPU]]'s hardwired logic may also be documented and described as errata. One well-publicized example is [[Intel]]'s "FDIV" erratum in early [[Intel P5 (microarchitecture)|Pentium]] processors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://support.intel.com/support/processors/pentium/fdiv/

|archivedate=2001-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the [[Pentium FDIV bug]]. This gave incorrect answers to a floating-point division instruction (FDIV) for a small set of numbers, due to an incorrect lookup table inside the Pentium chip.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2891">'''Eternal Now''' is a concept of time perception suggested by numerous proponents of [[New Age]] spirituality. Its characteristics vary from increased awareness of the present moment to a broader, more open and holistic perception of one's subjective past and potential variants of future. The concept is consonant with and constitutes an integration and development of a number of approaches to spiritual alertness and totality of perception advocated by various forms of Buddhist philosophy (in particular [[Zen]] Buddhism), [[Shamanic]] practices, and other philosophical and spiritual directions, both ancient and contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Power of Now]]: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment'', New World Library, October, 1999 {{ISBN|1-57731-152-3}} (HC) {{ISBN|1-57731-480-8}} (PB)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Practicing the Power of Now: Essential Teachings, Meditations, and Exercises from The Power of Now'', New World Library, October 10, 2001 {{ISBN|1-57731-195-7}} (HC)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The principle of evidential existentiality''' in [[philosophy]] is a principle that explains and gives value to the [[existence]] of entities. The principle states that the reality of an entity's existence gives greater value to prove its existence than would be given through any outward studies. The principle has become a backbone of [[Arguments for the existence of God|the God argument]], stating that because God is a [[self-evidence|self-evident]] entity, His existence can only be shared by humans, thus proof of God is unnecessary and moot.
It appears that the existence is primarily evident to the self only. The God or Supreme self is perceivable to the self. So evidentially self perception is followed by God perception and so on.

'''Gregg Lambert''' (born 1961) is an American philosopher and literary theorist, who writes on [[Baroque]] and Neo-Baroque cultural history, critical theory and film, the contemporary university, and especially on the philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. Between 2008 and 2014, he was the founding director of Syracuse University Humanities Center, where he currently holds a research appointment as Dean’s Professor of Humanities.

== Biography ==
Lambert earned a Bachelor's degree in English, with a minor in Religion, from [[Pacific University]] in 1983 and an MA in English and Creative Writing from [[Portland State University]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;http://asfaculty.syr.edu/pages/humanities/_pdfs_docs/LambertCV2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1984 and 1987, Lambert was a Fellow in the Center for Hermeneutic Studies at the Graduate Theological Union, where he completed a Masters program in Theology and Literature, and graduate studies in French and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley. He received a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and Critical Theory from the University of California at Irvine under the direction of the late-French philosopher Jacques Derrida and literary theorist [[Gabriele Schwab]].

In 1996, Lambert joined the Department of English at [[Syracuse University]] and was later appointed as Chair between 2005 and 2008, before leaving the department to take up his current position at the Syracuse University Humanities Center.&lt;ref&gt;http://as-cascade.syr.edu/profiles/pages/lambert-gregg.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, Lambert is also Principal Investigator of the Central New York Humanities Corridor.&lt;ref&gt;Syracuse University News, September 24, 2008, "Gregg Lambert assumes leadership of CNY Humanities Corridor" &lt;http://www.syr.edu/news/archive/story.php?id=5309&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 he was elected as a member of the International Advisory Board of the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chcinetwork.org/about/advisory-board/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304005051/http://chcinetwork.org/about/advisory-board/ |archivedate=2014-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Consisting of several books and edited volumes, Lambert's published work covers a wide range of disciplines and topics, including the history of literary criticism and theory, contemporary continental philosophy, philosophy of religion, issues in the general Humanities and contemporary academic institutions. He has also published over fifty articles in peer reviewed journals in several different fields, encyclopedias, textbooks and collected volumes. Lambert's writings have been translated into Chinese, French, Korean, Japanese, Norwegian, and other languages. Lambert is co-editor of the academic journal Deleuze Studies (University of Edinburgh Press).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euppublishing.com/page/dls/editorialBoard&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambert is a noted optimist about the future of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Syracuse University News, September 19, 2014, 'Syracuse Professor Featured in New Humanities Documentary' &lt;http://news.syr.edu/syracuse-professor-featured-in-new-humanities-documentary-39272&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though he admits that the humanities have taken their share of hits in recent years, like cuts in funding and an increasing emphasis on science and technology within society and the academy, Lambert is optimistic about the future of the humanities. In his view, the supposed 'crisis in the humanities' is primarily a media hyperbole, which has nothing to do with the real situation in the humanities today. Several of his projects actively perform his main argument for the vitality of the contemporary humanities, which centers around the idea that “the academy is providing opportunities for humanities students to cope with the new paradigm of globalization”.&lt;ref&gt;Targeted News Services, January 28, 2010, 'Gregg Lambert charts global course for the humanities'&lt;/ref&gt;

As Co-Founder of The [[Perpetual Peace]] Project,&lt;ref&gt;Project website &lt;http://perpetualpeaceproject.org/concept.php&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; a partnership between the European Union National Institutes of Culture (EUNIC), the International Peace Institute (IPI), the United Nations University, Slought Foundation, Syracuse University, Utrecht University, and the Treaty of Utrecht Foundation, Lambert is engaged in bringing together theorists and practitioners in revisiting 21st century prospects for international peace, on the basis of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s foundational essay "[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]" (1795).&lt;ref&gt;Syracuse University News, December 13, 2013, 'Giving Peace A Chance' &lt;http://news.syr.edu/giving-peace-a-chance%E2%80%A8-20913/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the producer of a film by the same name, which consists of a series of short videos of several philosophers, sociologists, and diplomats speaking about peace.&lt;ref&gt;Educational Media Reviews Online &lt;http://emro.lib.buffalo.edu/emro/emroDetail.asp?Number=4450&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Lambert also serves on the Advisory Board of the Histories of Violence project.&lt;ref&gt;Histories of Violence website &lt;http://historiesofviolence.com/network/advisory-board/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

His most recent book ''Philosophy after Friendship: Deleuze's Conceptual Personae'' (University of Minnesota Press, 2017) deals with the history of political philosophy's "conceptual personae" (Deleuze): the friend, the enemy, the stranger, the migrant, and the refugee or survivor.

[[File:HastingsRashdall.jpg|thumb|right|Hastings Rashdall]]
'''Hastings Rashdall''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (24 June 1858, London – 9 February 1924, [[Worthing]]) was an English philosopher, theologian, and historian. He expounded a theory known as [[Utilitarianism#Ideal utilitarianism|ideal utilitarianism]], and he was a major historian of the universities of the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;"Rashdall, Hastings," ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', where Rashdall's ''The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages'' is referred to as "a standard work."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Rashdall was the son of an [[Anglican]] priest. He was educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]]&lt;ref&gt;'RASHDALL, Very Rev. Hastings', Who Was Who, A &amp; C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2015; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U201990, accessed 20 March 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; and received a scholarship for [[New College, Oxford|New College]], Oxford. After short tenures at [[St David's University College]] and [[University College, Durham]], Rashdall was made a Fellow of first [[Hertford College, Oxford]], then [[New College, Oxford]], and dedicates his main work, ''[[The Theory of Good and Evil]]'' (1907), to the memory of his teachers [[Thomas Hill Green]] and [[Henry Sidgwick]].

The dedication is appropriate, for the particular version of utilitarianism put forward by Rashdall owes elements to both Green and Sidgwick.&lt;ref&gt;"Rashdall, Hastings," ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.''&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas he holds that the concepts of good and value are logically prior to that of right, he gives right a more than instrumental significance. His idea of good owes more to Green than to the hedonistic utilitarians. "The ideal of human life is not the mere juxtaposition of distinct goods, but a whole in which each good is made different by the presence of others." Rashdall has been eclipsed as a moral philosopher by [[G. E. Moore]], who advocated similar views in his earlier work ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' (1903). Rashdall was also a [[George Berkeley|Berkeleyan]], believing in metaphysical [[idealism]].

His historical study, ''The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Quarterly Review|title=Review of ''The European Universities of the Middle Ages'' by Hastings Rashdall|volume=183|date=April 1896|pages=445–472|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044092526664;view=1up;seq=455}}&lt;/ref&gt; was described in the introduction to its recent reprinting as "one of the first comparative works on the subject" whose "scope and breadth has assured its place as a key work in intellectual history."

His ''The Idea of Atonement in Christian Theology'' surveyed different approaches to the Christian doctrine of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], concluding with an influential defence of the "subjective" theory of the atonement that Rashdall attributed to both [[Peter Abelard]] and [[Peter Lombard]]. Rashdall argued that the "objective" view of the atonement associated with [[Anselm of Canterbury]] was inadequate, and that the most authentically Christian doctrine was that Christ's life was a demonstration of God's love so profound that Christ was willing to die rather than compromise his character. This in turn inspires believers to emulate his character and his intimacy with the Father.&lt;ref&gt;''The Idea of Atonement in Christian Theology'', pp. 437–47&lt;/ref&gt;

Rashdall received the degree [[Doctor of Letters]] (DL) from New College, Oxford, in October 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Friday |date=18 October 1901 |page_number=4 |issue=36589| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1904 to 1907, a member of the [[Christian Social Union (Church of England)|Christian Social Union]] from its inception in 1890, and was an influential [[Anglican]] modernist theologian of the time, being appointed to a canonry in 1909.

He was Dean of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] from 1917 to 1924, and died of cancer in [[Worthing]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;''Dean Rashdall.''  [[The Times]] (London, England), Monday, 11 February 1924; pg. 17; Issue 43572&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12613">Since 2002, the '''Innsbruck School of Peace and Conflict Studies''' has been developed by [[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]] and his team at the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies at the [[University of Innsbruck]], Austria. On January 1, 2017 a Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies was established at the University of Innsbruck's Faculty for Social and Political Sciences, which has a mandate for conducting Peace and Conflict Studies Research and is home to the Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies, with its UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies and its MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation.

== Research and Publications ==
The Innsbruck School of Peace and Conflict Studies became famous for its unique approach to peace research with the key phrase “transrational peaces” and with its specific and tough training method in the sense of [[John Paul Lederach]]'s elicitive conflict transformation”. Both principles are applied in practice and developed further in the frame of the MA Program for Peace Studies.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies (2014): MA Program, available at URL: http://www.uibk.ac.at/peacestudies/ma-program/, last accessed November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The UNESCO Chair promotes further research in these fields and the publication of the respective results, in the following book series:
* Many Peaces Trilogy (Palgrave) by Wolfgang Dietrich: Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture (Vol. 1), Elicitive Conflict Transformation and the Transrational Shift in Peace Politics (Vol.2) and Elicitive Conflict Mapping (Vol 3, in translation).
* Elicitivas (Verlag Springer, featuring Juan José Albert Gutiérrez (translated by Matthias Gossner) and Winfried Wagner.
* Masters of Peace (LIT, Verlag Springer), featuring the works of Samrat Schmiem Kumar, Katya Buchleitner, Paula Ditzel Facci, Paul Bukuluki, Natalia Lozano Mancera, Alicia Dueck, Catalina Vallejo Piedrahíta, [https://www.prio.org/People/Person/?x=8154 Noor Jdid], Kathleen McGoey, Billene Seyoum Woldeyes, Sophie Friedel, [http://adhamhamed.com Adham Hamed], Morten Frederiksen, Heela Najibullah and Jennie Sandstad.

Furthermore, a series of edited Volumes has emerged in the framework of the Innsbruck School:
Key Texts of Peace Studies (Die Kommende Demokratie Series, LIT)
Palgrave Handbook of Peace Studies (Palgrave)
Transrational Resonances (Palgrave)

[[Norbert Koppensteiner]],&lt;ref&gt;Koppensteiner, Norbert (2014): Norbert Koppensteiner: Home. Available at URL: http://koppensteiner.wissweb.at, last accessed November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; a Dietrich-student and program coordinator at the MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation, is another important representative of the Innsbruck School of Peace and Conflict Studies. In his book The Art of the Transpersonal Self he draws on findings of humanistic and transpersonal psychology. His work can be seen as a critique of some of Modernity’s founding principles like truth. Koppensteiner argues that the autonomous and self grounded subject, morals or solvability of conflicts have become sites of contestation and debate. He suggests to re-think some of those categories being debated in (post)modernity by invoking transpersonal and transrational transpositions. Asking about the continued possibilities for subjectivation, Koppensteiner sketches the outlines of an art of living for a subjectivity perceived as constantly emergent and in transformation, a subjectivity that dares to embrace conflict as part of its transpersonal relational becoming and that emerges through an ongoing transformation of the self understood as an aesthetic (Apollonian) and energetic (Dionysian) practice. The strictly relational understanding of peaces and conflict that Koppensteiner proposes is one of the central ontological assumptions of the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies.

Other important representatives of the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies are Josefina Echavarría (Research and Publications Coordinator), Daniela Ingruber (Coordinator MA Program), Jennifer Murphy and Andreas Oberprantacher. Each academic year leading international scholars of Peace and Conflict Studies visit the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies and its MA Program at the University of Innsbruck.

=== Transrational Peace Philosophy ===
The Innsbruck School of Peace Studies is based on [[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]]'s transrational approach to Peace Studies and is outlined in his Many Peaces Trilogy. Spanning continents as well as disciplines, Dietrich presents a panorama of diverse interpretations of peace in world history and culture. In a journey through time and space, Dietrich outlines the so-called five families of peace - energetic, moral, modern, post-modern and trans-rational. He stresses the importance of combining rationality and reason with human properties such as emotion and spirituality in applied peace work. This ontological assumption indicates a paradigm shift and proposes a new epistemological understanding of peace, which is at the heart of the Innsbruck School's peace philosophy.

=== Elicitive Conflict Transformation ===
Elicitive Conflict Transformation was first introduced to the field by John Paul Lederach in 1995 and is the applied method of transrational peace philosophy. Drawing on the debate on [[multi-track diplomacy]], Lederach initially distinguished between three levels of conflict: 
# Top Leaders
# Middle-Range Leaders
# Grassroots

Wolfgang Dietrich draws on Lederach's systemic approach to conflict and developed a multi-layered model of conflict analysis. Furthermore, he systematizes elective conflict transformation techniques in three main groups: 
# Voice Oriented Approaches to Conflict Transformation; e.g. non-violent communication after Marshall Rosenberg and Theme-Centered Interaction after Ruth Cohn.
# Body-oriented approaches to conflict transformation; e.g. [[Theatre for Living]] after [[David Diamond (theatre)|David Diamond]], Butho- and Five Rhythms Dance, after Gabrielle Roth
# breath oriented approaches to conflict transformation; e.g. Holotropic Breathwork after [[Stanislav Grof]] and Sylvester Walch.

All three types of approaches to conflict share a strong reference to systems theory and hence a strictly relational understanding of conflicts.

=== Elicitive Conflict Mapping ===
Elicitive Conflict Mapping is a brand-new tool that has been developed at the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies. By bringing together the theoretical and academic building blocks of the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies in a didactical format, with special emphasis on the graphic components, ECM aims to support those in search of:
* Understanding and clarifying the conflict episode
* Visibilizing the conflict parties
* Viewing the conflict dynamics at different levels and through different layers&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies (2014): Elicitive Conflict Mapping Available at URL: http://www.uibk.ac.at/peacestudies/ecm/, last accessed November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;


== Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies ==
In January 2017 the Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies was inaugurated at the University of Innsbruck's Faculty for Social and Political Sciences. The Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies consists of the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies, which is the rooftop for a large number of research and cooperation projects and the MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation.

=== UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies ===
The UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies of the University of Innsbruck was established in June 2008 as a consequence of the systematic research on the interpretations of peaces and the unique approach to peace studies as developed by Innsbruck’s MA program for Peace Studies since 2001. The agreement has been signed between the UNESCO, represented by its Director-General Koichiro Matsuura, and the University of Innsbruck, represented by its rector Karlheinz Töchterle.

In the light of the excellent results achieved and confirmed by the positive evaluation of the report on its activities, UNESCO renewed in February 2015 the 2008 agreement concerning the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies at the University of Innsbruck until June 2019.

According to the agreement the main purposes of the UNESCO Chair are:
# the promotion of an integrated system of research, training, information and documentation in the field of peace studies;
# the facilitation of collaboration between high-level, internationally recognized researchers and teaching staff of the University and other institutions in Austria, in Europe and North America, and other regions of the world;
# the reinforcement of the existing network of cooperating partners through further regional, as well as international, cooperation;
# the enhancement and complement of the already existing on-line teaching methods;
# the exchange of professors, researchers, and students with other universities within the framework of UNITWIN/UNESCO Chairs Programme.

=== The MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Studies ===
Founded in 2002, the MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation has become a leading Masters Program, training the next generation of Peace and Conflict Studies scholars and Conflict Workers. In its didactical approach the program follows a relational approach to conflict of elective conflict transformation, which is conveyed to the students in theory and practice. After the successful completion of an MA thesis students are awarded the academic title Master of Arts (120 ECTS Credit Points). The first UNESCO Chairholder Professor Wolfgang Dietrich is the third academic director of the MA Program, following Prof. [[Anton Pelinka]] and Prof. Alan Scott in this function.

=== Unit for Peace Studies Alumni Network ===
Established in 2008, a vast amount of alumni initiatives have emerged within the active network of graduates from the MA Program in Peace and Conflict Studies. Amongst others this includes the Innsbruck Academic Festival of Many Peaces, the Many Peaces Magazine, the Peace Fund and the Many Peaces e.V..

==== Many Peaces Festival ====
The Innsbruck Academic Festival of Many Peaces is an international peace and conflict studies conference, facilitating a dialogue amongst scholars engaged within the field of transrational peace philosophy, as well as practitioners, within the field of elective conflict transformation. The 1st Innsbruck Academic Festival took place between August 9 and 14 2015 at the Grillhof Seminar Center in Innsbruck, Austria.

==== Many Peaces Magazine====
The Many Peaces Magazine&lt;ref&gt;http://magazine.manypeaces.org&lt;/ref&gt; was conceptualized and launched in 2014 by Adham Hamed, Mayme Lefurgey, Paul Lauer and Isabelle Guibert. It was created as an outlet to showcase the work of alumni, students, cooperation partners and friends of the Master of Arts Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation and the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies located at Universität Innsbruck, Austria. The magazine is published twice a year, in January and July of each year. The Many Peaces Magazine team has changed and developed over the past volumes and is currently coordinated by a team spread out over three continents and features authors and stories from around the globe. Many of the articles, stories and contributions that can be found in the magazine relate to the field of Peace Studies in some way, but more specifically to the fields of Transrational Peace Philosophy and Elicitive Conflict Transformation.

==Early life==
Ruti grew up in rural [[Finland]] adjacent to the Finland-Russia border. Ruti moved to the US at age 20.&lt;ref&gt;''Penis Envy &amp; Other Bad Feelings'', [[Columbia University Press]], 2018, p. XV&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 2000-2004, Ruti held a lectureship at Harvard’s Program for Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, also serving as the program’s assistant director. She arrived at the University of Toronto in 2004, was tenured in 2008, promoted to full professor in 2013, and promoted to Distinguished Professor in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.provost.utoronto.ca/awards/Distinguished_Professors/Mari_Ruti.htm Mari Ruti] provost.utoronto.ca&lt;/ref&gt; Ruti’s undergraduate courses focus on contemporary theory, literary criticism, cultural studies, film theory, psychoanalysis, trauma theory, and feminist theory. Her English graduate seminars focus on contemporary theory, continental philosophy, psychoanalytic theory, posthumanist ethics, trauma and affect theory. She also teaches the annual graduate seminar on queer theory at The Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies (SDS). This seminar is the core requirement for the SDS Graduate Certificate, and it draws a diverse group of graduate students from both the [[humanities]] and the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sds.utoronto.ca/students/graduate-program/core-courses/ Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies] sds.utoronto.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016-2017, Ruti was Visiting Professor and Director of Graduate Studies at the Harvard Program for Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality.

== Research ==
Ruti’s scholarship addresses questions of subjectivity, relationality, psychic life, desire, affect, power, agency, autonomy, creativity, oppression, social change, and contemporary ethics. Some of her books take a philosophical and contemplative approach, exploring subjective experience, psychic life, self-transformation, and the quest for personal meaning. For example, in ''The Call of Character''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Call-Character-Living-Life-Worth/dp/0231164084/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494186461&amp;sr=1-4 The Call of Character] amazon.com&lt;/ref&gt; she looks at the processes through which individuals develop a distinctive character; how they decide what they most value in life; how they grow through relationships; and how love, loss, hardship, disenchantment, and the necessities of mourning shape the contours of who they are. She has also written extensively on the ethics of the self-other relationship, including the dilemmas generated by the unreadability, unpredictability, and radical vulnerability of others.

Ruti’s more politically oriented scholarship, such as ''Between Levinas and Lacan'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Between-Levinas-Lacan-Other-Ethics/dp/1628926392/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494186326&amp;sr=1-6 Between Levinas and Lacan] amazon.com&lt;/ref&gt; examines questions of social power, oppression, and agency; the impact of social inequalities and collective toxins on psychic and affective life; personal and collective trauma; bad feelings such as anxiety and depression; and the psychic and political processes that allow individuals to cope with adverse circumstances and sometimes even translate pain into personal meaning. She is particularly interested in how subordinated individuals––individuals subjected to poverty, sexism, racism, homophobia, and various personal traumas––come to attain enough critical distance from their surroundings to be able to resist the collective forces that oppress them. For this reason, the complexities of agency, particularly the relationship between subjection and autonomy, have long been central to her scholarship.

Some of Ruti’s politically oriented work is motivated by her background of having grown up in poverty without running water, book learning, or emotional support. She has made a lifelong mission of "working through" this experience in order to lead a livable (and sometimes even a good) life by writing books that address related themes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://logger.believermag.com/post/2012/12/05/desire-is-unquenchable-an-interview-with-mari "Desire is unquenchable" - an interview with Mari Ruti] believermag.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruti’s recent scholarship on feminist and queer theory (in ''Feminist Film Theory and "Pretty Woman"''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Feminist-Theory-Pretty-Woman-Practice/dp/1501319469/ref=sr_1_9?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494186461&amp;sr=1-9 Feminist Film Theory and "Pretty Woman"] amazon.com&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Ethics of Opting Out''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Ethics-Opting-Out-Theorys-Subjects/dp/0231180918/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494186461&amp;sr=1-1 The Ethics of Opting Out] amazon.com&lt;/ref&gt;) investigates [[biopolitics]]; [[neoliberalism]]; [[postfeminism]]; contemporary ideals of femininity; new forms of [[heteropatriarchy]]; female self-objectification; queer antinormativity; queer negativity/pessimism; queer utopianism/optimism; queer discourses of failure and bad feelings; the relationship between queer theory and affect theory; and ethical debates within queer theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.provost.utoronto.ca/awards/Distinguished_Professors/Mari_Ruti.htm Mari Ruti] provost.utoronto.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marjorie Cameron Parsons Kimmel''' (April 23, 1922 – June 24, 1995), who professionally used the [[mononym]] '''Cameron''', was an American artist, poet, actress, and [[occultist]]. A follower of [[Thelema]], the [[new religious movement]] established by the English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], she was married to rocket pioneer and fellow Thelemite [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]].

Born in [[Belle Plaine, Iowa]], Cameron volunteered for services in the [[United States Navy]] during the [[Second World War]], after which she settled in [[Pasadena, California]]. There she met Parsons, who believed her to be the "elemental" woman that he had invoked in the early stages of a series of [[sex magic]] rituals called the [[Babalon Working]]. They entered into a relationship and were married in 1946. Their relationship was often strained, although Parsons sparked her involvement in Thelema and occultism. After Parsons' death in an explosion at their home in 1952, Cameron came to suspect that her husband had been assassinated and began rituals to communicate with his spirit. Moving to [[Beaumont, California|Beaumont]], she established a multi-racial occult group called The Children, which dedicated itself to sex magical rituals with the intent of producing mixed-race "moon children" who would be devoted to the god [[Horus]]. The group soon dissolved, largely because many of its members became concerned by Cameron's increasingly [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] predictions.

Returning to [[Los Angeles]], Cameron befriended the socialite [[Samson De Brier]] and established herself within the city's avant-garde artistic community. Among her friends were the filmmakers [[Curtis Harrington]] and [[Kenneth Anger]]. She appeared in two of Harrington's films, ''The Wormwood Star'' and ''[[Night Tide]]'', as well as in Anger's film ''[[Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome]]''. In later years, she made appearances in art-house films created by [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]] and [[Chick Strand]]. Rarely remaining in one place for long, during the 1950s and 1960s she lived in [[Joshua Tree, California|Joshua Tree]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. In 1955, she gave birth to a daughter, Crystal Eve Kimmel. Although intermittent health problems prevented her from working, her art and poetry resulted in several exhibitions. From the late 1970s until her death from [[cancer]] in 1995, Cameron lived in a bungalow in [[West Hollywood]], where she raised her daughter and grandchildren, pursued her interests in esotericism, and produced artwork and poetry.

Cameron's recognition as an artist increased after her death, when her paintings made appearances in exhibitions across the U.S. As a result of increased attention on Parsons, Cameron's life also gained greater coverage in the early 2000s. In 2006, the Cameron–Parsons Foundation was created to preserve and promote her work, and in 2011 a biography of Cameron written by Spencer Kansa was published.

==Biography==

===Early life: 1922–1945===
Cameron was born in [[Belle Plaine, Iowa]], on April 23, 1922.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=131|2a1=Duncan|2y=2008|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=538|4a1=Kansa|4y=2011|4p=9|5a1=Laden|5y=2014}} Her father, railway worker Hill Leslie Cameron, was the adopted child of a Scots-Irish family; her mother, Carrie Cameron (''née'' Ridenour), was of Dutch ancestry.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=131|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=538|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3pp=9–11}} She was their first child, and was followed by three siblings: James (b. 1923), Mary (b. 1927), and Robert (b. 1929).{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=11–12}} They lived on the wealthier north side of town, although life was nevertheless hard due to the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=12, 15}} Cameron attended Whittier Elementary School and Belle Plaine High School, where she did well at art, English, and drama but failed algebra, Latin, and civics lessons. She also participated in athletics, glee club, and chorus.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=13–14}} Relating that one of her childhood friends had committed suicide and that she too had contemplated it, she characterized herself as a rebellious child, claiming that "I became the town pariah&amp;nbsp;... Nobody would let their kid near me".{{sfn|Laden|2014}} She had sexual relationships with various men; after Cameron became pregnant, her mother performed an illegal home [[abortion]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=17}} In 1940, the Cameron family relocated to [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]] so Hill could work at the [[Rock Island Arsenal]] munitions factory. Cameron completed her final year of high school education at [[Davenport Central High School|Davenport High School]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=18}} Leaving school, she worked as a display artist in a local department store.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=18}}

Following the United States' entry into the [[Second World War]], Cameron signed up for the [[Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service]], a part of the [[United States Navy]], in February 1943. Initially sent to a training camp at [[Iowa State Teachers College]] in [[Cedar Falls, Iowa|Cedar Falls]], she was subsequently posted to [[Washington D.C.]], where she served as a cartographer for the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. In the course of these duties, she met U.K. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in May 1943.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=131|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=538|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3pp=18–22|4a1=Nelson|4y=2014|5a1=Laden|5y=2014}} She was reassigned to the Naval Photographic Unit in [[Anacostia]], where she worked as a [[Wardrobe supervisor|wardrobe mistress]] for propaganda documentaries, and during this period met various [[Hollywood]] stars.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=22–23}} When her brother James returned to the U.S. injured from service overseas, she went [[AWOL]] and returned to Iowa to see him, as a result of which she was [[Court-martial|court–martialed]] and confined to barracks for the rest of the war.{{sfnm|1a1=Duncan|1y=2008|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=538|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3p=24}} For reasons unknown to her, she received an honorable discharge from the military in 1945. To join her family, she traveled to [[Pasadena, California]], where her father and brothers had found work at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL).{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=131|2a1=Duncan|2y=2008|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=538|4a1=Kansa|4y=2011|4p=27|5a1=Nelson|5y=2014|6a1=Laden|6y=2014}}

===Jack Parsons: 1946–1952===
[[File:Jack Parsons 2.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Jack Parsons, Cameron's husband|alt=A young white male with dark hair, facing the camera. The image is in black and white.]]

In Pasadena, Cameron ran into a former colleague, who invited her to visit the large [[American Craftsman]]-style house where he was currently lodging, 1003 Orange Grove Avenue, also known as "The Parsonage". The house was so-called because its lease was owned by [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]], a rocket scientist who had been a founding member of the JPL and who was also a devout follower of [[Thelema]], a [[new religious movement]] founded by English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] in 1904. Parsons was the head of the Agape Lodge, a branch of the Thelemite [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (OTO).{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=130|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2pp=28–29|3a1=Nelson|3y=2014|4a1=Laden|4y=2014}} Unbeknownst to Cameron, Parsons had just finished a series of rituals using [[Enochian magic]] with his friend and lodger [[L. Ron Hubbard]], all with the intent of attracting an "elemental" woman to be his lover. Upon encountering Cameron with her distinctive red hair and blue eyes, Parsons considered her to be the individual whom he had invoked.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=130|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=259–260|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3pp=35–37|4a1=Nelson|4y=2014|5a1=Laden|5y=2014}} After they met at The Parsonage on January 18, 1946, they were instantly attracted to each other and spent the next two weeks in Parsons' bedroom together. Although Cameron was unaware of it, Parsons saw this as a form of [[sex magic]] that constituted part of the [[Babalon Working]], a rite to invoke the birth of Thelemite goddess [[Babalon]] onto Earth in human form.{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1pp=263–264|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2p=29|3a1=Laden|3y=2014}}

During a brief visit to New York City to see a friend, Cameron discovered that she was pregnant and decided to have an abortion.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=151|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2pp=37–38}} Parsons meanwhile had founded a company with Hubbard and Hubbard's girlfriend [[Sara Northrup]], Allied Enterprises, into which he invested his life savings. It became apparent that Hubbard was a confidence trickster, who tried to flee with Parsons' money, resulting in the end of their friendship.{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1pp=267–269 |2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2pp=38–39}} Returning to Pasadena, Cameron consoled Parsons, painting a picture of Northrup with her legs severed below the knee.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=39}} Parsons decided to sell The Parsonage, which was then demolished for redevelopment, and the couple moved to [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]]. On October 19, 1946, he and Cameron married at the [[San Juan Capistrano, California|San Juan Capistrano]] courthouse in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], in a service witnessed by his best friend Edward Forman.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=320|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2p=158|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3pp=275, 277|4a1=Kansa|4y=2011|4p=39|5a1=Laden|5y=2014}} Having an aversion to all religion, Cameron initially took no interest in Parsons' Thelemite beliefs and occult practices, although he maintained that she had an important destiny, giving her the magical name of "Candida", often shortened to "Candy", which became her nickname.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=130|2a1=Duncan|2y=2008|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3pp=39–41}}

[[File:Aleister Crowley.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cameron embraced the ideas of English occultist Aleister Crowley (pictured).|alt=A bald, middle-aged white man staring straight at the viewer.]]

In the winter of 1947, Cameron travelled from New York to Paris aboard the ''SS America'' with the intention of studying art at the [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]], which she hoped would admit her with a letter of recommendation from Pasadena's [[Art Center College of Design|Art Center School]]. She also wanted to visit England and meet with Crowley and explain to him Parsons' Babalon Working.  Cameron learned upon her arrival in Paris that Crowley had died and that she had not been admitted to the college. She found post-war Paris "extreme and bleak", befriended [[Juliette Gréco]], and spent three weeks in Switzerland before returning home.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=43–45}} When Cameron developed [[catalepsy]], Parsons suggested that she read [[Sylvan Muldoon]]'s books on [[astral projection]] and encouraged her to read [[James Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', [[Heinrich Zimmer]]'s ''The King and the Corpse'', and [[Joseph Campbell]]'s ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=48–49}} Although she still did not accept Thelema, she became increasingly interested in the occult, and in particular the use of the [[tarot]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=48–49}}

Parsons' and Cameron's relationship was deteriorating and they contemplated divorce.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=48}} While Cameron visited the artistic commune at [[San Miguel de Allende]] in Mexico and befriended the artist [[Renate Druks]], Parsons moved into a house in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] and was involved in a brief relationship with an Irishwoman named Gladis Gohan before Cameron returned.{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1p=288|2a1=Duncan|2y=2008|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3pp=51–53|4a1=Nelson|4y=2014|5a1=Laden|5y=2014}} By March 1951, Parsons and Cameron had moved to the coach house at 1071 South Orange Grove, while he began work at the Bermite Powder Company, constructing explosives for the film industry.{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1pp=294, 297|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2p=57}} They started holding parties once more that were attended largely by [[Bohemianism|bohemians]] and members of the [[beat generation]], and Cameron attended the jazz clubs of Central Avenue with her friend, the sculptor [[Julie Macdonald]].{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1pp=294–295|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2pp=57–63}} Cameron produced illustrations for fashion magazines and sold some of her paintings, including some purchased by a friend, the artist [[Jirayr Zorthian]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=61}} Parsons and Cameron had decided to travel to Mexico for a few months.{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1pp=296–297|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2p=64}} On the day before they planned to leave—June 17, 1952—he received a rush order of explosives for a film set, and began work on the order at his house.{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1p=299|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2p=65}} In the midst of this project, an explosion destroyed the building, fatally wounding Parsons. He was rushed to hospital, but was declared dead.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=177–179|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=1–6|3a1=Duncan|3y=2008|4a1=Kansa|4y=2011|4pp=65–66|5a1=Laden|5y=2014}} Cameron did not want to see his body and retreated to San Miguel, asking her friend George Frey to oversee the cremation.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=67–68}}

===The Children, Kenneth Anger, and Curtis Harrington: 1952–1968===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="In medical language Cameron is a lunatic. Elementals and forces and ideas like Babalon when uncontrolled are dangerous. She is now uncontrolled because Jack is dead.

While in Mexico, Cameron began performing blood rituals in the hope of communicating with Parsons' spirit; during these, she cut her own wrists. As part of these rituals, she claimed to have received a new magical identity, Hilarion.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=74}} When she learned that an [[unidentified flying object]] had been seen over Washington D.C.'s [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]] she considered it a response to Parsons' death.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=74}} After two months, she returned to California and attempted suicide.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=74–75}} Increasingly interested in occultism, she read through her husband's papers. Embracing his Thelemic beliefs, she came to understand his purpose in carrying out the Babalon Working and also came to believe that the spirit of Babalon had been incarnated into herself.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=75–77}} She came to believe that Parsons had been murdered by the police or [[anti-Zionism|anti-zionists]], and continued her attempts at astral projection to commune with his spirit.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=77–79}}

Her mental stability was deteriorating, and she became convinced that a nuclear test on [[Eniwetok Atoll]] would result in the destruction of the California coast.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=79}} There is inconclusive evidence that she was institutionalized in a psychiatric ward during this period, before having a brief affair with African-American jazz player [[Leroy Booth]], a relationship that would have been illegal at the time.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=80–81}} At some point in this period, she stayed with the Thelemite [[Wilfred Talbot Smith]] and his wife,{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=328|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2p=184}} although he thought that she had "bats in the belfry" and ignored what he described as her "Mad Mental Meanderings".{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=328}}

In December 1952 Cameron moved to a derelict ranch in [[Beaumont, California|Beaumont]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kansa|1y=2011|1p=82|2a1=Nelson|2y=2014|3a1=Laden|3y=2014}} With the aid of Druks and Paul Mathison, she gathered a loose clique of magical practitioners around herself which she called "The Children". Intentionally comprising members from various  races, she oversaw a range of sex magic rituals with the intent of creating a breed of mixed-race "moonchildren" who would be devoted to [[Horus]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=85–86}} She became pregnant as a result of these rites, and termed her forthcoming child "the Wormwood Star", although the pregnancy ended in [[miscarriage]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=67, 97}} Over time, many of Cameron's associates within The Children distanced themselves from her, in particular because of her increasingly apocalyptic pronouncements; she claimed that Mexico was about to conquer the U.S., that a [[race war]] was about to break out in the [[Old World]], and that a comet would hit the Earth, and that a [[flying saucer]] would rescue her and her followers and take them to [[Mars]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=90, 92}} During her magical rituals she used a range of drugs, including [[marijuana]], [[peyote]], and [[magic mushrooms]], and in June 1953 she visited Los Angeles to attend a [[Gerald Heard]] lecture on the mind-expanding uses of hallucinogens.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=88–89}} Perhaps because of her drug use, Cameron was suffering from auditory hallucinations, frequent bouts of depression, and dramatic mood swings.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=90, 91, 92}} During this period, she corresponded with the Thelemite [[Jane Wolfe]],{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=188|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2pp=82–84|3a1=Nelson|3y=2014}} although other Thelemites and Crowley associates such as [[Karl Germer]] and [[Gerald Yorke]] deemed her insane.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=92, 94}}

[[File:Cameron's The Black Egg.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cameron's self-portrait, ''The Black Egg'', was placed at the centre of an altar during Cameron's 1995 memorial service.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=253}}|alt=A painting of a slim white woman with large red hair.

After using the Chinese [[divination]] text the ''[[I Ching]]'', Cameron returned to Los Angeles, moving in with Booth until the duo were arrested for illegal drug possession.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=97–98}} Released on bail, she moved into Druks' Malibu home, and through her joined the avant-garde artistic circle surrounding the socialite [[Samson De Brier]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=100}} It was through this circle that Cameron met the Thelemite film maker [[Kenneth Anger]], and after a party titled "Come As Your Madness" which was organised by Mathison and Druks, he decided to produce a film featuring Cameron and others in the group. The resulting film was ''[[Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Landis|1y=1995|1pp=74–76|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2p=190|3a1=Duncan|3y=2008|4a1=Kansa|4y=2011|4pp=104–106|5a1=Laden|5y=2014}} After seeing the film, the English Thelemite [[Kenneth Grant]] wrote to Cameron hoping that she might move to England and join his London-based group, the New Isis Lodge; Cameron never responded.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=114–115}}

Through common friends Cameron met Sheridan "Sherry" Kimmel, and the two entered a relationship. A veteran of the Second World War from [[Florida]], Kimmel suffered from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], often causing him severe mood swings. He developed an interest in occultism and became intensely jealous of Parsons' continuing influence over Cameron, destroying Parsons' notes on the Babalon Working that she had kept.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=190|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2pp=118–121|3a1=Nelson|3y=2014}} Cameron again became pregnant, although was unsure who the father was; she gave birth to a daughter, Crystal Eve Kimmel, on [[Christmas Eve]] 1955.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=190|2a1=Duncan|2y=2008|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3pp=126, 130|4a1=Nelson|4y=2014|5a1=Laden|5y=2014}} She allowed her daughter to behave how she pleased, believing that that was the best way for to learn.{{sfnm|1a1=Kansa|1y=2011|1p=47|2a1=Laden|2y=2014}} With her friend, the film-maker [[Curtis Harrington]], Cameron then produced a short film, ''The Wormwood Star'', which was filmed at the home of multi-millionaire art collector [[Edward James]]; the film features images of Cameron's paintings, and recitations of her poems.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=191|2a1=Duncan|2y=2008|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3pp=135–139|4a1=Nelson|4y=2014|5a1=Laden|5y=2014}}

In autumn 1956 Cameron's first exhibition was held, at [[Walter Hopp]]'s studio in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]]; several paintings were destroyed when the gallery caught fire.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=131}} Around this time, Cameron was introduced to the actor [[Dean Stockwell]] at a public recital of her poetry; he then introduced her to his friend and fellow actor [[Dennis Hopper]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=140–141}} She was also an associate of the artist [[Wallace Berman]], who used a photograph of her on the front of the first volume of his art journal, ''Semina''. The volume also included Cameron's drawing, ''Peyote Vision''.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=121–122}} This artwork was featured in Berman's 1957 exhibition at Los Angeles' Feris Gallery, which was raided and shut down by the police. Investigating officers claimed that ''Peyote Vision'', which featured two copulating figures, was pornographic and indecent, thus legitimising their actions.{{sfnm|1a1=Kansa|1y=2011|1p=141|2a1=Fredman|2y=2010|2p=1}}

In late 1957, Cameron moved to [[San Francisco]] with her friends Norman Rose and David Metzer.{{sfnm|1a1=Kansa|1y=2011|1p=144|2a1=Nelson|2y=2014}} There she mingled within the same bohemian social circles as many of the beat generation of artists and writers, and was a regular at avant-garde poetry readings.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=143, 150}} She began a relationship with the artist [[Burt Shonberg]], and with him moved into a ranch outside of [[Joshua Tree, California|Joshua Tree]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kansa|1y=2011|1pp=152–154, 157|2a1=Nelson|2y=2014}} Together they began exploring the subject of [[Ufology]], and became friends with the ufologist [[George Van Tassel]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=157–158}} After Kimmel was released from a psychiatric ward, Cameron re-established her relationship with him, and in 1959 they were married in a civil ceremony at Santa Monica City Hall; their relationship was strained and they separated soon after.{{sfnm|1a1=Kansa|1y=2011|1pp=173–174|2a1=Laden|2y=2014}}

In 1960, Cameron appeared alongside Hopper in Harrington's first full-length film, ''[[Night Tide]]''. The film was a critical success and—despite not receiving a wide distribution—became a [[cult film|cult classic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=191|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2pp=174–171|3a1=Nelson|3y=2014|4a1=Laden|4y=2014}} She was  invited to appear in Harrington's next film, ''[[Games (film)|Games]]'', although ultimately never did so.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=207}} After Cameron moved to [[Venice, Los Angeles]],{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=174}} a local arts shop exhibited her work in August 1961.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=177}} On his return to the U.S. from Europe, Anger moved in with Cameron for a time,{{sfnm|1a1=Landis|1y=1995|1pp=100–101|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2pp=183–187}} before the duo moved into a flat on Silverlake Boulevard in early 1964; Anger remained there before departing for New York City.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=190}} According to Anger biographer Bill Landis, Cameron had become "a rather formidable maternal figure" in Anger's life.{{sfn|Landis|1995|p=81}} In October 1964, the Cinema Theatre in Los Angeles held an event known as The Transcendental Art of Cameron, which displayed her art and poetry and screened some of her films; Anger arrived and disrupted the event by objecting to the screening of ''Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome'' without his permission.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=191–192}} He then launched a poster campaign, ''The Cameron File'', against his former friend, labelling her "Typhoid Mary of the Occult World".{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=193–194}} The pair later reconciled, Cameron visiting Anger in San Francisco, where he introduced her to [[Anton LaVey]], the founder of the [[Church of Satan]]. LaVey was delighted to meet her, having been a fan of ''Night Tide''.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=214}}

===Later life: 1969–1995===

[[File:Seridan Kimmel's grave.jpg|thumb|right|The grave of Cameron's partner Sheridan Kimmel at Lakeside Memorial in Doral, Florida]]

In the latter part of the 1960s, Cameron and her daughter moved to the [[pueblos]] of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]],{{sfnm|1a1=Duncan|1y=2008|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2p=215|3a1=Laden|3y=2014}} where she developed a friendship with the sculptor [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]] and appeared in his art movie, ''Thumb Suck'', which was never released.{{sfnm|1a1=Duncan|1y=2008|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2pp=217–218|3a1=Laden|3y=2014}} It was also while in New Mexico that she suffered a [[collapsed lung]] and required hospitalization.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=226–227}} Her wider health was poor, as she suffered from chronic bronchitis and [[emphysema]]—which were both exacerbated by her chain smoking—while hand tremors prevented her from being able to paint for four years.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=227}}
Returning to California, by 1969 she was living in the Pioneertown sector of Joshua Tree.{{sfnm|1a1=Kansa|1y=2011|1pp=223–224|2a1=Nelson|2y=2014}} From there she and her daughter moved to a small bungalow on North Genesee Avenue in the [[West Hollywood]] area of Los Angeles, which at the time had become impoverished and associated with crime, [[sex shop|sex stores]], and [[adult movie theatre]]s; she remained there for the rest of her life.{{sfnm|1a1=Kansa|1y=2011|1p=227|2a1=Nelson|2y=2014}}

By the mid-1980s, Cameron was focusing to a greater extent on her family life, particularly in looking after her grandchildren, who were known to go [[Joyride (crime)|joyriding]] in her jeep.{{sfnm|1a1=Kansa|1y=2011|1p=238|2a1=Laden|2y=2014}} Neighbors recall her playing a [[Celtic harp]] in her garden and slowly walking her dog around the block while smoking a joint of marijuana.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=244}} At one point, she was arrested for cultivating cannabis in her home.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=233–234}} Cameron became a regular practitioner of [[Tai chi]], took part in group sessions in [[Bronson Park]] under the tutelage of [[Marshall Ho'o]], and earned a teaching certificate in the subject.{{sfnm|1a1=Kansa|1y=2011|1p=236|2a1=Laden|2y=2014}} She became very interested in [[José Argüelles]]' ''[[The Mayan Factor]]'' and [[Charles Musès]]' ''[[The Lion Path]]'', and undertook the [[Neoshamanism|Neo-shamanic]] practices endorsed in the latter.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=241}} She was also influenced by claims made in the writings of archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]] about a prehistoric [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] society devoted to a goddess.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=247}} Cameron was very interested in [[A. S. Raleigh]]'s ''[[Woman and Superwoman]]'', taped her own reading of it, and sent copies to her friends and local public radio for broadcast.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=247}} Throughout all of these disparate spiritual interests, she retained faith in the Thelemic ideas of Crowley.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=247}}

As well as entertaining old friends who came to visit her in her home,{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=242}} Cameron also met with younger occultists, such as the Thelemite [[William Breeze]] and the [[industrial music]]ian [[Genesis P-Orridge]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=239}} Cameron aided Breeze in co-editing a collection of Parsons' occult and [[libertarianism|libertarian]] writings, which were published as ''Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword'' in 1989.{{sfnm|1a1=Duncan|1y=2008|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2p=249|3a1=Nelson|3y=2014}} Cameron was acquainted with the experimental film-maker [[Chick Strand]] and appeared in the latter's 1979 project ''Loose Ends'', during which she narrated the story of an [[exorcism]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=233–234}} In 1989, an exhibition of her work titled ''The Pearl of Reprisal'' was held at the [[Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery]]. It included a selection of her paintings and a screening of ''Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome'' and ''The Wormwood Star'', while Cameron attended to provide a candle-lit reading of her poetry.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=195|2a1=Duncan|2y=2008|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3p=249|4a1=Laden|4y=2014}} In the mid-1990s, Cameron was diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]] and underwent [[radiotherapy]] treatment, which she supplemented with [[alternative medicine]]s. The tumor was [[cancer]]ous and metastasized to her lungs.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=250, 253}} She died at the age of 73 in the [[VA Medical Center]] on July 24, 1995,{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=195|2a1=Duncan|2y=2008|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3p=252|4a1=Laden|4y=2014}} and underwent the Thelemic last rites, carried out by a high priestess of the Ordo Templi Orientis.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=253}} Her body was [[cremation|cremated]] and its ashes were scattered in the [[Mojave Desert]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=253}} A memorial event was held at Venice's [[Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center]] in August.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=253}}

==Personality==
Cameron preferred to be known by her surname as a mononym.{{sfn|Lunenfeld|2015|p=91}} According to historian of Thelema Martin P. Starr, Cameron's "very dominating personality could not brook rivals of any kind".{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=320}} The fashion writer [[Tim Blanks]] noted that Cameron was "a charismatic woman" active in the mid-twentieth century "macho art world", and that it was not surprising how "alluring and dangerous" she must have seemed to Hopper and Stockwell.{{sfn|Blanks|2013|p=246}}

Stockwell described Cameron as "a very, very intense personality, but very fascinating".{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=141}} Considering her to be "an out and out witch",{{sfn|Landis|1995|p=72}} Hopper described her as having an "infectious personality" through her presence; she was someone "that you knew [was] different and [she] had a magnetic quality that you wanted to be closer to".{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=141}}
The photographer [[Charles Brittin]], who knew Cameron on Los Angeles' artistic circuit, called her "a sweet person with a great personality, not the way some of her friends wanted to picture her to be".{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=178}} Her friend Shirley Berman described her as having "many different crowds of friends, and I think she was a different personality with each crowd&amp;nbsp;... She wasn't an even personality at all, but she was always a very gracious person."{{sfn|Laden|2014}}

==Artistic style==
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="[Cameron's] art and spiritual life were one. They were indivisible&amp;nbsp;... But that said, you can be a total sceptic or atheist, or know nothing of her spiritual practice, and still be deeply moved or blown away by her exquisitely rendered, and beautiful envisioned drawings and paintings. It's the work that remains. These sublime treasures that she seems to have captured and brought back from a netherworld for us all to view."|source=– Biographer Spencer Kansa.{{sfn|Stevens|2011|p=25}}}}

The digital media theorist [[Peter Lunenfeld]] described Cameron as "one of those people for whom art was life and life was art", and thus an understanding of her life is needed to appreciate her work.{{sfn|Lunenfeld|2015|p=91}} Cameron's occult beliefs strongly affected her artworks.{{sfnm|1a1=Laden|1y=2014|2a1=Martinez|2y=2015}} According to Priscilla Frank, writing for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', Cameron's artwork merges "Crowley's occult with the surrealism and symbolism of French poets, yielding dark yet whimsical depictions buzzing with otherworldly power".{{sfn|Frank|2014}} The art curator [[Philippe Vergne]] described her work as being on "the edge of surrealism and psychedelia", embodying "an aspect of modernity that deeply doubts and defies cartesian logic at a moment in history when these values have shown their own limitations".{{sfn|Frank|2014}}

Lunenfeld compared Cameron's black and white pen-and-ink drawings to those of the English artist [[Aubrey Beardsley]], noting that she was capable of a "ferocious, paradoxical line work—simultaneously precise and seductively unrestrained—that functions as both figurative depiction and unabashed emotional talisman".{{sfn|Lunenfeld|2015|p=92}} He believed that both "passion and craft" could be seen in her draughtsmanship, but that it also displayed "a guilelessness that is hard to relate to in our post post-ironic moment".{{sfn|Lunenfeld|2015|p=92}} He also discussed her lost multi-coloured watercolour paintings that were featured in Harrington's ''The Wormwood Star'', suggesting that they were akin to a [[storyboard]] for an unrealised film by the director [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]].{{sfn|Lunenfeld|2015|p=92}}

Cameron's biographer Spencer Kansa was of the opinion that Cameron exhibited parallels with the Australian artist and occultist [[Rosaleen Norton]], both in terms of her physical appearance and the similarities between their artistic styles.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=137}} Harrington also saw similarities in the work of Cameron and the artists [[Leonora Carrington]] and [[Leonor Fini]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=136, 137}} On the website of the Cameron–Parsons Foundation, Michael Duncan expressed the view that Cameron's work rivals that of "fellow surrealists" like Carrington, Fini, [[Remedios Varo]], and [[Ithell Colquhoun]], while also appearing "fascinatingly prescient" of the works by later artists [[Kiki Smith]], [[Amy Cutler]], [[Karen Kilimmck]], and [[Hernan Bas]].{{sfn|Duncan|2008}}
In later years, Cameron would often be erroneously labelled a [[Beat Generation|Beat artist]] because she inhabited many of the same social circles as prominent Beat poets and writers.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=143}} Rejecting this label, Kansa instead described Cameron as "a pre-Beat bohemian, whose heart lay in Romanticism".{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=143}}

==Legacy==

Cameron's reputation as an artist grew after her death.{{sfnm|1a1=Kansa|1y=2011|1p=255|2a1=Laden|2y=2014}} In 2006, her friend Scott Hobbs established the Cameron–Parsons Foundation to serve as an archive storing and promoting her work.{{sfn|Laden|2014}} In 1995, her painting ''Peyote Vision'' was included as part of an exhibition on "Beat Culture and the New American" held at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in New York City.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=195|2a1=Duncan|2y=2008|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3p=255}} Some of her artworks were then exhibited alongside those of Crowley and other Thelemites for the 2001 exhibition "Reflections of a New Aeon", held at the Eleven Seven Gallery in California's [[Long Beach]].{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=256}} In 2007 a retrospective of Cameron's work was held at the Nicole Klagsbrun Gallery in New York City's Chelsea district, while that same year some of her works appeared in the traveling exhibition "Semina Culture", which was devoted to all of the artists who contributed to Wallace Berman's journal.{{sfnm|1a1=Duncan|1y=2008|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2pp=257–258|3a1=Laden|3y=2014}} In 2008, her painting ''Dark Angel'' was featured in the "Traces du Sacré" exhibit at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris.{{sfn|Blanks|2013|p=246}} In 2014, another retrospective, titled "Cameron: Songs for the Witch Woman", was held at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]].{{sfnm|1a1=Nelson|1y=2014|2a1=Laden|2y=2014}} That year, the U.K.-based publisher Fulgur Esoterica released a book featuring images of Cameron's artworks and Parsons' poems.{{sfnm|1a1=Frank|1y=2014|2a1=Laden|2y=2014}} In 2015, a retrospective of her work titled "Cameron: Cinderella of the Wastelands" was held at the [[Deitch Projects]] in Soho, New York City, which included an evening in which friends of Cameron's assembled to publicly discuss her legacy.{{sfnm|1a1=Yaeger|1y=2015|2a1=Chidester|2y=2015|3a1=Martinez|3y=2015}} Cameron's aesthetic also influenced the fashion world, designers [[Pamela Skaist-Levy]] and [[Gela Nash-Taylor]] acknowledging Cameron as a partial inspiration for their Skaist-Taylor label.{{sfn|Blanks|2013|p=246}}

Cameron's life was brought to wider attention through the publication of two biographies about Parsons: John Carter's ''Sex and Rockets'' and George Pendle's ''Strange Angel''.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=255}} A dramatization of Parsons' life was depicted in the play ''Moonchild'', performed at [[The Access Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2004. Cameron was portrayed by Heather Tom.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|p=257}} In 2011, ''Wormwood Star'', a biography of Cameron authored by the Briton Spencer Kansa, was published,{{sfnm|1a1=Stevens|1y=2011|1p=24|2a1=Blanks|2y=2013|2p=246}} though it was not authorized by the Cameron–Parsons Foundation.{{sfn|Nelson|2014}} Kansa had spent almost three years in the U.S. researching the book, interviewing many of those who knew Cameron, including several who died shortly after.{{sfn|Stevens|2011|p=24}} Kansa stated that most of those whom he interviewed "were immensely generous with their time and recollections" but that "one of Cameron's kookier friends" had begun making claims that Kansa was not a biographer but was really an agent of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].{{sfn|Stevens|2011|p=24}} Writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'', Steffie Nelson noted that Kansa did "his due diligence tracking down Cameron's childhood acquaintances and friends" but at the same time was critical of the lack of sources or footnotes.{{sfn|Nelson|2014}}

'''Mark Rowlands''' (born 1962) is a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] writer and philosopher. He is Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Miami]], and the author of several books on the philosophy of mind, the moral status of [[Animal rights|non-human animals]], and cultural criticism. He is known within academic philosophy for his work on the animal mind and is one of the principal architects of the view known as vehicle [[externalism]], or the [[extended mind]], the view that thoughts, memories, desires and belies can be stored outside the brain and the skull. His works include ''Animal Rights'' (1998), ''The Body in Mind'' (1999), ''The Nature of Consciousness'' (2001), ''Animals Like Us'' (2002), and a personal memoir, ''The Philosopher and the Wolf'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.as.miami.edu/phi/people/faculty.html "Faculty"], Department of Philosophy, University of Miami. Retrieved 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowlands was born in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], Wales and began his undergraduate degree in engineering at the [[University of Manchester]] before changing to philosophy. He took his doctorate in philosophy from the [[University of Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowlands|first=Mark|year=1989|title=Anomalism, supervenience, and explanation in cognitive psychology|url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:d22daaac-1094-424e-91ce-dc39e9da644f|journal=Oxford Research Archive|language=en|publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has held various academic positions in philosophy in Britain, Ireland and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.markrowlandsauthor.com/ "Mark Rowlands"], markrowlandsauthor.com. Retrieved 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

His best known work is his international best-selling memoir, ''The Philosopher and the Wolf'', about the decade he spent living and travelling with a wolf. As [[Jonathan Derbyshire]] wrote in his ''Guardian'' review, "it is perhaps best described as the autobiography of an idea, or rather a set of related ideas, about the relationship between human and non-human animals."&lt;ref&gt;Derbyshire, Jonathan. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/29/philosopher-wolf-mark-rowlands 'Wild about the wolf'], ''The Guardian'', 29 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Baggini]] wrote in the ''Financial Times'' that it was "a remarkable portrait of the bond that can exist between a human being and a beast."&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian Baggini|Baggini, Julian]].

'''Metadiscourse''' is a term that is used in [[philosophy]] to denote a discussion about a discussion (and so on), as opposed to a simple discussion about a given topic.

The term '''metadiscourse''' is also used in writing to describe a word or phrase that comments on what is in the sentence, usually as an introductory [[adverbial clause]].  It is any phrase that is included within a clause or sentence that goes beyond the subject itself, often to examine the purpose of the sentence or a response from the author. Metadiscourse includes phrases such as "frankly," "after all," "on the other hand," "to our surprise," and so on.

Below are some examples of metadiscourse in writing, denoting:
* the writer's intentions: ''"to sum up," "candidly," "I believe"''
* the writer's confidence: ''"may," "perhaps," "certainly," "must"''
* directions to the reader: ''"note that," "finally," "therefore," "however"''
* the structure of the text: ''"first," "second," "finally," "therefore," "however"''

You can find some information and events related to [http://www.metadiscourseacrossgenres.com/ Metadiscourse Across Genres by visiting MAG 2017 website].

Most writing needs metadiscourse, but too much buries ideas. Technical, academic, and other non-fiction writers should use metadiscourse sparingly.&lt;ref&gt;M. Joseph Williams: ''Style: the Basics of Clarity and Grace''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2986">A '''pantomath''' is a person who wants to know and knows everything. The word itself is not to be found in common online English dictionaries, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]'', dictionaries of obscure words, or dictionaries of [[neologism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onelook.com/?w=pantomath&amp;scwo=1&amp;sswo=1 "pantomath" @ OneLook.com] - metasearch across 1,000+ dictionaries returns no hits other than this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Logic dictates that there are no literal nonfictional pantomaths, but the word pantomath seems to have been used to imply a [[polymath]] in a superlative sense, a ''[[ne plus ultra]]'' ("nothing more beyond") as it were, one who satisfies requirements even stricter than those to be applied to the polymath. In theory, a pantomath is not to be confused with a polymath in its less strict sense, much less with the related but very different terms [[philomath]] and [[know-it-all]].

== Etymology ==
{{unsourced section|date=July 2016}}
A pantomath (''pantomathēs'', παντομαθής, meaning "having learnt all", from the [[Greek language|Greek]] roots παντ- "all", "every" and the root μαθ-, meaning "learning", "understanding") is a person whose astonishingly wide interests and knowledge span the entire range of the arts and sciences.

== Uses ==
Pantomath is typically used to convey the sense that a great individual has achieved a pinnacle of learning, that an "automath" has taken [[autodidacticism]] to an endpoint. As an example, the obscure and rare term seems to have been applied to those with an astonishingly wide knowledge and interests by these two authors from different eras: [[G. M. Young]] has been called a pantomath,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Kevin. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20040711/ai_n12757309 Cover Story: Clever is as clever does], ''The Independent'', 11 July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; as has [[Rupert Hart-Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lhdletters.inwriting.org/annos1.shtml Lyttleton Letters Annos I]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a critical view, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s monumental breadth of knowledge and accomplishments, together with his serene, supernal wisdom, a wisdom which has been described as aloof,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bartelby.com/65/go/Goethe-J.html&lt;/ref&gt; even inhuman,&lt;ref&gt;http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9108453/Goethe{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; made him worthy of the denomination [[wikt:Olympian|Olympian]].

'''Perfection''' is a state, variously, of completeness, flawlessness, or supreme excellence. 

The [[terminology|term]] is used to designate a range of diverse, if often kindred, [[concept]]s. These have historically been addressed in a number of discrete [[academic discipline|discipline]]s, notably [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], [[ontology]], and [[theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''O doskonałości'' (On Perfection), 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Term and concept==
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Aristotle]].]]
The form of the word long fluctuated in various languages. The [[English language]] had the alternates, "perfection" and the [[Bible|Biblical]] "perfectness."&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p5&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Perfection: the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "perfection" derives from the [[Latin]] "''[[w:la:perfectio|perfectio]]''", and "perfect" — from "''[[w:la:perfectus|perfectus]]''". These expressions in turn come from "''[[w:la:perficio|perficio]]''" — "to finish", "to bring to an end." "''Perfectio''(n)" thus literally means "a finishing", and "perfect''(us)''" — "finished", much as in [[grammar|grammatical]] parlance ("[[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]").&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p5 /&gt;

Many modern languages have adopted their terms for the concept of "perfection" from the Latin: the [[French language|French]] "''[[w:fr:parfait|parfait]]''" and "''perfection''"; the [[Italian language|Italian]] "''[[w:it:perfetto|perfetto]]''" and "''[[w:it:perfezione|perfezione]]''"; the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] "''[[w:es:perfecto|perfecto]]''" and "''[[w:es:perfección|perfección]]''"; the [[English language|English]] "perfect" and "perfection"; the [[Russian language|Russian]] "''[[w:ru:совершенный|совершенный]]''" (sovyershenniy) and "''совершенcтво''" (sovyershenstvo); the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] "''savršen''" and "''savršenstvo''"; the [[Czech language|Czech]] "''dokonalost''"; the [[Slovak language|Slovak]] "''dokonaly''" and "''dokonalost''"; the [[Polish language|Polish]] "''doskonały''" and "''doskonałość''."&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p5 /&gt;

The genealogy of the concept of "perfection" reaches back beyond Latin, to [[Greek language|Greek]]. The Greek equivalent of the Latin "''perfectus''" was "''teleos''." The latter Greek expression generally had concrete referents, such as a perfect physician or flutist, a perfect comedy or a perfect social system. Hence the Greek "''teleiotes''" was not yet so fraught with abstract and superlative associations as would be the Latin "''perfectio''" or the modern "perfection." To avoid the latter associations, the Greek term has generally been translated as "[[wikt:complete|complete]]ness" rather than "perfection."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection:  the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest definition of "perfection", fairly precise and distinguishing the shades of the concept, goes back to [[Aristotle]]. In Book ''Delta'' of the ''Metaphysics'', he distinguishes three meanings of the term, or rather three shades of one meaning, but in any case three different concepts. That is perfect:
:1. which is complete — which contains all the requisite parts;
:2. which is so good that nothing of the kind could be better;
:3. which has attained its purpose.&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p7&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection:  the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these concepts is fairly well subsumed within the second. Between those two and the third, however, there arises a duality in concept. This duality was expressed by [[Thomas Aquinas]], in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', when he distinguished a twofold perfection: when a thing is perfect in itself — as he put it, in its ''substance''; and when it perfectly serves its ''purpose''.&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p7 /&gt;

The variants on the concept of perfection would have been quite of a piece for two thousand years, had they not been confused with other, kindred concepts. The chief of these was the concept of that which is the best:  in Latin, "''excellentia''" ("excellence"). In [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], "''excellentia''" and "''perfectio''" made a pair; thus, for example, dignitaries were called "''perfectissime''", just as they are now called "excellency."  Nevertheless, these two expression of high regard differ fundamentally: "''excellentia''" is a distinction among many, and implies comparison; while "''perfectio''" involves no comparison, and if something is deemed perfect, then it is deemed so in itself, without comparison to other things.  [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who thought much about perfection and held the world to be the [[Optimism#Philosophy|best of possible worlds]], did not claim that it was perfect.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection:  the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradoxes==
[[File:6655 - Roma - Ettore Ferrari, Giulio Cesare Vanini (1889) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 6-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|90px|[[Lucilio Vanini|Vanini]]]]
The parallel existence of two concepts of perfection, one strict ("perfection," as such) and the other loose ("excellence"), has given rise, perhaps since [[ancient history|antiquity]] but certainly since the [[Renaissance]], to a singular [[paradox]]: that the greatest perfection is imperfection. This was formulated by [[Lucilio Vanini]] (1585–1619), who had a precursor in the 16th-century writer [[Joseph Juste Scaliger]], and they in turn referred to the ancient philosopher [[Empedocles]]. Their argument, as given by the first two, was that if the world were perfect, it could not improve and so would lack "true perfection," which depends on progress. To [[Aristotle]], "perfect" meant "complete" ("nothing to add or subtract"). To Empedocles, according to Vanini, perfection depends on incompleteness ("''perfectio propter imperfectionem''"), since the latter possesses a potential for development and for complementing with new characteristics ("''perfectio complementii''"). This view relates to the [[baroque]] [[esthetic]] of Vanini and [[Marin Mersenne]]:  the perfection of an art work consists in its forcing the recipient to be active—to complement the art work by an effort of mind and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Paradoxes of Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 1 (winter 1980), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[paradox]] of perfection—that imperfection is perfect—applies not only to human affairs, but to [[technology]].  Thus, irregularity in [[semiconductor]] [[crystal]]s (an imperfection, in the form of [[contaminant]]s) is requisite for the production of semiconductors. The solution to the apparent paradox lies in a distinction between two concepts of "perfection": that of regularity, and that of [[utility]]. Imperfection is perfect in technology, in the sense that irregularity is useful.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Paradoxes of Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 1 (winter 1980), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perfect numbers==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Perfect number]] --&gt;
[[Perfect number]]s have been distinguished ever since the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] called them "''teleioi''." There was, however, no consensus among the Greeks as to which numbers were "perfect" or why. A view that was shared by [[Plato]] held that 10 was a perfect number.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Perfection in the Sciences.  I. Perfect Numbers," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mathematics|Mathematicians]], including the mathematician-philosopher [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], proposed as a perfect number, the number 6.&lt;ref name="TatarkiewiczSp1980p137"/&gt;

The number 10 was thought perfect because there are 10 fingers to the two hands. The number 6 was believed perfect for being divisible in a special way:  a sixth part of that number constitutes unity; a third is two; a half — three; two-thirds ({{lang-el|dimoiron}}) is four; five-sixths (''pentamoiron'') is five; six is the perfect whole.  The ancients also considered 6 a perfect number because the human foot constituted one-sixth the height of a man, hence the number 6 determined the height of the human body.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

[[File:EuclidStatueOxford.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Euclid]]]]
Thus both numbers, 6 and 10, were credited with perfection, both on purely mathematical grounds and on grounds of their relevance in nature.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt; Belief in the "perfection" of certain numbers survived [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], but this quality came to be ascribed to other numbers as well. The perfection of the number 3 actually became [[proverb]]ial: "''omne trinum perfectum''" ({{lang-la|all threes are perfect}}).  Another number, 7, found a devotee in the 6th-century [[Pope]] [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory I]] (Gregory the Great), who favored it on grounds similar to those of the Greek mathematicians who had seen 6 as a perfect number, and in addition for some reason he associated the number 7 with the concept of "[[eternity]]."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

The [[Middle Ages]], however, championed the perfection of 6: [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Alcuin]] wrote that [[God]] had created the world in 6 days because that was the perfect number.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

The Greek mathematicians had regarded as perfect that number which equals the [[summation|sum]] of its [[divisor]]s that are smaller than itself. Such a number is neither 3 nor 7 nor 10, but 6, for 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

But there are more numbers that show this property, such as 28, which = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. It became customary to call such numbers "perfect." [[Euclid]] gave a formula for (even) "perfect" numbers:
:N&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; (2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)
where ''p'' and 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 are [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

[[Euclid]] had listed the first four perfect numbers: 6; 28; 496; and 8128. A manuscript of 1456 gave the fifth perfect number: 33,550,336. Gradually mathematicians found further perfect numbers (which are very rare). In 1652 the [[Poland|Polish]] [[polymath]] [[Jan Brożek]] noted that there was no perfect number between 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection in the Sciences.  I. Perfect Numbers," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite over 2,000 years of study, it still is not known whether there exist infinitely many perfect numbers; or whether there are any odd ones.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

Today the term "perfect number" is merely historic in nature, used for the sake of tradition. These peculiar numbers had received the name on account of their analogy to the construction of man, who was held to be [[nature]]'s most perfect creation, and above all on account of their own peculiar regularity. Thus, they had been so named on the same grounds as perfect objects in nature, and perfectly proportioned edifices and statues created by man; the numbers had come to be called "perfect" in order to emphasize their special regularity.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

The [[Greece|Greek]] [[mathematician]]s had named these numbers "perfect" in the same sense in which [[philosopher]]s and [[artist]]s used the word. Jamblich (''In Nicomachi arithmeticam'', Leipzig, 1894) states that the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] had called the number 6 "marriage," "health," and "beauty," on account of the [[harmony]] and accord of that number.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

The perfect numbers early on came to be treated as the measure of other numbers: those in which the sum of the divisors is greater than the number itself, as in 12, have — since as early as [[Theon of Smyrna]], ca. 130 A.D. — been called "redundant" ({{lang-la|redundantio}}), "more than perfect" (''plus quam perfecti''), or "[[abundant number]]s", and those the sum of whose divisors is smaller, as in 8, have been called "[[deficient number]]s" (''deficientes'').&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

Currently 47 perfect numbers have been identified.

==Physics and chemistry==
[[File:Robert Boyle.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Robert Boyle|Boyle]]]]
A variety of [[physics|physical]] and [[chemistry|chemical]] [[concept]]s include, in their names, the word "perfect."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

The physicist designates as a ''[[rigid body|perfectly rigid]]'' body, one that "is not deformed by forces applied to it."  He uses the concept in the full awareness that this is a fictitious body, that no such body exists in [[nature]]. The concept is an ''[[thought experiment|ideal]] [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]]''.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Perfection in the Sciences.  II. Perfection in Physics and Chemistry," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[plasticity (physics)|perfectly plastic]]'' body is one that is deformed infinitely at a constant load corresponding to the body's limit of plasticity: this is a physical ''[[Physical model|model]]'', not a body observed in nature.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A ''[[black body|perfectly black]]'' body would be one that absorbed completely, radiation falling upon it — that is, a body with a coefficient of absorption equal to unity.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A [[crystal]] is perfect when its physically equivalent walls are equally developed; it has a perfect [[structure]] when it answers the requirements of spatial [[symmetry]] and is free of structural defects, dislocation, lacunae and other flaws.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A ''[[perfect fluid]]'' is one that is incompressible and non-viscous — this, again, is an [[ideal fluid]] that does not exist in nature.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A ''[[perfect gas]]'' is one whose molecules do not interact with each other and which have no volume of their own.  Such a gas is ''fictitious'', just as are perfectly solid, perfectly rigid, perfectly plastic and perfectly black bodies. They are termed "perfect" in the ''strict'' (non-metaphorical) sense of the word. These are all concepts that are necessary in physics, insofar as they are limiting, ideal, fictitious — insofar as they set the extreme which nature may at the most approach.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

In a ''looser'' sense, real things are called "perfect" if they approximate perfection more or less closely, though they be not, strictly speaking, perfect.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

The relation of these ''perfect'' bodies to ''real'' bodies may be illustrated by the relation of a perfect gas to a real one. The equation of state of a perfect gas is a first approximation to a quantum equation of state that results from statistical physics. Thus, the equation of state of a real gas within classical limits assumes the form of the equation of  state of a perfect gas. That is, the equation of state of a perfect gas describes an ideal gas (comprising points, that is, dimensionless molecules that do not act upon one another).&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

The [[ideal gas law|perfect gas equation]] arose from the work of [[Robert Boyle]], [[Edme Mariotte]] and [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]], who, in studying the properties of [[real gas]]es, found [[formula]]s applicable not to these but to an ideal, [[perfect gas]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

==Ethics==
[[File:Head Platon Glyptothek Munich 548.jpg|thumb|90px|[[Plato]]]]
The ''[[ethics|ethical]]'' question of perfection concerns not whether man ''is'' perfect, but whether he ''should'' be. And if he ''should'' be, then how is this to be attained?&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] seldom actually used the term, "perfection"; but the concept of "[[Good and evil|good]]", central to his philosophy, was tantamount to "perfection." He believed that approximation to the idea of perfection makes people perfect.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117 /&gt;

Soon after, the [[Stoics]] introduced the concept of perfection into ethics expressly, describing it as [[harmony]] — with [[nature]], [[reason]], man himself. They held that such harmony—such perfection—was attainable for anyone.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117 /&gt;

Plato and the Stoics had made perfection a [[philosophy|philosophical]] watchword. Soon it would be transformed, in [[Christianity]], into a [[religion|religious]] one.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117 /&gt;

The Christian doctrine of perfection is in the [[Gospels]] as well as elsewhere in the [[Bible]]. [[The Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:48 enjoins: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." &lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), pp. 117–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Christian writings, especially [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]'s, are replete with calls to perfection. Many of these are collected in a discourse by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], ''De perfectione iustitiae hominis''. They begin already with the [[Old Testament]]: "Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God." (''[[Deuteronomy]]'' 18:13.)  Elsewhere synonyms for "perfection" are "undefiled", "without rebuke", "without blemish", "blameless", "holy", "righteous", "unblamable", "unreprovable."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p118&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Augustine of Hippo.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]]]
Augustine explains that not only that man is properly termed perfect and without blemish who is already perfect, but also he who ''strives'' unreservedly after perfection. This is a broader concept, of ''approximate'' perfection, resembling that used in the [[exact sciences]]. The first ancient and Christian perfection was not very remote from modern ''self-perfection''. [[St. Ambrose]] in fact wrote about ''degrees'' of perfection ("''gradus piae perfectionis''").&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p118 /&gt;

Along with the idea of perfection, [[Holy Scripture]] conveyed doubt as to whether perfection was ''attainable'' for man. According to [[First Epistle of John|1 John]] 1:8, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." Similarly Jesus said in Matthew 19:17: "And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God..."; while Jesus does not deny that he himself is good, he does call into question the idea that anyone but God can even be good, let alone perfect. And [[St. Jerome]] wrote:  "''Perfectio vera in coelestibus''" — true perfection is to be found only in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), pp. 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 5th century CE, two distinct views on perfection had arisen within the Church: that it was attainable by man on earth by his own powers; and, that it may come to pass only by special [[divine grace]]. The first view, which was championed by [[Pelagius]], was condemned in 417 CE; the second view, which was championed by St. Augustine, prevailed at the very beginning of the 5th century and became authoritative.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the Church did not condemn the writings of the [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Areopagite]], purportedly the first [[bishop]] of [[Athens]], voicing a ''natural'' possibility for man to rise to perfection, to the contemplation of God. And so, for centuries, two views contended within the Church.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119 /&gt;

Even as, for the ancient philosophers, the essence of perfection had been [[harmony]], so for the [[Gospel]] and the Christian theologians it was [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], or love. [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] wrote (''[[Epistle to the Colossians]]'', 3:14): "And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119 /&gt;

[[St. Gregory]] wrote that perfection will be realized only after the fulfillment of history — only "then will the world be beautiful and perfect." Still, everyone should make his own approach to perfection — to [[Sacred|holiness]].  Discourses in moral theology and [[asceticism]] were generous with advice on how this was to be done.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119 /&gt;

The [[medieval]] concept of perfection and self-perfection, especially in its mature form, can be natural for modern man. As formulated by [[Peter Lombard]], this concept implies that perfection is a result of ''[[Personal development|development]]''. And as described by [[Giles of Rome]], perfection has not only personal sources ("''personalia''") but ''social'' ones ("''secundum statum''"). Since the individual is formed within a [[society]], the second perfection subsumes the first, in accordance with the "order of the universe" ("''ordo universi''"). The social perfection is ''binding'' on man, whereas personal perfection is only ''becoming'' to him.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p120&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Theses on perfection persist within the Church to the present day. The first condition for perfection is the desire of it. Also necessary is [[Divine grace|grace]] — but God gives grace to those who desire perfection and strive for it.  Another condition for perfection is constancy of striving and effort. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] says: "He who stops, regresses." And effort is necessary in things not only great but also in the smallest; the [[Gospel]] according to [[St. Luke]] says: "He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much:  and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much." An aid in approaching perfection is an awareness of [[God]]'s perfection and of one's own imperfection.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p120/&gt;

[[File:John Calvin Titian B.jpg|thumb|100px|[[John Calvin|Calvin]]]]
The 14th century saw, with the [[Scotism|Scotists]], a shift in interest from [[moral]] to [[ontology|ontological]] perfection; the 15th century, particularly during the [[Italian Renaissance]], a shift to [[art]]istic perfection.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The first half of the 16th century saw [[John Calvin]]'s complete conditioning of man's perfection on the [[divine grace|grace of God]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121 /&gt;

The second half of the 16th century brought the [[Counter-reformation]], the [[Council of Trent]], and a return of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] concept; and also, heroic attempts to attain perfection through [[contemplation]] and [[mortification of the flesh|mortification]]. This was the age of [[Ignatius Loyola]] and the founding of the [[Jesuit Order]]; of [[Teresa of Ávila|St. Teresa of Ávila]] (1515–82) and [[St. John of the Cross]] (1542–91), and the 1593 founding of the [[Discalced Carmelites|Barefoot Carmelites]]. This was the culminating point in the history of the [[Christianity|Christian]] idea of perfection; at the same time, it was the terminal point as there soon began attempts at reforming the idea.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121/&gt;

The first half of the 17th century saw attempts at a Catholic reform of the idea of perfection. This was the time of [[Cornelis Jansen]] (1585–1638) and of [[Jansenism]] — of a growing belief in [[predestination]] and in the impossibility of perfection without [[Divine grace|grace]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121 /&gt;

With the second half of the 17th century came a further development in the doctrine of [[predestination]] — the doctrine of "[[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietism]]." Perfection could be reached through a passive awaiting of grace rather than by an active striving. This theory, formulated in [[Spain]] by [[Miguel de Molinos]] (ca. 1628 - 1697), spread in [[France]], where it was espoused by [[Madame Guyon]] (1648–1717) and for a time attracted [[François Fénelon]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121 /&gt;

The 18th century brought a sea change to the idea of moral perfection. Faith in it remained, but it changed character from [[religion|religious]] to [[secular]]. This secular, 18th-century perfection was a fundamental article of faith for the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Its central tenet was that ''[[nature]] was perfect''; and perfect, too, was the man who lived in harmony with nature's law.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Primitive man was held to be the most perfect, for he was closest to nature. Perfection lay behind present-day man rather than before him, for [[civilization]] distanced man from perfection instead of bringing him closer to it.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

A second interpretation, however, took the contrary view: [[civilization]] perfected man by bringing him closer to [[reason]], and thereby to [[nature]]; for reason would direct life with due consideration for the [[natural law|laws of nature]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

The former, retrospective view of perfection had antecedents in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]: [[Hesiod]] and [[Ovid]] had described a "[[golden age]]" that had existed at the beginning of time, and which had been succeeded by silver, copper and Iron Ages, each inferior to the previous. The renewal of this view now, after two millennia, was stimulated by European contact with the "primitive" peoples of the [[Americas]]. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was but one of many who wrote in a similar vein.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

These two mid-18th-century schools of thought — one seeing perfection in [[nature]] and in the past, and the other in [[civilization]] and in the future — represented a reaction not against the idea of perfection, but against its [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] interpretation: as, earlier, the measure of perfection had been the idea of [[God]], so now it was the idea of [[nature]] or of [[civilization]]. It was the latter idea that ultimately gained the upper hand and passed into the 19th century as the legacy of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122/&gt;

The idea of perfection as transcendental, fell away; only worldly perfection counted. The idea that perfection was a matter of grace, also fell by the wayside; man himself must strive for it, and if a single man could not accomplish it, then perhaps mankind could. As [[God]] had been the measure of perfection during the [[Middle Ages]], so now man was: the measure had become smaller, more accessible. To the thinking of the 19th century, such worldly, human perfection might ultimately be attainable by everyone. And if not perfection, then ''improvement''.  This would be the great concept of the [[modern age]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

At the very midpoint of the 18th century, there occurred an exceptional momentary retreat from the idea of perfection.  It was in the [[France|French]] ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The entry, "Perfection" (vol. XII, 1765), discussed only technical perfection, in the sense of the matching of human products to the tasks set for them; no mention was made of [[ontology|ontological]], [[morality|moral]] or [[esthetics|esthetic]] perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise, the 18th century saw great declarations championing the future perfection of man, as in [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''Idee zu einer allgemeinem Geschichte'' (1784) and [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]]'s ''Ideen'' (1784/91).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

Perfection was expected to come about by a variety of means. Partly it would be by way of ''natural'' development and progress (the view espoused by [[David Hume]]) but more so by way of ''[[education]]'' (precursors of this view included [[John Locke]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], and the leaders of the [[Polish Enlightenment]]) and by way of overt ''state'' action ([[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], later [[Jeremy Bentham]]); reliance was placed in [[cooperation]] among people ([[Charles Fourier]], 1808), later in [[eugenics]] ([[Francis Galton]], 1869). While the foundations of the faith in the future perfectibility of man changed, the faith itself persisted. It linked the people of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] with the [[idealism|idealists]] and [[romanticism|romantics]] — with [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], the [[Polish messianism|Polish Messianists]] — as well as with the 19th-century [[Positivism|Positivists]] and [[evolutionism|evolutionists]]; [[Herbert Spencer]] penned a great new declaration championing the future perfection of man.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

The idea of human perfectibility had, however, become more comprehensive. Man would attain greater perfection, in the sense that he would live more rationally, healthily, happily, comfortably. But there was no adequate term for this new conception, as the term "perfection" had a moral coloring, while the new goal was more intellectual, physical and social.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

In 1852, [[John Henry Newman]], the future [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], wrote that it would be well if the [[English language]], like the [[Greek language|Greek]], had a term to express [[intellect]]ual perfection, analogously to the term "[[health]]", which addresses man's physical state, and to "[[virtue]]", which speaks to his moral nature. During the 19th century, the [[Germany|Germans]] would come to call perfection, thus construed, "culture" (''Kultur''), and the [[France|French]] would call it "civilization" (''civilisation'').&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

One of the elements of perfection, in its new construction, is ''[[health]]'', understood by the [[World Health Organization]] as "a state of complete physical and mental well-being."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 124"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the burgeoning achievements of contemporary [[biology]] have not dislodged the age-old interest in moral perfection — with the important distinction, that the goal now is not so much perfection as ''improvement''. A classic early-19th century exponent of this view was [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 124"/&gt;

In the 20th and 21st centuries, the advances of [[science]] and [[technology]] appear to have been paralleled to some extent by increasingly pluralistic attitudes. The [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]] [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] (1886–1980) has written: "To demand of someone that he strive after perfection seems equally inappropriate as to blame him for not striving after it." Such striving, he adds, "is often egocentric and yields poorer moral and social results than an outward-directed behavior based not on self-perfection but on good will and kindliness toward others."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 124"/&gt;

==Aesthetics==
The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] viewed perfection as a requisite for [[beauty]] and high [[art]]. The [[Pythagoreans]] held that perfection was to be found in the right [[Body proportions|proportions]] and in a [[harmony|harmonious]] arrangement of parts. The idea that beauty and art were characterized by perfection, was subsequently embraced by [[Plato]], who believed that art ought to be "apt, suitable, without deviations" — in short, "perfect".&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewiczn p. 145"&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a conviction that perfection was a single quality, the Pythagoreans, Plato and their adherents held that beauty also was a single quality; hence, for every kind of art, there was but one perfect and proper [[Substantial form|form]]. [[Plutarch]] stated (''De Musica'') that, during the early Greek age, musical [[harmony|harmonies]] that were recognized as perfect were ''legally binding'' at public performances.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewiczn p. 145" /&gt;

Similarly, in [[temple]] [[architecture]] from the 5th century BCE, there were established [[classical order|orders]].  There were established [[Proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s for [[Doric order|Doric]] temples, and for [[Ionia|Ionic]] temples. Likewise in [[sculpture]], for centuries, it was a matter of dogma that certain proportions of the human body were perfect and obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 145–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a prevalent belief that certain [[shape]]s and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportions]] were in themselves perfect. Plato felt that the perfect proportion was the [[ratio]] of the [[Edge (geometry)|side]] to the [[diagonal]] of a [[square (geometry)|square]]. His authority was so great that architects and other artists continued using this proportion, even when ignorant of its source, as late as the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|left|125px|[[Cicero]]]]
Another early idea — one that was to be espoused by many illustrious writers and artists of various periods — found perfection in the [[circle]] and the [[sphere]]. [[Aristotle]] wrote in the ''Physica'' that the circle was "the perfect, first, most beautiful form." [[Cicero]] wrote in ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' (On the Nature of the Gods): "Two [[shape|forms]] are the most distinctive:  of [[solid]]s, the [[sphere]]... and of [[plane figure]]s, the [[circle]]...  There is nothing more [[symmetry|commensurate]] than these forms."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"/&gt;

In a commentary to Aristotle's ''De coelo et mundo'' (''[[On the Heavens|On the Heavens and Earth]]''), the [[medieval]] [[Poles|Pole]], [[Jan of Słupcza]], wrote: "The most perfect body ought to have the most perfect form, and such [a body] is [[heaven]], while the most perfect form is the round form, for nothing can be added to it." In the famous illustrated ''Les très riches heures du duc de Berry'', [[paradise]] is depicted as contained within an ideal [[sphere]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"/&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] [[architect]] [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554) stated: "the round form is the most perfect of all."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"/&gt;

The most excellent of 16th-century architects, [[Andrea Palladio]], held that "the most perfect and most excellent" form was "the round form, since of all forms it is the simplest, the most uniform, the strongest, the most capacious" and "is the most suitable for rendering the unity, infinity, uniformity and righteousness of God." This was the same thought as in Jan of Słupcza and in Serlio, and it was one of uncommon durability.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle Ages]] — [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[High Medieval|Gothic]] alike — had been quite taken with the idea of perfection. But a true explosion of the imperative for perfection came with the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

Renaissance aesthetics placed less emphasis than had [[classicism|classical]] aesthetics on the unity of things perfect. [[Baldassare Castiglione]], in his ''[[Il Cortegiano|Courtier]]'', wrote, of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Giorgione]], that "each of them is unlike the others, but each is the most perfect [''perfectissimus''] in his style." &lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

[[File:Daniele Barbaro by Titian.jpg|thumb|[[Daniele Barbaro|Barbaro]]]]
The great [[architect]] and [[polymath]] [[Leone Battista Alberti]] wrote (''De architectura'') that "the art of building... in [[Italy]] [had] achieved perfect maturity", that the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] had "created such a perfect art of building that there was in it nothing mysterious, hidden or unclear." This was yet another formulation of the concept of perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

[[Daniele Barbaro]], in his 1567 translation of [[Vitruvius]], classically defined perfection as "that which lacks nothing and to which nothing can be added."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

The Renaissance showed a marked concern with ''preeminence'' in perfection. Leonardo concluded that the most perfect of the [[arts]] was [[painting]]. In 1546 [[Benedetto Varchi]] compared great masters in the arts. Others compared [[art]] and [[science]], [[art]] and [[nature]], and perfection in the arts of the ancients with that in the modern masters. The 16th century saw comparisons of their music, the 17th — of their [[visual arts]] and especially of their [[poetry]]. These comparisons construed perfection fairly loosely; the concept was treated more strictly by [[architecture|architects]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] distinguished a variety of properties to perfection. It was variously held to be:
* an ''objective'' property ([[Petrarch]], who opposed perfection to other esthetic qualities such as grace);
* specific to ''[[art]]'' rather than to nature ([[Vasari]]);
* a ''rare'' property ([[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]] felt that not even Greek architecture had attained perfection);
* a property of the ''whole'' work rather than of its parts ([[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]]);
* a conjunction of ''many'' values ([[Lodovico Dolce]] thought [[Raphael]] perfect because Raphael had manifold talent, as opposed to the one-sided [[Michelangelo]]);
* something that required not merely talent but art, that is, ''[[skill]]'' ([[Vasari]]);
* not the ''sole'' value in a work of [[art]] ([[Vasari]] differentiated perfection from grace; Renaissance [[Platonism|Platonists]] such as [[Ficino]] viewed perfection as a divine attribute).&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[eclecticism|eclectic]] view of the late Renaissance, perfection in a work would require uniting the talents of ''many'' artists. [[Paolo Pino]] held that only that painter would be perfect who combined the talents of [[Titian]] and [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of perfection was harder to apply to Renaissance [[literature]] but became so common — often, linked to "''eccelente''" — as to become banal. Its frequent application brought about its [[relativization]] and even [[subjectivity|subjectivization]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"/&gt;

Beginning with [[Sebastiano Serlio|Serlio]] and [[Palladio]], perfection in art had become less important, less definite, less objective. The striving for perfection no longer had the importance for [[man of letters|men of letters]] that it did for the great [[architect]]s. But the 17th century still revered perfection, as shown by the appearance of that word in book titles: ''De perfecta poesi'' by the [[Poland|Polish]] [[poet]] [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] (1595–1640); ''Le peintre parfait'' (1767 by [[André Félibien]]; and ''Idée de la perfection de la peinture'' (1662) by [[Fréart de Chambray]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"/&gt;

Sarbiewski offered several theses: poetry not only imitates things ''perfectissime'' ("most perfectly"), but imitates them as they ought ''perfectissime'' to be in nature; perfect art is recognized by its agreement with nature, as well as its universality; art is the more perfect, the nobler (''nobilior'') its manner of representing things; it is the more perfect, the more truths it contains; perfection has various degrees — it is higher in [[poetry]] than in [[prose]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"/&gt;

In [[classicism]], especially in [[France|French]] 17th-century classicism, from an ''ideal'' attainable by few, perfection became an ''obligation'' for every author. And inasmuch as the criterion of perfection had been lowered, "perfection" now meant only ''correctness.'' In the ensuing devaluation, it was not enough that art be ''perfecta'', it should be ''perfectissima''.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perfection, formerly the ''supreme'' characterization for a work of art, now became but one of ''many'' positive characterizations. [[Cesare Ripa]], in his ''Iconologia'' (published 1593, but typical for the 17th century), presented ''perfezione'' as a concept of equal status with grace (''grazia''), prettiness (''venustà'') and [[beauty]] (''bellezza'').&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s pupil, [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], in his ''Psychology'', wrote that beauty consists in perfection, and that this was why beauty was a source of pleasure.  No such general esthetic theory, explicitly naming perfection, had ever been formulated by any of its devotees from [[Plato]] to [[Palladio]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"/&gt;

[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Edmund Burke|Burke]]]]
Wolff's theory of beauty-as-perfection was developed by the school's chief aesthetician, [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]]. This tradition remained active in Germany as late as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], who considered both [[beauty]] and [[sublimity]] to be ideas of perfection; when unity prevailed, beauty emerged; when plurality — sublimity.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"/&gt;

In the latter part of the 18th century, [[Immanuel Kant]] wrote much in his ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' about perfection — inner and outer, objective and subjective, qualitative and quantitative, perceived clearly and obscurely, the perfection of nature and that of art. Nevertheless, in aesthetics Kant found that "The judgment of taste [i.e., aesthetic judgment] is entirely independent of the concept of perfection" — that is, beauty was something different from perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"/&gt;

Earlier in the 18th century, [[France]]'s leading aesthetician, [[Denis Diderot]], had questioned whether perfection was a more comprehensible idea than beauty. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] had treated perfection as an unreal concept, and wrote [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], "Let us not seek the [[wiktionary:chimera|chimera]] of perfection, but that which is the best possible."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], in 1757, the important aesthetician [[Edmund Burke]] denied that perfection was the cause of beauty.  Quite the contrary, he argued that beauty nearly always involved an element of ''imperfection''; for example, women, in order to heighten their attractiveness, emphasized their weakness and frailty, which is to say, their imperfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"/&gt;

The 18th century was the last for which perfection was a principal concept in aesthetics. In the 19th century, perfection survived only vestigially as a general expression of approval. [[Alfred de Musset]] held that "Perfection is no more attainable for us than is infinity. One ought not to seek it anywhere: not in love, nor beauty, nor happiness, nor virtue; but one should love it, in order to be virtuous, beautiful and happy, insofar as that is possible for man."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"/&gt;

In the 20th century, [[Paul Valéry]] wrote: "To strive for perfection, to devote endless time to a work, to set oneself—like [[Goethe]]—an unattainable goal, are all intents that are precluded by the pattern of modern life."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"/&gt;

The dismissal of the question concerning whether artists ''can'' achieve perfection, still left the question: Do artists ''want'' to achieve it? Is that their actual goal? Some artists, schools and epochs ''have'' aimed for perfection. Others have nurtured ''other'' goals: pluralism, novelty, powerful sensations, faithfulness to truth, self-expression and expression of the world, [[creativity]] and [[originality]] — all of which may roughly be summarized as "expression."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 151–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been ages of perfection, and ages of expression. The arts of [[ancient Greece]], the [[Renaissance]] and [[neoclassicism]] were arts of perfection. In the [[mannerism|mannerist]], [[baroque]] and [[romanticism|romantic]] periods, expression has prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ontology and theology==
The Greek philosopher [[Anaximander]] described the world as "endless" (''apeiron''), [[Xenophanes]] — as "the greatest" (''megistos'').  But while they ascribed great qualities to the world, they did not regard it as perfect.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 187"&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parmenides.jpg|thumb|left|80px|[[Parmenides]]]]
Only [[Parmenides]] seems to have considered [[existence]] to be "''tetelesmenon''" ("finished"); and [[Melissus of Samos|Melissos]], his successor in the [[Eleatics|Eleatic school]], said that existence "was entirely" ("''pan esti''"). Thus both saw perfection in existence; true existence was one, constant, immutable.  Moreover, Parmenides thought the world to be [[wiktionary:finite|finite]], limited in all directions, and like a [[sphere]] — which was a mark of its perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 187" /&gt;

Parmenides' view was embraced to some extent by [[Plato]]. He thought that the world was the work of a good [[Demiurge]], and that this was why order and harmony prevailed in the world.  The world was the best, the most beautiful, perfect. It had a perfect shape (spherical) and a perfect motion (circular).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 187"/&gt;

But Plato said nothing about the Demiurge architect-of-the-world himself being perfect. And understandably so, for perfection implied finitude, limits; whereas it was the world, not its creator, that had limits. A similar view was held by [[Aristotle]]: the world could be perfect, but God could not.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 187–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the [[pantheism|pantheist]] [[Stoics]] held the divinity to be perfect — precisely because they identified it with the world. [[Cicero]] wrote in ''De natura deorum'' (On the Nature of the Gods) that the world "encompasses... within itself all beings... And what could be more nonsensical than denying perfection to an all-embracing being...  Besides the world, there is no thing that does not lack something and that is harmonious, perfect and finished in every respect..."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 188"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a certain moment, Greek philosophy became bound up with the religion of the [[Christianity|Christians]]: the abstract concept of [[first cause]] became linked with the religious concept of [[God]]; the ''[[primum movens]]'' became identified with the [[Creator deity|Creator]], the absolute with the divine Person. Features of an absolute existence were discovered in the Person of the Creator: He was immutable, timeless. And absolute existence took on the attributes of a person: it was good, omnipotent, omnipresent. Christian [[theology]] united the features of the [[first cause]] in Aristotle's ''[[Metaphysics]]'' with those of the Creator in the ''[[Book of Genesis]]''. But the attributes of God did not include perfection, for a perfect being must be ''finite''; only of such a being might one say that it lacked nothing.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 188"/&gt;

There was another reason for the denial, to God, of perfection — in a branch of Christian theology that was under the influence of [[Plotinus]]. In this view, the absolute from which the world derived could not be grasped in terms of human [[concept]]s, even the most general and transcendent. Not only was that absolute not [[matter]], it was not [[spirit]] either, nor [[idea]]; it was superior to these. It exceeded any description or praise; it was incomprehensible and ineffable; it was beyond all that we may imagine — including perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 188"/&gt;

[[Medieval]] Christian philosophy held that the concept of perfection might describe Creation, but was not appropriate to describe God. Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], indicating that he was following [[Aristotle]], defined a perfect thing as one that "possesses that of which, by its nature, it is capable." Also (''[[Summa Theologica]]''): "That is perfect, which lacks nothing of the perfection proper to it." Thus there were, in the world, things perfect and imperfect, more perfect and less perfect. God permitted imperfections in Creation when they were necessary for the good of the whole.  And for man it was natural to go by degrees from imperfection to perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Duns Scotus]] understood perfection still more simply and mundanely: "Perfection is that which it is better to have than not to have." It was not an attribute of God but a property of creation: all things partook of it to a greater or lesser degree. A thing's perfection depended on what sort of perfection it was eligible for. In general, that was perfect which had attained the fullness of the qualities possible for it.  Hence "whole" and "perfect" meant more or less the same ("''totum et perfectum sunt quasi idem''").&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|[[Benedict Spinoza|Spinoza]]]]
This was a [[teleology|teleological]] concept, for it implied an [[telos (philosophy)|end]] (goal or purpose). God created things that served certain purposes, created even those purposes, but He himself did not serve any purpose.  Since God was not finite, He could not be called perfect: for the concept of perfection served to describe ''finite'' things. Perfection was not a [[theology|theological]] concept, but an [[ontology|ontological]] one, because it was a feature, in some degree, of every [[being]]. The 9th-century thinker [[Paschasius Radbertus]] wrote: "Everything is the more perfect, the more it resembles God." Still, this did not imply that God himself was perfect.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of perfection, as an attribute of God, entered [[theology]] only in modern times, through [[René Descartes]] — and in the ''[[plural]]'', as the "perfections" of God.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 190–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Descartes, the concept of perfection as a principal concept in philosophy was upheld by other great 17th-century thinkers. In [[Benedict Spinoza]]'s philosophy, however, there was no personal God, and perfection became a property of — even a synonym for — the existence of reality (that is, for the essence of things).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 191"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] wrote: "As M. Descartes states, ''existence'' itself is perfection." Leibniz added: "Perfection, I call any simple quality, if it is positive and absolute, such that, if it expresses something, it does so without limits."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 191"/&gt;

At the same time, Leibniz also construed perfection, in his ''[[Monadology]]'', in an utterly different way: "Only that is perfect which possesses no limits, that is, only God."  This concept would last out the entire 17th century.  Subsequently, [[Immanuel Kant]] would describe perfection as "''omnitudo realitatis''" ("the omnitude of reality").  Thus perfection, which during the [[Middle Ages]] could be a property of any individual being, in 17th-century philosophy became as well, and indeed preeminently, a property of God.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 191"/&gt;

Leibniz's pupil and successor, [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], took up this concept of perfection — but with a difference. Wolff ascribed perfection not to being as a whole, but once again to its individual constituents. He gave, as examples, an eye that sees faultlessly, and a watch that runs faultlessly. He also distinguished variants — ''perfectio simplex'' and ''composita'', ''primaria'' and ''secundaria'' — and differentiated the magnitude of perfection (''magnitudo perfectionis'').&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 191–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolff's pupil, [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], derived perfection from rules, but anticipated their collisions (''regularum collisio'') leading to exceptions (''exceptio'') and limiting the perfection of things. Baumgarten distinguished perfection ''simplex'' and ''composita'', ''interna'' and ''externa'', ''transcendentalis'' and ''accidentalis''; and, positing so broad a construction, he arrived at the conclusion that "everything is perfect."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, Wolff and his pupils had returned to the [[ontology|ontological]] concept of perfection that the [[Scholastics]] had used. The ''[[theology|theological]]'' concept of perfection had lived only from Descartes to Leibniz, in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

Thanks to Wolff's school, the concept of perfection lasted in [[Germany]] through the 18th century. In other western countries, however, especially [[France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], in that century the concept of perfection was already in decline. It was ignored by the French ''[[Grande Encyclopédie]]''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

The history of the concept of perfection had undergone great evolutions — from "''Nothing'' in the world is perfect", to "''Everything'' is perfect"; and from "Perfection is ''not'' an attribute of God", to "Perfection ''is'' an attribute of God."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

With [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]'s school, every thing had become perfect. This was a singular moment in the history of the [[ontology|ontological]] concept of perfection; and soon thereafter, that history came to an end.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

==Many concepts==
The foregoing discussion shows that the ''term'' "perfection" has been used to designate a variety of ''[[concept]]s'':
* The word "perfection" has a special meaning in [[mathematics]], where it gives a ''[[proper name]]'' to certain [[number]]s that demonstrate uncommon properties.
* In [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], "perfection" designates a ''[[scientific model|model]]'' — a conceptual construct for bodies that in reality do not precisely correspond to the model.
* Elsewhere the term "perfection" is used consistently with the word's [[etymology]] ("perfect" = "finished"). That is perfect which ''lacks nothing''. This is how the term has been used in [[ontology]] (a perfect being), [[ethics]] (a perfect life) and [[medicine]] (perfect health). In these fields, the concept is understood variously as ''ideal [[model (abstract)|model]]'' or as ''actual [[approximation]]'' to the model.
* Also called "perfect" is that which completely ''achieves its purpose''. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] gave examples from [[biology]] (perfect vision) and [[technology]] (a clock that runs neither slow nor fast).  Here "perfection" is less fictitious [[model (abstract)|model]] than actual ''[[approximation]]'' to the model.
* That is "perfect," which completely fulfills its functions. In ''social'' discourse, one speaks of a perfect artist, engineer or carpenter. The term is used similarly in [[art]] criticism, when speaking of perfect technique or of the perfect likeness of a portrait. Here again, "perfection" is either ideal model or approximate realization of the model.
* In [[aesthetics]] and [[art theory]], perfection is ascribed to what is fully [[harmony|harmonious]] — to what is constructed in accordance with a single principle (e.g., the [[Parthenon]], the ''[[Odyssey]]'').&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz p. 11"&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "On Perfection:  Conclusion,"  ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 2 (spring 1981), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for the first, mathematical sense, all these concepts of "perfection" show a kinship and oscillate between [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]] and [[approximation]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz p. 11" /&gt;

However, the expression "perfect" is also used [[colloquial]]ly as a [[superlative]] ("perfect idiot," "perfect scoundrel," "perfect storm"). Here ''perfectum'' is confused with ''excellens'' of an approving, admiring or condemnatory kind.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "On Perfection:  Conclusion," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 2 (spring 1981), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perfection has also been construed as that which is ''the best''. In [[theology]], when [[Descartes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] termed [[God]] "perfect," they had in mind something other than ''[[model (abstract)|model]]''; than that which ''lacks nothing''; than that ''achieves its purpose''; than that fulfills its functions; or than that ''is [[harmony|harmonious]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "On Perfection:  Conclusion,"  ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 2 (spring 1981), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3639">[[File:Pierre Laromiguière.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Pierre Laromiguière]]
'''Pierre Laromiguière''' (3 November 1756 – 12 August 1837) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]].

==Life==
He was born at [[Livinhac-le-Haut]], [[Rouergue]], and died in [[Paris]].  As professor of philosophy at the [[University of Toulouse]], he was unsuccessful and incurred the displeasure of the French parliament by his thesis on the rights of property in connection with taxation. Subsequently he came to Paris, where he was appointed professor of logic in the [[École Normale]] and lectured in the [[Prytanée]]. In 1799 he was made a member of the Tribunate, and in 1833 of the [[Academy of Moral and Political Science]]. In 1793 he published ''Projet d'éléments de métaphysique'', a work characterized by lucidity and excellence of style. He wrote also two ''Mémoires'', read before the Institute, ''Les Paradoxes de Condillac'' (1805) and ''Le cours de philosophie'' (1815&amp;ndash;1818).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Laromiguière's philosophy is a revolt against the extreme physiological [[psychology]] of the natural scientists, such as [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis|Cabanis]]. He distinguished between those psychological phenomena which can be traced directly to purely physical causes, and the actions of the soul which originate from within itself. Psychology was not for him a branch of physiology, nor on the other hand did he give to his theory an abstruse metaphysical basis. A pupil of [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]] and indebted for much of his ideology to [[Antoine Destutt de Tracy]], he attached a fuller importance to "attention" as a psychic faculty. Attention provides the facts, Comparison groups and combines them, while Reason systematizes and explains. The soul is active in its choice, i.e. is endowed with freewill, and is, therefore, immortal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

For natural science as a method of discovery he had no respect. He held that its judgments are, at the best, statements of identity, and that its so-called discoveries are merely the reiteration, in a new form, of previous truisms. Laromiguière was not the first to develop these views; he owed much to Condillac, Destutt de Tracy and Cabanis. The accuracy of his language and the purity of his style gave his works great influence, especially over [[Armand Marrast]], [[Louis Cardaillac]] and [[Victor Cousin]]. A lecture of his in the École Normale impressed Cousin so strongly that he at once devoted himself to the study of philosophy. [[Théodore Simon Jouffroy|Jouffroy]] and [[Hippolyte Taine]] agree in describing him as one of the great thinkers of the 19th century.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He is a specialist in the history of Freemasonry, covering both social and political fields, as well as philosophical and spiritual topics. He has researched the links between Freemasonry and the power in France under Napoleon (1800–1815) and during the Third Republic (1870–1940). As an expert in the history of Masonic rites, he has also researched the various aspects of the symbolic imagery (guild marks, heraldry, emblems).
Editor-in-chief of the symbolic and Masonic review, ''Renaissance Traditionnelle'', of the on-line Journal [http://www.ipsonet.org/104-publications/128-ritual-secrecy-and-civil-society ''Ritual, Secrecy, and Civil Society''] he co-directs the ''Chroniques d’Histoire Maçonnique''. He also contributes to several other reviews, including ''Politica Hermetica'' and ''La Phalère''. Furthermore, he is an expert on and biographer of French painter [[Jean-François Garneray|François-Jean Garneray]] (1755–1837), one of [[Jacques-Louis David]]’s first students.
He was named officer in the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French Ministry of Culture.

'''Pieter Nicolaas/Nicolaus van Eyck''' ([[Breukelen]], 1 October 1887 - [[Wassenaar]], 28 April 1954)

He was born Pieter Nicolaas '''van Eijk''' and changed his name to '''van Eyck''' around 1907.
He worked as a foreign correspondent for the Dutch newspaper NRC in Rome and London, but also a [[poet]], [[critic]], [[essayist]] and [[philosopher]] from the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn1/eijk (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]])&lt;/ref&gt; Awarded the [[Constantijn Huygens Prize]] in 1947.

==Education==
Van Eyck attended [[Gymnasium Haganum]] before studying law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =De briefwisseling tussen P.N. van Eyck en Albert Verwey | publisher =dbnl | year =2007 | url =http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/eyck001hawa01_01/eyck001hawa01_01.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =3 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Albert Verwey]] resigned from the university of Leiden in 1935, van Eyck took on the professorship for Dutch language and literature there, a position which he held until his death.

==Family==
He married on 28 April 1914 Nelly Estelle Benjamins ([[Suriname]], 17 August 1891 - [[Wassenaar]], [[South Holland]], 1971), a woman of [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardic]] origin born and raised in [[Suriname]].&lt;ref&gt;Marlene A.

They were the parents of: 
* [[Robert Floris van Eyck]] or van Eijk, a [[London]] [[poet]], [[artist]] and [[art restorer]]
* [[Aldo van Eyck]] or van Eijk, [[architect]]

==Works==
[[File:DeTuinmanEnDeDood2017.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Quotation from ''Death and the Gardener'' (P.N. van Eyckhof, Leiden)]]
His most famous poem "Death and the Gardener" (1926)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_ert001192602_01/_ert001192602_01_0020.php Erts. Letterkundige Almanak, Year 1 (1926)]&lt;/ref&gt; is a theme taken from [[Jean Cocteau]]’s novel "Le grand écart". In his turn, Cocteau took the story from [[Rumi]]. Another version is in the Babylonian [[Talmud]]. The Van Eyck poem was translated in English by David Colmer in 2007. Colmer's translation received the David Reid Poetry Translation Prize and was printed by the Bucheliuspers in Utrecht.

The '''Pioneers of the Revolution''' ({{lang-fr|Pionniers de la Révolution}}) was a youth organisation in [[Burkina Faso]], modelled along the pattern of the [[pioneer movement]]s typically operated by [[Communism|communist]] parties, such as the contemporary [[Pioneers of Enver]], [[José Martí Pioneer Organization|José Martí Pioneer Organisation]] and [[Agostinho Neto Pioneer Organization|Agostinho Neto Pioneer Organisation]]. The Pioneers of the Revolution organised children of all ages. Much like many other young pioneer movements, such as the [[Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization|Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organisation]] and the [[Young Pioneers of China]], the most distinct sign of the Pioneers were their red scarves, joined by rudimentary uniforms and [[Beret#As a revolutionary symbol|yellow berets]].

The movement was founded by Captain [[Thomas Sankara]], a [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[Pan-Africanism|pan-Africanist]] revolutionary who came to power in what was then the [[Republic of Upper Volta]] after a popularly-supported coup in 1983. Sankara undertook what he called the "Democratic and Popular Revolution" ({{lang-fr|Révolution démocratique et populaire}}), a radical transformation of society. Many of the measures taken by Sankara and his Council of Popular Salvation junta were concerned with children – for example, [[female genital mutilation]] and [[forced marriage]]s were banned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sissoho|first=Oumie C.|date=2008|title=Analysis of the Role of the United Nations, International Organizations and NGOs in the Eradication of Female Genital Mutilation|location=[[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]|publisher=[[ProQuest]]|pages=31–32|isbn=978-054-965-974-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a nationwide literacy campaign was held, and approximately 2.5 million children were vaccinated against [[meningitis]], [[yellow fever]] and [[measles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kobo|first=Kingsley|date=31 October 2014|title=Burkina Faso: Ghost of 'Africa's Che Guevara'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/10/burkina-faso-thomas-sankara-africa-che-guevara-2014103017525682241.html|newspaper=[[Al Jazeera]]|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other entities created by Sankara's government included the [[Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (Burkina Faso)|Committees for the Defense of the Revolution]], which many Pioneers belonged to as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=West Africa|publisher=Afrimedia International|page=1223|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Popular Revolutionary Tribunal (Burkina Faso)|Popular Revolutionary Tribunals]]. Much like the Committees and the Tribunals, the Pioneers of the Revolution were abolished after Thomas Sankara was killed in 1987 by a military coup led by his former friend and colleague [[Blaise Compaoré]], who would remain in power until his own overthrow in the [[2014 Burkinabé uprising]]. One of the primary opposition groups against Compaoré's government was the [[Le Balai Citoyen|Citizens' Broom]] ({{lang-fr|Le Balai Citoyen}}). Its leader, the musician [[Sams’K Le Jah]], stated in a 2014 interview that he received his political education as a teenager in Sankara's pioneer youth movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duval Smith|first=Alex|date=30 April 2014|title='Africa's Che Guevara': Thomas Sankara's legacy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27219307|newspaper=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|location=[[Ouagadougou]]|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law legal systems]], '''precedent''' is a principle or rule established in a previous [[legal case]] that is either binding on or persuasive for a [[court]] or other [[tribunal]] when deciding subsequent cases with similar issues or [[fact]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Precedent | url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/precedent?s=t | publisher= Dictionary.com | accessdate=September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, p. 1059 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattinson|first=Shaun D|date=2015-03-01|title=The Human Rights Act and the doctrine of precedent|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lest.12049/abstract|journal=Legal Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=142–164|doi=10.1111/lest.12049|issn=1748-121X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|Common-law]] legal systems place great value on deciding cases according to consistent principled rules, so that similar facts will yield similar and predictable outcomes, and observance of precedent is the mechanism by which that goal is attained. The principle by which judges are bound to precedents is known as '''''stare decisis'''''.  [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|Common-law precedent]] is a third kind of law, on equal footing with [[statutory law]] (that is, statutes and codes enacted by legislative bodies) and [[delegated legislation]] (in U.K. parlance) or [[regulatory law]] (in U.S. parlance) (that is, regulations promulgated by executive branch agencies).

[[Case law]], in common-law jurisdictions, is the set of decisions of adjudicatory tribunals or other rulings that can be cited as precedent. In most countries, including most European countries, the term is applied to any set of rulings on law, which is guided by previous rulings, for example, previous decisions of a government agency.

Essential to the development of case law is the publication and indexing of decisions for use by lawyers, courts, and the general public, in the form of [[law reports]]. While all decisions are precedent (though at varying levels of authority as discussed throughout this article), some become [[Lists of landmark court decisions|"leading cases" or "landmark decisions"]] that are cited especially often.

In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, past decisions may [[precedent#Precedent_in_civil_law|influence]] future decisions, even if they do not have the precedential, binding effect that they have in common law decision-making.

{{TOC limit|4}}

==Principle==
''Stare decisis'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|eɪ|r|i|_|d|ᵻ|ˈ|s|aɪ|s|ᵻ|s|,_|ˈ|s|t|ɑː|r|eɪ}}) is a legal principle by which judges are obligated to respect the precedent established by prior decisions. The words originate from the phrasing of the principle in the [[Latin]] maxim ''Stare decisis et non quieta movere'': "to stand by decisions and not disturb the undisturbed".&lt;ref name=Adeleye&gt;Adeleye, Gabriel et al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=a4ddQNrt8e8C&amp;pg=PA371 World Dictionary of Foreign Expressions: a Resource for Readers and Writers]'', page 371 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; In a legal context, this means that courts should abide by precedent and not disturb settled matters.&lt;ref name=Adeleye /&gt;  The principle can be divided into two components:&lt;ref name=kmiec/&gt;

# A decision made by a superior court, or by the same court in an earlier decision, is binding precedent that the court itself and all its inferior courts must follow.&lt;ref name=kmiec/&gt;
# A court may overturn its own precedent, but should do so only if a strong reason exists to do so, and even in that case, should be guided by principles from superior, lateral, and inferior courts.&lt;ref name=kmiec/&gt;

The second principle, regarding [[persuasive precedent]], reflects the broad precedent guidance a court may draw upon in reaching all of its decisions.&lt;ref name=kmiec&gt;Kmiec, Keenan. The Origin and Current Meanings of "Judicial Activism", ''California Law Review'' (2004):

{{quote|Some instances of disregarding precedent are almost universally considered inappropriate. For example, in a rare showing of unity in a Supreme Court opinion discussing judicial activism, Justice Stevens wrote that a circuit court "engaged in an indefensible brand of judicial activism" when it "refused to follow" a "controlling precedent" of the Supreme Court. The rule that lower courts should abide by controlling precedent, sometimes called "'''''vertical precedent'''''," can safely be called settled law. It appears to be equally well accepted that the act of disregarding vertical precedent qualifies as one kind of judicial activism. "'''''Horizontal precedent'''''," the doctrine requiring a court "to follow its own prior decisions in similar cases," is a more complicated and debatable matter....[A]cademics argue that it is sometimes proper to disregard horizontal precedent. Professor Gary Lawson, for example, has argued that ''stare decisis'' itself may be unconstitutional if it requires the Court to adhere to an erroneous reading of the Constitution. "If the Constitution says X and a prior judicial decision says Y, a court has not merely the power, but the obligation, to prefer the Constitution." In the same vein, Professors Ahkil Amar and Vikram Amar have stated, "Our general view is that the Rehnquist Court's articulated theory of ''stare decisis'' tends to improperly elevate judicial doctrine over the Constitution itself." It does so, they argue, "by requiring excessive deference to past decisions that themselves may have been misinterpretations of the law of the land.

For Lawson, Akhil Amar, and Vikram Amar, dismissing erroneous horizontal precedent would not be judicial activism; instead, it would be appropriate constitutional decisionmaking.|Walton Myers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case law in common-law systems===
In the [[common-law]] tradition, courts decide the law applicable to a case by interpreting statutes and applying precedent, which record how and why prior [[Legal case|cases]] have been decided. Unlike most civil-law systems, [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common-law]] systems follow the doctrine of ''stare decisis'', by which most courts are bound by their own previous decisions in similar cases, and all lower courts should make decisions consistent with previous decisions of higher courts.&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/CivilLaw.pdf/$file/CivilLaw.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501215549/http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/CivilLaw.pdf/$file/CivilLaw.pdf |archive-date=2013-05-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example in England, the [[High Court]] and the [[Court of Appeal]] are each bound by their own previous decisions, but the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] is able to deviate from its earlier decisions, although in practice it rarely does so.

Generally speaking, higher courts do not have direct oversight over day-to-day proceedings in lower [[court of record|courts]], in that they cannot reach out on their own initiative (''sua sponte'') at any time to reverse or overrule decisions of the lower courts. Normally, the burden rests with litigants to appeal rulings (including those in clear violation of established case law) to the higher courts. If a judge acts against precedent and the case is not [[appeal]]ed, the decision will stand.

A lower court may not rule against a binding precedent, even if the lower court feels that the precedent is unjust; the lower court may only express the hope that a higher court or the legislature will reform the rule in question. If the court believes that developments or trends in legal reasoning render the precedent unhelpful, and wishes to evade it and help the law evolve, the court may either hold that the precedent is inconsistent with subsequent authority, or that the precedent should be "distinguished: by some material difference between the facts of the cases.  If that decision goes to appeal, the appellate court will have the opportunity to review both the precedent and the case under appeal, perhaps overruling the previous case law by setting a new precedent of higher authority. This may happen several times as the case works its way through successive appeals. [[Lord Denning]], first of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court of Justice]], later of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], provided a famous example of this evolutionary process in his development of the concept of [[estoppel]] starting in the ''High Trees'' case: ''[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v. High Trees House Ltd]]'' [1947] K.B. 130.

Judges may refer to various types of persuasive authority to reach a decision in a case. Widely cited nonbinding sources include legal [[encyclopedia]]s such as ''[[Corpus Juris Secundum]]'' and ''[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]'', or the published work of the [[Law Commission]] or the [[American Law Institute]]. Some bodies are given statutory powers to issue guidance with persuasive authority or similar statutory effect, such as the [[Highway Code]].

In federal or multijurisdictional law systems,  conflicts may exist between the various lower appellate courts. Sometimes these differences may not be resolved and  distinguishing how the law is applied in one [[district]], province, division or [[appellate court|appellate department]] may be necessary. Usually, only an appeal accepted by the [[court of last resort]] will resolve such differences, and for many reasons, such appeals are often not granted.

Any court may seek to distinguish its present case from that of a binding precedent, to reach a different conclusion. The validity of such a distinction may or may not be accepted on appeal. An appellate court may also propound an entirely new and different analysis from that of junior courts, and may or may not be bound by its own previous decisions, or in any case may distinguish the decisions based on significant differences in the facts applicable to each case.  Or, a court may view the matter before it as one of "[[Precedent#Matter of first impression|first impression]]", not governed by any controlling precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Coale &amp; Dyrek, [http://600camp.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/First-Impressions.pdf "First Impressions"], ''Appellate Advocate'' (Winter 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

When various members of a multi-judge court write separate opinions, the reasoning may differ; only the ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' of the majority becomes binding precedent.  For example, if a 12-member court splits 5-2-3-2 in four different opinions on several different issues, whatever reasoning commands seven votes on each specific issue, and the seven-judge majorities may differ issue-to-issue.  All may be cited as persuasive (though of course opinions that concur in the majority result are more persuasive than dissents).

Quite apart from the rules of precedent, the weight actually given to any reported opinion may depend on the reputation of both the court and the judges with respect to the specific issue.  For example, in the United States, the Second Circuit (New York and surrounding states) is especially respected in commercial and securities law, the Seventh Circuit (in Chicago), especially Judge Posner, is highly regarded on antitrust, and the District of Columbia  Circuit is highly regarded on administrative law,

Generally, a [[common law]] court system has [[trial court]]s, intermediate [[appellate court]]s and a [[supreme court]]. The inferior courts conduct almost all trial proceedings. The inferior courts are bound to obey precedent established by the appellate court for their jurisdiction, and all supreme court precedent.

The [[Supreme Court of California]]'s explanation of this principle is that

{{quote|[u]nder the doctrine of ''stare decisis'', all tribunals exercising inferior jurisdiction are required to follow decisions of courts exercising superior jurisdiction. Otherwise, the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' makes no sense. The decisions of this court are binding upon and must be followed by all the state courts of California. Decisions of every division of the [[California Courts of Appeal|District Courts of Appeal]] are binding upon all the justice and municipal courts and upon all the [[Superior Courts of California|superior courts of this state]], and this is so whether or not the superior court is acting as a trial or appellate court. Courts exercising inferior jurisdiction must accept the law declared by courts of superior jurisdiction. It is not their function to attempt to overrule decisions of a higher court.&lt;ref&gt;''Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/57C2d450.htm 57 Cal. 2d 450] (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An Intermediate state appellate court is generally bound to follow the decisions of the highest court of that state.

The application of the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' from a superior court to an inferior court is sometimes called ''vertical stare decisis''.

===Horizontality===

The idea that a judge is bound by (or at least should respect) decisions of earlier judges of similar or coordinate level is called horizontal ''stare decisis''.

In the [[United States federal court system]], the intermediate appellate courts are divided into thirteen "circuits," each covering some range of territory ranging in size from the District of Columbia alone up to seven states. Each panel of judges on the [[United States court of appeals|court of appeals]] for a circuit is bound to obey the prior appellate decisions of the same circuit.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Precedent of a United States court of appeals may be overruled only by the court ''[[en banc#United States Courts of Appeals|en banc]],'' that is, a session of all the active appellate judges of the circuit, or by the [[United States Supreme Court]], not simply by a different three-judge panel.

When a court binds itself, this application of the doctrine of precedent is sometimes called ''horizontal stare decisis''. The state of [[New York (state)|New York]] has a similar appellate structure as it is divided into four [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|appellate departments]] supervised by the final [[New York Court of Appeals]]. Decisions of one appellate department are not binding upon another, and in some cases the departments differ considerably on interpretations of law.

===Federalism and parallel state and federal courts===

In federal systems the division between federal and state law may result in complex interactions.  In the United States, state courts are not considered inferior to federal courts but rather constitute a parallel court system.

*  When a federal court rules on an issue of state law, the federal court must follow the precedent of the state courts, under the [[Erie doctrine]]. If an issue of state law arises during a case in federal court, and there is no decision on point from the highest court of the state, the federal court must either attempt to predict how the state courts would resolve the issue by looking at decisions from state appellate courts, or, if allowed by the constitution of the relevant state, [[certified question|submit]] the question to the state's courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.law.lsu.edu/toddbruno/mandatory_v__persuasive.htm |title=Mandatory v.

* On the other hand, when a state court rules on an issue of federal law, the state court is bound only by rulings of the Supreme Court, but not by decisions of federal district or circuit courts of appeals&lt;ref name="40 Cal. 4th 1370, 1416"&gt;''People v. Leonard'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/40C4t1370.htm 40 Cal. 4th 1370, 1416] (2007) (Ninth Circuit decisions do not bind Supreme Court of California).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/tlr51&amp;div=41&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=51 Texas Law Review 1972-1973 Binding Effect of Federal Declaratory Judgments on State Courts Comment |publisher=Heinonline.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United States federal courts]]&lt;/ref&gt;  However some states have adopted a practice of considering themselves bound by rulings of the court of appeals embracing their states, as a matter of comity rather than constitutional obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Colin E. |last=Wrabley|title=Applying Federal Court of Appeals’ Precedent: Contrasting Approaches to Applying Court of Appeals’ Federal Law Holdings and Erie State Law Predictions, 3 Seton Hall Circuit Rev. 1 (2006)|url=http://m.reedsmith.com/files/Publication/f2d6419f-4ea8-4b31-a1f2-e2c5752ac77d/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/84ab3eeb-9a19-419c-9776-009a4e40288a/Wrabley.pdf|format=PDf|website=m.reedsmith.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, however, judges in one system will almost always choose to follow relevant case law in the other system to prevent divergent results and to minimize [[forum shopping]].

===Binding precedent===

Precedent that must be applied or followed is known as ''binding precedent'' (alternately ''metaphorically precedent'', ''mandatory'' or ''binding authority'', etc.). Under the doctrine of ''stare decisis'', a [[lower court]] must honor findings of law made by a higher court that is within the appeals path of cases the court hears. In state and federal courts in the United States of America, jurisdiction is often divided geographically among local trial courts, several of which fall under the territory of a regional appeals court. All appellate courts fall under a highest court (sometimes but not always called a "supreme court"). By definition, decisions of lower courts are not binding on courts higher in the system, nor are appeals court decisions binding on local courts that fall under a different appeals court. Further, courts must follow their own proclamations of law made earlier on other cases, and honor rulings made by other courts in disputes among the parties before them pertaining to the same pattern of facts or events, unless they have a strong reason to change these rulings (see [[Law of the case]] re: a court's previous holding being binding precedent for that court).

In [[law]], a binding precedent (also known as a mandatory precedent or binding authority) is a precedent which must be followed by all [[lower court]]s under [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] [[Legal systems of the world|legal systems]]. In [[English law]] it is usually created by the decision of a higher court, such as the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], which took over the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords]] in 2009. In [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] and [[legal pluralism|pluralist]] systems precedent is not binding but [[case law]] is taken into account by the courts.

Binding precedent relies on the [[legal principle]] of ''stare decisis''. ''Stare decisis'' means to stand by things decided. It ensures certainty and consistency in the application of law. Existing binding precedent from past cases are applied in principle to new situations by analogy.

One law professor has described mandatory precedent as follows:

:Given a determination as to the governing jurisdiction, a court is "bound" to follow a precedent of that jurisdiction only if it is directly in point. In the strongest sense, "directly in point" means that: (1) the question resolved in the precedent case is the same as the question to be resolved in the pending case, (2) resolution of that question was necessary to the disposition of the precedent case; (3) the significant facts of the precedent case are also presented in the pending case, and (4) no additional facts appear in the pending case that might be treated as significant.&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie D. Rombauer, ''Legal Problem Solving: Analysis, Research and Writing'', pp. 22-23 (West Publishing Co., 3d ed. 1978). (Rombauer was a professor of law at the University of Washington.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In extraordinary circumstances a higher court may overturn or overrule mandatory precedent, but will often attempt to [[distinguish]] the precedent before overturning it, thereby limiting the scope of the precedent.

Under the U.S. legal system, courts are set up in a hierarchy. At the top of the federal or national system is the Supreme Court, and underneath are lower federal courts. The state court systems have hierarchy structures similar to that of the federal system.

The U.S. Supreme Court has final authority on questions about the meaning of federal law, including the U.S. Constitution. For example, when the Supreme Court says that the First Amendment applies in a specific way to suits for slander, then every court is bound by that precedent in its interpretation of the First Amendment as it applies to suits for slander. If a lower court judge disagrees with a higher court precedent on what the First Amendment should mean, the lower court judge must rule according to the binding precedent. Until the higher court changes the ruling (or the law itself is changed), the binding precedent is authoritative on the meaning of the law.

Lower courts are bound by the precedent set by higher courts within their region. Thus, a federal district court that falls within the geographic boundaries of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals (the mid-level appeals court that hears appeals from district court decisions from Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the Virgin Islands) is bound by rulings of the Third Circuit Court, but not by rulings in the Ninth Circuit (Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon, and Washington), since the Circuit Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction defined by geography. The Circuit Courts of Appeals can interpret the law how they want, so long as there is no binding Supreme Court precedent. One of the common reasons the Supreme Court grants [[certiorari]] (that is, they agree to hear a case) is if there is a conflict among the circuit courts as to the meaning of a federal law.

There are three elements needed for a precedent to work. Firstly, the hierarchy of the courts needs to be accepted, and an efficient system of law reporting. 'A balance must be struck between the need on one side for the [[legal certainty]] resulting from the binding effect of previous decisions, and on the other side the avoidance of undue restriction on the proper development of the law (1966 Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) by Lord Gardiner L.C.)'.

====Binding precedent in English law====
Judges are bound by the law of binding precedent in [[England and Wales]] and other [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] jurisdictions. This is a distinctive feature of the English legal system. In Scotland and many countries throughout the world, particularly in mainland Europe, civil law means that judges take case law into account in a similar way, but are not obliged to do so and are required to consider the precedent in terms of principle. Their fellow judges' decisions may be persuasive but are not binding. Under the English legal system, judges are not necessarily entitled to make their own decisions about the development or interpretations of the law. They may be bound by a decision reached in a previous case. Two facts are crucial to determining whether a precedent is binding:
# The position in the court hierarchy of the court which decided the precedent, relative to the position in the court trying the current case.
# Whether the facts of the current case come within the scope of the principle of law in previous decisions.

In a [[conflict of laws]] situation, [[jus cogens]] [[erga omnes]] norms and principles of the common law such as in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], to a varying degree in different jurisdictions, are deemed overriding which means they are used to "read down" legislation, that is giving them a particular [[purposive interpretation]], for example applying [[European Court of Human Rights]] [[jurisprudence]] of courts ([[case law]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===="Super ''stare decisis''"====

"Super ''stare decisis''" is a term used for important precedent that is resistant or immune from being overturned, without regard to whether correctly decided in the first place. It may be viewed as one extreme in a range of precedential power,&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, Michael. [http://www.law.gmu.edu/gmulawreview/issues/14-2/documents/SINCLAIR.pdf "Precedent, Super-Precedent"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704095246/http://www.law.gmu.edu/gmulawreview/issues/14-2/documents/SINCLAIR.pdf |date=2007-07-04 }}, ''George Mason Law Review'' (14 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 363) (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively, to express a belief, or a critique of that belief, that some decisions should not be overturned.

In 1976, [[Richard Posner]] and William Landes coined the term "super-precedent" in an article they wrote about testing theories of precedent by counting citations.&lt;ref&gt;Landes, William &amp; Posner, Richard. "Legal Precedent: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis", 19 ''Journal of Law and Economics'' 249, 251 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Posner and Landes used this term to describe the influential effect of a cited decision. The term "super-precedent" later became associated with different issue: the difficulty of overturning a decision.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Allison. [http://www.cato.org/pubs/scr/2006/hayward.pdf The Per Curiam Opinion of Steel: Buckley v. Valeo as Superprecedent?], ''Cato Supreme Court Review'' 195, 202, (2005-2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Rutgers professor Earl Maltz criticized the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' for endorsing the idea that if one side can take control of the Court on an issue of major national importance (as in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''), that side can protect its position from being reversed "by a kind of super-stare decisis".&lt;ref&gt;Maltz, Earl. "Abortion, Precedent, and the Constitution: A Comment on Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey", 68 ''Notre Dame L. Rev.'' 11 (1992), quoted by Rosen, Jeffrey.[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/weekinreview/30rosen.html? So, Do You Believe in 'Superprecedent'?], ''New York Times'' (2005-10-30).&lt;/ref&gt; The controversial idea that some decisions are virtually immune from being overturned, regardless of whether they were decided correctly in the first place, is the idea to which the term "super-''stare decisis''" now usually refers.

The concept of super-''stare decisis'' (or "super-precedent") was mentioned during the interrogations of Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]] and Justice [[Samuel Alito]] before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Prior to the commencement of the Roberts hearings, the chair of that committee, Senator [[Arlen Specter]] of Pennsylvania, wrote an op/ed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' referring to ''Roe'' as a "super-precedent". He revisited this concept during the hearings, but neither Roberts nor Alito endorsed the term or the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Benac, Nancy |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0913-09.htm |title=Roberts Repeatedly Dodges Roe v. Wade |agency=Associated Press |date=2005-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831121223/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0913-09.htm |archivedate=2012-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persuasive precedent===

'''Persuasive precedent''' (also '''persuasive authority''') is precedent or other legal writing that is not [[binding precedent]] but that is useful or relevant and that may guide the judge in making the decision in a current case. Persuasive precedent includes cases decided by lower courts, by peer or higher courts from other geographic jurisdictions, cases made in other parallel systems (for example, military courts, administrative courts, indigenous/tribal courts, state courts versus federal courts in the United States), statements made in [[dicta]], [[treatises]] or academic [[law reviews]], and in some exceptional circumstances, cases of other nations, treaties, world judicial bodies, etc.

In a "[[Precedent#Matter of first impression|case of first impression]]", courts often rely on persuasive precedent from courts in other [[jurisdiction]]s that have previously dealt with similar issues. Persuasive precedent may become binding through its adoption by a higher court.

In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[legal pluralism|pluralist]] systems, as under [[Scots law]], precedent is not binding but [[case law]] is taken into account by the courts.

====Lower courts====

A lower court's opinion may be considered as persuasive authority if the judge believes they have applied the correct legal principle and reasoning.

====Higher courts in other circuits====
A court may consider the ruling of a higher court that is not binding. For example, a [[United States district court|district court]] in the United States First Circuit could consider a ruling made by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] as persuasive authority.

====Horizontal courts====
Courts may consider rulings made in other courts that are of equivalent authority in the legal system. For example, an [[appellate court]] for one district could consider a ruling issued by an appeals court in another district.

====Statements made in ''obiter dicta''====

Courts may consider ''[[obiter dicta]]'' in opinions of higher courts. Dicta of a higher court, though not binding, will often be persuasive to lower courts.  The phrase ''obiter dicta'' is usually translated as "other things said", but due to the high number of judges and individual concurring opinions, it is often hard to distinguish from the ''ratio decidendi'' (reason for the decision).  For these reasons, the obiter dicta may often be taken into consideration by a court.  A litigant may also consider ''obiter dicta'' if a court has previously signaled&lt;ref&gt;Coale &amp; Couture, [http://600camp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Loud-Rules.pdf Loud Rules], 34 Pepperdine L. Rev. 3 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; that a particular legal argument is weak and may even warrant sanctions if repeated.

====Dissenting opinions====
A case decided by a multijudge panel could result in a split decision. While only the majority opinion is considered precedential, an outvoted judge can still publish a dissenting opinion.  Common patterns for dissenting opinions include:
* an explanation of how the outcome of the case might be different on slightly different facts, in an attempt to limit the holding of the majority
* planting seeds for a future overruling of the majority opinion
A judge in a subsequent case, particularly in a different jurisdiction, could find the dissenting judge's reasoning persuasive. In the jurisdiction of the original decision, however, a judge should only overturn the holding of a court lower or equivalent in the hierarchy. A district court, for example, could not rely on a [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] dissent as a basis to depart from the reasoning of the majority opinion.  However, lower courts occasionally cite dissents, either for a limiting principle on the majority, or for propositions that are not stated in the majority opinion and not inconsistent with that majority, or to explain a disagreement with the majority and to urge reform (while following the majority in the outcome).

====Treatises, restatements, law review articles====
Courts may consider the writings of eminent legal scholars in treatises, restatements of the law, and law reviews. The extent to which judges find these types of writings persuasive will vary widely with elements such as the reputation of the author and the relevance of the argument.

====Persuasive effect of decisions from other jurisdictions====
The courts of England and Wales are free to consider decisions of other jurisdictions, and give them whatever persuasive weight the English court sees fit, even though these other decisions are not binding precedent.  Jurisdictions that are closer to modern English [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] are more likely to be given persuasive weight (for example Commonwealth states such as Canada, Australia, or New Zealand).  Persuasive weight might be given to other common law courts, such as from the United States, most often where the American courts have been particularly innovative, e.g. in [[product liability]] and certain areas of [[contract]] law.

In the United States, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the concept of a U.S. court considering foreign law or precedent has been considered controversial by some parties. The Supreme Court splits on this issue. This critique is recent, as in the early history of the United States, citation of English authority was ubiquitous. One of the first acts of many of the new state legislatures was to adopt the body of English common law into the law of the state.  See [[Common law#CL Reception Statutes|here]].  Citation to English cases was common through the 19th and well into the 20th centuries.  Even in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, it is relatively uncontroversial for American state courts to rely on English decisions for matters of pure common (i.e. judge-made) law. {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Within the federal legal systems of several common-law countries, and most especially the United States, it is relatively common for the distinct lower-level judicial systems (e.g. state courts in the United States and Australia, provincial courts in Canada) to regard the decisions of other jurisdictions within the same country as persuasive precedent. Particularly in the United States, the adoption of a legal doctrine by a large number of other state judiciaries is regarded as highly persuasive evidence that such doctrine is preferred. A good example is the adoption in Tennessee of [[comparative negligence]] (replacing [[contributory negligence]] as a complete bar to recovery) by the 1992 [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] decision ''[[McIntyre v. Balentine]]'' (by this point all US jurisdictions save Tennessee, five other states, and the District of Columbia had adopted comparative negligence schemes). Moreover, in American law, the [[Erie doctrine|''Erie'' doctrine]] requires federal courts sitting in [[diversity jurisdiction|diversity actions]] to apply state substantive law, but in a manner consistent with how the court believes the state's highest court would rule in that case. Since such decisions are not binding on state courts, but are often very well-reasoned and useful, state courts cite federal interpretations of state law fairly often as persuasive precedent, although it is also fairly common for a state high court to reject a federal court's interpretation of its jurisprudence.

===Nonprecedential decisions: unpublished decisions, non-publication and depublication, noncitation rules===
{{main|Non-publication of legal opinions in the United States}}

Nonpublication of opinions, or unpublished opinions, are those decisions of courts that are not available for citation as precedent because the judges making the opinion deem the cases as having less precedential value. Selective publication is the legal process which a judge or justices of a court decide whether a decision is to be or not published in [[law reports|a reporter]]. "Unpublished" federal appellate decisions are published in the [[Federal Appendix]]. Depublication is the power of a court to make a previously published order or opinion unpublished.

[[Litigation]] that is settled out of court generates no written decision, thus has no precedential effect.  As one practical effect, the U.S. Department of Justice settles many cases against the federal government simply to avoid creating adverse precedent.

===''Res judicata'', claim preclusion, collateral estoppel, issue preclusion, law of the case===

Several rules may cause a decision to apply as narrow "precedent" to preclude future legal positions of the specific parties to a case, even if a decision is non-precedential with respect to all other parties.

====''Res judicata'', claim preclusion====

{{main|res judicata}}

Once a case is decided, the same plaintiff cannot sue the same defendant again on any claim arising out of the same facts.  The law requires plaintiffs to put all issues on the table in a single case, not split the case.  For example, in a case of an auto accident, the plaintiff cannot sue first for property damage, and then personal injury in a separate case.  This is called ''[[res judicata]]'' or [[claim preclusion]] ("'Res judicata'" is the traditional name going back centuries; the name shifted to "claim preclusion" in the United States over the late 20th century).  Claim preclusion applies regardless of the plaintiff wins or loses the earlier case, even if the later case raises a different legal theory, even the second claim is unknown at the time of the first case.  Exceptions are extremely limited, for example if the two claims for relief must necessarily be brought in different courts (for example, one claim might be exclusively federal, and the other exclusively state).

====Collateral estoppel, issue preclusion====

{{main|Collateral estoppel}}

Once a case is finally decided, any issues decided in the previous case may be binding against the party who lost the issue in later cases, even in cases involving other parties.  For example, if a first case decides that a party was negligent, then other plaintiffs may rely on that earlier determination in later cases, and need not reprove the issue of negligence.  For another example, if a patent is shown to be invalid in a case against one accused infringer, that same patent is invalid against all other accused infringers—invalidity need not be reproven.  Again,  limits and exceptions on this principle exist.  The principle is called [[collateral estoppel]] or [[issue preclusion]].

====law of the case====

{{main|law of the case}}

Within a single case, once there's been a first appeal, both the lower court and the appellate court itself will not further review the same issue, and will not re-review an issue that could have been appealed in the first appeal.  Exceptions are limited to three "exceptional circumstances:" (1) when substantially different evidence is raised at a subsequent trial, (2) when the law changes after the first appeal, for example by a decision of a higher court, or (3) when a decision is clearly erroneous and would result in a manifest injustice.  This principle is called "[[law of the case]]".

===Splits, tensions===

On many questions, reasonable people may differ.  When two of those people are judges, the tension among two lines of precedent may be resolved as follows.

====Jurisdictional splits: disagreements among different geographical regions or levels of federalism====

If the two courts are in separate, parallel jurisdictions, there is no conflict, and two lines of precedent may persist.  Courts in one jurisdiction are influenced by decisions in others, and notably better rules may be adopted over time.

====Splits among different areas of law====

Courts try to formulate the common law as a "seamless web" so that principles in one area of the law apply to other areas.  However, this principle does not apply uniformly.  Thus, a word may have different definitions in different areas of the law, or different rules may apply so that a question has different answers in different legal contexts.  Judges try to minimize these conflicts, but they arise from time to time, and under principles of 'stare decisis', may persist for some time.

====Conflicts====

===Matter of first impression===
A matter of first impression (also known as an "issue of first impression," "case of first impression," or, in [[Latin language|Latin]], as ''primae impressionis'') is an issue where the parties disagree on what the applicable law is, and there is no prior [[binding authority]], so that the matter has to be decided for the first time.  A first impression case may be a first impression in only a particular [[jurisdiction]].

By definition, a case of first impression cannot be decided by precedent.  Since there is no precedent for the court to follow, the court uses the plain language and [[legislative history]] of any statute that must be interpreted, [[judicial holding|holdings]] of other jurisdictions, [[persuasive authority]] and analogies from prior rulings by other courts (which may be higher, peers, or lower courts in the hierarchy, or from other jurisdictions), commentaries and articles by legal scholars, and the court's own logic and sense of justice.

==Contrasting role of case law in common law, civil law, and mixed systems {{Anchor|Precedent_in_civil_law}} ==

The different roles of case law in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] traditions create differences in the way that courts render decisions. Common law courts generally explain in detail the legal rationale behind their decisions, with citations of both legislation and previous relevant judgments, and often an exegesis of the wider legal principles. These are called ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' and constitute a precedent binding on other courts; further analyses not strictly necessary to the determination of the current case are called ''[[obiter dicta]]'', which have [[persuasive authority]] but are not technically binding. By contrast, decisions in civil law jurisdictions are generally very short, referring only to [[statute]]s. The reason for this difference is that these civil law jurisdictions apply legislative positivism — a form of extreme [[legal positivism]] — which holds that legislation is the only valid source of law because it has been voted on democratically; thus, it is not the judiciary's role to create law, but rather to interpret and apply statute, and therefore their decisions must reflect that.

===Civil law systems===

''Stare decisis'' is not usually a doctrine used in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, because it violates the legislative positivist principle that only the legislature may make law. Instead, the civil law system relies on the doctrine of ''[[jurisprudence constante]]'', according to which if a court has adjudicated a consistent line of cases that arrive at the same [[Holding (law)|holdings]] using sound reasoning, then the previous decisions are highly persuasive but not controlling on issues of law. This doctrine is similar to ''stare decisis'' insofar as it dictates that a court's decision must condone a cohesive and predictable result. In theory, lower courts are generally not bound by the precedents of higher courts. In practice, the need for predictability means that lower courts generally defer to the precedent of higher courts. As a result, the precedent of courts of last resort, such as the French [[Court of Cassation (France)|Cassation Court]] and the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], is recognized as being ''de facto'' binding on lower courts.

The doctrine of ''jurisprudence constante'' also influences how court decisions are structured. In general, court decisions of [[common law]] jurisdictions give a sufficient ''ratio decidendi'' as to guide future courts. The ratio is used to justify a court decision on the basis of previous case law as well as to make it easier to use the decision as a precedent for future cases. By contrast, court decisions in some civil law jurisdictions (most prominently [[France]]) tend to be extremely brief, mentioning only the relevant legislation and codal provisions and not going into the ''ratio decidendi'' in any great detail. This is the result of the legislative positivist view that the court is only interpreting the legislature's intent and therefore detailed exposition is unnecessary. Because of this, ''ratio decidendi'' is carried out by legal academics (doctrinal writers) who provide the explanations that in [[common law]] jurisdictions would be provided by the judges themselves.

In other civil law jurisdictions, such as the German-speaking countries, ''ratio decidendi'' tend to be much more developed than in France, and courts will frequently cite previous cases and doctrinal writers. However, some courts (such as [[Germany|German]] courts) have less emphasis on the particular facts of the case than [[common law]] courts, but have more emphasis on the discussion of various doctrinal arguments and on finding what the correct interpretation of the law is.

The mixed systems of the [[Nordic countries]] are sometimes considered a branch of the civil law, but they are sometimes counted as separate from the civil law tradition. In [[Sweden]], for instance, case law arguably plays a more important role than in some of the continental civil law systems. The two highest courts, the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]] (''Högsta domstolen'') and the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden|Supreme Administrative Court]] (''Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen''), have the right to set precedent which has persuasive authority on all future application of the law. Appellate courts, be they judicial (''hovrätter'') or administrative (''kammarrätter''), may also issue decisions that act as guides for the application of the law, but these decisions are persuasive, not controlling, and may therefore be overturned by higher courts.

===Mixed or bijuridical systems===

Some [[legal pluralism|mixed]] systems, such as [[Scots law]] in [[Scotland]], [[Law of South Africa|South-African law]], and the law of [[Quebec]] and [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]], do not fit into the civil vs. common law dichotomy because they mix portions of both. Such systems may have been heavily influenced by the [[common law]] tradition; however, their private law is firmly rooted in the civil law tradition. Because of their position between the two main systems of law, these types of legal systems are sometimes referred to as "mixed" systems of law. Louisiana courts, for instance, operate under both ''stare decisis'' and ''jurisprudence constante''. In South Africa, the precedent of higher courts is absolutely or fully binding on lower courts, whereas the precedent of lower courts only has persuasive authority on higher courts; horizontally, precedent is ''prima facie'' or presumptively binding between courts.

===Role of academics in civil law jurisdictions===

Law [[professor]]s in [[common law]] traditions play a much smaller role in developing case law than professors in civil law traditions. Because court decisions in civil law traditions are brief and not amenable to establishing precedent, much of the exposition of the law in civil law traditions is done by academics rather than by judges; this is called [[doctrine]] and may be published in treatises or in journals such as ''[[Recueil Dalloz]]'' in France. Historically, [[common law]] courts relied little on legal scholarship; thus, at the turn of the twentieth century, it was very rare to see an academic writer quoted in a legal decision (except perhaps for the academic writings of prominent judges such as [[Edward Coke|Coke]] and [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]). Today academic writers are often cited in legal argument and decisions as [[persuasive authority]]; often, they are cited when judges are attempting to implement reasoning that other courts have not yet adopted, or when the judge believes the academic's restatement of the law is more compelling than can be found in precedent. Thus [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] systems are adopting one of the approaches long common in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions.

==Critical analysis==

===Court formulations===

Justice Louis Brandeis, in a heavily footnoted dissent to ''Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.'', {{law report|285|U.S.|393}}, 405–411 (1932), explained (citations and quotations omitted):

:''Stare decisis'' is not ... a universal, inexorable command. "The rule of ''stare decisis'', though one tending to consistency and uniformity of decision, is not inflexible. Whether it shall be followed or departed from is a question entirely within the discretion of the court, which is again called upon to consider a question once decided."  ''Stare decisis'' is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation. But in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions. The Court bows to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate also in the judicial function. ... In cases involving the Federal Constitution the position of this Court is unlike that of the highest court of England, where the policy of ''stare decisis'' was formulated and is strictly applied to all classes of cases. Parliament is free to correct any judicial error; and the remedy may be promptly invoked.

:The reasons why this Court should refuse to follow an earlier constitutional decision which it deems erroneous are particularly strong where the question presented is one of applying, as distinguished from what may accurately be called interpreting, the Constitution. In the cases which now come before us there is seldom any dispute as to the interpretation of any provision. The controversy is usually over the application to existing conditions of some well-recognized constitutional limitation. This is strikingly true of cases under the due process clause when the question is whether a statute is unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious; of cases under the equal protection clause when the question is whether there is any reasonable basis for the classification made by a statute; and of cases under the commerce clause when the question is whether an admitted burden laid by a statute upon interstate commerce is so substantial as to be deemed direct. ...

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] has stated:

:A judicial precedent attaches a specific legal consequence to a detailed set of facts in an adjudged case or judicial decision, which is then considered as furnishing the rule for the determination of a subsequent case involving identical or similar material facts and arising in the same court or a lower court in the judicial hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;''Allegheny General Hospital v. NLRB'', 608 F.2d 965, 969-970 (3rd Cir. 1979) (footnote omitted), as quoted in ''United States Internal Revenue Serv. v. Osborne (In re Osborne)'', 76 F.3d 306, 96-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,185 (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] has stated:

:Stare decisis is the policy of the court to stand by precedent; the term is but an abbreviation of ''stare decisis et non quieta movere'' — "to stand by and adhere to decisions and not disturb what is settled". Consider the word "decisis". The word means, literally and legally, the decision. Under the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' a case is important only for what it decides — for the "what", not for the "why", and not for the "how". Insofar as precedent is concerned, ''stare decisis'' is important only for the decision, for the detailed legal consequence following a detailed set of facts.&lt;ref&gt;''United States Internal Revenue Serv. v. Osborne (In re Osborne)'', 76 F.3d 306, 96-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,185 (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael McHugh (judge)|Justice McHugh]] of the [[High Court of Australia]] in relation to precedents remarked in ''Perre v Apand'':
:[T]hat is the way of the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law]], the judges preferring to go 'from case to case, like the ancient Mediterranean mariners, hugging the coast from point to point, and avoiding the dangers of the open sea of system or science.

===Academic study===
Precedent viewed against passing time can serve to establish trends, thus indicating the next logical step in evolving interpretations of the law. For instance, if immigration has become more and more restricted under the law, then the next legal decision on that subject may serve to restrict it further still.  The existence of submerged precedent (reasoned opinions not made available through conventional legal research sources) has been identified as a potentially distorting force in the evolution of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2203392## Elizabeth Y. McCuskey, Clarity and Clarification: Grable Federal Questions in the Eyes of Their Beholders, 91 NEB. L. REV. 387, 427-430 (2012)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have recently attempted to apply [[network theory]] to precedent in order to establish which precedent is most important or authoritative, and how the court's interpretations and priorities have changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;[[James H. Fowler]] and Sangick Jeon, "The Authority of Supreme Court Precedent," Social Networks (2007), {{doi|10.1016/j.socnet.2007.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

===Development===
Early English [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law]] did not have or require the ''stare decisis'' doctrine for a range of legal and technological reasons:
*During the formative period of the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law]], the royal courts constituted only one among many fora in which in the English could settle their disputes. The royal courts operated alongside and in competition with ecclesiastic, manorial, urban, mercantile, and local courts.
*Royal courts were not organised into a hierarchy, instead different royal courts (exchequer, common pleas, king's bench, and chancery) were in competition with each other.
*Substantial law on almost all matters was neither legislated nor codified, eliminating the need for courts to interpret legislation.
*Common law's main distinctive features and focus were not substantial law, which was customary law, but procedural.
*The practice of citing previous cases was not to find binding legal rules but as evidence of custom.
*Customary law was not a rational and consistent body of rules and does not require a system of binding precedent.
*Before the printing press, the state of the written records of cases rendered the ''stare decisis'' doctrine utterly impracticable.

These features changed over time, opening the door to the doctrine of ''stare decisis'':
{{quote| By the end of the eighteenth century, the [[common law]] courts had absorbed most of the business of their nonroyal competitors, although there was still internal competition among the different [[common law]] courts themselves. During the nineteenth century, legal reform movements in both England and the United States brought this to an end as well by merging the various [[common law]] courts into a unified system of courts with a formal hierarchical structure. This and the advent of reliable private case reporters made adherence to the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' practical and the practice soon evolved of holding judges to be bound by the decisions of courts of superior or equal status in their jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=HAYEK, THE COMMON LAW, AND FLUID DRIVE|first= John |last=Hasnas|publisher= NYU Journal of Law &amp; Liberty |volume =1| pages= 92–93|url=http://faculty.msb.edu/hasnasj/GTWebSite/NYUFinal.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===United States legal system===

''Stare decisis'' applies to the [[Holding (law)|holding]] of a case, rather than to [[obiter dicta]] ("things said by the way"). As the [[United States Supreme Court]] has put it: "dicta may be followed if sufficiently persuasive but are not binding."&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/99-859.html Central ''Green Co. v. United States''], 531 U.S. 425 (2001), quoting ''Humphrey's Executor v. United States'', 295 U. S. 602, 627 (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States Supreme Court, the principle of stare decisis is most flexible in constitutional cases:

{{quote|Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. ... But in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions. ... This is strikingly true of cases under the due process clause.|sign=''Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.'', 285 U.S. 393, 406–407, 410 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=285&amp;invol=393 |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

For example, in the years 1946–1992, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed itself in about 130 cases.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Research Service,[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/scourt.html Supreme Court Decisions Overruled by Subsequent Decision] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113032452/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/scourt.html |date=2012-01-13 }} (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court has further explained as follows:

{{quote|[W]hen convinced of former error, this Court has never felt constrained to follow precedent. In constitutional questions, where correction depends upon amendment, and not upon legislative action, this Court throughout its history has freely exercised its power to reexamine the basis of its constitutional decisions.|sign=''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'', 321 U.S. 649, 665 (1944).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=search&amp;court=US&amp;case=/us/321/649.html |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The United States Supreme Court has stated that where a court gives multiple reasons for a given result, each alternative reason that is "explicitly" labeled by the court as an "independent" ground for the decision is not treated as "simply a dictum".&lt;ref&gt;See ''O'Gilvie v. United States'', 519 U.S. 79, 84 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

===English legal system===
The doctrine of binding precedent or ''stare decisis'' is basic to the English legal system. Special features of the English legal system include the following:

====The Supreme Court's ability to override its own precedent ====
The British [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], as the court of last appeal outside Scotland before it was replaced by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]], was not strictly bound to always follow its own decisions until the case ''[[London Street Tramways v London County Council]] [1898] AC 375''. After this case, once the Lords had given a ruling on a point of law, the matter was closed unless and until Parliament made a change by statute. This is the most strict form of the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' (one not applied, previously, in [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] jurisdictions, where there was somewhat greater flexibility for a court of last resort to review its own precedent).

This situation changed, however, after the issuance of the [[Practice Statement]] of 1966. It enabled the House of Lords to adapt English law to meet changing social conditions. In ''R v G &amp; R'' 2003, the House of Lords overruled its decision in ''Caldwell'' 1981, which had allowed the Lords to establish [[mens rea]] ("guilty mind") by measuring a defendant's conduct against that of a "reasonable person," regardless of the defendant's actual state of mind.

However, the Practice Statement has been seldom applied by the House of Lords, usually only as a last resort. As of 2005, the House of Lords has rejected its past decisions no more than 20 times.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} They are reluctant to use it because they fear to introduce uncertainty into the law. In particular, the Practice Statement stated that the Lords would be especially reluctant to overrule themselves in criminal cases because of the importance of certainty of that law. The first case involving criminal law to be overruled with the Practice Statement was ''[[Anderton v Ryan]]'' (1985), which was overruled by ''[[R v Shivpuri]]'' (1986), two decades after the Practice Statement. Remarkably, the precedent overruled had been made only a year before, but it had been criticised by several academic lawyers. As a result, [[Lord Bridge]] stated he was "undeterred by the consideration that the decision in ''Anderton v Ryan'' was so recent. The Practice Statement is an effective abandonment of our pretension to infallibility. If a serious error embodied in a decision of this House has distorted the law, the sooner it is corrected the better."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Jacqueline (2005). ''The English Legal System'' (4th ed.), p. 25. London: Hodder Arnold. {{ISBN|0-340-89991-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the House of Lords has remained reluctant to overrule itself in some cases; in ''R v Kansal'' (2002), the majority of House members adopted the opinion that ''R v Lambert'' had been wrongly decided and agreed to depart from their earlier decision.

====Distinguishing precedent on legal (rather than fact) grounds====
A precedent does not bind a court if it finds there was a lack of care in the original "Per Incuriam". For example, if a statutory provision or precedent had not been brought to the previous court's attention before its decision, the precedent would not be binding.

==Rules of statutory interpretation==
{{Main|Statutory interpretation}}

One of the most important roles of precedent is to resolve ambiguities in other legal texts, such as constitutions, statutes, and regulations.  The process involves, first and foremost, consultation of the plain language of the text, as enlightened by the legislative history of enactment, subsequent precedent, and experience with various interpretations of similar texts.

===Statutory interpretation in the U.K.===
A judge's normal aids include access to all previous cases in which a precedent has been set, and a good English dictionary.

Judges and barristers in the U.K use three primary rules for interpreting the law.

Under the [[literal rule]], the judge should do what the actual legislation states rather than trying to do what the judge thinks that it means. The judge should use the plain everyday ordinary meaning of the words, even if this produces an unjust or undesirable outcome. A good example of problems with this method is ''R v Maginnis'' (1987),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1987/4.html]&lt;/ref&gt; in which several judges in separate opinions found several different dictionary meanings of the word ''supply''. Another example is ''[[Fisher v Bell]]'', where it was held that a shopkeeper who placed an illegal item in a shop window with a price tag did not make an offer to sell it, because of the specific meaning of "offer for sale" in [[contract law]]. As a result of this case, Parliament amended the statute concerned to end this discrepancy.

The [[golden rule (law)|golden rule]] is used when use of the literal rule would obviously create an absurd result. There are two ways in which the golden rule can be applied: a narrow method, and a broad method. Under the narrow method, when there are apparently two contradictory meanings to the wording of a legislative provision, or the wording is ambiguous, the least absurd is to be preferred. Under the broad method, the court modifies the literal meaning in such a way as to avoid the absurd result.&lt;ref name="Lawade"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lawade.com/the-english-legal-system/statutory-interpretation/the-golden-rule/ |title=The Golden Rule |website=Lawade.com |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the latter approach is ''Adler v George'' (1964). Under the Official Secrets Act 1920 it was an offence to obstruct HM Forces "in the vicinity of" a prohibited place. Adler argued that he was not in the ''vicinity'' of such a place but was actually ''in'' it. The court chose not to read the statutory wording in a literal sense to avoid what would otherwise be an absurd result, and Adler was convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part E - The rules of statutory interpretation - The golden rule|url=http://labspace.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=415851|publisher=Labspace|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mischief rule]] is the most flexible of the interpretation methods. Stemming from ''[[Heydon's Case]]'' (1584), it allows the court to enforce what the statute is intended to remedy rather than what the words actually say. For example, in ''Corkery v Carpenter'' (1950), a man was found guilty of being drunk in charge of a carriage, although in fact he only had a bicycle.

===Statutory Interpretation in the United States===
In the United States, the courts have stated consistently that the text of the statute is read as it is written, using the ordinary meaning of the words of the statute.
*"[I]n interpreting a statute a court should always turn to one cardinal canon before all others. ... [C]ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there." ''Connecticut Nat'l Bank v. Germain'', [[Case citation|112 S. Ct. 1146, 1149]] (1992). Indeed, "[w]hen the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: 'judicial inquiry is complete.' "
*"A fundamental rule of statutory construction requires that every part of a statute be presumed to have some effect, and not be treated as meaningless unless absolutely necessary." ''Raven Coal Corp. v. Absher'', [[Case citation|153 Va. 332]], 149 S.E. 541 (1929).
*"In assessing statutory language, unless words have acquired a peculiar meaning, by virtue of statutory definition or judicial construction, they are to be construed in accordance with their common usage." ''Muller v. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc.'', [http://www.leagle.com/decision/19961706923P2d783_11695.xml/MULLER%20v.%20BP%20EXPLORATION%20(ALASKA)%20INC. 923 P.2d 783], 787–88 (Alaska 1996).

However, most legal texts have some lingering ambiguity—inevitably, situations arise in which the words chosen by the legislature do not address the precise facts in issue, or there is some tension among two or more statutes.  In such cases, a court must analyze the various available sources, and reach a resolution of the ambiguity.  The "Canons of statutory construction" are discussed in a [[Statutory interpretation|separate article]].  Once the ambiguity is resolved, that resolution has binding effect as described in the rest of this article.

==Practical application==
Although inferior courts are bound in theory by superior court precedent, in practice a judge may believe that justice requires an outcome at some variance with precedent, and may distinguish the facts of the individual case on reasoning that does not appear in the binding precedent.  On appeal, the appellate court may either adopt the new reasoning, or reverse on the basis of precedent.  On the other hand, if the losing party does not appeal (typically because of the cost of the appeal), the lower court decision may remain in effect, at least as to the individual parties.

===Judicial resistance===
Occasionally, a lower court judge explicitly states personal disagreement with the judgment he or she has rendered, but that he or she is required to do so by [[binding precedent]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1195909351234664885 ''State Oil Co. v. Khan''], 93 F.3d 1358 (7th Cir. 1996), in which Judge Richard Posner followed the applicable Supreme Court precedent, while harshly criticizing it, which led the Supreme Court to overrule that precedent in ''[[State Oil Co. v. Khan]]'', 522 U.S. 3 (1997); see also the concurring opinion of Chief Judge Walker in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1895782534423575000 ''National Abortion Federation v. Gonzalez''], 437 F. 3d 278 (2d Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Note that inferior courts cannot evade binding precedent of superior courts, but a court can depart from its own prior decisions.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=502&amp;invol=197 ''Hilton vs. Carolina Pub. Rys. Comm'n.''], 502 U.S. 197, 202, 112 S. Ct. 560, 565 (1991)("we will not depart from the doctrine of stare decisis without some compelling justification").&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural considerations===
In the United States, ''stare decisis'' can interact in counterintuitive ways with the federal and [[U.S. state|state]] court systems. On an issue of federal law, a state court is not bound by an interpretation of federal law at the district or circuit level, but is bound by an interpretation by the United States Supreme Court. On an interpretation of state law, whether [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law]] or [[statutory law]], the federal courts are bound by the interpretation of a state court of last resort, and are required normally to defer to the precedent of intermediate state courts as well{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

Courts may choose to obey precedent of international jurisdictions, but this is not an application of the doctrine of ''stare decisis'', because foreign decisions are not binding. Rather, a foreign decision that is obeyed on the basis of the soundness of its reasoning will be called ''[[persuasive authority]]'' — indicating that its effect is limited to the persuasiveness of the reasons it provides.

===Originalism===
[[Originalism]] is an approach to interpretation of a legal text in which controlling weight is given to the intent of the original authors (at least the intent as inferred by a modern judge).  In contrast, a non-originalist looks at other cues to meaning, including the current meaning of the words, the pattern and trend of other judicial decisions, changing context and improved scientific understanding, observation of practical outcomes and "what works," contemporary standards of justice, and ''stare decisis''.  Both are directed at ''interpreting'' the text, not changing it—interpretation is the process of resolving ambiguity and choosing from among possible meanings, not changing the text.

The two approaches look at different sets of underlying facts that may or may not point in the same direction--''stare decisis'' gives most weight to the newest understanding of a legal text, while originalism gives most weight to the oldest.  While they don't necessarily reach different results in every case, the two approaches are in direct tension. Originalists such as Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] argue that "''Stare decisis'' is not usually a doctrine used in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, because it violates the principle that only the legislature may make law."&lt;ref&gt;''A Matter of Interpretation''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Justice Scalia argues that America is a civil law nation, not a [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] nation. By principle, originalists are generally unwilling to defer to precedent when precedent seems to come into conflict with the originalist's own interpretation of the [[US Constitution|Constitutional]] text or inferences of original intent (even in situations where there is no original source statement of that original intent). However, there is still room within an originalist paradigm for ''stare decisis''; whenever the [[plain meaning rule|plain meaning]] of the text has alternative constructions, past precedent is generally considered a valid guide, with the qualifier being that it cannot change what the text actually says.

Originalists vary in the degree to which they defer to precedent. In his confirmation hearings, Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] answered a question from Senator [[Strom Thurmond]], qualifying his willingness to change precedent in this way:

{{quote|I think overruling a case or reconsidering a case is a very serious matter. Certainly, you would have to be of the view that a case is incorrectly decided, but I think even that is not adequate. There are some cases that you may not agree with that should not be overruled. Stare decisis provides continuity to our system, it provides predictability, and in our process of case-by-case decision-making, I think it is a very important and critical concept. A judge that wants to reconsider a case and certainly one who wants to overrule a case has the burden of demonstrating that not only is the case incorrect, but that it would be appropriate, in view of stare decisis, to make that additional step of overruling that case.|&lt;ref&gt;[[Clarence Thomas|Thomas, Clarence]] (1991). ''[U.S.] Senate Confirmation Hearings.'' qtd. by Jan Crawford Greenburg on [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/forum/june03/scotus_forum2.html PBS] (June 2003) Accessed 8 January 2007 UTC.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Possibly he has changed his mind, or there are a very large body of cases which merit "the additional step" of ignoring the doctrine; according to Scalia, "[[Clarence Thomas]] doesn't believe in stare decisis, period. If a constitutional line of authority is wrong, he would say, let's get it right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ringel, Jonathan | title= Fulton County Daily Report - The Bombshell in the Clarence Thomas Biography | publisher=www.dailyreportonline.com | year=2004 | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1090180289132 | authorlink=Jonathan Ringel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|American courts of last resort recognize a rebuttable presumption against overruling their own past decisions. In earlier eras, people often suggested that this presumption did not apply if the past decision, in the view of the court's current members, was demonstrably erroneous. But when the Supreme Court makes similar noises today, it is roundly criticized. At least within the academy, conventional wisdom now maintains that a purported demonstration of error is not enough to justify overruling a past decision. ...[T]he conventional wisdom is wrong to suggest that any coherent doctrine of stare decisis must include a presumption against overruling precedent that the current court deems demonstrably erroneous. The doctrine of stare decisis would indeed be no doctrine at all if courts were free to overrule a past decision simply because they would have reached a different decision as an original matter. But when a court says that a past decision is demonstrably erroneous, it is saying not only that it would have reached a different decision as an original matter, but also that the prior court went beyond the range of indeterminacy created by the relevant source of law. ... Americans from the Founding on believed that court decisions could help "liquidate" or settle the meaning of ambiguous provisions of written law. Later courts generally were supposed to abide by such "liquidations." ... To the extent that the underlying legal provision was determinate, however, courts were not thought to be similarly bound by precedent that misinterpreted it. ... Of the Court's current members, Justices Scalia and Thomas seem to have the most faith in the determinacy of the legal texts that come before the Court. It should come as no surprise that they also seem the most willing to overrule the Court's past decisions. ... Prominent journalists and other commentators suggest that there is some contradiction between these Justices' mantra of "judicial restraint" and any systematic re-examination of precedent. But if one believes in the determinacy of the underlying legal texts, one need not define "judicial restraint" solely in terms of fidelity to precedent; one can also speak of fidelity to the texts themselves.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Nelson, Caleb | title=Stare Decisis and Demonstrably Erroneous Precedent | publisher=Virginia Law Review, 84 Va L.

===Advantages and disadvantages===

There are disadvantages and advantages of binding precedent, as noted by scholars and jurists.

===Criticism of precedent===

In a 1997 book, attorney Michael Trotter blamed over-reliance by American lawyers on binding and persuasive authority, rather than the merits of the case at hand, as a major factor behind the escalation of [[legal costs]] during the 20th century. He argued that courts should ban the citation of persuasive precedent from outside their jurisdiction, with two exceptions:
:(1) cases where the foreign jurisdiction's law is the subject of the case, or
:(2) instances where a litigant intends to ask the highest court of the jurisdiction to overturn binding precedent, and therefore needs to cite persuasive precedent to demonstrate a trend in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Trotter, ''Profit and the Practice of Law: What's Happened to the Legal Profession'' (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1997), 161-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

The disadvantages of ''stare decisis'' include its rigidity, the complexity of learning law, the differences between some cases may be very small and appear illogical, and the slow growth or incremental changes to the law that are in need of major overhaul.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

An argument often used against the system is that it is [[democracy|undemocratic]] as it allows judges, which may or may not be elected, to make law.&lt;ref&gt;https://isistatic.org/journal-archive/ma/14_01/mcclellan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding constitutional interpretations, there is concern that over-reliance on the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' can be subversive. An erroneous precedent may at first be only slightly inconsistent with the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], and then this error in interpretation can be propagated and increased by further precedent until a result is obtained that is greatly different from the original understanding of the Constitution. ''Stare decisis'' is not mandated by the Constitution, and if it causes unconstitutional results then the historical evidence of original understanding can be re-examined. In this opinion, predictable fidelity to the Constitution is more important than fidelity to unconstitutional precedent. See also the [[living tree doctrine]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Agreement with precedent===

A counter-argument (in favor of the advantages of ''stare decisis'') is that if the [[legislature]] wishes to alter the case law (other than constitutional interpretations) by [[statute]], the legislature is empowered to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Berland, David (2011). Note, [http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2011/2/Berland.pdf "Stopping the Pendulum: Why Stare Decisis Should Constrain the Court from Further Modification of the Search Incident to Arrest Exception"]. University of Illinois Law Review (2011 U. Ill. L. Rev. 695).&lt;/ref&gt; Critics{{who|date=April 2014}} sometimes accuse particular judges of applying the doctrine selectively, invoking it to support precedent that the judge supported anyway, but ignoring it in order to change precedent with which the judge disagreed.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

There is much discussion about the virtue of using ''stare decisis''. Supporters of the system, such as [[Minimalism (Judicial)|minimalists]], argue that obeying precedent makes decisions "predictable". For example, a business person can be reasonably assured of predicting a decision where the facts of his or her case are sufficiently similar to a case decided previously. This parallels the arguments against retroactive (ex post facto) laws banned by the U.S. Constitution.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The '''principle of nonvacuous contrast''' is a logical or methodological principle which requires that a genuine predicate never refer to everything, or to nothing, within its [[universe of discourse]].

'''Ralph Monroe Eaton''' (June 28, 1892 – April 13, 1932) was an American philosopher of [[Harvard University]] whose career was cut short when he killed himself at the age of 39. He specialised in the theory of knowledge and logic but later became interested in psychoanalysis. He served in the United States Army during the First World War and wrote an unpublished memoir of his experiences.

== Early life and marriage ==
Ralph Monroe Eaton was born on June 28, 1892, in [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], California. He was educated at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (Litt. B., 1914) and Harvard University (A.M., 1915 and Ph.D., 1917).&lt;ref name=gf /&gt; He married and had a daughter but the marriage was not a success.&lt;ref name=kuk /&gt;

== First World War ==
Eaton applied for admission to the [[Citizens' Military Training Camp|Officers' Training Camp]] at [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh, New York]] in early 1917 and was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]]. He was posted to the [[103rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|103rd Infantry Regiment]] and travelled to France with the [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th "Yankee" Division]]. He served as an officer of the line and was promoted to first lieutenant in which capacity he was responsible for the regimental supply company. His regiment saw action at [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel|Saint-Mihiel]] and in the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive|Argonne]].&lt;ref name=east&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1483025 "Eastern Division"], ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'', Vol. 6 (1932), pp. 209–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he wrote an unpublished memoir of his experiences, ''Backward glances of a demobilized soldier'', in which he described the "romance in modern warfare ... a saga of vaster proportions than ever before; a tremendous drama of men and mechanisms"&lt;ref name=wash /&gt; but also of his first experience of death in war when his sergeant:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...lay like a beautiful slaughtered animal, this boy whom I had loved and had beside me, his gashed and bloody head supported in the trembling arms of a comrade. He opened pained eyes and spoke my name, as I felt his shivering body for the more fatal wound which I knew he must have in the chest. And then, when he had been lifted to a stretcher, after they had carried him away to the dressing station, I went into my abri [bunker] and wept as I have not wept before or since. A day later we buried him at Vaucresson.&lt;ref name=wash&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2001/11/11/called-upon-to-have-courage/a5b52116-dcbb-43ab-97a7-6da62b06c4fc/ Called Upon To Have Courage.] ''The Washington Post'', November 11, 2001. Retrieved November 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Academic career ==
Eaton began his career as assistant in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] from 1915 to 1916, rising to assistant professor in 1926, after the interruption of military service. He was also an assistant professor at [[Radcliffe College]].&lt;ref name=gf /&gt;

He was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] in 1926, awarded for a study of the "philosophy, particularly the theory of knowledge in its relation to logic and metaphysics, with Professor E. Husserl and the phenomenological school of German philosophers, principally at the University of Freiburg, Germany; and for the writing in English of a critical account of the philosophy of this school".&lt;ref name=gf&gt;[http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/ralph-monroe-eaton/ Ralph Monroe Eaton.] John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Retrieved October 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

His first interests were in the [[scientific method]] and [[logic]]&lt;ref name=east /&gt; and his first book, ''Symbolism and Truth'' (1925), was an [[epistemological]] study that used logic to explore philosophy. It was compared to [[Wittgenstein]]'s ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]'' in its preoccupations. In ''General Logic'' (1931), Eaton dealt with [[symbolic logic]] as well as the [[Aristotelian logic|Aristotelian]] idea of logic and [[inductive logic]]. On the basis of the works, Harvard promoted Eaton to associate professor in February 1930, but soon afterwards he was found drunk in his room, depressed over the failure of his marriage, and with obscenities marked on the walls by his companions. As a result, in March the university withdrew his promotion, declared him emotionally unstable, and put him on leave until the start of the 1931–32 academic year. In addition, his contract as an assistant professor was not renewed at the end of that academic year.&lt;ref name=kuk&gt;[[Bruce Kuklick|Kuklick, Bruce]]. (1977) ''The rise of American philosophy: Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1860–1930''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]]. pp. 438–9. {{ISBN|978-0-300-02039-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, he became interested in [[psychoanalysis]] and the break from his Harvard duties allowed him to translate and write a preface to ''Secret Ways of the Mind'' by [[Wolfgang Müller Kranefeldt]], with an introduction by [[Carl Jung]], which was published in early 1932.&lt;ref name=notes /&gt;

==Death==
In April 1932, Eaton dismissed a class at Radcliffe due to dizziness. At the insistence of friends, he checked into a hospital for a night, but escaped the next morning. A group of colleagues found his body in a forest in [[West Concord, Massachusetts|West Concord]], where he had cut his throat.&lt;ref name=notes&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2015536 "Notes and News"], ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'', Vol. 29, No. 10 (May 12, 1932), p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Blake.

[[File:Shout gnangarra.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A round or Shout of drinks arriving at the table]]

A '''round of drinks''' is a set of [[alcoholic beverage]]s purchased by one person in a group for that complete group. The purchaser buys the round of drinks as a single order at the bar. In many places it is customary for people to take turns buying rounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirc.org/publik/pub.html  SIRC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roundrules.com  Round Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a nearly [[wiktionary:ubiquitous|ubiquitous]] custom in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]].  In Australia and New Zealand it is referred to as '''shouting'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianbeers.com/culture/shouting.htm|title=Shouting|work=australianbeers.com|accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This practice is also customary in many parts of [[North America]], especially in areas where people with cultural roots in Ireland and the UK predominate.
A notable exception was the UK [[State Management Scheme]] in which treating (i.e. buying a round) was forbidden, from July 1916 until June 1919.

==Australia==
In [[John O'Grady (writer)|John O'Grady]]'s ''[[They're a Weird Mob]]'', Nino learns some customs related to shouting.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Your turn.''
:''What is my turn?''
Your turn to shout''
:''Why should I shout?''
Because I shouted you.''
:''I did not hear you shout at me.''
He thought for a while and said, I get it. When you buy a bloke a beer, it's called a shout, see?''
:''Why is that?''
I haven't a clue, but that's what it's called. I shouted for you, now it's your turn to shout for me.''
:''I was only a little thirsty. I do not think I wish another drink.''
He looked quite stern, In this country, if you want to keep out of trouble, you always return a shout, see?''
:''Is this the custom?''
Bloody oath, it's the custom. Your turn.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==United States==
In the culture of the [[United States Military]], possession of a [[challenge coin]] can be used to determine who buys a round of drinks.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} One individual of a group lays down their coin, and all else present must lay down their coins as well. Anyone who does not have a coin with them must buy a round. If everyone can produce a coin, the challenger must buy a round.

'''Rüdiger Bubner''' (9 May 1941, [[Lüdenscheid]] – 9 February 2007, [[Heidelberg]]) was a [[Germany|German]] philosopher. Since 1996, he was professor at [[Heidelberg]]. He was also member of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and honorary member of the Theological Faculty of the University of Fribourg. His main areas of specialisation were [[aesthetics]] and practical philosophy with reference to [[Ancient philosophy]], [[German Idealism]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/presse/news07/2702letz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Works in English include ''Modern German Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1981, {{ISBN|0-521-29711-7}})
and ''The Innovation of Idealism'' (Cambridge University Press 2003), in which he examines [[German Idealism]] and its historical heritage.

[[File:StephaneLupasco.jpg|thumb|Stéphane Lupasco]]
'''Stéphane Lupasco''' (born '''Ştefan Lupaşcu'''; 11 August 1900 – 7 October 1988) was a [[Romania]]n [[philosopher]] who developed [[non-Aristotelian logic]].

==Early years==
Stéphane Lupasco was born in [[Bucharest]] on 11 August 1900. His family belonged to the old [[Moldavia]]n [[aristocracy]]. His father was a lawyer and politician, but it was his mother, a pianist and student of [[César Franck]], who established the family in [[Paris]] in 1916. After high school at the [[Lycée Buffon]], he studied [[philosophy]], [[biology]] and [[physics]] at the [[Sorbonne]] and, briefly, [[law]]. He participated fully in the artistic and intellectual life of Paris in the 20s and 30s and defended his State Doctoral Thesis in 1935.

==Academic career==
In 1946, he was named Research Assistant at the [[French National Science Research Centre]], a post he was obliged to leave ten years later because of the inability of the Centre to decide in which Scientific Section his work belonged! The next ten or fifteen years were those of greatest acceptance of his work by the public and other thinkers, but unfortunately not by mainstream logicians and philosophers. His ''Trois Matières'', published in 1960 was a bestseller, and people began calling Lupasco the [[Descartes]], the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], the [[Hegel]] of the 20th Century, a new [[Claude Bernard]], a new [[Bergson]], etc. He continued to publish books in the 70s and 80s, the last being ''L’Homme et ses Trois Ethiques'' in 1986, two years before his death on October 7, 1988 in Paris. An Award of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1984 was among the few honors that came to Lupasco during his lifetime. Lupasco was one of the founding members of the International Center for Transdisciplinary Research (Centre International de Recherches et Etudes Transdisciplinaires (CIRET)), founded in Paris in 1987 by [[Basarab Nicolescu]], [[Edgar Morin]], [[René Berger]], [[Michel Random]] and other key figures of the French intelligentsia. As Nicolescu has recalled, Lupasco was deeply affected by the stubborn resistance of the academic community to honest debate and discussion of his new principles and postulates, and it is with an understandable bitterness that Lupasco saw in this resistance another example of the operation of his principles.

==Summary of work==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2011}}
Lupasco’s style as an author is not an easy one, and requires the uninterrupted attention of the reader. It is not infrequent to find sentences of almost a page in length, containing multiply nested clauses. His writing is extremely dense in terms of the ideas and meaning of each successive phrase, with only occasional illustrative examples. Lupasco makes many references to his prior publications, unfortunately, often without adequate indexation. As Nicolescu has remarked, Lupasco’s exclusion from French academic life had both advantages and disadvantages: Lupasco was freed from the constraints of teaching and publication of research papers in a rigid format, and he obviously did not find it necessary to apply the discipline of providing references to his sources. In the ''Psychic Universe'', published when Lupasco was seventy-nine, one sees nothing about current work in psychiatry. (Lupasco unfortunately did not read English well, and hence no references to the “anti”-psychiatry of [[R. D. Laing]] and [[Gregory Bateson]], close in spirit to his work, are to be found.) A recent study by Brenner (2008) up-dates Lupasco’s work and shows its relevance to current issues in science and philosophy, as well as logic.

==Influence==
Lupasco was not well served by the (few) exegetes that had looked closely at his work. Only one book, by the sociologist [[Marc Beigbeder]], presents both a substantial description of Lupasco’s theory and development of it as a “logic of society”. A brief monograph by the philosopher [[Benjamin Fondane]], dating from 1944 (just prior to his deportation and death) and published in 1998, discusses the limitations of Lupasco’s view of [[affectivity]] and [[ontology]]. A book by an obscure English artist, [[George Melhuish]], uses Lupasco’s ideas to develop his own concept of the structure of the universe, a sympathetic but not very rigorous reading of his work. Aside from Nicolescu's personal library it has been claimed that access to these and several other texts  are otherwise unavailable. A complete understanding of, for example, Lupasco’s analysis of those precursors that [[André Glucksmann]] has called “Les Maîtres Penseurs” – [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]], [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Marx]] – must be sought in several different books. The attention of the reader is rewarded, however, by Lupasco’s regular restatements of his basic theses, often in a way that is more economic, meaningful and coherent.

In his introduction to Lupasco’s ''The Principle of Antagonism and the Logic of Energy'', Nicolescu points out that once the reader gets beyond the (relatively few) mathematical formulas in this book, Lupasco’s language is perfectly accessible. “It exemplifies, in a self-referential manner, the ternary aspects of actualization, potentialization and included middle which give it the charm and the privilege of incantations that are at the same time scientific, philosophical and poetic.”

Summarizing briefly, stimulated by [[Einstein]]'s works and [[quantum]] theory, Lupasco founded a new [[logic]], questioning the ''[[tertium non datur]]'' principle of classical logic. He introduced a third state, going beyond the [[String duality|duality]] principle, the T-state. The T-state is  neither 'actual', nor 'potential' (categories replacing in Lupasco's system the 'true' or 'false' values of standard bivalent logic), but a resolution of the two contradictory elements at a higher level of reality or complexity. Lupasco generalised his logic to [[physics]] and [[epistemology]] and above all to a new theory of [[consciousness]].

==Recent studies==
A key reference in French is the compendium of 1999, "Stéphane Lupasco -The Man and the Work" by H. Badescu and B. Nicolescu. The first comprehensive update and comparison of Lupasco's thought in English is the 2008 book by J. E. Brenner, "Logic in Reality". Other useful new references are the combined papers of a Symposium on Lupasco in 2009 "At the Confluence of Two Cultures: Lupasco Today," in French and a biographical paper by Brenner, "The Philosophical Logic of Stéphane Lupasco (1900 - 1988)" in English.

'''Thorsten Botz-Bornstein''' (born 1964) is a [[Germany|German]] philosopher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tidningenkulturen.se/artiklar/ess-mainmenu-57/riga-mainmenu-130/3915-wilhelm-sesemann-en-spegel-av-europas-frrade-situation|title=Wilhelm Sesemann – en spegel av Europas förvirrade situation|last=Wirth|first=Michael|date=November 12, 2011|work=Tidningen Kulturen|language=Swedish|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; specializing in [[aesthetics]] and [[intercultural philosophy]].

== Biography ==
Botz-Bornstein was born in Germany in 1964, studied philosophy in Paris from 1985 to 1990, and received his Ph.D. from [[Oxford University]] in 1993. As a postdoctoral researcher based in Finland he undertook extensive research on Russian formalism and semiotics in Russia and the Baltic countries. In 2000 he received  his 'habilitation' from the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|EHESS]] of Paris. He has also been researching in Japan, in particular on the [[Kyoto School]], and worked for the Center of Cognition of [[Hangzhou University]] (China) as well as at [[Tuskegee University]] in Alabama. He is now Associate Professor of philosophy at [[Gulf University for Science and Technology]] in Kuwait.

== Philosophy ==
In his philosophy he attempts to establish conceptual links between style, play, and dream. He does so by borrowing elements from non-Western philosophies (Russian, Japanese, Chinese), architecture, and the aesthetics of cinema. Linked to his central research on the phenomenon of style is his research on Japanese philosophy. One of his early starting points (1992) has been [[Kuki Shūzō]]’s notion of 'iki' which Botz-Bornstein interpreted as an idea related to Western elaborations of the term style. He has been interested in comparisons of Nishida Kitaro with Western authors like Bakhtin and Wittgenstein. Other topics are Pan-Asianism, Eurasianism and Pan-Slavism and corresponding reflections on the 'cultural sphere,' international world order, etc. Botz-Bornstein is also working on the idea of the 'virtual' in aesthetics and cultural theory as well as about meta-philosophical questions of 'ethno-philosophy.'

'''''Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority''''' ({{lang-fr|Totalité et Infini: essai sur l'extériorité}}) is a 1961 work of [[philosophy]] by [[Emmanuel Levinas]]. It is one of his early works, highly influenced by [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

==Summary==

===The Other===
Levinas advances the thesis that all ethics derive from a confrontation with an other. This other, with whom we interact concretely, represents a gateway into the more abstract Otherness.

The distinction between totality and infinity divides the limited world, which contains the other as a material body, from a spiritual world. Subjects gain access to this spiritual world, infinity, by opening themselves to the Otherness of the other. For example:

{{quote|To approach the other in conversation is to welcome his expression, in which at each instant he overflows the idea a thought would carry away from it. It is therefore to receive from the Other beyond the capacity of the I, which means exactly: to have the idea of infinity. (p. 51)}}

===Presence===

Levinas places heavy emphasis on the physical presence involved in meeting the other. He argues that only a [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] encounter allows true connection with Infinity, because of the incessance of this type of interaction. Written words and other words do not suffice because they have become past by the time the subject perceives them. That is: they have fallen into the register of totality.

[[Jacques Derrida]], in "Violence and Metaphysics," takes Levinas to task for this assumption, arguing characteristically that writing might be at least as sacred as speech.

===History===
The book contains several observations on [[History]] and the judgement of history, like "the judgement of history is always pronounced by default."&lt;ref&gt;Didier Pollefeyt (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bAl6kZ985EIC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43 ''Incredible forgiveness''], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status within philosophy==

''Totality and Infinity'' is considered an original and significant contribution to the world of philosophy—[[continental philosophy]] in particular. The work can be read as a response to Levinas's teachers, [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Britannica both identify ''Totality and Infinity'', along with ''[[Otherwise Than Being]]'' as one of Levinas's most important works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emmanuel Levinas|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/levinas/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Totality and Infinity|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1308494/continental-philosophy/274658/Levinas?anchor=ref978089|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Utilitarian bioethics''' is a branch of [[utilitarian ethics]] and [[bioethics]] that recommends directing medical resources where they will have most long-term effect for good.

It is implicitly used in some healthcare planning decisions, such as the use of [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs) and the concept of [[triage]], but is controversial in many other cases.

==History==

Although utilitarian philosophy traces itself back to the nineteenth century British thinkers [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]], the application of these principles to contemporary bioethics originated in the work of [[Peter Singer]] in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Fetal Tissue and Fine Lines; New Technologies Test the Power of Utilitarian Principles, [[The Washington Post]], Sept. 20, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;  A second generation of utilitarian bioethicists, including [[Julian Savulescu]], [[Jacob M. Appel]] and [[Thaddeus Mason Pope]], advanced these arguments further in the 1990s and 2000s.  Among applications of the utilitarian bioethic in policy are the [[Groningen Protocol]] in the [[Netherlands]] and the [[Advance Directives Act]] in the American state of Texas.

In the 1990s, a backlash against utilitarian bioethics emerged, led by such figures as  [[Wesley J. Smith]] and novelist [[Dean Koontz]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Kathy.  One Door Away From Heaven', ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'', Feb 14, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colon, Alicia.  "When Killing An Ill Infant 'Is Not Wrong, ''The New York Sun'', December 3, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic argument==
Utilitarian bioethics is based on the premise that the distribution of resources is a [[zero-sum]] game, and therefore medical decisions should logically be made on the basis of each person's total future productive value and happiness, their chance of survival from the present, and the resources required for treatment.  

For those whose cost of medical treatment or maintenance outweighs their total future economic value (because they are terminally ill, are no longer productive, and have no reasonable chance of becoming productive or happy in the foreseeable future), it is economically efficient to free up medical resources by not treating them.  

As an example of this logic, every nurse who cares for a terminally ill Alzheimer's or cancer patient, a comatose individual, or an individual in a vegetative state, is one less nurse to take care of a sick baby or a 12-year-old gunshot victim.  See [[opportunity cost]].

Therefore, the benefits of utilitarian bioethics include increased medical expenditure on other patients with a higher chance of survival and return to a productive and/or happy status. This would ideally lead to an overall net increase in wealth and happiness. 

The perceived disadvantage of utilitarian bioethics include: potential justifications for physicians to kill patients, a gravitation towards acceptance of mortality and death, lack of medical progress (as the treatment of severe injuries would not be explored), the uncertainty in measuring 'happiness', and the possibility of classification of many disabled or old people as "[[nonperson]]s".

In [[conservation biology]], '''susceptibility''' is the extent to which an organism or ecological community would suffer from a threatening process or factor if exposed, without regard to the likelihood of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srex/SREX-Chap2_FINAL.pdf|first1= J. |last1=Birkmann|display-authors=etal|publisher= Cambridge University Press|date=2012|pages= 65-108}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with '''vulnerability''', which takes into account both the effect of exposure ''and'' the likelihood of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vulnerability|url=https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~nabo/meetings/glthec/materials/simpson/GEC_sdarticle2.pdf|first1=W. Neil |last1=Adger|journal=Global Environmental Change |volume=16 |date=2006|pages=268–281|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a plant species may be highly susceptible to a particular plant disease, meaning that exposed populations invariably become extinct or decline heavily. However, that species may not be vulnerable if it occurs only in areas where exposure to the disease is unlikely, or if it occurs over such a wide distribution that exposure of all populations is unlikely. Conversely, a plant species may show low susceptibility to a disease, yet may be considered vulnerable if the disease is present in every population.
