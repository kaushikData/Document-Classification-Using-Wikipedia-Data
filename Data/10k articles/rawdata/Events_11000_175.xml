This edition of the [[Flying Broom International Women's Film Festival]], which was founded in 1997 and is organized by Flying Broom with support from the [[Çankaya, Ankara|Çankaya]] municipality in Ankara and accredited by [[FIPRESCI]], had the theme of ''evil'' and focused on the problems of women (including prostitutes, migrant women, poor women and lesbians). The festival opened with a ceremony at the Ankara State Opera and Ballet Hall on May 6, 2010 at which honorary awards were presented to actresses [[Lale Belkıs]] and [[Gülsen Tuncer]], and art director [[Deniz Özen]], who attended the special screening of Turkish classic ''[[Unmade Bed (film)|Unmade Bed]]'' ({{lang-tr|Dağınık Yatak}}) directed by [[Atıf Yılmaz]].

The '''2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference''', '''COP 21''' or '''CMP 11''' was held in [[Paris]], France, from 30 November to 12 December 2015. It was the 21st yearly session of the [[United Nations Climate Change conference|Conference of the Parties]] (COP) to the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and the 11th session of the Meeting of the Parties (CMP) to the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=19th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC|url=http://climate-l.iisd.org/events/conference-of-the-parties-to-the-unfccc/|publisher=[[International Institute for Sustainable Development]]|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference negotiated the [[Paris Agreement]], a global agreement on the reduction of [[climate change]], the text of which represented a consensus of the representatives of the 196 parties attending it.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/12/world/global-climate-change-conference-vote/ |title=Final draft of climate deal formally accepted in Paris |last1=Sutter |first1=John D. |last2=Berlinger |first2=Joshua |date=12 December 2015 |website=CNN |publisher=Cable News Network, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. |access-date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement will enter into force when joined by at least 55 countries which together represent at least 55 percent of global greenhouse emissions.&lt;ref name="FCCC_CP_2015_L9_Rev1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20151128"&gt;{{cite news |author=The Editorial Board |title=What the Paris Climate Meeting Must Do |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/opinion/sunday/what-the-paris-climate-meeting-must-do.html |date=28 November 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=28 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Borenstein |first=Seth |title=Earth is a wilder, warmer place since last climate deal made |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20151129/eu-climate-countdown-since-1997-edf9d62e51.html |date=29 November 2015 |accessdate=29 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 April 2016 (Earth Day), 174 countries signed the agreement in New York,
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Pamela Falk|title=U.S. joins 174 nations to sign hard-won climate pact|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-climate-pact-un-signing-ceremony-paris-agreement-cop21/|website=CBSNEWS|accessdate=9 November 2016|date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began adopting it within their own legal systems (through [[Ratification#Ratification of an international treaty|ratification]], acceptance, approval, or accession).

According to the organizing committee at the outset of the talks,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/learn/what-is-cop21/ What is COP21?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210193406/http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/learn/what-is-cop21/ |date=10 December 2015 }} access date 30 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; the expected key result was an agreement to set a goal of limiting [[global warming]] to "well below 2 °C" [[Celsius]] compared to pre-industrial levels. The agreement calls for zero net anthropogenic [[greenhouse gas]] emissions to be reached during the second half of the 21st century. In the adopted version of the Paris Agreement,&lt;ref name="FCCC_CP_2015_L9_Rev1"/&gt; the parties will also "pursue efforts to" limit the temperature increase to 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; The 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C goal will require zero emissions sometime between 2030 and 2050, according to some scientists.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

Prior to the conference, 146 national climate panels publicly presented draft national climate contributions (called "[[Intended Nationally Determined Contribution]]s", INDCs). These suggested commitments were estimated to limit global warming to 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.unfccc.int/unfccc-newsroom/indc-synthesis-report-press-release/ New UN Report Synthesizes National Climate Plans from 146 Countries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208121907/http://newsroom.unfccc.int/unfccc-newsroom/indc-synthesis-report-press-release/ |date=8 December 2015 }}, UNFCCC 30 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[EU]] suggested INDC is a commitment to a 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Latvia/1/LV-03-06-EU%20INDC.pdf Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of the EU and its Member States], 6 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement establishes a "global stocktake" which revisits the national goals to "update and enhance" them every five years beginning 2023.&lt;ref name="FCCC_CP_2015_L9_Rev1"/&gt; However, no detailed timetable or country-specific goals for emissions were incorporated into the Paris Agreement – as opposed to the previous [[Kyoto Protocol]].

A number of meetings took place in preparation for COP21, including the [[Bonn]] Climate Change Conference, 19 to 23 October 2015, which produced a draft agreement.&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Co2-1990-2012.svg|thumb|350px|Shows the top 40 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitting countries and related in the world in 1990 and 2012, including per capita figures. The data is taken from the [http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=CO2ts1990-2013 EU Edgar database].]]

According to the organizing committee of the summit in Paris, the objective of the 2015 conference was to achieve, for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, a binding and universal agreement on climate, from all the nations of the world.&lt;ref name=dipl&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy-1/sustainable-development-1097/21st-conference-of-the-parties-on/article/issues-and-reasons-behind-the | title=Issues and reasons behind the French offer to host the 21st Conference of the Parties on Climate Change 2015 | publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs | date=22 May 2013 | accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Pope Francis]] published an encyclical called ''[[Laudato si']]'' intended, in part, to influence the conference. The encyclical calls for action against climate change{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. The [[International Trade Union Confederation]] has called for the goal to be "zero carbon, zero poverty", and its general secretary [[Sharan Burrow]] has repeated that there are "no jobs on a dead planet".

==Location and participation==
[[File:JCH 6442 (22802505643).jpg|thumb|left|The heads of delegations from left to right: [[Enrique Peña Nieto]], [[François Hollande]], [[Angela Merkel]], [[Michelle Bachelet]].]]

The location of UNFCCC talks is rotated by regions throughout [[United Nations]] countries. The 2015 conference was held at [[Le Bourget]] from 30 November&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy-1/sustainable-development-1097/21st-conference-of-the-parties-on/article/france-confirmed-as-host-of-2015 | title=France confirmed as host of 2015 Climate Conference | publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs | date=22 November 2013 | accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 11 December 2015.

To some extent, France served as a model country for delegates attending COP21 because it is one of the few developed countries in the world to decarbonize electricity production and fossil fuel energy while still providing a high standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;Guivarch, Celine and Hallegatte, S., 2C or Not 2C? 19 January 2012. FEEM Working Paper No. 87.2011. {{DOI|10.2139/ssrn.1988201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2012, France generated over 90% of its electricity from zero carbon sources, including nuclear, hydroelectric, and wind.

The conference took place two weeks after a [[November 2015 Paris attacks|series of terrorist attacks]] in central Paris. Security was tightened accordingly, with 30,000 police officers and 285 security checkpoints deployed across the country until after the conference ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://time.com/4113215/paris-attacks-climate-conference/ |title=Paris Climate Conference to Proceed with Heightened Security After Attacks |date=November 14, 2015 |last=Worland |first=Justin |publisher=Time Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union and 195 nations (''see list in reference'')&lt;ref name=unfcc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/status_of_ratification/items/2631.php|title=Status of Ratification of the Convention|accessdate=15 Dec 2015|publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; were the participating parties.

==Negotiations==
[[File: GUSTAVO-CAMACHO-GONZALEZ-L1060274 (23430273715).jpg|thumb|COP 21: Heads of delegations.]]

The overarching goal of the Convention is to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions to limit the global temperature increase. Since COP 17 this increase is set at {{convert|2|C-change}} above pre-industrial levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schedule of Events |url=http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/warsaw_nov_2013/application/pdf/cop19cmp9_overview_schedule.pdf |publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |accessdate=12 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112055835/http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/warsaw_nov_2013/application/pdf/cop19cmp9_overview_schedule.pdf |archivedate=12 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Christiana Figueres]] acknowledged in the closing briefing at the [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2012 Doha conference]]: "The current pledges under the second commitment period of the Kyoto protocol are clearly not enough to guarantee that the temperature will stay below 2&amp;nbsp;°C and there is an ever increasing gap between the action of countries and what the science tells us."

During previous climate negotiations, countries agreed to outline actions they intended to take within a global agreement, by 1 October 2015. These commitments are known as [[Intended Nationally Determined Contributions]] or INDCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wri.org/indc-definition |title=What is an INDC? &amp;#124; World Resources Institute |publisher=Wri.org |date=10 November 2015 |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the INDCs would reduce global warming from an estimated 4–5&amp;nbsp;°C (by 2100) to 2.7&amp;nbsp;°C, and reduce emissions per capita by 9% by 2030, while providing hope in the eyes of the conference organizers for further reductions in the future that would allow meeting a 2&amp;nbsp;°C target.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Nuttall, [http://newsroom.unfccc.int/unfccc-newsroom/indc-synthesis-report-press-release/ Global Response to Climate Change Keeps Door Open to 2 Degree C Temperature Limit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208121907/http://newsroom.unfccc.int/unfccc-newsroom/indc-synthesis-report-press-release/ |date=8 December 2015 }}, UNFCCC press office, 30 Oct 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Think-tanks such as the [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] argued that the keys to success lay in convincing officials in the U.S. and China, by far the two largest national emitters:
"As long as policy makers in Washington and Beijing didn't put all their political capital behind the adoption of ambitious carbon-emission capping targets, the laudable efforts of other G20 governments often remained in the realm of pious wishes. Things changed for the better on 12 November 2014 when President Obama and General Secretary Xi Jinping agreed to limit greenhouse gases emissions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=M.

President [[Obama]] insisted on America's essential role in that regard: "We've led by example […] from Alaska to the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains [...] we've seen the longest streak of private job creation in our history. We've driven our economic output to all time-highs while driving our carbon pollution down to its lowest level in nearly two decades. And then, with our historic joint announcement with China last year, we showed it was possible to bridge the old divide between developed and developing nations that had stymied global progress for so long […] That was the foundation for success in Paris."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=President Obama |title=President Obama's Statement on Climate Change |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/climate-change |accessdate=30 December 2015 |work=White House Briefing Room |date=12 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228111409/https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate-change |archive-date=28 December 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==
{{main|Paris Agreement}}
On 12 December 2015, the participating 196 countries agreed, by consensus, to the final&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/12/12/459464621/final-draft-of-world-climate-agreement-goes-to-a-vote-in-paris-saturday |title=Nearly 200 Nations Adopt Climate Agreement At COP21 Talks In Paris|last1=Chappel|first1=Bill |date=12 December 2015 |website=NPR |access-date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; global pact, the [[Paris Agreement]], to reduce emissions as part of the method for reducing greenhouse gas. In the 12-page document,&lt;ref name="FCCC_CP_2015_L9_Rev1"/&gt; the members agreed to reduce their carbon output "as soon as possible" and to do their best to keep global warming "to well below 2 degrees C".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/cop21-climate-change-talks-saturday-announced-1.3362354 |title='Historic' Paris climate deal adopted |author=no byline |date=12 December 2015 |website=CBC News |publisher=CBC/Radio Canada |access-date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the debates, island states of the Pacific, the Seychelles, but also the Philippines, their very existence threatened by sea level rise, had strongly voted for setting a goal of 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C instead of only 2&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Pacific countries that need the Paris 1.5C temperature rise agreement to 'stay alive' |date=12 December 2015 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/cop21-the-marshall-islands-and-other-pacific-countries-paris-need-the-15c-temperature-rise-agreement-a6770766.html|newspaper=Independent|location=London, England |access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will '1.5 to stay alive' deal be enough to save Seychelles?|date=12 December 2015 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/climate-change-seychelles-cop21-economy-collapse|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London, England |access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
France's Foreign Minister, [[Laurent Fabius]], said this "ambitious and balanced" plan was an "historic turning point" in the goal of reducing global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-summit-idUSKBN0TV04L20151212#gVKudBATCD0EGdxL.97 |title=World seals landmark climate accord, marking turn from fossil fuels |last1=Doyle |first1=Allister |last2=Lewis |first2=Barbara |date=12 December 2015 |website=Reuters |publisher=Thomson Reuters |access-date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some others criticized the fact that significant sections are "promises" or aims and not firm commitments by the countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Milman |first=Oliver |date=12 December 2015 |title=James Hansen, father of climate change awareness, calls Paris talks 'a fraud' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/james-hansen-climate-change-paris-talks-fraud |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, England |access-date=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-binding commitments, lack of enforcement mechanisms===
The Agreement will not become binding on its member states until 55 parties who produce over 55% of the world's greenhouse gas have ratified the Agreement. There is doubt whether some countries, especially the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pengelly |first=Martin |date=December 12, 2015 |title=Obama praises Paris climate deal as 'tribute to American leadership' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/12/obama-speech-paris-climate-change-talks-deal-american-leadership |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, England |access-date=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; will agree to do so, though the United States publicly committed, in a joint Presidential Statement with China, to joining the Agreement in 2016.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

Each country that ratifies the agreement will be required to set a target for emission reduction or limitation, called a "nationally determined contribution," or "NDC," but the amount will be voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/12/world/global-climate-change-conference-vote/index.html?eref=rss_topstories |title=Obama: Climate agreement 'best chance we have' to save the planet |last1=Sutter |first1=John D. |last2=Berlinger |first2=Joshua |date=December 12, 2015 |website=CNN |publisher=CNN Network, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. |access-date=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20151214"/&gt; There will be neither a mechanism to force&lt;ref&gt;

Some analysts have also observed that the stated objectives of the Paris Agreement are implicitly "predicated upon an assumption – that [[member states of the United Nations]], including high polluters such as China, US, India, Canada, Russia, Indonesia and Australia, which generate more than half the world's greenhouse gas emissions, will somehow drive down their carbon pollution voluntarily and assiduously without any binding enforcement mechanism to measure and control CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions at any level from factory to state, and without any specific penalty gradation or fiscal pressure (for example a [[carbon tax]]) to discourage bad behaviour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=M.

Firzli |title=Investment Governance: The Real Fight against Emissions is Being Waged by Markets|url= http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2016-01-25/un-climate-conference-cop21-laurent-fabius-carbon-emissions-calpers-calstrs|work=Dow Jones Financial News|date=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional investors' contribution to limiting fossil fuels===
Speaking at the [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|5th annual World Pensions Forum]] held on the sidelines of the COP21 Summit, [[Earth Institute]] Director [[Jeffrey Sachs]] argued that [[institutional investor]]s would eventually divest from carbon-reliant firms if they could not react to political and regulatory efforts to halt climate change: "Every energy company in a [[pension fund]]'s portfolio needs to be scrutinized from purely a financial view about its future, 'Why is this [a company] we would want to hold over a five- to 20-year period?'... If we continue to hold major energy companies that don't have an answer to a basic financial test, we are just gambling. We have to take a [[fiduciary]] responsibility – these are not good bets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Andrew Pearce|title= Jeffrey Sachs: Fund Managers Have a Duty to Dump Fossil Fuels|url=http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2015-12-07/sachs222 |accessdate=16 December 2015|work=Financial News|date=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some US policy makers concurred, notably [[Al Gore]], insisting that "no agreement is perfect, and this one must be strengthened over time, but groups across every sector of society will now begin to reduce dangerous carbon pollution through the framework of this agreement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=John Vidal|title= Paris Climate Agreement 'May Signal End of Fossil Fuel Era'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-agreement-signal-end-of-fossil-fuel-era|accessdate=16 December 2015|work=The Guardian|date=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is usual before such major conferences, major NGOs and groups of governments have drafted and published a wide variety of declarations they intend to seek a consensus on, at the Paris conference itself. These include at least the following major efforts:

==Demonstrations==

Around the world, 600,000 took part in demonstrations in favour of a strong agreement, such as the [[Global Climate March]] organized by [[350.org]] (and other events such as [[Alternatiba, Village of Alternatives]]). Paris had a ban on public gatherings in the wake of [[November 2015 Paris attacks|recent terrorist attacks]] ([[State of emergency in France|state of emergency]]), but allowed thousands to demonstrate on 12 December against what they felt was a too-weak treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Organisers of events include [http://anv-cop21.org/ Non-violent action COP21], see {{YouTube|hhxPRGp-5jo|Rassemblement Champ-de-Mars 12 décembre 2015 [Gathering at the Champ-de-Mars on 12 December 2015]}}.

The top shows of the night were ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[Hill Street Blues]]''. ''Cheers'' won its second straight Emmy for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]], while ''Hill Street Blues'' made history. It became the first show to win the Emmy for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]] four consecutive years. This record still stands today, but has been tied twice, by ''[[The West Wing]]'' and ''[[Mad Men]]''. ''Hill Street Blues'' also added to another streak. It received at least 14 major nominations for the fourth straight year, winning four. ''Cheers'' received the most nominations on the comedy side (10), winning three.

[[Laurence Olivier|Sir Laurence Olivier]] won the last of his five career Emmys this evening. His win was also the last time a [[Broadcast syndication|non-Network Syndicated]] performance won an Acting Award.

The '''Aftermath of the Winter War''' covers historical events and comments after the [[Winter War]] between [[Finland]] and the [[Soviet Union]] from 30 November 1939 to 13 March 1940. The short period after the war and before the next, the [[Continuation War]], is known as the [[Interim Peace]].

==After the war==

===Finnish views===
The 105-day war had a profound and depressing effect in Finland. Useful international support was minimal, arrived late, and the German blockade prevented most armament shipments.&lt;ref name="Edwards15"&gt;[[#Edwards2006|Edwards 2006]], pp. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war, the situation of the Finnish army on the Karelian Isthmus had been the [[Karelian question|subject of some debate]]. The orders were already given to prepare a retreat to the next line of defence in the Taipale sector. The estimates of how long the enemy could have been held in these kinds of retreat-and-stand operations varied from a few days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laaksonen |first1=Lasse |authorlink1= |title= Todellisuus ja harhat |year=2005  |origyear=1999 |publisher=Ajatus kirjat |isbn=951-20-6911-3 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a couple of months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Halsti |first1=Wolfgang Hallstén |authorlink1= |title= Talvisota 1939–1940 |year=1955  |publisher=Otava |isbn= |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; most averaging around a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paasikivi |first1=Juho Kusti |authorlink1=Juho Kusti Paasikivi |title= Toimintani Moskovassa |year=1959  |publisher=WSOY |isbn= |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Interim Peace]], Karelian local governments, parishes and provincial organizations established [[Karjalan Liitto]], an interest group, in order to defend the rights and interests of Karelian evacuees and to find a solution for [[Karelian question in Finnish politics|returning Karelia]].

===Soviet views===
During the period between the war and the [[perestroika]] in late 1980s, [[Soviet historiography]] leaned solely on Vyacheslav Molotov's speeches on the Winter War. In his radio speech of 29 November 1939, Molotov argued that the Soviet Union had tried for two months to negotiate guarantees of security for Leningrad. However, the Finns had taken a hostile stance to "please foreign imperialists". The Finns had [[Shelling of Mainila|undertaken military provocation]] and the Soviets could no longer hold to nonaggression pacts. According to Molotov, the Soviets did not want to occupy or annex Finland; the goal was purely to secure Leningrad.&lt;ref name="talvisodanpikkujattilainen-vihavainen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Vihavainen | first=Timo |editor1-first=Jari |editor1-last=Leskinen |editor2-first=Antti |editor2-last=Juutilainen |title=Talvisodan pikkujättiläinen |year=1999 |pages=893–896 |chapter=Talvisota neuvostohistoriakirjoituksessa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source, later used widely in Soviet historiography, was the Molotov speech in front of the Supreme Soviet on 29 March 1940. Molotov blamed Western countries for starting the war and argued that they had used Finland as a proxy to fight the Soviet Union. The Western Allies had furthermore tried to take neutral Sweden and Norway along with them. The main "villains" for the Soviets were the United Kingdom and France, but also Sweden, the United States, and Italy, who had issued massive amounts of matériel, money, and numbers of men, to Finland. According to Molotov, the Soviet Union was merciful in peace terms, as the problem of Leningrad security had been solved.&lt;ref name="talvisodanpikkujattilainen-vihavainen" /&gt;

It is speculated that Stalin had practically wiped out his intelligence apparatus during the purges, thus damaging the effectiveness of spies in Finland and other countries, as well as cowing operatives into writing the kind of reports they thought Stalin wanted to read.  Thus, he was not aware of the real situation in Finland and amongst the Allies.&lt;ref name="VanDyke1997"&gt;[[#VanDyke1997|Van Dyke 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rentola"&gt;Rentola, Kimmo, ''
[http://www.ennenjanyt.net/4-02/rentola.htm Residenttimme ilmoittaa...]'', Suomen Historiallinen Seura, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet intelligence sources were informing their leadership of Allied plans to intervene in the war, but not of the details or the Allies' actual unpreparedness. Therefore, the Soviets felt forced to seek a premature end to the war before the Allies intervened and declared war on the Soviet Union.

In 1948, Stalin wrote in ''[[Falsifiers of History]]'' that "there could hardly be any doubt that the leading circles of Finland were in league with the Hitlerites and that they wanted to turn Finland into a springboard for Hitler Germany's attack on the U.S.S.R."&lt;ref&gt;[[#SovietInformationBureau1948|Soviet Information Bureau 1948]], p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the start of the war, Stalin also wrote, "In the war which the Finnish reactionaries started against the Soviet Union, Britain and France rendered the Finnish militarists every kind of assistance. The Anglo-French ruling circles kept inciting the Finnish Government to continue hostilities."&lt;ref&gt;[[#SovietInformationBureau1948|Soviet Information Bureau 1948]], p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikita Khrushchev]], who had been a [[party leader]] during the war, remembered later on: "In our war against the Finns we could choose the location of the war and the date of its start. In number we were superior to the enemy, we had enough time to get ready for the operation. But on these most favourable terms we could only win through huge difficulties and incredibly great losses. In fact this victory was a moral defeat. Our people certainly never got knowledge of it because we never told them the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heller |first1=Mihail |last2=Nyekrics |first2=Alekszandr |authorlink1= |title= Orosz történelem, II. kötet: A Szovjetunió története |year=2003 |publisher=Osiris Publ. Ltd. |location=Budapest |language=Hungarian |ISBN=963-389-546-4 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the President of Russia, [[Boris Yeltsin]], denounced the Winter War, agreeing that it was a [[war of aggression]].&lt;ref&gt;In a joint press conference with President of Finland Martti Ahtisaari at Kremlin 18 May 1994. (See: {{cite web |last=Nevalainen |first=Pekka |title= Many Karelias |url= http://newsroom.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=25907 |date= November 2001 |work= |publisher=Virtual Finland |accessdate=20 August 2009}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The Winter War was a success for the Germans. Both the Red Army and the League of Nations were humiliated and furthermore, the Allied Supreme War Council had been revealed to be chaotic and powerless. However, the German policy of neutrality was not popular in the homeland and relations with Italy had also suffered badly. After the Peace of Moscow, the Germans did not hesitate to move to improve ties, and within two weeks, Finno-German relations were at the top of the agenda.&lt;ref name="Edwards16"&gt;[[#Edwards2006|Edwards 2006]], pp. 277–279&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Interim Peace]], the Finns gradually moved closer to the Germany to fend of the perceived Soviet aggression and the Soviet interference into the Finnish domestic politics. Later Finland came to perceive the co-operation with Germany as a chance to reclaim areas ceded to the Soviet Union. Two days after the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, Soviet–Finnish hostilities resumed with start of the [[Continuation War]].

===Western Allies===
The Winter War put in question the organisation and effectiveness of not only the Red Army, but also that of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. The [[Supreme War Council]] did not manage its way through the situation, but revealed its total unsuitability to make effective war in either Britain or France. This failure led to the collapse of the [[Édouard Daladier|Daladier government]] in France, and later, after the failure in the [[Norwegian Campaign]], the fall of [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain government]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Edwards2"&gt;[[#Edwards2006|Edwards 2006]], pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military consequences===
The Supreme Military Soviet met in April 1940, sifted through the lessons of the Finnish campaign, and recommended reforms. The role of frontline political commissars was reduced and old-fashioned ranks and forms of discipline were reintroduced. Clothing, equipment and tactics for winter operations were improved. However, not all of these reforms had been completed when the Germans started [[Operation Barbarossa]] fourteen months later.&lt;ref name="Trotter20" /&gt;

In summer 1940, the Soviet Union [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupied the Baltic states]] of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.&lt;ref name="talvisodanpikkujattilainen-turtola2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Turtola | first=Martti |editor1-first=Jari |editor1-last=Leskinen |editor2-first=Antti |editor2-last=Juutilainen |title=Talvisodan pikkujättiläinen |year=1999 |page=847 |chapter=Katkera rauha ja Suomen ulkopoliittinen asema sodan jälkeen}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1940, the Finns and Swedes successfully negotiated a military alliance, but the negotiations ended once it became clear that both Germany and the Soviet Union opposed such an alliance.&lt;ref name="talvisodanpikkujattilainen-turtola20"&gt;{{cite book |last=Turtola | first=Martti |editor1-first=Jari |editor1-last=Leskinen |editor2-first=Antti |editor2-last=Juutilainen |title=Talvisodan pikkujättiläinen |year=1999 |page=863 |chapter=Katkera rauha ja Suomen ulkopoliittinen asema sodan jälkeen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties of the war==
During the four months of fighting, the Soviet Army suffered massive losses. One Red Army General, looking at a map of the territory just conquered, is said to have remarked: "We have won just about enough ground to bury our dead." The official Soviet figure, issued just after the war, listed 48,745 dead and 150,863 wounded.&lt;ref name="Trotter20"&gt;[[#Trotter2002|Trotter 2002]], pp. 263–270&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Nikita Khrushchev]], 1.5 million men were sent to Finland and one million of them were killed, while 1,000 aircraft, 2,300 tanks and armored cars and an enormous amount of other war materials were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maddock |first=Robert K. |title=The Finnish Winter War |url=http://www.kaiku.com/winterwar.html |date=1 March 2007 |work= |publisher=Kutri's Corner |accessdate=24 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302160341/http://www.kaiku.com/winterwar.html |archivedate=2 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mosier, John, ''The Blitzkrieg Myth: How Hitler and the Allies Misread the Strategic Realities of World War II'', HarperCollins, 2004, {{ISBN|0-06-000977-2}}, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Finland's losses were limited to 25,904 dead or missing&lt;ref name="pikkujattilainen-kurenmaalentila"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kurenmaa | first1=Pekka |last2=Lentilä | first2=Riitta |editor1-first=Jari |editor1-last=Leskinen |editor2-first=Antti |editor2-last=Juutilainen |title=Jatkosodan pikkujättiläinen |year=2005 |pages=1150–1162 |chapter=Sodan tappiot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 43,557 wounded.&lt;ref name="talvisodanpikkujattilainen-lentilajuutilainen"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lentilä | first1=Riitta |last2=Juutilainen | first2=Antti |editor1-first=Jari |editor1-last=Leskinen |editor2-first=Antti |editor2-last=Juutilainen |title=Talvisodan pikkujättiläinen |edition= |publisher= |year=1999 |page=821 |chapter=Talvisodan uhrit |language= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, professor Mikhail Semiryaga used the Red Army [[Casualty Notification]]s to publish a book in which he gave exact figures: 53,522 dead, 16,208 missing, 163,772 wounded and 12,064 frostbitten. Meanwhile, professor N. I. Baryshikov estimated 53,500 dead, a figure close to that of Semiryaga. In 1999, the Finnish historian [[Ohto Manninen]] estimated Red Army casualties to have been 84,994 dead or prisoners, 186,584 wounded or disabled, 51,892 sick and 9,614 frostbitten.&lt;ref name="talvisodanpikkujattilainen-manninen2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Manninen | first=Ohto |editor1-first=Jari |editor1-last=Leskinen |editor2-first=Antti |editor2-last=Juutilainen |title=Talvisodan pikkujättiläinen |year=1999 |pages=811–815 |chapter=Venäläiset sotavangit ja tappiot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian historian [[Grigoriy Krivosheyev]] calculated 126,875 dead and 264,908 wounded.&lt;ref name="Krivosheyev"&gt;{{cite book | last=Krivosheyev | first=Grigoriy | authorlink=Grigoriy Krivosheyev | publisher=Greenhill Books | year=1997 | title=Soviet Casualties and Combat Losses in the Twentieth Century | edition=1st | url=http://www.soldat.ru/doc/casualties/book/chapter4_8.html | isbn=1-85367-280-7 | access-date=13 September 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329013351/http://www.soldat.ru/doc/casualties/book/chapter4_8.html | archive-date=29 March 2010 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the professor of the Petrozavodsk State University [[Yuri Kilin]] calculated 63,990 dead, 207,538 wounded and frostbites, making total casualties 271,528, and furthermore 58,390 men were tagged as sick.&lt;ref name="talvisodanpikkujattilainen-kilin1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilin | first=Juri | authorlink=Yuri Kilin |editor1-first=Jari |editor1-last=Leskinen |editor2-first=Antti |editor2-last=Juutilainen |title=Talvisodan pikkujättiläinen |year=1999 |page=381 |chapter=Puna-armeijan Stalinin tahdon toteuttajana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary views==

===Soviet literature===
The Winter War was one of the first modern wars of the Red Army before Nazi Germany's [[Operation Barbarossa|Barbarossa]] in June 1941. In the Soviet Union, the Winter War was called the "Soviet-Finnish War", and later the term "Border Skirmish" was also used. In different periods the Soviet literature gave different answers for basic questions of the motive of the war, who started the war, whether it could have been avoided, and the result. The most important aspect was the motive.&lt;ref name="Jokisipila2007-1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilin | first=Juri | authorlink=Yuri Kilin |editor1-first=Markku |editor1-last=Jokisipilä |title=Sodan totuudet |year=2007 |pages=37–38 |chapter=Leningradin sotilaspiirin rahakahakka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first motive of the war, presented by the Soviets, was to assist the Finnish working-class people against the tyranny of the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Finns]]. The root was the [[Finnish Civil War]] in which thousands of [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] were killed, and the many communist leaders were expatriated from Finland to the Soviet Union. The motive did not work as the Finnish working-class stood by its legal government in Helsinki. The Soviets abandoned this motive at the end of the December 1939.&lt;ref name="Jokisipila2007-2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilin | first=Juri | authorlink=Yuri Kilin |editor1-first=Markku |editor1-last=Jokisipilä |title=Sodan totuudet |year=2007 |page=40 |chapter=Leningradin sotilaspiirin rahakahakka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new motive was introduced by the [[Stavka]] at turn of the year. Now, the protection of [[Leningrad]] and North-East of the area was the main motive. During winter 1940 the British and the France [[Franco-British plans for intervention in the Winter War|planned intervention]], which Soviet propaganda used to show that the Western imperialists were willing to use Finland as springboard against the "Socialist Motherland".&lt;ref name="Jokisipila2007-3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilin | first=Juri | authorlink=Yuri Kilin |editor1-first=Markku |editor1-last=Jokisipilä |title=Sodan totuudet |year=2007 |pages=40–43 |chapter=Leningradin sotilaspiirin rahakahakka}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Nazi Germany assault against the Soviet Union, the literature changed its course. Now, the main villain of the Winter War was Germany. The Finns had sold their country to Hitler, and for years they had planned the attack against the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the Soviet literature argued that the [[Mannerheim Line]] was built on Germany's initiative and using its experts.&lt;ref name="Jokisipila2007-4"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilin | first=Juri | authorlink=Yuri Kilin |editor1-first=Markku |editor1-last=Jokisipilä |title=Sodan totuudet |year=2007 |pages=43–44 |chapter=Leningradin sotilaspiirin rahakahakka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], the main villain changed again. Now, the United States was the head of an alliance whose other participants were the United Kingdom, France, and Nazi Germany. The Mannerheim Line was given funding from the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Germany and the United States, and also in years 1938–1939 the Swedish, British and German generals visited and monitored construction work. These multinational contributions demonstrated that Finland was preparing the assault against the Soviet Union with "any military alliance possible".&lt;ref name="Jokisipila2007-5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilin | first=Juri | authorlink=Yuri Kilin |editor1-first=Markku |editor1-last=Jokisipilä |title=Sodan totuudet |year=2007 |pages=48–49 |chapter=Leningradin sotilaspiirin rahakahakka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian literature===
During the years of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]], the Soviet historiography began to write new views of its history. Rendition of Winter War studies had its breakthrough when the Soviet historian Mikhail Semiryaga wrote an article for the weekly magazine ''[[Ogoniok]]'' in 1989. It was the first time the public read that the Winter War was a real war, not just a conflict, and that the Soviet government had had to deploy a large number of men and amount of matériel. Furthermore, Semiryaga wrote that the Soviets began their troop deployments in the spring of 1939. Later he wrote an article in which he revealed that the goal of the Red Army was not just to secure Leningrad, but to conquer the whole of Finland.&lt;ref name="Jokisipila2007-8"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilin | first=Juri | authorlink=Yuri Kilin |editor1-first=Markku |editor1-last=Jokisipilä |title=Sodan totuudet |year=2007 |pages=83–84 |chapter=Rajakahakan hidas jäiden lähtö}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s and 2000s, especially after the Moscow Archives opened, there have been hundreds of articles considering the Winter War. However, only dozens of [[monograph]]s have been published. Due to the language barrier, most Russian historians have not exploited Finnish writings and sources.&lt;ref name="Jokisipila2007-9"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilin | first=Juri | authorlink=Yuri Kilin |editor1-first=Markku |editor1-last=Jokisipilä |title=Sodan totuudet |year=2007 |pages=85–86 |chapter=Rajakahakan hidas jäiden lähtö}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s there was the beginning of a transition in which old Soviet views were mixed with modern ones. The Soviet diplomat and KGB-agent in Helsinki [[Viktor Vladimirov (intelligence officer)|Viktor Vladimirov]] wrote ''Kohti talvisotaa'' in 1995, a book in which he admitted that the [[Shelling of Mainila]] was a Soviet provocation, but insisted that the Finns had an assault plan against the Soviet Union; that Finland was under German influence; and that the Winter War was necessary to secure the city of Leningrad.&lt;ref name="Jokisipila2007-10"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilin | first=Juri | authorlink=Yuri Kilin |editor1-first=Markku |editor1-last=Jokisipilä |title=Sodan totuudet |year=2007 |pages=87–88 |chapter=Rajakahakan hidas jäiden lähtö}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, a group of Finnish-Russian historians published a book called ''Zimnyaya voina 1939–1940''. It was a collection of different historical articles, and the book was published a year earlier in Finnish.&lt;ref name="Jokisipila2007-11"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilin | first=Juri | authorlink=Yuri Kilin |editor1-first=Markku |editor1-last=Jokisipilä |title=Sodan totuudet |year=2007 |page=92 |chapter=Rajakahakan hidas jäiden lähtö}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a general economic upturn in the early 2000s, commercial war literature publishing became popular again. Pavel Aptekar wrote ''Tainy finskoi voiny'' in 2000 and ''Sovetsko-finskiye voiny'' in 2004, in which he emphasized the Finnish side and describes the Soviet assault as "immoral".&lt;ref name="Jokisipila2007-12"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilin | first=Juri | authorlink=Yuri Kilin |editor1-first=Markku |editor1-last=Jokisipilä |title=Sodan totuudet |year=2007 |pages=95–96 |chapter=Rajakahakan hidas jäiden lähtö}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Pavel Petrov and Viktor Stepakov wrote a 542-page long book called ''Sovetsko-finlandsjaya voina 1939–1940'', in which they negate the myth of a major Nazi-German influence on Finnish foreign policy, and demonstrate that the United Kingdom had a bigger role.&lt;ref name="Jokisipila2007-13"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilin | first=Juri | authorlink=Yuri Kilin |editor1-first=Markku |editor1-last=Jokisipilä |title=Sodan totuudet |year=2007 |pages=97–98 |chapter=Rajakahakan hidas jäiden lähtö}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more "traditional" literature has also been published, such as ''Rozdeniye i krah'' by Nikolai Baryshnikov and Vladimir Baryshikov in 2000. The authors revive Soviet views, and for example are not sure which party started the Shelling of Mainila. The book was also published in Finnish by the [[Johan Beckman Institute]].&lt;ref name="Jokisipila2007-14"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilin | first=Juri | authorlink=Yuri Kilin |editor1-first=Markku |editor1-last=Jokisipilä |title=Sodan totuudet |year=2007 |page=98 |chapter=Rajakahakan hidas jäiden lähtö}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finnish literature===
During the age of [[Finlandization]], the Finnish president [[Urho Kekkonen]] gave a speech in April 1973 in which he stated that Winter War was unnecessary. This view was received positively in the Kremlin and among the Finnish leftists. Similar opinions were presented by the Swedish prime minister [[Tage Erlander]] and Finnish novelist [[Väinö Linna]]. Kekkonen's views were objected to as the Winter War was traditionally beyond criticism in Finnish society. However the Continuation War could be criticized openly in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Jokisipila2007-6"&gt;{{cite book |last=Vares | first=Vesa |editor1-first=Markku |editor1-last=Jokisipilä |title=Sodan totuudet |year=2007 |page=183 |chapter=Kuitenkin me voitimme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 50th anniversary of the Winter War started a new era in 1989. At the same year the film ''[[Talvisota (film)|Talvisota]]'' (Winter War) was released which was the most expensive Finnish movie at the time. At the beginning of the 1990s the atmosphere changed. The Soviet Union collapsed and Moscow Archives opened revealing new information about the Winter War. The Finns openly showed their respect for the Finnish soldiers of three wars in 1939–1944; the situation would have been impossible in the 1970s. In the 2004 television programme ''[[Suuret suomalaiset]]'' (Great Finns) the Finns voted three World War II persons in the top four: [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] (1st), [[Risto Ryti]] (2nd), and [[Adolf Ehrnrooth]] (4th).&lt;ref name="Jokisipila2007-7"&gt;{{cite book |last=Vares | first=Vesa |editor1-first=Markku |editor1-last=Jokisipilä |title=Sodan totuudet |year=2007 |pages=184–185 |chapter=Kuitenkin me voitimme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible Sovietisation and resettlement===
In the years since the Winter War, there has been speculation surrounding Finnish–Soviet negotiations during 1938 and 1939. Could the Winter War have been avoided, if Finland had agreed to Soviet demands for bases and to conclude the friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance treaty between countries? Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had agreed to Soviet demands and a year later were occupied and annexed. Could Finland have been an exception?&lt;ref name="Ex Virtual Finland"&gt;{{cite web |last=Vihavainen |first=Timo |title=Finland, Stalin and Germany in the 1930s |url= http://newsroom.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=25928 |date=December 2001 |work= |publisher=Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, Department for Communication and Culture/Unit for Public Diplomacy |accessdate=30 August 2009 – see also Vihavainen at www.thisisFinland.fi [http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=160097&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060814015913/http://newsroom.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=25928 |archivedate = 14 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Finnish historian [[Timo Vihavainen]], there are many arguments against these speculations. Stalin trusted only the Red Army, and he used it to consolidate his control of neighbouring countries. Pieces of paper like nonaggression pacts interested him little. Neutrality, when it ran counter to the interests of the Soviet Union, was "objectively" its opposite and therefore served the interests of Germany. The Soviet Union accused Finland being under total German influence in 1930s. This has been convincingly shown by Finnish historians{{Who|date=December 2009}} to be a myth. The same applies to Finnish public opinion and the press, in which the general attitude towards Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union was overwhelmingly negative.&lt;ref name="Ex Virtual Finland"/&gt;

There has also been speculation about Soviet intent: did the Soviets really try to occupy all of Finland, or just strategic areas near Leningrad? According to the document approved in 1939 by Zhdanov, Molotov, and Kuusinen, the Finnish [[political system]] was meant to be [[Sovietisation|changed]] after the Soviet occupation by establishing a people's republic and capturing "enemies of the state". Marshal [[Ivan Konev]] wrote that he was informed of a conversation between Stalin, Kliment Voroshilov, and [[Ivan Isakov]]. Stalin said in the beginning of the Winter War: "We shall have to resettle the Finns... the population of Finland is smaller than that of Leningrad, they can be resettled."&lt;ref name="ManninenStalininkiusa6"&gt;[[#ManninenStalininkiusa2002|Manninen 2002]], pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radzinsky1"&gt;[[#Radzinsky1997|Radzinsky 1997]], p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable events include the Ladies' Iron Skillet Toss, the Scrapple Chunkin' Contest, and the Mayor's Scrapple Sling.  The name of the festival is derived from two agricultural products which are important to this region, apples and Scrapple.  The Apple Scrapple Festival was named one of the top 100 events in North America by the American Bus Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buses.org/files/Top100/Top%20100%202012.pdf "Top 100 Events in North America (pg 13)"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060459/http://www.buses.org/files/Top100/Top%20100%202012.pdf |date=September 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard Bailey Kerik''' (born September 4, 1955) is an American former [[police officer]], consultant and convicted felon, who served as [[New York City Police Commissioner]] from 2000 to 2001, and [[New York City]]'s Correction Department Commissioner and First Deputy, overseeing the [[New York City]] jail system, from 1995 to 2000.

Kerik was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. He served in the [[United States Army]] from 1974 to 1977 before working various law enforcement jobs in the United States and abroad. Joining the [[New York City Police Department|New York Police Department]] (NYPD) in 1986, Kerik is most well known for his time at the NYPD and [[New York City Department of Correction]], as he served in commissioner positions for both city agencies. Kerik's tenure as police commissioner included overseeing the police response to the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.

Following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], President [[George W. Bush]] appointed Kerik as the [[interior minister]] of the Iraqi [[Coalition Provisional Authority]]. In 2004, Bush nominated Kerik to be the head of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. However, Kerik soon withdrew his candidacy, explaining that he had employed an [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrant]] as a [[nanny]]. His withdrawal resulted in state and federal investigations as a result of which in 2006 Kerik pleaded guilty in Bronx Supreme Court to two unrelated ethics violations (unclassified misdemeanors) and was ordered to pay $221,000 in fines.

Kerik was born in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]], the son of Patricia Joann (Bailey) and Donald Raymond Kerik Sr. His paternal grandfather emigrated from [[Russia]] to a [[coal]]-mining town in Pennsylvania and changed his surname from Kapurik to Kerik.&lt;ref name="bookref1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kerik|first=Bernard B.|authorlink=|title=The Lost Son: A Life in Pursuit of Justice|publisher=Harper|date=September 2002|location=|pages=18–20|url=|isbn=0060508825}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2000/09/06/2000-09-06__kerik_a_veteran_of_mean_str.html |location=New York |work=Daily News |title=KERIK A VETERAN OF MEAN STREETS A career forged in fighting crime |date=September 6, 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604100124/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2000/09/06/2000-09-06__kerik_a_veteran_of_mean_str.html |archivedate=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerik was raised [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and grew up in [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. He attended [[Eastside High School (Paterson, New Jersey)|Eastside High School]] in Paterson, and dropped out in 1972. In July 1974, he enlisted in the [[United States Army]] and received a [[General Educational Development]] (GED) certificate from the State of [[North Carolina]] while assigned to [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]] .

After leaving the New York City Police Department, he received a B.S. in social theory, social structure and change, from (ESC) [[Empire State College]] of the [[State University of New York]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekerikgroup.com/about-us.html|title=About Us|website=THE KERIK GROUP LLC|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Military===
From 1974 to 1977, Kerik served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Military Police Corps (United States)|Military Police Corps]]. He was [[United States Forces Korea|stationed in Korea]] as a [[military police]] sentry dog handler and to the [[XVIII Airborne Corps]] at [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]] in [[North Carolina]], assuming [[military police]] duties and teaching [[hand-to-hand combat]] to [[special operations]] and [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] personnel at the [[John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4065105.stm|title=Profile: Bernard Kerik|date=22 October 2009|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private sector===
Kerik was [[Military discharge|honorably discharged]] from the army in July 1977 and worked briefly for the Interstate Revenue Research Center, [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], as an investigator before joining the [[Washington Group International|Morrison Knudsen]] Saudi Arabia Consortium (MKSAC) in April 1978, where he was employed as a security officer at the [[King Khalid Military City]] in [[Hafar Al-Batin]], [[Saudi Arabia]], for nearly two-and-a-half years. Upon his return, he worked for the [[Cumberland County, North Carolina|Cumberland County]], [[North Carolina]] sheriff's office, in the patrol division and later for the City–County Bureau of Narcotics.

===Law enforcement===

From December 1981 to October 1982 and then July 1984 to July 1986, Kerik worked at the [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic County]] sheriff's office, in [[New Jersey]]. He served as the department's training officer and commander of the special weapons and operations, and ultimately chief and warden of the Passaic County jail.

Kerik worked from 1982 to 1984 as chief of investigations for the security division of the [[King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre|King Faisal Specialist Hospital]] in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. Six members of the hospital security staff, including Kerik, were fired and deported after an investigation in 1984 by the Saudi secret police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A45175-2004Dec7 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |title=Kerik's Surveillance Activity in Saudi Arabia Is Disputed |first1=John |last1=Mintz |first2=Lucy |last2=Shackelford |date=December 8, 2004 |accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1986, Kerik joined the [[New York City Police Department]] and was assigned to uniformed and plain-clothes duty in the 14th Precinct in Brooklyn and in the Midtown South patrol sector (Times Square). He was later transferred to the narcotics division as an [[Undercover operation|undercover]] in [[Harlem]], [[East Harlem|Spanish Harlem]], and [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] and was promoted to detective in September 1990. In 1991 he was assigned to the [[United States Department of Justice]], New York Drug Enforcement Task Force, Group T-43 until he was transferred to the Intelligence Division in February 1994, where he worked on the protective detail for then-mayor [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph W. Giuliani]].

In May 1994, Kerik was appointed to the [[New York City Department of Correction]] as the director of the Investigations Division and was later transferred to the commissioner's office as executive assistant to the commissioner, and in January 1995 he was appointed by Mayor Giuliani as the first deputy commissioner of the department.

In January 1998, Kerik became commissioner of the New York City Department of Correction. As corrections commissioner, he was responsible for an annual budget of $835 million, a civilian and uniformed workforce of 13,000, and 133,000 annual inmate admissions in the department's 16 jails, 15 court detention pens, and four hospital prison wards, including [[Rikers Island]].

He was credited with the creation of the Total Efficiency Accountability Management System (TEAMS), a management analysis and accountability program that placed as a finalist for the [[Harvard University]]'s [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] Award, for Innovations in American Government for year 2000. Through TEAMS, the department witnessed historic performance gains in virtually all areas of jail operations as a result of many new initiatives in violence reduction, overtime reduction, modernization of security equipment, an absence rate analysis program, and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-journal.org/html/9_2_why_the_jails.html Why the Jails Didn't Explode] by Frank Straub, Paul E.

During his tenure, the department developed a [[Gang intelligence unit]] and gang tracking database, networking with local, state, and federal authorities across the country. Inmate violence—defined as inmate-on-inmate stabbing and slashing incidents—were reduced by 93 percent from FY 1995 to FY 1999. Similarly, overtime spending in FY 1999 decreased 45 percent from FY 1995 and the uniform sick rate dropped for the same period by 25 percent. These achievements occurred during a period when the inmate population rose to record levels, from 110,410 admissions in FY 1994 to 133,000 in FY 1999, a 25 percent increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/jails_chief_inmates_working_miracles_s2zuVbIqP0W2EO429MnbZM |work=New York Post |title=Jails Chief Is Working Miracles: Morale Rising Among Guards And Inmates |first=Al |last=Guart |date=May 7, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1997, he was also appointed by the mayor to the New York City [[Gaming control board|Gambling Control Commission]].

Giuliani appointed Kerik the 40th [[New York City Police Commissioner|Police Commissioner of New York City]] on August 21, 2000.

Giuliani gave much of the credit for a drop in 2001 crime to Kerik, saying that "Commissioner Kerik took over a police department that was leading the country in crime declines, and somehow he was able to figure out how to create even more crime reduction and to do that against a national trend in which crime is going up in much of the rest of the country." Known in the department as the "beat-cop commissioner," Kerik frequently cruised the city at night with a security detail composed of cops who had been in shootouts, dangled from rooftops, hit by bullets, raced into burning buildings, and seen their partners die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Al |last=Guart |title=Heroes of Kerik's Police Posse |newspaper=New York Post |date=March 5, 2001 |url=http://www.thekerikgroup.com/uploads/2/3/6/2/23625642/ny_post_-_heroes_of__keriks_police_posse.pdf |type=pdf, The Kerik Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as police commissioner he made five arrests, including one involving two ex-convicts—one a paroled killer, wanted for a carjacking at gunpoint in Virginia—for allegedly driving a stolen van in [[Harlem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/26/nyregion/for-kerik-there-s-one-way-to-run-the-police-at-a-sprint.html?scp=7&amp;sq=kerik&amp;st=nyt |work=The New York Times |title=For Kerik, There's One Way To Run the Police, at a Sprint |first=Kevin |last=Flynn |date=March 26, 2001 |accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As police commissioner, Kerik served on the terrorism committee with the [[International Association of Chiefs of Police]] and the Criminal Justice Advisory Board for [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]].

Kerik was serving as police commissioner during the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Post-9/11 report recommends police, fire response changes |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002-08-19-nypd-nyfd-report_x.htm |date=August 19, 2002 |agency=Associated Press |work=USA Today |accessdate=May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was in his office when [[American Airlines Flight 11]] hit the North Tower. He arrived at the base of the North Tower three minutes before [[United Airlines Flight 175]] hit the South Tower, showering him and his staff with debris as Giuliani, Kerik, and their top aides were trapped inside a building at 75 Barclay Street.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thekerikgroup.com/uploads/2/3/6/2/23625642/giuliani_and_kerik_dodge_death.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Kerik served 16 months as commissioner, leaving office at the end of Giuliani's term on December 31, 2001.

===Return to private sector===
Following his departure from the [[New York City Police Department]], he was employed by [[Giuliani Partners]], a consulting firm formed by the former [[Mayor of New York City|mayor of New York]], [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]]. He served as a senior vice president at Giuliani Partners and as [[chief executive officer]] of Giuliani–Kerik LLC, an affiliate of Giuliani Partners. Kerik resigned from these positions in December 2004. In March 2005 he created The Kerik Group LLC, where he served as chairman until June 2009, consulting in crisis management and risk mitigation, counterterrorism and law enforcement, and jail/prison management strategies. He has served as an adviser and consultant to His Majesty [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah II]] of the [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] and to President Bharrat Jagdeo of the Republic of Guyana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000056/005609.htm Caribbean Net News: Kerik finally gets Guyana contract] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622064358/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000056/005609.htm |date=June 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestlifeonline.com/cms/publish/wealth/Bernie_Kerik_Wont_Fold.php www.rodale.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103175205/http://www.bestlifeonline.com/cms/publish/wealth/Bernie_Kerik_Wont_Fold.php |date=January 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has overseen threat and vulnerability assessments for a ruling family in the [[United Arab Emirates]] and has also worked on crime reduction and national security strategies in [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000049/004976.htm Caribbean Net News: US crime fighter visits Trinidad for talks with local officials] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830075759/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000049/004976.htm |date=2008-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekerikgroup.com|title=THE KERIK GROUP LLC|website=THE KERIK GROUP LLC|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interim Minister of Interior of Iraq===
In May 2003, during [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]], Kerik was appointed by the [[George W. Bush]] administration as interim Interior Minister of [[Iraq]] and senior policy adviser to U.S. presidential envoy to Iraq, [[Paul Bremer]]. When Kerik arrived in Iraq the Ministry of Interior did not exist, having collapsed and dissolved during the U.S.–led coalition's invasion of Iraq. Kerik was responsible for restructuring and rebuilding the ministry and all its constituent parts: the national police, intelligence service, and border and customs police, as well as choosing the officials who would take control of these institutions when he left. Prior to Kerik's departure from Iraq on September 2, 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/kerik_close_call_ex_city_top_cop_MyT1W1vMZ4rw2rocTkaHeJ |work=New York Post |title=Kerik Close Call: Ex-City Top Cop Dodges Baghdad Bomb |first=Al |last=Guart |date=September 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than 35,000 Iraqi police were reinstated, 35 police stations were stood up in Baghdad with several more around the country, the senior deputy interior ministers were appointed, and the newly established governing council appointed the first Iraqi minister of interior, post–Saddam Hussein, [[Nuri Badran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/guiding_iraq_effort_road_to_recovery_IEzqJQvXQ569z1xrDQVDbM/2 |work=New York Post |title=Guiding Iraq On A Road To Recovery: Experts &amp; Officials Grade Postwar Effort |first=Niles |last=Lathem |date=August 3, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014012635/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/guiding_iraq_effort_road_to_recovery_IEzqJQvXQ569z1xrDQVDbM/2 |archivedate=October 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[United Nations]] UNODC fact-finding mission report dated May 18, 2003 at the beginning of his term, noted that Kerik's team made "positive interventions in a number of areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/30/world/after-war-law-enforcement-us-struggles-transform-tainted-iraqi-police-force.html?pagewanted=1 |work=The New York Times |title=AFTER THE WAR: LAW ENFORCEMENT; U.S. Struggles to Transform A Tainted Iraqi Police Force |first=Amy |last=Waldman |date=June 30, 2003 |accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure as Interior Minister of Iraq Bernard Kerik secretly accepted and failed to report a $250,000 interest free "loan" from Israeli billionaire Eitan Wertheimer, a gift later determined to be a bribe for which he was indicted by the US federal government and sentenced to prison. Precisely what Wertheimer expected to receive in return for the money is an open question.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kerik Loan Activity Is Brought to Light After Indictment|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/nyregion/24kerik.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, 2004, Kerik was nominated by President Bush to succeed [[Tom Ridge]] as [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security]]. [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]] vetted Kerik during that nomination period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0744 |title=No Skeletons in My Closet! |accessdate=2007-11-09 |work=Village Voice }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; But on December 10, after a week of press scrutiny, Kerik withdrew acceptance of the nomination. Kerik stated that he had unknowingly hired an undocumented worker as a nanny and housekeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Mike|title=On Kerik Nomination, White House Missed Red Flags|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A64738-2004Dec14?language=printer|newspaper=Washington Post|date=December 15, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041216004432/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6716363/|archivedate=December 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar violations of [[immigration law]] had previously caused the withdrawal of the nominations of [[Linda Chavez]] as [[United States Secretary of Labor|secretary of labor]] by [[George W. Bush]] and of [[Zoë Baird]] and [[Kimba Wood]] for [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]].

Shortly after withdrawing his name from consideration, Kerik became the target of a New York State grand jury investigation by the Bronx District Attorney's Office, and later, the United States Attorney's Office.

==State and federal investigation, federal indictment, and conviction==
After an 18-month-long [[grand jury]] investigation conducted by [[the Bronx]] District Attorney's Office, Kerik pleaded guilty in Bronx Supreme Court on June 30, 2006 to two ethics violations (unclassified misdemeanors). Kerik acknowledged that during the time he was Interior Minister of Iraq, he accepted a $250,000 interest-free "loan" from Israeli billionaire Eitan Wertheimer and failed to report it. Kerik first met the billionaire, whose vast holdings include major defense contractors, when Kerik took a four-day trip to Israel less than two weeks before September 11, 2001 to discuss counter-terrorism with Israeli officials.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Billionaire Businessman Gave Kerik $250K "Loan"|publisher=Talking Points Memo|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/img-src-http-talkingpointsmemo-com-images-bush-kerik-lawn-muck-jpg-vspace-5-hspace-5-align-left-billionaire-businessman-gave-kerik-250k-loan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2007, Kerik was indicted by a federal [[grand jury]] in [[White Plains, New York]] on charges of [[tax fraud]], and [[making false statements]] to the federal government about the $250,000 he received from Wertheimer. Prosecutors further accused Kerik of receiving about $236,000 from New York real estate mogul Steven C. Witkoff between 2001 and 2003.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Some of the New York charges were dropped in December 2008, but Kerik was then re-indicted on the same charges in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/05/27/new.york.kerik.indicted/index.html|title=Former NYPD commissioner Kerik indicted |accessdate=2009-05-27 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 2009, Kerik pleaded guilty to eight felony tax and false statement charges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/06/nyregion/06kerik.html|title=Kerik Confesses to Cheating I.R.S. and Telling Lies}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sentenced to forty-eight months in federal prison and three years' supervised release ([[probation]]).

'''Carnival''' (see [[#Etymology|other spellings and names]]) is a [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] and [[Greek Orthodox]] festive [[season]] that occurs before the [[liturgy|liturgical]] season of [[Lent]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Carnival}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main events typically occur during February or early March, during the period historically known as [[Shrovetide]] (or Pre-Lent). Carnival typically involves public [[party|celebrations]], including events such as [[parade]]s, public [[street party|street parties]] and other entertainments, combining some elements of a [[circus]]. Elaborate costumes and masks allow people to set aside their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity.&lt;ref name=Bakhtin&gt;Bakhtin, Mikhail. 1984. ''Rabelais and his world''. Translated by H. Iswolsky. Bloomington: [[Indiana University Press]]. Original edition, ''Tvorchestvo Fransua Rable i narodnaia kul'tura srednevekov'ia i Renessansa'', 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants often indulge in excessive consumption of alcohol,&lt;ref name="BarrowsRoom1991"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barrows |first1=Susanna |last2=Room |first2=Robin |title=Drinking: Behavior and Belief in Modern History| url={{google books| id=o-wmSdtGer0C| page=404| plainurl=y}} |accessdate=17 February 2015 |year=1991 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520070851 |pages=404–}}&lt;/ref&gt; meat, and other foods that will be forgone during upcoming Lent. 

Other common features of carnival include mock battles such as food fights; expressions of social [[satire]]; mockery of authorities; costumes of the [[grotesque body]] that display exaggerated features such as large noses, bellies, mouths, [[phalli]], or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms.&lt;ref name=Bakhtin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Mauldin| first1=Barbara| title=¡Carnaval!| date=2004| publisher=[[University of Washington Press]] | location=Seattle| page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Carnival'' is traditionally used in areas with a large [[Catholic]] presence, as well as in [[Greece]]. The [[Philippines]], a predominantly [[Roman Catholic]] country in Asia, also celebrates Carnival (or [[Mardi Gras]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philstar.com/cebu-lifestyle/555453/pre-lenten-festivals-all-over-world |title=Pre-lenten festivals all over the world |work=philstar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In historically [[Lutheran|Evangelical Lutheran]] countries, the celebration is known as [[Fastelavn]],&lt;ref name="Ruprecht2010"&gt;{{cite book| last=Ruprecht| first=Tony| title=Toronto's Many Faces| date=14 December 2010| publisher=Dundurn| isbn=9781459718043| page=115| quote=Fastelavn, held the week before Lent, is the Danish [[Mardi Gras]]. This even takes place at the Danish Lutheran Church and at Sunset Villa. }}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.danishchurchsocal.com/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |year=2014 |publisher=The Danish Lutheran Church &amp; Cultural Center |accessdate=17 February 2015 |quote=We celebrate Danish traditions during our church year such as Fastelavn at lent (a Carnival for the kids at the beginning of the Lenten season), a Harvest Service in Fall and preparing for Advent and Christmas with a Klippe-Klistre (Cut &amp; Paste Decorations) in late November.

On [[Ash Wednesday]], the morning after Mardi Gras, repentant Christians return to church to receive upon the forehead the sign of the cross in ashes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Slavic [[Eastern Orthodox]] nations, [[Maslenitsa]] is celebrated during the last week before [[Great Lent]]. In [[German language|German]]-speaking [[Europe]] and the [[Netherlands]], the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11&amp;nbsp;a.m.). This dates back to celebrations before the [[Advent]] season or with harvest celebrations of [[St. Martin's Day]].&lt;!--{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}--&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Latin]]-derived name of the holiday is sometimes also spelled ''Carnaval'', typically in areas where [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are spoken, or ''Carnevale'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]-speaking contexts. Alternative names are used for regional and local celebrations.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The word is said to come from the [[Late Latin]] expression ''carne levare'', which means "remove meat"; a [[folk etymology]] derives it from ''carne vale'', "farewell to meat". In either case, this signifies the approaching fast.&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Carnival |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''carne'' may also be translated as flesh, producing "a farewell to the flesh", a phrase embraced by certain carnival celebrants to embolden the festival's carefree spirit.&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary" /&gt; The etymology of the word ''Carnival'' thus points to a [[Christian]] origin of the celebratory period.&lt;ref name="Rudwin1920"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudwin|first=Maximilian Josef|title=The Origin of the German Carnival Comedy|accessdate=24 May 2018|year=1920|publisher=G. E. Stechert &amp; Company|language=English|page=2|quote=The English name for Carnival, it may be argued, points to a Christian origin of this festival.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars argue that the origin is the festival of the ''[[Navigium Isidis]]'' ("ship of Isis"), where the image of [[Isis]] was carried to the seashore to bless the start of sailing season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.Carnival.com/isis/rising/ |title=Isis Rising |publisher=Carnival.com |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival consisted of a parade of masks following an adorned wooden boat, called in Latin ''carrus navalis'', possibly the source of both the name and the [[float (parade)|parade floats]].

==History==

===Origin===
[[File:Carnival at Acireale.JPG|thumb|260px|The traditional carnival of [[Acireale]], [[Sicily]]]]
The word ''Carnival'' is of Christian origin,&lt;ref name="Rudwin1920"/&gt; and in the Middle Ages, it referred to a period following [[Christmastide]] that reached its climax before midnight on [[Shrove Tuesday]].&lt;ref name="Ruff2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruff|first=Julius R.|title=Violence in Early Modern Europe 1500-1800|date=4 October 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English|isbn=9780521598941|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[Lent]] was a period of [[fasting]], "Carnival therefore represented a last period of feasting and celebration before the spiritual rigors of Lent."&lt;ref name="Ruff2001"/&gt; Meat was plentiful during this part of the [[liturgical year|Christian calendar]] and it was consumed during Carnival as people abstained from meat consumption during the following liturgical season, Lent.&lt;ref name="Ruff2001"/&gt; In the last few days of Carnival, known as [[Shrovetide]], people confessed (shrived) their sins in preparation for Lent as well. In 1605, a Shrovetide play spoke of Christians who painted their faces to celebrate the season:&lt;ref name="Katritzky2012"/&gt; 
{{poemquote|
What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum
And the vile squealing of the wry-nck'd fife,
Clamber not you up o the casements then,
Nor thrust your head into the public street
To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces.&lt;ref name="Katritzky2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katritzky|first=M.A. |title=Healing, Performance and Ceremony in the Writings of Three Early Modern Physicians: Hippolytus Guarinonius and the Brothers Felix and Thomas Platter|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|language=Englis|isbn=9780754667070|pages=47–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

From an [[anthropological]] point of view, carnival is a reversal ritual, in which social roles are reversed and norms about desired behavior are suspended.&lt;ref name="meertens.knaw.nl"&gt;[http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/meertensnet/wdb.php?sel=79966 "Carnaval"]. Meertens.knaw.nl. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John F. "Roman Festivals," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winter was thought of as the reign of the winter spirits; these needed to be driven out in order for the summer to return. Carnival can thus be regarded as a rite of passage from darkness to light, from winter to summer: a fertility celebration, the first spring festival of the new year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jansimons.nl/bronnenmagazijn/bestandenbronnenmagazijn/selectieartikelen/alaaf.htm "Vitaberna"]. Jansimons.nl. Retrieved on 13 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, a Carnival feast was the last opportunity for common people to eat well, as there was typically a food shortage at the end of the winter as stores ran out. Until spring produce was available, people were limited to the minimum necessary meals during this period. On what nowadays is called ''vastenavond'' (the days before [[fasting]]), all the remaining winter stores of lard, butter, and meat which were left would be eaten, for these would otherwise soon start to rot and decay. The selected livestock had already been slaughtered in November and the meat would be no longer preservable. All the food that had survived the winter had to be eaten to assure that everyone was fed enough to survive until the coming spring would provide new food sources.&lt;ref name="fenvlaanderen.be"&gt;[http://www.fenvlaanderen.be/carnaval/wat-carnaval "Wat is carnaval?" | Fen Vlaanderen]. Fenvlaanderen.be. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the feast also was a time to indulge [[sexual desire]]s, which were supposed to be suppressed during the following period fasting.&lt;ref name="fenvlaanderen.be"/&gt;&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.isgeschiedenis.nl/nieuws/oorsprong_van_het_carnaval/ |title=Oorsprong van het Carnaval in de geschiedenis van Nederland IsGeschiedenis |publisher=Isgeschiedenis.nl |date=11 November 2011 |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Lent began, all rich food and drink were consumed in what became a giant celebration that involved the whole community, and is thought to be the origin of Carnival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2001-11-30|title=Carnival|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/CX2507300021/GVRL?u=txshracd2597&amp;sid=GVRL&amp;xid=131fbf85|journal=Encyclopedia of Easter, Carnival, and Lent|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Christian sermons and texts, the example of a vessel is used to explain Christian doctrine: "the nave of the church of baptism", "the ship of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]", etc. The writings show that processions with ship-like carts were held and lavish feasts were celebrated on the eve of Lent or the greeting of spring in the early Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="fenvlaanderen.be"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ziggo1"/&gt;

The Lenten period of the [[liturgical calendar]], the six weeks directly before [[Easter]], was historically marked by fasting, study, and other pious or penitential practices. During Lent, no parties or celebrations were held, and people refrained from eating rich foods, such as meat, dairy, fat, and sugar. The first three classes were often totally unavailable during this period because of late winter shortages.&lt;ref&gt;Gaignebet, Claude. 1984. ''El Carnaval: Ensayos de mitologia popular''. Barcelona: Editorial Alta Fulla. Original edition: ''Le carnaval. Essais de mythologie populaire'', Editions Payot, Paris, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Christian festivals such as [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] were Church-sanctioned celebrations, Carnival was also a manifestation of European [[folk culture]]. In the Christian tradition, the fasting is to commemorate the [[temptation of Christ|40 days that Jesus fasted in the desert]], according to the [[New Testament]], and also to reflect on Christian values. It was a time for [[catechumen]]s (those [[conversion to Christianity|converting to Christianity]]) to prepare for [[baptism]] at Easter. 

Carnival in the Middle Ages took not just a few days, but almost the entire period between Christmas and the beginning of Lent. In those two months, Christian populations used their several holidays as an outlet for their daily frustrations.&lt;ref name="Isgeschiedenis.nl"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.isgeschiedenis.nl/nieuws/sociale_functie_van_carnaval_in_de_middeleeuwen/ |title=Geschiedenis van carnaval in de middeleeuwen IsGeschiedenis |publisher=Isgeschiedenis.nl |date= |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many synods and councils attempted to set things "right". [[Caesarius of Arles]] (470–542) protested around 500 [[common era|CE]] in his sermons against the pagan practices. Centuries later, his statements were adapted as the building blocks of the ''[[Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum]]'' ("small index of superstitious and pagan practices"), which was drafted by the Synod of Leptines in 742. It condemned the ''Spurcalibus en februario''.&lt;ref name="fenvlaanderen.be"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ziggo1"/&gt;

Pope [[Gregory the Great]] (590–604) decided that fasting would start on Ash Wednesday. The whole Carnival event was set before the fasting, to set a clear division between celebrations and penitence.&lt;ref name="Halmo1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Halmo|first=Joan|title=Celebrating the Church Year with Young Children|year=1989|publisher=Liturgical Press|language=English|isbn=9780814615805|page=79|quote=Carnival is a time of revelry and excess before the dying of Lent, a time of feasting before the fasting.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also dispatched missionaries to sanctify any excesses in popular Carnival customs.&lt;ref name="Davidson2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Alan|title=The Oxford Companion to Food|date=21 August 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780191040726|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the custom during Carnival that the ruling class would be playfully mocked using [[mask]]s and [[disguise]]s.&lt;ref name="fenvlaanderen.be"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ziggo1"/&gt;

In the year 743, the [[synod]] in Leptines (Leptines is located near [[Binche]] in Belgium) spoke out furiously against the excesses in the month of February.&lt;ref name="ziggo1"/&gt; Also from the same period dates the phrase: "Whoever in February by a variety of less honorable acts tries to drive out winter is not a Christian, but a pagan." Confession books from around 800 contain more information about how people would dress as an animal or old woman during the festivities in January and February, even though this was a sin with no small penance.&lt;ref name="fenvlaanderen.be"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ziggo1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://middencommiteit.be/mc/?page_id=800 Oorsprong Carnaval: Middencommiteit Lommel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225054839/http://middencommiteit.be/mc/?page_id=800 |date=25 February 2016 }}.

===Development===
In the Middle Ages, "Carnival and Lent were both necessary, inevitable episodes in the eternal cycle of the Church year."&lt;ref name="Bowen2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=Barbara C.|title=Humour and Humanism in the Renaissance|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate|language=English|isbn=9780860789543|page=507|quote=To the Middle Ages Carnival and Lent were both necessary, inevitable episodes in the eternal cycle of the Church year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While forming an integral part of the Christian calendar, particularly in Catholic regions, many Carnival traditions resemble those antedating Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cantao.net/index_arquivos/Carnaval.htm| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090129101601/http://cantao.net/index_arquivos/Carnaval.htm| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2009-01-29| title = O que é o Carnaval?| date = | website = Cantao.net| publisher = | last = | first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[medieval pageant|medieval pageants]] and festivals such as [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] were church-sanctioned, Carnival was also a manifestation of medieval [[folk culture]]. Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals, such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the [[Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht]]. However, evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive, and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks, and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the [[resurrection of Jesus]], followed by a liminal period, and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, and a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the [[lunar calendar]]. Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures who make a gift to the people with their deaths. In the case of Jesus, the gift is [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] in [[heaven]], and in the case of King Carnival, the acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Brad. 2008. ''Sensory Politics: Catalan Ritual and the New Immigration''. [[University of California at Berkeley]].&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[Anti-Judaism#Christian anti-Judaism|Christian anti-Judaism]], the commonalities between church and Carnival rituals and imagery suggest a common root. [[Passion of Jesus|Christ's passion]] is itself grotesque: since [[Anti-Judaism in early Christianity|early Christianity]], Christ is figured as the victim of [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|summary judgment]], and is tortured and executed by Romans before a [[Jewish deicide|Jewish mob]] ("His blood is on us and on our children!" {{bibleref2|Matthew|27:24–25|NIV}}). [[Holy Week]] processions in Spain include crowds who vociferously insult the figure of Jesus. Irreverence, parody, degradation, and laughter at a tragicomic [[effigy]] of God can be seen as intensifications of the sacred order.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado Ruiz, Manuel. 2001. "Luces iconoclastas: Anticlericalism, espacio, y ritual en la España contemporánia", ''Ariel Antropología''. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1466, the Catholic Church under [[Pope Paul II]] revived customs of the Saturnalia carnival: Jews were forced to race naked through the streets of the city of Rome. "Before they were to run, the Jews were richly fed, so as to make the race more difficult for them and at the same time more amusing for spectators. They ran… amid Rome's taunting shrieks and peals of laughter, while the [[Pope|Holy Father]] stood upon a richly ornamented balcony and laughed heartily," an eyewitness reports.&lt;ref name="DIKertzer"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Kertzer| first1=David I.| title=The Popes Against the Jews: The Vatican's Role in the Rise of Modern Anti-Semitism| date=2001| publisher=Alfred A.

Some of the best-known traditions, including carnal [[parade]]s and [[masquerade ball]]s, were first recorded in [[medieval Italy]]. The [[Carnival of Venice]] was, for a long time, the most famous carnival (although [[Napoleon]] abolished it in 1797 and only in 1979 was the tradition restored). From Italy, Carnival traditions spread to Spain, Portugal, and France, and from France to [[New France]] in North America. From Spain and Portugal, it spread with colonization to the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]]. In the early 19th century in the German [[Rhineland]] and [[Southern Netherlands]], the weakened medieval tradition also revived. Continuously in the 18th and 19th centuries CE, as part of the annual Saturnalia abuse of the carnival in Rome, [[rabbi]]s of the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|ghetto]] were forced to march through the city streets wearing foolish guise, jeered upon and pelted by a variety of missiles from the crowd. A petition of the Jewish community of Rome sent in 1836 to [[Pope Gregory XVI]] to stop the annual anti-semitic Saturnalia abuse got a negation: "It is not opportune to make any innovation."&lt;ref name="DIKertzer"/&gt;{{rp|33,74–75}}

In the Rhineland in 1823, the first modern Carnival parade took place in [[Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.koelner-karneval.info/Dreigestirn/Dreigestirn.htm| title=Das Kölner Dreigestirn| work=koelner-karneval.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper Rhineland is mostly [[Reformed]], as is most of Northern Germany and [[Northern Europe]]. Carnaval (''[[Fasching]]'' or ''Fastnacht'' in Germany) mixed pagan traditions with Christian traditions. Pre-Lenten celebrations featured parades, costumes and masks to endure Lent's withdrawal from worldly pleasures.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[File:Théodore Géricault - Riderless Racers at Rome - Walters 37189.jpg|thumb|''Riderless Racers at Rome'' by [[Théodore Géricault]]. From the mid-15th century until 1882, spring carnival in Rome closed with a [[horse race]]. Fifteen to 20 riderless horses, originally imported from the [[Barbary Coast]] of North Africa, ran the length of the [[Via del Corso]], a long, straight city street, in about 2½ minutes.]]

Other areas developed their own traditions. In the United Kingdom, [[West Indian]] immigrants brought with them the traditions of [[Caribbean Carnival]]; however, the Carnivals now celebrated at [[Notting Hill Carnival|Notting Hill]], [[Leeds West Indian Carnival|Leeds]], Yorkshire, and other places became divorced from their religious origin and became [[secular]] events that take place in the summer months.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Geographic distribution==

===Africa===

====Cape Verde Islands====

Carnival was introduced by Portuguese settlers. The celebration is celebrated on each of the archipelago's nine inhabited islands. In [[Mindelo]], [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|São Vicente]], groups challenge each other for a yearly prize. It has imported various Brazilian Carnival traditions. The celebration in [[São Nicolau, Cape Verde|São Nicolau]] is more traditional, where established groups parade through the [[Ribeira Brava, Cape Verde|Ribeira Brava]], gathering in the [[town square]], although it has adopted drums, floats and costumes from Brazil. In São Nicolau, three groups, Copa Cabana, Estrela Azul, and Brilho Da Zona, construct a painted float using fire, newspaper for the mold, and iron and steel for structure. Carnival São Nicolau is celebrated over three days: dawn Saturday, Sunday afternoon, and Tuesday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caboverdeonline.com/news/68-the-carnival-of-sao-nicolau-a-procession-rich-in-history|title=CaboVerdeOnline.com - The Carnival of São Nicolau - a procession rich in history|last=User|first=Super|website=www.caboverdeonline.com|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrations are captured in the award-winning feature documentary [[Tchindas]], nominated at the [[12th Africa Movie Academy Awards]].

====Seychelles====

The [[Seychelles]] carnival began in 2011. It is held in the capital city of [[Victoria, Seychelles|Victoria]] and takes place over three days. On Day 1, the grand opening is held in the city center near the clock tower. The second day is parade day. On Day 3, the closing ceremony is held, and a lottery winner is announced.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Zimbabwe====

The [[Harare]] Carnival is held late in May. Events include fashion and music shows. The climax is a street party featuring costumes and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201405230663.html| title=Zimbabwe: Biggest Street Party Comes to Harare| work=allAfrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===

====Antigua====
{{Main article|Antigua Carnival}}
The [[Antigua]]n Carnival is held from the end of July to the first Tuesday in August. The most important day is that of the ''j'ouvert'' (or ''juvé''), in which brass and steel drum bands perform. [[Barbuda]]'s Carnival, held in June, is known as "Caribana". The Antiguan and Barbudan Carnivals replaced the Old Time Christmas Festival in 1957, with hopes of inspiring tourism.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Argentina====
In [[Argentina]], the most representative Carnival performed is the so-called [[Murga]], although other famous Carnivals, more like Brazil's, are held in Argentine [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|Mesopotamia]] and the North-East. [[Gualeguaychú, Entre Ríos|Gualeguaychú]] in the east of [[Entre Ríos Province]] is the most important Carnival city and has one of the largest parades. It adopts a musical background similar to Brazilian or Uruguayan Carnival. [[Corrientes]] is another city with a Carnival tradition. [[Chamamé]] is a popular musical style. In all major cities and many towns throughout the country, Carnival is celebrated.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As Carnival coincides with summer in the Southern Hemisphere, in many parts of Argentina children play with water. The 19th century tradition of filling empty egg shells with water has evolved into water games that include the throwing of [[water balloon]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Aruba====
Carnival in [[Aruba]] means weeks of events that bring colourfully decorated floats, contagiously throbbing music, luxuriously costumed groups of celebrants of all ages, King and Queen elections, electrifying jump-ups and torchlight parades, the Jouvert morning: the Children's Parades, and finally the Grand Parade. Aruba's biggest celebration is a month-long affair consisting of festive "jump-ups" (street parades), spectacular parades, and creative contests. Music and flamboyant costumes play a central role, from the Queen elections to the Grand Parade. Street parades continue in various districts throughout the month, with brass band, [[steel drum]] and [[roadmarch]] tunes. On the evening before Lent, Carnival ends with the symbolic burning of King Momo.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Bahamas====
Junkanoo is the principal street parade in the Bahamas, it has been practiced in the Bahamas before and after the 1834 emancipation of slavery in the British Empire.

In an effort to capitalize on Carnival's popularity, the [[Bahamas]] announced the first Bahamas [[Junkanoo]] Carnival to commence in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bahamas.co.uk/about/junkanoo/bahamas-junkanoo-carnival |title=Bahamas Junkanoo Carnival |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421181151/http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/reviews/2004/dichotomyb.html |archivedate=21 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barbados====
{{Main article|Crop over}}
Carnival is known as "Crop Over" and is [[Barbados]]'s biggest festival. Its early beginnings were on the [[sugar cane]] [[plantation]]s during the colonial period. Crop Over began in 1688, and featured singing, dancing, and accompaniment by [[shak-shak]], [[banjo]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[fiddle]], guitar, bottles filled with water, and bones. Other traditions included climbing a greased pole, feasting, and drinking competitions. Originally signaling the end of the yearly cane harvest, it evolved into a national festival. In the late 20th century, Crop Over began to closely mirror the Trinidad Carnival. Beginning in June, Crop Over runs until the first Monday in August when it culminates in the finale, the Grand Kadooment.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Carnival time for many islanders is one big party. Craft markets, food tents/stalls, street parties, and cavalcades fill every week.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

A major feature is the [[calypso music|calypso]] competition. Calypso music, originating in Trinidad, uses syncopated rhythm and topical lyrics. It offers a medium in which to satirise local politics, amidst the general bacchanal. Calypso tents, also originating in Trinidad, feature cadres of musicians who perform biting social commentaries, political exposés or rousing exhortations to "wuk dah waistline" and "roll dat bumper". The groups compete for the Calypso Monarch Award, while the air is redolent with the smells of [[Barbadian cuisine|Bajan]] cooking during the [[Bridgetown]] Market Street Fair. The Cohobblopot Festival blends dance, drama, and music with the crowning of the King and Queen of costume bands. Every evening the "Pic-o-de-Crop" Show is performed after the King of Calypso is finally crowned. The climax of the festival is Kadooment Day, celebrated with a national holiday, when costume bands fill the streets with pulsating Barbadian rhythms and fireworks.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Belize====

[[San Pedro Town|San Pedro]] is one of [[Belize]]'s few cities to observe Carnaval before Lent. Elsewhere, Carnaval (sometimes referred to as Carnival) often occurs in September. The Fiesta de Carnaval is often the most popular celebration, usually held over three days prior to Ash Wednesday, but the festivities often extend to the full week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://belizeanminds.blogspot.ca/2013/09/history-of-carnivals-in-belize-review.html| title=Belizean Minds| work=belizeanminds.blogspot.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; This festival "always includes music, dancing, costumes and parades."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Brown, J.; Vorhees, M. (2013). ''Belize''. [[Lonely Planet]] Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Comparsa]]s are held throughout the week, consisting of large groups "of dancers dancing and traveling on the streets, followed by a Carrosa (carriage) where the musicians play. The Comparsa is a development of African processions where groups of devotees follow a given saint or deity during a particular religious celebration."&lt;ref&gt;[[Comparsa]]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most popular comparsas of Fiesta de Carnaval is the male group comparsa, usually composed of notable men from the community who dress up in outlandish costumes or cross-dress and dance to compete for money and prizes.&lt;ref name="goambergriscaye.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.goambergriscaye.com/fest.html| title=Ambergris Caye, Belize, Festivals| work=goambergriscaye.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular activities include body painting and flour fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/belize/the-northern-cayes/ambergris-caye-and-san-pedro/events/local-festivals-culture/fiesta-de-carnaval| title=Fiesta de Carnaval| work=Lonely Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="joseluiszapata.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.joseluiszapata.com/2012/02/carnaval-de-san-pedro-belize/ |title=Carnaval de San Pedro, Belize |work=joseluiszapata.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402145420/http://www.joseluiszapata.com/2012/02/carnaval-de-san-pedro-belize/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; "On the last day of Carnival painters flood the street to paint each other. This simply means that a mixture of water paint and water or raw eggs is used to paint people on the streets, the goal being to paint as many people as you can."&lt;ref name="goambergriscaye.com"/&gt;

Street fights often occur during the festivities - some locals treat this festival as an opportunity to exact revenge on their enemies. [[Vandalism]] is common and "businesses constantly have to prepare in covering or repainting their advertisements during Carnival season because of the mischief performed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ambergristoday.com/content/teen-talk/2012/february/29/carnival-messy-situation?page=1| title=Teen Talk - Is Carnival A Messy Situation?| work=ambergristoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition continues despite critics who advocate the termination of these festivities.&lt;ref name="joseluiszapata.com"/&gt;

The first true Carnival expression of this Brazilian festivity, officially recognized by Brazilian historians, took place in Rio de Janeiro, with the ''préstitos'', very similar to a musical processions, in 1641, when [[John IV of Portugal]] was crowned King and parties were celebrated in public streets.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=====Rio de Janeiro, State of Rio de Janeiro=====
{{Main article|Rio Carnival}}
The street carnival of [[Rio de Janeiro]] is designated by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the largest carnival in the world, with approximately two million people each day.&lt;ref name=guin&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tara-donaldson/5-reasons-trinidad-has-the-worlds-greatest-carnival_b_8705304.html 5 Reasons Trinidad Has the World’s Greatest Carnival], HuffPost, 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samba school]]s are large, social entities with thousands of members and a theme for their song and parade each year. In [[Rio Carnival]], samba schools parade in the [[Sambadrome]] (''sambódromo'' in Portuguese). Some of the most famous include [[GRES Estação Primeira de Mangueira]], [[GRES Portela]], [[GRES Imperatriz Leopoldinense]], [[GRES Beija-Flor de Nilópolis]], [[GRES Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel]], and recently, Unidos da Tijuca and [[GRES União da Ilha do Governador]]. Local tourists pay $500–950, depending on the costume, to buy a samba costume and dance in the parade. ''Blocos'' are small informal groups with a definite theme in their samba, usually satirizing the political situation. About 30 schools in Rio gather hundreds of thousands of participants. More than 440 ''blocos'' operate in Rio. ''Bandas'' are samba musical bands, also called "street carnival bands", usually formed within a single neighborhood or musical background. The Carnival industry chain amassed in 2012 almost US$1 billion in revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/rios-carnival-not-just-a-local-party-anymore-2012-02-13?pagenumber=1| title=Rio's Carnival: Not just a local party anymore| author=Sarah de Sainte Croix| work=MarketWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Recife, Pernambuco=====
{{Main article|Recife Carnival}}
[[Recife, Pernambuco|Recife]] is marked by the parade of the largest carnival block in the world, the [[Galo da Madrugada]]. This parade happens on the first Saturday of Carnival (Saturday of Zé Pereira), passes through the center of the city of Recife and has, as symbol, a giant cock that is positioned in the Duarte Coelho Bridge. In this block, there is a great variety of musical rhythms, but the most present is [[Frevo]] (characteristic rhythm of both Recife and [[Olinda]] that was declared Intangible Heritage of Humanity by Unesco).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=====Salvador, Bahia=====
{{Main article|Bahian Carnival}}
[[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] has large Carnival celebrations, including the [[Axé]], a typical Bahia music. A truck with giant speakers and a platform, where musicians play songs of local genres such as Axé, [[samba-reggae]], and [[Arrocha]], drives through town with a crowd following while dancing and singing. It was originally staged by two Salvador musicians, Dodo &amp; Osmar, in the 1950s. After the [[Salvador, Bahia#Carnival|Salvador Carnival]], [[Porto Seguro]] continues the celebration.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Three circuits make up the festival. Campo Grande is the longest and most traditional. Barra-Ondina is the most famous, on the seaside of Barra Beach and Ondina Beach and Pelourinho.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnaval.salvador.ba.gov.br/2013/capa/pagina.php?id=61 Carnaval.salvador.ba.gov.br] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606070943/http://www.carnaval.salvador.ba.gov.br/2013/capa/pagina.php?id=61 |date=6 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
[[Caribana]], held in [[Toronto]] on the first weekend of August, has its origins in Caribbean Carnival traditions. To take advantage of more comfortable weather, Caribana is held in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caribana.com/index.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20160621153706/http://www.caribana.com/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 June 2016 |title=The Online Guide to Toronto's Summer Carnival |publisher=Caribana.Com |date=15 August 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance at the parade typically exceeds one million.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The [[Quebec Winter Carnival]] is the biggest winter-themed Carnival in the world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} It depends on snowfall and very cold weather, to keep snowy [[skiing|ski]] trails in good condition and [[ice sculpture]]s frozen. The carnival is held during the last days of January and first days of February.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In the [[Ottawa]]-[[Gatineau]] region, [[Winterlude]] takes place during February.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Caribbean====
{{Main article|Carnival in the Caribbean}}
Most [[Caribbean]] islands celebrate Carnival. The largest and most well-known is in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. [[Antigua]], [[Aruba]], [[Barbados]], [[Bonaire]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Cuba]], [[Curaçao]], [[Dominica]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Grenada]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Guyana]], [[Haiti]], [[Jamaica]], [[Saba]], [[Sint Eustatius]] (Statia), [[Sint Maarten]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Kitts]], [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Saint Vincent (Antilles)|Saint Vincent]], and the [[Grenadines]] hold lengthy carnival seasons and large celebrations.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Carnival is an important cultural event in the [[Dutch Caribbean]]. Festivities include "jump-up" parades with beautifully colored costumes, floats, and live bands, as well as [[beauty contests]] and other competitions. Celebrations include a middle-of-the-night [[j'ouvert]] (''juvé'') parade that ends at sunrise with the burning of a straw [[King Momo]], cleansing sins and bad luck. On Statia, he is called Prince Stupid.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Carnival has been celebrated in Cuba since the 18th century. Participants don costumes from the island's cultural and ethnic variety. After [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Cuban Revolution|Communist Revolution]], Carnival's religious overtones were suppressed. The events remained, albeit frowned upon by the state. Carnival celebrations have been in decline throughout Cuba since then.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Colombia====
[[File:DIOSESANCESTRALES HUGOMONCAYO2007 4.jpg|thumb|260px|The [[Blacks and Whites' Carnival]] in [[Pasto]]]]
{{Main article|Carnival in Colombia}}
Carnival was introduced by the Spaniards and incorporated elements from [[European culture]]s. It has managed to reinterpret traditions that belonged to Colombia's African and [[Amerindian]] cultures. Documentary evidence shows that Carnival existed in Colombia in the 18th century and had already been a cause for concern for colonial authorities, who censored the celebrations, especially in the main political centres such as [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Bogotá]], and [[Popayán]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The Carnival continued its evolution in small/unimportant towns out of view of the rulers. The result was the uninterrupted celebration of Carnival festivals in [[Barranquilla]] (see [[Barranquilla's Carnival]]), now recognized as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. The Barranquilla Carnival includes several parades on Friday and Saturday nights beginning on 11 January and ending with a six-day non-stop festival, beginning the Wednesday prior to Ash Wednesday and ending Tuesday midnight. Other celebrations occur in villages along the lower [[Magdalena River]] in northern Colombia, and in [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]] and [[Nariño]] (see [[Blacks and Whites' Carnival]]) in the south of the country. In the early 20th century, attempts to introduce Carnival in Bogotá were rejected by the government. The [[Bogotá Carnival]] was renewed in the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Dominica====
[[File:Dominicaband2.jpg|alt=Band members performing on drums while in the street; one member is wearing a monkey mask and comic hat.|thumb|right|300px|A Dominican Carnival costume band]]

{{Main article|Chanté mas}}
Carnival in [[Dominica]] is held in the capital city of [[Roseau]], and takes elements of Carnival that can be seen in the neighbouring French islands of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]], as well as [[Trinidad]]. Notable events leading up to Carnival include the Opening of Carnival celebrations, the Calypso Monarch music competition, the Queen of Carnival Beauty Pageant, and [[bouyon music]] bands. Celebrations last for the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Dominican Republic====
{{Main article|Carnival in the Dominican Republic}}
[[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] Carnival is celebrated in most cities and towns in the main streets during February. Among its main characteristics are its flashy costumes and loud music. The one held in [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|La Vega]], which is one of the biggest in the country, and the national parade in [[Santo Domingo]] were where the first Carnival of the Americas was held.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Carvnival masks are elaborate and colorful. The costumes used on the parades are satires of the Devil and are called "Diablos Cojuelos". They dance, and run to the rhythm of [[merengue music]] mixed with techno, hip-hop, and [[reggaeton]]. Additional [[allegorical]] characters represent Dominican traditions such as "Roba la Gallina" and "Califé".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

One of the most international parades is in [[San Pedro de Macorís]]. It exhibits the "Guloyas" parade of costumed groups dancing in the streets. Revelers flee from the "Diablos Cojuelos" who try to hit them with "Vejigas".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The timing of the festivals has grown apart from its original religious synchronization with the period of Lent.  With National Independence Day on 27 February and the birthday of [[Juan Pablo Duarte]], its founding father, on 26 January, the Carnival celebrations fill February regardless of the [[Lenten calendar]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Ecuador====
[[File:Desfile de Carnaval en calles de Latacunga.jpg|thumb|Carnival parade in [[Latacunga]] city.]]
[[File:Comparsa latacungueña desfilando.jpg|thumb|Party in Latacunga city.]]
In [[Ecuador]], the celebrations began before the arrival of Catholicism. The Huarangas Indians (from the Chimbos nation) used to celebrate the second moon of the year with a festival at which they threw flour, flowers, and perfumed water. This indigenous tradition merged with the Catholic celebration of Carnival.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

A common feature of Ecuadorian Carnival is the ''diablitos'' (little devils) who play with water. As with snowball fights, the practice of throwing or dumping water on unsuspecting victims is revered by children and teenagers although feared by some adults. Throwing water balloons, sometimes even eggs and flour both to friends and strangers is fun, but can also upset the uninformed.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Although the government as well as school authorities forbid such games, they are widely practiced. Historians tell of a bishop in 1867 who threatened [[excommunication]] for the [[sin]] of playing Carnival games.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Festivals differ across the country. Locals wear disguises with colorful masks and dance. Usually, the celebrations begin with the election of ''Taita Carnival'' (Father Carnival) who heads the festivities and leads the parades in each city.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The most famed Carnival festivities are in [[Guaranda]] (Bolivar province) and [[Ambato, Ecuador|Ambato]] (Tungurahua province). In Ambato, the festivities are called ''Fiesta de las Flores y las Frutas'' (Festival of the Flowers and Fruits). Other cities have revived Carnival traditions with colorful parades, such as in [[Azogues]] (Cañar Province). In Azogues and the Southern [[Andes]] in general, ''Taita Carnival'' is always an indigenous [[Cañari]]. Recently, a celebration has gained prominence in the northern part of the Andes in the [[Chota Valley]] in [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]] which is a zone of a strong [[Afro-Ecuadorian]] population and so the Carnival is celebrated with [[Bomba (Ecuador)|bomba del chota]] music.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Latacunga]] celebrates Carnival in three manners:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Carnival Latacunga| url=http://www.lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/1101464647/-1/Celebraci%C3%B3n_y_fiesta__en_La_Laguna.html#.Vj0nsdIrLcc| accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnival with water where people play with water, religious Carnival where people make religious festivity, and Carnival parade in the city in which people march on the Latacunga streets wearing masks while they dance with music bands.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====French Guiana====
{{Main|Carnival in French Guiana}}

The Carnival of [[French Guiana]] has roots in [[Creole peoples|Creole]] culture. Everyone participates – mainland French, Brazilians (Guiana has a frontier with Brazil), and Chinese as well as Creoles.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Its duration is variable, determined by movable religious festivals: Carnival begins at [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] and ends on Ash Wednesday, and so typically lasts through most of January and February. During this period, from Friday evening until Monday morning the entire country throbs to the rhythm of masked balls and street parades.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Friday afternoons are for eating ''galette des rois'' (the cake of kings) and drinking champagne. The cake may be flavoured with [[frangipani]], [[guava]], or [[coconut]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

On Sunday afternoons, major parades fill the streets of [[Cayenne]], [[Kourou]], and Saint-Laurent du Maroni. Competing groups prepare for months. Dressed to follow the year's agreed theme, they march with Carnival floats, drums, and brass bands.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Brazilian groups are appreciated for their elaborate feathered and sequined costumes. However, they are not eligible for competition since the costumes do not change over time.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Mythical characters appear regularly in the parades:{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
* ''Karolin'' − a small person dressed in a [[magpie]] tail and [[top hat]], riding on a [[shrew]].
* ''Les Nèg'marrons'' − groups of men dressed in red [[loincloth]]s, bearing ripe tomatoes in their mouths while their bodies are smeared with grease or [[molasses]]. They deliberately try to come in contact with spectators, soiling their clothes.
* ''Les makoumés'' − [[cross-dressing]] men (out of the Carnival context, ''makoumé'' is a pejorative term for a [[homosexual]]).
* ''Soussouris'' (the bat) − a character dressed in a winged [[leotard]] from head to foot, usually black in colour. Traditionally malevolent, this character is liable to chase spectators and "sting" them.

[[File:Toulou.jpg|thumb|right|Four touloulous]]
A uniquely Creole tradition are the ''touloulous''. These women wear decorative gowns, gloves, masks, and headdresses that cover them completely, making them unrecognisable, even to the colour of their skin. On Friday and Saturday nights of Carnival, touloulou balls are held in so-called "universities", large dance halls that open only at Carnival time. Touloulous get in free, and are even given [[condom]]s in the interest of the sexual health of the community. Men attend the balls, but they pay admittance and are not disguised. The touloulous pick their dance partners, who may not refuse. The setup is designed to make it easy for a woman to create a temporary liaison with a man in total anonymity. Undisguised women are not welcomed. By tradition, if such a woman gets up to dance, the orchestra stops playing. Alcohol is served at bars – the disguised women whisper to the men "touloulou thirsty", at which a round of drinks is expected, to be drunk through a straw protect their anonymity.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In more modern times, Guyanais men have attempted to turn the tables by staging ''soirées tololo'', in which it is the men who, in disguise, seek partners from undisguised women bystanders.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The final four days of Carnival follow a rigid schedule, and no work is done:{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
* Sunday − The Grand Parade, in which the groups compete.
* Monday − Marriage burlesque, with men dressed as brides and women as grooms.
* Tuesday − Red Devil Day in which everyone wears red or black.
* (Ash) Wednesday − Dress is black and white only, for the grand ceremony of burning the effigy of Vaval, King Carnival.

====Guatemala====
The most famous Carnival celebration in [[Guatemala]] is in [[Mazatenango]]. During February, Mazatenango is famous for its eight-day Carnival Feast. Days of food, music, parades, and games fill the streets of the department of [[Suchitepéquez]]. As one Guatemalan website states, "To mention the Carnival of Mazatenango is to bring to mind moments of a happy and cordial party. In the eight days of this celebration's duration, the local residents have kept alive the traditions of the Department."{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Haiti====
{{Main article|Haitian Carnival}}
Carnival in [[Haiti]] started in 1804 in the capital [[Port-au-Prince]] after the [[Haitian Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]]. The Port-au-Prince Carnival is one of the largest in North America. It is known as Kanaval in the [[Creole language]]. It starts in January, known as "Pre-Kanaval", while the main carnival activities begin in February. In July 2012, Haiti had another carnival called Kanaval de Fleur. Beautiful costumes, floats, [[Rara]] parades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Rara Festivals in Haiti and its Diaspora| url=http://rara.wesleyan.edu/| publisher=Wesleyan University| accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; masks, foods, and popular [[rasin]] music (such as [[Boukman Eksperyans]], Foula Vodoule, Tokay, Boukan Ginen, and Eritaj) and [[Compas|kompa]] bands (such as T-Vice, Djakout No. 1, [[Sweet Micky]], Kreyòl{{nbsp}}La, D.P. Express, Mizik Mizik, Ram, T-Micky, Carimi, Djakout Mizik, and Scorpio Fever) play for dancers in the streets of the plaza of [[Champ-de-Mars, Port-au-Prince|Champ-de-Mars]]. An annual song competition takes place.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Other places in Haiti celebrate carnival, including [[Jacmel]] and [[Aux Cayes]]. In 2013, Kanaval was celebrated in Okap ([[Cap-Haïtien]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Carnival finishes on Ash Wednesday, followed by [[rara]], another parading musical tradition known mainly in Haiti and in the Dominican Republic. This festival emphasises religion. Songs are composed each year, and bands play bamboo tubes (''vaksin'') and homemade horns (''konèt''). Rara is also performed in [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect]] and [[Central Park]] in summertime New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=McAlister| first=Elizabeth| title=Rara!

====Honduras====
In [[La Ceiba]] in [[Honduras]], Carnival is held on the fourth Saturday of every May to commemorate [[Isidore the Laborer|San Isidro]]. It is the largest Carnival celebration in [[Central America]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Mexico====
{{Main article|Carnival in Mexico}}
In [[Mexico]], Carnival is celebrated in about 225 cities and towns. The largest is in [[Mazatlán]] and the city of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], with others in [[Baja California]] and [[Yucatán]]. The larger city Carnivals employ costumes, elected queens, and parades with floats, but Carnival celebrations in smaller and rural areas vary widely depending on the level of European influence during Mexico's colonial period. The largest of these is in [[Huejotzingo]], [[Puebla]], where most townspeople take part in mock combat with rifles shooting blanks, roughly based on the [[Battle of Puebla]]. Other important states with local traditions include [[Morelos]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Tlaxcala]], and [[Chiapas]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Carnavel of Campeche is over 400 years old.

====Nicaragua====
On the Caribbean coast of [[Bluefields]], [[Nicaragua]], Carnival is better known as "Palo de Mayo" (or Mayo Ya!) and is celebrated every day of May.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDIwZ8BieWcC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=Mayo+Ya!+celebration&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4nzWf1QpHa&amp;sig=GPwrJhokWuRgzT3aUd-QM6LYf6s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2i6mS1pXSAhWF1SwKHWidBDgQ6AEIRzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Mayo%20Ya!%20celebration&amp;f=false|title=Celebrating Latino Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Cultural Traditions|last=Herrera-Sobek|first=María|date=2012-01-01|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313343391|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Managua]], it is celebrated for two days. There it is named ''Alegria por la vida'' ("Joy for Life") and features a different theme each year. Another festival in Managua celebrates patron saint Domingo de Guzman and lasts ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m0EXDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT114&amp;dq=managua%20%22santo%20domingo%20de%20guzman%22&amp;pg=PT114#v=onepage&amp;q=managua%20%22santo%20domingo%20de%20guzman%22&amp;f=false|title=Lonely Planet Nicaragua|last=Gleeson|first=Bridget|last2=Egerton|first2=Alex|date=2016-09-01|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=|isbn=9781786573049|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Panama====
Traditionally beginning on Friday and ending on the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, "los Carnavales", as [[Panama]]nians refer to the days of Carnival, are celebrated across the country. Carnival Week is especially popular because of the opulent [[Las Tablas, Los Santos|Las Tablas]] Carnival as well as the Carnival celebrations in [[Panama City]] and almost all of the [[Azuero Peninsula]]. The Panamanian Carnival is also popular because of the concerts in the most visited areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amazing-holland.nl/assets/carnaval_english.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peru====
[[File:Carnaval de juliaca.jpg|thumb|200 px|Morenada dance, in the Carnival of [[Juliaca]] – Peru]]

=====Cajamarca=====
The town of [[Cajamarca]] is considered the capital of Carnival in [[Peru]]. Local residents of all ages dance around the ''unsha'', or ''yunsa'', a tree adorned with ribbons, balloons, toys, fruits, bottles of liquor, and other prizes.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

At a certain point, the ''Mayordomo'' (governor of the feast) walks into the circle. The governor chooses a partner to go to the ''unsha'', which they attempt to cut down by striking it three times with a [[machete]]. The machete is passed from couple to couple as each strikes the tree three times. When the unsha finally falls, the crowd rushes to grab the prizes.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The person who successfully brings down the unsha becomes the following year's governor.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=====Crime=====
While generally peaceful, there have been issues with people using Carnival as a pretext for crime, particularly robbery or vandalism, especially in certain areas of Lima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://peru21.pe/noticia/407870/Carnivales-cinco-mil-policias-reforzaran-seguridad-lima |title=Carnivales en Lima: unos cinco mil policías reforzarán la seguridad&amp;#124; Perú21 |publisher=Peru21.pe |accessdate=12 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518131624/http://peru21.pe/noticia/407870/Carnivales-cinco-mil-policias-reforzaran-seguridad-lima |archivedate=18 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trinidad and Tobago====
[[File:Orange Carnival Masqueraders in Trinidad.jpg|thumb|right|Masqueraders chipping on Carnival Tuesday in [[Port of Spain]] during [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival]]]]
{{Main article|Trinidad and Tobago Carnival}}
In Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Carnival lasts months and culminates in large celebrations on the three days before Ash Wednesday with Dimanche Gras, [[J'ouvert]], and Mas (masquerade). Tobago's celebration culminates on Monday and Tuesday on a much smaller scale. Carnival combines costumes, dance, music, competitions, rum, and partying (fete-ing). Music styles include soca, [[calypso music|calypso]], [[rapso]], and more recently [[Chutney music|chutney]] and [[Chutney soca|chutney soca]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The annual Carnival [[steel pan]] competition known as the National Panorama competition holds the finals on the Saturday before the main event. Pan players compete in categories such as "Conventional Steel Band" or "Single Pan Band" by performing renditions of the year's calypsos.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

"Dimanche Gras" takes place on the Sunday night before Ash Wednesday. Here the [[Calypso Monarch]] is chosen (after competition) and prize money and a vehicle awarded. The King and Queen of the bands are crowned, where each band parades costumes for two days and submits a king and queen, from which an overall winner is chosen. These usually involve huge, complex, beautiful well-crafted costumes, that includes 'wire-bending'.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

J'ouvert, or "Dirty Mas", takes place before dawn on the Monday (known as Carnival Monday) before Ash Wednesday. It means "opening of the day". Revelers dress in costumes embodying puns on current affairs, especially political and social events. "Clean Mud" (clay mud), oil paint and body paint are familiar during J'ouvert. A common character is "Jab-jabs" (devils, blue, black, or red) complete with pitchfork, pointed horns and tails. A King and Queen of J'ouvert are chosen, based on their witty political/social messages.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[File:Carnival Costume in Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|The Carnival King costume for a particular band]]
Carnival Monday involves the parade of the mas bands. Revelers wear only parts of their costumes, more for fun than display or competition. Monday Night Mas is popular in most towns and especially the capital, where smaller bands compete. There is also the "Bomb Competition", a smaller-scaled judging of steel bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gotrinidadandtobago.com/trinidad-and-tobago/carnival-in-trinidad.html|title=Carnival in Trinidad - Trinidad &amp; Tobago - The true caribbean - Trinidad &amp; Tobago - The true caribbean|website=gotrinidadandtobago.com|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Carnival Tuesday hosts the main events. Full costume is worn, complete with make-up and body paint/adornment. Usually "Mas Boots" that complement the costumes are worn. Each band has their costume presentation based on a particular theme, and contains various sections (some consisting of thousands of revelers) that reflect these themes. The street parade and band costume competition take place. The mas bands eventually converge on the Queen's Park Savannah to pass on "The Stage" for judging.

This parading and revelry goes on until Tuesday midnight. Ash Wednesday itself, while not an official holiday, sends flocks to local beaches.

The most widely known, elaborate, and popular US events are in New Orleans where Carnival season is referred to as Mardi Gras. [[Krewe]]s organize parades, balls, and other activities. Most Louisiana cities such as [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]], [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[Mamou, Louisiana|Mamou]], [[Houma, Louisiana|Houma]], and [[Thibodaux, Louisiana|Thibodaux]], most of which were under French control at one time or another, also hold Carnival celebrations.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} On the prairie country northwest of Lafayette, Louisiana the [[Cajun]]s celebrate the traditional [[Courir de Mardi Gras]], which has its roots in celebrations from rural Medieval France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capitaine, voyage ton flag : The Traditional Cajun Country Mardi Gras| author = [[Barry Jean Ancelet]] |publisher=Center for Louisiana Studies, University of Southwestern Louisiana| date=1989 |isbn=0-940984-46-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnival celebrations, usually referred to as [[Mardi Gras]] ("Fat Tuesday" in French), were first celebrated in the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] area, but now occur in many states. Customs originated in the onetime [[Louisiana (New France)|French colonial]] capitals of [[Mardi Gras in Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] (now in [[Alabama]]), [[New Orleans]] ([[Louisiana]]), and [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] ([[Mississippi]]), all of which have celebrated for many years with street parades and masked balls. Other major American cities with celebrations include [[Washington, D.C.]]; [[St. Louis]]; [[San Francisco]]; [[San Diego]]; [[Galveston, Texas]]; and [[Miami]], [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], and [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] in [[Florida]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Carnival is celebrated in New York City in [[Brooklyn]]. As in the UK, the timing of Carnival split from the Christian calendar and is celebrated on [[Labor Day]] Monday, in September. It is called the [[Labor Day Carnival]], West Indian Day Parade, or West Indian Day Carnival, and was founded by immigrants from Trinidad. That country has one of the largest Caribbean Carnivals. In the mid twentieth century, West Indians moved the event from the beginning of Lent to the Labor Day weekend. Carnival is one of the largest parades and street festivals in New York, with over one million attending. The parade, which consists of steel bands, floats, elaborate Carnival costumes, and sound trucks, proceeds along Brooklyn's [[Eastern Parkway]] in the [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] neighborhood.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Starting in 2013, the Slovenian-American community located in the St. Clair-Superior neighborhood of [[Cleveland]] began hosting a local version of [[Kurentovanje]], the Carnival event held in the city of [[Ptuj]], [[Carnival#Slovenia|Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://clevelandkurentovanje.com/| title=Cleveland Kurentovanje| work=Cleveland Kurentovanje}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is conducted on the Saturday prior to Ash Wednesday.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Mardi Gras celebrations are spreading to other regions, such as the Mississippi Valley region of [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; Orlando, Florida in Universal Studios and in the [[Gaslamp Quarter, San Diego|Gaslamp Quarter]] of San Diego.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Uruguay====

The Carnival in Uruguay lasts more than 40 days, generally beginning towards the end of January and running through mid March. Celebrations in [[Montevideo]] are the largest. The festival is performed in the European parade style with elements from [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Angola]]n [[Benguela]] cultures imported with slaves in colonial times. The main attractions of Uruguayan Carnival include two colorful parades called ''Desfile de Carnaval'' (Carnival Parade) and ''Desfile de Llamadas'' (Calls Parade, a [[candombe]]-summoning parade).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uruguaynow.com/montevideo-Carnival.php Carnival is Coming (UruguayNow)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117020043/http://www.uruguaynow.com/montevideo-Carnival.php |date=17 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the celebration, theaters called ''tablados'' are built in many places throughout the cities, especially in Montevideo. Traditionally formed by men and now starting to be open to women, the different Carnival groups ([[Murga]]s, Lubolos, or Parodistas) perform a kind of popular opera at the ''tablados'', singing and dancing songs that generally relate to the social and political situation. The 'Calls' groups, basically formed by drummers playing the tamboril, perform [[candombe]] rhythmic figures. The carnival in Uruguay have [[escolas de samba]] too, and the biggest samba parades are in [[Artigas]] and in [[Montevideo]].  Revelers wear their festival clothing. Each group has its own theme. Women wearing elegant, bright dresses are called [[Vedette (cabaret)|vedettes]] and provide a sensual touch to parades.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

European [[archetype]]s ([[Pierrot]], [[Harlequin]], and [[Columbina]]) merge with African ancestral elements (the [[Matriarchy|Old Mother]] or ''Mama Vieja'', the [[Medicine Man]] or ''Gramillero'' and the [[magician (paranormal)|Magician]] or ''Escobero'') in the festival.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Venezuela====
Carnival in [[Venezuela]] covers two days, 40 days before Easter. It is a time when youth in many rural towns have water fights (including the use of water balloons and water guns). Any pedestrian risks a soaking. Coastal towns and provinces celebrate Carnival more fervently than elsewhere in the country. Venezuelans regard Carnival about the same way they regard Christmas and Semana Santa ([[Holy Week]]; the week before Easter Sunday) when they take the opportunity to visit their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.caribbeanchoice.com/venezuela/Carnival.asp |title=Carnival in Venezuela |publisher=CaribbeanChoice |date=5 February 2008 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, Carnival is celebrated only in the state of [[Goa]] and a Roman Catholic tradition, where it is known as '''Intruz''' which means "swindler" while ''Entrudo'' is the appropriate word in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "Carnival". The largest celebration takes place in the city of [[Panaji|Panjim]], which was part of Velha Conquista in Goa, but now is celebrated throughout the state. The tradition was introduced by the Portuguese who ruled Goa for over four centuries. On Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday, the European tradition of Fat Tuesday is celebrated with the eating of [[crepe]]s, also called "AleBelle". The crepes are filled with freshly grated [[coconut]] and heated condensed coconut sap that sequentially converts it into a brown sweet [[molasses]]; additional heat concentration solidifies it to [[jaggery]]. The celebrations of Carnival peak for three days and nights and precede Ash Wednesday, when the legendary [[King Momo]] takes over the state. All-night parades occur throughout the state with bands, dances, and floats. Grand balls are held in the evenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.navhindtimes.in/ilive/official-festival-goa-Carnival |title=The official festival of Goa, Carnival |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307152611/http://www.navhindtimes.in/ilive/official-festival-goa-carnival |archivedate=7 March 2011 |date=5 March 2011 |work=[[The Navhind Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Portugal introduced Christianity and the customs related to Catholic practice in India and Brazil, the celebrations in Goa like Portugal have begun to adopt some aspects of Brazilian-style Carnival celebrations, in particular those of Rio de Janeiro with sumptuous parades, [[samba]] and other musical elements.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Indonesia====
In [[Indonesia]], the word "carnival" or ''karnaval'' is not related to pre-[[Lent]] festivities, but more to festivals in general, especially those with processions and extravagant costumes. One of the largest carnivals in Indonesia is the [[Solo Batik Carnival]], held in [[Surakarta|Solo]], [[Central Java]]. The Jember Fashion Carnaval is held in [[Jember]], [[East Java]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jember Fashion Carnival|url=http://www.jemberfashioncarnaval.com/main.php?com=contact|website=Jember Fashion Carnival|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For almost five centuries, [[Greeks in Turkey|local Greek]] communities throughout [[Istanbul]] celebrated Carnival with weeks of bawdy parades, lavish balls, and street parties. This continued for weeks before Lent. [[Baklahorani]] took place on Shrove Monday, the last day of the carnival season. The event was led by the Greek Orthodox community, but the celebrations were public and inter-communal. The final celebration was sited in the [[Kurtuluş]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Tom| last=Heneghan| title=Istanbul celebrates carnival after nearly 70 years| url=http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2011/03/09/istanbul-celebrates-carnival-after-nearly-70-years/| agency=Reuters| accessdate=1 November 2011| date=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the festival was revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Mullins| first=Ansel| title=Reviving Carnival in Istanbul| url=http://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/reviving-carnival-in-istanbul/| work=New York Times| accessdate=1 November 2011| date=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
Many parts of [[Belgium]] celebrate Carnival, typically with costume parades, partying and fireworks. These areas include [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]], [[Binche]], [[Eupen]], [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], [[Heist-aan-Zee|Heist]], [[Kelmis]], [[Maaseik]], [[Malmedy]], and [[Stavelot]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The [[Carnival of Binche]] dates at least to the 14th century. Parades are held over the three days before Lent; the most important participants are the [[Gilles]], who wear traditional costumes on Shrove Tuesday and throw [[blood orange]]s to the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/22/travel/masked-revels-of-a-belgian-mardi-gras.html?sec=travel&amp;pagewanted=2 |title=Masked Revels of a Belgian Mardi Gras |work=New York Times |author=Anne Shapiro Devreux |date=22 January 1989 |accessdate=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Carnival of Binche was recognised as one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?cp=BE |title=UNESCO Culture Sector – Intangible Heritage – 2003 Convention: Belgium |accessdate=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carnival of Aalst]], celebrated during the three days preceding Ash Wednesday, received the same recognition in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kunstenenerfgoed.be/ake/view/nl/2626684-Aalst+Carnival+in+2010+voorgedragen+als+immaterieel+cultureel+erfgoed+van+de+mensheid+(UNESCO).html |title=Erfgoed Vlaamse gemeenschap |accessdate=12 February 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carnival of [[Malmedy]] is locally called ''Cwarmê''. Even if Malmedy is located in the east Belgium, near the German-speaking area, the ''Cwarmê'' is a pure [[Walloons|Walloon]] and Latin carnival. The celebration takes place during the four days before Shrove Tuesday. The ''Cwarmê'' Sunday is the most important and insteresting to see. All the old traditional costumes parade in the street. The ''Cwarmê'' is a "street carnival" and is not only a parade. People who are disguised pass through the crowd and perform a part of the traditional costume they wear. The famous traditional costumes at the ''Cwarmê'' of Malmedy are the ''Haguète'', the ''Longuès-Brèsses'', and the ''Long-Né''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Historique| url = http://www.malmedy.be/en/Tourisme/folklore-et-carnaval/le-carnaval/| website = www.malmedy.be| accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.''

Some Belgian cities hold Carnivals during Lent. One of the best-known is [[Stavelot]], where the ''Carnival de la Laetare'' takes place on [[Laetare Sunday]], the fourth Sunday of Lent. The participants include the ''Blancs-Moussis'', who dress in white, carry long red noses and parade through town attacking bystanders with [[confetti]] and dried [[pig bladder]]s. The town of [[Halle, Belgium#Events|Halle]] also celebrates on Laetare Sunday. Belgium's oldest parade is the [[Carnival Parade of Maaseik]], also held on Laetare Sunday, which originated in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsgd.com/specials/limburg/news/content/2018-03/15/content_181107769.htm|title=Carnival: Limburg's traditional popular festival_news_www.newsgd.com|last=Wong|first=Keane|website=www.newsgd.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the [[Croat]]-majority city of [[Ljubuški]] holds a traditional Carnival ({{lang-bs|Karneval}}). Ljubuški is a member of the [[Federation of European Carnival Cities]] (FECC).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Croatia====
The most famous [[Croatia]]n Carnival (Croatian: ''karneval'', also called ''maškare'' or ''fašnik'') is the [[Rijeka Carnival]], during which the mayor of [[Rijeka]] hands over the keys to the city to the Carnival master (''meštar od karnevala''). The festival includes several events, culminating on the final Sunday in a masked procession. (A similar procession for children takes place on the previous weekend.){{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[File:Rijeka Korzo karneval 2008.jpg|thumb|200px|Main square in [[Rijeka]] during Carnival]]

Many towns in Croatia's [[Kvarner]] region (and in other parts of the country) observe the Carnival period, incorporating local traditions and celebrating local culture.  Some of the towns and places are Grobnik, Permani, Kastav and many others places near Rijeka. Just before the end of Carnival, every Kvarner town burns a [[effigy|man-like doll]] called a "Pust", who is blamed for all the strife of the previous year. The [[Zvončari]], or bell-ringers push away winter and all the bad things in the past year and calling spring, they wear bells and large head regalia representing their areas of origin (for example, those from Halubje wear regalia in the shape of animal heads). The traditional Carnival food is [[fritule]], a pastry. This festival can also be called Poklade.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Međimurski fašnjak 2017. - coprnice z Zasadbrega.jpg|left|thumb|160px|"Coprnice" (Witches) from [[Međimurje County]], [[Northern Croatia]]]]
Masks are worn to many of the festivities, including concerts and parties. Children and teachers are commonly allowed to wear masks to school for a day, and also wear masks at school dances or while trick-or-treating. Carnivals also take place in summer. One of the most famous is the Senj Summer Carnival – first celebrated in 1968. The towns of [[Cres]], Pag, Novi Vinodolski, and Fužine also organise Summer Carnivals.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Cyprus====
Carnival has been celebrated in [[Cyprus]] for centuries. The tradition was likely established under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule around the 16th century. It may have been influenced by Greek traditions, such as festivities for deities such as [[Dionysus]]. The celebration originally involved dressing in costumes and holding masked balls or visiting friends. In the twentieth century, it became an organized event held during the 10 days preceding Lent (according to the [[Greek Orthodox]] calendar). The festival is celebrated almost exclusively in the city of [[Limassol]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Three main parades take place during Carnival. The first is held on the first day, during which the "Carnival King" (either a person in costume or an [[effigy]]) rides through the city on his carriage. The second is held on the first Sunday of the festival, and the participants are mainly children. The third and largest takes place on the last day of Carnival and involves hundreds of people walking in costume along the town's longest avenue. The latter two parades are open to anyone who wishes to participate.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Czech Republic====

[[File:Masopust masks in Milevsku (2013) 63.JPG|thumb|Masopust masks in Czech Republic, 2013]]
In the [[Czech Republic]], the Masopust Festival takes place from [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] (''Den tří králů'') through Ash Wednesday (''Popeleční středa''). The word ''masopust'' translates literally from old Czech to mean "meat fast", and the festival often includes a pork feast. The tradition is most common in [[Moravia]] but also occurs in [[Bohemia]]. While practices vary, masks and costumes are present everywhere.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Denmark and Norway====
{{Main article|Fastelavn}}
Carnival in [[Denmark]] is called ''Fastelavn'', and is held on the Sunday or Monday before Ash Wednesday. The holiday is sometimes described as a Nordic [[Halloween]], with children dressing in costume and gathering treats for the ''Fastelavn'' feast. One popular custom is the ''fastelavnsris'', a [[switch (corporal punishment)|switch]] that children use to [[flagellation|flog]] their parents to wake them up on Fastelavns Sunday.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In [[Norway]], students having seen celebrations in [[:fr:Bals du Carnival de Paris|Paris]] introduced Carnival processions, masked balls, and Carnival balls to [[Oslo|Christiana]] in the 1840s and 1850s. From 1863, the artist federation ''Kunstnerforeningen'' held annual Carnival balls in the old [[Freemasons]] lodge, which inspired [[Johan Svendsen]]'s compositions ''Norsk Kunstnerkarneval'' and ''Karneval in Paris''. The following year, Svendsen's ''Festpolonaise'' was written for the opening procession. [[Edvard Grieg]] attended and wrote "Aus dem Karneval" (''Folkelivsbilleder'' Op. 19). Since 1988, the student organization [[:no:Tårnseilerne|Tårnseilerne]] has produced annual masquerade balls in Oslo, with masks, costumes, and processions after attending an opera performance. The Carnival season also includes ''Fastelavens søndag'' (with cream buns) and ''fastelavensris'' with decorated branches.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====England====
{{Main article|Shrove Tuesday}}
In [[England]], the season immediately before Lent was called [[Shrovetide]]. A time for [[Confession (religion)|confessing sins]] ("shriving"), it had fewer festivities than the Continental Carnivals. Today, [[Shrove Tuesday]] is celebrated as [[Pancake Day]], but little else of the Lent-related Shrovetide survived the 16th-century [[English Reformation]]. The Shrovetide Carnival in the United Kingdom is celebrated in [[Cowes]] and [[East Cowes]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]. Since 2012 Hastings, East Sussex has celebrated with its own Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday.
Five days of music and street events culminating with a Grand Ball on Fat Tuesday itself. Loosely based on the New Orleans style of carnival, Hastings has taken its own course. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====France====
Some major Carnivals of mainland [[France]] are the [[Nice Carnival]], the Dunkirk Carnival and the Limoux Carnival. The [[Nice]] Carnival was held as far back as 1294, and annually attracts over a million visitors during the two weeks preceding Lent.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Since 1604, a characteristic [[Carnival of Limoux|masked Carnival]] is celebrated in [[Limoux]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The [[Dunkirk]] Carnival is among the greatest and most exuberant carnivals celebrated in Europe. Its traditions date back to the 17th century and are based on the ''vischerbende'' as fishermen went from one café to another accompanied by their relatives and friends just before departing to [[Iceland]]ic fishing grounds.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In the [[French West Indies]], it occurs between the Sunday of Epiphany and Ash Wednesday;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guadeloupe-guide.net/guadeloupe-evenements-us.php|title=Guadeloupe Guide - Events in Guadeloupe - French West Indies|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; this dates back to the arrival of French colonists in the islands.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=====Germany=====
The earliest written record of Carnival in [[Germany]] was in 1296 in [[History of Speyer|Speyer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Geschichte der Stadt Speyer''. Band 1, Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart 1982, {{ISBN|3-17-007522-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first worldwide Carnival parade took place in [[Cologne]] in 1823.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}
The most active Carnival week begins on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday, with parades during the weekend, and finishes the night before Ash Wednesday, with the main festivities occurring around ''Rosenmontag'' (Rose Monday). This time is also called the "Fifth Season". Shrove Tuesday, called ''Fastnacht'' or ''Veilchendienstag'', is celebrated in some cities.

Parties feature self-made and more fanciful costumes and occasional masks. The parties become more exuberant as the weeks progress and peak after New Year, in January and February. The final Tuesday features all-night parties, dancing, hugging, and smooching. Some parties are for all, some for women only and some for children. ''[[Kreppel]]'', or donuts, are the traditional Fasching food and are baked or fried.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In Germany, the ''Rheinische Fasching'' and the ''Schwäbische Fastnacht'' are distinct.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====="Rheinische" Carnival (Fasnacht, Fasnet, Fastabend, Fastelovend, Fasteleer, Fasching)=====
The "Rheinische" Carnival is held in the west of Germany, mainly in the states of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], but also in [[Hesse]] (including [[Upper Hesse]]), [[Bavaria]], and other states. Some cities are more famous for celebrations such as parades and costume balls. The [[Cologne Carnival]], as well as those in [[Mainz]], [[Eschweiler]] and [[Düsseldorf]], are the largest and most famous. Other cities have their own, often less well-known celebrations, parades, and parties, such as [[Worms, Germany|Worms am Rhein]], [[Speyer]], [[Kaiserslautern]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Mannheim]], [[Ludwigshafen]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Augsburg]], [[Munich]], and [[Nuremberg]]. The biggest german carnival club is located in a little town [[Dieburg]] in South Hesse. On Carnival Thursday (called "Old Women Day" or "The Women's Day" in commemoration of an 1824 revolt by washer-women), women storm city halls, cut men's ties, and are allowed to kiss any passing man. Special acrobatic show dances in mock uniforms are a traditional contribution to most festive balls. They may or may not have been a source of inspiration to American cheerleading.[[File:VSAN TT 2014 Sa17.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Reitenderle, der Grundholde, Hudelmale, Schnarragagges; popular Fasnet characters from [[Kisslegg]] im Allgäu, [[Swabia]] ]] The Fasching parades and floats make fun of individual politicians and other public figures.

====="Swabian-Alemannic" Carnival (''Schwäbische Fastnacht'')=====
The "Swabian-Alemannic" Carnival, known as ''Schwäbische Fastnacht'', takes place in [[Baden]], [[Swabia]], the [[Allgäu]], [[Alsace]], and [[Vorarlberg]] (western [[Austria]]). During the pagan era, it represented the time of year when the reign of the grim winter spirits is over, and these spirits are hunted and expelled. It then adapted to Catholicism. The first official record of Karneval, Fasching or Fastnacht in Germany dates to 1296.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=====Swiss Fasnacht=====
[[File:Monstercorso 2009.JPG|thumb|right|200px|From the ''Monstercorso'' on [[Fat Tuesday|''Güdisdienstag's'']] evening in [[Lucerne]] (2009)]]
In [[Switzerland]], ''Fasnacht'' takes place in the Catholic [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of Switzerland, e.g. in [[Lucerne#events|Lucerne]] (''Lozärner Fasnacht''), but also in Protestant [[Carnival of Basel|Basel]]. However, the ''Basler Fasnacht'' begins on the Monday ''after'' Ash Wednesday. Both began in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Smaller Fasnacht festivities take place across German Switzerland, e.g. in [[Carnival in Bern|Bern]] and [[Olten]], or in the eastern part ([[Zurich]], [[St. Gallen]], [[Appenzell]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Greece====
[[File:Kingcarnival.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The float of the King Carnival parading in [[Patras]], Greece]]
In [[Greece]], Carnival is also known as the ''Apokriés'' (Greek: Αποκριές, "saying goodbye to meat"), or the season of the "Opening of the [[Triodion]]", so named after the liturgical book used by the church from then until [[Holy Week]]. One of the season's high points is ''[[Tsiknopempti]]'', when celebrants enjoy [[roast beef]] dinners; the ritual is repeated the following Sunday. The following week, the last before Lent, is called ''Tyrinē'' (Greek: Τυρινή, "cheese [week]") because meat is forbidden, although dairy products are not. Lent begins on "[[Clean Monday]]", the day after "Cheese Sunday". Throughout the Carnival season, people disguise themselves as ''maskarádes'' ("masqueraders") and engage in pranks and revelry.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Patras]] holds the largest annual Carnival in Greece; the famous [[Patras Carnival]] is a three-day spectacle replete with concerts, ''[[Masquerade ball|balles masqués]]'', parading troupes, a [[treasure hunt]], and many events for children. The grand parade of masked troupes and floats is held at noon on ''Tyrine'' Sunday, and culminates in the ceremonial burning of the effigy of King Carnival at the Patras harbour.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Other regions host festivities of smaller extent, focused on the reenactment of traditional carnevalic customs, such as [[Tyrnavos]] ([[Thessaly]]), [[Kozani]] ([[Western Macedonia]]), [[Rethymno]] ([[Crete]]), and in [[Xanthi]] ([[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]]). Tyrnavos holds an annual Phallus festival, a traditional "phallkloric" event&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,553070,00.html "The Annual Phallus Festival in Greece"], ''Der Spiegel'', English edition, 3 June 2008, Retrieved on 15 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; in which giant, gaudily painted effigies of [[phallus]]es made of [[papier-mâché]] are paraded, and which women are asked to touch or kiss. Their reward for so doing is a shot of the famous local [[tsipouro]] alcohol spirit.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Every year, from 1 to 8 January, mostly in regions of Western Macedonia, Carnival festivals erupt. The best known is the Kastorian Carnival or "Ragoutsaria" (Gr. ''"Ραγκουτσάρια"'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tanea.gr/default.asp?pid=28&amp;ct=18&amp;artid=4548248&amp;enthDate=27112009 |title=TA NEA On-line – Τριήμερο γλεντιού στα Ραγκουτσάρια |publisher=Tanea.gr |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [tags: Kastoria, Kastorian Carnival, Ragoutsaria, Ραγκουτσαρια, Καστοριά]. It takes place from 6 to 8 January with mass participation serenaded by brass bands, pipises, and Macedonian and grand casa drums. It is an ancient celebration of nature's rebirth (festivals for [[Dionysus]] (Dionysia) and [[Cronus|Kronos]] (Saturnalia)), which ends the third day in a dance in the medieval square Ntoltso where the bands play at the same time.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Hungary====

In [[Mohács]], [[Hungary]], the ''[[Busójárás]]'' is a celebration held at the end of the Carnival season. It involves locals dressing in woolly costumes, with scary masks and noise-makers. They perform a burial ritual to symbolise the end of winter and spike [[doughnut]]s on weapons to symbolise the defeat of the [[Ottomans]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[File:Borghetto Battle of Oranges - Battaglia delle Arance 2007 - Ivrea.jpg|thumbnail|200px|The ''[[Battle of the Oranges]]'' at the carnival of [[Ivrea]]]]
The most famous Carnivals of Italy are held in [[Venice]], [[Viareggio]], and [[Ivrea]].

The [[Carnival of Venice|Carnival in Venice]] was first recorded in 1268. Its subversive nature is reflected in Italy's many laws over the centuries attempting to restrict celebrations and the wearing of [[mask]]s. Carnival celebrations in Venice were halted after the city fell under [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] control in 1798, but were revived in the late 20th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The month-long [[Carnival of Viareggio]] is characterized mainly by its parade of floats and masks [[caricature|caricaturing]] popular figures. In 2001, the town built a new "Carnival citadel" dedicated to Carnival preparations and entertainment.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The Carnival of [[Ivrea]] is famous for its "[[Battle of the Oranges]]" fought with fruit between the people on foot and the troops of the tyrant on carts, to remember the wars of the Middle Ages.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In the most part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Archdiocese]] of [[Milan]], the Carnival lasts four more days, ending on the Saturday after Ash Wednesday, because of the [[Ambrosian Rite]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Lithuania====
{{Main article|Užgavėnės}}
''Užgavėnės'' is a [[Lithuania]]n festival that takes place on Shrove Tuesday. Its name in English means "the time before Lent". The celebration corresponds to Carnival holiday traditions.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

''Užgavėnės'' begins on the night before Ash Wednesday, when an [[effigy]] of winter (usually named Morė) is burnt. A major element symbolizes the defeat of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. It is a staged battle between Lašininis ("porky") personifying winter and Kanapinis ("hempen man") personifying spring. Devils, witches, goats, the [[grim reaper]], and other joyful and frightening characters appear in costumes during the celebrations.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Eating pancakes is an important part of the celebration.{{explain|date=January 2017}}{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Luxembourg====
In [[Luxembourg]], the pre-Lenten holiday season is known as ''Fuesend''. Throughout the Grand-Duchy, parades and parties are held.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Pétange]] is the home of the Grand-Duchy's largest pre-Lenten Karneval celebration. Annually hosting a cavalcade with roughly 1,200 participants and thousand of celebrants, the official name is Karneval Gemeng Péiteng or "Kagepe" (the initials in [[Luxembourgish]] are pronounced "Ka", "Ge" and "Pe").{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The town of [[Remich]] holds a three-day-long celebration, notable for two special events in addition to its parades. The first is the ''Stréimännchen'', which is the burning of a male effigy from the Remich Bridge that crosses the [[Moselle River]] separating the Grand Duchy from [[Germany]]. The ''Stréimännchen'' symbolizes the burning away of winter. The other special event at the Remich Fuesend celebrations is the ''Buergbrennen'' or [[bonfire]] that closes the celebration.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Like Remich, the town of [[Esch-sur-Alzette]] holds a three-day celebration. Other major Fuesend parades in Luxembourg are held in the towns of [[Diekirch]] and [[Schifflange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/le-grand-duche-se-presente/fetes-traditions/carnaval/index.html |title=Fuesend (February and March) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=28 April 2015 |website=www.luxembourg.public.lu |publisher=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |access-date=5 December 2017 |quote=The best-known cavalcades are those in Diekirch, Schifflange, Esch-sur-Alzette, Remich and Pétange.

[[File:Carnival in Valletta.jpg|thumb|Carnival in Valletta, Malta]]

{{Main article|Maltese Carnival}}
Carnival in [[Malta]] (Maltese: ''il-Karnival ta' Malta'') was introduced to the islands by [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Piero de Ponte]] in 1535. It is held during the week leading up to Ash Wednesday, and typically includes masked balls, fancy dresses, and grotesque mask competitions, lavish late-night parties, a colourful, ticker-tape parade of allegorical [[float (parade)|floats]] presided over by King Carnival (Maltese: ''ir-Re tal-Karnival''), marching bands, and costumed revellers.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The largest celebration takes place in and around the capital city of [[Valletta]] and [[Floriana]]; several more "spontaneous" Carnivals take place in more remote areas. The [[Nadur Carnival]] is notable for its darker themes. In 2005, the Nadur Carnival hosted the largest-ever gathering of international Carnival organizers for the [[Federation of European Carnival Cities|FECC]]'s global summit.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Traditional dances include the ''parata'', a lighthearted re-enactment of the 1565 victory of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] over the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], and an 18th-century court dance known as ''il-Maltija''. Carnival food includes ''perlini'' (multi-coloured, sugar-coated almonds) and the ''prinjolata'', which is a towering assembly of [[sponge cake]], biscuits, almonds, and citrus fruits, topped with cream and pine nuts.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Netherlands====
{{Main article|Carnival in the Netherlands}}
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 066.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[The Fight Between Carnival and Lent]]'', [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], 1559]]
[[Carnival in the Netherlands]] is called ''Carnaval'', ''Vastenavond'' ("Eve of Lent") or, in [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]], ''Vastelaovend(j)'', and is mostly celebrated in traditionally Catholic regions, particularly in the southern provinces of [[North Brabant]], [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and [[Zeeland]], but also in [[Gelderland]], especially in [[Twente]]. While Dutch Carnaval is officially celebrated on the Sunday through Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday, since the 1970s the feast has gradually started earlier and generally includes now the preceding weekend. Although traditions vary from town to town, Dutch carnaval usually includes a parade, a "Prince Carnival" plus [[cortège]] ("Council of 11", sometimes with a [[Jester]] or Adjutant), sometimes also the handing over by the mayor of the symbolic keys of the town to Prince Carnival, the burning or burial of a symbolic figure, a [[Wedding#Peasant wedding|peasant wedding]] (''boerenbruiloft''), and eating [[herring]] (''haring happen'') on Ash Wednesday.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Two main variants can be distinguished: the ''[[Rhineland]] carnaval'', found in the province of Limburg, and the ''[[Burgundian Netherlands|Bourgondische]] carnaval'', found mainly in [[North Brabant]]. [[Maastricht]], Limburg's capital, holds a street carnaval that features elaborate costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UsnqJ_puzxsC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=origin+of+%22Dutch+Carnival%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjm3c7xu-LRAhUDQSYKHUFGCf0Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=origin%20of%20%22Dutch%20Carnival%22&amp;f=false|title=Immigrant Dialects and Language Maintenance in Australia: The Case of the Limburg and Swabian Dialects|last=Pauwels|first=Anne|date=1986-01-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110883497|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known documentation dates from the late 8th century (''[[Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum]]''), but Carnaval was already mentioned during the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 and by [[Caesarius of Arles]] (470-542) around 500 CE. In the Netherlands itself, the first documentation is found in 1383 in [['s-Hertogenbosch]]. The oldest-known images of Dutch Carnaval festivities date from 1485, also in 's-Hertogenbosch.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Normal daily life comes to a stop for about a week in the southern part of the Netherlands during the carnival, with roads temporary blocked and many local businesses closed for the week as a result of employees who are en masse taking the days off during and the day after the carnival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fenvlaanderen.be/carnaval/wat-carnaval| title=Wat is carnaval?| work=fenvlaanderen.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://members.ziggo.nl/leowethly/Carnaval/geschiedenis.htm| title=Geschiedenis van het carnavalsfeest| work=ziggo.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poland====
{{See also|Slavic carnival}}
The [[Poland|Polish]] Carnival season includes [[Fat Thursday]] (Polish: ''Tłusty Czwartek''), when ''[[pączki]]'' (doughnuts) are eaten, and ''Śledzik'' ([[Shrove Tuesday]]) or Herring Day. The Tuesday before the start of Lent is also often called ''Ostatki'' (literally "leftovers"), meaning the last day to party before the Lenten season.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The traditional way to celebrate Carnival is the ''[[kulig]]'', a horse-drawn sleigh ride through the snow-covered countryside. In modern times, Carnival is increasingly seen as an excuse for intensive partying and has become more commercialized, with stores offering Carnival-season sales.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Portugal====
[[File:Carnaval de Sesimbra 2007 24.JPG|thumb|right|Sesimbra Carnival, Portugal]]
Carnival is Carnaval in [[Portugal]], celebrated throughout the country, most famously in [[Ovar]], [[Sesimbra]], [[Madeira]], [[Loulé]], [[Nazaré, Portugal|Nazaré]], and [[Torres Vedras]]. Carnaval in [[Podence (Macedo de Cavaleiros)|Podence]] and [[Lazarim]] incorporates pagan traditions such as the [[careto]], while the Torres Vedras celebration is probably the most typical.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Although Portugal introduced Christianity and the customs related to Catholic practice to Brazil, the country has begun to adopt some aspects of Brazilian-style Carnaval celebrations, in particular those of Rio de Janeiro with sumptuous parades, samba and other musical elements.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===== Lazarim =====
[[File:Carnaval_de_Lazarim_02.jpg|thumb|Carnaval at Lazarim]]
In [[Lazarim]], a civil parish in the municipality of [[Lamego]], celebrations follow the pagan tradition of Roman [[Saturnalia]]s. It celebrates by burning colorful effigies and dressing in home-made costumes. Locally-made wooden masks are worn. The masks are effigies of men and women with horns, but both roles are performed by men. They are distinguished by their clothes, with caricature attributes of both men and women.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The Lazarim Carnaval cycle encompasses two periods, the first starting on the fifth Sunday before Quinquagesima Sunday. Masked figures and people wearing large sculpted heads walk through the town. The locals feast on meats, above all [[pork]]. The second cycle, held on Sundays preceding Ash Wednesday, incorporates the tradition of the Compadres and Comadres, with men and women displaying light-hearted authority over the other.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Over the five weeks, men prepare large masked heads and women raise funds to pay for two [[mannequin]]s that will be sacrificed in a public bonfire. This is a key event and is unique to Portugal. During the bonfire, a girl reads the Compadre's will and a boy reads the Comadre's will. The executors of the will are named, a [[donkey]] is symbolically distributed to both female and male "heirs", and then there is the final reckoning in which the Entrudo, or Carnival doll, is burned.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=====Azores=====
On the islands of the [[Azores]], local clubs and Carnival groups create colorful and creative costumes that jab at politics or culture.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

On [[São Miguel Island]], Carnival features street vendors selling fried dough, called a [[malassada]]. The festival on the biggest island starts off with a [[black tie]] grand ball, followed by Latin music at Coliseu Micaelense. A children's parade fills the streets of Ponta Delgada with children from each school district in costume. A massive parade continues past midnight, ending in [[fireworks]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The event includes theatre performances and dances. In the "Danças de Entrudo", hundreds of people follow the dancers around the island. Throughout the show the dancers act out scenes from daily life. The "Dances de Carnival" are [[allegorical]] and comedic tales acted out in the streets. The largest is in [[Angra do Heroísmo]], with more than 30 groups performing. More Portuguese-language theatrical performances occur there than anywhere else.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Festivities end on Ash Wednesday, when locals sit down for the "Batatada" or potato feast, in which the main dish is [[salted cod]] with potatoes, eggs, mint, bread and wine. Residents then return to the streets for the burning of the "Carnival clown", ending the season.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=====Madeira=====

{{Main article|Carnival of Madeira}}
On the island of [[Madeira]], the island's capital, [[Funchal]], wakes up on the Friday before Ash Wednesday to the sound of brass bands and Carnival parades throughout downtown. Festivities continue with concerts and shows in the Praça do Município for five consecutive days. The main Carnival street parade takes place on Saturday evening, with thousands of [[samba]] dancers filling the streets. The traditional street event takes place on Tuesday, featuring daring caricatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biddle|first=Anthony|title=The Madeira Islands Vol.1|date=1900|publisher=Hurst &amp; Blackett, limited|location=Philadelphia and New York|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, Brazil's Carnival could be traced to the period of the [[Age of Discovery#Portuguese exploration|Portuguese Age of Discoveries]] when their [[caravel]]s passed regularly through Madeira, a territory that emphatically celebrated Carnival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://diariodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?id_news=759044| title=Carnaval da Madeira poderá ter influenciado festividades no Brasil| work=sapo.pt| access-date=29 July 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308095006/http://diariodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?id_news=759044| archive-date=8 March 2016| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://sicnoticias.sapo.pt/cultura/2015-02-08-Historiador-diz-que-Carnaval-da-Madeira-pode-ter-influenciado-festividades-no-Brasil-| title=SIC Notícias - Cultura| work=SIC Notícias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Other regions =====
In [[Estarreja]], in the Central region of Portugal, the town's first references to Carnival were in the 14th century, with "Flower Battles", richly decorated floats that paraded through the streets. At the beginning of the twentieth century, these festivities ended with the deaths of its main promoters, only to reappear again in the 1960s to become one of many important Carnival festivals in Portugal.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In the Northern region of [[Podence e Santa Combinha|Podence]], children appear from Sunday to Tuesday with tin masks and colorful multilayered costumes made from red, green and yellow wool. In the Central Portugal towns of [[Nelas]] and [[Canas de Senhorim]], Carnival is an important tourist event. Nelas and Canas de Senhorim host four festive parades that offer colorful and creative costumes: Bairro da Igreja and Cimo do Povo in Nelas and do Paço and do Rossio in Canas de Senhorim.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Ovar Portugal Carnival.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ovar]] Carnival, Portugal]]
Carnival in the town of [[Ovar]], near Porto, began in 1952 and is the region's largest festivity, representing a large investment and the most important touristic event to the city. It is known for its creative designs, displayed in the Carnival Parade, which features troupes with themed costumes and music, ranging from the traditional to pop culture. Along with the Carnival Parade, there are five nights of partying, finishing with the famous 'Magical night' where people come from all over the country, mostly with their handmade costumes, only to have fun with the locals. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In [[Lisbon]], Carnival offers parades, dances and festivities featuring stars from Portugal and Brazil. The [[Loures]] Carnival celebrates the country's folk traditions, including the ''enterro do bacalhau'' or burial of the [[cod]], which marks the end of Carnival and the festivities.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

North of Lisbon is the famous [[Torres Vedras]] Carnival, described as the "most Portuguese in Portugal". The celebration highlight is a parade of creatively decorated streetcars that satirize society and politics.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Other Central Portugal towns, such as [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]] and [[Leiria]], offer colorful, family-friendly celebrations. In these towns, everyone dresses up as if it were [[Halloween]]. Children and adults wear masks.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In the [[Algarve]] region, several resort towns offer Carnival parades. Besides the themed floats and cars, the festivities include "samba" groups, bands, dances, and music.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmtlight.com/travel/678b87f7e05311e5bcd502004c4f4f50.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Republic of Macedonia====
The most popular Carnivals in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] are in [[Vevčani]] and [[Strumica]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The Vevčani Carnival ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: Вевчански Kарневал, translated ''Vevchanski Karneval'') has been held for over 1,400 years, and takes place on 13 and 14 January (New Year's Eve and New Year's Day by the old calendar). The village becomes a live theatre where costumed actors improvise on the streets in roles such as the traditional "August the Stupid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.macedonia.co.uk/client/index1.aspx?page=403 |title=Vevcani Carnival |publisher=Macedonia.co.uk |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Strumica Carnival ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: Струмички Карневал, translated ''Strumichki Karneval'') has been held since at least 1670, when the Turkish author Evlija Chelebija wrote while staying there, "I came into a town located in the foothills of a high hillock and what I saw that night was masked people running house–to–house, with laughter, scream and song." The Carnival took an organized form in 1991; in 1994, Strumica became a member of [[Federation of European Carnival Cities|FECC]] and in 1998 hosted the XVIII International Congress of Carnival Cities. The Strumica Carnival opens on a Saturday night at a masked ball where the Prince and Princess are chosen; the main Carnival night is on Tuesday, when masked participants (including groups from abroad) compete in various subjects. As of 2000, the Festival of Caricatures and Aphorisms has been held as part of Strumica's Carnival celebrations.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Russia====

{{See also|Slavic carnival}}

[[File:Shrovetide. Kustodiev.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boris Kustodiev]]'s painting of Maslenitsa]]
[[Maslenitsa]] ({{lang|ru|Масленица}}, also called "Pancake Week" or "Cheese Week") is a Russian folk holiday that incorporates some pagan traditions. It is celebrated during the last week before Lent. The essential element is [[bliny]], Russian pancakes, popularly taken to symbolize the sun. Round and golden, they are made from the rich foods allowed that week by the Orthodox traditions: butter, eggs, and milk. (In the tradition of Orthodox Lent, the consumption of meat ceases one week before that of milk and eggs.){{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Maslenitsa also includes [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]]s, snowball fights, sledding, swinging on swings, and sleigh rides. The mascot is a brightly dressed straw effigy of Lady Maslenitsa, formerly known as [[Kostroma (deity)|Kostroma]]. The celebration culminates on Sunday evening, when Lady Maslenitsa is stripped of her finery and put to the flames of a [[bonfire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmtlight.com/travel/678b87f7e05311e5bcd502004c4f4f50.html|title=Carnival-gmtlight|website=www.gmtlight.com|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Slovakia====
{{See also|Slavic carnival}}
In [[Slovakia]], the [[Fašiangy]] (''fašiang'', ''fašangy'') takes place from [[Three Kings Day]] (''Traja králi'') until the midnight before Ash Wednesday (''Škaredá streda'' or ''Popolcová streda''). At the midnight marking the end of ''fašiangy'', a symbolic burial ceremony for the [[contrabass]] is performed, because music ceases for [[Lent]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Slovenia====
The [[Slovenia]]n countryside displays a variety of disguised groups and individual characters, among which the most popular and characteristic is the Kurent (plural: ''Kurenti''), a monstrous and demon-like, but fluffy figure. The most significant festival is held in [[Ptuj]] (see: [[Kurentovanje]]). Its special feature are the Kurents themselves, magical creatures from another world, who visit major events throughout the country, trying to banish the winter and announce spring's arrival, fertility, and new life with noise and dancing. The origin of the Kurent is a mystery, and not much is known of the times, beliefs, or purposes connected with its first appearance. The origin of the name itself is obscure.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The [[Cerknica]] Carnival is heralded by a figure called "Poganjič" carrying a whip. In the procession, organised by the "Pust society", a monstrous witch named Uršula is driven from the mountain [[Slivnica (mountain)|Slivnica]], to be burned at the stake on Ash Wednesday. Unique to this region is a group of [[dormice]], driven by the Devil and a huge fire-breathing dragon. [[Cerkno]] and its surrounding area are known for the ''Laufarji'', Carnival figures with artistically carved wooden masks.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The ''Maškare'' from [[Dobrepolje]] used to represent a triple character: the beautiful, the ugly (among which the most important represented by an old man, an old woman, a hunchback, and a ''Kurent''), and the noble (imitating the urban elite).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The major part of the population, especially the young and children, dress up in ordinary non-ethnic costumes, going to school, work, and organized events, where prizes are given for the best and most original costumes. Costumed children sometimes go from house to house asking for treats.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Spain====
[[File:El entierro de la sardina, Francisco de Goya.jpg|thumb|left|190px|''[[The Burial of the Sardine]]'', Francisco Goya, c. 1812]]
Arguably the most famous Carnivals in Spain are [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Santa Cruz]], [[Las Palmas]], [[Sitges]], [[Vilanova i la Geltrú]], [[Tarragona]], [[Águilas]], [[Solsona, Lleida|Solsona]], [[Cádiz]], [[Badajoz]], [[Bielsa]] (an ancestral Carnival celebration), [[Plan, Aragon|Plan]], [[San Juan de Plan]], [[Laza, Spain|Laza]], [[Verín]], Viana, and [[Xinzo de Limia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

One of the oldest pre-Indo-European carnival in Europe takes place in [[Ituren]] and [[Zubieta]] in [[Navarre]] in late January/early February. The carnival symbolises the eternal struggle between the forces of good and evil, light and darkness, winter and spring.

=====Andalusia=====
{{Main article|Carnival of Cádiz}}
[[File:Carnavaldecadiz.jpg|thumb|right|A choir singing in the Carnival of [[Cádiz]]]]

In [[Cádiz]], the costumes worn are often related to recent news, such as the [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|bird flu]] epidemic in 2006, during which many people were disguised as chickens. The feeling of this Carnival is the sharp criticism, the funny play on words and the imagination in the costumes, more than the glamorous dressings. It is traditional to paint the face with [[lipstick]] as a humble substitute of a mask.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The most famous groups are the [[chirigota]]s, choirs, and [[comparsa]]s. The chirigotas are well known witty, satiric popular groups who sing about politics, new times, and household topics, wearing the same costume, which they prepare for the whole year. The Choirs (''coros'') are wider groups that go on open carts through the streets singing with an orchestra of guitars and lutes. Their signature piece is the "Carnival Tango", alternating comical and serious repertory. The comparsas are the serious counterpart of the chirigota in Cádiz, and the poetic lyrics and the criticism are their main ingredients. They have a more elaborated [[polyphony]] that is easily recognizable by the typical [[countertenor]] voice.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=====Catalonia=====
[[File:Vidalot.jpg|thumb|Vidalot is the last night of revelry before Ash Wednesday in [[Vilanova i la Geltrú|Vilanova]]. Water color painting by Brad Erickson.]]
In [[Catalonia]], people dress in masks and costume (often in themed groups) and organize a week-long series of parties, pranks, outlandish activities such as bed races, street dramas satirizing public figures, and raucous processions to welcome the arrival of ''Sa Majestat el Rei Carnestoltes'' ("His Majesty King Carnival"), known by various titles, including ''el Rei dels poca-soltes'' ("King of the Crackpots"), ''Princep etern de Cornudella'' ("Eternal Prince of Cuckoldry"), ''Duc de ximples i corrumputs'' ("Duke of Fools and the Corrupt"), ''Marquès de la bona mamella'' ("Marquis of the lovely breast"), ''Comte de tots els barruts'' ("Count of the Insolent"), ''Baró de les Calaverades'' ("Baron of Nocturnal Debaucheries"), and ''Senyor de l'alt Plàtan florit, dels barraquers i gamberrades i artista d'honor dalt del llit'' ("Lord of the Tall Banana in Bloom, of the Voyeurs and Punks and the Artist of Honor upon the Bed").&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Brad. 2008. ''Sensory Politics: Catalan Ritual and the New Immigration''. University of California, Berkeley. pp. 123-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The King presides over a period of misrule in which conventional social rules may be broken and reckless behavior is encouraged. Festivities are held in the open air, beginning with a ''cercavila'', a ritual procession throughout the town to call everyone to attend. ''Rues'' of masked revelers dance alongside. On Thursday, ''Dijous Gras'' (Fat Thursday) is celebrated, also called 'omelette day' (el ''dia de la truita''), on which ''[[coca (pastry)|coques]]'' (''de llardons, butifarra d'ou, butifarra''), and [[omelette]]s are eaten. The festivities end on Ash Wednesday with elaborate funeral rituals marking the death of King Carnival, who is typically burned on a [[pyre]] in what is called the "burial of the [[sardine]]" (''enterrament de la sardina''), or, in Vilanova, as  ''l'enterro''.&lt;ref name="Erickson, Brad 2008"&gt;Erickson, Brad. 2008. Sensory Politics: Catalan Ritual and the New Immigration. University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carnival of [[Vilanova i la Geltrú]] has a documented history from 1790&lt;ref name="Garcia, Xavier 1972"&gt;Garcia, Xavier. 1972. ''Vilanova i la Geltrú i el seu gran Carnaval''. Barcelona: Editorial Pòrtic.&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the richest in the variety of its acts and rituals. It adopts an ancient style in which satire, the [[grotesque body]]&lt;ref name=Bakhtin/&gt; (particularly [[cross-dressing]] and displays of exaggerated bellies, noses, and phalli) and above all, active participation are valued over glamorous, media-friendly spectacles that Vilanovins mock as "thighs and feathers".&lt;ref&gt;''Diari de Vilanova''. 2006. "Surten 50 carrosses a rebre un Carnestoltes que no ve". 24, 22 February.&lt;/ref&gt; It is best known for ''Les Comparses'' (held on Sunday), a tumultuous dance in which 12,000 or more dancers organized into rival groups throw 75 tons of hard candies at one other. The women protect their faces with ''Mantons de Manila'' (Manila shawls), but eye-patches and slings for broken arms are common the following week. Vilanovins organize an elaborate ritual for the arrival of King Carnival called ''l'Arrivo'' that changes every year. It includes a raucous procession of floats and dancers lampooning current events or public figures and a bitingly satiric sermon (''el sermo'') delivered by the King himself. On ''Dijous Gras,'' Vilanovin children are excused from school to participate in the ''Merengada,'' a day-long scene of eating and fighting with sticky, sweet [[meringue]].
[[File:Merengada.jpg|thumb|Children become covered in meringue during Dijous Gras.]]
Adults have a meringue battle at midnight at the historic ''Plaça de les Cols'' in the mysterious ''sortida del Moixo Foguer'' (the outing of Little-Bird-Bonfire), accompanied by the ''Xerraire'' (jabberer) who insults the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;''Diari de Vilanova''. 2006. "Plomes amb control sanitari per al Moixó". 24 February 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In the King's procession, he and his [[concubine]]s scandalize the town with their sexual behavior. A ''[[correfoc]]'' (fire run) or Devil's dance (''[[ball de diables]]''), features dancing youth amid the sparks and explosions of the ritual crew of devils. Other items includes bed races in the streets,  the debauched ''Nit dels Mascarots'', [[karaoke]] sausage roasts, ''xatonades,'' the children's party, ''Vidalet'', the last night of revelry, ''Vidalot'', the ''talking-dance'' of the Mismatched Couples (''Ball de Malcasats'') and the children's King ''Caramel'' whose massive belly, long nose and sausage-like hair hint at his insatiable appetites.
[[File:Malcasats.jpg|thumb|The Ball de Malcasats (Dance of the Mismatched Couples) is a satiric talking-dance traditional to Carnaval in Vilanova.]]
For the King's funeral, people dress in elaborate mourning costume, many of them cross-dressing men who carry bouquets of phallic vegetables. In the funeral house, the body of the King is surrounded by an honor guard and weeping concubines, crying over the loss of sexual pleasure brought about by his death. The King's body is carried to the ''Plaça de la Vila'' where a satiric eulogy is delivered while the townspeople eat salty grilled sardines with bread and wine, suggesting the symbolic [[cannibalism]] of the communion ritual. Finally, amid rockets and explosions, the King's body is burned in a massive pyre.&lt;ref name="Erickson, Brad 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garcia, Xavier 1972"/&gt;

[[File:Rucs de Solsona.jpg|thumb|right|Donkeys of Solsona, hung in the tower bell.]]
Carnaval de Solsona takes place in [[Solsona, Lleida]]. It is one of the longest; free events in the streets and nightly concerts run for more than a week. The Carnival is known for a legend that explains how a donkey was hung at the tower bell − because the animal wanted to eat grass that grew on the top of the tower. To celebrate this legend, locals hang a stuffed donkey at the tower that "pisses" above the excited crowd using a water pump. This event is the most important and takes place on Saturday night. For this reason, the inhabitants are called ''matarrucs'' ("donkey killers").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.onsortir.cat/contents/1027/so/612.jpg |title=OnSortir |work=onsortir.cat |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219004539/http://www.onsortir.cat/contents/1027/so/612.jpg |archivedate=19 February 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Comparses" groups organize free activities. These groups of friends create and personalize a uniformed suit to wear during the festivities.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In [[Sitges]], special feasts include ''xatonades'' (''[[xató]]'' is a traditional local salad of the Penedès coast) served with omelettes. Two important moments are the ''Rua de la Disbauxa'' (Debauchery Parade) on Sunday night and the ''Rua de l'Extermini'' (Extermination Parade) on Tuesday night. Around 40 floats draw more than 2,500 participants.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Tarragona]] has one of the region's most complete ritual sequences. The events start with the building of a huge barrel and ends with its burning with the effigies of the King and Queen. On Saturday, the main parade takes place with masked groups, zoomorphic figures, music, and percussion bands, and groups with [[fireworks]] (the devils, the dragon, the ox, the female dragon). Carnival groups stand out for their clothes full of elegance, showing brilliant examples of fabric crafts, at the Saturday and Sunday parades. About 5,000 people are members of the parade groups.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===== Valencian Community =====
One of the most important Spanish Carnival Festivals is celebrated in [[Vinaròs]], a small town situated in the northern part of the [[province of Castellón]], [[Valencian Community]].

The Carnival Festival in Vinaròs has been declared of Regional Touristic Interest and in 2017, this outstanding and ancient show celebrates 35 years of History. The Carnival Festival in Vinaròs became a forbidden celebration during the [[Spanish Civil War]] but after the dictatorship, the party regained importance with the democracy’s arrival.

Every year in February, forty days before the Spanish [[Cuaresma]], thirty-three “comparsas” go singing, dancing and walking down the streets in a great costumes’ parade in Vinaròs. In addition, other many festive, cultural and musical activities of all ages take place, such as an epic battle of confetti and flour, funny karaoke contests or the so-called “[[Entierro de la Sardina]]” (Burial of the Sardine).

Nevertheless, the most important event is the gala performance of the Carnival’s Queen. In this breathtaking show, it is elected the Queen of the Carnival, the major representative of the Carnival in Vinaròs all year round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slowlivingmediterraneo.com/lets-get-dressed-up-spanish-carnival-festival-in-vinaros/|title=Let’s get dressed up!

[[File:Albert Harris - Coconut shy B.jpg|thumb|240px|A carny and his [[coconut shy]] in 2005.]]
'''Carny''', also spelled '''carnie''', is an informal term used in North America for a [[traveling carnival]] employee, and the [[cant (language)|language]] they use, particularly when the employee plays a game ("joint"), food stand ("grab" or "popper"), or ride at a carnival. The term "'''showie'''" is used synonymously in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/showie |access-date=6 April 2017 | title=Definition of showie in English | publisher=[[Oxford Living Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Carny'' is thought to have become popularized around 1931 in North America, when it was first colloquially used to describe one who works at a carnival.&lt;ref name="mwod"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Carnie| title=Definition of carny| publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] Online| accessdate=November 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[carnival]]'', originally meaning a "time of merrymaking before [[Lent]]," came into use circa 1549.

==Carny language==
{{See also|Polari}}
The carny vocabulary is traditionally part of carnival [[Cant (language)|cant]], a secret language. It is an ever-changing form of communication, in large part designed to be impossible to understand by an outsider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goodmagic.com/carny/ciazarn.htm Carny]&lt;/ref&gt; As words are assimilated into the culture at large, they lose their function and are replaced by more obscure or insular terms.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Most carnies no longer use cant, but some owners/operators and "old-timers" still use some of the classic terms.

In addition to carny jargon, some carnival workers used a special infix ("earz" or "eez" or "iz") to render regular language unintelligible to outsiders. This style eventually migrated into wrestling, hip hop, and other parts of modern culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnivaltalk.wordpress.com The Secret History of Carnival Talk]&lt;/ref&gt;

The British form of fairground cant is called "Parlyaree".

'''''Carry Nation''''' is an historical play by [[Frank McGrath (playwright)|Frank McGrath]] about the temperance leader [[Carrie Nation]]. It ran on Broadway and starred American film actress [[Esther Dale]] in the title role.

==Broadway Run==
''Carry Nation'' premiered in New York on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Samuel J. Friedman Theatre|Biltmore Theatre]] on October 29, 1932 and starred [[Esther Dale]], who had been known principally as a singer up to that time. The show was produced by Dale’s husband, the writer and theater producer Arthur J. Beckhard, and was directed by stage actress [[Blanche Yurka]]. The show was playwright McGrath’s only Broadway play and closed after just 30 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = IBDB – Carry Nation | url=http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=11663 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its being a flop, the show was notable for having launched the Broadway careers of supporting actress [[Mildred Natwick]] and the actors [[James Stewart|Jimmy Stewart]], [[Myron McCormick]] and [[Joshua Logan|Josh Logan]], who had known one another at [[Princeton University]] where the three men were members of the [[University Players]] theater company. At the time, they were rooming in New York with a fourth University Player alumnus, [[Henry Fonda]]. Logan also served as assistant director to Blanche Yurka in the production. The show had originated in summer stock, and some of the young players from the earlier staging were carried over into the New York production in small roles.

Esther Dale received glowing reviews from the New York critics for her portrayal of Carry (sic). In addition to Dale, the featured performers included Leslie Adams, [[Donald Foster (actor)|Donald Foster]], [[Daisy Belmore]], Byron McGrath, John Parrish, Ernest Pollock and Fannie Bell De Knight.

==Synopsis of Scenes==
The story line of the play followed the chronology of the prohibitionist leader's life, beginning with her birth in 1846 in Kentucky to a zealously pious father, her marriage to a chronic drunk, a second marriage to a country preacher, her public campaign against Demon Rum and her infamous marches culminating in the axing of booze barrels. The story concluded with her final appearance before a Town Hall gathering in Tennessee in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Hischak, Thomas S.

The '''Cincinnati Fringe Festival (Cincy Fringe)''', produced by [[Know Theatre of Cincinnati]], was founded in Cincinnati, Ohio in 2004 and is now Ohio’s largest Performing Arts festival. It consists of 13 days of theatre, art, music, dance, and everything between and always begins the day after Memorial Day. Cincy Fringe uses over a dozen venues in the heart of the [[Over-the-Rhine]] neighborhood to present independently produced works from local, national, and international artists.

The '''Collective for Living Cinema''' was an outpost of [[avant-garde]] cinema located on White Street in [[Lower Manhattan]] in the [[United States of America]]. It regularly presented work by filmmakers such as [[Ken Jacobs]], [[Johan van der Keuken]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Christine Vachon]], [[Dziga Vertov]] and many others who created films that were outside of the commercial mainstream in the United States. It also published a number of scholarly journals on film. Many of the founders studied film at [[Binghamton University]] together, where they developed a particular interest in the avant-garde.

A recent retrospective show on the Collective's program organized by ORCHARD (orchard47.org) included the following note in its press release:

==Formation==
In 1973 a group of film students from the [[Binghamton University]] Cinema Department looking to create a contemporary and fertile context for their work found The Collective for Living Cinema, an artist-run cooperative that would serve both as an exhibition venue and a center for production and discourse. Above the first program note was a miniature manifesto stating their intention to “overcome the economic, social and political burdens of an art in chains.” Lasting for 19 years, The Collective came to embody the under-defined moment between the canonized generation of “the essential cinema” and the transfiguration of film as “new media” embraced by the institutional hierarchy of the art world and subject to the theoretical, critical and economic tidal forces therein. Run as a multi-disciplinary venue, The Collective continuously engaged in a recovery of the recent past, championing the marginal and positing alternative film histories. The screening room was seen as a workshop in which this culture became immersed in its own brand of cinematic delirium. Annette Michelson pointed out that The Collective "attempted to break down distinctions between industrial film and avant garde film, between films that form part of a classical canon and those which are on the margins or periphery of canonical taste." By "maintaining and constantly questioning an exploratory attitude rather than by embalming predigested classical canon", Michelson stated, The Collective emerged in the 1980s as the "liveliest" New York film venue of its time.

This exhibition will re-examine the Collective’s history and parallel its mission within the current set of “economic, social and political chains.” It has been organized as a series of individually programmed screening events at ORCHARD (April 6–8 to be held at Anthology Film Archive), a timeline of documentation and an installation specific to the ambivalent capacity of cinema to enter the gallery through production / distribution on video.

==Relocation==
In the late 1980s, the Collective was forced to move from its 52 White Street location (due to legal and financial issues related to the building's [[certificate of occupancy]] and the NYC building codes for motion picture theaters) to a new space across the street. With rising costs and the [[gentrification]] of [[TriBeCa]], and reductions in funding from the then-beleaguered National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts, the Collective closed its doors in 1993. The last home of the Collective, at 41 White Street, was for some time [[The Flea Theater]] before they moved to their current location.

==Members==
Original founders included Ken Ross, Philip Weisman, Lushe Sacker, Mark Graff, [[Renée Shafransky]].  Many people affiliated with the Collective for Living Cinema were or have gone on to be quite influential in media, such the late Alf Bold, the former programmer of the [[Arsenal Kino]] in Berlin, [[Judith Shulevitz]], the columnist for ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', and [[John Sloss]], the attorney and film producer who has produced more than 40 films, including ''[[Far From Heaven]]'', ''[[Before Sunset]]'', ''[[Personal Velocity]]'', and ''[[The Fog of War]]''.

Others are noted artists such as the filmmaker [[Lizzie Borden (director)|Lizzie Borden]], who very appropriately taught film editing at the Collective.

The Italian [[Risorgimento]] was celebrated by a series of medals set up by the three kings who ruled during the long process of unification - the '''Commemorative Medal for the Campaigns of the War of Independence''' and the various versions of the '''Commemorative Medal of the Unity of Italy''', which were granted by the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] to those who had taken part in the military operations which had led to Italian independence and later to all who participated in the [[First World War]], since at that time it was traditionally held that Italy completed its unification with the annexation of the [[Trentino]]. Its final awards were to participants in the [[March on Rome]] and the [[Impresa di Fiume]].

{{refimprove|date=August 2018}}
'''Dogma''' is an official system of principles or tenets of a church, such as [[Roman Catholicism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05089a.htm|title=Dogma|last=|first=|date=|website=New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the positions of a philosopher or of a philosophical school such as [[Stoicism]].

In the pejorative sense, dogma refers to enforced decisions, such as those of aggressive political interests or authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dogma &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;], "dogma." Merriam-Webster.com | An Encyclopædia Britannica Company, Inc. 1831 | &lt;www.merriam-webster.com/about-us/faq&gt; http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dogma&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dogma|title=Dogma|last=|first=|date=|website=dictionary.com|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, it is applied to some strong belief whose adherents are not willing to rationally discuss it. This attitude is named as a dogmatic one, or as dogmatism; and is often used to refer to matters related to religion, but is not limited to theistic attitudes alone and is often used with respect to political or philosophical dogmas.

==Etymology==
"Dogma" is transliterated in the 17th century from Latin (Latin: ''dogma'') meaning "philosophical tenet", derived from the Greek ''dogma'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|δόγμα}}) meaning literally "that which one thinks is true" and ''dokein'' (Greek: ''dokeo'') "to seem good".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dogma|title=Dogma (n)|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|access-date=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dogma|title=Dogma|last=|first=|date=|website=The Free Encyclopedia by Farlex|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==
Formally, the term dogma has been used by some theistic religious groups to describe the body of positions forming the group's most central, foundational, or essential beliefs, though the term may also be used to refer to the entire set of formal beliefs identified by a theistic or non-theistic religious group.  In some cases dogma is distinguished from religious opinion and those things in doctrine considered less significant or uncertain. Formal church dogma is often clarified and elaborated upon in its communication.

=== Buddhism===
[[View (Buddhism)|View]] or position ([[Pali]] ''{{IAST|diṭṭhi}}'', [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|dṛṣṭi}}'') is a central idea in [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Fuller|2005|page=1}} In Buddhist thought, a view is not a simple, abstract collection of propositions, but a charged interpretation of experience which intensely shapes and affects thought, sensation, and action.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus 2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=Dan|last=Lusthaus|title=Buddhist Phenomenology|url=http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/buddhist_phenomenology_-_a_pholosophical_investigation_of_yogacara_buddhism_and_the_cheng_wei-shih_lun.pdf|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|page=242, n. 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having the proper mental attitude toward views is therefore considered an integral part of the Buddhist path, as sometimes correct views need to put into practice and incorrect views abandoned, and sometimes all views are seen as obstacles to enlightenment.{{sfn|Fuller|2005|pages=1–2}}

=== Christianity ===
Christianity is defined by a set of core beliefs shared by virtually all Christians, though how those core beliefs are implemented and secondary questions vary within Christianity. When formally communicated by the organization, these beliefs are sometimes referred to as 'dogmata.'   The organization's formal religious positions may be taught to new members or simply communicated to those who choose to become members. It is rare for agreement with an organization's formal positions to be a requirement for attendance, though membership may be required for some church activities.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t98.e978], "dogma"  The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy. Simon Blackburn. Oxford University Press,  2011  &lt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t98.e978&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protestantism|Protestants]] to differing degrees are less formal about doctrine, and often rely on denomination-specific beliefs, but seldom refer to these beliefs as dogmata. The first unofficial institution of dogma in the Christian church was by Saint Irenaeus in his writing, Demonstration of Apostolic Teaching, which provides a 'manual of essentials' constituting the 'body of truth'. So initially, dogma is concerned with truth.

==== Catholicism ====
{{main|Dogma in the Catholic Church}}
For [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Christianity]], the dogmata are contained in the [[Nicene Creed]] and the [[canon law]]s of two, three, seven, or twenty [[ecumenical council]]s (depending on whether one is [[Church of the East|"Nestorian"]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], or [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]). These tenets are summarized by [[St. John of Damascus]] in his ''Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith'', which is the third book of his main work, titled ''The Fount of Knowledge''. In this book he takes a dual approach in explaining each article of the faith: one, directed at Christians, where he uses quotes from the [[Bible]] and, occasionally, from works of other [[Church Fathers|Fathers of the Church]], and the second, directed both at members of non-Christian religions and at [[atheist]]s, for whom he employs [[term logic|Aristotelian logic]] and [[dialectics]].

The decisions of fourteen later councils that Catholics hold as dogmatic and a small number of decrees promulgated by [[pope]]s exercising [[papal infallibility]] (for examples, see [[Immaculate Conception]] and [[Assumption of Mary]]) are considered as being a part of the Church's sacred body of doctrine.

=== Islam ===
{{See also|The six articles of Islamic faith}}
In [[Islam]] the Latin terms dogma and dogmata are used to describe the Quran'', [[Hadith]]'', ''[[aqidah]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Philosophy ==

===Pyrrhonism===
[[Pyrrhonism#Philosophy|Pyrrhonism's]] objective is principally psychological, although it is best known for its [[Epistemology|epistemological]] arguments, particularly the [[problem of the criterion]] and the [[problem of induction]]. Through [[epoché]] ([[suspension of judgment]]) the mind is brought to [[ataraxia]], a state of equanimity. As in [[Stoicism]] and [[Epicureanism]], [[eudaimonia]] is the Pyrrhonist goal of life, and all three philosophies placed it in [[ataraxia]] or [[apatheia]].&lt;ref name="brittania1911"/&gt; According to the Pyrrhonists, it is one's opinions about non-evident matters that prevent one from attaining eudaimonia.

The main principle of Pyrrho's thought is expressed by the word ''[[acatalepsia]]'', which connotes the ability to withhold assent from doctrines regarding the truth of [[Noumenon|things in their own nature]]; against every statement its contradiction may be advanced with equal justification.

Pyrrhonists withhold assent with regard to non-evident propositions, that is, dogma. They disputed that the dogmatists had found truth regarding non-evident matters. For any non-evident matter, a Pyrrhonist tries to make the arguments for and against such that the matter cannot be concluded, thus suspending belief. According to Pyrrhonism, even the statement that nothing can be known is [[dogmatism|dogmatic]]. They thus attempted to make their skepticism universal, and to escape the reproach of basing it upon a fresh dogmatism.&lt;ref name="brittania1911"&gt;{{EB1911|title=Scepticism |url=http://www.studylight.org/enc/bri/view.cgi?number=29138 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mental imperturbability (''[[ataraxia]]'') was the result to be attained by cultivating such a frame of mind.&lt;ref name="brittania1911"/&gt;

Pyrrhonians (or Pyrrhonism) can be subdivided into those who are [[ephectics|ephectic]] (a "suspension of judgment"), zetetic ("engaged in seeking"), or [[aporia|aporetic]] ("engaged in refutation").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Etymological Compendium, Or, Portfolio of Origins and Inventions |last=Pulleyn |first=William |publisher=T. Tegg |year=1830 |isbn= |location= |pages=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrrhonism is credited with being the first Western school of philosophy to identify the [[problem of induction]], and the [[Münchhausen trilemma]].

{{Violence against women}}
{{Violence against men}}
'''Domestic violence''' (also named '''domestic abuse''' or '''family violence''') is [[violence]] or other [[abuse]] by one person against another in a domestic setting, such as in [[marriage]] or [[cohabitation]]. It may be termed ''[[intimate partner violence]]'' when committed by a [[spouse]] or partner in an [[intimate relationship]] against the other spouse or partner, and can take place in [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or [[Domestic violence in same-sex relationships|same-sex]] relationships, or between former spouses or partners. Domestic violence can also involve violence against children, parents, or the elderly. It takes a number of forms, including [[physical abuse|physical]], [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[emotional abuse|emotional]], [[economic abuse|economic]], [[Religious abuse|religious]], [[Reproductive coercion|reproductive]], and [[sexual abuse]], which can range from subtle, coercive forms to [[marital rape]] and to violent physical abuse such as choking, beating, [[female genital mutilation]], and [[acid throwing]] that results in [[disfigurement]] or death. Domestic murders include [[stoning]], [[bride burning]], [[honor killing]]s, and [[dowry death]]s.

Globally, the victims of domestic violence are overwhelmingly women, and women tend to experience more severe forms of violence.&lt;ref name="McQuigg"&gt;{{citation | last = McQuigg | first = Ronagh J.A. | contribution = Potential problems for the effectiveness of international human rights law as regards domestic violence| editor-last = McQuigg | editor-first = Ronagh J.A. | title = International human rights law and domestic violence: the effectiveness of international human rights law | page = 13 | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | location = Oxford New York| year = 2011 | isbn = 9781136742088 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ltJxlsoMV4wC&amp;pg=PR13 | quote = This is an issue that affects vast numbers of women throughout all nations of the world.

Domestic violence often occurs when the abuser believes that abuse is an entitlement, acceptable, justified, or unlikely to be reported. It may produce an [[intergenerational cycle of abuse]] in children and other family members, who may feel that such violence is acceptable or condoned. Many people do not recognize themselves as abusers or victims because they may consider their experiences as family conflicts that got out of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10896-013-9555-4 |title=Stay with or Leave the Abuser?

Traditionally, domestic violence (DV) was mostly associated with physical violence. Terms such as ''wife abuse'', ''wife beating'', and ''wife'' ''battering'' were used, but have declined in popularity due to efforts to include unmarried partners, abuse other than physical, female perpetrators, and same-sex relationships.{{refn|Terms such wife abuse, wife beating, and battering are descriptive terms that have lost popularity recently for several reasons:

In most legal systems around the world, domestic violence has been addressed only from the 1990s onwards; indeed, before the late-20th century, in most countries there was very little protection, in law or in practice, against DV.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Smith | first = Bonnie G. | contribution = Domestic violence: overview | editor-last = Smith | editor-first = Bonnie G. | title = The Oxford encyclopedia of women in world history | page = 94 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford England New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780195148909}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the UN published ''Strategies for Confronting Domestic Violence: A Resource Manual''.&lt;ref name=Strategies_UNODC&gt;{{cite book | last = UNODC | author-link = United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | title = Strategies for confronting domestic violence: a resource manual | url = https://www.unodc.org/pdf/youthnet/tools_strategy_english_domestic_violence.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)]] | location = New York | isbn = 9789211301588 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205040711/https://www.unodc.org/pdf/youthnet/tools_strategy_english_domestic_violence.pdf | archivedate = 2016-02-05 | df =  | year = 1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication urged countries around the world to treat DV as a criminal act, stated that the right to a private family life does not include the right to abuse family members, and acknowledged that, at the time of its writing, most legal systems considered DV to be largely outside the scope of the law, describing the situation at that time as follows: "Physical discipline of children is allowed and, indeed, encouraged in many legal systems and a large number of countries allow moderate physical chastisement of a wife or, if they do not do so now, have done so within the last 100 years. Again, most legal systems fail to criminalize circumstances where a wife is forced to have sexual relations with her husband against her will. [...] Indeed, in the case of violence against wives, there is a widespread belief that women provoke, can tolerate or even enjoy a certain level of violence from their spouses."&lt;ref name=Strategies_UNODC /&gt;

In recent decades, there has been a call for the end of legal impunity for domestic violence, an impunity often based on the idea that such acts are private.&lt;ref name="who.intB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt; The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] is the first legally binding instrument in Europe dealing with domestic violence and violence against women.&lt;ref name="oas.org"/&gt; The convention seeks to put an end to the toleration, in law or in practice, of violence against women and DV. In its explanatory report it acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring, ''de jure'' or ''de facto'', these forms of violence.&lt;ref name=CofE_CETS210&gt;{{cite web | last = Council of Europe | author-link = Council of Europe | title = Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210) | url = http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm | website = conventions.coe.int | publisher = [[Council of Europe]] | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150720234156/http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm | archivedate = 20 July 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; At para 219, it states: "There are many examples from past practice in Council of Europe member states that show that exceptions to the prosecution of such cases were made, either in law or in practice, if victim and perpetrator were, for example, married to each other or had been in a relationship. The most prominent example is rape within marriage, which for a long time had not been recognised as rape because of the relationship between victim and perpetrator."&lt;ref name=CofE_CETS210 /&gt;

There has been increased attention given to specific forms of domestic violence, such as honor killings, dowry deaths, and forced marriages. India has, in recent decades, made efforts to curtail dowry violence: the [[Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005|Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act]] (PWDVA) was enacted in 2005, following years of advocacy and activism by the women's organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Confronting dowry-related violence in India: women at the center of justice | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2012/12/confronting-dowry-related-violence-in-india-women-at-the-center-of-justice | website = unwomen.org | publisher = [[UN Women]] | date = 24 December 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141107103046/http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2012/12/confronting-dowry-related-violence-in-india-women-at-the-center-of-justice | archivedate = 7 November 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crimes of passion]] in Latin America, a region which has a history of treating such killings with extreme leniency, have also come to international attention. In 2002, Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, argued that there are similarities between the dynamics of crimes of passion and honor killings, stating that: "crimes of passion have a similar dynamic [to honor killings] in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Thousands of women killed for family "honor" | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html | work = [[National Geographic News]] | publisher = [[National Geographic Society]] | date = 28 October 2010 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151019011522/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html | archivedate = 19 October 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, children had few protections from violence by their parents, and in many parts of the world, this is still the case. For example, in Ancient Rome, a father could legally kill his children. Many cultures have allowed fathers to sell their children into [[slavery]]. [[Child sacrifice]] was also a common practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Szasz | first = Thomas | title = Cruel compassion: psychiatric control of society's unwanted | publisher = [[Syracuse University Press]] | location = Syracuse, New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780815605102 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2pduB22E43oC | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151018130406/https://books.google.com/books?id=2pduB22E43oC | archivedate = 2015-10-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Child maltreatment began to garner mainstream attention with the publication of "The Battered Child Syndrome" by pediatric psychiatrist [[C. Henry Kempe]]. Prior to this, injuries to children—even repeated bone fractures—were not commonly recognized as the results of intentional trauma. Instead, physicians often looked for undiagnosed [[bone disease]]s or accepted parents' accounts of accidental mishaps such as falls or assaults by neighborhood bullies.&lt;ref name=Childism&gt;{{cite book |author=Young-Bruehl, Elisabeth |date=2012 |title=Childism: Confronting Prejudice Against Children |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-17311-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|100–103}}

Limitations of [[methodology]], such as the [[conflict tactics scale]], that fail to capture injury, homicide, and sexual violence rates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamby|first=Sherry|date=2014-05-28|title=Measuring Intimate Partner Violence: A Multi-Study Investigation of Gender Patterns|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268125313}}&lt;/ref&gt; context (e.g., motivations, fear), disparate [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] procedures, respondent reluctance to self-report, and differences in [[operationalization]] all pose challenges to existing research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamby|first=Sherry|date=2017-04-01|title=On defining violence, and why it matters|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315967513|journal=Psychology of Violence|volume=7|issue=2|pages=167–180|doi=10.1037/vio0000117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chan2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Chan | first = Ko Ling | title = Gender differences in self-reports of intimate partner violence: a review | journal = [[Aggression and Violent Behavior]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–175 | doi = 10.1016/j.avb.2011.02.008 | date = March–April 2011 | url = http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134467/1/Content.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208161311/http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134467/1/Content.pdf | archivedate = 2015-12-08 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Chan | first = Ko Ling | title = Gender symmetry in the self-reporting of intimate partner violence | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 263–286 | doi = 10.1177/0886260511416463 | pmid = 21920874 | date = January 2012 | url = http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134462/1/Content.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208152121/http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134462/1/Content.pdf | archivedate = 2015-12-08 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Rose | first = Susan D. | contribution = Gender violence: the problem | editor-last = Rose | editor-first = Susan D. | title = Challenging global gender violence: the global clothesline project | pages = 12–13 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781137388483 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HZsKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160501065849/https://books.google.com/books?id=HZsKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12 | archivedate = 2016-05-01 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Normalization (sociology)|Normalization]] of domestic violence in those who experience covert forms of abuse, or have been abused by multiple partners, for long periods of time, reduces the likelihood of recognizing, and therefore reporting, domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Boundless | author-link = Boundless (company) | contribution = Spousal abuse | editor-last = Boundless | editor-link = Boundless (company) | title = Sociology | pages = 898–899 | publisher = [[Boundless (company)|Boundless]] | location = Boston, Massachusetts | isbn = 9781940464374}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=kbLpAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA899 Details.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022140457/https://books.google.com/books?id=kbLpAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA899 |date=2015-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many organizations have made efforts to use gender-neutral terms when referring to perpetration and victimization.

Researchers have also found different outcomes for men and women in response to intimate partner violence. A 2012 review from the journal ''[[Psychology of Violence]]'' found that women suffered disproportionately as a result of intimate partner violence, especially in terms of injuries, fear, and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0026296 |title=Gender differences in intimate partner violence outcomes |journal=Psychology of Violence |volume=2 |pages=42–57 |year=2012 |last1=Caldwell |first1=Jennifer E |last2=Swan |first2=Suzanne C |last3=Woodbrown |first3=V. Diane }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review also found that 70% of female victims in one study were "very frightened" in response to IPV from their partners, but 85% of male victims reported "no fear", and that IPV mediated the satisfaction of the relationship for women but not for men.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Hamberger's (2005) review found that men tend to respond to female partner-initiated IPV with laughter and amusement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamberger|first=L.

A 2013 review examined studies from five [[continents]] and the correlation between a country's level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence. The authors found that when partner abuse is defined broadly to include emotional abuse, any kind of hitting, and who hits first, partner abuse is relatively even. They also stated if one examines who is physically harmed and how seriously, expresses more fear, and experiences subsequent psychological problems, domestic violence is significantly gendered toward women as victims.&lt;ref name="Eugenio"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Esquivel-Santovena |first1=Esteban Eugenio | last2=Lambert | first2=Teri | last3=Hamel | first3=John | title = Partner abuse worldwide | journal = Partner Abuse | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1891/1946-6560.4.1.e14 |url =http://domesticviolenceresearch.org/pdf/PASK.Tables14.Revised.pdf| date = January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws on domestic violence vary by country. While it is generally outlawed in the [[Western world]], this is not the case in many [[developing countries]]. For instance, in 2010, the United Arab Emirates's Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = CNN Wire Staff | title = Court in UAE says beating wife, child OK if no marks are left | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120325143850/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-19/world/uae.court.ruling_1_islamic-law-sharia-law-ruling?_s=PM%3AWORLD | archive-date = 25 March 2012 | url = https://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-19/world/uae.court.ruling_1_islamic-law-sharia-law-ruling?_s=PM:WORLD | website = cnn.com | publisher = CNN | date = 19 October 2010 | access-date = 24 January 2014 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The social acceptability of domestic violence also differs by country. While in most developed countries domestic violence is considered unacceptable by most people, in many regions of the world the views are different: according to a [[UNICEF]] survey, the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is, for example: 90% in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Jordan]], 87% in [[Mali]], 86% in [[Guinea]] and [[Timor-Leste]], 81% in [[Laos]], 80% in [[Central African Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Childinfo | title = Attitudes towards wife beating: percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband/partner is justified in hitting or beating his wife/partner under certain circumstances | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140704112113/http://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php | archive-date = 4 July 2014 | url = https://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php | website = childinfo.org | publisher = Childinfo: monitoring the situation of children and women | accessdate = 8 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Refusing to submit to a husband's wishes is a common reason given for justification of violence in developing countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140214095207/http://www.measuredhs.com/ | archive-date = 14 February 2014 | url = https://www.measuredhs.com/ | publisher = Measure DHS (Demographic and Health Surveys): Quality information to plan, monitor and improve population, health, and nutrition programs | date = 4 April 2013 | accessdate = 8 September 2013 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance 62.4% of women in [[Tajikistan]] justify wife beating if the wife goes out without telling the husband; 68% if she argues with him; 47.9% if she refuses to have sex with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = State Committee on Statistics of the Republic of Takistan | title = Tajikistan multiple indicator cluster survey 2005, final report | publisher = State Committee on Statistics of the Republic of Takistan | url = http://www.childinfo.org/files/MICS3_Tajikistan_FinalReport_2005_Eng.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213608/http://www.childinfo.org/files/MICS3_Tajikistan_FinalReport_2005_Eng.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2015-09-23| location = Dushanbe, Tajikistan | date = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women]] (1993) states that "[[violence against women]] is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which has led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men".&lt;ref name="UN GA Res" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UNFPA | author-link = United Nations Population Fund | title = UNFPA strategy and framework for action to addressing gender-based violence 2008–2011 | url = http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/2009_add_gen_vio.pdf | publisher = United Nations Population Fund | location = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780897149518 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://perma-archives.org/warc/20160112155127/http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/2009_add_gen_vio.pdf | archivedate = 2016-01-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women classifies violence against women into three categories: that occurring in the family (DV), that occurring within the general community, and that perpetrated or condoned by the State.&lt;ref name="UN GA Res" /&gt;

The Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women defines violence against women as "any act or conduct, based on gender, which causes death or physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, whether in the public or the private sphere".&lt;ref name=Treaties&gt;{{cite web | title = Multilateral treaties: Inter-American convention on the prevention, punishment and eradication of violence against women "Convention of Belém do Pará" | url = http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html | website = oas.org | publisher = Department of International Law, [[Organization of American States]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160413001826/http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html | archivedate = 2016-04-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly with the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, it classifies violence against women into three categories; one of which being DV – defined as violence against women which takes place "within the family or domestic unit or within any other interpersonal relationship, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the woman".&lt;ref name=Treaties /&gt;

The [[Maputo Protocol]] adopted a broader definition, defining violence against women as: "all acts perpetrated against women which cause or could cause them physical, sexual, psychological, and economic harm, including the threat to take such acts; or to undertake the imposition of arbitrary restrictions on or deprivation of fundamental freedoms in private or public life in peace time and during situations of armed conflicts or of war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = ACHPR | author-link = African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights | title = Protocol to the African charter on human and peoples' rights on the rights of women in Africa | url = http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol/ | publisher = [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] | date = 11 July 2003 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151202092756/http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol | archivedate = 2 December 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Femicide]] is usually defined as the gender-based killing of women by men, although the exact definitions vary.  Femicides often occur in the context of DV, such as honor killings or dowry killings. For statistical purposes, femicide is often defined as any killing of a woman. The top countries by rate of femicide are [[El Salvador]], [[Jamaica]], [[Guatemala]], [[South Africa]] and [[Russia]] (data from 2004–09).&lt;ref name="smallarmssurvey.org"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Small Arms Survey | author-link = Small Arms Survey | title = Femicide: a global problem — research note 14 | journal = [[Small Arms Survey|Small Arms Survey Research Notes]] | date = February 2012 | url = http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/about-us/highlights/highlight-rn14.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205035809/http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/about-us/highlights/highlight-rn14.html | archivedate = 2016-02-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in El Salvador and Colombia, which have a very high rate of femicide, only three percent of all femicides are committed by a current or former intimate partner, while in [[Cyprus]], [[France]], and [[Portugal]] former and current partners are responsible for more than 80% of all cases of femicide.&lt;ref name="smallarmssurvey.org"/&gt;

While the general literature indicates that adolescent boys and girls engage in IPV at about equal rates, females are more likely to use less dangerous forms of physical violence (e.g. pushing, pinching, slapping, scratching or kicking), while males are more likely to punch, strangle, beat, burn, or threaten with weapons. Males are also more likely to use sexual aggression, although both genders are equally likely to pressure their partner into sexual activities. In addition, females are four times more likely to respond as having experienced rape and are more likely to suffer fatal injuries inflicted by their partner, or to need psychological help as a result of the abuse. Females are more likely to consider IPV a serious problem than are their male counterparts, who are more likely to disregard female-perpetrated IPV.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Poet&gt;{{citation | last1 = Poet | first1 = Andrea | last2 = Swiderski | first2 = Catherine R. | last3 = McHugh | first3 = Maureen C. | contribution = Developing teen relationships: the role of violence | editor-last = Paludi | editor-first = Michele A. | title = The psychology of teen violence and victimization, volume 1, Part III.

There is a strong link between domestic violence and child abuse. Since domestic violence is a pattern of behavior, these incidences may increase in severity and frequency, resulting in an increased probability the children themselves will become victims. The estimated overlap between domestic violence and child abuse ranges from 30 to 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vawnet.org/Assoc_Files_VAWnet/PCAA_DVandChild.pdf|date=September 1996|title=The Relationship Between Domestic Violence and Child Abuse|publisher=Prevent Child Abuse America|accessdate=2016-04-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207171540/http://www.vawnet.org/Assoc_Files_VAWnet/PCAA_DVandChild.pdf|archivedate=2015-12-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay and lesbian relationships have been identified as a risk factor for abuse in certain populations.&lt;ref name="Siemieniuk 2010 763–770"/&gt; LGBT people in some parts of the world have very little legal protection from DV, because engaging in homosexual acts is itself prohibited by the "[[sodomy laws]]" of those jurisdictions (as of 2014, same-sex sexual acts are punishable by imprisonment in 70 countries and by death in another 5 countries)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Rodgers | first1 = Lucy | last2 = Gutierrez Martin | first2 = Pablo Gutierrez Martin | last3 = Rees | first3 = Martyn | last4 = Connor | first4 = Steven | title = Where is it illegal to be gay? | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-25927595 | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher = BBC | date = 10 February 2014 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150812100906/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-25927595 | archivedate = 12 August 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these legal prohibitions prevent LGBT victims of DV from reporting the abuse to authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Serra | first = Natalie E. | title = Queering international human rights: LGBT access to domestic violence remedies | journal = Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 583–607 | date = 2013 | url = http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1611&amp;context=jgspl | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140819082107/http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1611&amp;context=jgspl | archivedate = 2014-08-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of the 2003 Supreme Court decision, 13 US states have refused to remove sodomy laws from legislation as of 2013.&lt;ref name="Chen 2013"/&gt;

People in same-sex relationships face special obstacles in dealing with the issues that some researchers have labeled "the double closet". A 1997 Canadian study by Mark W. Lehman suggests similarities include frequency (approximately one in every four couples); manifestations (emotional, physical, financial, etc.); co-existent situations (unemployment, substance abuse, low self-esteem); victims' reactions (fear, feelings of helplessness, hypervigilance); and reasons for staying (love, can work it out, things will change, denial).&lt;ref name="Lehman 1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lehman | first = Mark Warren | title = At the end of the rainbow: a report on gay male domestic violence and abuse | publisher = Minnesota Center Against Violence and Abuse | location = St. Paul, Minnesota | date = 1997 | url = http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/rainbow/At%20The%20End%20Of%20The%20Rainbow.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 30 December 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080216045419/http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/rainbow/At%20The%20End%20Of%20The%20Rainbow.pdf | archivedate = 16 February 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies conducted by Emory University in 2014 identified 24 trigger for partner violence through web-based surveys, ranging from drugs and alcohol to safe-sex discussions.&lt;ref name="Finneran 2014"/&gt; A general theme of power and control seems to underlie abuse in both heterosexual and homosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Chen 2013"/&gt;

At the same time, significant differences, unique issues, and deceptive myths are typically present.&lt;ref name="Lehman 1997"/&gt; Lehman, regarding his 1997 survey, points to added discrimination and fears that gay and lesbian individuals may face. This includes potential dismissal by police and some social services, a lack of support from peers, fear of attracting negative stigma toward the [[gay community]], the impact of [[HIV/AIDS]] status in keeping partners together (due to health care insurance/access, or guilt), threat of [[outing]], and encountering supportive services that are targeted, or structured for the needs of heterosexual women, and may not meet the needs of gay men or lesbians. This service structure can make LGBTQ victims feel even more isolated and misunderstood than they may already because of their minority status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same-sex abuse|url=https://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=13586&amp;state_code=PG&amp;open_id=all|website=womenslaw.org|publisher=National Network to End Domestic Violence, Inc.|accessdate=24 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320065837/http://womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=13586&amp;state_code=PG&amp;open_id=all|archivedate=20 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lehman, however, stated that "due to the limited number of returned responses and non-random sampling methodology the findings of this work are not generalizable beyond the sample" of 32 initial respondents and final 10 who completed the more in-depth survey.&lt;ref name="Lehman 1997"/&gt; Particularly, sexual stressors and HIV/AIDS status have emerged as significant differences in same-sex partner violence.&lt;ref name="Finneran 2014"/&gt;

===Underreporting===
DV is among the most underreported crimes worldwide for both men and women.&lt;ref name="Cengage Learning"/&gt;&lt;ref name=concannon/&gt; A 2011 review article by intimate partner violence researcher Ko Ling Chan found men tended to under-report their own perpetration of domestic violence while women were more likely to under-report their victimization and over-estimate their own violence perpetration.&lt;ref name=chan2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Chan | first = Ko Ling | title = Gender symmetry in the self-reporting of intimate partner violence | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 263–286 | doi = 10.1177/0886260511416463 | pmid = 21920874 | date = January 2012 | url = http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134462/1/Content.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208152121/http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134462/1/Content.pdf | archivedate = 2015-12-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial or familial dependence, normalization of violence, and [[Self-blame|self-blaming]] were found to reduce the likelihood of self-reporting victimization in women. By contrast, fear and avoidance of legal consequences, the tendency to blame their partner, and a narrative focus on their own needs and emotions reduced the likelihood of self-reporting perpetration in men.&lt;ref name=chan2011/&gt;

A 2014 study conducted across the 28 member states of the [[European Union]] found that only 14% of women reported their most serious incident of intimate partner violence to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Facts and figures: ending violence against women | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures | website = unwomen.org | publisher = UN Women | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150827022736/http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures | archivedate = 27 August 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 report on DV in [[Northern Ireland]] found that "under-reporting is a concern and domestic abuse is the least likely of all violent crimes to be reported to the police".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Domestic call 'every 23 minutes' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7960591.stm | work = [[BBC news]] | publisher = BBC | location = Northern Ireland | date = 24 March 2009 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211064421/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7960591.stm | archivedate = 11 December 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men face additional gender related barriers in reporting, due to social stigmas regarding male victimization, and an increased likelihood of being overlooked by healthcare providers.&lt;ref name="Riviello 129"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finley 163"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Criminal Investigation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"/&gt;

===Social views===
[[File:Advertisement for Littleton Butter (31 December 1903).jpg|thumb|In this 1903 advertisement for Littleton Butter, domestic violence is portrayed as embarrassing but normal.]]

Social views on domestic violence vary from person to person, and from region to region, but in many places outside the West, the concept is very poorly understood. This is because in most of these countries the relation between the husband and wife is not considered one of equals, but instead one in which the wife must submit herself to the husband. This is codified in the laws of some countries – for example, in [[Yemen]], marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Amnesty International | author-link = Amnesty International | title = Yemen's dark side: discrimination and violence against women and girls | url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde31/014/2009/en/ | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | date = November 2009 | access-date = 11 April 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151210214138/https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde31/014/2009/en/ | archivedate = 10 December 2015 | df =  }} [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326165645/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf |date=2016-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Violence against Women in Families and Relationships'', "Globally, wife-beating is seen as justified in some circumstances by a majority of the population in various countries, most commonly in situations of actual or suspected infidelity by wives or their "disobedience" toward a husband or partner." &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | last2 = Pease | first2 = Robert | last3 = Taylor | first3 = Natalie | last4 = Webster | first4 = Kim | author-link = Michael Flood | contribution = Reshaping attitudes towards violence against women | editor-last1 = Buzawa | editor-first1 = Eve S. | editor-last2 = Stark | editor-first2 = Evan | title = Violence against women in families and relationships, Volume IV: the media and cultural attitudes | page = 184 | publisher = Praeger/ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780275998547}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=EE8dkgEACAAJ&amp;dq=Violence+against+women+9780275998547 Details.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110213354/https://books.google.com/books?id=EE8dkgEACAAJ&amp;dq=Violence+against+women+9780275998547 |date=2017-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These violent acts against a wife are often not considered a form of abuse by society (both men and women) but are considered to have been provoked by the behavior of the wife, who is seen as being at fault. While beatings of wives are often a response to "inappropriate" behaviors, in many places extreme acts such as [[honor killing]]s are approved by a high section of the society. In one survey, 33.4% of teenagers in  [[Jordan]]'s capital city, [[Amman]], approved of honor killings. This survey was carried in the capital of Jordan, which is much more liberal than other parts of the country; the researchers said that "We would expect that in the more rural and traditional parts of Jordan, support for honor killings would be even higher".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Maher |first=Ahmed |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22992365 |title=Many Jordan teenagers 'support honour killings' |work=[[BBC news]] |publisher=BBC |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=9 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921234334/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22992365 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 news story, ''The Washington Post'' reported, "The Reuters TrustLaw group named [[India]] one of the worst countries in the world for women this year, partly because domestic violence there is often seen as deserved. A 2012 report by UNICEF found that 57 percent of Indian boys and 53 percent of girls between the ages of 15 and 19 think wife-beating is justified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Khazan | first1 = Olga | last2 = Lakshmi | first2 = Rama | title = 10 reasons why India has a sexual violence problem | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/29/india-rape-victim-dies-sexual-violence-proble/ | work = [[The Washington Post]] | publisher = [[Jeff Bezos|Nash Holdings LLC]] | date = 29 December 2012 | access-date = 9 December 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150512153618/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/29/india-rape-victim-dies-sexual-violence-proble/ | archivedate = 12 May 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conservative cultures, a wife dressing in attire deemed insufficiently modest can suffer serious violence at the hands of her husband or relatives, with such violent responses seen as appropriate by most of the society: in a survey, 62.8% of women in [[Afghanistan]] said that a husband  is justified in beating his wife if she wears inappropriate clothes.&lt;ref name="cso.gov.af"&gt;[https://cso.gov.af/Content/files/AMICS.pdf Monitoring the Situation of Women &amp; Children.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205040032/http://cso.gov.af/Content/files/AMICS.pdf |date=2016-02-05 }} Afghanistan Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2010/2011.

According to [[Antonia Parvanova]], one of the difficulties of dealing legally with the issue of DV is that men in many male dominated societies do not understand that inflicting violence against their wives is against the law. She said, referring to a case that occurred in Bulgaria, "A husband was tried for severely beating his wife and when the judge asked him if he understood what he did and if he's sorry, the husband said "But she's my wife". He doesn't even understand that he has no right to beat her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Seven women die in EU each day due to domestic violence | url = http://www.novinite.com/articles/158764/Seven+Women+Die+in+EU+Each+Day+Due+to+Domestic+Violence | work = [[Novinite]] | publisher = One Click Media Group | location = Bulgaria | date = 8 March 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150405141612/http://www.novinite.com/articles/158764/Seven+Women+Die+in+EU+Each+Day+Due+to+Domestic+Violence | archivedate = 5 April 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNFPA]] writes that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UNFPA | author-link = United Nations Population Fund | title = Taking a stand against practices that harm women | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150404082023/http://web.lb.unfpa.org/gender/practices.htm | archive-date = 4 April 2015 | url = http://web.lb.unfpa.org/gender/practices.htm | publisher = United Nations Population Fund | date = April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
"In some developing countries, practices that subjugate and harm women – such as wife-beating, killings in the name of honour, female genital mutilation/cutting and dowry deaths – are condoned as being part of the natural order of things".

Strong views among the population in certain societies that reconciliation is more appropriate than punishment in cases of domestic violence are also another cause of legal impunity; a study found that 64% of public officials in Colombia said that if it were in their hands to solve a case of intimate partner violence, the action they would take would be to encourage the parties to reconcile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Álvarez | first = Camilo Segura | title = Colombia sigue legitimando la violencia contra la mujer | url = http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/colombia-sigue-legitimando-violencia-contra-mujer-articulo-547754 | work = [[El Espectador]] | publisher = [[Fidel Cano Correa]] | date = 5 March 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150510123028/http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/colombia-sigue-legitimando-violencia-contra-mujer-articulo-547754 | archivedate = 10 May 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victim blaming]] is also prevalent in many societies, including in Western countries: a 2010 [[Eurobarometer]] poll found that 52% of respondents agreed with the assertion that the "provocative behaviour of women" was a cause of violence against women; with  respondents in Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Slovenia being most likely to agree with the assertion (more than 70% in each of these countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = TNS | author-link = Taylor Nelson Sofres | contribution = Annexes: Tables: QC4.11 Please tell me whether you consider each of the following to be a cause of domestic violence against women, or not?: The provocative behaviour of women. | editor-last = TNS | editor-link = Taylor Nelson Sofres | title = Special Eurobarometer 344: Domestic violence against women | url = https://open-data.europa.eu/en/data/dataset/S816_73_2_EBS344 | publisher = [[European Commission]] | location = Brussels, Belgium | date = September 2010 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211000741/https://open-data.europa.eu/en/data/dataset/S816_73_2_EBS344 | archivedate = 2015-12-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===

===Custom and tradition===
[[File:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore, India]]]]
Local customs and traditions are often responsible for maintaining certain forms of DV. Such customs and traditions include son preference (the desire of a family to have a boy and not a girl, which is strongly prevalent in parts of Asia), which can lead to abuse and neglect of girl children by disappointed family members; child and forced marriages; [[dowry]]; the hierarchic [[caste]] system which stigmatizes "lower castes" and "untouchables", leading to discrimination and restricted opportunities of the females and thus making them more vulnerable to abuse; strict dress codes for women that may be enforced through violence by family members; strong requirement of female virginity before the wedding and violence related to non-conforming women and girls; taboos about [[menstruation]] leading to females being isolated and shunned during the time of menstruation; [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM); ideologies of marital 'conjugal rights' to sex which justify marital rape; the importance given to '[[family honor]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UNESCAP | author-link = United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific | title = Harmful traditional practices in three counties of South Asia: culture, human rights and violence against women | url = http://www.unescap.org/resources/harmful-traditional-practices-three-countries-south-asia-culture-human-rights-and-violence | publisher = [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] | date = November 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211144247/http://www.unescap.org/resources/harmful-traditional-practices-three-countries-south-asia-culture-human-rights-and-violence | archivedate = 2015-12-11 | df =  }} Gender and Development Discussion Paper Series No. 21.

According to a 2003 report by Human Rights Watch, "Customs such as the payment of '[[bride price]]' (payment made by a man to the family of a woman he wishes to marry), whereby a man essentially purchases  his wife’s sexual favors and reproductive capacity, underscore men’s socially sanctioned entitlement to dictate the terms of sex, and to use force to do so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Human Rights Watch | author-link = Human Rights Watch | title = Policy paralysis: a call for action on HIV/AIDS-related human rights abuses against women and girls in Africa | url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/africa1203/africa1203.pdf | publisher = Human Rights Watch | date = December 2003 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160311131419/https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/africa1203/africa1203.pdf | archivedate = 2016-03-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organization has stated that women in abusive relations are at significantly higher risk of HIV/AIDS. WHO states that women in violent relations have difficulty negotiating [[safer sex]] with their partners, are often forced to have sex, and find it difficult to ask for appropriate testing when they think they may be infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Violence against women and HIV/AIDS: critical intersections: intimate partner violence and HIV/AIDS | publisher = World Health Organization | location = Geneva, Switzerland | url = http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/pht/InfoBulletinIntimatePartnerViolenceFinal.pdf | series = Information Bulletin Series | id = Bulletin no. 1 | date = November 2004 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131025220637/http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/pht/InfoBulletinIntimatePartnerViolenceFinal.pdf | archivedate = 2013-10-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade of cross-sectional research from Rwanda, Tanzania, South Africa, and India, has consistently found women who have experienced partner violence to be more likely to be infected with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Facts and figures: ending violence against women | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures#notes | website = unwomen.org | publisher = UN Women | date = October 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150827022736/http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures#notes | archivedate = 2015-08-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO stated that:&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a compelling case to end intimate partner violence both in its own right as well as to reduce women and girls vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. The evidence on the linkages between violence against women and HIV/AIDS highlights that there are direct and indirect mechanisms by which the two interact.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Same-sex relationships are similarly affected by HIV/AIDS status in domestic violence. Research by Heintz and Melendez found that same-sex individuals may have difficulty breaching the topic of safe-sex for reasons such as "decreased perception of control over sex, fear of violence, and unequal power distributions..."&lt;ref name="Heintz 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Heintz | first1 = Adam J. | last2 = Melendez | first2 = Rita M. | title = Intimate partner violence and HIV/STD risk among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–208 | doi = 10.1177/0886260505282104 | pmid = 16368761 | date = February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those who reported violence in the study, about 50% reported forced sexual experiences, of which only half reported the use of safe sex measures. Barriers to safer-sex included fear of abuse, and deception in safe-sex practices. Heintz and Melendez's research ultimately concluded that sexual assault/abuse in same-sex relationships provides a major concern for HIV/AIDS infection as it decreases instances of safe-sex. Furthermore, these incidents create additional fear and stigma surrounding safe-sex conversations and knowing ones STD status.&lt;ref name="Heintz 2006"/&gt;

===Legislation===
Lack of adequate legislation which criminalizes domestic violence, or, alternatively legislation which prohibits consensual behaviors, may hinder the progress in regard to reducing the incidence of DV. Amnesty International’s Secretary General has stated that: "It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity – even punishable by death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Amnesty International | author-link = Amnesty International | title = Women and girls: sexual and reproductive rights under threat worldwide | url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/sexual-and-reproductive-rights-under-threat-worldwide-2014-03-06 | website = amnesty.org | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | date = 6 March 2014 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141206225115/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/sexual-and-reproductive-rights-under-threat-worldwide-2014-03-06 | archivedate = 6 December 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to WHO, "one of the most common forms of violence against women is that performed by a husband or male partner." The WHO notes that such violence is often ignored because often "legal systems and cultural norms do not treat as a crime, but rather as a 'private' family matter, or a normal part of life."&lt;ref name="who.intB"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Gender, equity, human rights: gender based violence | publisher = World Health Organization | location = Geneva, Switzerland | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150423143519/http://www.who.int/gender/violence/gbv/en/ | archive-date = 23 April 2015 | url = http://www.who.int/gender/violence/gbv/en/ | accessdate = 22 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminalization of [[adultery]] has been cited as inciting violence against women, as these prohibitions are often meant, in law or in practice, to control women's and not men's behavior; and are used to rationalize acts of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = OHCHR | author-link = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights | title = Statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice | url = http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12672 | publisher = [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | date = 18 October 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140426235132/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12672 | archivedate = 26 April 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Decriminalization of adultery and defenses | url = http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/738-decriminalization-of-adultery-and-defenses.html%29 | website = endvawnow.org | publisher = Virtual Knowledge Centre to End Violence Against Women and Girls, UN Women | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160108112544/http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/738-decriminalization-of-adultery-and-defenses.html%29 | archivedate = 8 January 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Navi Pillay]]: "Some have argued, and continue to argue, that family violence is placed outside the conceptual framework of international human rights. However, under international laws and standards, there is a clear State responsibility to uphold women’s rights and ensure freedom from discrimination, which includes the responsibility to prevent, protect and provide redress – regardless of sex, and regardless of a person’s status in the family."&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite book | last = OHCHR | author-link = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights | title = High Commissioner speaks out against domestic violence and "honour killing" on occasion of International Women's Day | url = http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9869&amp;LangID=E | publisher = [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | date = 8 March 2010 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714182718/http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9869&amp;LangID=E | archivedate = 14 July 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ability to leave===
The ability of victims of domestic violence to leave the relationship is crucial for preventing further abuse. In traditional communities, divorced women often feel rejected and ostracized. In order to avoid this stigma, many women prefer to remain in the marriage and endure the abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Fields | first = Rona | contribution = The Negev Bedouin: a contemporary remnant of ancient tribal society | editor-last = Fields | editor-first = Rona | title = Against violence against women: the case for gender as a protected class | pages = 63–64 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Basingstoke | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781137439178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she separates from her husband or when he dies, she risks losing her home, land, household goods and other property. Failure to ensure equal property rights upon separation or divorce discourages women from leaving violent marriages, as women may be forced to choose between violence at home and destitution in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Manjoo | first = Rashida | author-link = Rashida Manjoo | title = Statement by Ms. Rashida Manjoo, Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its cause and consequences | url = https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/csw56/statements/statement-spec-rap-manjoo.pdf | publisher = UN Women | location = New York | date = February 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170318105200/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/csw56/statements/statement-spec-rap-manjoo.pdf | archivedate = 2017-03-18 | df =  }} [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women#Session reports|CSW56]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The legal inability to obtain a divorce is also a factor in the proliferation of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Conway-Turner | first1 = Kate | last2 = Cherrin | first2 = Suzanne | contribution = Sexual harassment: can women be comfortable in the public world? | editor-last1 = Conway-Turner | editor-first1 = Kate | editor-last2 = Cherrin | editor-first2 = Suzanne | title = Women, families, and feminist politics: a global exploration | page = 198 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | location = Oxford New York | isbn = 9781560239352| date = 1998-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures where [[arranged marriage|marriages are arranged]] between families, a woman who attempts a separation or divorce without the consent of her husband and extended family or relatives may risk being subjected to "honor"- based violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Mayell | first = Hillary | title = Thousands of women killed for family "honor" | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html | work = [[National Geographic News]] | publisher = [[National Geographic Society]] | date = 12 February 2002 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151019011522/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html | archivedate = 19 October 2015 | df =  }} [http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/212/readings/honor-kil-ng.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129092131/http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/212/readings/honor-kil-ng.pdf |date=2015-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hbv-awareness.com"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = FAQ: frequently asked questions about honour based violence (HBV) and honour killings | url = http://hbv-awareness.com/faq/ | website = hbv-awareness.com | publisher = [[Deeyah Khan#Honour Based Violence Awareness (HBVA)|Honour Based Violence Awareness (HBVA)]] | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150815114026/http://hbv-awareness.com/faq/ | archivedate = 15 August 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of [[bride price]] also makes leaving a marriage more difficult: if a wife want to leave, the husband may demand back the bride price from her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Protecting the girl child: using the law to end child, early and forced marriage and related human rights violations | url = http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf | publisher = [[Equality Now]] | date = January 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150528120452/http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf | archivedate = 2015-05-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lelieveld | first = Marlijn | title = Child protection in the Somali region of Ethiopia | url = http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/FINALChild_Protection_in_the_Somali_Region_30511.pdf | publisher = [[Save the Children]] | date = April 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095119/http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/FINALChild_Protection_in_the_Somali_Region_30511.pdf | archivedate = 2015-09-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Stange | first1 = Mary Z. | last2 = Oyster | first2 = Carol K. | last3 = Sloan | first3 = Jane E. | contribution = Equatorial Guinea | editor-last1 = Stange | editor-first1 = Mary Z. | editor-last2 = Oyster | editor-first2 = Carol K. | editor-last3 = Sloan | editor-first3 = Jane E. | title = Encyclopedia of women in today's world, volume 1 | page = 496 | publisher = Sage Reference | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781412976855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In advanced nations like the [[United Kingdom]] domestic violence victims may have difficulties getting alternative housing which can force them to stay in the abusive relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41803342 The domestic violence victims 'left begging for a home'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031124354/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41803342 |date=2017-10-31 }} ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Many domestic violence victims delay leaving the abuser because they have pets and are afraid of what will happen to the pets if they leave.  Safehouses need to be more accepting of pets, many refuse to accept pets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-46404837/the-safehouse-for-women-and-pets-to-flee-abuse The safehouse for women and pets to flee abuse] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual versus family unit rights===
The way the individual rights of a family member versus the rights of the family as a unit are balanced vary significantly in different societies. This may influence the degree to which a government may be willing to investigate family incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Human Rights Watch | author-link = Human Rights Watch | title = Uzbekistan: Sacrificing women to save the family? Domestic violence in Uzbekistan | url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/uzbekistan/uzbek0701.pdf | website = hrw.org | publisher = Human Rights Watch | date = July 2001 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205035651/https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/uzbekistan/uzbek0701.pdf | archivedate = 5 February 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, individual members of the family are expected to sacrifice almost completely their own interests in favor of the interests of the family as a whole. What is viewed as an undue expression of personal autonomy is condemned as unacceptable. In these cultures the family predominates over the individual, and where this interacts with [[family honor|cultures of honor]], individualistic choice that may damage the family reputation in the community may result in extreme punishment, such as honor killings.&lt;ref name="hbv-awareness.com"/&gt;

===Immigration policies===
In some countries, the [[immigration policy]] is tied to whether the person desiring citizenship is married to his/her sponsor. This can lead to persons  being trapped in violent relations – such persons may risk deportation if they attempt to separate (they may be accused of having entered into a [[sham marriage]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Douglas | first1 = Debbie | last2 = Go | first2 = Avvy | last3 = Blackstock | first3 = Sarah | title = Editorial opinion: Canadian immigration changes force women to stay with sponsoring spouse for two years | url = https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2012/12/05/canadian_immigration_changes_force_women_to_stay_with_sponsoring_spouse_for_two_years.html | work = [[Toronto Star|The Star]] | publisher = [[Star Media Group]], [[Torstar|Torstar Corporation]] | location = Toronto, Canada | date = 5 December 2012 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150904192500/http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2012/12/05/canadian_immigration_changes_force_women_to_stay_with_sponsoring_spouse_for_two_years.html | archivedate = 4 September 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Domestic violence victims must not be trapped by deportation fears | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006110720/http://www.immigrantcouncil.ie/research-publications/publications/694-domestic-violence-victims-must-not-be-trapped-by-deportation-fears | archive-date = 6 October 2014 | url = http://www.immigrantcouncil.ie/research-publications/publications/694-domestic-violence-victims-must-not-be-trapped-by-deportation-fears | website = immigrantcouncil.ie | publisher = The Immigrant Council of Ireland (ICI) | date = May 2013 }} [http://immigrantcouncil.ie/files/publications/1a2d6-briefing_document_dv_-_longer_version_-_final_2013.pdf Briefing document by the Domestic Violence Coalition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424204545/http://immigrantcouncil.ie/files/publications/1a2d6-briefing_document_dv_-_longer_version_-_final_2013.pdf |date=2016-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = AFP in Sydney | title = Australian migrants trapped in 'slave-like' marriages | url = https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/01/australian-migrants-slave-marriages | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 1 August 2014 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151011091736/http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/01/australian-migrants-slave-marriages | archivedate = 11 October 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Lyneham | first1 = Samantha | last2 = Richards | first2 = Kelly | title = Human trafficking involving marriage and partner migration to Australia | publisher = Australian Institute of Criminology | location = Canberra, Australia | series = Research and Public Policy Series | id = Paper no. 124 | url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/72187/3/72187.pdf | format = PDF | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205034638/http://eprints.qut.edu.au/72187/3/72187.pdf | archivedate = 2016-02-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the women come from cultures where they will suffer disgrace from their families if they abandon their marriage and return home, and so they prefer to stay married, therefore remaining locked in a cycle of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Raza | first = Nusrat | title = Visa for hell | year = 2011 | publisher = Best Books Publications | location = Lahore | oclc = 772450148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigrant communities===
Domestic violence may happen in immigrant communities, and often there is little awareness in these communities of the laws and policies of the host country. A study among first generation South Asians in the UK found that they had little knowledge about what constituted criminal behavior under the English law. The researchers found that "There was certainly no awareness that there could be rape within a marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = McVeigh | first = Tracy | title = Abuse going unreported in Britain’s south Asian communities – study | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/19/abuse-going-unreported-in-britains-south-asian-communities-study | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 19 September 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160812152918/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/19/abuse-going-unreported-in-britains-south-asian-communities-study | archivedate = 12 August 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cowburn | first1 = Malcolm | last2 = Gill | first2 = Aisha K. | last3 = Harrison | first3 = Karen | title = Speaking about sexual abuse in British South Asian communities: offenders, victims and the challenges of shame and reintegration | journal = Journal of Sexual Aggression, Special Issue: Community Reintegration of Sexual Offenders | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–15 | doi = 10.1080/13552600.2014.929188 | date = January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in Australia showed that among the immigrant women sampled who were abused by partners and did not report it, 16.7% did not know DV was illegal, while 18.8% did not know that they could get protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Satyen | first1 = Lata | last2 = Ranganathan | first2 = Archna | last3 = Piedra | first3 = Steve | last4 = Simon | first4 = Ben | last5 = Kocsic | first5 = Jessica | title = Family violence in migrant women in Australia: strategies for migrant men to reduce the violence | date = May 2013 }} Conference paper for the White Ribbon International Conference, Sydney, Australia, 13–15 May 2013.

==Causes==
Of the most important factors in domestic violence is a belief that abuse, whether physical or verbal, is acceptable. Other factors include [[substance abuse]], [[unemployment]], mental health problems, lack of coping skills, isolation, and excessive dependence on the abuser.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 11"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Willis C. | last2 = Newman | first2 = Esmeralda | contribution = What is domestic violence?

===Cycles of violence===

====Cycle of abuse====
[[Lenore E. Walker]] presented the model of a [[cycle of abuse]] which consists of four phases. First, there is a buildup to abuse when tension rises until a domestic violence incident ensues. During the reconciliation stage, the abuser may be kind and loving and then there is a period of calm. When the situation is calm, the abused person may be hopeful that the situation will change.

====Intergenerational violence====
A common aspect among abusers is that they witnessed abuse in their childhood, in other words they were participants in a chain of [[Cycle of violence|intergenerational cycles of domestic violence]].&lt;ref name=Danieli&gt;{{citation | last1 = Simons | first1 = Ronald L. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Christine | contribution = An examination of competing explanations for the intergenerational transmission of domestic violence | editor-last = Danieli | editor-first = Yael | title = International handbook of multigenerational legacies of trauma | pages = 553–570 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Plenum Press]] | location = New York London | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780306457388 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=thoNwuDmHEQC&amp;pg=PA553 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140704165827/http://books.google.com/books?id=thoNwuDmHEQC&amp;pg=PA553 | archivedate = 2014-07-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; That does not mean, conversely, that if a child witnesses or is subject to violence that they will become abusers.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 11" /&gt; Understanding and breaking the intergenerational abuse patterns may do more to reduce domestic violence than other remedies for managing the abuse.&lt;ref name=Danieli /&gt;

Responses that focus on children suggest that experiences throughout life influence an individual’s propensity to engage in family violence (either as a victim or as a perpetrator). Researchers supporting this theory suggest it is useful to think of three sources of domestic violence: childhood socialization, previous experiences in couple relationships during adolescence, and levels of strain in a person's current life. People who observe their parents abusing each other, or who were themselves abused may incorporate abuse into their behaviour within relationships that they establish as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = Debra | last2 = Seltzer | first2 = Judith A. | title = The effect of family structure on family violence: the case of remarriage | location = Durham, New Hampshire | year = 1984 }} Paper presented at the Second National Conference for Family Violence Researchers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kalmuss | first = Debra | title = The intergenerational transmission of marital aggression | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–19 | doi = 10.2307/351858 | jstor = 351858 | date = February 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = Debra | last2 = Seltzer | first2 = Judith A. | title = Continuity of marital behavior in remarriage: the case of spouse abuse | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–120 | doi = 10.2307/352234 | jstor = 352234 | date = February 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that the more children are [[corporal punishment|physically punished]], the more likely they will be as adults to act violently towards family members, including intimate partners.&lt;ref name="Gershoff 2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gershoff, E.T. |date=2008 |title=Report on Physical Punishment in the United States: What Research Tells Us About Its Effects on Children |format=PDF |location=Columbus, OH |publisher=Center for Effective Discipline |page=16 |url=http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127213730/http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-27 |df= |access-date=2015-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children who are [[spank]]ed more as children are more likely as adults to approve of hitting a partner, and also experience more marital conflict and feelings of anger in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health|title=Guidance for effective discipline |journal=Pediatrics |volume=101 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=723–8 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9521967}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have found physical punishment to be associated with "higher levels of aggression against parents, siblings, peers and spouses", even when controlling for other factors.&lt;ref name="Durrant &amp; Ensom"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Durrant |first=Joan |last2=Ensom |first2=Ron |date=4 September 2012 |title=Physical punishment of children: lessons from 20 years of research |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=184 |issue=12 |pages=1373–1377 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.101314 |pmid=22311946 |pmc=3447048}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these associations do not prove a [[causation (sociology)|causal]] relationship, a number of [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] suggest that the experience of physical punishment does have a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors.

In some  [[patrilineal]] societies around the world, a young bride moves with the family of her husband. As a new girl in the home, she starts as having the lowest (or among the lowest) position in the family, and is often subjected to violence and abuse, and is, in particular, strongly controlled by the parents-in-law: with the arrival of the daughter-in-law in the family, the mother-in-law's status is elevated and she now has (often for the first time in her life) substantial power over someone else, and "This family system itself tends to produce a cycle of violence in which the formerly abused bride becomes the abusing mother-in-law to her new daughter-in-law".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ruether | first = Rosemary Radford | contribution = The greening of world religions | editor-last = Ruether | editor-first = Rosemary Radford | title = Integrating ecofeminism, globalization, and world religions | page = 50 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham, Maryland | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780742535305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International writes that, in [[Tajikistan]], "it is almost an initiation ritual for the mother-in-law to put her daughter-in-law through the same torments she went through herself as a young wife."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Amnesty International | author-link = Amnesty International | title = Violence is not just a family affair: women face abuse in Tajikistan | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | id = Paper no.

Personality traits include sudden bursts of [[anger]], poor [[impulse control]], and poor [[self-esteem]]. Various theories suggest that psychopathology is a factor, and that abuse experienced as a child leads some people to be more violent as adults. Correlation has been found between [[juvenile delinquency]] and domestic violence in adulthood.&lt;ref name=Kalra&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=M.A.|first=Michelle|last=Kalra|title=Juvenile delinquency and adult aggression against women|url=http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/570/|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University|date=1996|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502151157/http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/570/|archivedate=2012-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutton has suggested a psychological profile of men who abuse their wives, arguing that they have [[borderline personality disorder|borderline personalities]] that are developed early in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dutton, Donald G.  |author2=Golant, Susan | title = The batterer: a psychological profile | publisher = Basic Books | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780465033881 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dutton | first1 = Donald G. | last2 = Starzomski | first2 = Andrew J. | title = Borderline personality in perpetrators of psychological and physical abuse | journal = Violence &amp; Victims | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 326–337 | pmid = 8060906 | date = Winter 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these psychological theories are disputed: Gelles suggests that psychological theories are limited, and points out that other researchers have found that only 10% (or less) fit this psychological profile.

An [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychological]] explanation of domestic violence is that it represents male attempts to control female reproduction and ensure sexual exclusivity.&lt;ref name=Jealousy2&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Goetz | first = Aaron T. | title = The evolutionary psychology of violence | journal = Psicothema | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | pmid = 20100422 | date = 2010 | url = http://www.psicothema.com/english/psicothema.asp?id=3690 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222130253/http://www.psicothema.com/english/psicothema.asp?id=3690 | archivedate = 2015-12-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence related to extramarital relations is seen as justified in certain parts of the world. For instance, a survey in [[Diyarbakir]], [[Turkey]], found that, when asked the appropriate punishment for a woman who has committed [[adultery]], 37% of respondents said she should be killed, while 21% said her nose or ears should be cut off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Rainsford | first = Sarah | title = 'Honour' crime defiance in Turkey | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4357158.stm | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher = BBC | date = 19 October 2005 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150115054818/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4357158.stm | archivedate = 15 January 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar feelings may at times be generated in a situations where one partner is more financially successful.&lt;ref name=Jealousy2/&gt;

===Social theories===

====General====
Social theories look at external factors in the offender's environment, such as family structure, stress, social learning, and includes [[rational choice theory (criminology)|rational choice]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Haugan | first1 = Grethemor Skagseth | last2 = Nøttestad | first2 = Jim Aage | title = Norway: treatment program for men who batters | url = http://www.europrofem.org/contri/2_04_en/en-viol/81en_vio.htm | publisher = Violence in intimate relationships Norway: EuroPROFEM – The European Men Profeminist Network, [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] | location = Trondheim, Norway | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726042139/http://www.europrofem.org/contri/2_04_en/en-viol/81en_vio.htm | archivedate = 2011-07-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social learning theory]] suggests that people learn from observing and modeling after others' behavior. With [[positive reinforcement]], the behavior continues. If one observes violent behavior, one is more likely to imitate it. If there are no negative consequences (e. g. victim accepts the violence, with submission), then the behavior will likely continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hotaling | first1 = Gerald T. | last2 = Sugarman | first2 = David B. | title = An analysis of risk markers in husband to wife violence: the current state of knowledge | journal = Violence &amp; Victims | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–124 | pmid = 3154143 | date = 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = Christopher M. | last2 = Meyer | first2 = Shannon-Lee | last3 = O'Leary | first3 = K.

Resource theory was suggested by William Goode (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Goode | first = William J. | title = Force and violence in the family | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 624–636 | doi = 10.2307/349435 | jstor = 349435 | date = November 1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who are most dependent on the spouse for economic well being (e.g. homemakers/housewives, women with handicaps, the unemployed), and are the primary caregiver to their children, fear the increased financial burden if they leave their marriage. Dependency means that they have fewer options and few resources to help them cope with or change their spouse's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = Debra S. | last2 = Straus | first2 = Murray A. | author-link2 = Murray A.

Couples that share power equally experience lower incidence of conflict, and when conflict does arise, are less likely to resort to violence. If one spouse desires control and power in the relationship, the spouse may resort to abuse&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Kurz | first = Demie | contribution = Battering and the criminal justice system: a feminist view | editor-last1 = Buzawa | editor-first1 = Eva Schlesinger | editor-last2 = Buzawa | editor-first2 = Carl G. | title = Domestic violence: the changing criminal justice response | pages = 21–40 | publisher = Auburn House | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780865690011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may include coercion and threats, intimidation, emotional abuse, economic abuse, isolation, [[making light of]] the situation and blaming the spouse, using children (threatening to take them away), and behaving as "master of the castle".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Wallace | first = Harvey | contribution = Spousal abuse | editor-last = Wallace | editor-first = Harvey | title = Family violence: legal, medical, and social perspectives | pages = 184–185 | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780205418220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Power and control wheel | url = http://www.theduluthmodel.org/documents/PhyVio.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100601232757/http://www.theduluthmodel.org/documents/PhyVio.pdf | archivedate = 1 June 2010 | publisher = Domestic Abuse Intervention Project | accessdate= 27 November 2007 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social stress====

Stress may be increased when a person is living in a family situation, with increased pressures. Social stresses, due to inadequate finances or other such problems in a family may further increase tensions.&lt;ref name="gelles"/&gt; Violence is not always caused by stress, but may be one way that some people respond to stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = Debra | last2 = Seltzer | first2 = Judith A. | title = Socialization and stress explanations for spouse abuse | journal = [[Social Forces]] | volume = 67 | issue = 2 | pages = 473–491 | doi = 10.2307/2579191 | jstor = 2579191 | date = December 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aneshensel | first = Carol S.  | title = Social stress: theory and research | journal = [[Annual Review of Sociology]] | volume = 18 | pages = 15–38 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.so.18.080192.000311 | date = August 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Families and couples in poverty may be more likely to experience domestic violence, due to increased stress and conflicts about finances and other aspects.&lt;ref name="jewkes2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jewkes | first = Rachel | title = Intimate partner violence: causes and prevention | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 359 | issue = 9315 | pages = 1423–1429 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08357-5 | jstor = 11978358 | date = 20 April 2002 | pmid=11978358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speculate that poverty may hinder a man's ability to live up to his idea of "successful manhood", thus he fears losing honor and respect. Theory suggests that when he is unable to economically support his wife, and maintain control, he may turn to [[misogyny]], [[substance abuse]], and [[crime]] as ways to express masculinity.&lt;ref name="jewkes2002" /&gt;

Same-sex relationships may experience similar social stressors. Additionally, violence in same-sex relationships has been linked to internalized homophobia, which contributed to low self-esteem and anger in both perpetrator and victim.&lt;ref name="Murray 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murray | first1 = Christine E. | last2 = Mobley | first2 = A. Keith | last3 = Buford | first3 = Anne P. | last4 = Seaman-DeJohn | first4 = Megan M. | title = Same-sex Intimate partner violence: dynamics, social context, and counseling implications | journal = Journal of LGBT Issues in Counseling | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 7–30 | doi = 10.1300/J462v01n04_03 | date = January 2007 | url = https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/AK_Mobley_Same_2007.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205035411/https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/AK_Mobley_Same_2007.pdf | archivedate = 2016-02-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internalized homophobia also appears to be a barrier in victims seeking help. Similarly, [[heterosexism]] can play a key role in domestic violence in the LGBT community. As a social ideology that implies "heterosexuality is normative, morally superior, and better than [homosexuality],"&lt;ref name="Murray 2006"/&gt; heterosexism can hinder services and lead to an unhealthy self-image in sexual minorities. Heterosexism in legal and medical institutions can be seen in instances of discrimination, biases, and insensitivity toward sexual orientation. For example, as of 2006, seven states explicitly denied LGBT individuals the  ability to apply for protective orders,&lt;ref name="Murray 2006"/&gt; proliferating ideas of LGBT subjugation, which is tied to feelings of anger and powerlessness.

====Power and control====

[[File:(2) Cycle of abuse, power &amp; control issues in domestic abuse situations.gif|thumb|Cycle of abuse, power &amp; control issues in domestic abuse situations (double click to enlarge)]]
[[Power (social and political)|Power]] and control in abusive relationships is the way that abusers exert physical, sexual and other forms of abuse to gain control within relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Violence wheel | url = http://www.domesticviolence.org/violence-wheel/ | publisher = Domestic Abuse Violence Project (aka [[Duluth Model]]) | access-date = 18 April 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140223092347/http://www.domesticviolence.org/violence-wheel | archivedate = 23 February 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[causality|causalist]] view of domestic violence is that it is a strategy to gain or maintain power and control over the victim. This view is in alignment with Bancroft's "cost-benefit" theory that abuse rewards the perpetrator in ways other than, or in addition to, simply exercising power over his or her target(s). He cites evidence in support of his argument that, in most cases, abusers are quite capable of exercising control over themselves, but choose not to do so for various reasons.&lt;ref name=Bancroft&gt;{{cite book | last = Bancroft | first = Lundy | title = Why does he do that?: Inside the minds of angry and controlling men | publisher = [[Berkley Books]] | location = New York, New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780425191651 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=xEZIpu3SVvcC Details.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101115109/https://books.google.com/books?id=xEZIpu3SVvcC |date=2015-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, one person seeks complete power and control over their partner and uses different ways to achieve this, including resorting to physical violence.

Questions of power and control are integral to the widely utilized [[Duluth Domestic Abuse Intervention Project]]. They developed a "Power and Control Wheel" to illustrate this: it has power and control at the center, surrounded by spokes (techniques used), the titles of which include: coercion and [[threat]]s, [[intimidation]], [[emotional abuse]], [[solitude|isolation]], [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimizing]], [[denial|denying]] and blaming, using children, economic abuse, and privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Power and control wheel | url = http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Power_and_Control_wheel_NCDSV.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence | access-date = 18 November 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150314062136/http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Power_and_Control_wheel_NCDSV.pdf | archivedate = 14 March 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonsubordination theory ===
Nonsubordination theory, sometimes called dominance theory, is an area of [[feminist legal theory]] that focuses on the power differential between men and women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonsubordination theory takes the position that society, and more especially men in society, use sex differences between men and women to perpetuate this power imbalance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Unlike other topics within [[feminist legal theory]], nonsubordination theory focuses specifically on certain sexual behaviors, including control of women’s [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[sexual harassment]], pornography, and violence against women generally.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that nonsubordination theory best addresses these particular issues because they affect “almost exclusively” women.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 332 citing MacKinnon, Catharine A. (1987) ''Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law''. Harvard University Press. pp. 40–41. {{ISBN|0674298748}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  MacKinnon advocates for nonsubordination theory over other theories, like formal equality, substantive equality, and difference theory, because [[sexual violence]] and other forms of [[violence against women]] are not a question of “sameness and difference,” but rather are best viewed as “more central inequalities” for women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Though nonsubordination theory has been discussed at great length in evaluating various forms of [[sexual violence]] against women, it also serves as a basis for understanding domestic violence and why it occurs.  Nonsubordination theory tackles the issue of domestic violence as a subset of the broader problem of [[violence against women]] because domestic violence victims are overwhelmingly female.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 387 citing Rennison, Callie Marie and Welchans, Sarah (May 2000) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090901024747/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov//bjs//pub/pdf/ipv.pdf ''Special Report: Intimate Partner Violence''], Bureau of Justice Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of nonsubordination theory propose several reasons why it works best to explain domestic violence.  First, there are certain recurring patterns in domestic violence that indicate it is not the result of intense anger or arguments, but rather is a form of subordination.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], pp. 389–92 citing Fischer, Karla et al. (1993) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37810125_The_Culture_of_Battering_and_the_Role_of_Mediation_in_Domestic_Violence_Cases ''The Culture of Battering and the Role of Mediation in Domestic Violence Cases''], 46 SMU L. Rev. pp. 2117, 2121–2130, 2133, 2136–2138, 2141.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is evidenced in part by the fact that domestic violence victims are typically abused in a variety of situations and by a variety of means.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  For example, victims are sometimes beaten after they have been sleeping or have been separated from the batterer, and often the abuse takes on a financial or emotional form in addition to physical abuse.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Supporters of nonsubordination theory use these examples to dispel the notion that battering is always the result of heat of the moment anger or intense arguments.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Also, batterers often employ manipulative and deliberate tactics when abusing their victims, which can “rang[e] from searching for and destroying a treasured object of hers to striking her in areas of her body that do not show bruises (e.g. her scalp) or in areas where she would be embarrassed to show others her bruises.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  These behaviors can be even more useful to a batterer when the batterer and the victim share children, because the batterer often controls the family’s financial assets, making the victim less likely to leave if it would put her children at risk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Martha Mahoney, of the [[University of Miami School of Law]], also points to the notion of “separation assault”—a phenomenon where a batterer further assaults a victim who is attempting or has attempted to leave an abusive relationship—as additional evidence that domestic violence is used to subordinate victims to their batterers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], pp. 392–93 citing {{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1289533 |jstor=1289533 |title=Legal Images of Battered Women: Redefining the Issue of Separation |journal=Michigan Law Review |volume=90 |pages=1 |year=1991 |last1=Mahoney |first1=Martha R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A batterer’s unwillingness to allow the victim to leave the relationship substantiates the idea that violence is being used to force the victim to continue to fulfill the batterer’s wishes that she obey him.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Nonsubordination theorists argue that all of these actions—the variety of abusive behaviors and settings, exploiting the victim’s children, and assault upon separation—suggest a larger problem than merely an inability to properly manage anger, though anger may be a byproduct of these behaviors.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The purpose of these actions is to keep the victim, and sometimes the entire family, subordinate to the batterer, according to nonsubordination theory.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A second rationale for using nonsubordination theory to explain domestic violence, beyond the variety of tactics used by abusers, is that the frequency with which domestic violence occurs overpowers the idea that it is merely the result of a batterer’s anger.  Professor Mahoney explains that because of the [[sensationalism]] generated in media coverage of “big” or particularly horrific domestic violence cases, it is difficult for people to conceptualize how frequently domestic violence happens in society.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  However, domestic violence is a regular occurrence experienced by up to one half of people in the United States, and an overwhelming number of victims are female.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The sheer number of domestic violence victims in the United States suggests that domestic violence is not merely the result of intimate partners who cannot control their anger.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Nonsubordination theory contends that it is the batterer’s desire to subordinate the victim, not his uncontainable anger, which explains the frequency of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Nonsubordination theorists argue that other forms of [[feminist legal theory]] do not offer any explanation for the phenomenon of domestic violence generally or the frequency with which it occurs.

Critics of nonsubordination theory complain that it offers no solutions to the problems it points out.  For example, proponents of nonsubordination theory criticize certain approaches that have been taken to address domestic violence in the legal system, such as mandatory arrest or prosecution policies.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;  These policies take discretion away from [[law enforcement]] by forcing police officers to arrest suspected domestic violence offenders and prosecutors to prosecute those cases.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There is a lot of discourse surrounding mandatory arrest. Opponents argue that it undermines a victim's autonomy, discourages the empowerment of women by discounting other resources available and puts victims at more risk for domestic abuse. States that have implemented mandatory arrest laws have 60% higher homicide rates which have been shown to be consistent with the decline in reporting rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavlidakis|first=Alexandra|date=January 1, 2009|title=Mandatory Arrest: Past Its Prime|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&amp;context=lawreview|journal=Santa Clara Law Review|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604135236/http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&amp;context=lawreview|archivedate=June 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of these policies contend that the criminal justice system is sometimes the only way to reach victims of domestic violence, and that if an offender knows he will be arrested, it will [[Deterrence (legal)|deter]] future domestic violence conduct.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  People who endorse nonsubordination theory argue that these policies only serve to further subordinate women by forcing them to take a certain course of action, thus compounding the trauma they experienced during the abuse.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  However, nonsubordination theory itself offers no better or more appropriate solutions, which is why some scholars argue that other forms of [[feminist legal theory]] are more appropriate to address issues of domestic and [[sexual violence]]. Sociologist Andrew Glover critiques non-subordination theory on the grounds that domestic violence occurs among homosexual couples at the same rate as heterosexual couples. So it cannot be caused by, or exist to perpetuate, power differentials between the sexes. &lt;ref&gt; Glover, Andrew. "Beware of Root Causes."

===Psychological===
Among victims who are still living with their perpetrators high amounts of stress, fear, and anxiety are commonly reported. [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is also common, as victims are made to feel [[guilt (emotion)|guilty]] for ‘provoking’ the abuse and are frequently subjected to intense [[criticism]]. It is reported that 60% of victims meet the [[Rating scales for depression|diagnostic criteria for depression]], either during or after termination of the relationship, and have a greatly increased risk of suicide. Those who are battered either emotionally or physically often are also depressed because of a feeling of worthlessness. These feelings often persist long-term and it is suggested that many receive therapy for it because of the heightened risk of suicide and other traumatic symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Barnett | first = Ola W. | title = Why battered women do not leave, part 2: external inhibiting factors — social support and internal inhibiting factors | journal = [[Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse]] | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–35 | doi = 10.1177/1524838001002001001 | date = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to depression, victims of domestic violence also commonly experience long-term [[anxiety]] and [[panic]], and are likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder]] and [[Panic Disorder]]. The most commonly referenced psychological effect of domestic violence is [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD). PTSD (as experienced by victims) is characterized by [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]], intrusive images, exaggerated [[startle response]], [[nightmares]], and avoidance of triggers that are associated with the abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vitanza | first1 = Stephanie | last2 = Vogel | first2 = Laura C.M. | last3 = Marshall | first3 = Linda L. | title = Distress and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in abused women | journal = Violence &amp; Victims | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–34 | pmid = 8555116 | date = Spring 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have indicated that it is important to consider the effect of domestic violence and its psychophysiologic sequelae on women who are mothers of infants and young children. Several studies have shown that maternal interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can, despite traumatized mother's best efforts, interfere with their child's response to the domestic violence and other traumatic events.&lt;ref name=care/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schechter | first1 = Daniel S. | last2 = Coates | first2 = Susan W. | last3 = Kaminer | first3 = Tammy | last4 = Coots | first4 = Tammy | last5 = Zeanah, Jr. | first5 = Charles H. | last6 = Davies | first6 = Mark | last7 = Schonfeld | first7 = Irvin S. | last8 = Marshall | first8 = Randall D. | last9 = Liebowitz | first9 = Michael R. | last10 = Trabka | first10 = Kimberly A. | last11 = McCaw | first11 = Jaime E. | last12 = Myers | first12 = Michael M. | title = Distorted maternal mental representations and atypical behavior in a clinical sample of violence-exposed mothers and their toddlers | journal = Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–147 | doi = 10.1080/15299730802045666 | pmid = 18985165 | pmc = 2577290 | date = June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial===
Once victims leave their perpetrator, they can be stunned with the reality of the extent to which the abuse has taken away their autonomy. Due to economic abuse and isolation, the victim usually has very little money of their own and few people on whom they can rely when seeking help. This has been shown to be one of the greatest obstacles facing victims of DV, and the strongest factor that can discourage them from leaving their perpetrators.&lt;ref name="Stop Violence Against Women"&gt;{{cite web | title = Domestic violence and housing | url = https://www.stopvaw.org/Domestic_Violence_and_Housing.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151002061435/http://www.stopvaw.org/Domestic_Violence_and_Housing.html | archive-date = 2 October 2015 | website = stopvaw.org | publisher = Stop Violence Against Women: a project of the Advocates for Human Rights | date = August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to lacking financial resources, victims of DV often lack specialized skills, education, and training that are necessary to find gainful employment, and also may have several children to support. In 2003, thirty-six major US cities cited DV as one of the primary causes of homelessness in their areas.&lt;ref name="aclu.org"&gt;{{cite web | title = Domestic violence and homelessness | url = https://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/housing%20paper.4.pdf | website = aclu.org | publisher = American Civil Liberties Union Women's Rights Project | date = 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130812013406/http://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/housing%20paper.4.pdf | archivedate = 2013-08-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been reported that one out of every three homeless women are homeless due to having left a DV relationship. If a victim is able to secure rental housing, it is likely that her apartment complex will have "zero tolerance" policies for crime; these policies can cause them to face eviction even if they are the victim (not the perpetrator) of violence.&lt;ref name="aclu.org"/&gt; While the number of shelters and community resources available to DV victims has grown tremendously, these agencies often have few employees and hundreds of victims seeking assistance which causes many victims to remain without the assistance they need.&lt;ref name="Stop Violence Against Women"/&gt;

Women and children experiencing domestic violence undergo [[occupational apartheid]]; they are typically denied access to desired occupations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cage | first = Anthea | title = Occupational therapy with women and children survivors of domestic violence: are we fulfilling our activist heritage?

An analysis in the US showed that 106 of the 771 officer killings between 1996 and 2009 occurred during domestic violence interventions.&lt;ref name=officers&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer |first1=Shannon |last2=Carroll |first2=Randall H. |title=When officers die: understanding deadly domestic violence calls for service |journal=The Police Chief |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=24–27 |date=May 2011 |url=http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=2378&amp;issue_id=52011|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906013511/http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=2378&amp;issue_id=52011 |archivedate=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 51% were defined as unprovoked or as ambushes, taking place before officers had made contact with suspects. Another 40% occurred after contact and the remainder took place during tactical situations (those involving hostages and attempts to overcome barricades).&lt;ref name=officers/&gt; The [[FBI]]'s [[National Incident Based Reporting System#LEOKA segment|LEOKA]] system grouped officer domestic violence response deaths into the category of disturbances, along with "bar fights, gang matters, and persons brandishing weapons," which may have given rise to a misperception of the risks involved.&lt;ref name=officers/&gt;&lt;ref name="BuzawaBuzawa2003"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Buzawa | first1 = Eva Schlesinger | last2 = Buzawa | first2 = Carl G. | title = Domestic violence: the criminal justice response | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780761924487 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9jCJXOxKXoUC&amp;pg=PA80 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160623192417/https://books.google.com/books?id=9jCJXOxKXoUC&amp;pg=PA80 | archivedate = 2016-06-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the gravity and intensity of hearing victims’ stories of abuse, professionals (social workers, police, counselors, therapists, advocates, medical professionals) are at risk themselves for secondary or vicarious trauma (VT), which causes the responder to experience trauma symptoms similar to the original victim after hearing about the victim’s experiences with abuse.&lt;ref name="Iliffe"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iliffe | first1 = Gillian | last2 = Steed | first2 = Lyndall G. | title = Exploring the counselor's experience of working with perpetrators and survivors of domestic violence | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 393–412 | doi = 10.1177/088626000015004004 | date = April 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has demonstrated that professionals who experience vicarious trauma show signs of exaggerated startle response, [[hypervigilance]], nightmares, and [[intrusive thoughts]] although they have not experienced a trauma personally and do not qualify for a clinical diagnosis of PTSD.&lt;ref name="Iliffe" /&gt;

There exist several strategies that are being used to attempt to prevent or reduce DV. It is important to assess the effectiveness of a strategy that is being implemented.&lt;ref name="who.int1"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Preventing intimate partner and sexual violence against women: taking action and generating evidence | publisher = World Health Organization | location = Geneva, Switzerland | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44350/1/9789241564007_eng.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205034703/http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44350/1/9789241564007_eng.pdf | archivedate = 2016-02-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reforming the legislation in order to ensure that domestic violence falls under the scope of the law is important. This may imply repealing existing laws which discriminate against women: according to the WHO, "when the law allows husbands to physically discipline wives, implementing a programme to prevent intimate partner violence may have little impact".&lt;ref name="who.int1"/&gt; [[Marriage law]]s are also important, "They [women] should also be able to enter freely into a marriage or to leave it, to obtain financial credit, and to own and administer property."&lt;ref name="who.int1"/&gt; Abolishing or restricting the offering and receiving of [[dowry]] and [[bride price]] and scrutinizing the impact of these transactions on the legislative decisions regarding DV is also important. UN Women has stated that the legislation should ensure that "a perpetrator of domestic violence, including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defence to a domestic violence charge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Supplement to the handbook for legislation on violence against women: "harmful practices" against women | publisher = UN Women | location = New York | year = 2012 | url = http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150610131259/http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2015-06-10  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender norms that promote the inferiority of women may lead to the abuse of women by intimate partners. The WHO writes that, "Dismantling hierarchical constructions of masculinity and femininity predicated on the control of women, and eliminating the structural factors that support inequalities are likely to make a significant contribution to preventing intimate partner and sexual violence".&lt;ref name="who.int1"/&gt;

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], "A key strategy in preventing domestic violence is the promotion of respectful, nonviolent relationships through individual, community, and societal level change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Prevent domestic violence in your community | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151003152901/http://www.cdc.gov/features/intimatepartnerviolence/ | archive-date = 3 October 2015 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/features/intimatepartnerviolence/ | website = cdc.gov | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early intervention programs, such as school-based programs to prevent [[dating violence]] are also effective.&lt;ref name="who.int1"/&gt; Children who grow up in violent homes may be led to believe that such behavior is a normal part of life, therefore it is important to challenge such attitudes when they are present among these children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dept. for Health | author-link = Department of Health (United Kingdom) | title = Responding to domestic abuse: a handbook for health professionals | publisher = [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] | location = London, UK | year = 2005 | url = http://dh.gov.uk/en/publicationsandstatistics/publications/publicationspolicyandguidance/dh_4126161 | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060123125814/dh.gov.uk/en/publicationsandstatistics/publications/publicationspolicyandguidance/dh_4126161 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2006-01-23 | oclc = 278343897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fenfluramine''', formerly sold under the brand name '''Pondimin''' among others, is an [[anorectic|appetite suppressant]] which was used to treat [[obesity]] and is now no longer marketed.&lt;ref name="Barceloux2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald G.

==Medical uses==
Fenfluramine was formerly used as an appetite suppressant to treat obesity.&lt;ref name="Barceloux2012" /&gt; It was available both alone and in combination with [[phentermine]], another appetite suppressant.&lt;ref name="Barceloux2012" /&gt;

==Adverse effects==
At higher therapeutic doses, [[headache]], [[diarrhea]], [[dizziness]], [[dry mouth]], [[erectile dysfunction]], [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], [[irritability]], [[lethargy]], and [[psychostimulant|{{abbr|CNS|central nervous system}} stimulation]] have been reported with fenfluramine.&lt;ref name="Dart2004" /&gt;

There have been reports associating chronic fenfluramine treatment with [[emotional instability]], [[cognitive deficit]]s, [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[psychosis]], exacerbation of pre-existing psychosis ([[schizophrenia]]), and [[sleep disturbance]]s.&lt;ref name="Dart2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D.)Ahuja2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James O'Donnell (Pharm.

===Heart valve disease===
The distinctive valvular abnormality seen with fenfluramine is a thickening of the leaflet and [[chordae tendineae]]. One mechanism used to explain this phenomenon involves heart valve serotonin receptors, which are thought to help regulate growth. Since fenfluramine and its active metabolite [[norfenfluramine]] stimulate serotonin receptors, this may have led to the valvular abnormalities found in patients using fenfluramine. In particular norfenfluramine is a potent inhibitor of the re-uptake of 5-HT into nerve terminals.&lt;ref name="pmid11489456 "&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Vickers SP, Dourish CT, Kennett GA | title = Evidence that hypophagia induced by d-fenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine in the rat is mediated by 5-HT2C receptors | journal = Neuropharmacology | year = 2001 | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 200–9 | pmid = 11489456 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3908(01)00063-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fenfluramine and its active metabolite norfenfluramine affect the [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors]], which are plentiful in human cardiac valves. The suggested mechanism by which fenfluramine causes damage is through over or inappropriate stimulation of these receptors leading to inappropriate valve cell division. Supporting this idea is the fact that this valve abnormality has also occurred in patients using other drugs that act on 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.&lt;ref name="pmid17202450"&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Roth, B.

According to a study of 5,743 former users conducted by a plaintiff's expert cardiologist, damage to the heart valve continued long after stopping the medication.&lt;ref name="pmid18990200"&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Dahl, C.

For all ex-users, there was a 7-fold increase of chances of needing surgery for faulty heart valves caused by the drug.&lt;ref name="pmid18990200" /&gt;

==Overdose==
In [[overdose]], fenfluramine can cause [[serotonin syndrome]] and rapidly result in death.&lt;ref name="Barceloux2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MannCaroff2008"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors = Mann SC, Caroff SN, Keck PE, Lazarus A|title=Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome and Related Conditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=POjw-pQcvW8C&amp;pg=PA111|date=20 May 2008|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=978-1-58562-744-8|pages=111–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Fenfluramine acts primarily as a [[serotonin releasing agent]].&lt;ref name="pmid12649307" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12761331" /&gt; It increases the level of [[serotonin]], a [[neurotransmitter]] that regulates mood, appetite and other functions.&lt;ref name="pmid12649307" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12761331" /&gt; Fenfluramine [[releasing agent|causes the release]] of serotonin by disrupting [[synaptic vesicle|vesicular]] storage of the neurotransmitter, and reversing serotonin [[membrane transport protein|transporter]] function.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | authorlink = Eric J. Nestler | author = Nestler, E. J. | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug also acts as a [[norepinephrine releasing agent]] to a lesser extent, particularly via its [[active metabolite]] [[norfenfluramine]].&lt;ref name="pmid12649307" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12761331" /&gt; At high concentrations, norfenfluramine, though not fenfluramine, also acts as a [[dopamine releasing agent]], and so fenfluramine may do this at very high doses as well.&lt;ref name="pmid12649307" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12761331" /&gt; In addition to monoamine release, while fenfluramine binds only very weakly to the serotonin [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]]s, norfenfluramine binds to and activates the serotonin [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]]s with high affinity and the serotonin [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] with moderate affinity.&lt;ref name="GiovanniMatteo2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Giuseppe Di Giovanni|author2=Vincenzo Di Matteo|author3=Ennio Esposito|title=Serotonin-dopamine Interaction: Experimental Evidence and Therapeutic Relevance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mPkKtA15KM8C&amp;pg=PA393|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-53235-0|pages=393–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10617681"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fitzgerald LW, Burn TC, Brown BS, Patterson JP, Corjay MH, Valentine PA, Sun JH, Link JR, Abbaszade I, Hollis JM, Largent BL, Hartig PR, Hollis GF, Meunier PC, Robichaud AJ, Robertson DW | title = Possible role of valvular serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptors in the cardiopathy associated with fenfluramine | journal = Mol.

The combination of fenfluramine with [[phentermine]], a [[norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent]] acting primarily on norepinephrine, results in a well-balanced [[serotonin–norepinephrine releasing agent]] with weaker effects of dopamine release.&lt;ref name="pmid12649307" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12761331" /&gt;

Fenfluramine was developed in the early 1960s and was introduced in [[France]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="Barceloux2012" /&gt; Approximately 50&amp;nbsp;million Europeans were treated with fenfluramine for appetite suppression between 1963 and 1996.&lt;ref name="Barceloux2012" /&gt; Fenfluramine was approved in the [[United States]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="Barceloux2012" /&gt; The combination of fenfluramine and phentermine was proposed in 1984.&lt;ref name="Barceloux2012" /&gt; Approximately 5&amp;nbsp;million people in the United States were given fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine with or without phentermine between 1996 and 1998.&lt;ref name="Barceloux2012" /&gt;

In the early 1990s, French researchers reported an association of fenfluramine with primary [[pulmonary hypertension]] and [[dyspnea]] in a small sample of patients.&lt;ref name="Barceloux2012" /&gt; Fenfluramine was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 1997 after reports of [[valvular heart disease|heart valve disease]]&lt;ref name="pmid9271479"&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Connolly, H.

==Society and culture==

===Brand names===
Fenfluramine was formerly marketed under the brand names Pondimin, Ponderax, and Adifax, among others.

===Recreational use===
Unlike various other amphetamine derivatives, fenfluramine is reported to be [[dysphoric]], "unpleasantly [[lethargy|lethargic]]", and non-[[addictive]] at therapeutic doses.&lt;ref name="Brust2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Calvin M.

Under the development code '''ZX008''', the pharmaceutical company Zogenix is studying fenfluramine's potential to treat [[seizure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.drugdevelopment-technology.com/news/zogenix-ends-enrolment-second-phase-lll-trial-zx008/|title=Zogenix ends enrolment in second Phase lll trial of ZX008|last=&lt;!--no byline--&gt;|first=|date=1 February 2018|work=Drug Development Technology|access-date=3 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204124032/http://www.drugdevelopment-technology.com/news/zogenix-ends-enrolment-second-phase-lll-trial-zx008/|archive-date=2018-02-04|dead-url=no|publisher=Kable|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical trials have studied the use of fenfluramine in patients with [[Dravet syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02926898|title=A Two-Part Study to Investigate the Dose-Ranging Safety and Pharmacokinetics, Followed by the Efficacy and Safety of ZX008 (Fenfluramine Hydrochloride) Oral Solution as an Adjunctive Therapy in Children ≥2 Years Old and Young Adults With Dravet Syndrome - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov|author=|date=|website=clinicaltrials.gov|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929183517/https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02926898|archivedate=29 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results of a [[phase III]] clinical trial showed a 64% reduction in seizures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/29/zogenix-drug-cuts-seizure-rate-severe-epilepsy-patients-stock-price-skyrockets/|title=Zogenix drug cuts seizure rate in patients with severe epilepsy|author=|date=29 September 2017|website=statnews.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430172302/https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/29/zogenix-drug-cuts-seizure-rate-severe-epilepsy-patients-stock-price-skyrockets/|archivedate=30 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''First Tuesday''' is a networking forum for technology start-ups, their investors and related service providers.

==History==

First Tuesday was launched on the first Tuesday of October 1998 at the Alphabet Bar in [[London]] by its founders Adam Gold, [[Julie Meyer]], Mark Davies, John Browning and [[Nick Denton]]. The early First Tuesdays were held in the loft on Great Titchfield Street which housed Syzygy’s offices. Each month London’s Internet digerati would gather for drinks, and to listen to a speaker and share information on raising money and growing their Internet businesses.&lt;ref name=Riptide-NickDenton-2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nisenholtz|first1=Martin|title=Interview Subjects: Nick Denton|url=http://www.digitalriptide.org/person/nick-denton/|accessdate=23 March 2016|work=Riptide|publisher=[[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy]]|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early speakers included Rikki Tahta,  [[Brent Hoberman]] and [[Martha Lane Fox]], the founders of [[Lastminute.com]]; and [[John Taysom]].&lt;ref&gt;"Meet-Markets For The New Economy First Tuesday's parties " by Nicholas Stein [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/07/10/283754/index.htm Fortune] July 10, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In late Spring 1999 Meyer left her job at NewMedia Investors to build First Tuesday's international network. In September 1999, First Tuesday launched into 17 cities across [[Europe]]. At Christmas 1999 and through the Millennium, Julie Meyer went to [[Israel]], meeting Shlomo Kalisch of Jerusalem Global who had launched Yazam, a similar concept to First Tuesday.

First Tuesday London was incorporated in early February 2000. Yazam tried to purchase First Tuesday in February 2000, but failed, ultimately succeeding on the 20th of July 2000. First Tuesday's City Leaders and Julie Meyer had led an alternative funding strategy with investments ready from Karl Christian Agerup of NorthZone Ventures and Rod Schwartz of [[Catalyst Technologies]]. This funding might have enabled First Tuesday to implement appropriate business models, corporate structures and management teams. The business model emerging through the structured First Tuesday Matchmaking events was to take 2% of funds raised at a First Tuesday Matchmaking event. Despite evidence that this was taking off, the company was sold.
 
First Tuesday was run as an independent business or not-for-profit organisation in most countries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The '''Hainan Island incident''' occurred on April 1, 2001, when a [[United States Navy]] [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E ARIES II]] [[SIGINT|signals intelligence]] aircraft and a [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] (PLAN) [[Shenyang J-8|J-8II]] [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] jet collided in mid-air, resulting in an international dispute between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China (PRC).

The EP-3 was operating about {{convert|70|mi|km}} away from the PRC &lt;!--Use PRC as this has to do with politics--&gt; island province of [[Hainan]], and about {{convert|100|mi|km}} away from the Chinese military installation in the [[Paracel Islands]], when it was intercepted by two J-8 fighters. A collision between the EP-3 and one of the J-8s caused the death of a PRC&lt;!--Use PRC as this is in a political standpoint--&gt; pilot, and the EP-3 was forced to make an emergency landing on Hainan. The 24 crew members were detained and interrogated by the Chinese authorities until a statement was delivered by the United States government regarding the incident. The exact phrasing of this document was intentionally ambiguous and allowed both countries to save [[Face (sociological concept)|face]] while defusing a potentially volatile situation between militarily strong regional states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = War of words – George W. Bush|url = http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2001/04/12/china | accessdate =September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wiley1"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Culture and apology: The Hainan Island incident|doi =10.1111/1467-971X.00222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
This sea area includes the [[South China Sea Islands]], which are claimed by the PRC and several other countries. It is one of the most strategically sensitive areas in the world.&lt;ref name="Brookes102"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brookes|2002|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The United States and the People's Republic of China disagree on the legality of the overflights by U.S. naval aircraft of the area where the incident occurred. This part of the [[South China Sea]] comprises part of the PRC's [[exclusive economic zone]] based on the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] and the Chinese claim that the Paracel Islands belong to China (this and similar claims have been persistently contested by Vietnam, the Philippines, and international observers). The PRC interprets the Convention as allowing it to preclude other nations' military operations within this area, but the United States does not recognize China's claim over the Paracel Islands and maintains that the Convention grants free navigation for all countries' aircraft and ships, including military aircraft and ships, within a country's exclusive economic zone.

==In the air==
The EP-3 (BuNo ''156511''), assigned to Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron One (VQ-1, "World Watchers"), had taken off as Mission&amp;nbsp;PR32 from [[Kadena Air Base]] in [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], Japan. At about 09:15 local time, toward the end of the EP-3's six-hour [[ELINT]] mission, two Chinese J-8s from Lingshui airfield, on the Chinese island of [[Hainan]], approached the EP-3 as it flew at {{convert|22000|ft|m}} and {{convert|180|kn|mph}}, on a heading of 110°, about {{convert|70|mi|km}} away from the island. One of the J-8s (''81192''), piloted by [[Lieutenant Commander|Lt. Cdr.]] Wang Wei,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher = Key Publishing| location = Stamford, Lincolnshire| title = Air Forces Monthly|date=May 2001| volume = 158| page = 4| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Air Forces Monthly| publisher = Key Publishing| location = Stamford, Lincolnshire| date = June 2001| volume = 159| page =79| ref = harv| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; made two close passes to the EP-3. On the third pass, it collided with the larger aircraft. The J-8 broke into two pieces; the EP-3's [[radome]] detached completely and its No. 1 (outer left) propeller was severely damaged. Airspeed and altitude data were lost, the aircraft depressurized, and an antenna became wrapped around the tailplane. The J-8's tail fin struck the EP-3's left [[aileron]] forcing it fully upright, and causing the U.S. aircraft to roll to the left at 3–4 times its normal maximum rate.&lt;ref name="Brookes102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intercept" &gt;{{cite news |url=https://theintercept.com/2017/04/10/snowden-documents-reveal-scope-of-secrets-exposed-to-china-in-2001-spy-plane-incident/ |title=Snowden Documents Reveal Scope of Secrets Exposed to China in 2001 Spy Plane Incident |first=Kim |last=Zetter |date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2017 |publisher=''[[The Intercept]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KampfflugzeugF-8China-2009-01-04.jpg|left|thumb|[[Shenyang J-8]] ''81192'', the aircraft that collided with the EP-3E]]
The impact sent the EP-3 into a 30° dive at a bank angle of 130°, almost inverted. It dropped {{convert|8000|ft|m}} in 30&amp;nbsp;seconds, and fell another {{convert|6000|ft|m}} before the pilot, [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] [[Shane Osborn]], got the EP-3's wings level and the nose up.&lt;ref name="NAN"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lt. Shane Osborn: looking at a miracle |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/2000s/2003/so03/osborn.pdf |publisher=Naval Aviation News |date=September–October 2003 |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |first=Jim |last=Turnbull |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513020628/http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/2000s/2003/so03/osborn.pdf |archivedate=May 13, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a September 2003 article in ''Naval Aviation News'', Osborn said that once he regained control of the aircraft he "called for the crew to prepare to bail out."&lt;ref name="Intercept" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NAN"/&gt; He then managed to control the aircraft's descent by using emergency power on the working engines, such that an emergency landing on Hainan became a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brookes|2002|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shenyang J-8 81192 harrasses American aircraft.webm|thumb|right|The Shenyang J-8 (81192) in another altercation with a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft in January 2001.]]

For the next 26&amp;nbsp;minutes the crew of the EP-3 carried out an emergency plan which included destroying sensitive items on board the aircraft, such as electronic equipment related to intelligence gathering, documents and data. Part of this plan involved pouring freshly brewed coffee into disk drives and motherboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brookes|2002|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew had not been formally trained on how to destroy sensitive documents and equipment, and as a result had to improvise.&lt;ref name="Intercept" /&gt;

The EP-3 made an unauthorized emergency landing at Lingshui airfield, after at least 15&amp;nbsp;[[distress signal]]s had gone unanswered, with the [[Transponder code|emergency code]] selected on the [[transponder]]. It landed at {{convert|170|kn|mph}}, with no [[flap (aircraft)|flaps]], no [[trim tab|trim]], and a damaged left [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]], weighing {{convert|108000|lb|kg}}. Following the collision, the failure of the nose cone had disabled the No. 3 (inner right) engine, and the No. 1 propeller could not be [[Feathering (propeller)|feathered]], leading to increased drag on that side. There was no working [[airspeed indicator]] or [[altimeter]], and Osborn used full right aileron during the landing. The surviving Chinese interceptor had landed there 10&amp;nbsp;minutes earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brookes|2002|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lt. Cdr. Wang was seen to eject after the collision, but the Pentagon said that the damage to the underside of the EP-3 could mean that the cockpit of the Chinese fighter jet was crushed, making it impossible for the pilot to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Chinese Plane Flew Too Close| url = http://www.taiwandc.org/latimes-2001-01.htm| last = Richter| first = Paul| publisher = taiwandc.org| date = April 6, 2001| accessdate =March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brookes|2002|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wang's body was never recovered, and he was declared dead.

===Cause of collision===
[[File:Hainanincidentmap.png|thumb|right|Area of the collision in the South China Sea]]
Both the cause of the collision and the assignment of blame were disputed. The U.S. government claimed that the Chinese jet bumped the wing of the larger, slower, and less maneuverable EP-3. After returning to U.S. soil, the pilot of the EP-3, Lt. Shane Osborn, was allowed to make a brief statement in which he said that the EP-3 was on autopilot and in straight-and-level flight at the time of the collision. He stated that he was just "guarding the autopilot" in his interview with ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/china/interviews/osborn.html ''Frontline'' interview with Shane Osborn], retrieved August 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. released video footage from previous missions which revealed that American reconnaissance crews had previously been intercepted by the same aircraft.&lt;ref name="Hotdog video"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kates|first1=Brian|title=U.S. Blames China's Hot-dogging Pilots Harassment in Midair Seen as Cause of Crash|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/u-s-blames-china-hot-dogging-pilots-harassment-midair-crash-article-1.915724|accessdate=5 December 2016|work=New York Daily News|date=14 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the account of Wang Wei's [[wingman]], the Chinese government stated that the American aircraft "veered at a wide angle towards the Chinese", in the process ramming the J-8.  This claim cannot be verified since the Chinese government refuses to release data from the [[flight recorder]]s of either aircraft, both of which are in its possession.&lt;ref name="Brookes107"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brookes|2002|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1275404.stm| title = Chinese jet 'snapped in two'| publisher = [[BBC Online]]| date = April 13, 2001| accessdate =March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/04/01/us.china.plane.03/ |title=U.S. aircraft collides with Chinese fighter, forced to land |publisher=CNN |date=April 1, 2001 |accessdate=March 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211063330/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/04/01/us.china.plane.03/ |archivedate=December 11, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Richter| first = Paul| url = http://www.taiwandc.org/latimes-2001-01.htm| title = Chinese Plane Flew Too Close| publisher = taiwandc.org| date = April 6, 2001| accessdate =March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=3&amp;art_id=qw987678182850P610| title = China says video shows US plane caused crash| publisher = iol.co.za| date = April 19, 2001| last = Eckert| first = Paul| accessdate =March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On the ground==
For 15 minutes after landing, the EP-3 crew continued to destroy sensitive items and data on board the aircraft, as per protocol. They disembarked from the aircraft after soldiers looked through windows, pointed guns, and shouted through bullhorns. The Chinese offered them water and cigarettes. Kept under close guard, they were taken to a military barracks at [[Lingshui Li Autonomous County|Lingshui]] where they were interrogated for two nights before being moved to lodgings in [[Haikou]], the provincial capital and largest city on the island. They were generally treated well, but were interrogated at all hours, and so suffered from lack of sleep. They found the Chinese food unpalatable as it included fish heads, but this later improved. Guards gave them decks of cards and an English-language newspaper. To pass the time and keep spirits up, Lts. Honeck and Vignery worked up humorous routines based on the television shows ''[[The People's Court]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The Crocodile Hunter]]''. These were performed as they went to meals, the only time they were together. They gradually developed good relations with their guards, with one guard inquiring of them the lyrics for the song "[[Hotel California]]" by the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brookes|2002|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three U.S. diplomats were sent to Hainan to meet the crew and assess their conditions, and to negotiate their release. They were first allowed to meet with the crew three days after the collision. U.S. officials complained at the slow pace of the Chinese decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/us-diplomats-meet-with-spy-plane-crew-753137.html| title = US diplomats meet with spy plane crew| publisher = ''[[The Independent]]''| date = April 3, 2001| accessdate =March 24, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 24 crew members (21 men and 3 women)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brookes|2002|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; were detained until April 11, shortly after the U.S. issued the "letter of the two sorries" to the Chinese. The Chinese military boarded the EP-3 and thoroughly stripped and examined the aircraft's equipment.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The crew was only partially successful in their destruction of classified material, and some of the material they failed to destroy included [[cryptographic keys]], [[signals intelligence]] manuals, and the names of [[National Security Agency]] employees.&lt;ref name="Intercept" /&gt; Some of the captured computers contained detailed information for processing PROFORMA communications from [[North Korea]], [[Russia]], [[Vietnam]], [[China]] and other countries.&lt;ref name="Intercept" /&gt; The plane also carried information on the emitter parameters for U.S.-allied [[radar]] systems worldwide.&lt;ref name="Intercept" /&gt; The fact that the United States could track [[People's Liberation Army Navy|PLAN]] [[submarines]] via signal transmission was also revealed to China.&lt;ref name="Intercept" /&gt;

==Letter of the two sorries==
{{Wikisource|Letter of the two sorries}}
The "Letter of the two sorries"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0104/11/bn.24.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com | date=April 11, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the letter delivered by the United States Ambassador [[Joseph Prueher]] to [[Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China|Foreign Minister]] [[Tang Jiaxuan]] of the People's Republic of China to defuse the incident. The delivery of the letter led to the release of the U.S. crew from Chinese custody, as well as the eventual return of the disassembled aircraft.&lt;ref name="Brookes107"/&gt;

The letter stated that the United States was "very sorry" for the death of Chinese pilot Wang Wei, and was "very sorry" the aircraft entered China's airspace and that its landing did not have "verbal clearance".&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, Daryl et al. "[http://www.salon.com/2001/04/12/china_28/ War of words]". Salon.com, April 12, 2001, retrieved on March 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States stated that it was "not a letter of apology," as some state-run Chinese media outlets characterized it at the time, but "an expression of regret and sorrow".&lt;ref name="wiley1"/&gt;  China had originally asked for an apology, but the U.S. explained, "We did not do anything wrong, and therefore it was not possible to apologize."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Bush+pleased+by+release+of+U.S.+crew+from+China-a073374676 | title = Bush pleased by release of U.S. crew from China|accessdate =October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was further debate over the exact meaning of the Chinese translation issued by the U.S. Embassy. A senior administration official was quoted as saying "What the Chinese will choose to characterize as an apology, we would probably choose to characterize as an expression of regret or sorrow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2001/04/12/81342| title=China, US agree on freeing plane crew| work=Taipei Times| date=April 12, 2001| accessdate=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
&lt;!--[[File:Steve and pres-2009-29-03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Crew member Navy AE3 Steven Blocher welcomed to the White House by President George W. Bush]] Removed pending clarification on the FAC page--&gt;
The crew of the EP-3 was released on April 11, 2001, and returned to their base at [[Naval Air Station Whidbey Island|Whidbey Island]] via [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, where they were subject to two days of intense debriefings, followed by a heroes' welcome.&lt;ref name="Brookes107"/&gt; The pilot, Lt. [[Shane Osborn]], was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for "heroism and extraordinary achievement" in flight. The J-8 pilot, Lt. Cdr. Wang Wei, was posthumously honored in China as a "Guardian of Territorial Airspace and Waters".&lt;ref name="Brookes107"/&gt; His widow received a personal letter of condolence from President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/s/w_asia/1268184.stm| title = US spy crew 'in excellent health{{'-}}| publisher = BBC Online| date = April 9, 2001| accessdate =March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EP-3's crew return.jpg|thumb|right|The EP-3 crew arrives at Hickam AFB in Hawaii. (Pictured saluting is U.S. Air Force [[Senior Airman]] Curtis Towne.)]]
U.S. Navy engineers said the EP-3 could be repaired in 8–12 months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Spy plane might not fly home| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1341332.stm| publisher = BBC Online| date = May 20, 2001| accessdate =March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but China refused to allow it to be flown off Hainan island. The disassembled aircraft was released on July 3, 2001, and was returned to the United States by the Russian airline [[Polet Airlines|Polet]] in an [[Antonov An-124 Ruslan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1380725.stm| title = Russians to fly out spy plane| publisher = BBC Online| date = June 10, 2001| accessdate =March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repairs took place at Integrated Systems of Waco, Texas as they were the main provider of P3 maintenance and modernization at the time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} The aircraft was reported to have flown back to the same international waters near the China coast to continue its reconnaissance missions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In addition to paying for the dismantling and shipping of the EP-3, the United States paid for the 11&amp;nbsp;days of food and lodging supplied by the Chinese government to the aircraft's crew, in the amount of $34,567.89.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mufson |first=Steven |url=http://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/U-S-to-pay-China-34-567-related-to-spy-plane-2054396.php# |title=US to pay China $34,567 related to spy plane incident |newspaper=The Washington Post |publisher=Hearst Newspapers|date=August 10, 2001 |access-date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese had demanded one million dollars compensation from the U.S. for the lost J-8 and their pilot, but this was declined and no further negotiations were held.

The incident took place ten weeks after the inauguration of George W. Bush as president and was his first foreign policy crisis. Both sides were criticized following the event; the Chinese for making a bluff which was called without any real concessions from the American side other than the "Letter of the two sorries," and the U.S. first for being insensitive immediately after the event and later for issuing the letter rather than taking a harder line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.economist.com/agenda/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_VSGTDP| title = Chinese poker| work= The Economist| date = April 17, 2001| accessdate =March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the collision, China's monitoring of reconnaissance flights became less aggressive for a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Ellison| first = Michael| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/30/china.usa| title = China eases spy plane surveillance| work= [[The Guardian]]| date = July 30, 2001| accessdate =March 13, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2011, flights of U.S. surveillance aircraft near the Chinese coastline continued as before the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin |first=Dan |url=https://news.yahoo.com/china-tells-us-halt-spy-plane-flights-report-061346358.html |title=China tells US to halt spy plane flights |publisher=Yahoo!

The ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' episode "Dog Robber" that aired in late 2001 was loosely based on this event.

'''''Hey, Hey, It's the Monkees''''' is a one-hour comedy special televised on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Network]] on Monday February 17, 1997. The show features all four of the original [[The Monkees|Monkees]] and would be the last time [[Micky Dolenz]], [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]], [[Michael Nesmith]], and [[Peter Tork]] would appear together in a new television program. Michael Nesmith wrote and directed the program.

This is not to be confused with the similarly titled documentary from 1997, ''[[Hey, Hey, We're the Monkees]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|date=2017-08-26|title=1997 Rhino Monkees documentary|url=http://www.monkeeslivealmanac.com/blog/1996-rhino-monkees-documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The special shows the now middle-aged Monkees trying to come up with a new plot (apparently they've all been done by now) while still trying to catch their big break.&lt;ref name="oldtimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Braxton|first=Greg|date=2012-02-29|title=Davy Jones' last Monkees TV reunion was just like old times|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2012/02/hey-hey-its-the-monkees-1997-tv-reunion-was-just-like-old-times.html|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the music featured in the special came from the quartet's 1996 album ''[[Justus (album)|Justus]]''; the group also performs a medley of 5 of their biggest 1960s hits; "[[Last Train to Clarksville]]", "[[Daydream Believer]]", "[[(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone]]", "[[I'm a Believer]]" and "[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]". These songs are shown as performances by the group in 1997, intercut with performances of these same songs from their 1960s television series. As of April 2017, it has not been made available on DVD or Blu-ray.

Game show host [[Chuck Woolery]] makes a cameo.

==Plot==

The special opens with Micky presenting his new beverage that will give the Monkees a gimmick (specifically, vomiting on stage) and their "ticket to success." Davy is concerned that such a gimmick will not go over well at their prestigious gig later that night.

A lawyer arrives at the door, offering the Monkees an inheritance if they spend the night in a haunted mansion. Micky verifies with Mike that they already did that story line and sends the lawyer on his way. Soon after, a young woman rushes in with two more plot suggestions. The Monkees reject them and begin rehearsing.

Afterward, they go for a walk on the beach. Mike explains that he converted the Mokeemobile into a low rider and a "dimension machine". This leads to a discussion about the need for gimmicks for the band and story lines for the show. They meet up with a young boy who says his pet pig is going to be sold for bacon. The guys ultimately reject the plot, but Micky manages to cheer him up with special effects. They rehearse some more and then head back to the pad to get ready for the gig.

As the Monkees get dressed, a couple outside the pad discusses an urban legend about the four crazy guys who live there. Micky interrupts them before they decide to [[toilet papering|toilet paper]] the house. The Monkees then pile into the Monkeemobile, and Mike demonstrates the new functionality he installed, including buttons that revert the surroundings to the 1960s, or transform one object into another.

At the club, they meet the manager, who introduces himself as Chuck and his daughter as the "princess". He tells them that he could lose the club if they don't play their older hits, but the guys emphasize that they want to promote their new album. The princess talks Davy into playing a few old hits, and the concert begins. Outside, the young boy returns with his friends, and they start playing with the Monkeemobile's special functions, causing the Monkees and the club audience to bounce back and forth between the 1990s and the 1960s, and the musical instruments transform into various objects. The concert is a success, and Chuck announces that his club was saved. He also congratulates the guys on making it through the entire special without resorting to the silly antics their show was known for.

As the Monkees drive home, they wonder how many people realize that their show and other classics are still produced even though they aren't on television anymore. When they arrive at their house, it is completely draped in toilet paper. Having realized that the use of special effects was causing their show to run short (and so stock footage of a lizard sunning itself on a rock had been edited in at various points earlier), they agree that one last special effects display of confetti and fireworks is appropriate.

==Development==

The wheels began rolling when ABC approached Monkees manager Ward Sylvester in November, 1996 about producing a Monkees retrospective. Sylvester countered with the suggestion that they make a new episode of the original TV series.&lt;ref name="fanzine1997"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|date=2017-06-03|title=Monkee Business Fanzine details the making of The Monkees' 1997 ABC television special|url=http://www.monkeeslivealmanac.com/blog/monkee-business-fanzine-details-the-making-of-the-monkees-1997-abc-television-special|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shot the following January, the special was a complete collaboration of all four Monkees in virtually every aspect of the project, from writing and directing (Mike), to casting (Micky), to music supervision and mixing (Peter), to staging (Davy).

The special featured the return of the Monkeemobile and the beach pad, as well as location filming on the beach in Malibu. According to photographer Henry Diltz, the guys were "really into it" and "played up" their fictional personalities.&lt;ref name="fanzine1997" /&gt;

Post production delays caused the final print to be delivered too late for advanced screening, but the marketing push was strong, starting on Super Bowl Sunday, January 26 and continuing with ads run during some of ABC's most popular shows at the time (including a scene of ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' incorporating the "[[Theme from the Monkees|Monkees Theme]]"). Initial promos featured scenes from the film ''[[Head (film)|HEAD]]'', since scenes from the new special were unavailable and the group did not want people to see shots from the TV series and think the special was merely a retrospective filled with old clips. Ad spots with actual scenes from the special began airing on February 9.

A week before the special aired, Mike Nesmith said that ABC was pleased with the way the special turned out and expressed hope that there could be more to come.&lt;ref name="fanzine1997" /&gt;

== Premise of the Special ==

The news media have described the premise of the special as, "the group had kept filming TV shows since its weekly TV series on NBC was canceled in 1968, but they didn't have any place to air them."&lt;ref name="oldtimes" /&gt; Micky Dolenz has been quoted as saying, "We thought we'd go all the way and do another TV episode." This included setting the special in the beach pad from the original series, and showing the group driving around in the classic [[Monkeemobile]].&lt;ref name="fanzine1997" /&gt;

However, other quotes from the parties involved would seem to directly refute this idea. The 1997 summer issue of the ''Monkees H.Q.'' quotes Monkees manager Ward Sylvester as saying that they could not legally create a new episode of the original series, Micky calls it "a show within a show," and Davy contends "anyone can see" that "it's not an episode." Mike and Peter said they were "glad" to be able to play themselves rather than their fictional characters. Nesmith is also quoted in the May 1997 issue of the fanzine ''P.O. Box 9847'' as describing the TV special as being about "... us Monkees today. We made 'Justus'. It's about that. Obviously 'Justus', a real CD, wasn't made by fictional characters."

'''Historical reenactment''' (or '''re-enactment''') is an [[educational entertainment|educational or entertainment]] activity in which people follow a plan to recreate aspects of a historical event or period. This may be as narrow as a specific moment from a battle, such as the reenactment of [[Pickett's Charge]] presented during the [[Great Reunion of 1913]], or as broad as an entire period, such as [[Regency reenactment]] or [[The 1920s Berlin Project]].

==History==
[[File:Corbould edward henry thejoustbetweenthelordofthetournament.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|''The joust between the Lord of the Tournament and the Knight of the Red Rose'', a [[lithograph]] commemorating the [[Eglinton Tournament of 1839]]]]
Activities related to "reenactment" have a long history. The Romans staged recreations of famous battles within their [[Amphitheatre|amphitheaters]] as a form of public [[spectacle]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], [[tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] often reenacted historical themes from [[Ancient Rome]] or elsewhere.

Military displays and mock battles and reenactments first became popular in 17th century England. In 1638 the first known reenactment was brought to life by Lord James ‘Jimmy’ Dunn of Coniston, a staged battle between Christian and Muslim forces was enacted in London, and the [[Roundheads]], flush from a series of victories during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], reenacted a recent battle at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] in 1645, despite the ongoing conflict.&lt;ref name="Giles"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.eventplan.co.uk/page29.html| title=A Brief History of Re-enactment| author=Howard Giles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the nineteenth century that historical reenactments became widespread, reflecting the then intense [[Romantic movement|romantic]] interest in the [[medievalism|Middle Ages]]. Medieval culture was widely admired as an antidote to the modern [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and [[industrial age]]. Plays and theatrical works (such as ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', which in 1820 was playing in six different productions in [[London]] alone)&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Anstruther|Anstruther, Ian]] ''The Knight and the Umbrella: An Account of the Eglinton Tournament, 1839''. London: Geoffrey Bles Ltd, 1963. pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; perpetuated the romanticism of knights, castles, feasts and tournaments. The [[Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Duke of Buckingham]] staged naval battles from the [[Napoleonic War]] on the large lake on his estate in 1821, and a reenactment of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] was put on for a public viewing at [[Astley's Amphitheatre]] in 1824.&lt;ref name="Giles"/&gt;

Historical reenactment came of age with the grand spectacle of the [[Eglinton Tournament of 1839]], a reenactment of a [[medieval]] [[jousting|joust]] and revel held in [[Scotland]],&lt;ref name="EglintonT"&gt;Corbould, Edward. ''The Eglinton Tournament: Dedicated to the Earl of Eglinton''. Pall Mall, England: Hodgson &amp; Graves, 1840.[http://www.georgeglazer.com/archives/prints/genre/eglingtonjoust.html]. p 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and organized by [[Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton]]. The Tournament was a deliberate act of [[Romanticism]], and drew 100,000 spectators.

[[File:A map of the Eglinton Tournament features.jpg|left|thumb|Layout of the [[Eglinton Tournament of 1839|Eglinton Tournament]].]]
It was held on a meadow at a loop in the [[River Irvine|Lugton Water]]. The ground chosen for the tournament was low, almost marshy, with grassy slopes rising on all sides.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Anstruther|Anstruther, Ian]] ''The Knight and the Umbrella: An Account of the Eglinton Tournament, 1839''. London: Geoffrey Bles Ltd, 1963. pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Eglinton announced that the public would be welcome; he requested medieval fancy dress, if possible, and tickets were free. The pageant itself featured thirteen medieval knights on horseback.

The preparations, and the many works of art commissioned for or inspired by the Eglinton Tournament, had an effect on public feeling and the course of 19th-century Gothic revivalism. Its ambition carried over to events such as a similar lavish tournament in Brussels in 1905, and presaged the historical reenactments of the present. Features of the tournament were actually inspired by  [[Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[Ivanhoe]]'': it was attempting "to be a living reenactment of the literary romances".&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Karen, 2009, "The Eglinton Tournament of 1839"&lt;/ref&gt; In Eglinton’s own words "I am aware of the manifold deficiencies in its exhibition&amp;nbsp;— more perhaps than those who were not so deeply interested in it; I am aware that it was a very humble imitation of the scenes which my imagination had portrayed, but I have, at least, done something towards the revival of chivalry".&lt;ref&gt;Literary Gazette, 1831:90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reenactments of battles became more commonplace in the late 19th century, both in Britain, and also in America. Within a year of the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], survivors of [[U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment]] reenacted the scene of their defeat for the camera as a series of still poses.

[[File:Battle of namur reenactment.jpg|thumb|right|Modern reenactments of historical battles were held at [[Aldershot#The Aldershot Military Tattoo|Royal Tournament, Aldershot Tattoo]]. Pictured, the programme for the 1934 show, where the [[Siege of Namur (1695)|Siege of Namur]] was recreated.]]
In 1895, members of the [[Royal Engineers|Gloucestershire Engineer Volunteers]] reenacted their famous stand at [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorke's Drift]], 18 years earlier. 25 [[British Army|British soldiers]] beat back the attack of 75 [[Zulu people|Zulus]] at the Grand Military Fete at the [[Cheltenham|Cheltenham Winter Gardens]].&lt;ref name="Giles"/&gt;

Veterans of the [[American Civil War]] recreated battles as a way to remember their fallen comrades and to teach others what the war was all about.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. "Reliving the Civil War: A reenactor's handbook". Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 1999. p 4 "Civil War reenacting was done almost from the beginning of war, as soldiers demonstrated to family and friends their actions during the war, in camp, in drill, and in battle. Veterans organizations recreated camp life to show their children and others how they lived and to reproduce the camaraderie of shared experience with their fellow veterans."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Reunion of 1913]], celebrating the 50th anniversary of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], was attended by more than 50,000 [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veterans, and included reenactments of elements of the battle, including [[Pickett's Charge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/gett/getttour/sidebar/reunion13.htm |title=The Great Reunion of 1913 |accessdate=2008-08-15 |date=September 1998 |author=Heiser, John |publisher=[[National Park Service]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080918074740/http://www.nps.gov/archive/gett/getttour/sidebar/reunion13.htm| archivedate= 18 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early twentieth century, historical reenactment became very popular in [[Russia]] with reenactments of the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)]] (1906), the [[Battle of Borodino]] (1812) in [[St Petersburg]] and the ''Taking of Azov'' (1696) in [[Voronezh]] in 1918. In 1920, there was a reenactment of the 1917 ''[[Storming of the Winter Palace]]'' on the third anniversary of the event. This reenactment inspired the scenes in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s film ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World]]''.

Large scale reenactments began to be regularly held at the [[Aldershot#The Aldershot Military Tattoo|Royal Tournament, Aldershot Tattoo]] in the 1920s and 30s. A spectacular recreation of the [[Siege of Namur (1695)|Siege of Namur]], an important military engagement of the [[Nine Years' War]], was staged in 1934 as part of 6-day long show.&lt;ref name="Giles"/&gt;

In America, modern reenacting is thought to have begun during the 1961–1965 [[American Civil War Centennial|Civil War Centennial]] commemorations.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden. p 4 "Without a doubt, Civil War reenactment got its boost during the centennial, which also saw the birth of the [[North-South Skirmish Association]] (N-SSA)."&lt;/ref&gt; After more than 6,000 reenactors participated in a 125th anniversary event near the original Manassas battlefield, reenacting grew in popularity during the late 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Hadden. p 6 "In 1986, the first of the 125th Anniversary battles was held near the original battlefield of [[First Bull Run|Manassas]]. More than anything, this mega-event sparked an interest in the Civil War and reenacting."&lt;/ref&gt; and there are today over a hundred Civil War reenactments held each year throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beery|first1=Zoë|title=Say Goodbye to Your Happy Plantation Narrative|url=https://theoutline.com/post/3956/cheyney-mcknight-not-your-mommas-history-profile|website=The Outline|accessdate=30 March 2018|date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reenactors==

Most participants are amateurs who pursue history as a [[hobby]]. Participants within this hobby are diverse, ranging in age from young children whose parents bring them along to events, to the elderly. In addition to hobbyists, members of the armed forces and professional historians sometimes participate.

===Categories of reenactors===
Reenactors are commonly divided (or self-divide) into several broadly defined categories, based on the level of concern for [[authenticity (reenactment)|authenticity]].&lt;ref name="Dress Authenticity"&gt;Strauss. "In the United States, hobby organizations participate in the public reenactment of historical events. The most popular is Civil War reenacting, which can be viewed as a manifestation of the unresolved nature of that war&amp;nbsp;... Among reenactors, the quest for historical authenticity is considered a core value."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanton. p 34&lt;/ref&gt;  (It should be noted that these definitions and categorisation is primarily that of the USA.  Other countries have different terms of art, [[slang]], and definitions)

====Farbs====
{{main|Farb (reenactment)}}
"[[Farb (reenactment)|Farb]]s" or "polyester soldiers",&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 209 and p 219&lt;/ref&gt; are reenactors who spend relatively little  time and/or money achieving authenticity with regard to uniforms, accessories, or period behavior. Anachronistic clothing, fabrics, fasteners (such as [[velcro]]), [[Snood (headgear)|snoods]], [[footwear]], vehicles, and modern cigarettes are common.	
	
The origin of the word "farb" (and the derivative adjective "farby") is unknown, though it appears to date to early [[American Civil War]] centennial reenactments in 1960 or 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 8. "Ross M. Kimmel states that it was used at the Manassas reenactment in 1961&amp;nbsp;... George Gorman and his 2nd North Carolina picked up the term at the First Manassas Reenactment in 1961 and enjoyed using it constantly with condescension and sarcasm directed toward other units."&lt;/ref&gt; Some think that the word derives from a truncated version of "Far be it from authentic".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://wesclark.com/jw/hodge.html |title=They Don Period's Clothes, Eat Era's Grub and Sneer At Less-Exacting Brethern |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=1994-06-02 |accessdate=2011-01-03 |last=Horwitz |first=Tony |quote=Some also refuse to fight beside those whose uniforms and performance art don't measure up: a group derided as "farbs," {{Sic|hide=y|short|-hand}} for "far-be-it-from-authentic."}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative definition is "Far Be it for me to question/criticise",&lt;ref name="Hadden 8"&gt;Hadden, p 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wesclark.com/jw/forigin.html Wesclark.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or "Fast And Researchless Buying".&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 8 ''Juanita Leisch calls it "Fast And Researchless Buying," and other sources insist it came from the Bicentennial and Revolutionary War groups and means "Fairly Authentic Royal British."''&lt;/ref&gt; A humorous definition of "farb" is "F.A.R.B: Forget About Research, Baby". Some early reenactors assert the word derives from German ''Farbe'', color, because inauthentic reenactors were over-colorful compared with the dull blues, greys or browns of the real Civil War uniforms that were the principal concern of American reenactors at the time the word was coined.&lt;ref name="Hadden 8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-far1.htm Worldwidewords.org]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Burton K. Kummerow, a member of "The Black Hats, CSA" reenactment group in the early 1960s, he first heard it used as a form of fake German to describe a fellow reenactor. The term was picked up by George Gorman of the 2nd North Carolina at the Centennial Manassas Reenactment in 1961, and has been used by reenactors since.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, pp.&amp;nbsp;219–220&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mainstream====
Mainstream reenactors make an effort to appear authentic, but may come out of character in the absence of an audience. Visible stitches are likely to be sewn in a period-correct manner, but hidden stitches and undergarments may not be period-appropriate. Food consumed before an audience is likely to be generally appropriate to the period, but it may not be seasonally and locally appropriate. Modern items are sometimes used "after hours" or in a hidden fashion. The common attitude is to put on a good show, but that accuracy need only go as far as others can see.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
{{anchor|Progressive}}

====Progressive====
At the other extreme from farbs are "hard-core authentics", or "progressives," as they sometimes prefer to be called.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 138&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes derisively called "stitch counters",&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 224&lt;/ref&gt; "(t)he hard-core movement is often misunderstood and sometimes maligned."&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, p 138 &lt;/ref&gt;

Hard-core reenactors generally value thorough research, and sometimes deride mainstream reenactors for perpetuating inaccurate "reenactorisms". They generally seek an "immersive" reenacting experience, trying to live, as much as possible, as someone of the period might have done. This includes eating seasonally and regionally appropriate food, sewing inside seams and undergarments in a period-appropriate manner, and staying in character throughout an event.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p. 138 "Like soldiers of the Civil War, progressives experience the same poor conditions that the original soldiers did, camping without tents and sleeping out exposed to the cold and rain. They spend weekends eating bad and insufficient food, and they practice a steady regimen of work, marching, and drill. They suffer the cold, carrying insufficient clothing and blankets as well as sleeping campaign-style by spooning with each other for warmth."&lt;/ref&gt; The desire for an immersive experience often leads hard-core reenactors to smaller events, or to setting up separate camps at larger events.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Period==
[[Image:Buckskins.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Mountain man]] reenactor displaying [[buckskins]]]]
The ''period'' of an event is the range of dates. See [[authenticity (reenactment)]] for a discussion of how the period affects the types of costume, weapons, and armour used.

Popular periods to reenact include:
* [[Classical reenactment]]
* [[Dark Ages reenactment]]
* [[Medieval reenactment]]
* [[Renaissance reenactment]] (including [[English Civil War reenactment]])

==Clothing and equipment==
[[Image:CompanyOfStGeorgeCamp2006.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Company of Saynt George|The Company of St. George]] recreating a small medieval military camp in France, 2006.]]
Numerous cottage industries abound that provide not only the materials but even the finished product for use by reenactors. Uniforms and clothing made of hand woven, natural dyed materials are sewn by hand or machine using the sartorial techniques of the period portrayed.

Detailed attention to authenticity in design and construction is given equally as well to headgear, footwear, eyewear, camp gear, accoutrements, military equipment, weapons and so on. These items (which are generally much more expensive than clothing and uniform in modern production) offer the wearer a lifelike experience in the use of materials, tailoring and manufacturing techniques that are as close to authentic as possible.

Event spectators may derive more satisfaction from attending reenactments when a high level of authenticity is attained in both individual clothing and equipment, as well as equipment used in camp.

===Living history===

{{Main|Living history}}
The term 'living history' describes the performance of bringing history to life for the general public in a manner that in most cases is not following a planned script. Historical presentation includes a continuum from well researched attempts to recreate a known historical event for educational purposes, through representations with theatrical elements, to competitive events for purposes of entertainment. The line between amateur and professional presentations at [[living history museum]]s can be blurred. While the latter routinely use museum professionals and trained interpreters to help convey the story of history to the public, some museums and historic sites employ living history groups with high standards of authenticity for the same role at special events.

Living histories are usually meant for education of the public. Such events do not necessarily have a mock battle but instead are aimed at portraying the life, and more importantly the lifestyle, of people of the period. This often includes both military and civilian impressions. Occasionally, storytelling or acting sketches take place to involve or explain the everyday life or military activity to the viewing public. More common are craft and cooking demonstrations, song and leisure activities, and lectures. Combat training or duels can also be encountered even when larger combat demonstrations are not present.

In the United States, The [[National Park Service]] land; NPS policy "does not allow for battle reenactments (simulated combat with opposing lines and casualties) on NPS property.  There are exceptions i.e. Saylors Creek, Gettysburg.  These are HIGHLY controlled with exacting safety factors, as well as, exacting historial truths"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wilson's Creek National Battlefield FAQ | date=25 July 2008 | publisher=National Park Service | url=http://www.nps.gov/wicr/faqs.htm .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]] medieval reenactment is usually associated with living history and renaissance faires and festivals as e.g. the Peter and Paul festival in [[Bretten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landsknechte-bretten.de/galerie/der-tross-1-tag/ Der Tross 10. – 14. Juni 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Schloss Kaltenberg]] knights tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ritterturnier.de/ Kaltenberg web entry]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of combat reenactment groups are battlefield reenactment groups, some of which have become isolated to some degree because of a strong focus on authenticity. The specific German approach of [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] is less about replaying a certain event, but to allow an immersion in a certain [[era]], to catch, in the sense of [[Walter Benjamin]] the 'spiritual message expressed in every monument's and every site's own "trace" and "aura"', even in the [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|Age of Mechanical Reproduction]].&lt;ref name= MP/&gt; Historic city festivals and events are quite important to build up local communities and contribute to the self-image of municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;Benita Luckmann: Bretten, Politik in einer deutschen Kleinstadt. Enke, Stuttgart 1970, {{ISBN|3-432-01618-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Events in monuments or on historical sites are less about the events related to them but serve as [[staffage]] for the immersion experience.&lt;ref name= MP&gt;Michael Petzet: "ln the full richness of their authenticity" - The Test of Authenticity and the New Cult of Monuments, Nara Conference on Authenticity in Relation to the World Heritage 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In Denmark several [[open air museum]]s uses living history as a part of their concept. These include [[Middelaldercentret]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middelaldercentret.dk/Engelsk/themedievaltown.html The Medieval Town]. [[Middelaldercentret]]. Accessed 9 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Old Town, Aarhus]] and [[Frilandsmuseet]].

===Combat demonstration===
Combat demonstrations are mock battles put on by reenacting organizations and/or private parties primarily to show the public what combat in the period might have been like. Combat demonstrations are only loosely based on actual battles, if at all, and may simply consist of demonstrations of basic tactics and maneuvering techniques.

[[Image:Pike Charge Battle of Maidstone Military Odyssey.jpg|thumb|right|[[Battle of Maidstone]] Reenactment, [[Kent]] (2011)]]

===Battle reenactment===
Scripted battles are reenactments in the strictest sense; the battles are planned out beforehand so that the companies and regiments make the same actions that were taken in the original battles.

They are often fought at or near the original battle ground or at a place very similar to the original. These demonstrations vary widely in size from a few hundred fighters to several thousand, as do the arenas used (getting the right balance can often make or break the spectacle for the public).

===Tactical combat===
{{Main|Tactical event}}
Tactical battles are generally not open to the public. Tactical battles are fought like real battles with both sides coming up with strategies and tactics to beat their opponents. With no script, a basic set of agreed-upon rules (physical boundaries, time limit, victory conditions, etc.), and on-site judges, tactical battles can be considered a form of [[Live action role-playing game]], but, in the cases where firearms are used, with real weapons firing blank ammunition (depending on gun control ordinances).

Tactical reenactment is one of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism activities | activities]] done by the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], which hosts tournaments using practice (not damaging) versions of medieval and renaissance weapons.

===Commercial reenactment===
{{See also|List of tourist attractions providing reenactment}}

Many castles, museums, and other historical tourist attractions employ actors or professional reenactors as part of the experience.  These usually address the recreation of a specific town, village, or activity within a certain time frame. Commercial reenactment shows are usually choreographed and follow a script.

Some locations have set up permanent [[authenticity (reenactment)|authentic]] displays. By their nature, these are usually [[living history]] presentations, rather than tactical or battle reenactment, although some host larger temporary events.{{clear left}}

In 2008 [[Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve]] and North Carolina's Tryon Palace staff and buildings provided the period backdrop for early 1800's life depicted in the "Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck" documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck" Documentary|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=nautilusproductions.com|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Many publications have covered historical reenactment and [[living history]]. Prominent among these are the ''Camp Chase Gazette'', ''Smoke and Fire News,'' and two different magazines named ''Living History'', and ''Skirmish Magazine''.

[[File:Preussische Soldaten exerzieren.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=260|left|Autumnal military exercise 1912 / Reenactment [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]], [[Konz]]]]

''The Medieval Soldier'' by [[Gerry Embleton]] and [[John Howe (illustrator)|John Howe]] (1995) is a popular book on the topic, which has been translated into French and German. It was followed by ''Medieval Military Costume in Colour Photographs''.

For the Napoleonic period, two books of interest cover life in the military at that time and living history: ''The Napoleonic Soldier'' by Stephen E. Maughan (1999) and ''Marching with Sharpe'' by B. J. Bluth (2001). Various Napoleonic reenactment groups cover the history of their associated regiments as well as try to describe and illustrate how they approach recreating the period. The goal to be as authentic as is possible has led many serious reenactment societies to set up their own research groups to verify their knowledge of the uniforms, drill and all aspects of the life that they strive to portray. In this way reenactment plays a vital role in bringing history to life, keeping history alive, and in expanding the knowledge and understanding of the period.

In the UK a number of small publishing houses have been established that particularly publish books about the English Civil War and more recently, of earlier periods as well. The largest are Stuart Press (with around 250 volumes in print) and Partizan Press.

Little has been published about reenactment in the mainstream market, except for press articles. One exception is the book ''I Believe in Yesterday: My Adventures in Living History'' by Tim Moore, which recounts his experiences trying out different periods of reenactment and the people he meets and things he learns whilst doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Tim (2008). ''I Believe in Yesterday: My Adventures in Living History''. London: Jonathan Cape. {{ISBN|0-224-07781-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media support==
Motion picture and television producers often turn to reenactment groups for support; films like ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'',&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{citation |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-10-09/features/1993282122_1_ted-turner-gettysburg-jeff-daniels |last=Jubera |first=Drew |title=GETTYSBURG: Ted Turner, a cast of thousands and the ghosts of the past |date=1993-10-09 |accessdate=2012-04-19 |work=[[Baltimore Sun]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/events/natm/glory.aspx AFI Night at the Movies]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]'',{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} and ''[[Alatriste]]''{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} benefited greatly from the input of reenactors, who arrived on set fully equipped and steeped in knowledge of military procedures, camp life, and tactics.

In a documentary about the making of the film ''Gettysburg'', actor [[Sam Elliott]], who portrayed Union General [[John Buford]] in the film, said of reenactors:

{{quote|text=I think we're really fortunate to have those people involved. In fact, they couldn't be making this picture without them; there's no question about that.  These guys come with their wardrobe, they come with their weaponry.  They come with all the accoutrements, but they also come with the stuff in their head and the stuff in their heart.&lt;ref&gt;This documentary can be found on the DVD of the film ''Gettysburg''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism==
[[Image:Wehrmacht re-enactors recreate the battle of Molotov Line in Sanok-Olchowce. (Poland) 2008. June 22.jpg|thumb|[[Wehrmacht]] reenactors recreate the battle of [[Molotov Line]] in [[Sanok]]-Olchowce.]]

Critics question the motivation of reenactors; some suggest concerns about the level of immersion found in some areas, notably those involving 20th century conflicts where combatants had stricter regulations regarding [[personal grooming]].&lt;!--what does this mean?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Jenny. ''Wargames: Inside the World of 20th Century Reenactors'' (Smithsonian Books, Washington, 2004). {{ISBN|1-58834-128-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average age of reenactors is generally far higher than the average age of soldiers in most conflicts. Few reenactment units discriminate based on age and physical condition.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, reenactors are overwhelmingly white and thus African-American characters, both enslaved and free, are underrepresented. (Hundreds of thousands of black Union soldiers served in the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Soldiers in the U.S. Military During the Civil War|url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/blacks-civil-war|website=National Archives|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In 2013, five black reenactors at the 150th anniversary event at Gettysburg constituted "the largest bloc of black civilians anyone had ever seen at an event whose historical basis was full of black civilians...Astonished spectators stopped them constantly, usually assuming they were portraying enslaved people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beery|first1=Zoë|title=Say Goodbye to Your Happy Plantation Narrative|url=https://theoutline.com/post/3956/cheyney-mcknight-not-your-mommas-history-profile|website=The Outline|accessdate=30 March 2018|date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson's book discusses the "fantasy [[farb (reenactment)|farb]]", or tendency of reenactors to gravitate towards "elite" units such as commandos, paratroopers, or [[Waffen-SS]] units. This results in under-representation in the reenactment community of what were the most common types of military troops in the period being reenacted. The question has arisen among North American reenactors, but similar issues exist in Europe. For example, in Britain, a high proportion of Napoleonic War reenactors perform as members of the [[95th Rifles]] (perhaps due to the popularity of the fictional character of [[Richard Sharpe (fictional character)|Richard Sharpe]]) and medieval groups have an over-proportion of plate-armoured soldiers.{{or|date=October 2016}} The UK has multi-period events such as "History in Action", where groups can see each other's appearance and performances, as well as perform for the general public. Weapons can be a concern in countries where weapons of most forms are legally banned or socially frowned on (such as in the UK).{{cn|date=October 2016}}

A final concern is that reenactors may be accused of being, or actually be, aligned with the political beliefs that some of the reenacted armies fought for, such as Nazism or the Confederate South. For example, U.S. politician [[Rich Iott]]{{'s}} participation in a [[World War II reenactment]] in which he was in the group that portrayed the German [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking]] side excited media criticism during his [[United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2010#District 9|2010 Congressional campaign]].&lt;ref name="Nazi uniform row"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11511574 |title=US Republican candidate Rich Iott in Nazi uniform row |date=2010-10-10 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, in the weeks following [[Unite the Right rally|a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia]] at which a neo-Nazi killed a counterprotester, some reenactors complained about &amp;mdash; as one reporter put it &amp;mdash; "the co-opting of the [Civil] war by neo-Nazis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guarino|first1=Mark|title=Will Civil War reenactments die out?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/will-civil-war-reenactments-die-out/2017/08/25/f43c6bc0-874b-11e7-a50f-e0d4e6ec070a_story.html|accessdate=30 March 2018|publisher=Washington Post|date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Homicide: Life on the Street''''' is an American [[police procedural]] television series chronicling the work of a fictional version of the [[Baltimore Police Department]]'s Homicide Unit. It ran for seven seasons (122 episodes) on [[NBC]] from 1993 to 1999, and was succeeded by ''[[Homicide: The Movie]]'', which also acted as the ''[[de facto]]'' series finale. The series was originally based on [[David Simon (writer)|David Simon]]'s book ''[[Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets]]''. Many of the characters and stories used throughout the show were based on events depicted in the book.

While ''Homicide'' featured an ensemble cast, [[Andre Braugher]] emerged as a breakout star through his portrayal of Detective [[Frank Pembleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bruce|last=Fretts|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,282863,00.html|title=The show that wouldn't die|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=1998-05-01|accessdate=2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show won [[TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Drama|Television Critics Association Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Drama]] in 1996, 1997, and 1998. It also became the first drama ever to win three [[Peabody Awards]] for drama in 1993, 1995, and 1997. It received recognition from the [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], [[Satellite Awards]], [[Image Awards]], [[Viewers for Quality Television]], [[GLAAD Media Awards]] and [[Young Artist Awards]].

==Overview==
''Homicide: Life on the Street'' was adapted from ''[[Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets]]'', a non-fiction book by ''[[The Baltimore Sun|Baltimore Sun]]'' reporter [[David Simon]], based on his experience following a [[Baltimore Police Department]] homicide unit. Simon, who became a consultant and producer with the series, said he was particularly interested in the demythification of the American detective. While detectives are typically portrayed as noble characters who care deeply about their victims, Simon believed real detectives regarded violence as a normal aspect of their jobs.&lt;ref name="AnatomyDoc"&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[David Simon|Simon, David]] |date=1998-11-04 | title=Anatomy of "Homicide: Life on the Street" | medium=Documentary | publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] | location=[[Baltimore]], Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon sent the book to film director and Baltimore native [[Barry Levinson]] with the hopes that it would be adapted into a film, but Levinson thought it would be more appropriate material for television because the stories and characters could be developed over a longer period of time. Levinson believed a television adaptation would bring a fresh and original edge to the police drama genre because the book exploded many of the myths of the police drama genre by highlighting that cops did not always get along with each other, and that criminals occasionally got away with their crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Homicide: Life on the Street: The Unofficial Companion |last=Kalat |first=David P. |year=1998 |publisher=[[Renaissance Books]] |location=Los Angeles, California |isbn=1-58063-021-9 |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levinson approached screenwriter [[Paul Attanasio]] with the material, and ''Homicide'' became Attanasio's first foray into television writing. Subsequently, all episodes of ''Homicide'' display the credit, "Created by Paul Attanasio" at the end of their opening sequence, a credit which both [[Eric Overmyer]] and [[James Yoshimura]] dispute on the DVD audio commentary to the season 5 episode, "The Documentary", claiming instead the show was created by [[Tom Fontana]] and Yoshimura. The series title was originally ''Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets'', but NBC changed it so that viewers would not believe it was limited to a single year; the network also believed the use of the term "life" would be more reaffirming than the term "killing streets". Levinson was indifferent to the change, asserting that viewers would probably casually refer to the series as "Homicide" in either case.&lt;ref name="LevinsonComm"&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[Barry Levinson|Levinson, Barry]] |date=2003|title=Homicide Life on the Street – The Seasons 1 &amp; 2 |format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD|publisher=[[A&amp;E Television Networks|A&amp;E Home Video]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening theme music was composed by Baltimore native Lynn F. Kowal, a graduate of the [[Peabody Institute]] of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

''Homicide'''s purpose was to provide its viewers with a no-nonsense, [[police procedural]]-type glimpse into the lives of a squad of inner-city detectives. As opposed to many television shows and movies involving cops, ''Homicide'' initially opted for a bleak sort of realism in its depiction of "The Job", portraying it as repetitive, spiritually draining, an [[Existentialism|existential]] threat to one's psyche, often glamour- and glory-free—but, nonetheless, a social necessity. In its attempt to do so, ''Homicide'' developed a trademark feel and look that distinguished itself from its contemporaries. For example, the series was filmed with hand-held 16&amp;nbsp;mm cameras almost entirely [[Filming location|on-location]] in [[Baltimore]] (making the idiosyncratic city something of a character itself). It also regularly used music montages, [[jump cut]] editing, and the three-times-in-a-row repetition of the same camera shot during particularly crucial moments in the story. The episodes were also noted for interweaving as many as three or four storylines in a single episode. NBC executives often asked the writers to focus on a single homicide case rather than multiple ones, but the show producers tended to resist this advice.&lt;ref name="LevinsonComm" /&gt;

Despite premiering in the coveted post-[[Super Bowl]] time slot, the show opened to lackluster ratings, and cancellation was an immediate threat. However, the show's winning of two [[Emmy Awards]] (for Levinson's direction of "[[Gone for Goode]]" and Fontana's writing of "[[Three Men and Adena]]") and the success of another police drama—the more sensational ''[[NYPD Blue]]''—helped convince NBC to give it another chance beyond the truncated, nine-episode-long first season. ''Homicide'' consistently ranked behind [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'' and CBS's ''[[Nash Bridges]]'' in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. Despite the poor ratings, reviews were consistently strong from the beginning of the series. Commentators were especially impressed with the high number of strong, complex, well-developed and non-stereotypical African American characters like Pembleton, Lewis and Giardello.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[John Leonard (critic)|Leonard, John]] | date=1998-11-04 | title =Anatomy of "Homicide: Life on the Street" | medium =Documentary | publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] | location=[[Baltimore]], Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police department scenes were shot at the historic City Recreation Pier in the [[Fells Point, Baltimore|Fells Point]] neighborhood in Baltimore. Although NBC occasionally pressured the show's producers to write happy endings to the homicide cases, the network gave an unusual amount of freedom for the writers to create darker stories and non-traditional detective story elements, like unsolved cases where criminals escape.&lt;ref name="Documentary"&gt;{{Cite video | people=Bogosian, Theodore | date=1998-11-04 | title=Anatomy of "Homicide: Life on the Street" | medium=Documentary | publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] | location=[[Baltimore]], Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in its attempt to improve ''Homicide'''s ratings, NBC often insisted on changes, both cosmetic and thematic. For example, by the beginning of the third season, talented but unphotogenic veteran actor [[Jon Polito]] had been ordered dropped from the cast.

Considered by critics to be one of television's most authentic police dramas, as well as an excellent dramatic series propelled by a talented ensemble cast, ''Homicide'' garnered three straight TCA (Television Critics Association) Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Drama from 1996 to 1998 and was the first drama ever to win three of the prestigious [[Peabody Awards]] for best drama (1993, 1995, 1997).

The reality of ''Homicide'''s low Nielsen ratings hovered over all things, however, and always left the show in a precarious position; it also had a harder time gaining a large audience because fewer viewers are at home watching TV on Friday nights. Despite this, the network managed to keep what ''[[TV Guide]]'' referred to as "The Best Show You're Not Watching" on the air for five full seasons and seven seasons in all. In July 1997, NBC gave the series producers an ultimatum to make ''Homicide'' more popular than ''Nash Bridges'' or face cancellation. When this goal was not reached, the studio gave serious consideration to canceling the show, but a number of shocks at NBC increased ''Homicide''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s value. Among those factors were the loss of the popular series ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and the $850&amp;nbsp;million deal needed to keep ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' from leaving the network.&lt;ref name="Documentary" /&gt;

''Homicide'' was at one time [[television syndication|syndicated]] on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] and [[Court TV]] as well as the all-crime television cable station [[Cloo|Sleuth]], and airs occasionally on [[WGN America]]. Episodes of ''Homicide'' have aired on [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] as part of several [[fictional crossover|crossover]]s the series had with ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', which TNT owns broadcast rights for; in these cases both crossover episodes aired back to back. It was recently televised on the [[BET Her|Centric]] channel.

All seven seasons are available on DVD. One DVD set combines the first two seasons. Additional sets contain the complete third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons. A boxed set shaped like a filing cabinet features an additional disc containing the ''Homicide'' TV movie and the relevant ''Law &amp; Order'' crossover episodes – those without this disc had to rely on ''Law &amp; Order'' recap clips on the season DVDs. Significantly, the DVDs contain the episodes in the producers' intended order, not the order in which NBC aired them.

The show has spawned changes in the real life Baltimore homicide unit. As seen in the show, the unit originally used a [[dry-erase board]] in order to visually track detectives' progress at solving crimes. After the show began to air, the [[Baltimore Police Department]] discontinued the practice, believing the board, which concentrated on "clearance rates" for crimes, had a negative impact on publicity. It was brought back later at the insistence of the detectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://members.aol.com/jimking/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050316224059/http://members.aol.com/jimking/ |archivedate=2005-03-16 | title = Homicide: Life on the Street, The Board | accessdate = 2008-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 3===
{{Main|Homicide: Life on the Street (season 3)}}
The third season saw the first changes in the character lineup; when Detective Steve Crosetti (Jon Polito) was not seen in any episodes, his body was found in a death by suicide in the sixth episode of the season. [[Isabella Hofmann]] joined the cast as Lieutenant Megan Russert, the commander of the other Homicide shift, it also dealt with her promotion to Captain, and saw the last appearances of Felton and Bolander (Daniel Baldwin, Ned Beatty).

===Seasons 4 and 5===
{{Main|Homicide: Life on the Street (season 4)|Homicide: Life on the Street (season 5)}}
The fourth season saw the departure of Daniel Baldwin and Ned Beatty, who played [[Beau Felton]] and [[Stan Bolander]] respectively. In the story, the two detectives had recently been given a 22 week suspension, as related in the opening scene of the season's first episode. Bolander went on to retirement, and Felton, recruited for deep undercover work, was killed (off-screen) in the line of duty during the fifth season. The characters returned in the movie.
This season also sees Mike Kellerman (Reed Diamond) join the cast. Isabella Hofmann (newly demoted, Detective Megan Russert) left at the end of Season 4, but returned in the Season 5 finale, in which she, Kay Howard (Melissa Leo) and J.H. Brodie (Max Perlich) made their last appearances. 
Season 5 also saw the addition of Chief Medical Examiner Julianna Cox (Michelle Forbes) and Detective Terri Stivers (Toni Lewis).

===Season 6===
{{Main|Homicide: Life on the Street (season 6)}}
The sixth season was the first not to feature Leo as Sergeant Kay Howard, and the last to feature Braugher as Detective Frank Pembleton and Forbes as Chief Medical Examiner Julianna Cox. Jon Seda, Callie Thorne and Peter Gerety joined the cast as Detectives Paul Falsone, Laura Ballard and Stuart Gharty. J.H. Brodie (Max Perlich) is no longer present, nor is Detective Meg Russert (Isabella Hofmann).

===Season 7===
{{Main|Homicide: Life on the Street (season 7)}}
Following the events of the sixth season finale, Detective Frank Pembleton (Braugher) and Detective Mike Kellerman (Diamond) are no longer regulars; neither is Chief Medical Examiner Julianna Cox (Forbes), who left mid-season. Braugher and Forbes did not return until the movie, while Diamond made a two-episode guest appearance. Michael Michele stars in this season as Det. Rene Sheppard and Giancarlo Esposito is cast as Giardello's son Mike, who is assigned to Homicide as an FBI Liaison.

===''Homicide: The Movie''===
{{Main|Homicide: The Movie}}
In 2000, following the conclusion of the series, a TV film titled ''[[Homicide: The Movie]]'' was shown on NBC. The squad's former Lieutenant, Al Giardello, was running for mayor on a controversial pro-drug-legalization platform, and is close to victory when he is gunned down. The assassination attempt inspires the return of the entire unit, past and present, in an effort to apprehend the gunman.

==Crossovers==
''Homicide: Life on the Street'' executive producer [[Tom Fontana]] and ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' creator [[Dick Wolf]] became [[Tom Fontana#Membership|close friends]] in the 1980s while working as writers in the same building, at the same time, on the series ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' (Fontana) and ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' (Wolf).&lt;ref name=Crossovers&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/dick-wolf |title=Dick Wolf Interview |work=[[Archive of American Television]] |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Foundation]] |date=2003-04-21 |accessdate=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the two friends decided to do a small crossover between their (then) current shows, with ''Law &amp; Order'' [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] Detective [[Mike Logan (Law &amp; Order)|Mike Logan]] ([[Chris Noth]]) delivering a fugitive to ''Homicide: Life on the Street''{{'}}s BPD Detective Frank Pembleton during the prologue of the season 3 episode "[[Law &amp; Disorder]]".

The concept proved popular with fans and with both Fontana and Wolf.&lt;ref name=Crossovers/&gt; As of the 2015–2016 television season, this first crossover by Wolf has been followed by 15 other [[Law &amp; Order (franchise)#Crossovers|crossover stories]] in his numerous ''[[Law &amp; Order (franchise)|Law &amp; Order]]'' and ''[[Chicago (franchise)|Chicago]]'' franchises. Fontana expanded the ''Homicide: Life on the Street'' crossovers to include characters from ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'', years after that series had ended its run.  Wolf would adopt the same post-cancellation crossover concept when ''Homicide: Life on the Street'' characters Meldrick Lewis and Billie Lou Hatfield (Ellen McElduff) appeared, 14 years after their series ended, at John Munch's retirement party from the NYPD on the ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' episode "[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 15)#ep324|Wonderland Story]]".

[[Jason Priestley]] joined the cast in the climactic television movie, during which his character referred to Pembleton and Bayliss as "legends". Typically, well-known actors making guest appearances on ''Homicide'' were cast in fully developed roles central to the episode in which they appeared. [[Robin Williams]]'s portrayal of a grieving widower and father in the second-season, "Bop Gun", is a notable example, as is [[Steve Buscemi]]'s role as a suspected gunman in the third-season "End Game."

Some celebrities made cameo appearances that were more lighthearted in style. Director (and Baltimore native) [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]—who called the show "the grittiest, best-acted, coolest-looking show on TV"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Artforum International|date=October 1, 1998|title=John Waters' top ten}}&lt;/ref&gt;—appeared twice, once as a nameless bartender listening to a disconsolate Detective Bolander, and another time as a talkative prisoner transferred from New York to Baltimore by [[Mike Logan (Law &amp; Order)|Det. Mike Logan]] (played by [[Chris Noth]]). Waters and Noth received "special thanks" in the episode's closing credits. Out traveling on his motorcycle, [[Jay Leno]] stopped in at the Waterfront to have a soft drink, quickly departing after finding his bartenders strangely silent. In one particularly self-referential episode, journalist [[Tim Russert]] appeared as himself, bickering about birthday presents with his "cousin", Lieutenant Megan Russert. Film director [[Barry Levinson]], who also executive produced ''Homicide'', acted as himself directing an episode for a show-within-a-show called ''Homicide'' in the episode, "The Documentary".

The Mayor of Baltimore ([[Kurt Schmoke]]) and the Governor of Maryland ([[Parris Glendening]]) made brief appearances in the episode about the death of Beau Felton, appearing at the memorial press conference for Felton's death in the line of duty.

Recurring characters of particular note include the Mahoney crime family. Luther Mahoney, played by [[Erik Dellums]], appears in seasons four and five. Mahoney is a crime and drug kingpin who uses others to do his dirty work and masterfully manipulates the law to repeatedly escape conviction and hide his connection to the crimes committed by his underlings. At first, he is depicted as an almost friendly rival, with both Mahoney and the police mutually amused by Mahoney's antics. Gradually, however, the police—particularly Kellerman and Lewis—grow frustrated with Mahoney, until Lewis viciously beats him during an arrest, and Kellerman fatally shoots Mahoney under questionable circumstances.

In the following season, the Mahoney organization is taken over by Luther's sister Georgia Rae, played by [[Hazelle Goodman]], who seeks both legal and illegal revenge against the Baltimore Police Department.

[[Mekhi Phifer]] makes several appearances as Junior Bunk, a dim-witted street thug who is initially depicted as someone with the potential to go straight. His crimes grow increasingly violent, however, and in his final appearance he is revealed to be Georgia Rae's son, with the real name "Nathaniel Lee Mahoney". Junior's final appearance takes place after the character has been hardened by jail time, and the once minor criminal deals the homicide department a major blow with a multiple shooting in the police station, killing three uniformed cops (extras) and injuring two of the main characters. In retaliation, the police declare all-out war on the Mahoney crime organization. Several cops, including Bayliss, are injured, and several criminals, including Georgia Rae, are killed as a result; in addition, both Pembleton and Kellerman turn in their badges.

'''''Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief''''' was a [[charitable organization|charity]] [[telethon]] held on January 22, 2010 from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|Eastern Standard Time]] (January 23, 2010 from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. [[Universal Coordinated Time|UTC]]). The telethon was the most widely distributed telethon in history.&lt;ref name=tvtonight&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Airdate: Hope for Haiti Now|url=http://tvtonight.com.au/2010/01/airdate-hope-for-haiti-now.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=January 22, 2010|accessdate=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was broadcast from Studio 36 at [[CBS Television City]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in [[Queens, New York]] and a private club, [[The Hospital (club)|The Hospital]], in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Rodrigo and Rogers, Georgie, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20100122_hopeforhaiti.shtml "U2, Jay Z and Rihanna team up to perform a special benefit track"], ''[[BBC 6 Music]]'', January 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chittenden, Maurice and Hastings, Chris, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6999966.ece "Haiti earthquake concert raises £35m"], ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', January 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; There were also live reports from [[Haiti]].

Initial plans for the telethon were announced by [[MTV Networks]] on January 15, 2010, three days after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] struck on January 12 that is assumed to have claimed the lives of about 200,000 people. The event was one of a number of [[Humanitarian response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake|humanitarian responses to the earthquake]]. Processing of the telethon's donations was in the hands of the [[Entertainment Industry Foundation]].&lt;ref name="hfhn"/&gt; The telethon was patterned after the form begun with the 2001 ''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'' program and continued with the 2005 ''[[Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast]]''.

Funds raised by the telethon and from the sale of its [[Hope for Haiti Now (album)|album]] and video – immediately made available for pre-order on [[iTunes]] – are to be distributed to seven non-profit organizations doing relief work in Haiti.&lt;ref name="hfhn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hopeforhaitinow.org/FAQ.asp |title=FAQs |accessdate=January 22, 2010 |publisher=Hope for Haiti Now }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audience and proceeds raised==
The event drew an estimated audience of 83 million viewers in the United States between the initial broadcast and web and mobile streams throughout the weekend.&lt;ref name=MTVNews100125&gt;Kaufman, Gil et al. [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1630468/20100125/jean_wyclef.jhtml {{" '}}Hope For Haiti Now' Draws 83 Million Viewers In U.S."], ''[[MTV News]]'', January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, it was reported that the telethon had raised over {{US$}}58&amp;nbsp;million, not including corporate and large private donors or sales of the album and video. The amount is a record for donations by the general public to a telethon for disaster-relief.&lt;ref name=MTVNews100123&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1630365/20100122/rihanna.jhtml {{" '}}Hope For Haiti Now' Sets New Record For Money Raised By Disaster-Relief Telethon"], ''[[MTV News]]'', January 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On January 25 the figure was revised to $61 million.&lt;ref name="MTVNews100125"/&gt;

Viewers were encouraged to donate online, calling toll-free (1-877-99-HAITI), by texting or by mail. Donations were accepted up to six months after the broadcast.&lt;ref name="MTVNews100125"/&gt;

==Participants==
[[Wyclef Jean]] hosted the concert in [[New York City]], with [[George Clooney]] in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Anderson Cooper]] in [[Haiti]].&lt;ref name="usatoday-clooneyexplains"/&gt;

[[Rihanna]] revealed on 21 January that she would perform a new song titled "[[Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)]]", together with [[Jay-Z]] and [[U2]]'s [[The Edge]] and [[Bono]] for the telethon in London.&lt;ref name="Stranded"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rihanna to perform 'Stranded' in Haiti telethon | work=[[Yahoo!

===Appearance order===
The telethon began and ended with images of victims in Haiti. Presented in a format similar to 2001's ''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'', the intervening two hours consisted of musical performances with speeches, reports from Haiti, and conversations between celebrity operators and donors calling in.

Times in the table are given from the beginning of the show (8 p.m. [[Eastern time zone|U.S. ET]]/1 a.m. [[UTC]]) and are based on the CBS airing in the US.

[[Image:Iproniazid.svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Iproniazid]], the first hydrazine MAOI to be discovered.]]

The '''[[hydrazine]]''' [[antidepressant]]s are a group of non-selective, [[irreversible inhibition|irreversible]] [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs) which were discovered and initially marketed in the 1950s and 1960s. Most have been withdrawn due to [[toxicity]], namely [[hepatotoxicity]], but a few still remain in clinical use.

[[Tranylcypromine]], a structurally unrelated MAOI introduced around the same time as the hydrazines, was originally advertised as ''non-hydrazine'' as a result of its diminished propensity for causing hepatotoxicity.

During the gold rush, the mountain was the site of large-scale gold mining and excavation. After the largest sources of gold ore were exhausted, small family-owned operations moved into the area and continue mining gold on and near the mountain today.&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; A communications tower is located atop the mountain, and in 2001, the tower was the site of a fatal accident.&lt;ref&gt;Human Resources and Skills Development Canada.

Accessed March 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The trail for the [[Yukon Quest]] 1,000-mile sled dog race passes over the mountain every February.

The mountain is in a [[subarctic]] climate region, and is covered by an average snowpack of {{convert|29|in|cm|0}} during March and April.&lt;ref&gt;Alaska Snow, Water, and Climate Services.

'''Luka Rocco Magnotta''' (born '''Eric Clinton Kirk Newman'''; July 24, 1982) is a Canadian murderer who was convicted of killing and dismembering Lin Jun, a Chinese [[international student]], before mailing Jun's hands and feet to elementary schools and federal political party offices.{{r|rewind}} This act gained international notoriety. After a video depicting the murder was posted online in May 2012, Magnotta fled Canada, becoming the subject of an [[Interpol Red Notice]] and prompting an international [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]]. In June 2012, he was apprehended at an [[Internet café]] in [[Berlin]] while reading news about himself.{{r|rewind}} In December 2014, after eight days of deliberations, a jury convicted him of first-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/12/23/luka_magnotta_is_convicted_of_firstdegree_murder.html#|title=Luka Magnotta is convicted of first-degree murder|work=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was previously sought by [[animal rights]] groups for uploading videos of himself killing [[kitten]]s.{{r|5th}}

==Biography==
===Early life===
Magnotta was born Eric Clinton Kirk Newman{{r|CBC_timeline}} on July 24, 1982, in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough, Ontario]] to Anna Yourkin and Donald Newman, one of three children. According to him, his mother was obsessed with cleanliness, would routinely lock her children out of the house, and once put her children's pet rabbits out in the cold to freeze to death. His father was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1994,&lt;ref name="mongazpsych"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Montgomery |first1=Sue |title=Psychiatrist's report chronicles the making of Luka Magnotta |url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/psychiatrists-report-chronicles-the-making-of-luka-magnotta |website=Montreal Gazette |accessdate=29 September 2018 |date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he divorced his wife, leading to Magnotta later moving in with his grandmother, Phyllis.{{r|CBC_timeline}} Both his grandmother and younger brother, Conrad, would often call him "faggot" for his effeminate tendencies.

He attended [[I. E. Weldon Secondary School]] in [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]].{{r|CBC_timeline}}

In 2003, he began to appear in [[pornography|pornographic]] videos, occasionally working as a [[stripper]] and a [[male escort]].{{r|CBC_timeline|MSN_interview}} He appeared as a pin-up model in a 2005 issue of Toronto's ''[[fab (magazine)|fab]]'' magazine using the pseudonym "Jimmy".{{r|Xtra_Jimmy}} In 2007, he was an unsuccessful competitor in [[OutTV (Canada)|OUTtv]]'s reality series ''[[COVERguy]]''.{{r|TS_audition|Sun_Coverguy|Xtra_details}} Magnotta had multiple [[Cosmetic surgery|cosmetic surgeries]] and auditioned for the [[Slice (TV channel)|Slice network]] television show ''Plastic Makes Perfect'' in February 2008.{{r|Shaw_Plastic}}

===Early criminal activity===
In 2005, he was convicted of one count of impersonation and three counts of fraud (against [[Sears Canada]], [[The Brick]], and 2001 Audio Video) after impersonating a woman to apply for a credit card and purchasing over $10,000 worth of goods. He pleaded guilty and received a nine-month [[Conditional sentence (Canada)|conditional sentence]] with 12 months of probation.{{r|GM_glimpse|CBC_timeline}} He legally [[Name change|changed his name]] to Luka Rocco Magnotta on August 12, 2006.{{r|CBC_whois}} Magnotta declared [[bankruptcy]] in March 2007, owing $17,000 in various debts.{{r|VS_bankruptcy|CTV_whois}} The bankruptcy was fully discharged in December 2007.{{r|VS_bankruptcy}}

Magnotta created many profiles on various Internet [[social media]] and [[Internet forum|discussion forums]] over several years to plant a variety of claims about himself.{{r|CBC_whois|CTV_whois}} One such rumor emerged in 2007, claiming Magnotta was in a relationship with [[Karla Homolka]], a high-profile Canadian convicted murderer, though he denied this in a subsequent interview with the ''[[Toronto Sun]]''.{{r|Macleans_Homolka|Sun_Homolka|Warmington-2012-05-31}} During the murder investigation, Montreal police initially announced the pair had dated but soon retracted the statement and acknowledged that they had no evidence to corroborate the claim.{{r|Macleans_Homolka}} As with the Homolka relationship, Magnotta repeatedly denied the claims he himself had planted as hoaxes and part of a campaign of [[cyberstalking|cyber stalking]] against him.{{r|CBC_whois}} Police stated that Magnotta set up at least 70 [[Facebook]] pages and 20 websites under different names.{{r|Macleans_FB}} According to the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], Magnotta posted on the white supremacist website [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] under two different usernames, and had followed the Twitter account of white nationalist [[Don Black (white nationalist)|Don Black]]. In one of his alleged Stormfront comments, Magnotta denounced Chinese people.&lt;ref name="splc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2014/summer/White-Homicide-Worldwide|title=White Homicide Worldwide|last=Beirich|first=Heidi|date=Summer 2014|work=Intelligence Report,|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of Lin Jun==
Lin Jun ({{zh|c=林俊|p=Lín Jùn}}) (30 December 1978 – 24/25 May 2012), also known as Justin Lin, was an [[international student]] from [[Wuhan]] and an undergraduate in the engineering and computer science faculty at [[Concordia University]].{{r|CBC_id}} He worked part-time as a convenience store clerk in [[Pointe-Saint-Charles]].{{r|TS_denial}} Lin had been studying in [[Montreal]] since July 2011.{{r|CBC_id}} Lin moved into a [[Griffintown]]-area apartment with a roommate on May 1.{{r|CBC_id}} He was last seen on May 24, 2012, and his friends reported getting a text message from his phone at 9 pm.{{r|TS_denial}} His boss became suspicious when he didn't show up for his shift the next day.{{r|CBC_friends|CN_shift}} Three of his friends went into his apartment on May 27.{{r|TS_denial|CTV_id|CN_shift}} He was reported missing to police on May 29.{{r|CBC_id|CTV_id}}

On May 25, 2012, an 11-minute video titled ''1 Lunatic 1 Ice Pick'' was uploaded to [[Bestgore.com]], depicting a naked male tied to a bed frame being repeatedly stabbed with an [[ice pick]] and a kitchen knife, then [[dismemberment|dismembered]], followed by acts of [[necrophilia]].{{r|NP_video|TS_gore}} The perpetrator uses a knife and fork to cut off some of the flesh and gets a dog to chew on the body.{{r|NP_video|DB_nom}} During the video, the 1987 [[New Order (band)|New Order]] song "[[True Faith (song)|True Faith]]" plays in the background,{{r|NP_video}} and a poster for the 1942 film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' is visible on the wall.{{r|TS_horror}} Canadian authorities obtained a "more extensive" version of the video and said [[cannibalism]] may have been performed.{{r|TS_schools|MG_nom}} Materials promoting the video appeared online 10 days before the murder took place.{{r|OC_refs|NP_promo}}

On May 26, an attorney from [[Montana]] attempted to report the video to [[Toronto Police Service|Toronto Police]], his local [[Sheriffs in the United States|Sheriff]], and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], but the report was dismissed by officials.{{r|CBC_report|TS_video}} Bestgore viewers also attempted to report the video.{{r|CBC_bestgore}} Police later confirmed it as authentic and identified the victim, an Asian male, as the same one whose body parts were sent to Ottawa.{{r|GM_apt}}

At 11 am on May 29, 2012, a package containing a left foot was delivered to the national headquarters of the [[Conservative Party of Canada]].{{r|NP_manhunt}} The package was stained with blood and had a foul smell.{{r|NP_Byrne|CC_trauma}} It was marked with a red [[Heart (symbol)|heart]] symbol.{{r|GM_apt}} Another package containing a left hand was intercepted in a [[Canada Post]] processing facility, addressed to the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]].{{r|GM_apt}} A janitor discovered a decomposing [[torso]] inside a suitcase, left in a garbage pile in the alley behind an apartment building in the [[Snowdon, Montreal|Snowdon]] area of Montreal.{{r|NP_manhunt}} He first saw the suitcase on May 25, but it was not picked up due to the large amount of garbage that day.{{r|GM_apt}}

After searching the scene, police recovered human remains, bloody clothes, papers identifying the suspect, as well as "sharp and blunt objects" from the back alley.{{r|CBC_police2}} Footage from [[surveillance cameras]] inside the building showed a suspect bringing numerous garbage bags outside, and the images matched the suspect who was captured on video at the post office in [[Côte-des-Neiges]].{{r|CBC_police2}}

At 11:33 pm [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]] (03:33 [[UTC]]), police searched apartment 208 of the building, which Magnotta was renting.{{r|CBC_police2}} He had moved in four months prior, and his rent was paid up to June 1.{{r|TS_apt}} The apartment had been mostly emptied before he left.{{r|TS_apt}} Blood was found on different items including the mattress, the refrigerator, the table, and the bathtub.{{r|TS_apt}} "If you dont [sic] like the reflection. Dont [sic] look in the mirror. I dont [sic] care" was written in red ink on the inside of a closet.{{r|TS_apt}}

On May 30, 2012, it was confirmed that the body parts belonged to the same individual, later identified as Lin Jun.{{r|CTV_id}} The suspect in the case was quickly identified as Magnotta, who had by then fled.{{r|CTV_id}}

A note was found with the package sent to the Conservative Party, saying six body parts had been distributed and the perpetrator would kill again.{{r|CTV_note}} The other three packages also contained notes, but their contents were undisclosed by police, who cited their concerns about possible [[copycat crimes]].{{r|CBC_probe}}

On June 5, 2012, a package containing a right foot was delivered to [[St. George's School (Vancouver)|St. George's School]] and another package containing a right hand to [[False Creek Elementary School]] in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia.{{r|TS_schools|AP_schools}} Both schools opened as normal the following morning.{{r|VC_crisis|CBC_probe}} It was confirmed that both packages were sent from Montreal.{{r|CBC_probe}}

On June 13, the four limbs and the torso were matched to Lin using [[DNA profiling|DNA]] samples from his family.{{r|NP_match}} On July 1, his head was recovered at the edge of a small lake in Montreal's [[Angrignon Park]] after police received an anonymous tip.{{r|CTV_head}}

Lin's body was [[cremation|cremated]] on July 11 and his ashes were buried on July 26 at [[Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery]] in Montreal.{{r|CBC_funeral|MG_funeral|DM_funeral}}

==Manhunt==
An [[arrest warrant]] for Magnotta was issued by the [[Service de police de la Ville de Montréal]] (SPVM), later upgraded to a Canada-wide warrant{{r|RCMP}} by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP), accusing him of the following crimes:{{r|CBC_warrant}}
# [[Murder (Canadian law)#Murder|First-degree murder]];
# Committing an indignity to a dead body;
# Publishing obscene material;
# Mailing obscene, indecent, immoral or scurrilous material; and
# Criminally harassing Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] and several (unnamed) members of Parliament.

On May 31, 2012, [[Interpol]] issued a [[Red notice]] for Magnotta at the request of Canadian authorities, and for several days before and after his arrest his name and photo were displayed prominently at the top of the home page of the Interpol website. The Red Notice requested that Magnotta be provisionally arrested pending extradition back to Canada by any [[Interpol#Members|Interpol member state]].{{r|Interpol_2}}

Magnotta booked a ticket for a flight from Montreal to Paris on May 25, using a passport with his own name.&lt;ref name=passport&gt;{{cite news|last=Shivji|first=Salimah|title=Luka Magnotta trial hears from ex-PM's son and Karla Homolka's sister|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/luka-magnotta-trial-hears-from-ex-pm-s-son-and-karla-homolka-s-sister-1.2803849|accessdate=19 October 2014|work=CBC News |date=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his arrival in France, his cell phone signal was traced to a hotel in [[Bagnolet]], but he had left by the time police arrived.{{r|AFP_hotel}} Pornographic magazines and an air-sickness bag were found in the hotel room.{{r|AFP_hotel|CBC_coverage}} Magnotta used a false passport with the name "Kirk Trammel" at the hotel.&lt;ref name=hotel&gt;{{cite news|title=Luka Rocco Magnotta: Victim's family meets Montreal police|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/06/06/luka_rocco_magnotta_victims_family_meets_montreal_police.html|accessdate=19 October 2014|work=Thestar.com|date=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had contacts in Paris from a previous visit in 2010, and police were following a large-framed man who had been in contact with Magnotta.{{r|AP_schools}} Another man he stayed with for two nights did not realize who he was until he had left.{{r|AP_schools}} Magnotta then boarded a [[Eurolines]] bus at the Bagnolet coach station bound for [[Berlin]], Germany.{{r|AP_schools}}

On June 4, 2012, Magnotta was apprehended by [[Berlin Police]] at an [[Internet café]] in the [[Neukölln]] district while reading news stories about himself.{{r|CBC_arrest}} He tried giving fake names before admitting who he was.{{r|CBC_arrest}} His identity was confirmed through [[fingerprint]] evidence.{{r|CBC_arrest}} Magnotta appeared in a Berlin court on June 5, 2012.{{r|Reuters_German}} According to German officials, he did not oppose his extradition.{{r|Reuters_German}} There was sufficient evidence to keep him in custody until extradition,{{r|NP_match}} and he agreed to a simplified process.{{r|CBC_family}}

On June 18, 2012, Magnotta was delivered to Canadian authorities in Berlin and flown aboard a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] [[CC-150 Polaris]] to [[Mirabel International Airport]], north of Montreal. A military transport was reported by the government to be necessary due to safety concerns with using a commercial flight and potential legal difficulties if the plane was diverted to another country.{{r|CTV_flight}} He was placed into [[solitary confinement]] at the [[Rivière-des-Prairies, Quebec|Rivière-des-Prairies]] detention centre.{{r|Sun_isolation}}

==Immediate aftermath==
Reactions in China were highly critical, with some believing the murder was racially motivated.{{r|Y_C}} Some Chinese questioned public safety in Canada, as the killing was the second high-profile murder of a Chinese student there in slightly over a year.{{r|Y_C}} [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Foreign Affairs Minister]] [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]] called Chinese ambassador Zhang Junsai ({{lang|zh|章均赛}})&lt;!--Source for Chinese: https://web.archive.org/web/20120305175415/http://ca.china-embassy.org/chn/sgxxx/dsjlx/ / https://www.webcitation.org/6QMxA5dBh?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20120305175415/http://ca.china-embassy.org/chn/sgxxx/dsjlx/ --&gt; to convey his condolences.{{r|The Huffington Post}}

On June 4, 2012, Canadian [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] said he was pleased that the suspect was arrested and congratulated the police forces on their good work in apprehending him.{{r|CBC_arrest}} Interim [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] leader [[Bob Rae]] said that Canadians should mourn the victim rather than "in any way, shape or form" celebrate Magnotta's notoriety.{{r|CBC_arrest}}

Two days later, Lin Jun's family arrived at [[Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Trudeau Airport]] in Montreal.{{r|CBC_family|TS_family|VS_family}} The [[Chinese Students and Scholars Association]] of [[Concordia University]] established a fund to defray expenses incurred by Lin's family while in Canada and an award was created in his honor.{{r|Sun_unity|GM_fund|CBC_award}} A [[candlelight vigil]] was held in Montreal.{{r|GM_vigil|CTV_vigil}}

Magnotta was named [[Canadian Newsmaker of the Year]] by [[The Canadian Press]], which caused controversy.{{r|GM_newsmaker|newsmaker}}

On July 16, 2013, Edmonton police charged [[Bestgore.com]] owner Mark Marek with corrupting public morals, a rarely used [[obscenity]] charge, for posting the ''1 Lunatic 1 Ice Pick'' video online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/story/2013/07/17/edmonton-best-gore-marek-charged.html Gore site owner charged over video in Magnotta case] CBC News, July 17, 2013. Retrieved July 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 25, 2016, Marek changed his plea to guilty and was sentenced to a six-month conditional sentence after a joint submission from the Crown and defence. He had to serve half of the six-month sentence under house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Global News]]|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2474806/edmonton-gore-website-owner-on-trial-for-posting-magnotta-video/|title=Edmonton gore website owner sentenced for posting Magnotta video|date=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==

===Preliminary hearing===
On June 19, Magnotta appeared in court by [[videotelephony|video link]] to plead not guilty to all charges through his lawyer.{{r|AJ_plea}} On June 21, Magnotta appeared in person at a high-security Montreal courtroom to request a [[trial by jury]].{{r|Sun_jury}}

A [[preliminary hearing]] began on March 11, 2013. The evidence presented is subject to a [[publication ban]]. Magnotta's defence team requested the media and the public be barred entirely from the hearing; this was declined the next day.{{r|Reuters_public}} Lin Jun's father, Lin Diran, travelled from China to attend the hearing.{{r|Sun_father}} On March 13, one of Magnotta's lawyers resigned, due to a possible [[conflict of interest]].{{r|Gazette_conflict}} Expert witnesses testified, including a [[Forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]], a [[forensic toxicology|forensic toxicologist]], a [[forensic odontology|forensic odontologist]],{{r|Gazette_experts}} a [[bloodstain pattern analysis|bloodstain analyst]],{{r|Sun_blood}} [[data recovery]] specialists{{r|LP_three}} and an Internet investigations officer.{{r|OC_collapse}} The prosecution also displayed video evidence.{{r|LP_three}} Both Magnotta and Lin physically collapsed at separate times during the proceedings.{{r|Gazette_emo|Sun_blood|OC_collapse}}

On April 12, 2013, Magnotta was indicted on charges of first-degree murder, offering indignities to a human body, distributing obscene materials, using the postal service to distribute obscene materials, and criminal harassment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2013/04/12/luka-magnotta-preliminary-hearing-trial-decision.html | work=CBC News | title=Luka Magnotta to stand trial on 1st-degree murder – Montreal – CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial===
Magnotta elected to be tried by judge and jury.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; He pleaded not guilty, admitting to the acts of which he was accused but claiming [[diminished responsibility]] due to mental disorders. [[Crown Attorney]] Louis Bouthillier made his [[opening statement]] on September 29, 2014. [[Quebec Superior Court]] Justice Guy Cournoyer presided over the trial, which lasted 10 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CBCNews|title=Luka Magnotta guilty of 1st-degree murder in Jun Lin's slaying|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/luka-magnotta-guilty-of-1st-degree-murder-in-jun-lin-s-slaying-1.2875989|website=CBC News - Latest Canada, World, Entertainment, and Business News|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the opening day, he instructed jurors that Magnotta "admits the acts or the conducts underlying the crime for which he is charged. Your task will be to determine whether he committed the five offences with the required state of mind for each offence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/luka-magnotta-trial-hears-how-torso-found-in-trash-outside-apartment-1.2781112|title=Luka Magnotta trial hears how torso found in trash outside apartment|date=September 29, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six tools (a pair of scissors, two knives, a screwdriver, an oscillating saw and a hammer) were recovered outside Magnotta's apartment and analysed by ballistics expert Gilbert Desjardins. He said none could be definitively linked to the killing, and no skeletal marks suggested the screwdriver or scissors were used, but some were consistent with saw and knife or X-Acto blade injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/crown-s-last-in-person-witness-testifies-at-luka-magnotta-trial-1.2072934|title=Crown's last in-person witness testifies at Luka Magnotta trial|work=CTVNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, defence attorney Luc Leclair argued that Magnotta was in a psychotic state at the time of the crimes and couldn't be held responsible for his actions. The Crown prosecutor argued that the murder of Jun Lin was organized and premeditated and that Magnotta was "purposeful, mindful, ultra-organized and ultimately responsible for his actions."&lt;ref name=seq/&gt;

Magnotta chose not to testify during the trial.&lt;ref name=seq/&gt;

After a 12-week trial which included 10 weeks of hearing testimony, the jury of eight women and four men received final instructions from the trial judge on December 15, 2014, and was sequestered before beginning its deliberations the next day.&lt;ref name=seq&gt;{{cite news|title=Luka Magnotta trial: Jury now sequestered|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/luka-magnotta-trial-jury-now-sequestered-1.2871549|accessdate=December 15, 2014|work=CBC News|date=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On their eighth day of deliberation, they returned a verdict of guilty on all charges.&lt;ref name=convicted&gt;{{cite news|title=Luka Magnotta trial: Jury delivers guilty verdict in death of Jun Lin|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/luka-magnotta-trial-jury-delivers-guilty-verdict-in-death-of-jun-lin-1.2875989|accessdate=December 23, 2014|work=CBC News|date=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnotta will serve a mandatory life sentence and will be eligible for parole in 25 years. He was also sentenced to 19 years for other charges, to be served concurrently.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Winter (December 23, 2014).

Magnotta filed an appeal for the convictions to be annulled and new trial ordered. The appeal was filed with the Quebec Court of Appeal by Magnotta's defence counsel Luc Leclair, citing judicial error in jury instruction. The appeal further claimed that the "verdicts are unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence and the instructions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/luka-magnotta-files-appeal-of-murder-conviction-1.2918352 |title=Luka Magnotta files appeal of murder conviction |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=2015-01-19 |accessdate=2015-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnotta withdrew his appeal on February 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/luka-magnotta-withdraws-appeal-of-1st-degree-murder-conviction-1.2961348 |title=Luka Magnotta withdraws appeal of 1st-degree murder conviction |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=2015-02-18 |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his trial for murder, defence witnesses provided evidence that Luka Magnotta had been diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] as a teenager.&lt;ref name=MG&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Allison|title=Luka Magnotta diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, 2005 court document say|url=https://montrealgazette.com/Luka+Magnotta+diagnosed+with+paranoid+schizophrenia+2005+court+document+says/8189128/story.html|accessdate=23 April 2014|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defence expert Dr. Joel Watts testified that Magnotta showed signs of episodic schizophrenia (undifferentiated type), [[histrionic personality disorder]], borderline personality traits and [[paraphilia]] not otherwise specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brantfordexpositor.ca/2014/11/17/psychiatrist-downplays-e-mail-magnottas-sister-told-him-about|title=Magnotta in the mirror fails to faze defence psych|author=Daly, Brian|publisher=Brantford Expositor|date=November 17, 2014|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution revealed that Magnotta had been using illegal drugs during his teenage years which led to symptoms that mimicked schizophrenia and that Magnotta has been diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]] by Crown expert Dr. Joel Paris at Jewish General Hospital in Montreal in April 2012.&lt;ref name=SM&gt;{{cite news|last1=MONTGOMERY|first1=Sue|title=Psychiatrist's report chronicles the making of Luka Magnotta|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/psychiatrists-report-chronicles-the-making-of-luka-magnotta|accessdate=29 December 2014|publisher=Montreal Gazette|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=f1&gt;{{cite web|title=Luka Magnotta File|url=http://postimg.org/image/8s02w1u41/|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=f2&gt;{{cite web|title=Luka Magnotta File 2|url=http://postimg.org/image/4bdjsrm0r/|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Renée Roy, the forensic psychiatrist who has been treating Magnotta at Rivières-des-Prairies Detention Centre since November 2012, through his preliminary hearing and right up to the murder trial, diagnosed Magnotta with borderline personality disorder with histrionic features.&lt;ref name=RD&gt;{{cite news|last1=DiManno|first1=Rosie|title=DiManno: A strange trip through Luka Magnotta's medical history|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/11/03/dimanno_a_strange_trip_through_luka_magnottas_medical_history.html|accessdate=29 December 2014|publisher=The Toronto Star|date=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Gilles Chamberland, another Crown expert who was not able to interview Magnotta, diagnosed Magnotta with [[antisocial personality disorder|anti-social]], histrionic and [[narcissistic personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/national/its-not-his-illness-its-his-personality-magnotta-trial-told|title=It's not his illness, it's his personality, Magnotta trial told|author=Montgomery, Sue|publisher=Montreal Gazette|date=December 1, 2014|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of psychiatrists over the years noted that Magnotta displayed antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic traits.

==Investigation into other possible crimes==
Magnotta is alleged to be the person behind a series of videos of [[Cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]] involving cats which were posted to [[YouTube]] beginning in 2010, including one titled "1 boy 2 kittens" which showed a man deliberately suffocating two kittens with a vacuum cleaner.{{r|CC_kittens}} In January 2011 a private Facebook group identified Magnotta as the person in these videos;{{r|huffpobarbi}} animal rights activist groups subsequently offered a $5,000 reward for bringing him to justice.{{r|CBC_timeline}} In February 2011, Toronto police began investigating Magnotta in connection with the videos after receiving a complaint from the [[Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]{{r|GM_kittens}} The OSPCA also contacted the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] in England, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations|FBI]], and police in Montreal due to the suspect's extensive travels.{{r|GM_kittens}}

Alex West, a journalist for British tabloid newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', met Magnotta while he was living in London in 2011, following claims that he had made "Python Christmas", an online video showing a kitten being eaten alive by a [[Burmese python]].{{r|LS_look}} ''The Sun'' contacted [[Scotland Yard]], which denied that the python video incident had occurred within its jurisdiction, stating that the video had been "posted from somewhere in North America".{{r|LS_mirror}} Following his meeting with Magnotta, Alex West said he received a threatening email, which he believed was sent by Magnotta.{{r|Sun_AlexWest}}

On June 8, the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] announced they were in contact with Montreal police to determine if Magnotta was involved in the then-unsolved murder and decapitation of Hervey Medellin,{{r|abc6812|Obs_LAPD|Gazette_LAPD}} known as the "Hollywood Sign Murder", but later announced that they did not believe he was involved in the crime.{{r|LA cops}} The animal rights group [[Last Chance for Animals]] claimed responsibility for posting YouTube videos linking him to the Hollywood Sign Murder in an attempt to lure Magnotta into contacting them.{{r|LCA_edge|Obs_LCA|Fox_LCA}} LCA offered a $7500 reward for information leading to his arrest while he was on the run.{{r|LCA_reward}} On November 16, 2015, Gabriel Campos-Martinez was sentenced to 25 years to life for the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-life-in-hollywood-body-parts-case-20151116-story.html |title=Man gets 25 years to life in Hollywood sign body parts murder |website=Los Angeles Times |last1=Winton |first1=Richard |date=16 November 2015 |accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case also drew comparisons across North America to [[Mark Twitchell]], a convicted murderer inspired by ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', who used social media in his crimes and to self-promote his work.&lt;ref name=twitchell /&gt; Author [[Steve Lillebuen]], who wrote a book on the case, described a new trend in crime where social media allows killers to become "online broadcasters" and have direct, instant access to a global audience they may crave.&lt;ref name=steve /&gt;&lt;ref name=steve2 /&gt;

'''Marilyn Mosby''' (née '''James'''; born January 22, 1980) is an American politician and lawyer who currently serves as the [[State's Attorney]] for [[Baltimore]], Maryland, United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=African-American Power Couple at Baltimore's Vanguard|last=Adams|first=Blair|date=September 25, 2013|work=Afro|url=http://www.afro.com/african-american-power-couple-at-baltimores-vanguard|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NBCMosbyBio&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet Marilyn Mosby, the Woman Overseeing the Freddie Gray Investigation|publisher=NBC News|first=Elizabeth|last=Chuck|date=April 30, 2015|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/baltimore-unrest/meet-marilyn-mosby-woman-overseeing-freddie-gray-investigation-n351046}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is currently the youngest chief prosecutor of any major American city.

==Early life==
Born Marilyn James in Massachusetts, she was raised in [[Dorchester, Boston]] by her grandparents. Her mother, Linda Thompson, was 17 when Mosby was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/05/01/baltimore-prosecutor-has-deep-ties-boston/ytXP5IjJseH1t0FQw1YfJM/story.html|title=Freddie Gray case prosecutor Marilyn Mosby has deep ties to Boston|work=[[Boston Globe]]|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Adams|2013|p=A10}} Her mother and father both served as police officers; her family traces its association with the police for two generations, as her grandfather was one of the first African-American police officers in the state.&lt;ref name=NBCMosbyBio/&gt; She attended [[Dover-Sherborn High School]], an hour away from her home, as a result of METCO, the longest-standing school desegregation program in the country. She served in the Student Government Association, and was co-editor of the school newspaper.{{sfn|Adams|2013|p=A10}}

Her interest in practicing law was sparked by the murder of her 17-year-old cousin by another 17-year-old outside of her home. Her cousin was mistakenly identified as a drug dealer by his killer, and murdered.&lt;ref name=NBCMosbyBio/&gt;

In 2000, when she was a 20-year-old [[Tuskegee University]] student, James appeared on the ''[[Judge Judy]]'' television show as a plaintiff, suing a roommate for damaging her property during summer break. She prevailed in the arbitration, and was awarded $1,700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2015/05/28/video-marilyn-mosby-baltimore-prosecutor-freddie-gray-case-judge-judy|title=VIDEO: Marilyn Mosby, Baltimore Prosecutor in Freddie Gray Case, on Judge Judy|author=Fox News Insider|work=Fox News Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated [[magna cum laude]] from [[Tuskegee University]] with a ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]]) degree; she earned a [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Boston College Law School]] in 2005.

==Career==

Mosby was sworn into office on January 8, 2015.&lt;ref name= sworn&gt;{{cite news|title=Marilyn Mosby sworn in as Baltimore City state's attorney: Mosby, 34, becomes youngest top prosecutor in U.S.|date=January 9, 2015|publisher=[[WBAL-TV]]|location=Baltimore, Maryland|url=http://www.wbaltv.com/politics/marilyn-mosby-sworn-in-as-baltimore-city-states-attorney/30611736}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after her first term in office had begun, Mosby announced restructuring of her office that was inspired by ideas from prosecutors' offices in New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta.&lt;ref name= strategies&gt;{{cite news|title=Mosby announces new leadership, strategies|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=January 14, 2015|first1=Jessica|last1=Anderson|first2=Justin|last2=Fenton|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-mosby-staff-changes-20150114-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy State's Attorney Janice Bledsoe was named to oversee the new division of "criminal intelligence."&lt;ref name= strategies/&gt; Mosby reestablished community liaison positions, which her predecessor had eliminated, to inform residents of developments in cases relevant to their neighborhood. She created the Policy and Legislative Affairs Unit to advocate for legislation to help keep residents safe and prosecute cases efficiently.&lt;ref name=strategies/&gt;

Mosby pushed unsuccessfully for bills that would have allowed prosecutors to introduce prior accusations against serial [[sex offender]]s during trial, an issue which she raised during her campaign.&lt;ref name=BS.sex-offender/&gt; In May 2015, she secured the conviction of Nelson Clifford, a sex-offender who was acquitted in four previous sexual assault cases involving a "[[Consent (criminal law)|consent]]" defense.&lt;ref name=BS.sex-offender/&gt; After the verdict she stated, "While we were able to secure a guilty verdict in this case, we must still encourage our legislators in Annapolis to bring our predatory sexual assault laws in line with the federal statute.

===Violent criminal prosecutions===
Mosby campaigned on a promise to target and prosecute violent repeat offenders. Since her administration began in January 2015, she has successfully prosecuted a number of high-profile defendants, including Darryl Anderson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-darryl-anderson-fallin-sentencing-20150324-story.html|title=Killer gets life plus 240 years, flips off top prosecutor|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capone Chase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbaltv.com/news/Former-public-enemy-No-1-sentenced-to-life-in-fatal-shooting/31614062|title=Former public enemy No. 1 sentenced to life in fatal shooting|publisher=Wbaltv.com|date=March 4, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson Clifford,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-nelson-clifford-20150508-story.html|title=Prosecutors convict sex offenders in fifth trial|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 30, 2007|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mustafa Eraibi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-eraibi-sentenced-20150613-story.html|title=Man sentenced in Canton attack, robbery|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=June 16, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cornell Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2015/06/15/man-found-guilty-of-murdering-toddler|title=Man Found Guilty Of Murdering Toddler|website=Baltimore.cbslocal.com|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She created the Criminal Strategies Unit, modeled after a similar unit in the [[Manhattan]] District Attorney's Office, to harness the power of the community to identify and target violent repeat offenders.  The Unit utilizes technology, data-analysis, and intelligence-gathering in combination with close relationships with community organizations to identify trends in crime and works with law enforcement to target those who perpetuate these trends.&lt;ref name= strategies/&gt;

In response to a 2015 spike in violent crime in Baltimore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-crime-beat/bal-homicides-and-shootings-hit-record-highs-while-arrests-decline-in-baltimore-city-20150528-htmlstory.html|title=Homicides and shootings spike while arrests decline in Baltimore City|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=May 31, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosby and newly appointed interim Police Commissioner Kevin Davis announced that prosecutors and police officers would co-locate inside of a 24-hour "war room" in which law enforcement would target violent repeat offenders around the clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-violence-strategy-20150712-story.html#page=1|title=Baltimore police, partners create around-the-clock 'war room' to address crime surge|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=July 12, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freddie Gray case===
{{main|Death of Freddie Gray}}
In 2015, Mosby charged six police officers, who had arrested Freddie Gray prior to his death, with a variety of crimes including [[second-degree murder]] and [[involuntary manslaughter]].&lt;ref name="Calvert-Palazzolo-2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Calvert|first1=Scott|last2=Palazzolo|first2=Joe|date=April 30, 2015|title=After Baltimore Riots, Focus Turns to New Prosecutor: City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby must decide whether to charge police in man's death |work=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-baltimore-riots-focus-turns-to-new-prosecutor-1430356697|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh-2015"&gt;{{cite web|last=Walsh|first=Michael|date=May 1, 2015|title=Freddie Gray's death ruled a homicide; six Baltimore officers charged|work=Yahoo News|url=https://news.yahoo.com/freddie-gray-sustained-fatal-head-injury-in-back-of-police-van--report-124521845.html|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Jaros, an associate professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law, was reported as saying that Mosby quite possibly overcharged the officers, while noting this is absolutely typical in criminal cases involving defendants who are not police.&lt;ref name="Atlantic-2015"&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham|first=David|date=May 6, 2015|title=Can the Baltimore Prosecutor Win Her Case?|work=The Atlantic|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/05/can-the-baltimore-prosecutor-win-her-case/392489|accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anonymous sources were reported by [[CNN]] as saying the Baltimore police's investigation does not support some of the charges brought against the officers. However, these sources are within the police department, and according to CNN, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mosby has good reason to separate her probe from the police. There is widespread community distrust of the police. And many critics say letting police departments investigate themselves is partly why alleged excessive use of force incidents by officers rarely draw serious punishment.&lt;ref name="CNN-2015"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Mosby defended the charges in a statement released through a spokesperson, and condemned the release of information as unethical.&lt;ref name="CNN-2015"&gt;{{cite news|last=Perez|first=Evan|date=May 7, 2015|title=Sources: Baltimore police investigation doesn't support some of prosecution's charges|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/06/politics/freddie-gray-baltimore-knife-marilyn-mosby-prosecution|accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 4, 2015, interview on ''[[Fox News]]'', Harvard Law Professor [[Alan Dershowitz]] said that he believes Mosby overcharged the officers in an attempt to satisfy protesters and prevent further disturbances.&lt;ref name="Fox News Channel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/4214828955001/justice-or-crowd-control-dershowitz-on-baltimore-charges/?#sp=show-clips|title=Justice or crowd control? Dershowitz on Baltimore charges|publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=May 6, 2015|date=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Baltimore Prosecutor [[Page Croyder]] wrote an op-ed in ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' in which she described Mosby's charges as reflecting "either incompetence or an unethical recklessness". Croyder said that Mosby circumvented normal procedures "to step into the national limelight", and that she "pandered to the public", creating an expectation of a conviction.&lt;ref name="Croyder"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-freddie-gray-mosby-20150505-story.html|title=Police charges in Freddie Gray case are incompetent at best|last=Croyder|first=Page|date=May 5, 2015|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, a [[grand jury]] indicted the officers on most of the original charges filed by Mosby, with the exception of the charges of illegal imprisonment and [[false arrest]], and added charges of [[reckless endangerment]] to all the officers involved.&lt;ref name=nytgj&gt;{{Cite news|title=Six Baltimore Officers Indicted in Death of Freddie Gray|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/22/us/six-baltimore-officers-indicted-in-death-of-freddie-gray.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 21, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2015|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Mosby appeared onstage at concert with the musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], after which she was criticized for using the Freddie Gray incident for personal and political gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/11/us/baltimore-freddie-gray-mosby-criticism/index.html|title=Marilyn Mosby under fire after appearance at Prince gig|first=Eliott C.|last=McLaughlin|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Baltimore Sun'' reported that Mosby received $12,000 in free travel to speak at events around the nation after the officers were charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/investigations/bs-md-ci-mosby-expenses-20160603-story.html|title=Mosby's newfound popularity made her a sought-after national speaker in 2015|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked to respond to the allegation from police that she does not support the police, Mosby called the notion 'absurd', citing her family's history of working in law enforcement.&lt;ref name="FOX-2015"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Griff|date=June 10, 2015|title=Marilyn Mosby: 'Absurd' to think I don't have police officers' backs|work=FOX|url=http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/06/10/marilyn-mosby-absurd-to-think-dont-have-police-officers-backs|accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosby was criticized for ordering the increased police presence, in the same neighborhood where Gray was arrested, just weeks prior to the incident.&lt;ref name="Reuters-2015"&gt;{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=Ian|date=June 10, 2015|title=Baltimore prosecutors had asked police to target Freddie Gray corner: report|agency=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/10/us-usa-police-baltimore-idUSKBN0OQ1WT20150610|accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Porter was the first officer tried; this resulted in a [[hung jury]], and the judge declared a [[mistrial]] in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/freddie-gray-case-jury-enters-day-3-of-deliberations-in-trial-of-william-porter/2015/12/16/19474e3e-a374-11e5-b53d-972e2751f433_story.html|title=Judge declares mistrial in case of officer charged in Freddie Gray death|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Baltimore Sun'' reported that Porter was within one vote of an [[acquittal]] on the most serious charge against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/freddie-gray/bs-md-ci-porter-jury-split-20160115-story.html|title=Jury in Officer Porter trial was one vote from acquittal on most serious charge|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community outreach===

Mosby started initiatives to engage the Baltimore community, including:
* Aim to B'MORE – Begun in the spring of 2015 to provide an alternative to incarceration and a criminal record for first-time, non-violent felony drug offenders. Eligible defendants are granted probation before judgment, and placed on three years of probation. During probation, defendants complete 150 hours of community service, job skills training, and GED testing and/or substance abuse treatment as needed.  The Office of the State's Attorney partnered with local employers to secure full-time jobs for program participants following completion of their job skills training. If successful, after three years participants can apply to expunge their records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alejandro|first=Roberto|url=http://www.afro.com/with-aim-to-bmore-program-mosby-looks-to-address-structural-issues-driving-crime|title=With Aim to B'More Program, Mosby Looks to Address Structural Issues Driving Crime|publisher=Afro|date=June 24, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Junior State's Attorney – Launched in the summer of 2015, the program introduces up to 30 promising middle school students each summer to careers in the criminal justice field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-mosby-junior-prosecutor-program-20150326-story.html|title=Mosby launches 'junior' prosecutor program for kids|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=March 26, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Community Day in Court – In an effort to rebuild trust and faith in the criminal justice system, Mosby began holding quarterly Community Days in Court, bringing the public and law enforcement quarterly together to discuss issues plaguing the City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbal.com/article/114417/21/mosby-discusses-community-day-in-court-event-distrust-of-law-enforcement|title=Mosby Discusses 'Community Day In Court' Eve|publisher=Wbal.com|date=April 6, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13288">[[File:Nova Muixeranga d'Algemesí.jpg|250px|thumb|Muixeranga of Algemesi]]
The '''''Muixeranga''''' ({{IPA-ca|mujʃeˈɾaŋɡa|va|Muixeranga.ogg}}) is the collective name given to the performance of ancient [[street dance]]s and [[human pyramid]]s or ''[[castell]]s'', originating in the ancient [[Kingdom of Valencia]] (currently the [[Valencian Community]] or Valencian Land), which are still preserved in the town of [[Algemesí]], {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} southwest from [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], and certain other Valencian towns.

The ''muixeranga'' is much more than an artistic [[acrobatics|acrobatic]] dance. It is a collection of ancient human [[choreography|choreographies]] of enormous [[Plastic arts|plasticity]] illustrating various figures and shapes, which are held during the [[Festivity of ‘la Mare de Déu de la Salut’ of Algemesí|Algemesí town festival]] (September 7 and 8th), in honor of the Virgin of Health (''Mare de Déu de la Salut'').

The ''Muixeranga'' resembles the modern ''[[casteller]]s'' in many ways, the latter being spread all over [[Catalonia]]. Both traditions share the same origin, the "Moixiganga", (a series of dances of human towers) once found throughout the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Muixeranga differs from [[casteller]]s mainly in that the ''Muixeranga'' has a religious background and is accompanied by a traditional dance, it is also focused in the  height of the [[Human tower (gymnastic formation)|human towers]], but focuses also in the complexity and technique in order to create a [[Plastic arts|plastic]], figurative scene.

==[[La Mare de Déu de la Salut Festival]]==
The feast day of Our Lady of Health, patroness of Algemesi is September 8, and commemorates the legendary discovery in 1247 of a statue depicting the Madonna and Child. The image venerated in the town since the mid-twentieth century is a replica, because during the Civil War the original image of the Virgin of Health was destroyed, as was the chapel. The festival appears to have originated in a street party in the area of the Chapel of Finding and gradually spread to other neighborhoods. The main celebration in held on 7 and 8 September, is preceded by a novena at the Chapel of the Finding, which begins August 29 and ends on September 6. The festival has preserved traditional dances and music, and has served as a source for the recovery of dances that formally existed in other locations and have been able to be re-established.

[[File:Processó de la Mare de Déu de la Salut d'Algemesí.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Festivity of 'la Mare de Déu de la Salut' of Algemesí.]]

The involvement of the town’s inhabitants is the foundation upon which the continuity of this celebration is based. Each ritual works and has been prepared independently since the 18th Century. From the “Muixeranga” through to each of the dances, the different variations and musical scores have been passed from generation to generation. In the early 18th Century the dances belonged to different guilds; for example, the “Muixeranga” was the domain of construction workers, the “Carxofa” of the weavers, and so on. But social changes brought modifications to this custom and the traditions opened up to include people from other professional sectors. 
UNESCO has recognized the ritual, festive and community participation dimension of the Valencian celebration Our Lady of Health as part of the "intangible heritage of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/sociedad/muixeranga-algemesi-patrimonio-humanidad-1242581&amp;usg=ALkJrhjlfn5lFrz9e4D1oJNjFyAhlHxbIQ "Unesco declares Algemesí Muixeranga intangible heritage of humanity", ''el Periódico'', 28 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Festivity of “la Mare de Déu de la Salut” has been studied by ethno-anthropologists, sociologists and historians. It has inspired artists, musicians and poets. All of these people have remarked on the breadth of the cultural content of this event. Artistic groups such as the “Muixeranga”; dances like “els Bastonets” or “els Tornejants”; or the music that accompanies the performances are all the result of having conserved a fundamental part of the cultural heritage of an entire town.
It was this popularity and interest in the tradition that led to the creation in 2002, of the Museu Valencià de la Festa (a Museum dedicated to the Festivity); which offers exhibitions and research into the Festivity. At the centre, visitors can learn about the history, the ritual acts, the dances, the music and the costumes of the celebration, as well as enjoying many stories from the event.

== Origin and evolution ==
There are several theories on the origin of muixeranga, especially in relation to its name. The first theory advocates that the word comes from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''mochain'', meaning "[[mask]]". A second theory links it with ancient processions held on the streets to commemorate some special event.

Even though the tradition in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] may date back to the 13th century, the first written record of the ''muixeranga'' in [[Algemesí]] can be traced to the first third of the 18th century. However, its constant, strong presence suggests a much older origin.

The first solemn celebrations of the Virgin of Health happened in 1724, so this is the earliest that the muixeranga could be linked to this celebration. However, the first concrete date comes from the town account book in the year 1733, when the [[dulzaina]] players employed in the festival were given an annual stipend.

The guilds were the real driving force behind the event, and in changing times, they died out. The Muixeranga began to wane and by 1973 it had almost disappeared altogether. A group including writer Martí Domínguez i Barberà, Mayor Manuel Rico, Vicent Raga, festival organiser in the Capella neighbourhood, and Father Vicent Castell Maiques, with the support of the students’ association Associació d'Antics Alumnes dels Maristes, were responsible for re-launching it under the guidance of Tomàs Pla. A year later the Friends of assossiació Muixeranga was founded.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ca&amp;u=http://www.museuvalenciadelafesta.com/default.asp%3FDocID%3D317%26Tpl%3Ddescripciofesta.asp&amp;prev=search "Muixeranga", Museo Valencia de la Festa]&lt;/ref&gt; Eloi Miralles, a member of the Colla de Castellers de Vilafranca del Penedès, arranged for the muixeranguers to visit the Penedès capital and on August 31, 1978, the Muixeranga rose up in Villafranca’s main square, banishing forever that lack of visibility which might have proved fatal.&lt;ref name=metode/&gt;

==Processions==

===The Promeses Processó===
At nightfall on 7 September, the beginning of the festivities is signaled by the ringing of the bells of the Basilica of St. James the Apostle. When the ringing stops and silence descends, the first notes of the flutes are sounded and the first of the processions begins. The procession, which begins with the mysteries and martyrdoms, (short theatrical pieces, performed by groups of children), has a scrupulous order with the towers of the Muixeranga second, followed by the Bastonets, the Carxofa, the Arquets, the Pastoretes, Bolero or llauradores.

===Processoneta of Mati===
On the morning of September 8, there is a second, shorter procession known as the ''Processoneta of Mati''.

===The Volta Great===
The procession called the Volta Great, starts about 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and is the longest, lasting over seven hours. Starting from the Basilica of St. James, the traditional dances of Algemesí and the image of the patron pass back through the old city, repeating the original itinerary of 1724.

== Characteristics ==
After the mysteries and martyrdoms, all the processions display a series of dances; the Muixerangas leads the rest. The Muixerangas , a set of tableaux composed of human towers and representative figures, has several stages, and opens with all muixerangueros dancing in two rows with candles burning. The dance is accompanied by the music of drum and flute. The muixerangueros then form a human tower moving to the sound of the music. The tower is topped by a child with open arms.

The forms of the Muixerangas assume plastic or pliable shapes that open or appear to form different figures which have all Marian symbolism. The Valencian town of Algemesi and its Muixeranga, lays claim to being the origin of the ''[[castell]]s'' found throughout Catalonia.

[[File:Mare_de_Déu_de_la_Salut_35.jpg|thumb|right|200px|muixerangers preparing the elevation of muixeranga tower.]]
 
The people composing the castles are usually a group of men, of virtually any profession, but preferably of strength and physical skill. Nowadays, around 200 men participate in the plastic figures, but historically there were not more than thirty. There is a master, or conductor, which coordinates the dance and the human castles, towers and other figures, as well as admitting and training new people.

The clothes are idiosyncratic in many ways. They are composed of a shirt, trousers, farmer's shoes and sometimes a special hat. The fabric is coloured with vertical red and blue stripes on a white base, like a [[harlequin]]. It seems that this strange appearance is unintentional. Older people can still remember that they were once made from old mattress fabric.

Accompanying the group, some young members carry some jugs cut in half and painted with stripes with typical colors of the same muixeranga (designed by former member Juan Ezquer in 1973) which serves to collect funds for the activities of Muixeranga.

== Music and symbology ==
{{listen|filename=Xavi_Richart_-_Muixeranga_(low_quality).ogg|title=The Muixeranga song|description=Performed by Xavier Richart}}

The dance is accompanied by the music of [[tabalet]] (a [[drum]]) and [[dulzaina|dolçaina]] (valencian [[shawm]]), with a very old characteristic [[Musical tuning|tune]], of unknown author.

Some people striving for the recovery of the Valencian culture and its language, such as [[Joan Fuster]], have suggested the music of the Muixeranga as an [[anthem]] for the [[Valencian Community]].&lt;ref name=metode&gt;[http://metode.cat/en/Annual-Review/Monographs/The-Festive-Gene/The-Muixeranga-a-Long-Journey Viadel, Francese.

{{Violence against women}}

During the [[Syrian civil war]], there have been severe [[Human rights violations during the Syrian Civil War|human rights violations]], including rape which has been used as a 
[[Wartime sexual violence|strategy]] throughout the conflict,{{sfn|Litsas|Tziampiris|2015|p=202}} by pro government supporters, members of the [[Free Syrian Army]]{{sfn|Priddy|2014|p=320}} and militants fighting for the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]. According to the  non governmental organization (NGO), the [[International Rescue Committee]] (IRC) rape has been a "significant and disturbing feature" during the conflict.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2016|p=33}} The IRC have reported that the primary reason given for 600,000 women fleeing the war zone is fear of sexual assault. The NGO [[Human Rights Watch]] have requested that the United Nations Security Council refer Syria to the [[International Criminal Court]].{{sfn|Proudman|2013}}

==Syrian state forces==

Following the onset of the [[Arab spring]], which had spread to Syria in 2011, reports of rape by pro government forces increased.{{sfn|Flock|2011}} In [[Daraa]], at the onset of the conflict state forces organized the rape of women in the region.{{sfn|Bentley|2016|p=109}}{{sfn|Omar|2015}}

In Syria women who are raped can become victims of [[honour killings]], or if allowed by their families to live are no longer eligible for marriage. When the state forces began their crackdown on protesters in [[Jisr al-Shugour]] a tactic used was raiding homes in which women were sleeping.{{sfn|Tuysuz|2011}} A report released by [[Save the Children]] in 2013 stated, “There is proof that girls and boys scarcely over the age of 12 have experienced sexual violence, including both torture to their genitals and rape.”{{sfn|Minano|Andrzejewski|2017}} Sarah Leah, the director for the Middle East branch of HRW has said that, “Syrian security forces have used sexual violence… with complete impunity,”{{sfn|Proudman|2013}}

==Islamic State==

During the [[Genocide of Yazidis by ISIL|Yazidis genocide]], IS sold women into sexual slavery and raped girls as young as nine.{{sfn|Wintour|2016}} Amar Hussein, a captured IS terrorist who has admitted to raping over 200 women, stated that those in command had given free rein to IS fighters to rape as many Yazidi women as they wanted.{{sfn|Georgy|2017}} A report by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] states that "women and girls as young as nine are being sold as slaves to ISIS soldiers who regularly beat them and rape them, re-sell them, and, if they try to escape, kill them."{{sfn|Chapman2016}}

A pamphlet published online by IS on the social media platform [[Twitter]] explicitly endorsed the rape of children, it reads, "It is permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who hasn't reached puberty, if she is fit for intercourse".{{sfn|Callimachi|2013}}

==International reactions==

In 2012 in a declaration by the UN stated that in Syria rape was being used as a weapon of war, however the help being given to victims was "sorely lacking", and that "Hospitals and clinics are not equipped to deal with the sheer volume of victims, and many victims do not report their attacks"{{sfn|Harvey|2015}}

The NGO [[Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network]] (EMHRN) released a report in November 2013 stated that, since the conflict began in 2011, approximately 6,000 women had been raped, which included gang-rapes, with figures likely to be far higher given that the majority cases go unreported.{{sfn|BBC|2013}} According to the EMHRN report the majority of documented attacks have occurred during government-backed attacks on rebel positions, on those kept in detention and at checkpoints.{{sfn|Jackson|2013}}

Speaking at the UN in 2012, Norwegian Foreign Minister [[Espen Barth Eide]] stated that the [[Rape during the Bosnian War|rapes]] which occurred during the [[Bosnian war]] were being repeated in Syria, with rapes in the tens of thousands. {{sfn|Brinkley|2013}}

During the first 11 months of 2013 the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) released figures which showed that it had given psychological help to 33,430 people in Syria who had been victims of either rape or gender based violence, with a further 4,800 cases reported in December 2013.{{sfn|Miles|2013}} Jody Williams of the [[International Campaign to Stop Rape &amp; Gender Violence in Conflict]] has said of the sexual violence being visited on the men, women and children of Syria, "With every war and major conflict, as an international community we say 'never again' to mass rape, Yet, in Syria, as countless women are again finding the war waged on their bodies--we are again standing by and wringing our hands."{{sfn|Wolfe|2013}}

There are Masonic degrees named after the Knights Templar but not all Knights Templar Orders are Masonic.

There is no direct connection with the 13th-century presence of [[Knights Templar in Scotland]]. However, since the 1980s such a connection has been a popular topic in fiction and in pseudohistorical speculation.

==Early modern history==
In the seventeenth century, interest in Templarism became political after the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], with the idea that Stuart partisans invented a Templar degree, as the king's death was to be avenged, as was the violent death in 1314 of [[Jacques de Molay]], last Grand Master of the Templars. The story told by [[Antoine Augustin Calmet|Dom Calmet]] was that [[John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee|Viscount Dundee]] was supposed to have been an early Templar Grand Master and to have fallen at [[Battle of Killiecrankie|Killiecrankie]] wearing the Grand Cross of the Order. The [[John Erskine, 22nd Earl of Mar|Duke of Mar]] is then said to have held office, after which time the Templar Order was apparently inactive until its revival by [[Charles Edward Stuart]] in 1745.  An original letter of the [[James Drummond, 3rd Duke of Perth|3rd Duke of Perth]] to [[Earl of Airlie]] Lord Ogilvy shortly after the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] victory at [[Battle of Prestonpans|Prestonpans]], described a secret ceremony at [[Holyrood Palace|Holyrood]] in which the prince was elected Grand Master of the ancient chivalry of the Temple of Jerusalem on Tuesday 24 September 1745.&lt;ref name="Edward Corp page 104"&gt;The Stuart Court in Rome: A Legacy of Exile (Visual Arts Research Institute Edinburgh S.) Edward Corp (Editor) {{ISBN|0-7546-3324-1}} "Seventeenth-century Templarism acquired political overtones after the beheading of Charles I, and it has been suggested the 'since the king's death was to be avenged, certain Stuart partisans fabricated a Templar degree in which the violent death in 1314 of Jacques de Molay, last Grand Master of the Templars, called for vengeance,' Dundee himself is supposed to have been an early Templar Grand Master and to have fallen at Killiecrankie wearing the Grand Cross of the Order. The Duke of Mar also held office, after which time the Templar Order apparently fell into abeyance until its revival by Charles Edward in 1745.
An extract from the 3rd Duke of Perth's original letter to Lord Ogilvy shortly after the Jacobite victory at Prestonpans, describes , in vivid detail, a secret ceremony at Holyrood in which the prince was elected Grand Master of the ancient chivalry of the Temple of Jerusalem on Tuesday 24 September 1745..."page 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restoring the Temple of Vision: Cabalistic Freemasonry and Stuart Culture By Marsha Keith Schuchard, p 767 "According to the early eighteenth-century writers, Jacob de Lennep, Abbe de Buisson, and Dom Calvet, Dundee was wearing a Templar Cross, emblematic of his role as Grand Master of the Scottish Order of the Temple."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry 1921 by Arthur Edward Waite {{ISBN|0-7661-2973-X}} "Viscount Dundee.- It remains to be said that there is one captivating story which, if we can take it as given, will carry back evidence of an ORDER OF THE TEMPLE to the year 1689 and to Scotland. It has been said that the well-known French Historian and theologian Dom Calmet has lent the authority of his name to three important statements: (1) That John Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee, was Grand Master of the ORDER OF TEMPLARS in Scotland; (2) that when he fell at Killiecrankie on July 27, 1689 he wore the Grand Cross of the Order; {3) that this Cross was given to Calmet by his brother.  If this story be true we are brought at one into the presence of a Templar survival or restoration which owes nothing to the dream of realities of the Chevalier Ramsay, nothing to the passion for the High Grades of Masonry, and nothing - so far as can be told - to Masonry itself, whether Operative or Speculative. We know that evidence is wanting at every point for the alleged perpetuation of the old Templar Order in connection with Masonry and that the legends of such perpetuation bear all the traces of manufacture. They are of course long posterior to the tragedy of Killiecrankie, and it has been a common practice of masonic writers in the past to say that the hypothesis of survival was invented by Ramsay, who also manufactured Templar Grades.  Both statement are untrue as I have shewn elsewhere. It is very curious that such a legend should have arisen in connection with Masonry, and if it originated circa 1740 or later, there is no question that it was prompted by Ramsay's Oration, though the KNIGHTS TEMPLAR were not named therein. But if a Grand Cross of the Temple was actually and provably found on the body of Viscount Dundee, it is certain that the ORDER OF THE TEMPLE had survived or revived in 1689." p 223 "Among legendary or mythical Grand Masters are - in Scotland Viscount Dundee, the Earls of Mar and Atholl, Prince Charles Edward Stuart, John Olivant of Bachilton and Alexander Deuchar."
p 227 "The Grade of Templar Priesthood ...claimed the year 1686 as that of its revival, thus antedating the Calmet story concerning Viscount Dundee." p 452&lt;/ref&gt;

Templarism experienced a revival of interest in the eighteenth century through Freemasonry with a Scottish influence.  The first record of this is in Ramsay's Oration in Paris in 1737. [[Andrew Michael Ramsay]] was tutor to the Young Pretender, Prince [[Charles Edward Stuart]]. He claimed that Freemasonry had begun among crusader knights and that they had formed themselves into Lodges of St John. The next development was with [[Karl Gotthelf von Hund|Karl Gotthelf, Baron Von Hund, and Alten-Grotkau]], who had apparently been introduced to the concept by the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] Lord Kilmarnock, and received into a Templar Chapter by a mysterious "Knight of the Red Feather".&lt;ref&gt;Network North: Scottish Kin, Commercial and Covert Associations in Northern Europe 1603&amp;ndash;1746 By Steve Murdoch p.337&lt;/ref&gt; Baron von Hund established a new Masonic rite called the "Strict Templar Observance". The "Knight of the Red Feather" has been identified subsequently as Alexander Seton better known as [[Alexander Montgomerie, 10th Earl of Eglinton]], a prominent Freemason in the Jacobite movement.&lt;ref name="Edward Corp page 104"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arcane Schools page 434"/&gt;

Since the mid nineteenth century myths, legends and anecdotes connecting the Templars to the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] have been created. Degrees in Freemasonry, such as the [[Royal Order of Scotland]], allude to the story of Rosslyn and the '''Scottish Knights Templar'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.templarhistory.com/scotland.html The Legend of Bruce and the Legend of D'Aumont&lt;/ref&gt; This theme was repeated in the [[pseudohistory]] book ''The Temple and The Lodge'' by [[Michael Baigent]] and [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]], first published in 1989. On the subject of a possible Bruce connection, Masonic Historian D Murray Lyon wrote ''"The fraternity of Kilwinning never at any period practiced or acknowledged other than the Craft degrees; neither does there exist any tradition worthy of the name, local or national, nor has any authentic document yet been discovered that can in the remotest degree be held to identify Robert Bruce with the holding of Masonic Courts, or the institution of a secret society at Kilwinning."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Encyclopedia of Freemasonry Part 1 and Its Kindred Sciences Comprising the Whole Range of Arts byy Albert Gallatin Mackey p 447&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masonic order==
{{Main article|Knights Templar (Freemasonry)|Freemasonry in Scotland}}
The modern revival of Templarism in Scotland starts with [[Alexander Deuchar]].  The records of one of Scottish Freemasonry's most prestigious lodges, the St Mary's Chapel Lodge of Edinburgh, describe the visit of a ''"...deputation from the Grand Assembly of the High Knights Templar in Edinburgh… headed by their most worshipful Grand Master, Alexander Deuchar...the first time for some hundred years that any Lodge of Freemasonry had been visited by an assembly of Knights Templar, headed by their Grand Master."'' This implies that there was an Order in existence 100 years earlier. In 1811 with a Charter from the Templar Grand Master in England, the Duke of Kent, Alexander Deuchar established the Grand Conclave of Knights of the Holy Temple and Sepulchre, and of St. John of Jerusalem. Controversially in 1836 ''"...it was proposed that non-Masons be admitted to the Order, at the same time the ritual was adapted in order to allow this to happen.,,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compulink.co.uk/~craftings/200years.htm A brief history of the Knights of the Temple and of the Preceptory and Priory of St. George Aboyne 1794&amp;ndash;1994 An original Paper by E. J. Boyd]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry 1921 by Arthur Edward Waite Pages 231-232 {{ISBN|0-7661-2973-X}} "In 1811&amp;ndash;1812, Alexander Deuchar, Eminent Commander of Edinburgh Encampment, No 31, under the Early Grand Constitution, established what is termed a schismatic body with the style and title of the Supreme Grand Conclave of Scotland. He is said to have assumed the Office of Grand Master for life, notwithstanding the displeasure of his associates. The Conclave appears to have been moribund in 1830. In 1836 it was remodelled, vacating its Masonic position and admitting non-Masons to membership, including the Bishop of Aberdeen and the Duke of Leeds."&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Masonic Cyclopedia 1877 by Kenneth R H MacKenzie Page 156 {{ISBN|0-7661-2611-0}}
:"DEUCHAR CHARTERS.-So called from Alexander Deuchar, an engraver, who was the principal mover in the establishment of the Grand Conclave of Knight Templar in Scotland, and its first Grand Master in the early part of this century. Deuchar seems to have become acquainted with Knights Templarism, in consequence of communications he had with Fratres serving in the Shropshire Militia, who had been dubbed under a warrant emanating from Dublin. This corps was quartered in Edinburgh in 1798 ; and from the Fratres of this corps it is most probable that the first Grand Assembly of Knights Templar was opened in Edinburgh ; this, however gave place to the Grand Assembly of High Knights Templar, working Under a charter No 31 from the Early Grand Encampment of Ireland, of which Deuchar was Grand Master.  But these Deuchar Charters were clearly extra-Masonic, as they authorised Encampments to install Knights Templar and Knights of St John of Jerusalem, on the one condition that that such Encampments should not hold any communion or intercourse with any Chapter or Encampment, or body assuming that name, holding meetings of Knights Templar, under a Master Mason's Charter This body, however, lost its authority, in consequence of having nothing over which to exercise it, about 1837."&lt;/ref&gt; Previously only Royal Arch Masons in Good Standing were allowed to join. Only the Royal Grand Conclave was allowed to admit non-Masons and these men were never members of any Encampments, only of Grand Conclave."'' The modern non Masonic Order [http://www.templarhistory.com/mts.html Militi Templi Scotia] claims descent from Alexander Deuchar who was a Freemason.

The Masonic Movement is generally referred to as the [[Knights Templar (Freemasonry)|Knights Templar]], but the full Style and Title of this body is "The United Religious, Military, and Masonic Orders of the Temple, and of St.John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes, and Malta".

==Non-Masonic groups==
There are today a number of smaller Groups of non-Masonic Knights Templar in Scotland, including [http://www.skt.org.uk/ The Autonomous Grand Priory of Scotland]; [http://www.scottishknightstemplar.org The Grand Priory of the Knights Templar in Scotland]; The OSMTH/SMOTJ International recognized Body in Scotland; [http://www.grandprioryofthescots.org/ The Grand Priory of the Scots]; [http://www.templarusa.org The Confederation of Scottish Knights Templar] or the International Federative Alliance; [http://www.siol-nan-gaidheal.org/templar.htm The Ancient Scottish Military Order of Knights Templar] and Militi Templi Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/s2.cfm?id=684312002 The Scotsman]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scottish Knights Templar cross on black field.svg|thumb|The [[cross pattée]] of The Scottish Knights Templar]]
Knights Templar Internationally use the [[Cross pattée]], including The Commandery of St Clair in alignment with the International Order OSMTH, The Grand Priory of the Scots (mainly American Scots) a Cross with two branches, and other Scottish Knights Templar Groups use the Eight Pointed Cross coloured red more commonly but not exclusively known as the [[Maltese Cross]], of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] or Order of St. John or Cross of Amalfi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.araldicacivica.it/vecchio%20sito/Campania/Comuni%20sa/amalfi.htm Amalfi]&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish Templar use of the Maltese Cross probably dates to the 1960s although the Cross itself is much older.

The Scottish Knights Templar of OSMTH International have their own tartan. It was ratified and approved by the Grand Conclave of Militi Scotia S.M.O.J in Perth 28 March 1998. The original name was "Scottish Knights Templar of Militi Templi Scotia International." but it was changed to "Scottish Knights Templar of OSMTH International" in 2006. OSMTH stands for; "Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani".

==Role in pseudohistory and popular culture==
{{further information|Knights Templar and popular culture}}
The legend that Knight Templars escaped their persecution in Europe and headed for sanctuary in Scotland has pervaded through hundreds of modern pseudohistory publications.  Connections between Templarism and Freemasonry have been around for as long but publishers saw a synergy from the 1980s onwards in trying to connect Templarism, Freemasonry, Rosslyn Chapel, Esoteric belief systems and Scotland altogether.  A number of key publications that try to tie Templarism, Freemasonry and Scotland together include:

&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' (1982), Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry Hardcover
John J. Robinson, ''Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry Hardcover'' (1989),
 Michael Baigent  ''The Temple and the Lodge'' (1991),
[[Philip Coppens (author)|Coppens, Philip]]. ''The Stone Puzzle of Rosslyn Chapel''. Frontier Publishing/Adventures Unlimited Press (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
It is discussed in the [[pseudohistory]] book ''The Temple and The Lodge'' by [[Michael Baigent]] and [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]], first published in 1989. On the subject of a possible Bruce connection, Masonic Historian D Murray Lyon wrote ''"The fraternity of Kilwinning never at any period practiced or acknowledged other than the Craft degrees; neither does there exist any tradition worthy of the name, local or national, nor has any authentic document yet been discovered that can in the remotest degree be held to identify Robert Bruce with the holding of Masonic Courts, or the institution of a secret society at Kilwinning."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==St Clair — Sinclair speculation==
According to tradition, William St Clair, ([[William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness|William Sinclair]]) 3rd Earl of Orkney, Baron of Roslin and 1st Earl of Caithness built [[Rosslyn Chapel]]. A later William Sinclair of Roslin became the first Grand Master of the [[Grand Lodge of Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Arcane Schools page 434"&gt;Arcane Schools, John Yarker, {{ISBN|1-56459-306-1}} page 434&lt;/ref&gt;  The St Clair, later Sinclair, Earls of Rosslyn or [[Roslin, Midlothian|Roslin]] have also been connected to Templarism in Scotland, but Mark Oxbrow and Ian Robertson in their recent book, 'Rosslyn and the Grail',&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Rosslyn and the Grail, Mark Oxbrow and Ian Robertson {{ISBN|1-84596-076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; note that the St Clair of Rosslyn testified against the Templars at their trial in Edinburgh in 1309. Dr. Louise Yeoman points out that the Rosslyn/Knights Templar connection is false, having been invented by 18th century fiction-writers, and that [[Rosslyn Chapel]] was built by William Sinclair so that Mass could be said for the souls of his family.&lt;ref name="Scotsman.com News"&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/edinburgh.cfm?id=658952006 Scotsman.com News]&lt;/ref&gt;   In Michael T.R.B Turnbull's book Rosslyn Chapel Revealed he states that "Eighteen years after the suppression of the Order, Sir William Sainteclaire, in the role of a Crusader(not Templar), made a brave and honourable bid to fulfil the wishes of his late monarch, King Robert The Bruce".&lt;ref name="Rosslyn Chapel Revealed page 152"&gt;Rosslyn Chapel Revealed, Michael T.R.B Turnbull, {{ISBN|978-0-7509-4467-0}} page 152&lt;/ref&gt; He then explains that he and his wife Lady Margaret Ramsay of Dalhousie produced a son (also Sir William)to succeed him as the 8th Baron of Rosslyn. Turnbull States that "His father could never have been a Knight Templar, as his wealth and marriage would have broken two of the three Templar vows — Poverty and chastity".&lt;ref name="Rosslyn Chapel Revealed page 152"/&gt;

In  18th century fiction, a connection was made between the Templars and 
[[Rosslyn Chapel]], built by ([[William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness]].&lt;ref name="Scotsman.com News"/&gt;   
According to Freemason [[John Yarker]], a later William Sinclair of Roslin became the first Grand Master of the [[Grand Lodge of Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Arcane Schools page 434"&gt;[[John Yarker]], Arcane Schools (1909) page 434&lt;/ref&gt;  The St Clair, later Sinclair, Earls of Rosslyn or [[Roslin, Midlothian|Roslin]] have also been connected to Templarism in Scotland.

==Before shooting==
He had been investigated by every [[Garda Síochána|Garda]] specialist unit since he was a teenager.&lt;ref name=it-david-byrne-profile&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/david-byrne-profile-victim-one-of-a-new-breed-of-criminal-1.2525565|title=David Byrne profile: Victim one of a new breed of criminal|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]|first=Conor|last=Lally|date=7 Feb 2016|accessdate=25 Mar 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was present at the fatal stabbing of Declan Gavin in August 2001 in [[Crumlin, Dublin]].&lt;ref name=it-david-byrne-profile/&gt; He was called as a witness in the trial of Brian Rattigan for the killing, but said he had seen nothing.&lt;ref name=it-david-byrne-profile/&gt;

David Byrne had been arrested many times and was a suspect in the murder of Gary Bryan in [[Walkinstown]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=ii-murder-victim-david-byrne/&gt;

In January 2016 Gardaí had a special policing plan put in place for the following month when two boxing events would be attented by members of a criminal gang associated with [[Christy Kinahan]].&lt;ref name=herald-armed-gardai-on-alert&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/armed-gardai-on-alert-as-kinahan-mob-fly-in-for-boxing-events-34408940.html|title=Armed gardai on alert as Kinahan mob fly in for boxing events|date=30 Jan 2016|accessdate=25 Mar 2016|publisher=[[The Herald (Ireland)|The Herald]]|first=Ken|last=Foy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kinahan gang have a long association with boxing both in Dublin and [[Marbella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/kinahan-mob-is-heavily-involved-in-professional-boxing-34428959.html|title=

==Shooting==
On 5 February 2016 there was to be a boxing match for the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] European Lightweight title between [[Jamie Kavanagh]] and Antonio João Bento at the Regency Hotel in [[Whitehall, Dublin]]. At the [[weigh-in]] there was an organised armed attack; the match was cancelled after the shooting.&lt;ref name=rte-major-investigation&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0205/765708-one-person-injured-in-shooting-incident-at-hotel/|title=Major investigation into fatal hotel shooting gets under way|publisher=[[RTÉ News and Current Affairs]]|date=6 Feb 2016|accessdate=2 Jul 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were at least four attackers with masks, army style-helmets and flak jackets, two of whom were disguised as members of the [[Garda Emergency Response Unit]] and armed with [[AK-47]]s.  An associate of the Kinahan cartel, David Byrne (32) was shot dead; security sources said that the gang had intended to kill others. Two men were injured and taken to the [[Mater Private Hospital]] and [[Beaumont Hospital, Dublin|Beaumont Hospital]].&lt;ref name=rte-major-investigation/&gt; It is believed that Daniel Kinahan, the son of [[Christy Kinahan]], was the intended target, but had left early. After the attack, security camera recordings suggested that six people had been involved, including a man disguised as a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/dublin-drugs-shooting-spain-gang-warfare |title=Murders in Spain, and a Dublin attack with AK-47s: the deadly 20-year war of Ireland's drug cartels |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 7 February 2016 |author=Henry McDonald|accessdate= 13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers  escaped in a [[Ford Transit]] van which was later found burnt-out.&lt;ref name=rte-major-investigation/&gt;

One line of investigation is that the shooting was in revenge for the murder of Gary Hutch in Spain in September 2015.&lt;ref name=rte-major-investigation/&gt;

==Funeral==
Because of the length of time Byrne's body would be [[Wake (ceremony)|waked]] at his parents' house before the funeral, special security measures were put in place.&lt;ref name=irish-examiner-5-day-garda-op&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/5-day-garda-op-for-david-byrne-funeral-381250.html|title=5-day Garda op for David Byrne funeral|publisher=[[Irish Examiner]]|first1=Cormac|last1=O'Keefe|first2=Fiachra|last2=Ó Cionnaith|first3=Juno|last3=McEnroe|date=11 Feb 2016|accessdate=25 Mar 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral was held at the [[Church of St Nicholas of Myra Without, Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Church of St Nicholas of Myra, Francis Street]].&lt;ref name=irish-examiner-5-day-garda-op/&gt; Gardaí checked the church before and after the ceremony for explosives but the funeral passed without incident and the hearse went to [[Mount Jerome Cemetery and Crematorium|Mount Jerome Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=irish-examiner-5-day-garda-op/&gt;

==Suspect==

Shortly after the shooting a call was placed to the BBC saying that the [[Continuity IRA]] had carried out the attack because Byrne had been involved in the [[Real Irish Republican Army#2012–present: Since the merger ("New IRA")|killing of Alan Ryan]] four years before. However, the Continuity IRA later stated that it was not responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/12148779/AK-47s-used-in-Dublin-shooting-could-have-been-former-IRA-weapons-peace-process-observer-says.html |title=AK-47s used in Dublin shooting 'could have been former IRA weapons' peace process observer says |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date= 9 February 2016 |author=Gordon Rayner|accessdate= 14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May 2016 Patrick Hutch, the brother of [[Shooting of Gary Hutch|Gary Hutch]], was charged at the [[Criminal Courts of Justice (Dublin)|Criminal Courts of Justice]] with the murder of David Byrne. There was no application for bail; the defendant was granted [[Legal aid#England and Wales|legal aid]] and remanded to appear in Clover Hill District Court on 25 May.&lt;ref name=rte-news-man-charged-with-regency-murder&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0518/789268-david-byrne-investigation/|title=Man charged with Regency Hotel murder|publisher=[[RTÉ News and Current Affairs]]|date=18 May 2016|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36325341|title=David Byrne murder: Man in court over Dublin boxing weigh-in attack|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=18 May 2016|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The trial of Patrick Hutch for murder and possession of firearms was later set for January 2018 at the non-jury [[Special Criminal Court]]; he was denied bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/patrick-hutch-denied-bail-over-12355647 |title=Patrick Hutch denied bail over David Byrne Regency Hotel murder |newspaper=Dublin Live |date=21 December 2016 |author=Natasha Reid |accessdate= 13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent events==

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:policemen and flowers.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Non-violent protesters face armed policemen, presenting flowers]] --&gt;
'''STUHA''' (Studentské hnutí – a Czech student movement; also the [[Czech language|Czech]] word for '[[ribbon]]') was an alternative, [[independent student movement]] in the late phase of the [[Communist regime in Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak Communist régime]]. It was gradually formed by [[Prague]] students in the late spring and early summer of 1989. The movement was the catalyst that mobilized the university students, later culminating in the demonstration and march at Albertov, [[Prague]], and then on to the city centre, on 17 November 1989.

==History==
[[Image:Karel Hynek Macha statue.jpeg|thumb|left|220px| A meeting point of STUHA creators in front of statue of Karel Hynek Mácha in Petřín Park, Prague – 9. 11. 1989]]
The Stuha movement was formed in summer 1989,&lt;ref&gt;Jan Vidím o hnutí Stuha (Jan Vidím on the Stuha movement; in Czech&lt;/ref&gt; largely at the initiative of former classmates of a [[technical school]] (Střední Průmyslová škola strojnická Praha), in Betlémská ulice, Prague: Marek Benda and [[Jiří Dienstbier Jr.|Jiří Dienstbier Jr]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Marek Benda, Monika Pajerová, Milan Růžička, [[Václav Klaus]] ([[Preface]]) ''Studenti psali revoluci'' (Students wrote the revolution). [[Prague]], 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Other now well-known figures who took part in the formation of the group were [[Šimon Pánek]] and Jan Vidím. The aim of the movement was to push for visible democratic [[social change|change]] in the [[Communist regime in Czechoslovakia|Communist régime]]. With the collapse of the régime following the demonstrations, and with the emergence of new problems and topics and the dramatic differentiation of the new situation, the work of Stuha gradually lost importance and eventually came to a halt in the early weeks of 1990. The differentiation of the politics and [[ideologies]] of the main actors, as well as their getting involved in specific political activities, also led to the winding down of the movement. Three of the main founders soon became deputies to the new [[Federal Assembly (Czechoslovakia)|Federal Assembly]] (the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] parliament). 

Before that the leading figures of the STUHA movement had met on 9 November 1989 (the day the great 19th century[[Czech poetry|Czech poet]], [[Karel Hynek Mácha]], is traditionally commemorated at his monument in Petřín park, Prague), with the aim of getting in touch with the leaders of the [[Socialist Union of Youth|Socialist Youth Organization]] (Socialistický svaz mládeže – SSM) and winning over SSM members who were willing to take part in a mass demonstration for democratization of the régime. This new strategy became the source of conflict within Stuha, but was ultimately pushed through and contributed importantly to the success of the movement for democratic change.

It was very likely STUHA that had considerable influence on the course of events during the student march from Albertov up the hill to the Vyšehrad national cemetery and then, without permission, to the centre of Prague on the evening of 17 November 1989. And it is probably the moderation of this determined group that was reflected in the character and course of the first phase of the public demonstrations and their gradual [[radicalization]]. In November 1989, the secret police considered the activity of the Stuha movement to be very important and rather dangerous to the régime. The secret police monitored the role and work of [[Jiří Dienstbier Jr.]], Marek Benda, and [[Ladislav Lis]], in organizing and moderating the demonstration at Albertov.

==Aims and achievements==
Among the important work of the STUHA movement was the awakening of the student body and its interest in [[civil liberties]], human rights, and genuine democratization of the country. The aim was also to create another link between the dissident movement and students of what has popularly been called the 'grey zone' (people who did not support the régime but who did not openly come out against it).

The '''Teatro Olimpico''' ("Olympic Theatre") is a theatre in [[Vicenza]], northern [[Italy]], constructed in 1580-1585. The theatre was the final design by the Italian Renaissance architect [[Andrea Palladio]] and was not completed until after his death. The [[trompe-l'œil]] onstage scenery, designed by [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]], to give the appearance of long streets receding to a distant horizon, was installed in 1585 for the very first performance held in the theatre, and is the oldest surviving [[theatrical scenery|stage set]] still in existence.  The full Roman-style ''scaenae frons'' back screen across the stage is made from wood and [[stucco]] imitating marble. It was the home of the '''''Accademia Olimpica''''', which was founded there in 1555.

The Teatro Olimpico is, along with the [[Teatro all'antica]] in [[Sabbioneta]] and the [[Teatro Farnese]] in [[Parma]], one of only three Renaissance theatres remaining in existence. Both these theatres were based, in large measure, on the Teatro Olimpico.  It is still used several times a year.

Since 1994, the Teatro Olimpico, together with other Palladian buildings in and around Vicenza, has been part of  the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] [[City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto]].

===Palladio's vision===
The Teatro Olimpico is the last work by Palladio, and ranks amongst his highest masterworks. The Vicentine architect had returned to his native city in 1579, bringing with him a lifetime of detailed study into all aspects of Roman architecture, and a more detailed understanding of the architecture of classical theatre than any other living person. Palladio had illustrated [[Daniele Barbaro|Daniele Barbaro's]] Italian translation of [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De architectura]]''; the prints for this edition include floorplans for Roman theatres and an elevation for the ''[[scaenae frons]]'' of Vicenza's ruined Roman theatre, the ''[[Teatro Berga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced in Gino Nogara, ''Cronache degli spettacoli nel Teatro Olimpico di Vicenza dal 1580 al 1970''. Vicenza: Accademia Olimpica, 1972, Plate 6 (following p. 418).&lt;/ref&gt; As well, Palladio's papers include plans for the imagined reconstruction of the ruined Roman theatres in [[Pula|Pola]]&lt;ref&gt;Licisco Magagnato, "The Genesis of the ''Teatro Olimpico''", in ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol XIV (1951), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Verona]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Palladio, a founder of the Olympic Academy (the ''Accademia Olimpica'', created in 1555), had already designed temporary theatre structures at various locations in the city. The most notable of these had been erected some seventeen years previously in the great hall of the [[Basilica Palladiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Licisco Magagnato, "The Genesis of the ''Teatro Olimpico''", in ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol XIV (1951), p. 217. The original documents which record the existence of this temporary theatre are in the records of the Accademia Olimpico at the Biblioteca Beroliana in Vicenza.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1579 the Academy obtained the rights to build a permanent theatre in an old fortress, the ''Castello del Territorio,'' which had been turned into a prison and powder magazine before falling into disuse. Palladio was asked to produce a design, and despite the awkward shape of the old fortress, he decided to use the space to recreate an academic reconstruction of the Roman theatres that he had so closely studied. In order to fit a stage and seating area into the wide, shallow space, it was necessary for Palladio to flatten the semicircular seating area of the Roman theatre into an ellipse.

===Scamozzi takes over===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
Palladio died in August 1580, only six months after construction had started on the theatre. Despite this setback, construction continued, with Palladio's sketches and drawings serving as a guide, and Palladio's son, Silla, taking charge of the project. Soon, the other prominent Vicentine architect, [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]], was called upon to complete the project.

Scamozzi had already stepped in to complete Palladio's other great unfinished project, the villa just east of Vicenza that is today known as [[Villa Capra "La Rotonda"|''La Rotonda'']]. It is a mark of Scamozzi's genius that both these projects are today regarded as being among Palladio's most successfully executed works.

Scamozzi's contributions include the ''Odèo'' and ''Antiodèo'' rooms, as well as the entrance archway which leads from the street, through an old medieval wall into the courtyard of the old fortress.

In order to make the archway fit with its surroundings, and to prepare visitors to the theatre for the transformation from medieval to classical surroundings, Scamozzi built the archway to be the same size and shape as the ''porta reggia'' or triumphal arch at the center of the ''scaenae frons'' or rear wall of the stage. However, the entrance archway was [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] to make it fit with the rough and well-worn wall into which it was being inserted.

However, Scamozzi's most famous and most original contribution to the theatre was his elaborate stage set, with its remarkable [[trompe l'œil]] street views. He not only designed the sets, but also put considerable effort into designing the lighting that permitted the make-believe houses of the stage scenery to be lit from within, completing the illusion that these were real streets.

===Design and construction of the scenery===
Aside from a single sketch of the ''scaenae frons'', Palladio left no plans as to what kind of scenery should be used onstage. His illustration of an idealized Roman scaenae frons for Barbaro's edition of Vitruvius had shown perspective street views similar to those which would later be built in the Teatro Olimpico. But the sketch of the proposed scaenae frons for the Teatro Olimpico shows no such street scenes; the space behind the central archway and the doors to each side is blank.

The simplest explanation for the absence of any street scenes in this drawing is that the Academy had not yet obtained the land on which the scenery would later be built. This land was acquired in 1582, after Scamozzi had taken charge of the project. This made it possible to extend the building (including a special [[apse]]-shaped projection to accommodate the longest and most elaborate of the seven street views). The Academy's petition to the city government for the additional land anticipated that if acquired, the space would be used to create perspective scenery; it explains that the extra land would be used to build a theatre "along the lines laid out by our colleague Palladio, who has designed it to permit perspective views."&lt;ref&gt;Licisco Magagnato, "The Genesis of the ''Teatro Olimpico'', in ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol. XIV (1951), p. 216, 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, Palladio can be given credit for having inspired the remarkable perspectives which are visible to the audience through the central archway of the scaenae frons (also known as the "porta reggia") and also through the smaller side openings. But it is also appropriate to regard Scamozzi as the technical genius behind their remarkably successful execution.

Scamozzi's stage set was the first practical introduction of perspective views into [[History of theatre#Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theatre]].  The scenery consists of seven hallways decorated to create the illusion of looking down the streets of a city from classical antiquity. Ancient [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], was to be the setting for the first play staged in the theatre. A set of seven extraordinarily realistic ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' false perspectives provide the illusion of long street views, while actually the sets recede only a few meters. The way in which seats in all parts of the theatre were provided with at least one perspective view can be seen by observing the theatre floorplan and following the sight lines of audience members in different parts of the theatre.

{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
The theatre was inaugurated on March 3, 1585, with a production of [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mullin|first=Donald|title=The Development of the Playhouse|date=1970|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California, USA|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the theatre was virtually abandoned after only a few productions. The scenes, which had been created in wood and stucco for ''Oedipus Rex'', and which were meant to represent the streets of Thebes, were never removed: despite bombings and other vicissitudes, they have miraculously preserved into modern times. The original lighting system of glass oil lamps, designed by Scamozzi, heightened the illusion of space, has been used only a few times because of the high cost and the risk of fire. Scamozzi's lighting system was used when, in 1997, the theatre was again employed for a production of ''Oedipus Rex''.

The Teatro Olimpico is still used for plays and musical performances, but audience sizes are limited to 400, for conservation reasons. Performances take place in two theatre seasons{{mdash}}classical plays in the autumn and the festival ''Il Suono dell'Olimpico'' in the spring. It is not equipped with heating or air conditioning, which could damage the delicate wooden structures.

The Theatre has been used as a filming location for films such as ''[[Don Giovanni (1979 film)|Don Giovanni]]'' (1979) and  ''[[Casanova (2005 film)|Casanova]]'' (2005).

==Precursors==
Some authors have incorrectly stated that when the Teatro Olimpico was constructed in 1580-1585, it was the first purpose-built theatre in Europe in over a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;For example: "The Teatro Olimpico certainly was a landmark work. It was the first true theatre built after over a thousand years." Susan Crabtree and Peter Beudert, ''Scenic Art for the Theatre'', p. 241. Also: "[T]he first permanent theatre to be built since antiquity." Dan Cruickshank, ''Sir Banister Fletcher's A History of Architecture'', p. 882.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the theatre was one of a number of new permanent theatres being constructed at the time. Records show that permanent theatres were constructed in Ferrara (1531), Rome (1545), Mantua (1549), Bologna (1550), Siena (1561), and Venice (1565). This last theatre was designed by Palladio himself, for the Compagnia della Calza.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Nikolaus Pevsner]], ''A History of Building Types''. London: Thames and Hudson, 1976, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Over the centuries, the Teatro Olimpico has had many admirers, but relatively few imitators. One critic has observed, "In the history of theatre design, the Teatro Olimpico was a temporary hiatus, for succeeding generations adopted the proscenium arch and painterly stage sets. Palladio's ideas are closer to the spirit of the modern theatre, which favors the relationship of audience to action."&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Constant, ''The Palladio Guide''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton Architectural Press, 1985, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Another notes, "The rigid form of the scenic arrangements of the Teatro Olimpico...precluded any further development," and that the theatre was, in a sense, a prisoner of its creators' emphasis on "considerations of archaeology" and truthfulness to the Roman model.&lt;ref&gt;James Laver, ''Drama--Its Costume and Decor''. London: The Studio Publications, 1951, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The successful completion of Palladio's experiment in reconstructing the ancient model meant that there was no longer any need to pursue the objective of recovering the Roman past; it was now possible to start making innovations, starting with eliminating the rigid and unchangeable scaenae frons and the unchanging perspective views.

The first theatre to draw inspiration from the Teatro Olimpico, and the one in which its influence is the most obvious, is the [[Teatro all'antica]] in Sabbioneta. This theatre, which was designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi, is sometimes also referred to, somewhat confusingly, as the "Teatro Olimpico",&lt;ref&gt;For example, see ''Knopf Guides: Italy''. New York: Knopf, 2006, p. 265, which says, "Sabbioneta's reputation as a "Little Athens" rests particularly on the beautiful Teatro Olimpico, a masterpiece by Vincenzo Scamozzi...."&lt;/ref&gt; and some of its design elements, including most notably the colonnade behind the seating area and the self-conscious references to ancient Rome, are clearly drawn from the original Teatro Olimpico. However, the elaborate scaenae frons is absent in Sabbioneta, and only a single perspective view, along a single street, is employed onstage. As well, the seating area departs radically from Palladio's elliptical plan (perhaps as a result of the much narrower shape of the building in which the theatre is housed).

The English architect [[Inigo Jones]] visited the Teatro Olimpico shortly after its completion, and took careful notes, in which he expressed particular admiration for the perspective views: "[T]he chief artifice was that whear so ever you sat you saw one of thes Prospects...."&lt;ref&gt;Jones is quoted in James Laver, ''Drama--Its Costume and Decor''. London: The Studio Publications, 1951, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6544">The '''Timpanogos Storytelling Festival''' takes place [[Labor Day]] weekend at the end of each summer in [[Lehi, Utah]]. The festival draws a combined attendance of about 26,000 people each year,&lt;ref&gt;According to the [http://www.timpfest.org festival web site]&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest [[storytelling festival]] in the western United States. The festival typically lasts two days and invites professional storytellers from throughout the United States. Some of the nation's best known storytellers unite with other tellers, both young and old, for two all-day celebrations of music, merriment, but mostly stories.  In addition to daytime performances on Friday and Saturday, there are typically themed public performances in the evenings, such as "Look Who's Talking, "Bedtime Stories," "My Favorite Stories" and "Laughin' Night." Before the main Festival begins, attendees may also attend storytelling workshops held on Thursday, given by some of the featured storytellers.


== History ==
'''The Idea'''-In 1989, Karen Ashton, President of the Friends of the [[Orem Public Library]], was looking for projects to promote community involvement in the Library. Mrs. Ashton had been volunteering at the Library for years, presenting Storytime for preschoolers and helping with other Children's Library programs. When she saw an advertisement for a National Storytelling Festival in Tennessee, she decided to attend and gather more ideas for stories and programs for the [[Orem]] Library.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

She went to the National Festival expecting to find ladies telling stories to children in a library. Instead she found thousands of adults crowding into tents, listening to dynamic performers relating tales of history, culture, folk and family life, as well as magical stories of “what if . . .!” The entire town of [[Jonesborough, Tennessee|Jonesborough]] (population 3,000) had mobilized to accommodate the 10,000+ people who annually attend the three-day festival.

Mrs. Ashton recognized in the storytelling festival the idea she was searching for. A festival brings people together and increases understanding by allowing them to communicate through stories. It fosters the simple, old community and family values—family members and neighbors talking with each other again, sharing family history and experiences. A storytelling festival is an active experience, not passive entertainment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}  

'''The Beginning'''-The Friends launched the first Timpanogos Storytelling Festival just eight months after Mrs. Ashton presented the idea. The Ashton family opened their home to the community, set up performance areas on their property, and persuaded neighbors to do the same. Livestock was moved, fields mowed, and tents raised. Three Eastern storytellers of national fame and local talent including [[James Arrington]], [[Marvin Payne]], and [[Gaye Beeson]] performed for two incredible days.

News of the Festival spread rapidly. By the second year the Friends had expanded the hours of the Festival, planned an additional evening performance at [http://www.scera.org/contents/view/16/scera_shell.html], borrowed another field for a fourth performance tent, and invited school groups to the Friday morning performances. Five of the best storytellers in the nation were on the program, and auditions had been held to determine the successful regional tellers. Acoustic musicians performed during the intermissions throughout the day, supplementing performances by storytellers on the fiddle, banjo, harmonica, and spoons.

'''Now'''-The Timpanogos Storytelling Festival has grown each year—in both audience size and prestige. Attendance at annual Festival events total 26,000 and the Festival is recognized throughout the national storytelling world as a standard setter.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} The Festival and its organizers have received national media attention and awards. Storytelling event organizers from around the nation attend the Timpanogos Festival for training. The Timpanogos Storytelling Festival has garnered this reputation not only because of the great talent featured, but also because of the scenic setting, the terrific audience, the extraordinary community support, and its excellence in organization.

In 1999, the [[National Storytelling Network]] honored Karen Ashton with the Leadership Award in recognition of her exemplary leadership and significant contributions to the community through storytelling. In the same year, the [[Utah Storytelling Guild]] (spawned by the Festival and now supporting the Festival) received the National Storytelling Network Service Award. Janet Low, Festival Coordinator, was awarded the Service Award in 2000 and Debi Richan, Festival Vice-President, received this national award in 2004. 

The Festival draws individuals and groups from across the nation and Canada. The [[Utah Valley Visitors Center]] provides material on attractions and accommodations in Utah County to ticket-buyers living outside of Utah and Salt Lake Counties. Families spend vacations in Utah, planned around the Timpanogos Festival. The reputation of the area has spread—even the national storytellers bring their families to spend additional time enjoying the scenery and attractions of Utah County. 

In 2005, the Festival opened at the new [[Mt. Timpanogos Park]] in Provo Canyon. Designed by the City of Orem for the annual Festival, the park allows Festival growth to continue with more and larger performance tents. 

In 2017 The Festival moved locations to Thanksgiving Point's Ashton Gardens. 

The Timpanogos Festival is not a small event. It requires significant donations from businesses and foundations and thousands of volunteer hours from individuals and community groups such as the American Legion, Kiwanis, Golden Kiwanis, youth groups, student clubs, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, and the Utah Storytelling Guild.  

Considering all the work involved with organizing an annual Festival, Karen Ashton commented, "If just one family leaves the Festival and begins to share stories with each other, it will be worth it."

'''''Vreme''''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] for ''Time'') is a weekly [[news magazine]] based in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].

==History==

===Launch===
In 1990, dissatisfied with the media climate in [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]'s largest constituent unit, a group of liberal Serbian intellectuals, including prominent lawyer [[Srđa M. Popović|Srđa Popović]], decided to start a weekly newsmagazine. Following a seven-month preparation throughout the year, ''Vreme'' was launched with its first issue coming out on 29 October 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Thomas|title=Serbia Under Milošević: Politics in the 1990s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDzmXEDJFX8C&amp;pg=PR15|accessdate=2 August 2015|date=January 1999|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers|isbn=978-1-85065-367-7|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; little over a month before the [[Serbian general election, 1990|1990 general election in SR Serbia]] as the entire country of SFR Yugoslavia was transforming its governance from a [[one-party state|one-party system]] under the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist League]] (SKJ) to a multi-party one.

Most ''Vreme'''s original staff were journalists from ''[[Politika]]'' and ''[[NIN (magazine)|NIN]]''. It characterizes itself as "a magazine without lies, hatred, or prejudice" and has opposed nationalistic mobilization for the [[Yugoslav wars]].&lt;ref name="gordy"&gt;Gordy, Eric D. (1999). ''The Culture of Power in Serbia: Nationalism and the Destruction of Alternatives''. p. 69. Penn State Press. {{ISBN|0-271-01958-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurspahić, Kemal (2003). ''Prime Time Crime: Balkan Media in War and Peace''. p.54. US Institute of Peace Press. {{ISBN|1-929223-38-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is modeled after its U.S. counterparts ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]''.

In 1993, 30,000 copies were produced weekly with a quarter of its sales abroad. ''Vreme'' has established a reputation as one of the most reliable media sources of the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and its writers have been largely cited by international media.&lt;ref name="gordy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Williams, Carol (23 March 1993). "[Magazine Makes Assault on Serbian Nationalism: Scrappy Vreme Has Emerged as Yugoslavia's Most Trusted Chronicle of War]". ''Los Angeles Times''. Accessed 7 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vreme'' has started a number of supplements such as ''Vreme novca'' (Time of Money), ''[[Vreme zabave]]'' (Time for Fun), and has become a publishing house. The newspaper has an international edition called ''Vreme International'', which is mainly targeted at the [[Serbian diaspora]] in Europe.

'''Wildlife Conservation Film Festival''' (WCFF) is an international film festival based in New York, that promotes and produces interactive events around independent films that promote sustainability and the conservation of biodiversity.

==About WCFF==

The Wildlife Conservation Film Festival was founded in 2010 by Christopher J. Gervais as a 2 day event and has now grown to a 10 day festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Updates|first1=Industry|title=DDB NY get sexually creative for the Wildlife Conservation Film Festival|url=https://creativepool.com/magazine/advertising/ddb-ny-get-sexually-creative-for-the-wildlife-conservation-film-festival.8708|work=Creative Pool|date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a juried event and 
attendees and participants are international wildlife conservationists, filmmakers, photographers, scientists and people across the globe that work toward the preservation of global [[biodiversity]]. It has grown into a educational conference in which attendees are informed and inspired. In 2016 WCFF announced that [[DDB Worldwide]] (New York) will be partnering with them on a [[pro bono]] basis in order to further their exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zanger|first1=Doug|title=DDB New York named Wildlife Conservation Film Festival AOR|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/03/28/ddb-new-york-named-wildlife-conservation-film-festival-aor|work=The Drum|publisher=Carnyx Group Limited|date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ancient but originally minor state that already existed during the late [[Shang dynasty]], Xu was subjugated by the [[Western Zhou|Western]] [[Zhou dynasty]] around 1039 BC, and was gradually [[sinification|sinified]] from then on. It eventually regained its independence and formed a [[confederation]] of 36 states that became powerful enough to challenge the Zhou empire for supremacy over the [[Zhongyuan|Central Plain]]. Able to consolidate its rule over a territory that stretched from [[Hubei]] in the south, through eastern [[Henan]], northern Anhui and Jiangsu, as far north as southern [[Shandong]],{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1999|p=324}} Xu's confederation remained a major power until the early [[Spring and Autumn period]].{{sfnp|Li|2006|pp=135-137}}{{sfnp|Fox Brindley|2015|p=70}} It reached its apogee in the mid 8th century BC, expanding its influence as far as [[Zhejiang]] in the south.{{sfnp|Fox Brindley|2015|p=70}} By that time, however, Xu's confederation began to break up as result of internal unrest. As its power waned, Xu was increasingly threatened by neighboring states, losing control over the Huai River to [[Chu (state)|Chu]]. Reduced to its heartland, Xu was eventually conquered by [[Wu (state)|Wu]] in 512 BC.{{sfnp|Deng|2008|p=33}}

==History==

=== Origin and Zhou rule ===
[[File:Yugong Nine Provinces Map 禹贡九州图.svg|thumb|left|Xu was reported by later chronicles to have covered a large area between the [[Huai River|Huai]] and [[Yellow River]] during the legendary [[Xia dynasty]].]]

According to the ''[[Rongcheng Shi]]'' [[bamboo slips]] from the [[Warring States period]], the ''[[Yu Gong]]'' from the [[Han dynasty]] and various other sources, [[Yu the Great]] divided the world into the [[Nine Provinces (China)|Nine Provinces]] in prehistoric times, one of them [[Xu Province|Xu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.jianbo.org/Wssf/2003/yanchanggui01.htm 上博简《容成氏》九州柬释] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303164141/http://www.jianbo.org/Wssf/2003/yanchanggui01.htm |date=March 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.jianbo.org/Wssf/2003/zhuyuanqing03.htm 禹画九州论] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303164147/http://www.jianbo.org/Wssf/2003/zhuyuanqing03.htm |date=March 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Wu|1990|p=41}} The ''[[Yuanhe Xingzuan]]'', a [[Tang dynasty]] compilation of information on the origins of [[Chinese surname]]s, as well as the ''[[Tongzhi (book)|Tongzhi]]'', a Southern [[Song dynasty]] historical book, also state that Yu enfeoffed [[Ruomu]], grandson of the [[Chinese mythology|mythological]] [[Emperor of China|emperor]] [[Zhuanxu]], as lord of Xu around 2100 BC. In turn the Xu peoples were supposed to be Ruomu's descendants. Furthermore, it was claimed this Xu state or province had originally occupied the entire area between the Huai and [[Yellow River]].{{sfnp|Maspero|1978|p=7}} No contemporary evidence exists to verify this information and the oldest literary sources available, the [[oracle bone]]s of the Shang dynasty, do not mention such an empire. As result, the stories of Xu's foundation remain legendary.

Nevertheless, archaeological excavations have proven that the area around modern-day [[Xuzhou]], including the later heartland of Xu, was a major trading hub and cultural centre for the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]], [[Dawenkou culture|Dawenkou]] and [[Longshan culture]]s since the 3rd millennium BC.{{sfnp|Wu|1990|pp=41-44}} Oracle bones and later historical records both indicate that the Xuzhou area was occupied by the indigenous [[Dapeng (state)|Dapeng kingdom]] since the middle Shang dynasty. A powerful polity, Dapeng was eventually destroyed by the Shang under [[King Zhou of Shang|King Di Xin]].{{sfnp|Wu|1990|p=44}} In turn, Xu's existence is first reliably reported by the ''[[Yi Zhou Shu]]'' for 1042 BC, only a few decades after Dapeng's fall.{{sfnp|Li|2006|p=307}} It remains unknown if these two polities were related in any way.

At the time of its first recorded appearance, Xu was already a powerful [[Hua–Yi distinction|Yi]] state that was probably located in southeastern Shandong or northwestern Jiangsu.{{sfnp|Sawyer|2013|pp=152, 153}} Besides this state, a number of small Xu enclaves existed in western Shandong.{{sfnp|Maspero|1978|p=7}}&lt;ref name="BOOK I.

Ralph D. Sawyer speculates that Xu joined the rebels because it did not wanted to alienate its neighboring states that had co-founded the rebel alliance.{{sfnp|Sawyer|2013|p=148}} The rebels eventually lost the war, and as result the Huai River valley was invaded and subjugated by the Zhou royal army in 1039 BC.{{sfnp|Li|2006|pp=306, 307}} To what extent Xu was also defeated during that campaign remains unclear; reports in the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' and the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' make it likely that Xu forces continued to resist the implementation of Zhou power in southeastern Shandong. After the foundation of [[Lu (state)|Lu]], Xu and other Huaiyi statelets reportedly attacked the new Zhou state until [[Bo Qin]] defeated them.{{sfnp|Sawyer|2013|pp=180, 181}} Afterwards, the Xu state appears to have been largely pacified and became a vassal of the Zhou dynasty. In this position, it was strongly influenced by the Zhou culture and also served as link to the dynasty's southernmost ally, [[Wu (state)|Wu]].{{sfnp|Li|2006|p=324}} Despite that, Xu remained somewhat defiant, and moved its core area further south into northern Anhui in order to escape the constant pressure from the Zhou dynasty in the north.{{sfnp|Sawyer|2013|pp=152, 153}}{{sfnp|So|1994|pp=200}} The Xu enclaves in western Shandong even continued to openly resist, but most of them were destroyed by Lu and [[Song (state)|Song]] over time.{{sfnp|Maspero|1978|p=7}}

=== Rise to power ===
After its subjugation, the state of Xu was forced to remain a vassal of the Zhou dynasty for almost one hundred years.{{sfnp|Li|2006|p=324}} The turning point came in the mid 10th century BC: Around 957 BC, the Zhou dynasty lost a disastrous [[Zhou–Chu War|war]] against [[Chu (state)|Chu]]. This defeat appears to have thrown the dynasty into chaos.{{sfnp|Li|2006|pp=93-95}} Based on archaeological findings, [[Edward L. Shaughnessy]] even speculates that the Zhou dynasty was so weakened that it largely retreated to its capital area, leaving most of its empire to fend for itself.{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1991|pp=323-325}} Building upon this theory, Manfred Frühauf believes that the Huaiyi, among them Xu, regained their independence as consequence of this general Zhou retreat.{{sfnp|Frühauf|2008|p=21}} Regardless of whether this was the case, by 944 BC, Xu and the Huaiyi had definitely regained their independence, as Lord Yan of Xu managed to unite thirty-six Dongyi and Huaiyi states under his leadership, declared himself king and proceeded to invade the Zhou empire.{{sfnp|Sawyer|2013|p=199}}{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1999|p=324}} The reasons for this invasion are unknown, but Frühauf speculates that it was a preventive strike to prevent the Zhou from restoring their domination over the Huaiyi,{{sfnp|Frühauf|2008|p=21}} while Sawyer considers it possible that the Xu either wanted to plunder the Zhou royal domain or aimed to supplant the Zhou rule and establish their own dynasty.{{sfnp|Sawyer|2013|p=200}} The course and scale of the invasion are equally controversial, based on different interpretations of bronze inscriptions and historical texts. It is even disputed if there was just one or two invasions. Generally agreed, however, is the result of the attacks: Even though the Zhou forces had eventually succeeded in driving the invaders back, they could not subjugate the Huaiyi again and were forced to acknowledge their independence in a peace treaty.{{sfnp|Sawyer|2013|pp=199-203}}{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1999|pp=323-325}}{{sfnp|Li|2006|pp=96, 97}}{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1991|pp=250-254}} If records in the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'', probably based upon early texts of the ''Bamboo Annals'', are to believed, Xu was particularly strengthened by the war. Recognizing that he could not defeat the Huaiyi, [[King Mu of Zhou]] recognized King Yan of Xu as overlord over a large confederation that covered most of the Huai River valley and regions south of it. As result, Xu became the new major power of the east and a serious political rival to the Zhou dynasty.{{sfnp|Li|2006|pp=96, 97}}{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1999|pp=323-325}} The ''Zuo Zhuan'' suggests that this confederation also included the remaining Xu enclaves in western Shandong.&lt;ref name="BOOK I. DUKE YIN. - II. Second year." /&gt; In the course of its political ascent, Xu's cultural influence began to spread as far as the [[Yangtze]] delta region.{{sfnp|Fox Brindley|2015|p=70}}

=== Apogee ===
Xu maintained its dominance over the southeast after King Mu's death, while the armistice proved inadequate to ensure peace. The military contest between the Huaiyi and Zhou kingdom never really stopped, and even though the latter increasingly suffered from internal disorder and even chaos, it remained a formidable adversary for Xu's confederation. [[King Li of Zhou]] (857-842/28){{efn|Li effectively ruled only until 842 BC, when he was forced into exile; nevertheless, he remained official king until 828 BC.{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1999|pp=343-345}}}} led several campaigns against the states of the Huai River, such as Jiao and Yu. In turn, the Huaiyi confederation under Xu began a massive counter offensive in 850 BC, aiming to conquer the [[North China Plain]] and to destroy the Zhou rule over the East. Allied with Ehou, rebellious ruler of [[E (state)|E]], and the Dongyi states, the Huaiyi brought the Zhou dynasty to the brink of destruction. Their forces even reached the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo]] and [[Yi River (Henan)|Yi River]] valleys, threatening{{sfnp|Li|2006|pp=103-105}} or even plundering&lt;ref name="Yi" /&gt; the dynasty's [[Crown land|royal domain]]. Eventually, however, the anti-Zhou alliance collapsed after the destruction of E by Zhou loyalists, and Xu was driven back.{{sfnp|Li|2006|pp=103-105}}

War was renewed under [[King Xuan of Zhou]], who aimed to restabilize and restore the Zhou kingdom. Enlisting the military aid of several loyalist states of Shandong, he launched a massive campaign against the Xu-led Huaiyi coalition in 822 BC, eventually claiming to have won a great victory.{{sfnp|Sawyer|2013|pp=229, 230}}{{sfnp|Li|2006|pp=135-138}} The ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' even boasted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The region of Hsü [Xu] is shaken without interruption, 
it trembles in terror, the region of Hsü
as before the rolling and the bursts of thunder,
the region of Hsü trembles for terror!{{sfnp|Maspero|1978|p=58}}
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Notwithstanding these claims, Xuan's expedition probably did not result in a total victory, as Xu does not appear to have been severely weakened during this period. It is more likely that the war ended with a minor Zhou victory or a peace treaty, with tributes sent by the Huaiyi to King Xuan for his remaining reign.{{sfnp|Sawyer|2013|pp=152, 153}}{{sfnp|Li|2006|pp=135-138}} According to the ''[[Yu Gong]]'', Xu sent [[pheasant]] [[Plume (feather)|plumes]] and sounding stones as regular tributes.{{sfnp|Maspero|1978|pp=62, 63}}

Despite Xuan's restoration attempts, the Zhou dynasty's royal power largely collapsed in 771 BC, ushering into the Spring and Autumn period. Initially, Xu not only retained its power during this new era of warfare and chaos, but probably further expanded into the south. Xu bronzes from the early Spring and Autumn period were found in southern Jiangsu and northern [[Zhejiang]], indicating the state's influence in or possibly even control over these regions.{{sfnp|Fox Brindley|2015|p=70}}{{sfnp|von Falkenhausen|1999|p=538}} Around this time, however, Xu also began to suffer from serious internal unrest, resulting in the gradual disintegration of its confederation. Several polities seceded: The Xu enclaves of western Shandong aligned themselves with the state of [[Lu (state)|Lu]] in 720 BC,&lt;ref name="BOOK I. DUKE YIN. - II. Second year." /&gt; the Shu peoples formed independent states,{{efn|The Shu states (舒) were a group of minor city-states belonging to a single Xu-related tribal group&lt;ref name="Yi" /&gt; that were located between central&lt;ref name="BOOK V.

The Xu rulers had also adopted the "[[Chinese nobility#Peer ranks of the Zhou dynasty|zǐ]]" title (子){{efn|name=fn1}} for themselves by this time, thereby integrating themselves into the recognized Zhou system. While seen as inferior barbarian title by Zhou states, the Xu rulers took "zǐ" as synonymous with "king".{{sfnp|Li|2008|pp=116, 119-122}}&lt;ref name="BOOK III. DUKE ZHUANG. - XXVI. Twenty-sixth year." /&gt;

=== Conflict with the northern states ===
Despite its confederation's end, the Xu kingdom still held considerable power, so that the dukes Yin and [[Duke Huan of Lu|Huan]] of Lu tried to remain "on good terms with [the Xu peoples]". Their successor, Duke Zhuang of Lu, on the other side, considered the remaining Xu tribes of Shandong a threat and started a war to eliminate them. By that time, the only remaining northern Xu enclave of any significance was centered at [[Cao County|Caozhou]], holding the local marshes from where the [[Chi River (Hanshui)|Chi River]] originated.&lt;ref name="BOOK III. DUKE ZHUANG. - XXVI. Twenty-sixth year." /&gt;{{sfnp|Maspero|1978|pp=7, 8}} According to the ''Zuo Zhuan'', the continued raiding activities of the Caozhou-Xu were responsible for the war.&lt;ref name="BOOK III. DUKE ZHUANG. - XXVI. Twenty-sixth year." /&gt;{{sfnp|Maspero|1978|p=185}} Duke Zhuang was able to gain the military assistance of [[Song (state)|Song]], [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]], and, most importantly, the powerful state of [[Qi (state)|Qi]]. On the other side, the Xu of Shandong allied with the Xu kingdom. Qi first attacked the Xu of Shandong in 674 BC, but failed to subdue them. In 668, the Qi-led coalition launched not only another assault on Caozhou, but also invaded Xu's territory in the Huai River valley. While the latter state remained undefeated, the Caozhou-Xu were destroyed,&lt;ref name="BOOK III. DUKE ZHUANG. - XXVI. Twenty-sixth year." /&gt; and with them, the last remnants of Xu rule in Shandong.{{sfnp|Maspero|1978|pp=7, 8}}

Beginning in 655 BC, the state of Chu began to expand into the Huai River valley,{{sfnp|Cook; Major|1999|p=16}} causing several local Huaiyi polities such as the Shu states to ally with it in order to profit from its military assistance. In response to this aggressive expansion into its heartland, the Xu kingdom began to cooperate with Chu's northern enemies, and occupied one of the now-hostile Shu states in 656 BC.&lt;ref name="BOOK V. DUKE XI. - III. Third year." /&gt;{{sfnp|Miller|2015|p=87}} Chu retaliated in 645 BC, and launched an invasion of Xu.{{sfnp|Maspero|1978|p=188}} [[Duke Huan of Qi]], hegemon of China at that time, organised an alliance of Qi, Lu, Song, [[Chen (state)|Chen]], [[Wey (state)|Wey]], [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]], [[Cao (state)|Cao]], and Xǔ to aid Xu. They sent an expedition to relieve the small kingdom, but the anti-Chu alliance was decisively defeated during the [[Battle of Loulin]].&lt;ref name="BOOK V. DUKE XI. - XV. Fifteenth year."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/chunqiu.xml&amp;style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&amp;chunk.id=d2.11&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d2.16&amp;doc.lang=bilingual |title= BOOK V.

Fifteenth year. |work=[[Zuo Zhuan]] |author=[[Zuo Qiuming]] |language=Chinese, English| accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it was not destroyed and continued to fight for its independence, Xu was severely weakened, marking the beginning of its final decline.{{sfnp|Fox Brindley|2015|p=70}}{{sfnp|Miller|2015|pp=99-101}}

With Xu's decline, other states of the Huai River began to grow in power. In its direct vicinity, the state of Zhongli grew into "one of the most important regional states of the [river's] middle reaches".{{sfnp|Kan ''et al.''|2009|p=37}} Sometime between 644 and 600 BC, its ruler, Lord Bai, defeated Xu in battle.{{sfnp|Anhui Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology and Bengbu Museum|2015|pp=75, 83, 85}} In 643 BC, Xu and its ally Qi invaded Yingshi in [[Lu'an]], a vassal state of Chu. According to Zuo Qiuming, "this expedition was undertaken by Qi in the interest of Xu, to avenge (...) the defeat of Xu by Chu at Loulin".&lt;ref name="BOOK V. DUKE XI. - XVII. Seventeenth year."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/chunqiu.xml&amp;style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&amp;chunk.id=d2.11&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d2.16&amp;doc.lang=bilingual |title= BOOK V. DUKE XI. - XVII. Seventeenth year. |work=[[Zuo Zhuan]] |author=[[Zuo Qiuming]] |language=Chinese, English| accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After 622 BC, Chu forced the remaining states along the middle Huai River into vassalage, destroying any of them that continued open resistance. It also concluded a pact with Wu and [[Yue (state)|Yue]], "which kept them from wooing the Shu states for a quarter century". As result, Chu became the unchallenged ruler of most of the Huai River valley,{{sfnp|Cook; Major|1999|p=16}} so that Xu increasingly fell under Chu's influence as well. Despite this, the extremely weakened kingdom continued to conspire with other states against Chu.&lt;ref name="BOOK X. DUKE ZHAO. - XVI.

Chu's dominance over the Huai River valley was broken in 584 BC, when Wu launched a large-scale western offensive,{{sfnp|Cook; Major|1999|p=16}} during which Xu was also attacked by Wu forces.&lt;ref name="BOOK VIII. DUKE CHENG. - VII. Seventh year"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/chunqiu.xml&amp;style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&amp;chunk.id=d2.14&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d2.16&amp;doc.lang=bilingual |title=BOOK VIII. DUKE CHENG. - VII. Seventh year |work=[[Zuo Zhuan]] |author=[[Zuo Qiuming]] |language=Chinese, English| accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, Wu and Chu constantly fought each other for supremacy over the Huai River valley,{{sfnp|Cook; Major|1999|p=16}} while nearly nothing is recorded of Xu for this period.&lt;ref name="BOOK X. DUKE ZHAO. - XVI. Sixteenth year." /&gt;

Since 542 BC, Xu became inclined to side against Chu with Wu in order to regain its full independence,&lt;ref name="BOOK X. DUKE ZHAO. - XVI. Sixteenth year." /&gt; with King Yichu&lt;ref name="BOOK X. DUKE ZHAO. - VI. Sixth year"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/chunqiu.xml&amp;style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&amp;chunk.id=d2.16&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d2.16&amp;doc.lang=bilingual |title=BOOK X. DUKE ZHAO. - VI. Sixth year |work=[[Zuo Zhuan]] |author=[[Zuo Qiuming]] |language=Chinese, English| accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; marrying a Wu princess. This new alliance resulted in grave consequences for Xu in 539 BC. In that year, [[King Ling of Chu]] called for meeting of the states at the former capital of [[Shen (state)|Shen]], wanting them to accept him as new hegemon of China. Although hostile to Chu, Xu's ruler was obliged to be present at the meeting as he feared a possible retaliation. At Shen, however, Chu's ruler had Yichu seized because of his close connections to Wu.&lt;ref name="BOOK X. DUKE ZHAO. - IV. Fourth year"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/chunqiu.xml&amp;style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&amp;chunk.id=d2.16&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d2.16&amp;doc.lang=bilingual |title=BOOK X.

Fourth year |work=[[Zuo Zhuan]] |author=[[Zuo Qiuming]] |language=Chinese, English| accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then compelled Xu to participate in an invasion of Wu in 537 BC.&lt;ref name="BOOK X. DUKE ZHAO. - V.

King Ling of Chu, fearing that Xu would revolt, promptly invaded the small kingdom. Wu came to Xu's aid, however, and defeated Chu's army. Afterwards, Xu openly aligned itself with Wu.&lt;ref name="BOOK X. DUKE ZHAO. - VI. Sixth year" /&gt;

In winter 530 BC, King Ling of Chu led another army to besiege and conquer Xu's capital in order to prepare an invasion of Wu.&lt;ref name="BOOK X. DUKE ZHAO. - Twelfth year"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/chunqiu.xml&amp;style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&amp;chunk.id=d2.16&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d2.16&amp;doc.lang=bilingual |title=BOOK X.

King Ling`s army then almost completely deserted him, while the remaining loyal troops broke off the siege of Xu and began to retreat to Chu, only to be overwhelmed and destroyed by an army of Wu at Yuzhang.&lt;ref name="BOOK X.

In 526 BC, [[Duke Jing of Qi]] wanted to restore Qi's old hegemony, and launched an invasion of Xu. Instead of resisting, Xu's ruler simply submitted and paid tribute to the duke, so that the latter returned to Qi without any fighting. [[Zuo Qiuming]] believed this to be a sign of the small states' increasing weakness, as they no longer had a leader among them capable of resisting invaders who were "devoid of principle".&lt;ref name="BOOK X. DUKE ZHAO. - XVI. Sixteenth year."/&gt;

=== Fall and legacy ===
Eventually, Xu became involved in a succession dispute of Wu in 515 BC, when it sheltered Prince Yanyu from his nephew, [[King Helü of Wu]].&lt;ref name="BOOK X. Duke Zhao - XXVII. Twenty-seventh year"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/chunqiu.xml&amp;style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&amp;chunk.id=d2.16&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d2.16&amp;doc.lang=bilingual |title=BOOK X. Duke Zhao - XXVII. Twenty-seventh year |work=[[Zuo Zhuan]] |author=[[Zuo Qiuming]] |language=Chinese, English| accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Helü ordered Xu to hand the fugitive over,&lt;ref name="BOOK X. Duke Zhao - XXX. Thirtieth year"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/chunqiu.xml&amp;style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&amp;chunk.id=d2.16&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d2.16&amp;doc.lang=bilingual |title=BOOK X. Duke Zhao - XXX. Thirtieth year |work=[[Zuo Zhuan]] |author=[[Zuo Qiuming]] |language=Chinese, English| accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but King Zhangyu of Xu sympathized with Yanyu and let him go.&lt;ref&gt;[[Records of the Grand Historian]]&lt;/ref&gt; Yanyu then fled to the state of Chu, which agreed to help him. Enraged about the course of events, Helü invaded Xu.&lt;ref name="BOOK X. Duke Zhao - XXX. Thirtieth year" /&gt; Aided by the famous military strategist [[Sun Tzu]],{{sfnp|Deng|2008|p=70}} Helü ordered his troops to raise "embankments on the hills so as to lay the [kingdom's] capital under water". Although Chu sent an army to relieve Xu, the situation in the besieged city became unbearable, so that Zhangyu went forth with his wife to personally surrender to King Helü. Hereby, Xu was extinguished.&lt;ref name="BOOK X. Duke Zhao - XXX. Thirtieth year" /&gt;

[[File:Xu Yaoyin Tang Ding.jpg|thumb|right|Bronze ''[[Ding (vessel)|ding]]'' cast by Yin, the ''yaoyin'' (official in charge of sacrifice) of Xu, who was exiled in the [[Yue (state)|Yue kingdom]], unearthed in [[Shaoxing]], 1982. Its 44-character inscription records Yin's ambition to restore the vanquished Xu kingdom.{{sfnp|Chen|2013|p=15}}]]

After Xu's fall, Zhangyu, his family and his most loyal officers were allowed to go into exile to Chu. On the way, they met Chu's army and were escorted to the city of Yi, where Zhangyu took residence.&lt;ref name="BOOK X. Duke Zhao - XXX. Thirtieth year" /&gt; Despite its end, Xu continued to "exert a major influence in the region",{{sfnp|Milburn|2015|p=270}} especially since exiles from the fallen state settled in a large area. Bronze artifacts inscribed by Xu donors were found at sites associated with both [[Yue (state)|Yue]] and Wu, but some were even found at [[Jing'an County|Jing'an]] in northwestern [[Jiangxi]], an area commonly considered a "virtual no-man's land inhabited by unassimilated populations".&lt;ref&gt;http://jiangxi.jxnews.com.cn/system/2009/03/22/011053538.shtml 靖安——古徐国的最后消失地？&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|von Falkenhausen|1999|p=538}}

Those found at Wu sites and dated to the time after Xu's destruction were probably war booty, trading goods or "tokens of political or marriage alliance".{{sfnp|von Falkenhausen|1999|p=538}} The Xu bronzes from [[Shaoxing]] in the Yue kingdom, however, can reliably identified with exiles. Its donor, Yin, had been the ''yaoyin'' (official in charge of sacrifice) of Xu, and stated on one ''[[Ding (vessel)|ding]]'' his ambitions to restore his home state.{{sfnp|Chen|2013|p=15}} An inscription on a halberd of a king of Yue is even interpreted by some scholars as "to aid the Xu state", in which case the Yue government itself desired the restoration of Xu. This interpretation is, however, strongly disputed, with many scholars such as Peng Yushang reading the words as the name of the king.{{sfnp|Peng|2012|p=86}}

== Culture ==
While contemporary and later written records generally considered the people of Xu to be part of the "Huaiyi" or "barbarians of the Huai River", it remains unclear if the Huaiyi were defined on their political opposition to the Zhou dynasty or a shared culture and common ethnicity. Nevertheless, several sinologists, such as Donald B. Wagner, Constance A. Cook, and Barry B. Blakeley consider it likely that the Huaiyi were a specific people, distinct from other groups such as the Dongyi of Shandong and the Nanyi of the middle Yangtze.{{sfnp|Wagner|1996|pp=98, 99}}{{sfnp|Cook; Major|1999|p=4}}  Archaeological excavations seem to corroborate this assumption, as they indicate that the Xu peoples had a distinct indigenous culture which had evolved from local [[Neolithic]] origins.{{sfnp|Anhui Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology and Bengbu Museum|2015|p=82}} As part of the Huaiyi, the Xu peoples were part of a highly developed bronze culture. In fact, the Huaiyi appeared as users of bronze and copper who produced metal weapons, vessels and bells since they were first attested by Zhou sources in the eleventh century BC.{{sfnp|Wagner|1996|pp=99, 100, 106}}

Xu is also commonly associated with the larger Wu-Yue [[cultural area]], on which it exerted a great influence.{{sfnp|Fox Brindley|2015|p=70}}{{sfnp|Milburn|2015|p=270}} In this position it acted as an intermediary for the northern Zhou culture,{{sfnp|Li|2006|p=324}} but also conveyed its own distinct techniques and ideas to the Yangtze delta region.{{sfnp|Milburn|2015|p=270}}{{sfnp|von Falkenhausen|1999|p=538}}

As the people of Xu were not of Shang or Zhou origin, they probably spoke their own language, which might have been related to the largely unknown Yue languages to the south.{{sfnp|Fox Brindley|2015|pp=41-44}} Nevertheless, the Xu elites were well versed in [[Old Chinese]], the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the time, using it to inscribe their bronze vessels.{{sfnp|Chen|2013|p=15}} Besides Old Chinese script, the [[Bird-worm seal script|bird seal script]] was also used. This script was very popular in southeastern China and had evolved from the seal script of the Shang dynasty. Still not completely deciphered, it remains unclear if it was a full-fledged writing system or had a more symbolic purpose. Erica Fox Brindley speculates, however, that regardless of the script texts were only written in Old Chinese.{{sfnp|Fox Brindley|2015|pp=42, 43}}

==Xu in astronomy==
Xu is represented with the star '''[[Theta Serpentis]]''' in asterism ''Left Wall'', [[Heavenly Market enclosure]] (see [[Chinese constellation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0606/ap060623.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 6 月 23 日]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ye''' or '''Yecheng''' ({{zh|t=鄴城|s=邺城|p=Yèchéng|w=Yeh&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-ch'eng&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) was an ancient Chinese city located in what is now [[Linzhang]] County, [[Handan]], [[Hebei]] province and neighbouring [[Anyang]], [[Henan]] province.

Ye was first built in the [[Spring and Autumn period]] by [[Duke Huan of Qi]], and by the time of the [[Warring States period]] the city belonged to the state of [[Wei (state)|Wei]].  Ye was a political and economic center of China during the [[Three Kingdoms Period]] and [[Northern Dynasties]]. It served as the military headquarters of the warlords [[Yuan Shao]] and [[Cao Cao]] in the last years of the [[Han Dynasty|Eastern Han Dynasty]].

[[Shi Le]] made Ye the capital of his [[Later Zhao]] dynasty of the fourth century.&lt;ref name=Rene&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-8135-1304-9 |pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 490s, [[Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei]] moved his capital from Pingcheng (平城, in modern Datong, Shanxi) to Luoyang. This move was not welcomed by all. Antagonism grew between Xiaowen and his sinicized court and those who preferred to cling to the traditional Tuoba tribal ways, and it only increased with further changes calling for the abandonment of Tuoba dress and names. Eventually, under the leadership of Gao Huan (a Chinese general who was Tuoba in his ways and "outlook"&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Cotterell. ''The Imperial Capitals of China: An Inside view of the Celestial Empire''. London: Pimlico, 2007, page 93.&lt;/ref&gt;), the [[sinicization]]-dissenting 'northern garrisons' mutinied and captured Luoyang in 534. "At three days' notice its inhabitants were required to accompany Gao Huan to his own base, the city of Ye...where he declared himself the first Eastern Wei emperor."&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;  "During most of the sixth century Ho-pei [Hebei] [was] the heart of an independent state with its capital at Yeh [Ye]...."&lt;ref&gt;E. G. Pulleyblank. ''The Background of the Rebellion of An Lu-Shan''. Oxford University Press, London Oriental Series, Volume 4., 1966. Page 76.&lt;/ref&gt; It remained the capital of the [[Eastern Wei]] dynasty and the [[Northern Qi Dynasty]] until it was razed to the ground in 580, after [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Yang Jian]], founder of the [[Sui Dynasty]], defeated a resistance force led by [[Yuchi Jiong]], which used Ye as a base of operations.

Some scholars, such as Ku Chi-kuang&lt;ref&gt;"Ku Chi-kuang, "An-Shih Luan ch'ien chih Ho-pei Tao', ''Yen-ching Hsueh-pao'' 19 (1936), pp. 197-209&lt;/ref&gt; believed that Hebei and the region continued to harbour separatist sympathies into the [[Tang Dynasty]]; it was the region from which [[An Lushan]] launched his rebellion during the reign of the Tang [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]].

Extensive excavations of the city have been made in recent years, allowing Chinese historians to make detailed plans of the site. In 2012, archaeologists unearthed nearly 3,000 [[Buddha]] statues during a dig outside Ye. Most of the statues are made of white marble and limestone, and could date back to the Eastern Wei and Northern Qi dynasties (534-577 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/04/pictures/120417-3000-ancient-buddhas-china-world-science/ | title = Pictures: 3,000 Ancient Buddhas Unearthed in China | publisher = National Geographic | date = 2012-04-17 | accessdate = 2012-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
