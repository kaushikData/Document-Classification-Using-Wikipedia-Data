Daqiqi wrote an [[Epic poetry|epic]] history of [[Iran]] which is begun by history of Zarathushtra and Gashtasb.  Questions have been raised as to whether Daqiqi harboured some Zoroastrian beliefs, or was simply promoting [[Sassanian]] cultural trends in the wake of [[Samanid]] domination.&lt;ref&gt;''Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam'', by Joel L. Kraemer, pg. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he is viewed to have been a Zoroastrian convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;E.J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936, Volume 2 By Martijn Theodoor Houtsma, pg. 100&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of couplets by him were included in the epic [[Shahname]] (Book of Kings) by the Persian epic poet [[Ferdowsi]].  Daqiqi was murdered by his favorite slave.&lt;ref&gt;''Classical Persian Literature'', by Arthur John Arberry, pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''''an'''''|案}} is a small [[table (furniture)|table]], desk or platform used during [[Shinto]] ceremonies to bear offerings. It may have four, eight or sixteen legs; the eight-legged variety, called {{nihongo|''hassoku-an'' or ''hakkyaku-an''|八足案, 八脚案||lit. "eight-legged table"}}, is the most common.

==Concepts==

===Stoicism&lt;!--linked from 'Chrysippus'--&gt;===
According to Edward Moore, ''apokatastasis'' was first properly conceptualized in early [[Stoicism|Stoic thought]], particularly by [[Chrysippus]]. The return (''apokatastasis'') of the planets and stars to their proper ''celestial signs'', namely their original positions, would spark a conflagration of the universe (''[[ekpyrosis]]''). The original position was believed to consist of an alignment of celestial bodies with [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]].  Thereafter, from fire, rebirth would commence, and this cycle of alternate destruction and recreation was correlated with a divine [[Logos]]. ''Antapocatastasis'' is a counter-recurrence when the stars and planets align with [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], which would mark destruction by a universal flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Edward | last = Moore | title = Origen of Alexandria and St. Maximus the Confessor | publisher = Universal-Publishers | year = 2005 | pages = 25–27}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics identified Zeus with an alternately expanding and contracting fire constituting the universe. Its expansion was described as Zeus turning his thoughts outwards, resulting in the creation of the material [[cosmos]], and its contraction, the ''apocatastasis'', as Zeus returning to self-contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/o/origen.htm | contribution = Origen of Alexandria (185–254) | title = The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate = September 20, 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Edward |last1= Moore |date=January 2003 | title =Origen of Alexandria and apokatastasis: Some Notes on the Development of a Noble Notion | journal = Quodlibet Journal |volume=5 |issue=1 |issn=1526-6575 |url= http://www.quodlibet.net/articles/moore-origen.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] explored both Stoic and his understanding of Origen's philosophy in two essays written shortly before his death, ''Apokatastasis'' and ''Apokatastasis panton'' (1715).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Allison | last = Coudert | title = Leibniz and the Kabbalah | page = 110 | year = 1995 | quote = Having initially accepted the idea of apocatastasis in the pre-Origen and primarily Stoic sense that this world and everything in it was bound to return again and again in endless cycles of repetition, Leibniz came to embrace Origen's wholly…}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
The concept of "restore" or "return" in the [[Hebrew Bible]] is the common Hebrew verb {{lang|he|[[wikt:שוב|שוב]]}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H7725&amp;t=KJV | contribution = shuwb | type = lexicon and Bible usage | title = Blue letter Bible}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as used in Malachi 4:6, the only use of the verb form of apocatastasis in the Septuagint. This is used in the "restoring" of the fortunes of Job, and is also used in the sense of rescue or return of captives, and in the restoration of Jerusalem.

This is similar to the concept of [[tikkun olam]] in [[Hasidic Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Löwy | title = Redemption and utopia: Jewish libertarian thought in Central Europe: a study in elective affinity | publisher = Stanford University Press | year = 1992 | page = 64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
The word, ''apokatastasis'', appears only once in the New Testament, in Acts 3:21.&lt;ref&gt;Greek: ὃν δεῖ οὐρανὸν μὲν δέξασθαι ἄχρι χρόνων '''ἀποκαταστάσεως''' πάντων ὧν ἐλάλησεν ὁ θεὸς διὰ στόματος τῶν ἁγίων ἀπ᾿ αἰῶνος αὐτοῦ προφητῶν. &lt;br&gt;Vulgate: ''quem oportet caelum quidem suscipere usque in tempora '''restitutionis''' omnium quae locutus est Deus per os sanctorum suorum a saeculo prophetarum''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter healed a beggar with a disability and then addressed the astonished onlookers. His sermon set Jesus in the Jewish context, the fulfiller of the [[Covenant (biblical)|Abrahamic Covenant]], and says:
{{quote|1={{small|[19]}} Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; {{small
|[20]}} And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: {{small
|[21]}} Whom the heaven must receive until the times of '''restitution''' of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.|2={{bibleverse||Acts|3:19-21|KJV}} KJV}}

Grammatically, the [[relative pronoun]] "ὧν" ("of which", [[Ancient Greek grammar|genitive plural]]), could refer to "χρόνων" ("of times"), in which case the central phrase would mean "till a restitution of all times of which God spake", or to "πάντων" ("of all" or "of all things"), meaning "till times of a restitution of all things of which God spake".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Darrell L | last = Bock | title = Acts | year = 2007 | quote = The relative pronoun ὧν (''hon'', of which) could refer back to "the seasons" of which God spoke (Bauernfeind 1980: 69) or to "all things" of which God spoke (so Conzelmann 1987: 29; Barrett 1994: 206, nearest referent).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual view taken of Peter's use of the "''apokatastasis'' of all the things about which God spoke" is that it refers to the restoration of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] and/or the [[Garden of Eden]] and not "all things that ever existed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fitzmyer | title = The Acts of the Apostles | series = The Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries | pages = 283–93}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The verbal form of ''apokatastasis'' is found in the [[Septuagint]] [[Malachi]] 3:23LXX (i.e. {{bibleverse ||Malachi|4:6|ESV}}), a prophecy of [[Elijah]] ''turning back'' the hearts of the children to their fathers; in {{bibleverse ||Matthew|17:11|ESV}} ("he will ''restore'' all things"), echoing Malachi, and in {{bibleverse ||Hebrews|13:19|9}} ("that I may be ''restored'' to you the sooner").

Nineteenth-century German theologian [[Jakob Christoph Rudolf Eckermann|Jakob Eckermann]] interpreted "the 'apocatastasis of all things' to mean the universal emendation of religion by the doctrine of Christ, and the 'times of refreshing' to be the day of renewal, the times of the Messiah."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, Volume 8 | first1 = John | last1 = McClintock | first2 = James | last2 = Strong |publisher=Harper |year=1879 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTotAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1051#v=onepage&amp;q=Eckermann%20%22universal%20emendation%20of%20religion%22&amp;f=false |page=1051 |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patristic Christianity===
The significance of ''apocatastasis'' in early Christianity is today being re-evaluated.  In particular it is now questioned whether [[Origen]], often listed as the most notable advocate of [[universal salvation]], did in fact teach or believe in such a doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Crouzel | first = Henri | title = Origen | year = 1990 | page = 285}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Root |first=JR | contribution = Universalism |title=EDT | editor-first = WA | editor-last = Elwell | edition=2nd |location=Grand Rapids | publisher= Baker |year=2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Back-God-Problem-Academy/dp/0199841144/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340675842&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Journey+Back+to+God |last=Scott |first=Mark |title=Journey Back to God: Origen on the Problem of Evil |place=Oxford |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick W. Norris, in his article {{Citation | contribution = Apokatastasis | title = The Westminster Handbook to Origen | year = 2004}}, states that the positions that Origen takes on the issue of universal salvation have often seemed to be contradictory. "In scattered places Origen says quite clearly that he thinks all created intelligence will be restored to God at the end of time. In other places he says, equally clearly, that only souls who make the choice for God and practice the virtues God demands will come to rest in heaven.  Those who do not live for God shall suffer eternally in hell or perhaps be annihilated there. If in coming years Origen's treatise on the resurrection is rediscovered, this apparent contradiction may be settled."  He concludes: "One could not know in advance which audience would be most likely to accept the gospel, because of the hope engendered by God's overpowering love or because of the fear stimulated by God's threat of hell coupled with God's demand for ethical living. Most audiences of hearers or readers include both groups; knowing this, Origen the pastoral preacher probably kept his view of salvation economically 'open' for a greater effectiveness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=riEdrWEDFq0C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=Westminster+handbook+origen+apokatastasis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ft95Tdr8JcqnhAe3ypjhBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | editor-first = John Anthony | editor-last = McGuckin | title = The Westminster Handbook to Origen | place = Westminster | publisher = John Knox Press | year = 2004 | ISBN = 978-0-664-22472-1 | type = article | contribution = Apokatastasis | pages = 59–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Elisabeth Dively | last = Lauro | type = article | contribution = [[Universalism]] | editor-first = John Anthony | editor-last = McGuckin | title = The Westminster Handbook to Origen | place = Westminster | publisher = John Knox Press | year = 2004 | ISBN = 978-0-664-22472-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Bruce | last = Demarest | contribution = On apokatastasis | title = [[The Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]] | page = 67 | publisher = TP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Konstantinovsky (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Konstantinovsky | title = Evagrius Ponticus: the making of a gnostic | year = 2009 | page = 171}}.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the uses of ''apocatastasis'' in Christian writings prior to the [[Synod of Constantinople (543)]] and the [[anathema]]s (553) pronounced against "[[Origenist]]s" and [[Evagrius Ponticus]] were neutral and referred primarily to concepts similar to the general "restoration of all things spoken" (''restitutio omnium quae locutus est Deus'') of Peter in Acts 3:21 and not for example the [[universal reconciliation]] of all souls which had ever been.

The term ''apocatastasis'' is mentioned in the 14th of the 15 anathemas against Origen of 553: "If anyone shall say ... that in this pretended apocatastasis, spirits only will continue to exist, as it was in the feigned pre-existence: let him be anathema."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Schaff|editor1-first=Philip|editor2-last=Wace|editor2-first=Henry|editor3-last=Percival|editor3-first=Henry R.|editor1-link=Philip Schaff|editor2-link=Henry Wace (priest)|title=Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Second Series, Vol. XIV: The Seven Ecumenical Councils|publisher=Wm.

A form of ''apocatastasis'' was also attributed to [[Gregory of Nyssa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Morwenna | last = Ludlow |chapter=Patristic Eschatology |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=U32mir3alW8C&amp;pg=PA30 | title = Universal salvation: eschatology in the thought of Gregory of Nyssa and Karl Rahner | publisher = Oxford University Press | location= Oxford |year= 2000 |pages= 30–7 | isbn= 978-0-19-827022-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the [[Ambrosiaster]], attributed to [[Ambrose of Milan]]. [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] discussed it without reaching a decision.

A local [[Synod of Constantinople (543)]] condemned a form of apocatastasis as being [[Anathema]], and the Anathema was formally submitted to the [[Second Council of Constantinople|Fifth Ecumenical Council of Constantinople]] (553). Since ''apocatastasis'' had been used earlier in writers commenting on Peter's use in the New Testament, the form of ''apocatastasis'' condemned in 543 and 553 was a later development.{{Citation needed |date=December 2012}}

[[Origen of Alexandria]]'s other teachings about the possibility of glorified man falling again also played a role in that condemnation.&lt;ref name="origen"/&gt; In fact, most historians today would recognize a distinction between Origen's own teachings (or at least those that have survived) and the theological positions of later "Origenists". Even beliefs long attributed to Origen himself, such as a Platonic version of souls existing before bodies, the possibility of a second fall, are found to be much more nuanced and difficult to pin down in Origen's own writings. The Anathema against apocatastasis, or more accurately, against the belief that hell is not eternal, was not ratified despite support from the Emperor, and it is absent from the Anathemas spoken against Origen at Constantinople II.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The [[Alexandrian school]] adapted Platonic terminology and ideas to Christianity while explaining and differentiating the new faith from all the others.&lt;ref name="origen"&gt;{{Citation | publisher = New advent | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11306b.htm | title = Catholic Encyclopedia | contribution = Origin of Alexandria | accessdate = September 22, 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = New advent | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04045a.htm | title = Catholic Encyclopedia | contribution = Clement of Alexandria | accessdate = September 22, 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents cited [[Bible|Biblical]] passage in {{Citation | url = http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor.%2015:28;&amp;version=31; | title = 1 Corinthians 15:28 | quote = When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.}} in support.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Gnosticism===
The [[gnostic]] [[Gospel of Philip]] ''180–350c'' contains the term itself but does not teach universal reconciliation:
{{quote |There is a rebirth and an image of rebirth. It is certainly necessary to be born again through the image. Which one? Resurrection. The image must rise again through the image. The bridal chamber and the image must enter through the image into the truth: this is the restoration (apokatastasis).  Not only must those who produce the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, do so, but have produced them for you. If one does not acquire them, the name ("Christian") will also be taken from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/gop.html | title = Gospel of Philip | publisher = Gnosis}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Meaning of apocatastasis in Christian theology==

===Early Christianity===
[[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. 150 – c. 215) generally uses the term ''apokatastasis'' to refer to the "restoration" of the "gnostic" Christians, rather than that of the universe or of all Christians, but with universal implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Andrew C | last = Itter | title = Esoteric teaching in the Stromateis of Clement of Alexandria | year = 2009 | page = 200 | quote = Clement uses the term ''apokatastasis'' and its cognates generally to refer to the gnostic elect rather than to an eschatological restoration of the universe, or to a restoration of the faithful as a whole. Where he does mention or imply a restoration of the whole it is through the medium of the restoration of the gnostic.  …Hence, while some uses of ''apokatastasis'' appear to refer simply to the gnostic elect, by extension, they have universal implications.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As indicated above, the position of [[Origen]] (186–284) is disputed, with works as recent as the New Westminster Dictionary of Church History presenting him as speculating that the apocatastasis would involve universal salvation.{{Sfn | Benedetto | Duke | 2008 | p = 37 | ps =: "Origen (186–284) theorized the ''apokatastasis'' as a recovery of the prehistoric ''stasis'', or rest, enjoyed by spiritual creatures before their fall and embodiment.  …Gregory of Nyssa (335–95) shared Origen's hope of all creatures being saved but argued that the final restoration would be a return not to a prehistorical unity but to that ultimate perfection that God originally projected for humanity."}}

In early Christian theological usage ''apocatastasis'' meant the ultimate restoration of all things to their original state, which early exponents believed would still entail a purgatorial state,{{Sfn | Benedetto | Duke | 2008 | p = 37b | ps =: ‘Though often equated with universalism (the salvation of all beings), early exponents couched the ''apokatastasis'' in God's eschatological victory over evil, which would still entail a purgatorial state.’}}  Both [[Origen]] and [[Gregory of Nyssa]] hoped that all creatures would be saved.{{Sfn | Benedetto | Duke | 2008 | p = 37c | ps =: "Origen (186–284) theorized the ''apokatastasis'' as a recovery of the prehistoric ''stasis'', or rest, enjoyed by spiritual creatures before their fall and embodiment.  …Gregory of Nyssa (335–95) shared Origen's hope of all creatures being saved but argued that the final restoration would be a return not to a prehistorical unity but to that ultimate perfection that God originally projected for humanity."}}  The word was still very flexible at that time, but in the mid-6th century it became virtually a technical term referring, as usually today, to a specifically Origenistic doctrine of universal salvation.&lt;ref name =ML&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D_U1887kuFgC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=apocatastasis+universalism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jxB1TdCuEsKqhAfjutxK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBzgo#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | first = Morwenna | last = Ludlow | title = Universal Salvation: Eschatology in the Thought of Gregory of Nyssa and Karl Rahner | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2001 | ISBN = 978-0-19-827022-5 | page = 38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maximus the Confessor]] outlined God's plan for "universal" salvation alongside warnings of everlasting punishment for the wicked.{{Sfn | Benedetto | Duke | 2008 | p = 37d | ps =: "To the extent that Gregory of Nyssa heavily modified the notion of apokatastasis, while Maximus the Confessor (580–662) later outlined the divine plan for universal salvation alongside warnings of everlasting punishment for the wicked".}}

===Luther===
The Vulgate translation of ''apokatastasis'', "in tempora restitutionis omnium quae locutus est Deus" (the restitution of all things of which God has spoken) was taken up by Luther to mean the day of the restitution of the creation, but in Luther's theology the day of restitution was also the day of resurrection and judgment, not the restitution of the wicked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Luther | first = Martin | title = Exegetica opera latina | publisher = Elsperger | year = 1861 | page = 432 | quote = Si autem Pater est futurus perpetuo, ergo semper manet pater, semper generat filios usque ad diem illum restitutionis omnium… | language = Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Luther's Bible he rendered the Greek ''apokatastasis'' with the German ''herwiedergebracht werde''; "will be brought back."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = welcher mus den Himel einnemen bis auff die zeit da er wider bracht werde alles was Gott geredt hat durch den mund aller seiner heiligen Propheten von der Welt an | first = Martin | url = http://lutherbibel.net/ | last = Luther | year = 1545 | publisher = Lutherbibel | title = Die gantze Heilige Schrifft: Deudsch}} modernized as: "welcher muss den Himmel einnehmen bis auf die Zeit, da herwiedergebracht werde alles, was Gott geredet hat durch den Mund aller seiner heiligen Propheten von der Welt an".&lt;/ref&gt; This sense continued to be used in Lutheran sermons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Wilhelm | last = Beste | title = Die bedeutendsten Kanzelredner | year = 1886 | quote = Der Herr Matthesius hat drei Stunden vor seinem seligen Abschiede eine ganze Predigt von diesem Wort gethan. Gottlob, der jüngste Tag ist dies restitutionis omnium. Da wird uns der Herr Jesus Alles wieder an die Seite setzen,…}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther explicitly disowned belief that the devils would ultimately reach blessedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = Denn ichs (=ich es) nicht halte mit denen, so da lehren, daß die Teufel auch werden endlich zur Seligkeit kommen | contribution = Vom Abendmahl Christi Bekenntnis | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NQIRAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA372&amp;dq=%22Denn+ichs+nicht+halte+mit+denen,+so+da+lehren,+da%C3%9F+die+Teufel+auch+werden+endlich+zur+Seligkeit+kommen%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6f55Tcy-JIPJhAfY26z1Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Denn%20ichs%20nicht%20halte%20mit%20denen%2C%20so%20da%20lehren%2C%20da%C3%9F%20die%20Teufel%20auch%20werden%20endlich%20zur%20Seligkeit%20kommen%22&amp;f=false | first = Dr. Martin | last = Luther | title = Sämmtliche Werke | volume = 30 | page = 372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Mark | last = Ellingsen | quote = [Luther in a letter to Rechenberg] held out the hope of universal salvation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SodSn6hgHnIC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=luther+%22universal+salvation%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ShB6TefYBZGwhAfSuOD-Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=luther%20%22universal%20salvation%22&amp;f=false | title = Reclaiming Our Roots | publisher = Continuum International | year = 2000 | ISBN = 978-1-56338-292-5 | page = 58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th-century Universalism===
During the 19th and early 20th centuries several histories published by [[Universalist]]s, including [[Hosea Ballou]] (1829), [[Thomas Whittemore (Universalist)|Thomas Whittemore]] (1830), [[John Wesley Hanson]] (1899) and [[George T. Knight (Universalist)|George T. Knight]] (1911), argued that belief in universal reconciliation was found in [[early Christianity]] and in the [[Reformation]], and ascribed Universalist beliefs to Origen, Clement of Alexandria, and others.

* [[Morwenna Ludlow]] (2001), in {{Citation | title = Universal Salvation: Eschatology in the Thought of Gregory of Nyssa and Karl Rahner}}, writes that, though the meaning was very flexible until the mid-6th century, "the word ''apokatastasis'' is now usually used to refer to a specifically Origenistic doctrine of universal salvation".&lt;ref name=ML /&gt;
* Peter L. Berger, in his book {{Citation | title = Questions of Faith | year = 2003}}, calls apocatastasis "the conviction that, in the end, all will be saved and the entire creation will be reconciled with God".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mcvaNLPo4HYC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=Luther+apocatastasis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tdB5TdXBG4mDhQeAhbTtBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | first = Peter L | last = Berger | title = Questions of Faith | publisher = Wiley, John &amp; Sons | year = 2003 | ISBN = 978-1-4051-0848-5 | page = 154}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ayala Zacks-Abramov''' ({{lang-he|אילה זקס-אברמוב}}, 
1912 &amp;ndash; 30 August 2011) was an [[Israel]]i-[[Canadians|Canadian]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.artlyst.com/articles/canadas-peggy-guggenheim-ayala-zacksabramov-dies Canada's Peggy Guggenheim Ayala Zacks-Abramov Dies - ArtLyst]&lt;/ref&gt; [[art collector]]. Ayala was widowed three times, and was previously married to the Canadian art collector Samuel Jacob Zacks and to the knesset member [[Zalman Abramov]].

==Biography==
Zacks-Abramov was born in Jerusalem in 1912 as Ayala Ben-Tovim. Her parents, Shmuel Ben-Tovim and Rashe (née: Berman) were married in Jerusalem in 1902. She studied in London and in Paris where she met her first husband, Morris Fleg, whom she married in 1938.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 1940, during [[World War II]], he joined the [[French Resistance]] after Fleg enlisted to the army and was killed during a military operation.

In 1947, she married Samuel Zacks, a Canadian economist and art collector, whom she met during her stay in [[Switzerland]]. After marrying, the couple began to collect art items from the 19th century and the 20th century, mainly of French, Canadian and Israeli artists such as [[Gauguin]], [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], [[Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] and [[Chagall]]. They also acquired art by Israeli artists such as [[Marcel Janco]], [[Mordechai Ardon]], [[Reuven Rubin]] and [[Anna Ticho]], and art of relatively unknown artists at the time of the purchase such as [[Ofer Lellouche]], [[Yigal Tumarkin]] and [[Joseph Zaritsky]].

In 1970, her husband Zacks died. She returned to Israel in 1976 and married Zalman Abramov, who was a lawyer and a Knesset member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/1.1373523 מתה פטרונית האמנות אילה זקס אברמוב - גלריה - הארץ]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were [[Patronage|patrons of the arts]], and Abramov continued to support the art world even after her husband's death in 1997.

Zachs-Abramov supported over the years the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]] and the [[Israel Museum]] and had a hand in their growth. Both the museums have halls named after her. She mentioned these museums in her will, in which she declared that her art collection would be divided between them.

The Israeli notable painter [[Joseph Zaritsky]] painted a well-known figurative portrait of her.

Many of the art works in Zachs-Abramov's possession were donated or loaned through to years to museums in Israel, France and Canada.

'''Biruda''' is a mixture of five seeds of crops used for worshipping and blessing during the [[Gaura Festival]]. These five seed mixture is made up of [[gaut, grussa,gahu,maas and kerau]]. This festival is mainly celebrated in Far-western region of Nepal and this mixture Biruda is mainly eaten in this region.In Gaura festival it is believed that god Mahesh (Shiv) got married with goddess Gaura (Parwati).

{{hindu-stub}}
In the day of biruda panchami this mixture is kept with water in a copper (generally) pot to make them wet. Next day the mixture is washed and water is replaced with full customs and worship of Goddess Gaura. Next day this process recontinues. Finally, forth day from panchmi called astami, all women who wore a sacred thread [[dubi dhaka]] fast for good fortune of them and their family members. Whole day women worship goddess Gaura chanting different mantras and folk songs. At last near to end every one gets up, biruda and fruits are kept into cloths and the cloth is pushed towards sky every one start to catch any thing they can, it is believed that it is good for fortune to catch these things.</text>

==Plant physiology==
{{main|Cannabis|Cannabis cultivation}} &lt;!--- needs resynch ---&gt;
The flowers of ''Cannabis sativa'' are unisexual and plants are most often either male or female.&lt;ref name="SHARMA2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=SHARMA|title=PLANT TAXONOMY 2E|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Roi0lwSXFnUC&amp;pg=PA459|year=2011|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-1-259-08137-8|pages=459–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a short-day flowering plant, with staminate (male) plants usually taller and less robust than pistillate (female or male) plants&lt;ref&gt;.http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=200006342&lt;/ref&gt; The [[flower]]s of the female plant are arranged in [[raceme]]s and can produce hundreds of seeds. Male plants shed their pollen and die several weeks prior to seed ripening on the female plants. Under typical conditions with a light period of 12 to 14 hours both sexes are produced in equal numbers because of heritable [[XY sex-determination system|X and Y chromosomes]].&lt;ref name="ClarkeMerlin2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Clarke|author2=Mark Merlin|title=Cannabis: Evolution and Ethnobotany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=poenY6QMq8UC&amp;pg=PA16|date=1 September 2013|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-95457-1|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although genetic factors dispose a plant to become male or female, environmental factors including the [[Diurnal cycle|diurnal light cycle]] can alter sexual expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schaffner|first=John H.|date=1921-01-01|title=Influence of Environment on Sexual Expression in Hemp|journal=Botanical Gazette|volume=71|issue=3|pages=197–219|doi=10.1086/332818|jstor=2469863}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Naturally occurring [[monoecious]] plants, with both male and female parts, are either sterile or fertile but artificially induced "[[hermaphrodites]]" can have fully functional reproductive organs. "Feminized" seed sold by many commercial seed suppliers are derived from artificially "hermaphrodytic" females that lack the male gene, or by treating the plants with hormones or silver [[thiosulfate]].

==Pharmacology==
{{main|Cannabis (drug)}}
[[File:Tetrahydrocannabinol.svg|thumb|left|200px|Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-[[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC)]]
[[File:Cannabis sativa Koehler drawing.jpg|thumb|right|''Cannabis sativa'', scientific drawing from ''c''1900]]

Although the main [[psychoactive]] constituent of ''Cannabis'' is [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC), the plant is known to contain more than 500 compounds, among them at least 113 [[cannabinoid]]s; however, most of these "minor" cannabinoids are only produced in trace amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aizpurua-Olaizola|first=Oier|last2=Soydaner|first2=Umut|last3=Öztürk|first3=Ekin|last4=Schibano|first4=Daniele|last5=Simsir|first5=Yilmaz|last6=Navarro|first6=Patricia|last7=Etxebarria|first7=Nestor|last8=Usobiaga|first8=Aresatz|date=2016-02-02|title=Evolution of the Cannabinoid and Terpene Content during the Growth ofCannabis sativaPlants from Different Chemotypes|journal=Journal of Natural Products|language=EN|volume=79|issue=2|pages=324–331|doi=10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b00949|pmid=26836472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides THC, another cannabinoid produced in high concentrations by some plants is [[cannabidiol]] (CBD), which is not psychoactive but has recently been shown to block the effect of THC in the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russo|first=Ethan B|date=2011-08-01|title=Taming THC: potential cannabis synergy and phytocannabinoid-terpenoid entourage effects|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|language=en|volume=163|issue=7|pages=1344–1364|doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01238.x|issn=1476-5381|pmc=3165946|pmid=21749363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in the chemical composition of ''Cannabis'' varieties may produce different effects in humans. Synthetic THC, called [[dronabinol]], does not contain cannabidiol (CBD), [[cannabinol]] (CBN), or other cannabinoids, which is one reason why its [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] effects may differ significantly from those of natural ''Cannabis'' preparations.

==Chemical constituents==
''Beside cannabinoids, Cannabis'' chemical constituents include about 120 compounds responsible for its [[Cannabis flower essential oil|characteristic aroma]]. These are mainly volatile [[terpene]]s and [[sesquiterpene]]s.

===Difference between ''C. sativa'' and ''C. indica''===
Human intervention has produced variation within the species and some authorities only recognize one species in the genus that has had divergent selective pressure to either produce plants with more fiber or plants with greater THC content.&lt;ref name="ChandraLata2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Suman Chandra|author2=Hemant Lata|author3=Mahmoud A.

==Common uses==
{{main|Cannabis#Industrial and personal uses|l1=Industrial and personal uses of ''Cannabis''|Cannabis (drug)|Hemp}}

''Cannabis sativa'' seeds are chiefly used to make hempseed oil which can be used for cooking, lamps, lacquers or paints. They can also be used as caged-bird feed, as they provide a moderate source of nutrients for most birds. The flowers (and to a lesser extent the leaves, stems, and seeds) contain [[psychoactive]] [[chemical compound]]s known as [[cannabinoids]] that are consumed for recreational, medicinal and spiritual purposes. When so used, preparations of flowers ([[marijuana]]) and leaves and preparations derived from resinous extract (e.g., [[hashish]]) are consumed by smoking, vaporising and oral ingestion. Historically, [[tincture]]s, [[Herbal tea|teas]] and [[ointment]]s have also been common preparations. In [[traditional medicine]] of India in particular ''C. sativa'' has been used as hallucinogenic, hypnotic, [[sedative]], [[analgesic]] and [[anti-inflammatory]] agent.&lt;ref&gt;Bonini, Sara Anna. “Cannabis Sativa: A Comprehensive Ethnopharmacological Review of a Medicinal Plant with a Long History.” Shibboleth Authentication Request, ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD, Dec. 2017, apps.webofknowledge.com.proxy.cc.uic.edu/full_record.do?product=WOS&amp;search_mode=GeneralSearch&amp;qid=7&amp;SID=5DN8tlmEqPYfoMJMbXL&amp;page=1&amp;doc=1.&lt;/ref&gt; Cannabis sativa has been used in medical practices as a therapeutic alternative for people with mental illnesses to lift off stress which leads recreational users to believe that sativa can aid them with their stress heavy lives. However, recent ethnopharmacology studies have shown that sativa can actually cause sleep disorders and heighten neurological and psychiatric illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = L | last2 = Waltenberger | first2 = B | last3 = Pferschy-Wenzig | first3 = EM | last4 = Blunder | first4 = M | last5 = Liu | first5 = X | last6 = Malainer | first6 = C | last7 = Blazevic | first7 = T | last8 = Schwaiger | first8 = S | last9 = Rollinger | first9 = JM | last10 = Heiss | first10 = EH | last11 = Schuster | first11 = D | last12 = Kopp | first12 = B | last13 = Bauer | first13 = R | last14 = Stuppner | first14 = H | last15 = Dirsch | first15 = VM | last16 = Atanasov | first16 = AG | year = 2014 | title = Natural product agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ): a review | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295214004249# | journal = Biochem Pharmacol | volume = 92| issue = 1| pages = 73–89| doi = 10.1016/j.bcp.2014.07.018 | pmid = 25083916 | pmc=4212005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2002-01-01|title=Characteristics of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) seed oil|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030881460100245X|journal=Food Chemistry|language=en|volume=76|issue=1|pages=33–43|doi=10.1016/S0308-8146(01)00245-X|issn=0308-8146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
A ''Cannabis'' plant in the vegetative growth phase of its life requires more than 12–13 hours of light per day to stay vegetative. Flowering usually occurs when darkness equals at least 12 hours per day{{Dubious|date=June 2015}}. The flowering cycle can last anywhere between nine and fifteen weeks, depending on the strain and environmental conditions.

In soil, the optimum [[pH]] for the plant is 6.3 to 6.8. In [[hydroponics|hydroponic]] growing, the nutrient solution is best at 5.2 to 5.8, making ''Cannabis'' well-suited to hydroponics because this pH range is hostile to most bacteria and fungi.

[[Tissue culture]] multiplication has become important in producing medically important clones,&lt;ref name="Arora2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rajesh Arora|title=Medicinal Plant Biotechnology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3sPwKo3b3cUC&amp;pg=PA103|year=2010|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-692-1|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt; while seed production remains the generally preferred means of multiplication.&lt;ref name="ChandraLata2017"/&gt;

==Cultivars==
Broadly, there are three main [[cultivar|cultivar groups]] of cannabis that are cultivated today:
* Cultivars primarily cultivated for their fibre, characterised by long stems and little branching.
* Cultivars grown for seed which can be eaten entirely raw or from which [[hemp oil]] is extracted.
* Cultivars grown for medicinal or [[recreational drug use|recreational]] purposes. A nominal if not legal distinction is often made between industrial hemp, with concentrations of psychoactive compounds far too low to be useful for that purpose, and [[marijuana]].

'''Blessed''' '''Catherine of Racconigi, [[Third Order of St. Dominic|T.O.S.D.]]''', (1486 &amp;ndash; 1574, [[Racconigi]]) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] member of the [[Third Order of St. Dominic]], who is recognized for being a [[mysticism|mystic]] and a [[stigmatic]].

==Biography==
{{Christian mysticism}}
Most of the information regarding Catherine Mattei is derived from a ''vita'' written by her friend, John Francis Pico, Prince of Mirandola.&lt;ref name=rfo&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m67PAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=Catherine+of+Racconigi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sPxD9LjD4z&amp;sig=LWwYi0JmdU3-GZnYXC8Bq4O6hj8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vl2WVO6cB4O-ggSfm4SYAg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwCjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Catherine%20of%20Racconigi&amp;f=false O'Connor, R.F., "Blessed Catherine of Racconigi", ''The American Catholic Quarterly Review'', (James Andrew Corcoran, Patrick John Ryan, Edmond Francis Prendergast eds.), Volume 41, p.211, Hardy and Mahony, Philadelphia, 1916]&lt;/ref&gt;
Catherine Mattei ({{lang-it|Caterina Mattei}}) was born in the [[Piedmont]] region of [[Northwest Italy]] in 1487 into an impoverished household in the [[Province of Cuneo]]. Intermittent conflicts in the area brought widespread poverty. Her parents were Giorgio and Bilia de Ferrari Mattei. Her father was an unemployed tool-maker, while her mother was a [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]] who was able to support the family. Her father was often despondent&lt;ref name=opwest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opwest.org/index.php/2011/09/Blessed-Catherine-Mattei|title=Full Article - Western Dominican Province|work=opwest.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221084322/http://www.opwest.org/index.php/2011/09/Blessed-Catherine-Mattei|archivedate=2014-12-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quarrelsome, thus the family environment was usually one of conflict.

She is said to have had, at about the age of nine, a vision of Jesus, who appeared to her as a boy of about ten. She would also begin to have visions of other saints such as the [[Dominican order|Dominican]]s  [[Catherine of Siena]] and [[Peter of Verona|Peter Martyr]]. The Virgin told her that Jesus wanted to have her as his Bride, as a token of which she was given a [[wedding ring]], which she had all her life—but which only she could see. She began to have frequent [[religious ecstasy|ecstasies]] and visions of Jesus, who always appeared to her as the same age she was at the time of the vision.

Many miracles would result from her visions: a broken dish was made whole again, and money and food would be provided when the family’s poverty was extreme. In times of trial she received great consolation from the aspiration, "Jesus, is my only hope!"&lt;ref name=opwest/&gt;

Blessed Catherine eventually joined the [[Dominican Order]] herself, but, like St. Catherine, she was opposed in this wish by her family. As a result, instead of entering a monastery of the [[cloister]]ed [[nun]]s of the Order, she became a [[Third Order of St. Dominic|tertiary]] of the Order, continuing to live with her family. As the visions increased she received the [[stigmata]], although, the wounds were not visible until after her death.&lt;ref name=opwest/&gt;

Her mystical experiences roused a storm of gossip among her neighbors, who were terrified at the lights and sounds that came from her home; even the Dominican [[friar]]s began to ostracize her. Eventually she was forced out of the town and settled in the city of Racconigi. During her lifetime, Catherine was sought for counsel and prayer. She would keep in her prayers in a special way the salvation of soldiers who were dying in battle.

==Veneration==
Many miracles took place before and after her death and her detractors came to acknowledge the holiness of her life. Her [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] was approved in 1810 by Pope [[Pius VII]].

The '''Christological argument''' for the [[existence of God]], which exists in several forms, holds that if certain claims about Jesus are valid, one should accept that God exists.{{cn|date=January 2018}} There are three main threads; the argument from the wisdom of Jesus, the argument from the claims of Jesus as son of God and the argument from the resurrection.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Argument from the wisdom of Jesus==
The essential structure of this argument is as follows:{{vn|date=November 2014}}
# The character and wisdom of Jesus is such that his views about reality are (or are likely to be) correct.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
# One of Jesus' views about reality was that God exists.
# Therefore, the view that God exists is (or is likely to be) correct.

Some forms of [[evangelism]] take this approach. Potential [[Religious conversion|converts]] are introduced to Jesus as a historical character and the merits of Jesus' teachings are discussed. In such a context, the [[Historicity of Jesus Christ|historicity of Jesus of Nazareth]] is a crucial factor in assessing the argument.

The principal objections to (1) are the suggestions that:
# The reports of Jesus' character in the Bible are not reliable.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
# Jesus' views about reality are not (or not likely to be) necessarily correct.&lt;ref&gt;This is the principal line in [[The God Delusion]] although there are subsidiary suggestions that Jesus may not have existed.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]], in his essay "[[Why I Am Not a Christian]]", criticized Jesus' personal character and philosophical positions on various grounds.
# Even supposing that Jesus was correct, wise, and knowledgeable about a great many things does not imply that he was knowledgeable about everything. A deep knowledge of moral philosophy and the iniquities of the human condition, for example, do not necessarily imply any valid expertise on astrophysics, Phoenician literature, or the literal existence of God.

==Argument from the claims of Jesus to divinity==
{{See also|Lewis's trilemma}}
Lewis's trilemma is an [[Apologetics|apologetic]] argument traditionally used to argue for the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|divinity of Jesus]] by arguing that the only alternatives were that he was evil or deluded.&lt;ref name=Dock&gt;Lewis, C. S., ''God in the Dock'' (Eerdmans, 2014), pages 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; One version was popularised by [[University of Oxford]] literary scholar and writer [[C. S. Lewis]] in a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] radio talk and in his writings. It is sometimes described as the "Lunatic, Liar, or Lord", or "Mad, Bad, or God" argument. It takes the form of a [[trilemma]] — a choice among three options, each of which is in some way difficult to accept.

This argument is very popular with Christian apologists, although some theologians and biblical scholars&lt;ref name="Davis 2006, page 151"&gt;Davis (2006), page 151&lt;/ref&gt; do not view Jesus as  having claimed to be God.&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John, ''The Metaphor of God Incarnate'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=f-QMmFx8hwcC&amp;pg=PA27 page 27].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lord_jesus_christ_a01"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Hurtado | first1 = Larry W. | title = Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity |url = https://books.google.com/?id=_MH-_ZQuZrgC&amp;pg=PA5 | year = 2005 | publisher = Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company | location =  | isbn = 0-8028-3167-2 | pages = 5  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that he identified himself as a divine agent, with a unique relationship to [[Yahweh|Israel's God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Michael F.|last1=Bird|authorlink=Michael F. Bird|chapter=3: Did Jesus Think He Was God?|editor1-last=Bird|editor1-first=Michael F.|title=How God Became Jesus: The Real Origins of Belief in Jesus' Divine Nature — A Response to Bart D. Ehrman|date=2014|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, MI|page=46|accessdate=23 August 2014|quote=Jesus identified himself as a divine agent with a unique authority and a unique relationship with Israel's God. In addition, he spoke as one who spoke for God in an immediate sense and believed himself to be embodying the very person of God in his mission to renew and restore Israel.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others see him as wanting to direct attention to the divine kingdom he proclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurtado|first=Larry W.|title=How on Earth Did Jesus Become a God?: Historical Questions about Earliest Devotion to Jesus|date=2005|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|location=Grand Rapids, MI|page=3|quote=To judge from the many sayings attributed to Jesus in the New Testament Gospels... [i]n addition to proclaiming and teaching about God's kingdom, Jesus also seems to have engaged in other activities that had the effect of drawing further attention to him but were primarily intended to demonstrate something of the power and the purposes of the divine kingdom that he announced.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument relies on the premise that Jesus was a great moral teacher. The structure of the argument is as follows:{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
# Jesus claimed to be God
# Jesus was a wise moral teacher
# By the trilemma, Jesus was dishonest, deluded or God
# No wise moral teacher is dishonest
# No wise moral teacher is deluded
# By 2 and 4, Jesus was not dishonest
# By 2 and 5, Jesus was not deluded
# By 3, 6 and 7, Jesus was God
# By 8, God exists

Those who dispute these premises suggest that:
# Disputing premise 1: Jesus was indeed a wise moral teacher, but his reported teachings have been distorted or misrepresented. For instance, he may not have actually claimed to be divine; this claim may have been added by later writers. Many modern New Testament scholars argue that Jesus did not, in fact, claim to be God.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hick]], ''The Metaphor of God Incarnate: Christology in a Pluralistic Age'', Westminster John Knox Press, page 27.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Disputing premise 2: [[C.S. Lewis]] expressed the opinion that any mere man who claimed to be God could not, by definition, be a wise moral teacher (and that, conversely, any wise moral teacher would not claim to be God).&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Lewis, ''Mere Christianity''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Hitchens]] argued that Jesus was not a wise moral teacher by arguing against several of his teachings. For example, of Jesus' teaching "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone", Hitchens wrote: "if only the non-sinners have the right to punish, then how could an imperfect society ever determine how to prosecute offenders?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hitchens]], [[God Is Not Great]], Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Disputing premise 4: A person can be a wise moral teacher despite lying. Jesus could have believed (as some later philosophers have held) that religion is false but beneficial to society, and that by establishing a new religion (or a reform of Judaism) he was doing a good deed nonetheless.
# Disputing premise 5: A person can be a wise moral teacher despite being delusional. Granting credence to some, or even most, of someone's claims does not require that we give credence to all of them. Someone can believe Socrates' philosophical claims about justice without also believing Socrates' theological speculations about the Greek gods, or accept Aristotle's views on poetry without also accepting his claim that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones.

Philosopher John Beversluis described Lewis's arguments as "textually careless and theologically unreliable",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=John |last=Beversluis |title=C. S. Lewis and the Search for Rational Religion |publisher=[[W. B. Eerdmans]] |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |year=1985 |isbn=0-8028-0046-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this particular argument as logically unsound and an example of [[false dilemma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=John |last=Beversluis |title=C. S. Lewis and the Search for Rational Religion |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |location=Buffalo, New York |year=2007 |page=132 |origyear=1985 |isbn=1-59102-531-1 |oclc=85899079}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament scholar [[N. T. Wright]] criticises Lewis for failing to recognise the significance of Jesus' Jewish identity and setting&amp;nbsp;– an oversight which "at best, drastically short-circuits the argument" and which lays Lewis open to criticism that his argument "doesn't work as history, and it backfires dangerously when historical critics question his reading of the gospels", although he believes this "doesn't undermine the eventual claim".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |first=N. T. |last=Wright |authorlink=N. T. Wright |date=March 2007 |title=Simply Lewis: Reflections on a Master Apologist After 60 Years |url=http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=20-02-028-f |magazine=[[Touchstone (magazine)|Touchstone]] |volume=20 |issue=2 |access-date=11 February 2009 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument from the resurrection==
{{see also|Arguments for the existence of God|Christology}}
Another argument is that the [[resurrection of Jesus]] occurred and was an act of God, hence God must exist.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Some version of this argument have been presented, such as [[N. T. Wright]]'s argument from the nature of the claim of resurrection to its occurrence and the "minimal facts argument", defended by scholars such as [[Gary Habermas]] and [[Mike Licona]], which defend that God raising Jesus from the dead is "the best explanation for a set of claimed historical facts about Jesus and his disciples".{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[William Lane Craig]], another advocate of this last argument, includes in the list of facts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/jesus-of-nazareth/the-resurrection-of-jesus/|title=See "The Resurrection of Jesus" by William Lane Craig at ReasonableFaith.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# After his crucifixion, Jesus was buried in a tomb by [[Joseph of Arimathea]]
# On the Sunday following the crucifixion, Jesus’ tomb was found empty by a group of his women followers 
# On multiple occasions and under various circumstances, different individuals and groups of people experienced appearances of Jesus alive from the dead 
# The original disciples believed that Jesus was risen from the dead despite their having every predisposition to the contrary.

In light of these, he goes on to say the best explanation is that God raised Jesus from the dead.

Such arguments have had many responses which depends on the version in question. The "minimal facts argument", for instance, have been criticized both regarding the actual veracity of the claimed historical facts as well as the inference to the best explanation being that God rose Jesus from the dead. In the second case, people such as [[Gerd Lüdemmann]] justify their rejection based on philosophical reasons while others, such as [[Bart D. Ehrman]], do by more methodological reasons. Regarding the claimed facts, Ehrman and others defend that the sources used in their defense (normally the Gospels) are not trustworthy and so the facts can't be credibly established, while others have provided positive reasons to attest them as false.

This is the major position in Islam, which rejects that Jesus ever was crucified. Islamic texts categorically deny the crucifixion and death of Jesus at the hands of the Jews.&lt;ref name="EoI-Isa"&gt;"Isa", Encyclopedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an states that the Jews sought to kill Jesus, but they did not kill or crucify him, although a likeness of it was shown to them. Traditionalists believe that Jesus was not crucified but instead was raised [[entering Heaven alive|alive into heaven]]. This raising is understood by them to mean bodily ascension, while some Qur'anic scholars, such as [[Muhammad Asad]], while cross referencing the text consider it to mean being raised in honour:&lt;ref name="EoQ-cross"&gt;Neal Robinson, Crucifixion, Encyclopedia of the Qur'an&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|{{Quran-usc-range|4|157|e=158|q=That they said (in boast), "We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of God";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:- Nay, God raised him up unto the himself; and God is Exalted in Power, Wise.}}}}

According to some Muslim traditions, Jesus was replaced by a double; others suggest it was [[Simon of Cyrene]], or one of the disciples such as [[Judas Iscariot]]. Some others view it as Jesus surviving the crucifixion. A minority of commentaries of [[Ismaili]] or rationalist (''falāsifa'') leaning affirmed the crucifixion by arguing that Jesus' body had been crucified, but his spirit had ascended. However, this interpretation was generally rejected, and according to the ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', there was unanimous agreement among the scholars in denying the crucifixion,&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Islam further elaborates: "The denial, furthermore, is in perfect agreement with the logic of the Qur’an. The Biblical Prophets alluded to in it (e.g., Job, Moses, Joseph etc.) and the episodes relating to the history of the beginning of Islam demonstrate that it is “God's practice” ([[sunnat Allah]] ) to make faith triumph finally over the forces of evil and adversity. “So truly with hardship comes ease”, (XCIV, 5, 6). For Jesus to die on the cross would have meant the triumph of his executioners; but the Quran asserts that they undoubtedly failed: “Assuredly God will defend those who believe”; (XXII, 49). He confounds the plots of the enemies of Christ (III, 54)." (cf. `Isa, ''Encyclopedia of Islam'')&lt;/ref&gt; despite famous Muslim apologist [[Shabir Ally]] have demonstrated that it is possible that Jesus was not crucified at all.&lt;ref&gt;See Shabir's debate with William Lane Craig, where he demonstrated to be open to the possibility of a real crucifixion without death.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern commentators such as M. Hayek interpret the verse to say that the crucifixion "seemed thus to them" [i.e. the Jews].&lt;ref name="EoI-Isa"/&gt;

[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], the main rabbinical seminary of Conservative Judaism]]

'''Conservative Judaism''' (known as '''Masorti Judaism''' outside [[North America]]) is a major [[Jewish denomination]] which views Jewish law, or ''[[Halakha]]'', as both binding and subject to historical development. The Conservative rabbinate therefore employs modern [[Historical criticism|historical-critical]] research, rather than only traditional methods and sources, and lends great weight to its constituency when determining its stance on matters of law. The movement considers its approach as the authentic and most appropriate continuation of ''halakhic'' discourse, maintaining both fealty to received forms and flexibility in their interpretation. It also eschews strict theological definitions, lacking a consensus in matters of faith and allowing great pluralism.

While regarding itself as the heir of Rabbi [[Zecharias Frankel]]'s 19th-century Positive-Historical School in Europe, Conservative Judaism fully institutionalized as a denomination only in the United States during the mid-20th century. Its largest center today is in North America, where its main congregational arm is the [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]] and the New York–based [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] operates as rabbinic seminary. Worldwide, affiliated communities are united within the umbrella organization [[Masorti Olami]]. Conservative Judaism is estimated to represent close to 1.1 million people, both more than 600,000 registered adult congregants and many non-member identifiers.

The term ''conservative'' was meant to signify that Jews should attempt to conserve Jewish tradition, rather than reform or abandon it, and does not imply the movement's adherents are [[Conservatism|politically conservative]].

==Theology==
===Attitude===
Conservative Judaism, from its earliest stages, was marked by ambivalence and ambiguity in all matters theological. Rabbi [[Zecharias Frankel]], considered its intellectual progenitor, believed the very notion of theology was alien to traditional Judaism. He was often accused of obscurity on the subject by his opponents, both Reform and Orthodox. The American movement largely espoused a similar approach, and its leaders mostly avoided the field. Only in 1985 did a course about Conservative theology open in the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] (JTS). The hitherto sole major attempt to define a clear credo was made in 1988, with the Statement of Principles ''Emet ve-Emunah'' (Truth and Belief), formulated and issued by the [[Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism]]. The introduction stated that "lack of definition was useful" in the past but a need to articulate one now arose. The platform provided many statements citing key concepts such as God, revelation and [[Election of Israel|Election]], but also acknowledged that a variety of positions and convictions existed within denominational ranks, eschewing strict delineation of principles and often expressing conflicting views.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Gordis]], ''Conservative Judaism: The Struggle between Ideology and Popularity'', in: Jacob Neusner ed., ''The Blackwell Companion to Judaism'', [[Blackwell Publishing]], 2003. pp. 338-342.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AS"&gt;[[Alan Silverstein]], ''Modernists vs. Traditionalists: Competition for Legitimacy within American Conservative Judaism'', in: ''Studies in Contemporary Jewry, Volume XVII'', Oxford University Press, 2001. pp. 40-43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel J. Elazar]], Rela Mintz Geffen, ''The Conservative Movement in Judaism: Dilemmas and Opportunities'', SUNY Press, 2012. pp. 55-57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ismar Schorsch]], ''Zecharias Frankel and the European Origins of Conservative Judaism,'' Judaism 30 (1981)4. pp. 344–348&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1999 special edition of ''[[Conservative Judaism (journal)|Conservative Judaism]]'' dedicated to the matter, leading rabbis [[Elliot N. Dorff]] and [[Gordon Tucker]] clarified that "the great diversity" within the movement "makes the creation of a theological vision shared by all neither possible nor desirable".&lt;ref&gt;''”If you are My witnesses...”: Special Issue on Theology''. Conservative Judaism 51, no. 2 (Winter 1999). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===God and eschatology===
Conservative Judaism largely upholds the [[theistic]] notion of a [[personal God]]. ''Emet ve-Emunah'' stated that "we affirm our faith in God as the Creator and Governor of the universe. His power called the world into being; His wisdom and goodness guide its destiny."   
Concurrently, the platform also noted that His nature was "elusive" and subject to many options of belief. A [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] conception of divinity, regarding it as inseparable from the mundane world, once had an important place within the denomination, especially represented by [[Mordecai Kaplan]]. After Kaplan's [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionism]] fully coalesced into an independent movement, these views were marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;''”If you are My witnesses...”'', pp. 41, 59.; Gordis, 353-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similarly inconclusive position is expressed toward other precepts. Most theologians adhere to the [[Immortality of the Soul]], but while references to the [[Resurrection of the Dead]] are maintained, English translations of the prayers obscure the issue. In ''Emet'', it was stated that death is not tantamount to the end of one's personality. Relating to the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messianic ideal]], the movement rephrased most petitions for the restoration of the [[Korban|Sacrifices]] into past tense, rejecting a renewal of animal offerings, though not opposing a [[Gathering of Israel|Return to Zion]] and even a [[Third Temple|new Temple]]. The 1988 platform announced that "some" believe in classic eschathology, but dogmatism in this matter was "philosophically unjustified". The notions of [[Election of Israel]] and God's covenant with it were basically retained as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elliot N. Dorff]], ''Conservative Judaism: Our Ancestors To Our Descendants'', United Synagogue New York, 1996. pp. 49 ,201-202; Martha Himmelfarb, ''Resurrection'', in: Adele Berlin (ed.), ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'', Oxford University Press, 2011. p. 624&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revelation===
Conservative conception of [[Revelation]] encompasses an extensive spectrum. Zecharias Frankel himself applied critical-scientific methods to analyze the stages in the development of the [[Oral Torah]], pioneering modern study of the [[Mishnah]]. He regarded the [[Chazal|Beatified Sages]] as innovators who added their own, original contribution to the canon, not merely as expounders and interpreters of a legal system given in its entirety to [[Moses]] on Mount Sinai. Yet he also vehemently rejected utilizing these disciplines on the Pentateuch, maintaining it was beyond human reach and wholly celestial in origin. Frankel never elucidated his beliefs, and the exact correlation between human and divine in his thought is still subject to scholarly debate.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;Michael Meyer, ''Response to Modernity: A History of the Reform Movement in Judaism'', Wayne State, 1995. pp. 84-89, 414.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar negative approach toward [[Higher Criticism]], while accepting an evolutionary understanding of Oral Law, defined Rabbi [[Alexander Kohut]], [[Solomon Schechter]] and the early generation of American Conservative Judaism. When JTS faculty began to embrace Biblical criticism in the 1920s, they adapted a theological view consistent with it: an original, verbal revelation did occur at Sinai, but the text itself was composed by later authors. The latter, classified by Dorff as a relatively moderate metamorphosis of the old one, is still espoused by few traditionalist right-wing Conservative rabbis, though it is marginalized among senior leadership.&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorff, pp. 103-105&lt;/ref&gt;

A small but influential segment within the JTS and the movement adhered, from the 1930s, to Mordecai Kaplan's philosophy that denied any form of revelation but viewed all scripture as a purely human product. Along with other Reconstructionist tenets, it dwindled as the latter consolidated into a separate group. Kaplan's views and the permeation of Higher Criticism gradually swayed most Conservative thinkers towards a non-verbal understanding of theophany, which has become dominant in the 1970s. This was en sync with the wider trend of lowering rates of Americans who accepted the Bible as the Word of God.&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorff, pp. 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorff categorized the proponents of this into two schools. One maintains that God projected some form of message which inspired the human authors of the Pentateuch to record what they perceived. The other is often strongly influenced by  [[Franz Rosenzweig]] and other [[Jewish existentialism|existentialists]], but also attracted many [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivists]] who consider human reason paramount. The second school states that God conferred merely his presence on those he influenced, without any communication, and the experience drove them to spiritual creativity. While they differ in the theoretical level surrounding revelation, both practically regard all scripture and religious tradition as a human product with certain divine inspiration – providing an understanding that recognizes Biblical Criticism and also justifies major innovation in religious conduct. The first doctrine, advocated by such leaders as rabbis [[Ben-Zion Bokser]] and [[Robert Gordis]], largely imparted that some elements within Judaism are fully divine but determining which would be impractical, and therefore received forms of interpretation should be basically upheld. Exponents of the latter view, among them rabbis [[Louis Jacobs]] and [[Neil Gillman]], also emphasized the encounter of God with the Jews as a collective and the role of religious authorities through the generations in determining what it implied. The stress on the supremacy of community and tradition, rather than individual consciousness, defines the entire spectrum of Conservative thought.&lt;ref&gt;Dorff, pp. 107-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|expanded=denominations}}
The Conservative mainstay was the adoption of the historical-critical method in understanding Judaism and setting its future course. In accepting an evolutionary approach to the religion, as something that developed over time and absorbed considerable external influences, the movement distinguished between the original meaning implied in traditional sources and the manner they were grasped by successive generations, rejecting belief in an unbroken chain of interpretation from God's original Revelation, immune to any major extraneous effects. This evolutionary perception of religion, while relatively moderate in comparison with more radical modernizers&amp;nbsp;– the scholarship of the Positive-Historical school, for example, sought to demonstrate the continuity and cohesiveness of Judaism along the years&amp;nbsp;– still challenged Conservative leaders.

They regarded tradition and received mores with reverence, especially the continued adherence to the mechanism of Religious Law (''[[Halakha]]''), opposing indiscriminate modification, and emphasized they should be changed only with care and caution, and remain observed by the people. Rabbi [[Louis Ginzberg]], summarizing his movement's position, wrote:
{{quote|We may now understand the apparent contradiction between the theory and practice... One may conceive of the origin of [[Sabbath]] as the professor at university would, yet observe the smallest detail known to strict Orthodoxy... The sanctity of the Sabbath reposes not upon the fact that it was proclaimed on Sinai, but on the fact that it found for thousands of years its expression in Jewish souls. It is the task of the historian to examine into the beginnings and developments of customs and observances; practical Judaism on the other hand is not concerned with origins, but regards the institutions as they have come to be.}}
This discrepancy between scientific criticism and insistence on heritage had to be compensated by a conviction that would forestall either deviation from accepted norms or laxity and apathy.&lt;ref&gt;Dorff, pp. 20-23; [[David Golinkin]], ''Halakha For Our Time: A Conservative Approach To Jewish Law'', United Synagogue, 1991. pp. 13-17. See also: S.H. Schwartz, [http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/details.cfm?PublicationID=8820 Conservative Judaism's 'Ideology' Problem.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key doctrine which was to fulfill this capacity was the collective will of the Jewish people. Conservatives lent it great weight in determining religious practice, both in historical precedent and as a means to shape present conduct. [[Zecharias Frankel]] pioneered this approach; as Michael A. Meyer commented, "the extraordinary status which he ascribed to the ingrained beliefs and practices of the community is probably the most original element of his thought." He turned it into a source of legitimacy for both change and preservation, but mostly the latter. The basic moderation and traditionalism of the majority among the people were to guarantee a sense of continuity and unity, restraining the guiding rabbis and scholars who at his age were intent on reform, but also allowing them maneuverability in adopting or discarding certain elements.&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt; [[Solomon Schechter]] espoused a similar position. He turned the old rabbinic concept of ''K'lal Yisrael'', which he translated as "Catholic Israel", into a comprehensive worldview. For him, the details of divine Revelation were of secondary significance, as historical change dictated its interpretation through the ages notwithstanding: "the center of authority is actually removed from the Bible", he surmised, "and placed in some living body... in touch with the ideal aspirations and the religious needs of the age, best able to determine... This living body, however, is not represented by... priesthood, or Rabbihood, but by the collective conscience of Catholic Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Gillman]], ''Conservative Judaism: The New Century'', Behrman House, 1993. pp. 54-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope, limits and role of this corpus were a matter for contention in Conservative ranks. Schechter himself used it to oppose any major break with either traditionalist or progressive elements within American Jewry of his day, while some of his successors argued that the idea became obsolete due to the great alienation of many from received forms, that had to be countered by innovative measures to draw them back. The Conservative rabbinate often vacillated on to which degree may the non-practicing, religiously apathetic strata be included as a factor within Catholic Israel, providing impulse for them in determining religious questions; even avant-garde leaders acquiesced that the majority could not serve that function. Right-wing critics often charged that the movement allowed its uncommitted laity an exaggerated role, conceding to its demands and successively stretching ''halakhic'' boundaries beyond any limit.&lt;ref&gt;Dorff, pp. 24-25;  Michael R. Cohen, ''The Birth of Conservative Judaism: Solomon Schechter's Disciples and the Creation of an American Religious Movement'', Columbia University Press, 2012. pp. 13-14, 18; Daniel H. Gordis, ''[http://danielgordis.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Positive-Historical-Judaism-Exhausted-Reflections-on-a-Movements-Future.pdf Positive-Historical Judaism Exhausted]''. in: [[Conservative Judaism (journal)|Conservative Judaism]], XLVII.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative leadership had limited success in imparting their worldview to the general public. While the rabbinate perceived itself as bearing a unique, original conception of Judaism, the masses lacked much interest, regarding it mainly as a compromise offering a channel for religious identification that was more traditional than [[Reform Judaism]] yet less strict than Orthodoxy. Only a low percentage of Conservative congregants actively pursue an observant lifestyle: in the mid-1980s, [[Charles Liebman]] and [[Daniel J. Elazar]] calculated that barely 3 to 4 per cent held to one quite thoroughly. This gap between principle and the public, more pronounced than in any other Jewish denomination, is often credited at explaining the decline of the Conservative movement. While some 41 per cent of American Jews identified with it in the 1970s, it had shrunk to an estimated 18 per cent (and 11 per cent among those under 30) in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Gordis, ''Struggle between Ideology and Popularity'', pp. 345-248; Geffen, Elazar, pp. 4-5, 73, 105-106; Gordis, [http://jewishreviewofbooks.com/articles/566/requiem-for-a-movement/ Conservative Judaism: A Requiem], [[Jewish Review of Books]], Winter 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish law==
{{main|Conservative Halakha}}

===Role===
Fidelity and commitment to ''[[Halakha]]'', while subject to criticism as disingenuous both from within and without, were and remain a cornerstone doctrine of Conservative Judaism:&lt;ref&gt;Neil Gillman, ''Doing Jewish Theology: God, Torah and Israel in Modern Judaism'', Jewish Lights, 2008. p. 188.; Dana Evan Kaplan, ''Contemporary American Judaism: Transformation and Renewal'', Columbia University Press, 2013. p. 123;  Leonard Levin, [https://www.academia.edu/7818172 Is the “Halakhic Authenticity” of Conservative Judaism a Broken Myth?] in: Daniel Plevan ed., ''Personal Theology: Essays in Honor of Neil Gillman'', Academic Studies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement views the legalistic system as normative and binding, and believes Jews must practically observe its precepts, like Sabbath, dietary ordinances, ritual purity, daily prayer with [[Teffilin|phylacteries]] and the like. Concurrently, examining [[Jewish history]] and [[rabbinic literature]] through the lens of academic criticism, it maintained that these laws were always subject to considerable evolution, and must continue to do so. ''Emet ve-Emunah'' titled its chapter on the subject with "The Indispensability of Halakha", stating that "''Halakha'' in its developing form is an indispensable element of a traditional Judaism which is vital and modern." Conservative Judaism regards itself as the authentic inheritor of a flexible legalistic tradition, charging the Orthodox with petrifying the process and Reform with abandoning it.

The tension between "tradition and change" – which were also the motto adopted by the movement since the 1950s – and the need to balance them were always a topic of intense debate within Conservative Judaism. In its early stages, the leadership opposed pronounced innovation, mostly adopting a relatively rigid position. [[Mordecai Kaplan]]'s Reconstructionism raised the demand for thoroughgoing modification without much regard for the past or ''halakhic'' considerations, but senior rabbis opposed him vigorously. Even in the 1940s and 1950s, when Kaplan's influence grew, his superiors rabbis Ginzberg, [[Louis Finkelstein]] and [[Saul Lieberman]] espoused a very conservative line. Since the 1970s, with the strengthening of the liberal wing within the denomination, the majority in the Rabbinic Assembly opted for quite radical reformulations in religious conduct, but rejected the Reconstructionist non-''halakhic'' approach, insisting that the legalistic method be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Elazer, Minz-Geffen, pp. 63-65.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''halakhic'' commitment of Conservative Judaism has been subject to much criticism, from within and without. Right-wing discontents, including the [[Union for Traditional Judaism]] which seceded in protest of the 1983 resolution to ordain women rabbis — adopted at an open vote, where all JTS faculty regardless of qualification were counted — contested the validity of this description, as well as progressives like Rabbi [[Neil Gillman]], who exhorted the denomination to cease describing itself as ''halakhic'' in 2005, stating that after repeated concessions, "our original claim has died a death by a thousand qualifications... It has lost all factual meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Gillman, ''Doing Jewish Theology'', p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main body entrusted with formulating rulings, responsa and statues is the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] (CJLS), a panel with 25 voting legalistic specialists and further 11 observers. There is also the smaller ''Va'ad ha-Halakha'' (Law Committee) of Israel's Masorti Movement. Every responsa must receive a minimum of six voters to be considered an official position of the CJLS. Conservative Judaism explicitly acknowledges the principle of ''halachik'' pluralism, enabling the panel to adopt more than one resolution in any given subject. The final authority in each Conservative community is the local rabbi, the ''mara d'atra'' (Lord of the Locality, in traditional terms), enfranchised to adopt either minority or majority opinions from the CJLS or maintain local practice. Thus, on the issue of admitting openly Homosexual rabbinic candidates, the Committee approved two resolutions, one in favour and one against; the JTS took the lenient position, while the [[Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano]] still adheres to the latter. Likewise, while most Conservative synagogues approved of egalitarianism for women in religious life, some still maintain traditional gender roles and do not count females for [[Minyan|prayer quorums]].

===Characteristics===
The Conservative treatment of ''Halakha'' is defined by several features, though the entire range of denominational ''Halakhic'' discourse cannot be sharply distinguished from either the traditional or Orthodox one. Rabbi [[David Golinkin]], who attempted to classify its parameters, stressed that quite often rulings merely reiterate conclusions reached in older sources or even Orthodox ones. for example, in the details of preparing Sabbath [[Eruv|ritual enclosures]], it draws directly on the opinions of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' and Rabbi [[Hayim David HaLevi]]. Another tendency prevalent among the movement's rabbis, yet again not particular to it, is the adoption of the more lenient positions on the matters at question — though this is not universal, and responsa also took stringent ones not infrequently.&lt;ref&gt;Golinkin, ''Halakha For Our Time'', pp. 5, 9, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more distinctive characterization is a greater proclivity to base rulings on earlier sources, in the ''[[Rishonim]]'' or before them, as far back as the Talmud. Conservative [[Posek|decisors]] frequently resort to less canonical sources, isolated responsa or minority opinions. They demonstrate more fluidity in regards to established precedent and continuum in rabbinic literature, mainly those by the later authorities, and lay little stress on the perceived hierarchy between major and minor legalists of the past. They are far more inclined to contend (''machloket'') with old rulings, to be flexible towards [[Minhag|custom]] or to wholly disregard it. This is especially expressed in less hesitancy to rule against or notwithstanding the major codifications of Jewish Law, like ''[[Mishne Torah]]'', ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and especially the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' with its [[Hamapah|Isserles Gloss]] and later commentaries. Conservative authorities, while often relying on the ''Shulchan Aruch'' themselves, criticize the Orthodox for relatively rarely venturing beyond it and overly canonizing Rabbi [[Joseph Karo]]'s work. In several occasions, Conservative rabbis discerned that the ''Shulchan Aruch'' ruled without firm precedent, sometimes deriving his conclusions from the ''[[Kabbalah]]''. An important example is the ruling of Rabbi Golinkin — contrary to the majority consensus among the ''[[Acharonim]]'' and the more prominent ''Rishonim'', but based on many opinions of the lesser ''Rishonim'' which is derived from a minority view in the Talmud — that the [[Sabbatical year (Bible)|Sabbatical Year]] is not obligatory in present times at all (neither [[List of Talmudic principles#De'oraita and derabanan|''de'Oraita'' nor ''de'Rabanan'']]) but rather an [[Hasidim|act of piety]].&lt;ref&gt;Golinkin, ''Halakha For Our Time'', pp. 26-31; See also [[Binyamin Lau]], ההלכה הלכה לאיבוד / הכרות עם התנועה הקונסרבטיבית מתוך עיון בכתבי ועד ההלכה, ''De'ot'', December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical considerations and the weight due to them in determining ''halakhic'' issues, mainly to what degree may modern sensibilities shape the outcome, are subject to much discourse. Right-wing [[Posek|decisors]], like Rabbi [[Joel Roth]], maintained that such elements are naturally a factor in formulating conclusions, but may not alone serve as a justification for adopting a position. The majority, however, basically subscribed to the opinion evinced already by Rabbi [[Seymour Siegel]] in the 1960s, that the cultural and ethical norms of the community, the contemporary equivalents of Talmudic ''[[Aggadah]]'', should supersede the legalistic forms when the two came into conflict and there was a pivotal ethical concern. Rabbi Elliot Dorff concluded that in contrast to the Orthodox, the denomination maintains that the juridical details and processes mainly serve higher moral purposes and could be modified if they no longer do so: "in other words, the ''Aggadah'' should control the ''Halakha''." The liberal Rabbi [[Gordon Tucker]], along with Gillman and other progressives, supported a far-reaching implementation of this approach, making Conservative Judaism much more ''Aggadic'' and allowing moral priorities an overriding authority at all occasions. This idea became very popular among the young generation, but it was not fully embraced either. In the 2006 resolution on homosexuals, the CJLS chose a middle path: they agreed that the ethical consideration of human dignity was of supreme importance, but not sufficient to uproot the express Biblical prohibition on not to lie with mankind as with womankind (traditionally understood as banning full anal intercourse). All other limitations, including on other forms of sexual relations, were lifted.&lt;ref&gt;Shai Cherry, ''[https://www.academia.edu/9047067/ Ethical Theories in the Conservative Movement]'', in: Elliot N. Dorff, Jonathan K. Crane ed. ''The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Ethics and Morality'', OUP 2012; Gillman, ''Doing Jewish Theology'', pp. 187-190; Silverstein, ''Modernists vs. Traditionalists'', p. 42; Dorff, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach is manifest in the great weight ascribed to sociological changes in deciding religious policy. The CJLS and the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] members frequently state that circumstances were profoundly transformed in modern times, fulfilling the criteria mandating new rulings in various fields (based on general talmudic principles like ''Shinui ha-I'ttim'', "Change of Times"). This, along with the ethical aspect, was a main argument for revolutionizing the role of women in religious life and embracing egalitarianism.

The most distinctive feature of Conservative legalistic discourse, in which it is conspicuously and sharply different from Orthodoxy, is the incorporation of critical-scientific methods into the process. Deliberations almost always delineate the historical development of the specific issue at hand, from the earliest known mentions until modern times. This approach enables a thorough analysis of the manner in which it was practiced, accepted, rejected or modified in various periods, not necessarily en sync with the received rabbinic understanding. Archaeology, philology and [[Judaic Studies]] are employed; rabbis use comparative compendiums of religious manuscripts, sometimes discerning that sentences were only added later or include spelling, grammar and transcription errors, changing the entire understanding of certain passages. This critical approach is central to the movement, for its historicist underpinning stresses that all religious literature has an original meaning relevant in the context of its formulation. This meaning may be analyzed and discerned, and is distinct from the later interpretations ascribed by traditional commentators. Decisors are also far more prone to include references to external scientific sources in relevant fields, like veterinarian publications in ''halakhic'' matters concerning livestock.&lt;ref&gt;Golinkin, ''Halakha For Our Time'', pp. 30-41; Dorff, pp. 101-107 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative authorities, as part of their promulgation of a dynamic ''Halakha'', often cite the manner in which the sages of old used rabbinic statues (''[[Takkanah]]'') that enabled to bypass prohibitions in the Pentateuch, like the ''[[Prozbul]]'' or ''[[Heter iska|Heter I'ska]]''. In 1948, when employing those was first debated, Rabbi [[Isaac Klein]] argued that since there was no consensus on leadership within Catholic Israel, formulation of significant ''takkanot'' should be avoided. Another proposal, to ratify them only with a two-thirds majority in the RA, was rejected. New statues require a simple majority, 13 supporters among the 25 members of the CJLS. In the 1950s and 1960s, such drastic measures&amp;nbsp;— as Rabbi Arnold M. Goodman cited in a 1996 writ allowing members of the priestly caste to marry divorcees, ''[[Acharonim|Later authorities]] were reluctant to assume such unilateral authority... fear that invoking this principle would create the proverbial slippery slope, thereby weakening the entire ''halakhic'' structure... thus imposed severe limitations on the conditions and situations where it would be appropriate''&amp;nbsp;— were carefully drafted as temporal, emergency ordinances (''Horaat Sha'ah''), grounded on the need the avoid a total rift of many nonobservant Jews. Later on, these ordinances became accepted and permanent on the practical level. The Conservative movement issued a wide range of new, thoroughgoing statues, from the famous 1950 responsum that allowed driving to the synagogue on the Sabbath and up to the 2000 decision to ban rabbis from inquiring about whether someone was a [[Mamzer|Bastard]], de facto abolishing this legal category.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Villa, ''[http://www.bmj.org.il/userfiles/akdamot/27/vila.pdf תהליכים בפסיקת ההלכה הקונסרבטיבית בימינו]'', Akdamot 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rulings and policies===
[[File:Kotel masorti.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|A mixed-gender, egalitarian Conservative service at [[Robinson's Arch]], [[Western Wall]]]]
The RA and CJLS reached many decisions through the years, shaping a distinctive profile for Conservative practice and worship. In the 1940s, when the public demanded mixed seating of both sexes in synagogue, some rabbis argued there was no precedent but obliged on the ground of dire need ([[It is time to work for the Lord|Eth la'asot]]); others noted that archaeological research showed no partitions in ancient synagogues. Mixed seating became commonplace in almost all congregations. In 1950, it was ruled that using electricity (that is, closure of an [[electrical circuit]]) did not constitute [[Activities prohibited on Shabbat#Igniting a fire|kindling a fire]] unto itself, not even in [[incandescent bulb]]s, and therefore was not a forbidden labour and could be done on the Sabbath. On that basis, while performing banned labours is of course forbidden – for example, video recording is still constituted as writing – switching lights and other functions are allowed, though the RA strongly urges adherents to keep the sanctity of the Sabbath (refraining from doing anything that may imitate the atmosphere of weekdays, like loud noise reminiscent of work).

The need to encourage arrival at synagogue also motivated the CJLS, during the same year, to issue a temporal statue allowing driving on that day, for that purpose alone; it was supported by decreeing that the combustion of fuel did not serve any of the acts prohibited during the construction of the [[Tabernacle]], and could therefore be classified, according to their interpretation of the [[Tosafists]]' opinion, as "redundant labour" (''Sh’eina Tzricha L’gufa'') and be permitted. The validity of this argument was heavily disputed within the denomination. In 1952, [[Kohen|members of the priestly caste]] were allowed to marry divorcees, conditioned on forfeiture of their privileges, as termination of marriage became widespread and women who underwent it could not be suspected of unsavory acts. In 1967, the ban on priests marrying converts was also lifted.

In 1954, the issue of ''[[agunot]]'' (women refused divorce by their husbands) was largely settled by adding a clause to the [[Ketubah|prenuptial contract]] under which men had to pay alimony as long as they did not concede. In 1968, this mechanism was replaced by a retroactive expropriation of the [[bride price]], rendering the marriage void. In 1955, more girls were celebrating [[Bat Mitzvah]] and demanded to be allowed ascents to the Torah, the CJLS agreed that the ordinance under which women were banned from this due to respect for the congregation (''Kvod ha'Tzibur'') was no longer relevant. In 1972 it was decreed that [[rennet]], even if derived from unclean animals, was so transformed that it constituted a wholly new item (''Panim Chadashot ba'u l'Khan'') and therefore all [[hard cheese]] could be considered [[kosher]].

The 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of women's rights on the main agenda. Growing pressure led the CJLS to adopt a motion that females may be counted as part of a quorum, based on the argument that only the ''Shulchan Aruch'' explicitly stated that it consist of men. While accepted, this was very controversial in the Committee and heavily disputed. A more complete solution was offered in 1983 by Rabbi [[Joel Roth]], and was also enacted to allow women rabbinic ordination. Roth noted that some decisors of old acknowledged that women may bless when performing positive time-bound commandments (from which they are exempted, and therefore unable to fulfill the obligation for others), especially citing the manner in which they assumed upon themselves the [[Counting of the Omer]]. He suggested that women voluntarily commit to pray thrice a day et cetera, and his responsa was adopted. Since then, female rabbis were ordained at JTS and other seminaries. In 1994, the movement accepted [[Judith Hauptman]]'s principally egalitarian argument, according to which equal prayer obligations for women were never banned explicitly and it was only their inferior status that hindered participation. In 2006, openly gay rabbinic candidates were also to be admitted into the JTS. In 2012, a commitment ceremony for same-sex couples was devised, though not defined as ''[[Erusin|kiddushin]]''. In 2016, the rabbis passed a resolution supporting transgender rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/06/01/the-rabbis-of-conservative-judaism-pass-a-resolution-supporting-transgender-rights/|title=The rabbis of Conservative Judaism pass a resolution supporting transgender rights|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative Judaism in the United States held a relatively strict policy regarding intermarriage. Propositions for acknowledging Jews by patrilineal descent, as in the Reform movement, were overwhelmingly dismissed. Unconverted spouses were largely barred from community membership and participation in rituals; clergy are banned from any involvement in interfaith marriage on pain of dismissal. However, as the rate of such unions rose dramatically, Conservative congregations began describing gentile family members as ''K'rov Yisrael'' (Kin of Israel) and be more open toward them. The Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism stated in 1995: "we want to encourage the Jewish partner to maintain his/her Jewish identity, and raise their children as Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mishkantefila.com/Intermarriage.html|title=LEADERSHIP COUNCIL OF CONSERVATIVE JUDAISM, Statement on Intermarriage, Adopted March 7, 1995|publisher=|access-date=May 5, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406140247/http://www.mishkantefila.com/Intermarriage.html|archive-date=April 6, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization and demographics==
The term ''Conservative Judaism'' was used, still generically and not yet as a specific label, already in the 1887 dedication speech of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] by Rabbi [[Alexander Kohut]]. By 1901, the JTS alumni formed the [[Rabbinical Assembly]], of which all ordained Conservative clergy in the world are members. As of 2010, there were 1,648 rabbis in the RA. In 1913, the [[United Synagogue of America]], renamed the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism in 1991, was founded as a congregational arm of the RA. The movement established the World Council of Conservative Synagogues in 1957. Offshoots outside North America mostly adopted the Hebrew name "Masorti", traditional', as did the Israeli Masorti Movement, founded in 1979, and the British Assembly of Masorti Synagogues, formed in 1985. The World Council eventually changed its name to "Masorti Olami", Masorti International. Besides the RA, the international [[Cantors Assembly]] supplies prayer leaders for congregations worldwide.

The United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, covering the United States and Canada, is by far the largest constituent of Masorti Olami. While most congregations defining themselves as "Conservative" are affiliated with the USCJ, some are independent. While accurate information of Canada is scant, it is estimated that some third of religiously affiliated Canadian Jews are Conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Dashefsky, Ira Sheskin, ''American Jewish Year, Book 2012'', Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the more traditional Canadian Council of Conservative Synagogues seceded from the parent organization. It numbered seven communities as of 2014. According to the [[Pew Research Center]] survey in 2013, 18 per cent of Jews in the United States identified with the movement, making it the second largest denomination in the country. [[Steven M. Cohen]] calculated that 962,000 U.S. Jewish adults considered themselves Conservative: 570,000 were registered congregants and further 392,000 were not members in a synagogue but identified. In addition, Cohen assumed in 2006 that 57,000 unconverted non-Jewish spouses were also registered (12 per cent of member households had one at the time): 40 per cent of members intermarry. Conservatives are also the most aged group: among those aged under 30 only 11 per cent identified as such, and there are three people over 55 for every single one aged between 35 and 44. As of November 2015, the USCJ had 580 member congregations (a sharp decline from 630 two years prior), 19 in Canada and the remainder in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Steven M. Cohen, ''[http://www.jta.org/2015/11/10/news-opinion/united-states/op-ed-for-conservative-jews-smaller-numbers-but-steady-engagement Conservative Jewry’s numbers plummeting, but core engagement steady]'', JTA, 10 November 2015; Uriel Heilman, ''[http://forward.com/news/325183/ Conservative Judaism Seeks To Rebrand Itself — But as What?]'', Jewish Daily Forward, 20 November 2015; Steven M.

Beyond North America, the movement has little presence – in 2011, Rela Mintz Geffen appraised there were only 100,000 members outside the U.S. (and the former figure including Canada).&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith R. Baskin]] ed., ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Judaism and Jewish Culture'', Cambridge University Press, 2011. p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; "Masorti AmLat", the MO branch in [[Latin America]], is the largest with 35 communities in [[Argentina]], 7 in [[Brazil]], 6 in [[Chile]] and further 11 in the other countries. The British Assembly of Masorti Synagogues has 13 communities and estimates its membership at over 4,000. More than 20 communities are spread across Europe, and there are 3 in Australia and 2 in Africa. The Masorti Movement in Israel incorporates some 70 communities and prayer groups with several thousand full members. In addition, while Hungarian [[Neolog Judaism]], with a few thousands of adherents and forty partially active synagogues, is not officially affiliated with Masorti Olami, Conservative Judaism regards it as a fraternal, "non-Orthodox but halakhic" movement.&lt;ref&gt;Elazar, Geffen. ''The Conservative Movement in Judaism''. pp. 133, 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American Jewish University, Bel Air, California.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies]] at [[American Jewish University]]]]
In New York, the JTS serves as the movement's original seminary and legacy institution, along with the [[Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies]] at the [[American Jewish University]] in Los Angeles; the [[Marshall T. Meyer Latin American Rabbinical Seminary]] (Spanish: ''Seminario Rabínico Latinoamericano Marshall T. Meyer''), in [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]]; and the [[Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies]] in [[Jerusalem]]. A Conservative institution that does not grant rabbinic ordination but which runs along the lines of a traditional [[yeshiva]] is the [[Conservative Yeshiva]], located in [[Jerusalem]]. The Neolog [[Budapest University of Jewish Studies]] also maintains connections with the denomination.

The current Chancellor of the JTS is Rabbi [[Arnold Eisen]], in office since 2008. The current dean of the  is [[Bradley Shavit Artson]]. The [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] is chaired by Rabbi [[Elliot N. Dorff]], serving since 2007. The [[Rabbinical Assembly]] is headed by President Rabbi William G. Gershon, as of 2016, and managed by executive vice-president Rabbi [[Julie Schonfeld]]. The USCJ is directed by CEO Rabbi Steven Wernick and President Margo Gold. In South America, Rabbi [[Abraham Skorka]] serves as Chancellor in the Seminario, and Daniel Cohn as president of Masorti AmLat. In Britain, the Masorti Assembly is chaired by Senior Rabbi [[Jonathan Wittenberg]]. In Israel, the Masorti movement is led by Rabbis Mauricio Balter and Dubi Haiyun, and chaired by [[Yizhar Hess]].

The global youth movement is known as NOAM, an acronym for No'ar Masorti; its North American chapter is called the [[United Synagogue Youth]]. [[Marom Israel]] is the Masorti movement's organization for students and young adults, providing activities based on religious pluralism and Jewish content. The Women’s League for Conservative Judaism is also active in North America.

The USCJ maintains the [[Solomon Schechter Day School Association|Solomon Schechter Day Schools]], comprising 76 [[day school]]s in 17 American states and 2 Canadian provinces serving Jewish children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schechternetwork.org/about-the-network/|title=About the Network|publisher=|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other "community day schools" that are not affiliated with Schechter take a generally Conservative approach, but unlike these, generally have "no barriers to enrollment based on the faith of the parents or on religious practices in the home".&lt;ref name="forward.com"&gt;Jennifer Siegel, [http://www.forward.com/articles/13533 Will Conservative Day Schools Survive?], June 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During the first decade of the 21st century, a number of schools that were part of the Schechter network transformed themselves into non-affiliated community day schools.&lt;ref name="forward.com"/&gt; The USCJ also maintains the [[Camp Ramah]] system, where children and adolescents spend summers in an observant environment.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Greenbaum, "Ramah: Paradigm for Conservative Jews", ''Ramah at 60'', National Ramah Commission, pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Scheff, "Romance at Ramah", ''Ramah at 60'', National Ramah Commission, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Positive-Historical School===
The rise of modern, centralized states in Europe by the early 19th century hearkened the end of Jewish judicial autonomy and social seclusion. Their communal corporate rights were abolished, and the process of [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] and [[acculturation]] that followed quickly transformed the values and norms of the public. Estrangement and apathy toward Judaism were rampant. The process of communal, educational and civil reform could not be restricted from affecting the core tenets of the faith. The new academic, critical study of Judaism (''[[Wissenschaft des Judentums]]'') soon became a source of controversy. Rabbis and scholars argued to what degree, if at all, its findings could be used to determine present conduct. The [[Torah im Derech Eretz|modernized Orthodox]] in Germany, like rabbis [[Isaac Bernays]] and [[Azriel Hildesheimer]], were content to cautiously study it while stringently adhering to the sanctity of holy texts and refusing to grant ''Wissenschaft'' any say in religious matters. On the other extreme were Rabbi [[Abraham Geiger]], who would emerge as the founding father of [[Reform Judaism]], and his supporters. They opposed any limit on critical research or its practical application, laying more weight on the need for change than on continuity.

[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Jewish Encyclopedia e15 334-0.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rabbi Zecharias Frankel]]
The [[Prague]]-born Rabbi [[Zecharias Frankel]], appointed chief rabbi of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] in 1836, gradually rose to become the leader of those who stood at the middle. Besides working for the civic betterment of local Jews and educational reform, he displayed keen interest in ''Wissenschaft''. But Frankel was always cautious and deeply reverent towards tradition, privately writing in 1836 that "the means must be applied with such care and discretion... that forward progress will be reached unnoticed, and seem inconsequential to the average spectator." He soon found himself embroiled in the great disputes of the 1840s. In 1842, during the second [[Hamburg Temple controversy]], he opposed the new Reform prayerbook, arguing the elimination of petitions for a future Return to Zion led by the Messiah was a violation of an ancient tenet. But he also opposed the ban placed on the tome by Rabbi Bernays, stating this was a primitive behaviour. In the same year, he and [[S.L. Rapoport]] were the only ones of nineteen respondents who negatively answered the [[Breslau]] community's enquiry on whether the deeply unorthodox Geiger could serve there. In 1843, Frankel clashed with the radical Reform rabbi [[Samuel Holdheim]], who argued that the act of [[marriage in Judaism]] was a civic (''memonot'') rather than sanctified (''issurim'') matter and could be subject to the Law of the Land. In December 1843 Frankel launched the magazine ''Zeitschrift für die Religiösen Interessen des Judenthums''. In the preamble, he attempted to present his approach to the present plight: "the further development of Judaism cannot be done through Reform that would lead to total dissipation... But must be involved in its study... pursued via scientific research, on a ''positive, historical'' basis." The term Positive-Historical became associated with him and his middle way. The ''Zeitschrift'' was, along the convictions of its publisher, neither dogmatically orthodox nor overly polemic, wholly opposing [[Biblical criticism]] and arguing for the antiquity of custom and practice.

In 1844, Geiger and like-minded allies arranged a conference in [[Braunschweig]] that was to have enough authority (since 1826, Rabbi [[Aaron Chorin]] called for the convocation of a new ''[[Sanhedrin]]'') to debate and enact thoroughgoing revisions. Frankel was willing to agree only to a meeting without any practical results, and refused the invitation. When the protocols, which contained many radical statements, were published, he denounced the assembly for "applying the scalpel of criticism" and favouring the spirit of the age over tradition. However, he later agreed to attend the second conference, held in [[Frankfurt am Main]] on 15 July 1845&amp;nbsp;– in spite of warnings from Rapoport, who cautioned that compromise with Geiger was impossible and he would only damage his reputation among the traditionalists. On the 16th, the issue of Hebrew in the liturgy arose. Most present were inclined to retain it, but with more German segments. A small majority adopted a resolution stating there were subjective, but no objective, imperatives to keep it as the language of service. Frankel then astounded his peers by vehemently protesting, stating it was a breach with the past and Hebrew was of dire importance and great sentimental value. The others immediately began quoting all passages in rabbinic literature allowing prayer in the vernacular. Frankel could not contend with the ''halakhic'' validity of their decision as he perceived it as a sign of profound differences between them. On the 17th he formally withdrew, publishing a lambasting critique of the procedures. "Opponents of the conference, who feared he went to the other side," noted historian Michael A. Meyer, "now felt reassured of his loyalty".

[[File:Posithis.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Frankel's speech in the protocol of the Frankfurt conference, mentioning "Positive-Historical Judaism" (second row, 2-4 words from left)]]
The rabbi of Saxony had many sympathizers, who supported a similarly moderate approach and change only on the basis of the authority of the Talmud. When Geiger began preparing a third conference in Breslau, [[Hirsch Bär Fassel]] convinced Frankel to organize one of his own in protest. He invited colleagues to an assembly in [[Dresden]], which was to be held on 21 October 1846. He announced that one measure he was willing to countenance was the possible abolition of the [[second day of festivals]], though only based on a broad consensus and much deliberation. Attendants were to include Rapoport, Fassel, [[Adolf Jellinek]], [[Leopold Löw]], [[Michael Sachs]], [[Abraham Kohn]] and others. However, the Dresden assembly soon drew heated Orthodox resistance, especially from Rabbi [[Jacob Ettlinger]], and was postponed indefinitely.

In 1854, Frankel was appointed Chancellor in the new [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]], the first modern rabbinical seminary in Germany. His opponents on both flanks were incensed. Geiger and the Reform camp long accused him of theological ambiguity, hypocrisy and attachment to stagnant remnants, and now protested the "medieval" atmosphere in the seminary, which was mainly concerned with teaching Jewish Law. The hardline Orthodox [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], who fiercely opposed ''Wissenschaft'' and emphasized the divine origin of the entire ''halakhic'' system in the Theophany at Sinai, was deeply suspicious of his beliefs, use of science and constant assertions the Law was flexible and evolving.

The final schism between Frankel and the Orthodox occurred after the 1859 publication of his ''Darke ha-Mishna'' (Ways of the [[Mishna]]). He heaved praise on the [[Chazal|Beatified Sages]], presenting them as bold innovators, but not once affirmed the divinity of the [[Oral Torah]]. On the ordinances classified as [[Law given to Moses at Sinai]], he quoted [[Asher ben Jehiel]] that stated several of those were only apocryphally dubbed as such; he applied the latter's conclusion to all, noting they were "so evident ''as if'' given at Sinai". Hirsch branded him a heretic, demanding he announce whether he believed that both the Oral and Written Torah were of celestial origin. Rabbis [[Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach]], [[Solomon Klein]] and others published more complaisant tracts, but also requested an explanation. Rapoport marshaled to Frankel's aid, assuring that his words were merely reiterating ben Jehiel's and that he would soon release a statement that would belie Hirsch's accusations. But then the Chancellor of Breslau issued an ambiguous defence, writing his book was not concerned with theology and avoiding giving any clear answer. Now even Rapoport joined his critics.

[[File:Breslauseminar.png|thumb|left|[[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]]]]
Hirsch succeeded, severely tarnishing his rival's reputation among most concerned. Along with fellow Orthodox Rabbi [[Azriel Hildesheimer]], he launched a protracted public campaign through the 1860s. They ceaselessly stressed the chasm between an Orthodox understanding of ''halakha'' as derived and revealed, applied differently to different circumstances and subject to human judgement and possibly error, yet unchanging and divine in principle – as opposed to an evolutionary, historicist and non-dogmatic approach in which past authorities were not just elaborating but consciously innovating, as taught by Frankel. Hildesheimer often repeated that this issue utterly overshadowed any specific technical argument with the Breslau School (the students of which were often more lenient on matters of headcovering for women, [[Chalav Yisrael]] and other issues). He was concerned that Jewish public opinion perceived no practical difference between them; though he cared to distinguish the observant acolytes of Frankel from the Reform camp, he noted in his diary: "how meager is the principal difference between the Breslau School, who don silk gloves at their work, and Geiger who wields a sledgehammer." In 1863, when Breslau faculty member [[Heinrich Graetz]] published an article where he appeared to doubt the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messianic belief]], Hildesheimer immediately seized upon the occasion to prove once more the dogmatic, rather than practical, divide. He denounced Graetz as a heretic.   

The Positive-Historical School was influential, but never institutionalized itself as thoroughly as its opponents. Apart from the many graduates of Breslau, [[Isaac Noah Mannheimer]], [[Adolf Jellinek]] and Rabbi [[Moritz Güdemann]] led the central congregation in [[Vienna]] along a similar path. In Jellinek's local seminary, [[Meir Friedmann]] and [[Isaac Hirsch Weiss]] followed Frankel's moderate approach to critical research. The rabbinate of the liberal [[Neolog Judaism|Neolog public]] in Hungary, which formally separated from the Orthodox, was also permeated with the "Breslsu spirit". Many of its members studied there, and its [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Budapest]] was modeled after it, though the assimilationist congregants cared little for rabbinic opinion. In Germany itself, Breslau alumni founded in 1868 a short-lived society, the Jüdisch-Theologische Verein. It was dissolved within a year, boycotted by both Reform and Orthodox. [[Michael Sachs]] led the Berlin congregation in a very conservative style, eventually resigning when an organ was introduced in services. [[Manuel Joël]], another of the Frankelist party, succeeded Geiger in Breslau. He maintained his predecessor's truncated German translation of the liturgy for the sake of compromise, but returned the full Hebrew text.

The Breslau Seminary and the Reform [[Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums]] maintained very different approaches; but on the communal level, the former's alumni failure to organize or articulate a coherent agenda, coupled with the declining prestige of Breslau and the conservatism of the Hochschule's alumni – a necessity in heterogeneous communities which remained unified, especially after the Orthodox gained the right to secede in 1876 – imposed a rather uniform and mild character on what was known in Germany as "Liberal Judaism". In 1909, 63 rabbis associated with Breslau approach founded the Freie jüdische Vereinigung, another brief attempt at institutionalization, but it too failed soon. Only in 1925 did the Religiöse Mittelpartei für Frieden und Einheit succeed in driving the same agenda. It won several seats in communal elections, but was small and of little influence.

===Jewish Theological Seminary===
[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|thumb|The [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], the main rabbinical seminary of Conservative Judaism]]
Jewish immigration to the United States bred an amalgam of loose communities, lacking strong tradition or stable structures. In this free-spirited environment, a multitude of forces was at work. As early as 1866, Rabbi Jonas Bondi of New York wrote that a Judaism of the "golden middleway, which was termed Orthodox by the left and heterodox or reformer by the right" developed in the new country. The rapid ascendancy of [[Reform Judaism]] by the 1880s left few who opposed it: merely a handful of congregations and ministers remained outside the [[Union of American Hebrew Congregations]]. These included [[Sabato Morais]] and Rabbi [[Henry Pereira Mendes]] of the elitist [[Sephardi]] congregations, along with rabbis [[Bernard Drachman]] (ordained at Breslau, though he regarded himself as Orthodox) and Henry Schneeberger.

While spearheaded by radical and principled Reformers like Rabbi [[Kaufmann Kohler]], the UAHC was also home to more conservative elements. President [[Isaac Meyer Wise]], a pragmatist intent on compromise, hoped to forge a broad consensus that would turn a moderate version of Reform to dominant in America. He kept the [[kosher|dietary laws]] at home and attempted to assuage traditionalists. On 11 July 1883, apparently due to negligence by the Jewish caterer, non-kosher dishes were served to UAHC rabbis in Wise's presence. Known to posterity as the "[[trefa banquet]]", it purportedly made some guests abandon the hall in disgust, but little is factually known about the incident. In 1885, the traditionalist forces were bolstered upon the arrival of Rabbi [[Alexander Kohut]], an adherent of Frankel. He publicly excoriated Reform for disdaining ritual and received forms, triggering a heated polemic with Kohler. The debate was one of the main factors which motivated the latter to compose the [[Pittsburgh Platform]], which unambiguously declared the principles of Reform Judaism: "to-day we accept as binding only the moral laws, and maintain only such ceremonies as elevate and sanctify our lives."

The explicit wording alienated a handful of conservative UAHC ministers: Henry Hochheimer, [[Frederick de Sola Mendes]], [[Aaron Wise]], [[Marcus Jastrow]], and [[Benjamin Szold]]. They joined Kohut, Morais and the others in seeking to establish a traditional rabbinic seminary that would serve as a counterweight to [[Hebrew Union College]]. In 1886, they founded the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York City. Kohut, professor of Talmud who held to the Positive-Historical ideal, was the main educational influence in the early years, prominent among the founders who encompassed the entire spectrum from progressive Orthodox to the brink of Reform; to describe what the seminary intended to espouse, he used the term "Conservative Judaism", which had no independent meaning at the time and was only in relation to Reform. In 1898, Pereira Mendes, Schneeberger and Drachman also founded the [[Orthodox Union]], which maintained close ties with the seminary.

The JTS was a small, fledgling institution with financial difficulties, and was ordaining merely a rabbi per year. But soon after Chancellor Morais' death in 1897, its fortunes turned. Since 1881, a wave of Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe was inundating the country – by 1920, 2.5 million of them had arrived, increasing American Jewry tenfold. They came from regions where civil equality or emancipation were never granted, while acculturation and modernization made little headway. Whether devout or irreligious, they mostly retained strong traditional sentiments in matters of faith, accustomed to old-style rabbinate; the hardline [[Agudas HaRabbanim]], founded by emigrant clergy, opposed secular education or vernacular sermons, and its members spoke almost only [[Yiddish]]. The Eastern Europeans were alienated by the local Jews, who were all assimilated in comparison, and especially aghast by the mores of Reform. The need to find a religious framework that would both accommodate and Americanize them motivated [[Jacob Schiff]] and other rich philanthropists, all Reform and of German descent, to donate $500,000 to the JTS. The contribution was solicited by Professor [[Cyrus Adler]]. It was conditioned on the appointment of [[Solomon Schechter]] as Chancellor. In 1901, the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] was established as the fraternity of JTS alumni.

[[File:SolomonSchechter3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Solomon Schechter]]]]
Schechter arrived in 1902, and at once reorganized the faculty, dismissing both Pereira Mendes and Drachman for lack of academic merit. Under his aegis, the institute began to draw famous scholars, becoming a center of learning on par with HUC. Schechter was both traditional in sentiment and quite unorthodox in conviction. He maintained that theology was of little importance and it was practice that must be preserved. He aspired to solicit unity in American Judaism, denouncing sectarianism and not perceiving himself as leading a new denomination: "not to create a new party, but to consolidate an old one". The need to raise funds convinced him that a congregational arm for the Rabbinical Assembly and the JTS was required. On 23 February 1913, he founded the United Synagogue of America (since 1991: United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism), which then consisted of 22 communities. He and Mendes first came to major disagreement; Schechter insisted that any alumnus could be appointed to the USoA's managerial board, and not just to serve as communal rabbi, including several the latter did not consider sufficiently devout, or who tolerated mixed seating in their synagogues (though some of those he still regarded as Orthodox). Mendes, president of the Orthodox Union, therefore refused to join. He began to distinguish between the "Modern Orthodoxy" of himself and his peers in the OU, and "Conservatives" who tolerated what was beyond the pale for him. However, this first sign of institutionalization and separation was far from conclusive. Mendes himself could not clearly differentiate between the two groups, and many he viewed as Orthodox were members of the USoA. The epithets "Conservative" and "Orthodox" remained interchangeable for decades to come. JTS graduates served in OU congregations; many students of the Orthodox [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] and members of the OU's [[Rabbinical Council of America]], or RCA, attended it. In 1926, RIETS and the JTS even negotiated a possible merger, though it was never materialized. Upon Schechter's death in 1915, the first generation of his disciples kept his non-sectarian legacy of striving for a united, traditional American Judaism. He was replaced by Cyrus Adler.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, ''The Birth of Conservative Judaism'', pp. 80–82.&lt;/ref&gt;
The USoA grew rapidly as the Eastern European immigrant population slowly integrated. In 1923 it already had 150 affiliated communities, and 229 before 1930. Synagogues offered a more modernized ritual: English sermons, choir singing, late Friday evening services which tacitly acknowledging that most had to work until after the Sabbath began, and often mixed-gender seating. Men and women sat separately with no partition, and some houses of prayer already introduced family pews. Motivated by popular pressure and frowned upon by both RA and seminary faculty – in its own synagogue, the institute maintained a partition until 1983 – this was becoming common among the OU as well. As both social conditions and apathy turned American Jews away from tradition (barely 20 per cent were attending prayers weekly), a young professor named [[Mordecai Kaplan]] promoted the idea of transforming the synagogue into a community center, a "Shul with a Pool", a policy which indeed stymied the tide somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Wertheimer]], ''[http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/details.cfm?PublicationID=3040 The Conservative Synagogue]'', Cambridge University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, the RA also established its own Committee of Jewish Law, entrusted with determining ''halakhic'' issues. Consisting of seven members, it was chaired by the traditionalist Rabbi [[Louis Ginzberg]], who already distinguished himself in 1922, drafting a responsa that allowed to use grape juice rather than fermented wine for ''[[Kiddush]]'' on the background of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. Kaplan himself, who rose to become an influential and popular figure within the JTS, concluded that his fellow rabbis' ambiguity in matters of belief and the contradiction between full observance and critical study were untenable and hypocritical. He formulated his own approach of [[Judaism as a Civilization]], rejecting the concept of [[Revelation]] and any supernatural belief in favour of a cultural-ethnic perception. While valuing received mores, he eventually suggested giving the past "a vote, not a veto". Though popular among students, Kaplan's nascent [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionism]] was opposed by the new traditionalist Chancellor [[Louis Finkelstein]], appointed in 1940, and a large majority among the faculty.

Tensions within the JTS and RA grew. The Committee of Jewish Law consisted mainly of scholars who had little field experience, almost solely from the seminary's Talmudic department. They were greatly concerned with ''halakhic'' licitness and indifferent to the pressures exerted on the pulpit rabbis, who had to contend with an Americanized public which cared little for such considerations or for tradition in general. In 1935, the RA almost adopted a groundbreaking motion: Rabbi Louis Epstein offered a solution to the [[agunah]] predicament, a clause that would have had husbands appoint wives as their proxies to issue divorce. It was repealed under pressure from the Orthodox Union. As late as 1947, CJL Chair Rabbi [[Boaz Cohen]], himself a historicist who argued that the Law evolved much through time, rebuked pulpit clergy who requested lenient or radical rulings, stating he and his peers were content to "progress in inches... Free setting up of new premises and the introduction of novel categories of ritual upon the basis of pure reason and thinking would be perilous, if not fatal, to the principles and continuity of Jewish Law."

===A third movement===
The boundaries between Orthodox and Conservative Judaism in America were institutionalized only in the aftermath of World War II. The 1940s saw the younger generation of JTS graduates less patient with the prudence of the CJL and Talmud faculty in face of popular demand. Kaplan's Reconstructionism, while its fully committed partisans were few, had much influence. The majority among recent alumni eschewed the epithet "Orthodox" and tended to employ "Conservative" exclusively. Succeeding Schechter's direct disciples who headed the RA, JTS and United Synagogue in the interwar period, a new strata of activist leaders was rising. Rabbi [[Robert Gordis]], RA president in 1944–1946, represented the junior members in advocating more flexibility; Rabbi [[Jacob Agus]], a RIETS graduate who joined the body only in 1945, clamored that "we need a law making body, not a law interpreting committee." Agus argued that the breach between the Jewish public and tradition was too wide to be bridged conventionally, and that the RA would always remain inferior to the Orthodox as long as it retained its policy of merely adopting lenient precedents in rabbinic literature. He offered to extensively apply the tool of ''[[takkanah]]'', rabbinic ordinance.

In 1946, a committee chaired by Gordis issued the ''Sabbath and Festival Prayerbook'', the first clearly Conservative liturgy: references to the sacrificial cult were in the past tense instead of a petition for restoration, and it rephrased blessings such as "who hast made me according to thy will" for women to "who hast made me a woman". During the movement's national conference in [[Chicago]], held 13–17 May 1948, the pulpit rabbis in the RA gained the upper hand. Spurned by Gordis, Agus and fellow leaders, They voted to reorganize the CJL into a Committee of Jewish Law and Standards, enfranchised to issue ''takkanot'' by a majority. Membership was conditioned on having experience as a congregational rabbi, and unseasoned JTS faculty were thus denied entrance. While the RA was asserting a Conservative distinctive identity, the seminary remained more cautious. Finkelstein opposed sectarianism and preferred the neutral epithet "traditional", later commenting that "Conservative Judaism is a gimmick to get Jews back to real Judaism". He and the very right-wing Talmud professor [[Saul Lieberman]], who maintained ties with the Orthodox while also viewing them as obstructionist and ossified, dominated the JTS, providing a counterweight to the liberals in the Assembly. Kaplan, meanwhile, spent more time on consolidating his Society for Advancement of Judaism. [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], who espoused a [[Jewish mysticism|mysticist understanding of Jewish religion]], also became an important figure among the faculty.

The CJLS now proceeded to demonstrate its independence. Sabbath was widely desecrated by a large majority of Jews, and the board believed arrival at synagogues should be encouraged. They therefore enacted an ordinance that allowed driving on the Sabbath (for worship alone) and the use of electricity. The driving responsum was later severely criticized by Conservative rabbis, and was charged with imparting the movement was overly keen to condone the laxity of congregants. It also signified the final break with the Orthodox, who were themselves being bolstered by more strictly observant immigrants from Europe. In 1954, the RCA reverted its 1948 ruling that allowed the use of microphones on Sabbath and festivals and declared that praying without a partition between sexes was banned. Though enforced slowly&amp;nbsp;— in 1997, there were still seven OU congregations with no physical barrier, and so-called "[[Conservadox]]" remain extant&amp;nbsp;— these two attributes became a demarcation line between Orthodox and Conservative synagogues. RA converts were denied ablution in Orthodox ritual baths, and rabbis from one denomination would gradually cease serving in the other's communities.

Rather than a force within American Judaism, the JTS-centered movement emerged as a third denomination. The historicist and critical approach to ''halakha'', as well as other features, were emphasized by leaders eager to demonstrate their uniqueness. In their efforts to solidify a coherent identity, Conservative thinkers like [[Mordecai Waxman]] in his 1957 ''Tradition and Change'', ventured beyond Schechter's deem conceptions to Rabbi Zecharias Frankel and Breslau, presenting themselves as its direct inheritors via [[Alexander Kohut]] and others. The CJLS continued to issue groundbreaking ordinances and rulings.

The postwar decades were a time of immense growth for the Conservative movement. Most of the 500,000 decommissioned Jewish GI's left the densely populated immigrant neighbourhoods of the East Coast, moving to [[suburbia]]. They were Americanized but still retained traditional sentiments, and Reform Judaism was too radical for most. The United Synagogue of America offered Jewish education for children and a familiar religious environment which was also comfortable and not strict. It expanded from 350 communities by 1945 to 832 by 1971, becoming the largest denomination, with some 350,000 member households (1.5 million people) at synagogues and over 40 per cent of American Jewry identifying with it in polls, adding an estimated million more non-registered supporters.

Already in a 1955 study, [[Marshall Sklare]] defined Conservative Judaism as the quintessential American Jewish movement, but recognized the gap between laity and clergy, noting "rabbis now recognize that they are not making decisions or writing responsa, but merely taking a poll of their membership." Most congregants, commented [[Edward S. Shapiro]], were "Conservative Jews because their rabbi kept kosher and the Sabbath... Not because of their religious behavior." The movement established its presence outside the U.S. and Canada: In 1962, the young Rabbi [[Marshall Meyer]] founded the [[Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano]] in [[Buenos Aires]], which would serve as the basis for Conservative expansion in South America. In 1979, four communities formed the Israel Masorti Movement. Rabbi [[Louis Jacobs]], dismissed in 1964 from the British Orthodox rabbinate on the charge of heresy after espousing a non-literal understanding of the Torah, joined with the Conservatives and founded his country's first Masorti community. The new branches were all united within the World Council of Synagogues, later to be named Masorti Olami.

The denomination peaked in numbers in the 1970s. During that decade, the tensions between the various elements within it intensified. The right wing, conservative in ''halakhic'' matters and often adhering to a verbal understanding of revelation, was dismayed by the failure to bolster observance among the laity and the resurgence of Orthodoxy. The left was influenced by the Reconstructionists, who formed [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College|their own seminary]] in 1968 and were slowly coalescing, as well as the growing appeal of Reform, which turned more traditional and threatened to sway congregants. While the rightists opposed further modifications, their peers demanded them. The [[Chavurah]] movement, consisting of nonaligned prayer quorums of young (and frequently, Conservative-raised) worshipers who sought a more intense religious experience, also weakened congregations. In 1972, the liberal wing gained an influential position with the appointment of Gerson D. Cohen as JTS Chancellor. During the same year, after Reform began to ordain female rabbis, a strong lobby rose to advocate the same. The CJLS rapidly enacted an ordinance which allowed women to be tallied for a ''[[minyan]]'', and by 1976 the percentage of synagogues allowing them to bless during the reading of the Torah grew from 7 per cent to 50 per cent. In 1979, ignoring the denominational leadership, [[Beth Israel Congregation of Chester County]] accepted the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College|RRC]]-ordained Rabbi [[Linda Joy Holtzman]]. Pressures to allow women to assume rabbinical positions was mounting from the congregational level, though the RA agreed to delay any action until the JTS scholars would concur.

Female ordination was a matter of great friction until 1983, when Rabbi [[Joel Roth]] devised a solution that entailed women voluntarily accepting the obligation to pray regularly. The leadership passed it not by scholarly consensus but via a popular vote of all JTS faculty, including non-specialists. Two years later, the first JTS-ordained female rabbi, [[Amy Eilberg]], was admitted into the RA. [[David Weiss Halivni]], professor of the Talmud faculty, claimed that Roth's method must have required waiting until a considerable number of women did prove sufficient commitment. He and his sympathizers regarded the vote as belying any claim to ''halakhic'' integrity. They formed the [[Union for Traditional Judaism|Union for Traditional Conservative Judaism]] in 1985, a right-wing lobby which numbered some 10,000 supporters from the Conservative observant elite. The UTJC withdrew from the denomination and erased the word "Conservative" in 1990, attempting to merge with moderate Orthodox organizations.

In the very same year, the Reconstructionist also seceded fully, joining the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]] under observer status. The double defection narrowed the movement's spectrum of opinions, at a time when large swaths of congregants were abandoning in favour of Reform, which was more tolerant of intermarriage. RA leaders were engaged in introspection through the later 1980s, resulting in the 1988 ''Emet ve-Emunah'' platform, while Reform slowly bypassed them and became the largest denomination.

After the issue of egalitarianism for women subsided, LGBT acceptance replaced it as the main source of contention between the declining right-wing wing and the liberal majority. A first attempt was rebuffed in 1992 by a harsh responsum written by Roth. The retirement of Chancellor [[Ismar Schorsch]], a staunch opponent, allowed the CJLS to endorse a motion which still banned anal intercourse but not any other physical contact, and allowed the ordination of openly LGBT rabbis, in 2006. Roth and three other supporters resigned from the panel in protest, claiming the responsum was not valid; Masorti affiliates in South America, Israel and Hungary objected severely. The Seminario is yet to accept the resolution, while several Canadian congregations seceded from the United Synagogue in 2008 to form an independent union in protest of the slide to the left. Since the 2013 Pew survey, which assessed that only 18 per cent of American Jews identify with it, Conservative leadership is engaged in attempting to solve the denomination's demographic crisis.

{{Oriental Orthodox sidebar|expanded=practices}}

The [[Copts]] ([[Christian]]s of [[Egypt]]), who belong mostly to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], observe [[fasting]] periods according to the [[Coptic calendar]]. These fasting periods are exceeded by no other Christian community except the [[Orthodox Tewahedo]]. Out of the 365 days of the year, Copts often fast between 180 to 210 days.

== Fasting ==
There are spiritual, symbolic, and even practical reasons for [[fasting]]. In the fall from Paradise man became possessed of a carnal nature; he adopted carnal practices. Through fasting, the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christians]] attempt to recapture Paradise in their lives by refraining from those carnal practices. In general, Coptic fasting means adhering to a [[veganism|vegan]] diet, thus abstaining from meat, fish, eggs, dairy, and other animal products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Goodlife: Egyptian Christians (Copts) on Lenten fasting and penance|author=Noel James Debien|date=February 26, 2012 |publisher=[[ABC Local Radio]]|url=http://www.abc.net.au/sundaynights/stories/s3440723.htm|quote=The vegan lenten fast of Egypt's native Christian community}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are those who see fasting as an exercise in self-denial and Christian obedience that serves to rid the believer of his or her ''passions'' (what most modern people would call "addictions"). These often low-intensity and hard-to-detect addictions to food, television or other entertainments, sex, or any kind of self-absorbed pleasure-seeking are seen as some of the most significant obstacles for man seeking closeness to [[God]]. Through struggling with fasting, the believer comes face to face with the reality of his condition - the starting point for genuine repentance.

All Coptic Christians are expected to fast following a prescribed set of guidelines. Dispensation is however granted under special circumstances, such as pregnancy and sickness.

The time and type of fast is generally uniform in [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]. The times of fasting are dependent on the ecclesiastical calendar. In the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, this calendar is the Coptic calendar, which corresponds largely to the calendars of other [[Christian denomination]]s. Observance of the [[fasting]] periods is very strict in the Coptic community.

==Observation periods==
The major fasting periods during the ecclesiastical calendar year are:

===The Fast of the Advent===
The ''[[Nativity Fast]]'' ([[Advent]] or Winter Lent) is the 40 days preceding the [[Nativity of Jesus]] ([[Christmas]]) on 29 [[Koiak]] (January 7, which also falls on 28 [[Koiak]] in leap years). The 40 days correspond to the 40 days that the [[Moses]] fasted on the mountain before receiving the [[Ten Commandments]] from God, which were at that time considered the word of God to his people. Thus, with Christ being the [[Logos|Word of God]], the [[Christians]] fast those 40 days in preparation of receiving the Word of God in flesh at the Feast of the Nativity. 

An additional 3 days were added at the beginning of the 40 days of Advent during the 10th century to commemorate the three days that Copts fasted before God awarded them the miracle of moving the [[Mokattam]], which lies within a suburb of [[Cairo]], on the hands of [[Simon the Tanner]] during the rule of the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid caliph]] [[al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah]]. Thus the fast of Advent begins on 16 [[Hathor (month)|Hathor]] (November 25, which also falls on 15 Hathor in leap years). The three added days are considered a separate fast rather than part of the fast of Advent.

===The Fast of Nineveh===
{{See also|Fast of Nineveh}}
It commemorates the three days that the people of [[Nineveh]] fasted in repentance after [[Jonah]]'s call for them to repent. For Christians, these three days are a direct parallel of and a prophecy about the three days that Christ spent in the tomb, just like the three days Jonah spent in the belly of the fish. The fast of Nineveh begins on a Monday, two weeks before the Monday that marks the beginning of [[Great Lent]].

This fast was borrowed from [[Syriac Christianity]], as one of the [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Patriarchs of Alexandria]] of Syriac descent decided to adapt it for the Church of Alexandria.

===The Fast of Great Lent===
''[[Great Lent]]'' consists of eight weeks (55 days), which correspond to the 40 days that Christ fasted on the mountain. With the remaining fifteen days for a week of preparation, the Holy Week which is the last week of fasting, and Lazuras Saturday. It precedes [[Palm Sunday]], and the [[Holy Week]], which precede [[Easter]]. The seven days of the [[Holy Week]] is also a period of rigorous fasting.

There are an additional seven days of fasting before the beginning of the Great Lent, which serve as a preparatory period. Often called "Pre-Lenten Fast" or "Preparatory Week", and also what was explained before.

===The Fast of the Holy Week- The Holy Pascha - Passion Week ===
This is the week preceding [[Easter]], which climaxes with the [[Crucifixion]] on [[Good Friday]] and ends with the joyous Easter. 

It is to be noted that since they are not related to each other dogmatically, in [[early Christianity]], the Great Lent fast and the Holy Week fast were fasted separately. It was later in Church history that the Fathers of the Church saw it as spiritually beneficial to join them concurrently, and later added the Preparatory week to enable the faithful to prepare themselves spiritually and bodily to experience the benefits of the fasts.

===The Fast of the Apostles===
The [[Apostles' Fast]] varies in length from two to six weeks (15 to 49 days). It begins on the Monday following the Sunday of [[Pentecost]] and extends to the feast day of [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle]] on 5 [[Epip]] (July 12). This fasting period commemorates the struggles of the [[Apostles]] to preach Christianity to the world. Its length varies yearly depending on the date of Easter, which in turn determines the date of [[Pentecost]]. The people who are fasting are allowed to eat vegan food and fish.

===The Fast of the Dormition of the Mother of God ===
This fast is fifteen days long and precedes the feast of the [[Dormition of the Mother of God]]. This fasting period is fasted to ask for the intercessions of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]]. It begins on 1 [[Mesori]] (August 7) and ends on 16 [[Mesori]] (August 22).

===Wednesday and Friday Weekly Fasts===
Coptic Christians also fast every Wednesday in commemoration of Christ's betrayal by [[Judas Iscariot]], and every Friday in commemoration of his [[crucifixion]]. Exceptions are the Wednesdays and Fridays between Easter and Pentecost (the 50-day period of joy during which fasting is not permitted) and any day whereon a Major Feast falls.

===The Paramon Fasts===
The day or days preceding the Feast of the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] and the Feast of [[Theophany]] is/are a fast day(s) in preparation for the Feast day. (See the rules for the fasting days of the Paramon Fasts)

==Rules==

===General dietary rules===
According to the Coptic tradition of fasting periods, the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] is mainly [[vegan]], cooked with either oil or water. No animal products (meat, poultry, fish, milk, eggs, butter, etc.) are allowed.

====Permissibles====
It is also to be noted that fish is permissible during the Advent fast, the Apostles' Fast, and the fast of the Dormition of Mary except on Wednesdays and Fridays of these fasts. Lent and the Holy Week fasts are stricter than the other fasts in their discipline. Those who wish to take a vow of strict discipline for the fast of Mary may also do so.

===Strict abstinence===
A strict abstinence period, where no food or drink whatsoever may be taken, is encouraged for those who can endure it.  The original tradition of the Church is for this period of abstinence to begin at midnight and last through sunset.  Those who cannot endure this length of fast are still encouraged to strictly abstain from all types of food and drink between midnight and a certain time in the day, depending on each individual's strength and spiritual needs (this is usually based on the suggestion of the person's father of confession).  For many parishioners, fasting is more likely to end at noon (the hour when [[Christ]] was placed on the Cross) or three o'clock on the afternoon (the hour when [[Christ]] died on the Cross). Strict abstinence is also expected to be kept on [[Good Friday|Great Friday]] between midnight and the end of the [[Good Friday|Great Friday]] prayers (usually around 6pm).

===Regarding the Fast of the Paramon of the Feasts of the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] and of [[Theophany]]===
* The Paramon Fast is a strict fasting day with abstinence and no fish preceding the Nativity or Theophany Feast.  
* If the Feast day falls on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday, then the Paramon is simply the day immediately preceding the Feast day.
* If the Feast day falls on a Sunday, the Paramon abstinence day is substituted by the Friday before, since Saturday is a non-abstaining day.  In this case, the Paramon Fast is considered as the two days, Friday and Saturday, with only Friday as a Paramon abstinence day.
* If the Feast day falls on a Monday, then the Paramon abstinence day is similarly substituted with the Friday before, since Saturday and Sunday are non-abstaining days.  In this case, the Paramon Fast is considered as the three days, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, with only Friday as a Paramon abstinence day.  This is the only case where a third previous day is included in the Paramon Fast.
* If the Feast day falls on Friday, then the Paramon Fast becomes a two-day fast since [[Fasting and abstinence of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria#Wednesday and Friday Weekly Fasts|Wednesday is already a strict fasting day with abstinence]].

===Non-fasting periods===
There are 7 weeks during the year where there is no fasting even on Wednesday and Friday. These are the 7 weeks between [[Easter]] and [[Pentecost]]. These 7 weeks are fast-free because this period is a period of joy for [[Christians]] in celebration of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection of Christ]].

===Abstinence Fasting observance before partaking of the Holy Communion===
[[Coptic Orthodox]] [[Christians]] who expect to receive communion of the [[Eucharist]] on a certain day do not eat or drink at all during the nine hours preceding the partaking of the communion or from midnight of the previous night, whichever is longer.

===Canonical observance===
Strict fasting with abstinence is canonically forbidden on Saturdays and Sundays due to the festal character of the Sabbath and Resurrectional observances respectively. Holy (Bright) Saturday is the only Saturday of the year where a strict fast is kept.

===Principle of piety===
It is considered a greater sin to advertise one's fasting than to not participate in the fast. Fasting is a purely personal communication between the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christian]] and God, and in fact has no place whatsoever in the public life of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]].

==Exceptions==
These strict fasting rules are usually relaxed by priests on an individual basis to accommodate for illness or weakness. Abstinence from [[sexual intercourse]] is also encouraged but not mandatory, and largely depends on the decision of each couple. The [[Coptic Orthodox]] fasting periods are designed to foster spiritual development and focus on [[liturgical]] practices.

Fasting is not generally viewed as a hardship, but rather a privilege and joy in preparing for the coming “Feast Day”.

'''Michael John Burkett''' (born January 31, 1967), known professionally as '''Fat Mike''', is an American musician and producer. He is the bassist and lead vocalist for the [[punk rock]] band [[NOFX]] and the bassist for the punk rock supergroup cover band [[Me First and the Gimme Gimmes]]. Fat Mike started out with his first band [[False Alarm (band)|False Alarm]] in 1982. He recorded the song Self Destruction that was on the False Alarm album, Buspar For Bedbug. Mike played in False Alarm until 1983. False Alarm went on to make 3 records and record with [[Cheetah Chrome]] of the [[Dead Boys]]. [[Dee Dee Ramone]] of the [[Ramones]] wrote and recorded the song False Alarm for the band with [[Paul Kostabi]] False Alarm's guitar player.

==Musical career==
While attending [[Beverly Hills High School]], Mike began his musical career with the band False Alarm. After the band split up in 1983, he met [[Eric Melvin]] and [[Erik Sandin]] and formed the original line-up of NOFX. He has also appeared as a guest-vocalist on a number of other bands' tracks including "Peter Brady" on [[Screeching Weasel]]'s 1993 album, "[[Anthem for a New Tomorrow]]." Other appearances include "Beware" by Randy, "Mr. Coffee" and "Lazy" by [[Lagwagon]], and can be heard heckling and requesting "Free Bird" at the end of the [[Lunachicks]] song, "Missed It," off their 1996 album, "Pretty Ugly," which he also produced. He also appears as a guest vocalist on the [[Dropkick Murphys]] single  "[[Going Out In Style]]". Mike is the owner and founder of [[Fat Wreck Chords]], one of the biggest independent labels in North America.

Mike recorded the "[[Cokie the Clown]]" EP with NOFX, playing Cokie on both the cover of the EP and the music video for the title-track, "Cokie the Clown". In the video, Mike dresses as Cokie and puts white powder into his squirting flower, which in the song he describes as "my own special blend of ex, coke, and K". Cokie then walks around [[Chicago]] squirting powder in pedestrians' faces, as chronicled in the song itself. The video was shot during the punk music festival [[Riot Fest]].

Fat Mike has made several appearances as Cokie the Clown, but one of his most memorable was at [[Emo's]], a popular nightclub in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] on March 20, 2010 at the [[South by Southwest]] festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fat Wreck Chords 2010 SXSW Showcase at Emo’s|url=http://www.itallhappened.com/fat-wreck-chords-2010-sxsw-showcase-2010-03-20|work=It All Happened – A Living History of Live Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recounted several graphic and disturbing stories about his life, and played several songs both previously released and unreleased. He also tricked several members of the audience into drinking tequila, before showing them a video of himself filling a partially full bottle of tequila to the top with urine to shocked reactions. The stunt was later revealed as a joke on NOFX's website, which showed Fat Mike switching out the urine bottle for an untainted one before making audience members drink it.  Mike has since been banned from Emo's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinertia.com/music-art/nofx-fat-mike-banned-in-austin/ |title=Banned in Austin: NOFX’s Fat Mike Shocks SXSW |publisher=TheInertia.com |date=September 13, 2010 |accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Mike premiered a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] titled ''[[Home Street Home (musical)|Home Street Home]],'' which he co-wrote with Soma Snakeoil and [[Jeff Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nofxs-fat-mike-preps-punk-musical-20141203|title=NOFX's Fat Mike Preps Punk Musical|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

===Punkvoter.com===
Fat Mike founded the website Punkvoter.com in 2004 in an effort to mobilize the punk community to vote [[George W. Bush]] out of office in that year's presidential election. He had never been very active in politics before then, admitting that he never even voted until [[United States elections, 2000|2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garofoli |first=Joe |url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/joegarofoli/article/Beyond-PunkVoter-Fat-Mike-Burkett-built-a-2558592.php |title=Beyond PunkVoter: "Fat" Mike Burkett built a legitimate interest in politics among apolitical punk listeners, but who'll carry that torch in 2008? |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle, May 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was driven into political activism because of Bush, whom he viewed as "the most ridiculous president in the history of presidents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Selm |first=Nick |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;p_product=AWNB&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id=(%2014147A5A2119B1A0%20)&amp;p_docid=14147A5A2119B1A0&amp;p_theme=aggdocs&amp;p_queryname=14147A5A2119B1A0&amp;f_openurl=yes&amp;p_nbid=Q54I4EWDMTQxMzQzMzg4My41NDc1MDQ6MToxMDpFQlNDTzYxMDY0&amp;&amp;p_multi=NIIB |title=Fat Mike, unfiltered |publisher=NUVO, September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punkvoter.com targeted 18-to-25-year-old punk fans and other disenfranchised young people and encouraged them to vote Bush out of office. At its peak, the site was getting 15 million hits a day and ultimately raised over $1 million. Speculation has arose over the long-term viability, and genuine nature of what Punkvoter.com was all about. Many musicians, some very closely associated to Burkett, have claimed that Burkett's real goal with Punkvoter.com was to just sell t-shirts, cd's, and false hope to young, misguided, uneducated, lazy American citizens that Burkett knew he could manipulate given his status as a prominent figure in the Punk Rock community. Chris Hannah of Canadian Prog-Punk band [[Propagandhi]], in regards to the Punkvoter.com movement, was quoted as saying "What were my criticisms against the punk-voter movement? Well, for starters, where is it? Most real, political movements don't just fizzle out after the group's greedy, war-mongering candidate loses an election." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flota |first=Brian |url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQwMTMwMl9fQU41?sid=71f3abdf-bc24-487a-a709-28f8d8f8ba6e@sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=33&amp;hid=4211&amp;format=EB |title=The Politics of Post-9/11 Music: Sound, Trauma, and the Music Industry in the Time of Terror |publisher=Ashgate, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rock Against Bush===
As with Punkvoter.com, Mike organized the [[Rock Against Bush]] campaign to mobilize punk fans and musicians against George W. Bush. Fat Mike's band NOFX, along with many other well-known punk artists including [[Alkaline Trio]], [[Green Day]] and [[Jello Biafra]], embarked on a tour of American college campuses in the months leading up to the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]. Mike hoped to go beyond just protest and actually educate kids about why they should vote against Bush. At the shows, he would hand out free DVDs of ''Uncovered: The Whole Truth About The Iraq War'', a documentary that questions the Bush administration's motives in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cave |first=Damien |url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=71f3abdf-bc24-487a-a709-28f8d8f8ba6e%40sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=48&amp;hid=4211&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=edsggo&amp;AN=edsgcl.122680574 |title=Punks Mosh for Votes |publisher=Rolling Stone, May 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To coincide with the tour, Mike released two Rock Against Bush compilation albums on Fat Wreck Chords featuring new music from some of the bands on the label. The albums sold over 650,000 copies and proceeds helped fund the tour, as well as going toward magazine ads and billboards in swing states.

==Personal life==
Burkett lives in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. He attended college at [[San Francisco State University]] and graduated in 1990 with a bachelor's degree in Social Science and a minor in Human Sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xpress.sfsu.edu/archives/life/012615.html|title=Golden Gate [X]press : SF State alumnus still rockin' after 25 years|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the book "NOFX  The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories", Burkett has said that he received the moniker "Fat Mike" from "one of the guys from [the band] Subculture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alulis|first1=Jeff|title=NOFX The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories|date=2016|publisher=Da Capo PRESS|isbn=978-0-306-82477-7|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wO_cCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=%22one+of+the+guys+from+Subculture%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zc46bVLswQ&amp;sig=0HUn1uHd7mRpDv4mCcawihuP0HQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3mPeal9rOAhXNsh4KHfocAdsQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22one%20of%20the%20guys%20from%20Subculture%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is of [[Jewish]] heritage, but is an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2011/08/30/punk-jews-why-we-made-it/|title=‘Punk Jews,’ Why we made it?|work=Algemeiner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2011-02-humanist-anthems-for-your-ipod-playlist|title=Humanist Anthems for Your iPod Playlist|work=American Humanist Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his wife Erin divorced in 2010 after 18 years of marriage. They have a daughter named Darla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_wdaX-rXlI&amp;feature=player_embedded |title=Spontan intervju med NOFX |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, Mike appeared in the documentary ''[[The Other F Word]]'', an analysis of punk rock fatherhood.

Fat Mike formerly owned a [[gastropub]]-style restaurant in the [[Park Slope]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn, NY]] called Thistle Hill Tavern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2010/05/fat_mikes_not-s.php |title=Fat Mike's Not-So-Punk Restaurant Thistle Hill, Now Open in Park Slope! |publisher=VillageVoice.com |date=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been into [[BDSM]] for years: he has had a [[Dungeon (BDSM)|dungeon]] in his house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/read/nofxs-fat-mike-lives-a-deep-sm-lifestyle |title=NOFX'S Fat Mike lives a deep S&amp;M lifestyle|publisher=Noisey |date=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fat Mike has numerous tattoos, including one on his left arm that features a golfing [[dominatrix]] and her bound caddy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fatherly.com/how-to-talk-to-your-children-about-tattoos-1212760254.html How To Explain Awkward Tattoos, From A Guy With A Golfing Dominatrix On His Shoulder] ''Fatherly''.

Fat Mike announced his engagement to adult film actress Soma Snakeoil on January 28, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interviewly.com/i/mike-burkett-jan-2014-reddit|title=This is Fat Mike from NOFX.

He has been vocal about assisting his terminally ill mother's death, describing the episode in a song called "La Pieta" which featured in NOFX's audiobook version of The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories.

==Fan assault incident, 2014==
On November 5, 2014 at a NOFX show in [[Sydney, Australia]], Fat Mike had complained about a neck injury and had asked the audience not to throw objects at him and grab him while on stage as it caused him pain. While playing the song "Linoleum", a fan climbed onstage and put his arm around Mike's neck, to which Mike responded by elbowing him to the ground and then kicking him in the face. The fan suffered some bruising on his face but had no major injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/nofxs-fat-mike-assaults-fan-stage-apologizes-twitt-211561|title=NOFX's Fat Mike assaults fan on stage, apologizes on Twitter|publisher=[[The A.V.

[[File:Gero azala.jpg|thumb|Cover]]
'''''Gero''''' (meaning 'later', '''''Guero''''' in contemporary spelling) is a 16th-century [[asceticism|ascetic]] book in [[Basque language|Basque]] composed by [[Pedro Agerre]] (also spelled Pedro D'Aguerre), better known as Axular. It is considered one of the masterpieces of classic Basque prose and literature altogether. 

It was published at [[Bordeaux]] in 1643 under the patronage of [[Bertrand D'Etchauz]], [[History of the Basques#Modern Period|Basque]] archbishop of [[Tours]] (1617-1641). The book was written after the period of the harrowing "[[Witchcraft|witch]]" persecution ([[Pierre de Lancre]]'s intervention in Labourd). The book, written in an instructive tone, dwells on the idea of the harm and misfortunes issued from putting off one's religious duties, on the grounds that men need to turn to Christ with no delay. 

While the title's tagline reads «divided into two parts», only the existence of one book has been attested. Basque scholar Piarres Lafitte claimed that both parts had been merged into one. By contrast, former president of the [[Euskaltzaindia|Basque Language Academy]] [[Luis Villasante]] held that the second part had been actually lost for ever. '''''Gero''''' shows no mysticism, but the book intends to explain and prove an ascetic idea, arranged as if it was to be addressed from the pulpit to the parishioners.

Its accomplished, elaborate language in classic [[Lapurdian]] dialect turned it into a writing model for later writers from [[Labourd]].

Heresiology developed as a part of the emerging [[orthodoxy]] in the Christian [[state church of the Roman Empire]].

In Islam, heresiology surveyed both the various Muslim sects, and also other religions such as Christianity and Judaism. Some like [[Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi]] and [[Ibn Hazm]] wrote polemical works, arguing the falseness of sects and religions other than their own.

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}

The '''history of the Jews in Königsberg''' reaches back to the 1530s. By the 20th century [[Königsberg]] had one of the larger Jewish communities within the [[German Reich]]. The city's Jewish community was eliminated by emigration and then [[The Holocaust]] during [[World War II]].

==History==
[[image:Falkenheim-Hugo.jpg|thumb|Hugo Falkenheim, leader of Königsberg's Jews during World War II]]
The first [[Jews]] in [[Königsberg]], [[Germany]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], [[Russia]]) were the doctors Isaak May (1538) and Michel Abraham (1541) at the court of [[Albert, Duke of Prussia]]. In 1680&lt;ref&gt;Armstedt, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jolowicz, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; or 1682&lt;ref&gt;Mühlpfordt, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick William, Elector of Prussia|Frederick William]], the Great Elector, allowed the city's Jewish residents to rent space for prayer at the Eulenburgsches Haus (later Hotel Deutsches Haus) on Burgfreiheit's Kehrwiederstraße (later Theaterstraße). Most were merchants from the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

A permanent Jewish community began to develop in Königsberg only by 1704, when a Jewish cemetery was designated. Jewish students were first admitted to the [[University of Königsberg]] in 1712.&lt;ref&gt;Denny, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1750 [[Frederick II of Prussia]] issued an edict which classified Jews in Prussia into several categories. The main division was between so-called "tolerated Jews" (''geduldete Juden'') who could remain in Prussia, and "not tolerated Jews" who were required to leave upon reaching adulthood, as well as "protected Jews" (''[[Schutzjude|Schutz-Juden]]'') . The "protected Jews", whose number was initially limited to a total of 203 families in all of Brandenburg-Prussia, were allowed to reside in a city but had no right of mobility. Non-protected "tolerated Jews", who comprised the vast majority of Jewish inhabitants of the Prussian kingdom, were not allowed to permanently settle in Prussia, were not allowed to purchase land or houses or to engage in any commercial or economic activity, and generally were not allowed to live in the cities unless they served as employees or clients of the "protected Jews".&lt;ref&gt;Mendelssohn, pp. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Jewish population of Königsberg in the 18th century was fairly low, although this changed as the restrictions became relaxed over the course of the 19th century. In 1753 Frederick II allowed the city's Jews to build a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[synagogue]] on [[Vorstadt (Königsberg)|Vordere Vorstadt's]] Schnürlingsdamm, which was completed in 1756. [[Georg David Kypke]] served as its government inspector. In 1756 there were 29 families of "protected Jews" in Königsberg, which increased to 57 by 1789. The total number of Jewish inhabitants was less than 500 in the middle of the 18th century, and around 800 by the end of it, out of a total population of almost 60,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

The city counted 300 Jewish residents in 1756, 900 residents in 1800, and 1,027 in 1817, with much of the increase coming from the [[Russian Empire]]. Although the first synagogue, the Alte Synagoge, burned down in 1811, it was rebuilt on nearby Synagogenstraße and dedicated in 1815. [[Jewish emancipation]] occurred in 1812 during the [[Prussian reforms]], but Jews were largely restricted from officer and government professions. Full emancipation only occurred in 1869 through the [[North German Confederation]].

Königsberg's Jewish community flourished during the 19th century and early 20th century, peaking with a population of 5,000 by 1880.&lt;ref name="A142"&gt;Albinus, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; The first history of the city's Jews was written by [[Heymann Jolowicz]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Gause II, p. 596&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 the [[Adass Jisroel]], an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] branch, opened their own synagoge on Synagogenstraße near the Alte Synagoge. The Orthodox numbered only 25-30 families, but included influential bankers, merchants, and jewelers.&lt;ref&gt;Gause II, p. 700&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Progressive Judaism (Germany)|liberal]] [[Königsberg Synagogue|Neue Synagoge]] (new synagogue) was built along Lindenstraße in [[Lomse]] from 1894 to 1896 to serve the majority of the Jewish population. A third group included the city's Polish and Lithuanian Jews.  The number of Russians Jews increased in the late 19th century due to [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]]. Königsberg's Jewish citizens were divided between [[Zionism|Zionists]] and the [[Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens]].&lt;ref&gt;Gause II, p. 701&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Königsberg's Jews served during [[World War I]]. By 1917 there were 820 Königsberg Jews in the [[Prussian Army]], including 80 volunteers. They included 15 recipients of the [[Iron Cross]] First Class and 102 recipients of the Iron Cross Second Class.&lt;ref name="A142"/&gt;

Due to anti-Semitism and persecution in the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;Denny, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Königsberg's Jewish population was in decline by the time of the [[Nazi Party]] took control through the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' in 1933. In that year there were only 3,500 Jews living in the city.&lt;ref name="G146"&gt;Gause III, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-Jewish legislation in prewar Nazi Germany]], enforced by [[Erich Koch]], restricted business and led many Königsberg Jews to emigrate, mostly to the United States and Great Britain. [[Michael Wieck]] wrote of the discrimination he suffered from the [[Hitler Youth]].&lt;ref&gt;Denny, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; At the opening of the 1935 [[Ostmesse]], [[Hjalmar Schacht]] criticized the persecution to no avail.&lt;ref name="G147"&gt;Gause III, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Persecution led the Jewish community to create a separate Jewish school for 82 students in April 1935; it grew to encompass 180 students in 6 classes with 4 teachers by October 1935.&lt;ref name="G148"&gt;Gause III, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1938 the propaganda paper ''Der Student der Ostmark'' published the names of 201 Jewish business, 38 doctors, and 22 lawyers remaining in the city, which was used by the [[Sturmabteilung]] during the [[Kristallnacht|Night of Broken Glass]] in November 1938.&lt;ref name="G147"/&gt; The New Synagogue was burned down, the Orthodox Adass Jisroel synagogue and two cemeteries were vandalized; the Jewish school was attacked but reopened afterwards, as was the Orthodox synagogue, where Michael Wieck became Bar Mitzva in mid-1941. Many of the Jewish residents were shipped to [[Nazi concentration camps]] within Germany.

There were only 1,585 Jews in the city in May 1939, after which emigration was prohibited.&lt;ref name="G146"/&gt; Prominent Königsberg Jews who committed suicide during [[World War II]] were the esteemed councilor [[Paul Stettiner]], consul [[Felix Japha]] and his wife, and the doctor [[Lotte Gottschalk]]. Her uncle, politician [[Alfred Gottschalk (politician)|Alfred Gottschalk]], starved to death in 1942.&lt;ref name="G148"/&gt; The leader of the Jewish community, [[Hugo Falkenheim]], was smuggled to safety. Those who remained in 1942 were shipped to concentration camps, including [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] in occupied [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Kaiserwald concentration camp|Kaiserwald]] in occupied [[Latvia]], and camps in [[Maly Trostenets extermination camp|Minsk]] in occupied [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Denny, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The lawyer [[Max Lichtenstein]] died at Theresienstadt, while the councilor [[Marta Harpf]] died at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Gause III, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Only a small number of Königsberg's Jews survived [[The Holocaust]] and World War II;&lt;ref name="A142"/&gt; the number of victims is unknown.&lt;ref name="G148"/&gt; Many remaining German Jews left Königsberg, then [[Kaliningrad]], in April 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Among them [[Michael Wieck]], who delivered a detailed report on the years between 1933 and 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denny, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, a community of approximately 2000 Jews remains in the region,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Kaliningrad-Jews-battle-circus-over-restoring-synagogue&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Königsberg Synagogue|New Synagogue]] being rebuilt in the same location and as an exact replica of the building destroyed in 1938.

The statistics for '''Islam in Colombia''' estimate a total [[Muslim]] population of 14,000 (0.03%) according to a [[Pew Research Center]] report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Topics/Demographics/Muslimpopulation.pdf Muslimpopulation.pdf] pewforum.org&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of [[Islamic]] communities in [[Colombia]], the most important of which, according to their size, are in [[Bogotá#Religion|Bogotá]], [[Maicao]] and [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]]. There are also Islamic centers in [[San Andrés, San Andrés y Providencia|San Andrés]], [[Nariño]], [[Santa Marta]] and [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]].

There are also primary and secondary Islamic schools in Bogotá and [[Maicao]]. Maicao plays host to the continent's third largest mosque, the [[Mosque of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab]]. Most Muslims in Colombia are descendants of Arab immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine during the late 19th to early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Klich | first=Ignacio, Jeff Lesser | year=1992 | title=Arab and Jewish immigrants in Latin America | publisher=Routledge| isbn=0-7146-4873-6| page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afro-Colombian Muslims in Buenaventura, Colombia’s main Pacific port city, have over the years embraced the teachings of the [[Nation of Islam]], mainstream [[Sunni]] Islam, and the [[Shia]] denomination &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/23/colombia-islam-muslim-buenaventura | title=How Islam took root in one of South America’s most violent cities | date=January 17, 2017 | accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Ahmadiyya]] Community also has a presence in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.prensalibre.com/noticias/Islamismo-pretende-llegar-varios-paises_0_820118010.html | title=Islamismo pretende llegar a varios países | date=November 30, 2014 | accessdate=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muslim population of [[Lesotho]] in 2013 is about 3000 plus throughout the country. Most of the population are from [[South Asia]] ([[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Sri Lanka]]). South Asian Muslims, being a more prominent and established community, settled in the country to conduct business and trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matope|first1=Tsitsi|title=Lesotho's Diverse cultures|url=http://www.publiceyenews.com/site/2011/05/05/a-taste-of-lesotho%E2%80%99s-diverse-cultures/|website=Public Eye Online|accessdate=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their presence has been well noted since the early 1900s, when a few families migrated from [[Durban|Durban, Kwazulu-Natal]]. There are various mosques and prayer halls in Lesotho at the Capital City Maseru to Butha-Buthe and other places around geography of Lesotho. Jamaat Khana at Jackpot Market, Bus Stop Jamaat Khana and Thabong are the places where people offer their Friday Prayer in Maseru City. The vast majority of [[Muslim]]s are [[Sunni]].

{{Islam by country}}
The documented history of '''Islam in Ireland''' dates to the 1950s. The number of [[Muslim]]s in [[Ireland]] has increased since the 1990s,&lt;ref name="Islam Ireland's 3rd largest faith"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7119049.stm Islam Ireland's 3rd largest faith], BBC 29 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; mostly through immigration. According to the 2016 Irish census the number of Muslims resident in the Republic was 63,443.&lt;ref name="2016census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/population/2017/Chapter_8_Religion.pdf|title=Change in religion|publisher=Central Statistics Office|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest mention of Ireland in Muslim sources originates in the works of [[Al-Idrisi]] in his ''[[Tabula Rogeriana]]'' mentioned ''Irlandah-al-Kabirah'' (Great [[Ireland]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, 2009, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drogheda crest.svg|thumb|left|Drogheda crest, containing the star and crescent of King John who granted the towns charter in 1210.]]
On 20 June 1631 a North African pirate ship captained by [[Jan Janszoon]] (Murad Reis) sailed into Roaring Water Bay in West Cork and raided coastal village of Baltimore. A crew of slave traders roused the villagers from their beds, slaughtered anyone who resisted, and herded 107 people into the hold of their waiting ship. Men, women and children were taken, even down to babies in the cradle. The villagers were sold into a life of slavery in the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Donnell|first1=Leeanne|last2=O'Brien|first2=Liam|title=From Baltimore to Barbary - The Village That Disappeared|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/2010/1012/646537-radio-documentary-baltimore-barbary-pirates/|accessdate=16 June 2016|publisher=RTÉ Radio 1|date=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Abdülmecid I|Sultan Abdülmecid]] declared his intention to send £1,000 along with three ships full of food to the Irish people. According to Abdullah Aymaz in an article in ''The Fountain'' magazine, the British administration tried to block the ships, but the food arrived secretly at [[Drogheda]] harbor and was left there by Ottoman sailors.{{sfn|Akay|2012}}{{sfn|Aymaz|2007}} Shipping records relating to the port appear not to have survived. Newspaper reports suggest that ships from [[Thessaloniki]] in the Ottoman Empire sailed up the [[River Boyne]] in May 1847,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=Antoinette|title=New evidence shows Turkey delivered food to Ireland during the famine|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/New-evidence-shows-Turkey-delivered-food--to-Ireland-during-the-famine-156681255.html|publisher=IrishCentral|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it has also been claimed that the river was dry at the time. A letter in the Ottoman archives of [[Turkey]], written by prominent Irishmen, explicitly thanks the Sultan for his help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abdülmecid'in İrlanda halkına yaptığı yardım 'efsane' değilmiş |url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/gundem_abdulmecidin-irlanda-halkina-yaptigi-yardim-efsane-degilmis_1256853.html |publisher=Zaman |accessdate=20 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813130441/http://www.zaman.com.tr/gundem_abdulmecidin-irlanda-halkina-yaptigi-yardim-efsane-degilmis_1256853.html |archivedate=13 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisational history of Islam in Ireland is complex, not least because of the immense variety of ethnic backgrounds of Irish Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Scharbrodt, Oliver, "Islam in Ireland". 318 – 336 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), ''Ireland's new religious movements''. Cambridge Scholars, 2011; {{ISBN|978-1-4438-2588-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Islamic Society in Ireland was established in 1959. It was formed by students studying in Ireland and was called the Dublin Islamic Society (later called the Islamic Foundation of Ireland).&lt;ref name="dcu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbrick.dcu.ie/~isoc/mosques.html |title=The Islamic Foundation of Ireland |publisher=DCU Islamic Society |accessdate=13 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715123242/http://www.redbrick.dcu.ie/~isoc/mosques.html |archivedate=15 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time there was no mosque in Dublin. The students used their homes and later rented halls for [[Jum'ah]] (Friday) and [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] (Muslim holiday) prayers. In 1976 the first mosque and Islamic Centre in Ireland was opened in a four-storey building at 7 Harrington Street, Dublin 8{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}. Among those who contributed to the cost of the Mosque and Islamic Centre was the late King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]]. In 1981 the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs of [[Kuwait]] sponsored a full-time [[Imam]] for the Mosque.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In 1983, the present building of the Dublin Mosque and Islamic Centre was bought, renovated and the headquarters of the Society moved from Harrington Street to 163 South Circular Road, Dublin 8.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In [[Cork (city)|Cork]], prayer halls are located in housing estates. Cork's Muslim community operates out of an industrial estate, while hoping to raise money to build a new mosque.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corkmosque.org/aboutus.html About the Cork Mosque] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414034421/http://www.corkmosque.org/aboutus.html |date=14 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[Moosajee Bhamjee]] became the first (and to date only) [[Muslim]] [[Teachta Dála]] (Member of Irish Parliament).&lt;ref name="indo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/the-muslimirish-prove-to-be-a-surprisingly-moderate-bunch-65169.html|title=The Muslim-Irish prove to be a surprisingly moderate bunch|date=19 December 2006|publisher=Irish Independent|accessdate=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2016 Irish census, there were 63,443 Muslims living in the Republic of Ireland,&lt;ref name="sample2011t2016"/&gt; representing a 29% increase over the figures for the 2011 census. However the Islamic community is very much a minority, especially when compared to the numbers of Christians and those of no religion. Cities and towns with the highest Muslim population according to the 2016 census:
27,586 Dublin City and suburbs;
3,633 Cork City and suburbs;
3,432 Limerick City and suburbs;

The Muslim community in Ireland is diverse and growing rapidly, and its numbers are not determined by the country's history to the same extent as the UK and France, where the majority of Muslims are immigrants or descendants of immigrants from former colonies, or Germany and Austria, where the majority of Muslims are Turkish migrant workers and their descendants. Just over 55 per cent of Muslims were either Asian or African nationals with 30.7 per cent having Irish nationality.&lt;ref name="cso.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/statistics/popnclassbyreligionandnationality2006.htm|title=Server Error 404 - CSO - Central Statistics Office|website=www.cso.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The census also revealed that of the 31,779 Muslims resident in Ireland at the time of the census, 9,761 were Irish nationals, less than the number of Asians (10,649) although more than the 6,909 African nationals. The census of 2011 found there were 49,204 Muslims in Ireland, "a sharp rise on five years previously".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/newsandevents/pressreleases/2012pressreleases/pressreleasecensus2011profile7religionethnicityandirishtravellers/|title=Press Release Census 2011 Profile 7 Religion, Ethnicity and Irish Travellers - CSO - Central Statistics Office|website=www.cso.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim immigration at the end of the 90s was caused by the [[Economy of the Republic of Ireland|Irish economic boom]] and asylum seekers from diverse Muslim countries, and in the 20-year period between 1991 and 2011 the Muslim population increased 1000%, from 0.1% to 1.1% of the population of the republic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Mosques and denominations==
[[File:Flickr - Tab59 - La mosquée clonskeagh à Dublin.jpg|thumb|175px|right|The [[Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland]].]]

In 2003, the Islamic Cultural Centre with help from [[Foras na Gaeilge]] announced plans to translate the [[Koran]] from Arabic into [[Irish language|Irish]] for the first time.&lt;ref name="irko"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2840591.stm|title=Quran to be translated into Irish|date=11 March 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the plan foundered because of difficulties in finding speakers of both languages and as of 2018 no translation yet exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/plan-to-translate-the-koran-into-irish-revived-ll969vrpn|title=Plan to translate the Koran into Irish revived|first=Aaron|last=Rogan|date=24 April 2018|publisher=|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006 an umbrella organisation, the [[Irish Council of Imams]], was established. It represents 14 imams in Ireland, of both the Sunni and Shia traditions. It is chaired by Imam Hussein Halawa (Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland) and its deputy chairman is Imam Yahya Al-Hussein (Islamic Foundation of Ireland). Imam Dr. Umar Al-Qadri (Al-Mustafa Islamic Cultural Centre Dublin 15), Imam Salem (Cork Mosque), Imam Khaled (Galway Mosque) and Imam Ismael Khotwal (Blackpits Mosque) are among its founding members.

===Ahmadiyya===
{{main|Ahmadiyya in Ireland}}
The [[Ahmadiyya| Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] was formally registered in the country in 1992, during the era of the [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad|Fourth Caliph]]. However, there have been Ahmadi Muslims in the country since the 1960s. There are two Ahmadiyya mosques in the Republic of Ireland, one in Galway in the western coast, named the [[Galway Mosque]], and one in [[Lucan, Dublin|Lucan]] near the eastern coast in [[County Dublin]]. The Galway Mosque is purpose built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/persecuted-muslims-build-first-irish-mosque-in-galway-1.1935635 | title=Persecuted Muslims build first Irish mosque in Galway | publisher=Irish Times | author=Lorna Siggins | accessdate=20 September 2014 | date=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/26086|title=Galway Ahmadiyyas hope new mosque will be a ‘symbol of peace’ and understanding|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most Ahmadiyya Moslems in Ireland are refugees from countries where they are persecuted.

[[File:Y Goleuad Oct 30 1869.jpg|thumb|Y Goleuad Oct 30 1869]]'''John Davies''' (1832 - 1904) was a Welsh printer, editor, and journalist. He was born in [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] in North Wales, and as a young man began an apprenticeship as printer in the 'North Wales Chronicle' office. Later he joined the staff team as a reporter.


In 1866 a weekly paper called the 'Cronicl Cymru' began production, and he was appointed editor. Two years later, he established himself as a printer in [[Caernarfon|Caernarvon]], and in October 1869 began publication of the weekly paper 'Y Goleuad' from his office. A number of years later he decided to sell his printing business, and took up a managerial position at Pugh and Jones's Bank, in Caernarvon. He was a popular figure in the Caernarvon area, and held the position of Mayor of Caernarvon for a time.


He will also be remembered as the author of ‘Anfeidrol Dduw Rhagluniaeth’, a popular Welsh harvest thanksgiving hymn.


He died in [[Caernarfon|Caernarvon]] in January 1904.

'''John Philoponus''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ɪ|ˈ|l|ɒ|p|ə|n|ə|s}}; {{lang|grc|Ἰωάννης ὁ Φιλόπονος}}; c. 490 – c. 570), also known as '''John the Grammarian''' or '''John of Alexandria''', was a Byzantine [[Alexandria]]n philologist, [[commentaries on Aristotle|Aristotelian commentator]] and Christian theologian, author of a considerable number of philosophical treatises and theological works. A rigorous, sometimes polemical writer and an original thinker who was controversial in his own time, John Philoponus broke from the Aristotelian–[[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] tradition, questioning methodology and eventually leading to empiricism in the natural sciences. He was one of the first to propose a "[[theory of impetus]]" similar to the modern concept of [[inertia]] over Aristotelian dynamics.

Later in life Philoponus turned to [[Christian apologetics]], arguing against the [[eternity of the world]], a theory which formed the basis of pagan attacks on the Christian doctrine of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]]. He also wrote on [[Christology]] and was posthumously condemned as a [[heresy|heretic]] by the [[State church of the Roman Empire|Imperial Church]] in 680–81 because of what was perceived as a tritheistic interpretation of the [[Trinity]].

His by-name {{lang|grc|ὁ Φιλόπονος}} translates as "lover of toil", i.e. "diligent," referring to a [[miaphysite]] confraternity in Alexandria, the ''philoponoi,'' who were active in debating pagan (i.e. Neoplatonic) philosophers.

His posthumous condemnation limited the spread of his writing, but copies of his work did circulate in Greek or Latin versions in medieval Europe, influencing [[Bonaventure]] and [[Buridan]]. His work was also received in Arabic scholarly tradition, where he is known as {{lang|ar-Latn|Yaḥyā al-Naḥwī}} (i.e. "John the Grammarian"). His critique of [[Aristotle]] in the [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'']] commentary was a major influence on [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] and [[Galileo Galilei]], who cited Philoponus substantially in his works.&lt;ref name="Mitrovic, B 2004 pp. 424-439"&gt;Branko Mitrović, "Leon Battista Alberti and the Homogeneity of Space", ''The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'', vol. 63, No. 4 (2004), pp. 424–439.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willam A. Wallace, ''Prelude to Galileo: Essays on Medieval and Sixteenth Century Sources of Galileo's Thought'' (Dordrecht, 1981), pp. 136, 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Although Philoponus' originating from a Christian family is possible, nothing is known of his early life. Philoponus studied at the school of [[Alexandria]] and began publishing from about 510. He was a pupil and sometime [[amanuensis]] to the Neoplatonic philosopher [[Ammonius Hermiae]], who had studied at Athens under [[Proclus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Philoponus' early writings are based on lectures given by Ammonius, but gradually he established his own independent thinking in his commentaries and critiques of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[On the Soul]]'' and ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''. In the latter work Philoponus became one of the earliest thinkers to reject Aristotle's dynamics and propose the "[[theory of impetus]]":&lt;ref&gt;Philoponus' term for impetus is "ἑνέργεια ἀσώματος κινητική" ("incorporeal motive ''[[Potentiality and actuality|enérgeia]]''"); see ''[[Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca|CAG]]'' XVII, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dVcqvVDiNVUC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Ioannis Philoponi in Aristotelis Physicorum Libros Quinque Posteriores Commentaria''], [[Walter de Gruyter]], 1888, p. 642: "λέγω δὴ ὅτι ἑνέργειά τις ἀσώματος κινητικὴ ἑνδίδοται ὑπὸ τοῦ ῥιπτοῦντος τῷ ῥιπτουμένῳ [I say that impetus (incorporeal motive energy) is transferred from the thrower to the thrown]."&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., an object moves and continues to move because of an energy imparted in it by the mover and ceases the movement when that energy is exhausted. This insightful theory was the first step towards the concept of [[inertia]] in modern physics, although Philoponus' theory was largely ignored at the time because he was too radical in his rejection of Aristotle.
{{quote|But this [view of Aristotle] is completely erroneous, and our view may be completely corroborated by actual observation more effectively than by any sort of verbal argument. For if you let fall from the same height two weights, one many times heavier than the other you will see that the ratio of the times required for the motion does not depend [solely] on the weights, but that the difference in time is very small. ... — John Philoponus' refutation of the Aristotelian claim that the elapsed time for a falling body is inversely proportional to its weight&lt;ref&gt;Morris R. Cohen and I. E. Drabkin (eds. 1958), ''A Source Book in Greek Science'' (p. 220), with several changes. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, as referenced by David C. Lindberg (1992), ''The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, 600 B.C. to A.D. 1450'', University of Chicago Press, p. 305, {{ISBN|0-226-48231-6}}
*Note the influence of Philoponus' statement on [[Galileo]]'s ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' (1638)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philoponus is the only writer of antiquity to have formally presented such a concept. 
As the discovery of the principle of inertia is the hallmark achievement of modern science as it emerges in the 16th to 17th centuries, [[Pierre Duhem]] argues that its invention would put Philoponus among the "great geniuses of Antiquity" and the "principal precursors to modern science", although he holds it more likely that Philoponus may have received the idea from an earlier, otherwise unrecorded [[Alexandrian school|Alexandrian]] school of mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Duhem, ''Le système du monde'', 1913, [https://archive.org/stream/lesystmedumond01duhe#page/398/mode/2up p. 398].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 529 Philoponus wrote his critique ''[[On the Eternity of the World Against Proclus]]'' in which he systematically defeats every argument put forward for the [[eternity of the world]], a theory which formed the basis of pagan attack of the Christian doctrine of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]]. The intellectual battle against eternalism became one of Philoponus' major preoccupations and dominated several of his publications (some now lost) over the following decade.

He introduced a new period of scientific thought based heavily on three premises: (1) The universe is a product of one single God, (2) the heavens and the earth have the same [[physical properties]], (3) and the stars are not divine.&lt;ref name="Lindberg1980"&gt;{{citation|author=David C. Lindberg|title=Science in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOCriv4rSCUC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=12 January 2013|date=15 March 1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48233-0|page=11ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these principles Philoponus went after his rival, [[Simplicius of Cilicia]], by questioning Aristotle's' view of dynamics and cosmology.&lt;ref name="Lindberg1980"/&gt; He argued that motion can occur in a void and that the velocity of a falling object is not based on its weight.&lt;ref name="Lindberg1980"/&gt; He also held that God created all matter with its physical properties and with natural laws that would allow matter to progress from a state of chaos to an organized state forming the present universe.&lt;ref name="Lindberg1980"/&gt; What remains of his writings indicate that he used the same [[didactic method]]s of reasoning that modern science uses and that he performed genuine experiments.&lt;ref name="Lindberg1980"/&gt;

The style of his commentaries and his conclusions made Philoponus unpopular with his colleagues and fellow philosophers, and he appears to have ceased his study of philosophy around 530, devoting himself to theology instead. Around 550 he wrote a theological work ''[[On the Creation of the World]]'' as a commentary on the [[Bible]]’s story of creation, using the insights of Greek philosophers and [[Basil the Great]]. In this work he transfers his theory of impetus to the motion of the planets, whereas Aristotle had proposed different explanations for the motion of heavenly bodies and for earthly projectiles. Thus Philoponus' theological work is recognized in the history of science as the first attempt at a unified theory of dynamics. Another of his major theological concerns was to argue that all material objects were brought into being by God (''Arbiter'', 52A–B).

Around 553 Philoponus made some theological contributions to the [[Second Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]] concerning [[Christology]]. His doctrine on Christ's duality, according to which in Christ remain two united substances, united but divided, is analogous to the union of the soul and body in human beings and coincides with the [[miaphysite]] school of thought. He also produced writings on the Trinity around this time. ''Arbiter'', John Philoponus' Christological “opus magnum” stands in the line with [[St. Cyril of Alexandria]] and [[Severus of Antioch]].&lt;ref name="Choniates, N 1997 pp. 540-548"/&gt; Philoponus asserted the understanding of Christ as divine and human, in opposition to [[Chalcedonian]] authors who strove to reach a middle ground.

==Legacy==
After his death, John Philoponus was declared to have held heretical views of the Trinity and was made [[anathema]] in 680–1. This limited the spread of his ideas in the following centuries, but in his own time and afterwards he was translated into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Arabic]], and many of his works survived and were studied by the Arabs. Some of his works continued to circulate in Europe in Greek or Latin versions and influenced [[Bonaventure]]. The theory of impetus was taken up by [[Buridan]] in the 14th century.

Philoponus and his contemporaries, [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] and [[Strato of Lampsacus|Strato]] developed the Aristotelian concept of space further, eventually influencing the [[Renaissance]] theory of perspective, particularly the one highlighted by [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and other architectural masters.&lt;ref name="Mitrovic, B 2004 pp. 424-439"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ed., ''Philoponus and the Rejection of Aristotelian Science'' (London, 1987), pp. 55ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
John Philoponus wrote at least 40 works on a wide array of subjects including grammar, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and theology.

===Philosophical commentaries===

The commentaries of the late antiquity and early Middle Ages aimed to teach an audience. In that regard, the repetitive nature of Philoponus’ commentaries demonstrates his pedagogical awareness. Although abstract in manner, Philoponus is chiefly focused on the concept in question.

Most of Philoponus’ early philosophical works strive to define the distinction between matter, extension, place, and various kinds of change. For example, the commentary ''[[On the Eternity of the World against Aristotle]]'' represents a standardized description of Aristotelian [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, C. , John Philoponus, ''On Aristotle’s One Coming to Be and Perishing 1.1-5 and 1.6-2.4''. (book review). Early Science and Medicine vol. 4 (2004),p. 424-439&lt;/ref&gt; Both Aristotle and Philoponus argue that in kinds of change there are differences, in their form and matter.

In ''Physics'', Aristotle operates with the idea of places, but dismisses the existence of space. The idea that came from Plato and was developed by Aristotle has been evolved by Philoponus. Philoponus attempts to combine the idea of homogeneous space with the Aristotelian system.&lt;ref name="Mitrovic, B 2004 pp. 424-439" /&gt; The argument made by Philoponus is that substances by themselves require some determinate quantity for their being. Similarly to Aristotle, who rejected the immaterial things, and in contrast to Plato who accepted immaterial substances in his metaphysics, Philoponus’ concept of substance refers to the material objects.

Concerning the discussion of space, Philoponus’ claim that from every point in space is possible to draw identical figures, made him be perceived as an innovative thinker who influenced later Renaissance scholars, for instance, [[Gianfranceso Pico della Mirandola]] and [[Galileo Galilei]]. Thus, Philoponus' idea of perspective signifies the concept of space as immaterial three-dimensional medium in which objects are located.&lt;ref name="Mitrovic, B 2004 pp. 424-439"/&gt;

In the third book of ''De Anima'', entitled ''De Intellectu'', Philoponus analyzes the doctrine of the intellect. The author (Philoponus or pseudo-Philoponus?) sets the theory on the role and functioning of the active intellect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0009-8388| volume = 42| issue = 2| pages = 510–522| last = Lautner| first = Peter| title = Philoponus, in De Anima III: Quest for an Author| journal = The Classical Quarterly| series = New Series| year = 1992| jstor = 639426| doi=10.1017/s0009838800016116}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, there is the active intellect, and on the other, the idea of perception awareness or how we are aware that we are perceiving. In other words, in this reflective philosophy, there is a rationalist conclusion which emphasizes a relation between self and truth which leads to the discussion of the nature of knowledge.

According to this view, the knowledge is identical to its object, since the self-awareness of perception is divorced from the irrational soul.Therefore, the understanding arises through the identification of the intellect and its object. More specifically, perception deals only with material things.&lt;ref&gt;Hubler, N. The Perils of Self-Perception: Explanations of Appreciation in the Greek Commentaries on Aristotle. ''The Review of Metaphysics'', vol. 59, Number 2, pp. 287–311&lt;/ref&gt;

Philoponus has raised the central question of the scientific and philosophical Aristotle’s work on chemistry. The work called ''On Generation and Corruption'' examines the question of how is the mixture (chemical combination) possible? Philoponus’ contribution to the topic is in his new definition of potential, the third of the seven elements criteria. There are various interpretations of the theory of mixture, but it seems that Philoponus is rather refining Aristotle’s approach than rejecting it. One of interpreters of Philophonus’ work on the theory of mixture, De Haas, implies that “no element can possess a quality essential to it except to a superlative extent”.&lt;ref&gt;De Haas, in Wood &amp; Weisberg, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, R. &amp; Weisberg, M. Interpreting Aristotle on mixture: problems about elemental composition from Philoponus to Cooper. Studies in History and Philosophy of Science, vol. 35 (2004), pp. 681–706&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological treatises===

Philoponus’ major Christological work is ''Arbiter''. The work was written shortly before the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] of 553.&lt;ref&gt;Translated and edited by A. Sandra in 1930&lt;/ref&gt; It became famous in regard to its doctrine on resurrection. Similarly to ideas presented in ''Physics'', Philoponus in the work titled ''Arbiter'' states that our corrupted bodies (material things) will be eventually brought into being (matter and form) by God.&lt;ref name="Choniates, N 1997 pp. 540-548"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0022-5185| volume = 48| issue = 2| pages = 540–548| last = Lang| first = U.

The '''Justice and Development Party''', JDP ({{lang-ar|حزب العدالة والتنمية}}; [[Berber language|Berber]]: ''A'''k'''abar en T'''n'''ezzarfut ed T'''n'''eflit'', '''KNN'''; {{lang-fr|Parti de la justice et du développement}}, '''PJD''') is the [[political party|party]] that has led the executive branch of the government of [[Morocco]] since 29 November 2011. The JDP (or PJD) advocates [[Islamism]] and [[Islamic democracy]].

==History==
PJD was founded by [[Abdelkrim al-Khatib]], one of the founders of the [[Popular Movement (Morocco)|Popular Movement]] party, from which he was expelled in the mid-1960s, under the name of ''MPDC'' ({{lang-fr|Mouvement populaire démocratique et constitutionnel}}, the "Popular Democratic and Constitutional Movement").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mohammed Hirchi|title=Political Islam in Morocco: The Case of the Party of Justice and Development (PJD)|journal=ACAS Bulletin|date=August 2007|issue=77|url=http://concernedafricascholars.org/bulletin/issue77/hirchi/|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was an empty shell for many years, until various members of a clandestine association [[Chabiba islamia]], who later formed the MUR ({{lang-fr|Mouvement unité et réforme}}, the "Unity and Reform Movement") joined the party, with the authorisation and encouragement of former [[Interior Minister]] [[Driss Basri]]. It later changed its name to current PJD in 1998.

The party won eight seats in the [[Moroccan parliamentary election, 1997|parliamentary election]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=tel11/&gt; In the [[Moroccan parliamentary election, 2002|parliamentary election]] held on 27 September 2002, the party won 42 out of 325 seats,&lt;ref name=tel11/&gt; winning most of the districts where it fielded candidates. Its secretary-general since 2004 was [[Saadeddine Othmani]], MP representing [[Mohammedia]]. In the [[Moroccan parliamentary election, 2007|parliamentary election]] held on 7 September 2007, the PJD won 43 out of 325 seats,&lt;ref name=fride&gt;{{cite web|author=Kristine Krausch|title=An Islamist Government in Morocco?|url=http://www.fride.org/download/BGR_GovMorocc_ENG_jul07.pdf|publisher=FRIDE|accessdate=10 October 2014|date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; behind the [[Istiqlal Party]], which won 52. This was contrary to expectations that the PJD would win the most seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moroccans favor conservative party instead of ushering in Islamic party|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/10/africa/AF-GEN-Morocco-Elections.php|newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=9 September 2007|agency=[[Associated Press]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014084028/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/10/africa/AF-GEN-Morocco-Elections.php|archivedate=14 October 2008 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the party had limited number of candidates in the election.&lt;ref name=fride/&gt;

[[Abdelilah Benkirane]] was elected leader of the PJD in July 2008, taking over from [[Saadeddine Othmani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abdelilah Benkirane élu à la tête du PJD|url=http://www.jeunesdumaroc.com/+6889-Abdelillah-Benkirane-elu-a-la-tete+.html|work=JDM Magazine|accessdate=25 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405233849/http://www.jeunesdumaroc.com/+6889-Abdelillah-Benkirane-elu-a-la-tete+.html|archivedate=5 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having won a plurality of seats (107 seats) in the November 2011 [[Moroccan parliamentary election, 2011|parliamentary election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morocco|url=http://www.europeanforum.net/country/morocco|publisher=European Forum|accessdate=10 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910053106/http://www.europeanforum.net/country/morocco|archivedate=10 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Perceptions in Morocco|url=https://www.ndi.org/files/Morocco-Youth-FG-Report-070212.pdf|publisher=National Democratic Institute for International Affairs|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the party formed a coalition with three parties that had been part of previous governments, and [[Abdelilah Benkirane]] was appointed Prime Minister of Morocco on 29 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/fr/20111126-pjd-concertations-partis-politique-maroc-abdelilah-benkirane-suffrages-legislatives Abdelilah Benkirane, dirigeant du Parti justice et développement, annoncé comme le vainqueur des législatives] ''France24''. 27 November 2011.

His new government has targeted average economic growth of 5.5 percent a year during its four-year mandate, and to reduce the jobless rate to 8 percent by the end of 2016 from 9.1 percent at the start of 2012.&lt;ref name="Reuters.com"/&gt; Benkirane's government has also actively pursued Morocco’s ties with the [[European Union]], its chief trade partner, as well as becoming increasingly engaged with the six-member [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Co-operation Council]].

==Ideology==
PJD is an Islamist conservative democrat party crucially supporting Moroccan monarchy. PJD disavows violence, terrorism and seeks to defend Morocco’s Islamic identity through legislative means. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Saadeddine Othmani]] is a moderate Muslim.&lt;ref name=tel11&gt;{{cite news|title=Islamists in Morocco election claim 'historic' vote breakthrough|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/morocco/8917595/Islamists-in-Morocco-election-claim-historic-vote-breakthrough.html|accessdate=10 October 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new |title=Islamic Party Confident in Morocco |last=Knickmeyer |first=Ellen |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/06/AR2007090602547.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=7 September 2007|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a paper published by the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], the PJD has placed economic and legal issues at the core of its platform and is committed to internal democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amr Hamzawy|title=Party for Justice and Development in Morocco: Participation and Its Discontents|date=July 2008|publisher=[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] |url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/?fa=view&amp;id=20314 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's stated platform includes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab Political Parties Database: Morocco: Justice and Development party|date=15 December 2007|work=[[United Nations Development Programme]]|url=http://www.arabparliaments.org/whatwedo/parties.aspx?cid=12&amp;pid=71|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khetlaji''' (खेतलाजी) is a folk deity of [[India]] who is primarily venerated in [[Rajasthan]]. His one of the shrine is located in village [[Sonana]] in [[Pali, Rajasthan|Pali]] district of [[Rajasthan]]. The temple is the site of a two-day fair, held every year during May-June in honor of Khetlaji. The fair attracts a large number of devotees who congregate here during the fair to invoke the blessing of the deity. There are many shrines of Khetlaji in [[Marwar]] area, like [[Sewari]], [[Sayala, Rajasthan|Sayala]] etc. [[Bhil Kataria|Kataria]] community of Rajasthan consider him as their Kul Devta.They also visit and perform some rituals after marriage and birth in the family which is called 'Juar'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6889">'''''Missa cantata''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "sung Mass") is a form of [[Tridentine Mass]] defined officially in 1960 as a sung Mass celebrated without sacred ministers, i.e., deacon and subdeacon.&lt;ref&gt;"''Missa in cantu'' ... si celebratur absque ministris sacris, vocatur ''Missa cantata'' ([http://www.ceremoniaire.net/print/pastorale1950/Rubriques-1960.pdf 1960 Code of Rubrics, 271]) - "A ''sung Mass'' ... when celebrated without sacred ministers, is called a ''Missa cantata''" ([http://www.maternalheart.org/library/1962rubrics.pdf translation by Rev. Patrick L. Murphy]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-1960 name ==

Documents of the Holy See such as the [https://archive.org/stream/romandocumentsde01cathuoft/romandocumentsde01cathuoft_djvu.txt Decree of the Congregation of Sacred Rites of 14 March 1906] spoke of ''Missa cantata sine Ministris'' (Sung/Chanted Mass without the Ministers). The 19th-century ''Ceremonial for the Use of the Catholic Churches in the United States of America'' (commonly called the "Baltimore Ceremonial" because published by request of the [[Third Plenary Council of Baltimore]] of 1884) used the name: '''High Mass without Deacon or Sub-Deacon'''&lt;ref&gt;''Baltimore Ceremonial'', page 67&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==

The ''Baltimore Ceremonial'' thus classified the ''Missa cantata'' as a High Mass. The early 20th-century ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' said, on the contrary, that a ''Missa cantata'' "is really a [[low Mass]], since the essence of high Mass is not the music but the deacon and subdeacon. Only in churches which have no ordained person except one priest, and in which high Mass is thus impossible, is it allowed to celebrate the Mass (on Sundays and feasts) with most of the adornment borrowed from high Mass, with singing and (generally) with incense."&lt;ref name=CathEnc&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09790b.htm [[Adrian Fortescue]], "Liturgy of the Mass" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York, 1910)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, [[Pope John XXIII]]'s [[Code of Rubrics]] distinguished the ''Missa cantata'' both from a high Mass and from low Mass. Under the number 271, it defined the forms of Mass as follows:
{{quote|Masses are of two kinds: ''sung Masses (in cantu)'' and ''low Masses (Missa lecta)'').

A Mass is called ''a sung Mass'', when the celebrant actually sings those parts which the rubrics require to be sung; otherwise it is called a ''low Mass''.

Moreover, a ''sung Mass'', when celebrated with the assistance of sacred ministers, is called a ''solemn or High Mass (Missa solemnis)''; when celebrated without sacred ministers, it is called a ''Missa cantata''.&lt;ref name=CoR&gt;Missarum species duae sunt: ''Missa in cantu'' et ''Missa lecta''. Missa dicitur ''in cantu'', si sacerdos celebrans partes ab ipso iuxta rubricas cantandas revera cantu profert: secus dicitur ''lecta''. ''Missa in cantu'' porro, si celebratur cum assistentia ministrorum sacrorum, appellatur ''Missa solemnis'': si celebratur absque ministris sacris, vocatur ''Missa cantata''" ([http://www.ceremoniaire.net/print/pastorale1950/Rubriques-1960.pdf original text in Latin]; [http://www.maternalheart.org/library/1962rubrics.pdf English translation by Rev. Patrick L. Murphy]).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Ceremonial ==

The ''Missa cantata'' came into use during the 18th century and was intended for use in non-Catholic countries where the services of a [[deacon]] or a [[subdeacon]] (or clergy to fill these parts in the ceremony of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]) were not easily had. It was intended to be used in place of [[Solemn Mass]] on Sundays and major feast days.

The use of incense at a ''Missa cantata'' was at first forbidden, but became general: "The Sacred Congregation of Rites has on several occasions (9 June 1884; 7 December 1888) forbidden the use of incense at a Missa Cantata; nevertheless, exceptions have been made for several dioceses, and the custom of using it is now generally tolerated."&lt;ref name=CathEnc/&gt; General permission was finally granted in the 1960 Code of Rubrics, which stated: "The incensations that are obligatory in Solemn Mass are permitted in every Missa Cantata".&lt;ref&gt;"Incensationes quae in Missa solemni fieri debent, fieri possunt etiam in omnibus Missis cantatis" ([http://www.ceremoniaire.net/print/pastorale1950/Rubriques-1960.pdf Code of Rubrics, 426)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The parts sung by the priest are to be sung in [[Gregorian chant]]. More elaborate musical settings of the choir's parts may also be used.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} 

== Current situation ==

The rigid distinction between a sung Mass and a low Mass in the [[Roman Rite]] was abandoned in the 1969 revision of the [[Roman Missal]]. The [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]] even states: "It is very appropriate that the priest sing those parts of the Eucharistic Prayer for which musical notation is provided."&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 147&lt;/ref&gt; Under the heading "The Importance of Singing", it says: "Great importance should therefore be attached to the use of singing in the celebration of the Mass, with due consideration for the culture of the people and abilities of each liturgical assembly. Although it is not always necessary (e.g., in weekday Masses) to sing all the texts that are of themselves meant to be sung, every care should be taken that singing by the ministers and the people is not absent in celebrations that occur on Sundays and on holy days of obligation."&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the 1962 Roman Missal, which incorporated the 1960 Code of Rubrics, remains permitted as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]].

'''Monastic silence''' is a spiritual practice recommended in a variety of religious traditions for purposes including facilitation of approaching deity, and achieving elevated states of spiritual purity.&lt;ref name="Holytrinitymonastery.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holytrinitymonastery.org/fr-benedict.html#Silence |title=Holy Trinity Monastery, a Benedictine Community in Southeastern Arizona, Chronicles |publisher=Holytrinitymonastery.org |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be in accordance with a monk's formal [[vow of silence]], but can also engage [[laity]] who have not taken vows, or novices who are preparing to take vows. Monastic silence is more highly developed in the Roman Catholic faith than in Protestantism, but it is not limited to Catholicism. The practice has a corresponding manifestation in the Orthodox church, which teaches that silence is a means to access the deity, to develop self-knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravmir.com/the-value-of-silence/ |title=The Value of Silence - A Russian Orthodox Church Website : A Russian Orthodox Church Website |publisher=Pravmir.com |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to live more harmoniously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/misc/allen_silence_that_screams.htm |title=Silence That Screams |publisher=Orthodoxresearchinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Theophilus, patriarch of Alexandria, placed the virtue of silence on par with the faith itself in a synodal letter from AD 400. "Monks—if they wish to be what they are called—will love silence and the Catholic faith, for nothing at all is more important than these two things." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brepols.metapress.com/content/g557085012jl7501/ |title=Brepols Publishers - Journal Article |publisher=Brepols.metapress.com |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice of silence by ordained and laity ==
The practice of silence is observed during different parts of the day; practitioners talk when they need to but maintain a sense of silence or a sense of prayer when talking. The rules of silence apply to both vowed practitioners and non-vowed guests.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Corrigan |first=Maureen |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/02/10/132708398/spare-and-sublime-a-monasterys-spell-of-silence#132737350 |title=Spare And Sublime: A Monastery's Spell Of 'Silence' |publisher=NPR |date=2011-02-10 |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious recommendations of silence as [[praxis (process)|praxis]] do not deprecate speech when it is thoughtful and considerate of commonly held values. According to Andrew March of the Benedictine order, we "can listen to substantive speech for hours while five minutes of garrulous speech is too much." It is noteworthy that "silence" can include what is more aptly characterized as "quietness", i.e. speaking in low voice tones.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Silence is not an absence of words or thoughts—it is a positive and substantive reality.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Christian contemplative traditions==

===Old Testament roots===
In the book ''Silence, The Still Small Voice of God'', Andrew March establishes the roots of silence doctrine in the [[Psalms]] attributed to David. 
"Benedict and his monastics would know from chanting the Psalter every week the verse that follows: “I was silent and still; I held my peace to no avail; my distress grew worse, my heart became hot within me. While I mused, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue” (Psalm 39: 3).

St. Norbet's Arts Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Trappist/english/ideas/silence.html |title=Trappist Monk : Ideas : Silence |publisher=Virtualmuseum.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; also anchors its views on silence in the Old Testament: "For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation." (Psalm 62)

=== Aids to practice ===
The Trappist rubric "Living in silence" illustrates centuries-old hand gestures which were "developed to convey basic communication of work and
spirit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Trappist/english/ideas/monasticism.html |title=Trappist monk : Ideas : Monasticism |publisher=Virtualmuseum.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benedictine===
Silence plays a salient role in the [[Benedictine rule]]. It is thought that by clearing the mind of distraction, one may listen more attentively to the deity.

Christian theology differs from Dharmic religions with regard to the mode in which spiritual ascent transpires within the context of contemplative quiet. Buddhism and Hinduism promote various spiritual practices, as do many Christian denominations. However, Christianity, particularly Protestantism, emphasizes the belief that ultimate spiritual achievement is not within the grasp of mortals, no matter how persistent their practice may be. Rather, the mechanism of spiritual attainment, which they regard as salvation and proximity to the deity, is believed to occur solely through supernatural mechanism. This mechanism is variously described as the action of God, conceived as the Father, or by action of the Holy Spirit. This mechanism of action, whether conceptualized as the Father or the Spirit, is called ''grace''.

In contemplative practice, the role of silence is expressed by the Fr. David Bird, OSB, (Order of St. Benedict): "When both our interior and exterior are quiet, God will do the rest."

===Cistercian===
Cistercian monastics have remained active in the promotion of contemplative [[Christian meditation|meditation]].&lt;ref name="Cistercian.org.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cistercian.org.au/pages/monastic-silence.php |title=Tarrawarra Abbey - Monastic Silence |publisher=Cistercian.org.au |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the emphasis is on achieving spiritual ascent, but monastic silence also functions to avoid sin.&lt;ref name="Cistercian.org.au"/&gt;

Although speech is morally neutral ''per se'', the Epistle of James (3:1-12) and writers of the monastic tradition see silence as the only effective means of neutralizing our tendency towards sins of the tongue.&lt;ref name="Cistercian.org.au"/&gt; There is an ongoing dialogue between Benedictine and Cistercian which speaks of a "monastic archetype" characterized by peace and silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Monastic Dialogue |url=http://monasticdialog.com/a.php?id=21 |title=Dialogue between Christian and Non-Christian Monks, Opportunities and Difficulties |last=Rossano |first=Pietro |volume=Bulletin 10  |date=February 1981 |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trappist===
A Trappist’s commitment to silence is a monastic value which assures solitude in community. It fosters mindfulness of God and fraternal communion. It opens the mind to the inspirations of the Holy Spirit and favours attentiveness of the heart and solitary prayer to God. Early monastic communities evolved [[Monastic sign languages|simple hand signing]] for essential communications. Spoken conversations between monks are permitted, but limited according to the norms established by the community and approved by the Order.

{{quote|"Silence is the mystery of the world to come. Speech is the organ of this present world. More than all things love silence: it brings you a fruit that the tongue cannot describe. In the beginning we have to force ourselves to be silent. But then from our very silence is born something that draws us into deeper silence. May God give you an experience of this 'something' that is born of silence. If you practice this, inexpressible light will dawn upon you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Trappist/english/ideas/silence.html |work=A Day in the Life of a Trappist Monk |title=Silence |publisher=Virtualmuseum.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=Issac of Ninive|http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Trappist/english/ideas/silence.html}}

===Protestantism===
[[Baptist]] pastor and evangelist [[Frederick Brotherton Meyer]] (1847–1929), a member of the [[Higher Life movement]], developed a strong commitment to silence, which he saw as one of the ways to gain access to God's guidance on all matters.
{{quote|"We must be still before God. The life around us, in this age, is pre eminently one of rush and effort. It is the age of the express train and electric telegraph. Years are crowded into months, and weeks into days. This feverish haste threatens the religious life. The stream has already entered our churches, and stirred their quiet pools. Meetings crowd on meetings. The same energetic souls are found at them all, and engaged in many good works beside. But we must beware that we do not substitute the active for the contemplative, the valley for the mountain top. (...) We must make time to be alone with God.

FB Meyer exerted a deep influence on [[Frank Buchman]] (1878–1961), originally a Protestant evangelist who founded the Oxford Group (known as Moral Re-Armament from 1938 until 2001, and as [[Initiatives of Change]] since then). Foundational to Buchman's spirituality was the practice of a daily "quiet time" during which, he claimed, anyone could search for, and receive, divine guidance on every aspect of their life. Dr Karl Wick, editor of the Swiss Catholic daily ''Vaterland'', wrote that Buchman had "brought silence out of the monastery into the home, the marketplace and the board room."&lt;ref&gt;Article in Silva, 25 March 1962, quoted by Garth Lean, Frank Buchman, A Life, published by Collins, 1985, p.532, {{ISBN|978-0006272403}}, [http://www.frankbuchman.info/]&lt;/ref&gt; Buchman, in turn, taught thousands to "listen and obey", finding amazing resonance with non-Christian as well as Christian religions.&lt;ref&gt;See a panorama of Buchman's work on [[Initiatives of Change]] website [http://www.iofc.org/history]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist tradition==
[[Buddhist meditation]] techniques make use of ''[[vipassana]]'' and ''[[samatha]]'' techniques in their meditation practice. One of the central categories of Buddhist thought is ''[[sunyata]]'', which can be characterized as the silence of ontological Being. Neither the [[Bodhisattva vows]] of Mahayana Buddhism nor Theravada typically involve any vows of silence. Vowed religious practitioners do not typically practice silence pursuant to their vows, but rather as a local or "denominational" rule of monastic life.

===Zen practice of silence===
The Zen monastery is called the ''zen-dō'', and a primary practice is sitting meditation called ''[[zazen]]''. Zazen is practiced either in silence, or by chanting. Apart from sitting practice, silence is frequently customary during simple vegetarian rice-gruel meals.&lt;ref name="adhood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zendo.co.tv |title=adhood |publisher=Zendo.co.tv |date= |accessdate=2012-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619213851/http://zendo.co.tv/ |archivedate=June 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Codified hand and arm gestures are used to communicate.&lt;ref name="adhood"/&gt; Silence is generally preceded by a recitation of the [[Heart sutra]] and the [[five meditations]].&lt;ref name="adhood"/&gt;

=== Depiction of silence in parable===
Various stories or parables depict silence in meditation and action, in both vowed and lay practice.

:Three monks who had taken vows of silence were permitted an annual reprieve during which one monk was permitted to speak at the end of each year of silence. At the end of the first year, the first monk was allowed his opportunity to speak, whereupon he said "The soup is too hot." Another year elapsed, and it was the next monk's turn. The monks turned their attention to him, whereupon he said "The soup is too cold." Another year elapsed; it was the third monk's turn. The assembled monks turned to him, whereupon he said "The soup is neither too cold nor too hot. However, it is too salty." By the fourth year, the Abbess had posted a notice that it would be she who would speak at the end of that year. The assembled monks were particularly alert to hear the esteemed Abbess give her speech. One could hear the sound of a butterfly's wings in the silence which enveloped the hall. Whereupon the Abess said "There will be no more of this quibbling about the soup." Thus have I heard.&lt;ref&gt;Wisdom from Mom: A American Dharma, D. Virmalakirti, Dharma Bum IMC CCL.3 Press, Austin, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

:Four monks decided to meditate silently without speaking for two weeks. By nightfall on the first day, the candle began to flicker and then went out. The first monk said, "Oh, no! The candle is out." The second monk said, "Aren't we not supposed to talk?" The third monk said, "Why must you two break the silence?" The fourth monk laughed and said, "Ha! I'm the only one who didn't speak."&lt;ref name="detoxifynow1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detoxifynow.com/zen_parables.html |title=Sufi and Zen parables |publisher=Detoxifynow.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silence practice in Judaism==
Judaism has a tradition of silence in sacred space and in sacred structures. Although technically not classified as monasteries, synagogues, yeshivas, and ''beit midrash'' (house of study) are the models, along with the [[Tanakh]] (Bible), upon which the monastic silence tradition are built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Amy |last=Hirshberg Lederman|title= Finding meaning in the sound of silence|work= Arizona Jewish Post|date= 23 December 2010 |url=http://azjewishpost.com/2010/finding-meaning-in-the-sound-of-silence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Shmuel Afek starts [[minyan]] with five minutes of silence during which each person can engage in his or her own personal preparation for [[tefillah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heschel.org/page.cfm?p=266 |title=Abraham Joshua Heschel School: Tefillah |publisher=Heschel.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isadore Twersky]] states in Introduction to the Code of Maimonides: "One must be attuned to the silences".&lt;ref&gt;Isadore Twersky, Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah) (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1980), p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merton: bridging contemplative traditions==
[[File:Thanksgiving chapel interior.jpg|thumb|Thanks-Giving Square chapel interior in Dallas, Texas]]

One of the leading exponents of monastic [[contemplative|contemplative awareness]] is [[Thomas Merton]]. 

===From Thoughts in Solitude (1956)===
According to Merton, silence represents a form of transcending [[koan|paradoxes]] such as he may have encountered in [[zazen]] training.

{{quote|"Contradictions have always existed in the soul of [individuals]. But it is only when we prefer analysis to silence that they become a constant and insoluble problem. We are not meant to resolve all contradictions but to live with them and rise above them and see them in the light of exterior and objective values which make them trivial by comparison."|Thomas Merton|Thoughts in Solitude{{Page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

=== The Asian Journal===
{{quote|"I am able to approach the Buddhas barefoot and undisturbed, my feet in wet grass, wet sand. Then the silence of the extraordinary faces. The great smiles. Huge and yet subtle. Filled with every possibility, questioning nothing, knowing everything, rejecting nothing, the peace not of emotional resignation but of Madhyamika, of sunyata, that has seen through every question without trying to discredit anyone or anything — without refutation — without establishing some other argument. For the doctrinaire, the mind that needs well-established positions, such peace, such silence, can be frightening."|Thomas Merton|The Asian Journal{{Page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

===Monastic life===
{{quote|"The chief function of monastic silence is then to preserve that ''memoria Dei'' which is much more than just 'memory'. It is a total consciousness and awareness of God which is impossible without silence, recollection, solitude and a certain withdrawal."|Thomas Merton|Monastic Life{{Page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

=== Contemplative silence as protest ===
In addition to being a major figure in the field of contemplative studies, Merton expressed awareness of social issues conscience.

{{quote|"I make monastic silence a protest against the lies of politicians, propagandists and agitators..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodhealth.com/articles/2009/09/23/monastic_silence_being_instead_of_doing |title=Monastic Silence: Being instead of Doing - Good Health by Seton |publisher=Goodhealth.com |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==East-West concurrence on role of silent practice==
Monastic silence is a category of practice which unites faiths&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1390538 | pages=187–190|title=Word and Silence in Buddhist and Christian Traditions|first1=Donald|last1=Mitchell|volume=19|date=1999|journal=Buddhist-Christian Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributes a perennial topic of convergence between eastern and western traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/theology/cathbudd.htm |title=Second Buddhist-Christian Colloquium |publisher=Ewtn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Keating|Father Thomas Keating]] is the founder of Contemplative Outreach and former abbot of St. Benedict's Monastery in Snowmass, Colorado.&lt;ref name="contout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_people_keating |title=Father Thomas Keating |publisher=Contemplative Outreach |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that "as in Buddhism, Christianity has several contemplative methods. The methods of contemplative prayer are expressed in two traditions: centering prayer, which we represent, and Christian Meditation, designed by John Main, which is now spreading rapidly throughout the world under the charismatic leadership of Father Lawrence Freeman."{{cite quote|date=January 2012}}

Keating's approach is more directly influenced by his collaboration with Buddhists from various traditions, whereas Main is influenced by his travels among Indian Hindus.&lt;ref name="contout" /&gt; Keating states that one "progresses eventually to Christ nature or Buddha nature"&lt;ref name="Monastic Dialogue"&gt;{{cite web|author=Monastic Dialogue |url=http://www.monasticdialog.com/a.php?id=57 |title=Monastic Interreligious Dialogue &amp;#124; Fifth Buddhist-Christian Meditation Conference at Naropa |publisher=Monasticdialog.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keating distinguishes his contemplative method from that of John Main, another teacher of Christian mindfulness, but states an affinity for "interior silence". "The John Main approach is a little different than ours, but both go in the same direction: moving beyond dependence on concepts and words to a direct encounter with God on the level of faith and interior silence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingrosaries.org |accessdate=January 7, 2014 |title=Rosaries for the Contemplative Dimension of Prayer|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522081431/http://www.livingrosaries.org/ |archivedate=May 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr. James Conner, OCSO wrote about the Fifth Christian–Buddhist Contemplative Conference held at the Naropa Institute in which ordained practitioners from Zen, Vajrayana, and Catholic monastic lineages conducted meditation and discussion. According to Conner, wordless prayer is designed to transcend rational processes to allow perception of an exalted state. "Zen says that Buddha-nature begins where the rational level ends. The same is taught in Christianity. One is to practice thoughtless, wordless prayer and thus perceive the divine presence."&lt;ref name="Monastic Dialogue"/&gt;

===Silence motif injected into cross-cultural adaptation===
Silence is interjected into this Christian parable in some circles.{{By whom|date=January 2012}}

:One of master Gasan's monks visited the university in Tokyo. When he returned, he asked the master if he had ever read the Christian Bible. "No," Gasan replied, "Please read some of it to me." The monk opened the Bible to the Sermon on the Mount in St. Matthew, and began reading. After reading Christ's words about the lilies in the field, he paused. Master Gasan was silent for a long time.&lt;ref name="detoxifynow1"/&gt; "Yes," he finally said, "Whoever uttered these words is an enlightened being. What you have read to me is the essence of everything I have been trying to teach you here!"

The original rendering of this syncope or parable from the Gospel of Luke does not incorporate silence. The adaptation into Zen tradition could have omitted the role of silence. This particular use of silence is neither monastic nor vowed, but the dialogue may well have taken place in a monastery rather than a university.{{Synthesis-inline|date=January 2012}}

Buddhism and Christianity are not the only traditions enunciating the virtues of quietism. The [[Tao Te Ching]] enunciates a view of the supreme value of doing absolutely nothing, in a profound metaphysical sense. This is called [[wu wei]] and is consistent with the concept of [[sunyata]] more fully elaborated in Buddhism.{{Synthesis-inline|date=January 2012}} According to the Tao Te Ching, silence is merely the application of this concept to the tongue in addition to hands and feet.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Application of monastic silence practice outside of religious context==

The spiritual practice of silence has been extended into the healthcare setting under the rubric of Mind-Body healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodhealth.com/articles/2009/09/23/monastic_silence_being_instead_of_doing |title=Monastic Silence: Being instead of Doing |last=Speier |first=Patricia |publisher=Goodhealth.com |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Jack Engler of the Theravada tradition of Buddhism is Director of the Schiff Psychiatric Center at Harvard University and participates in Christian–Buddhist dialogue. Dr Engller lived as a novice at the Abbey of Gethsemane, which is affiliated with Merton, and studied Buddhist meditation practices in Burma and India.&lt;ref name="Monastic Dialogue"/&gt;

In the series, Nakoruru is a gentle and shy teenage girl serving [[Mother Nature]] as a [[shamanic]] priestess of the [[Ainu mythology|Ainu religion]], born on [[Hokkaido]] island in 1771. Despite her usually pacifistic ways, she became a [[Kamui]] warrior of her peaceful Kamuikotan village after the death of her idolized father,&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmuseum.com/end/neogeo/a/ssznak.htm |title=Ending for Samurai Spirits Zero-Nakoruru(Neo Geo) |publisher=Vgmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to fulfill this role throughout the series, fighting evil, often alongside [[Haohmaru]], and even assuming a human form after her death (when she sacrifices herself to restore the balance of nature and preserve the land for her people at the end of the second game).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmuseum.com/end/neogeo/a/samur2nako.htm |title=Ending for Samurai Shodown 2-Nakoruru(Neo Geo) |publisher=Vgmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, she merges her soul with [[Gaia]] and becomes "the holy spirit who wanders through time" in a form that resembles a [[koro-pok-guru]].

To prevent a looming disaster, Nakoruru traveled to the present and teamed up with Mui Mui and Love Heart to enter the tournament to find Verse. Nakoruru, along with Team Japan (led by [[Kyo Kusanagi]]) and Team Official Invitation, manage to beat Verse. After that, she and her team have fun visiting Hokkaido and China.

==Design and gameplay==
[[File:Purple Nakoruru.png|thumb|250px|Both forms of Nakoruru appearing as separate characters in the 1999 anime film ''Samurai Spirits 2: Asura Zanmaden''|left]]The idea for the character came from a modern Japanese perception of the [[indigenous people|indigenous]] [[Ainu people]] of Hokkaido, being depicted as revering nature and peacefully coexisting with it. Her costume's design was based on Ainu clothing and she was supposed to mix a concept of a "petite girl with a lovely appearance and personality" with an "innovative" character performance of commanding a hawk companion in battle.&lt;ref name=whats&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neogeomuseum.snkplaymore.co.jp/whats/ |title=What'S "Neogeo"? &amp;#124; Neogeo Museum |publisher=Neogeomuseum.snkplaymore.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-10-06|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Nakoruru was not directly modeled after any particular existing character, Hilda from ''[[The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun]]'' and Kamui from ''[[The Dagger of Kamui]]'' helped her conception process. The girl that appears during Nakoruru's entrances in ''Capcom vs. SNK'' is one of her childhood friends introduced in ''Nakoruru: Ano Hito kara no Okurimono'', Manari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/samuraishodown/samuraishodown8.htm |title=Samurai Shodown |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date= |accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nakoruru was notably the first fighting game character brought back to life following her demise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9116190 |title=Retronauts: 1UP's Classic Gaming Blog : Back to Life |publisher=1up.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the first who used a sidekick character in gameplay.&lt;ref name=rg/&gt;

Nakoruru is 153&amp;nbsp;cm tall.&lt;ref name="ko14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snkplaymore.co.jp/us/games/kof-xiv/characters/nakoruru.php |title=THE KING OF FIGHTERS XIV &amp;#124; PlayStation®4 |publisher=Snk Playmore |date= |accessdate=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate, [[palette swap]] version of her with tanned skin and different colors of hair and eyes is the '''Bust Nakoruru''' (''Rasetsu Nakoruru'') or '''EX Nakoruru,''' a recurring [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] type character that eventually evolved into Rera. Popularly known as {{nihongo|'''Purple Nakoruru'''|紫ナコルル|Murasaki Nakoruru}}, she is a crueler and cockier version of Nakoruru, more violent about fulfilling her mission to protect nature, and her companion is Shikuru the wolf. In [[fan service]] oriented fighting game ''SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy'', Nakoruru appears as default in a "sexy vampire" costume with a bat as her animal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/201801290015/|title=ヴァンパイアコスチュームのナコルルが登場！PS4/Nintendo Switch「SNKヒロインズ Tag Team Frenzy」最新トレーラーが公開｜Gamer|last=Gamer|website=www.gamer.ne.jp|language=ja|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/219905/20180130/samurai-shodown-s-nakoruru-makes-appeareance-in-snk-heroines-tag-team-frenzy-trailer.htm|title=Samurai Shodown’s Nakoruru Makes Appeareance In SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy Trailer|last=Cannon|first=William|date=2018-01-30|work=Tech Times|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in ''The King of Fighters XIV'' she can be dressed up in a modern schoolgirl uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/news/201701/27125686.html|title=『ザ・キング・オブ・ファイターズ XIV』ナコルルの女子校制服とシュンエイの修行道着が配信開始 - ファミ通.com|website=ファミ通.com|language=ja|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To compensate for Nakoruru's short weapon range, players must rely on her speed to punish their opponents' mistakes. Nakoruru's strengths lie in her air supremacy (including aerial throws) and ability to jump around the sides of the screen.&lt;ref&gt;''MAXIMUM The Video Game Magazine'' issue 3 (January 1996) pages 50-52.&lt;/ref&gt; She can also recover from her moves a little quicker than other characters, making it easier for her to hit-and-run during fights. To balance her out with the rest of the cast, her attack strength is slightly weaker than most fighters. Her move set usually incorporates slightly longer ranged attacks that project her or her animal companions to her foes so her attack range is not limited to her sword. Since ''Samurai Shodown II'', she can also reflect projectiles with the move "Kamui Ryusei".&lt;ref&gt;''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' issue 66 (January 1995) page 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Mamahaha can be used by the player to attack opponents in a diagonal aerial attack, acting as Nakoruru's projectile and anti-air defense. The player may also command Nakoruru to use him as a mount for a limited time. Whilst she is in the air, players can command the pair to hover higher, drop, or use Nakoruru to attack foes; she may do so normally from Mamahaha's height or players may choose to drop her in a swirl attacking motion or use a diagonal nosedive attack. Her moves' names are written in the [[Ainu language]]. 

Prior to ''Samurai Shodown V Special'', Nakoruru and Rimururu have been the series' two characters notable for being immune to the [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatality]]-like bloody killing moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Tips_Tricks_Volume_IV_Issue_3_1997-03_LFP_US/Tips__Tricks_Volume_IV_Issue_3_1997-03_LFP_US#page/n13/mode/2up/ |title=Tips &amp; Tricks - Volume IV Issue 3 (1997-03)(LFP)(US) |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=小暮ひさのり |url=http://www.kotaku.jp/2013/07/samurai_spirits.html |title=おこなの？ 激おこなの？ あの『真SAMURAI SPIRITS』がスマホに移植！ ｜ コタク・ジャパン |publisher=Kotaku.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-10-06|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/review/1119507.html|title=【名作発掘】「アケアカNEOGEO サムライスピリッツ 天草降臨」レビュー シリーズ屈指の異色作「サムスピ 天草降臨」を怒り爆発でプレイ!!  アケアカNEOGEO サムライスピリッツ 天草降臨|last=|first=|date=2018-04-27|work=GAME Watch|access-date=2018-07-29|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Samurai Shodown: Edge of Destiny'', Mamahaha does not appear in fights except in special moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worthplaying.com/article/2010/4/24/reviews/73862/ |title=Xbox 360 Review - 'Samurai Shodown Sen' |publisher=Worthplaying |date= |accessdate=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of monkeys in Nakoruru's stage in the original ''Samurai Shodown'' was a mistake of the background designer Tomoki Fukui which confused many fans as there are no monkeys on Hokkaido.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/10/15223966/the-making-of-samurai-shodown|title=The making of Samurai Shodown|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rera==
[[File:Rera SS.png|thumb|Rera with Shikuru the wolf in ''[[Samurai Shodown VI]]''|alt=]]

{{nihongo|Rera|レラ|Rera}} (meaning "Wind" in Ainu) is a player character introduced in 2003. Her mannerism was based on Nakoruru's "Bust" form, being a violent and haughty ego of hers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=SNK Playmore | title=Samurai Spirits V Creators Commentary | url=http://www.samurai-zero.jp/coment.html | work=Web Archive from Samurai Shodown V page | accessdate=January 1, 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031207052700/http://www.samurai-zero.jp/coment.html | archivedate=December 7, 2003 | language=Japanese | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruthless Nakoruru suppresses this side of herself as Rera sees "eliminating everyone who stands in her way" as a necessity to protect nature. Rera can physically take over Nakoruru, but has only done so when Nakoruru is reluctant to kill her enemies, and even manifest as a separate material entity to protect her host. Rera eventually merges back with Nakoruru after she realizes that fighting does not solve everything and peaceful solutions can be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmuseum.com/end/neogeo/a/sszrer.htm |title=Ending for Samurai Spirits Zero-Rera(Neo Geo) |publisher=Vgmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rera is playable in ''Samurai Shodown V'' and ''VI''. Similar to Nakoruru's "Bust" form in ''Samurai Shodown III'' and ''IV'', she too wields a kodachi and fights alongside her wolf, Shikuru, which primarily serves as a mount for her mount and is a necessity for several her special moves. Whilst Rera mounts him, the player can run faster and jump longer distances at the sacrifice of a lower height. She also appears in ''Days of Memories'' and in the film ''Nakoruru: Ano Hito kara no Okurimono''.

| quote = Despite her petite frame and gentle disposition, Nakoruru is, in our minds, one of the first "agile but weaker" fighting game characters to truly distinguish herself from her male counterparts. We love the fact that she’s essentially two characters in one, given her companionship with her trusty hawk Mamahaha or the lesser-seen wolf Shikuru (which later spawned the creation of Nakoruru’s evil other half, Rera). Nakoruru is one of SNK’s crowning achievements in character design: a memorable female fighter whose popularity doesn’t lie solely in sex appeal.&lt;ref name=gr/&gt;

In the West, ''[[GamePro]]'' reviewers criticized the original ''Samurai Shodown'' for its perceived unbalancing of characters, singling out Nakoruru as "too weak",&lt;ref&gt;''GamePro'' issue 051 (October 1993) page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; but ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' conversely opined that "despite her size, Nakoruru is one of the deadlier fighters" in the game.&lt;ref&gt;''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' issue 50 (September 1993) page 167.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hobby Consolas]]'' described this "no doubt" favourite ''Samurai Shodown'' female character as an equivalent of [[Mai Shiranui]] from ''Fatal Fury'' but with a different appeal, that is an irresistible cuteness instead of sexual provocativeness.&lt;ref name=hc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/HobbyConsolas055/Hobby_Consolas_055#page/n111/mode/2up/ |title=Hobby Consolas 055 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since been included among the series' favourites of many gaming publications, including [[Anime News Network]], [[GamesRadar]], [[IGN]], [[Joystiq]], ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' and VideoGamer.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-mike-toole-show/2015-05-03/.87784 |title=SNK-Hole - The Mike Toole Show |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2015-05-03 |accessdate=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/comicfighting-game-mashups-that-need-to-happen/?page=2 |title=Page 2 - Comic/fighting-game mashups that need to happen |publisher=GamesRadar |date=2008-11-26 |accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2000/11/13/capcom-vs-snk-millennium-fight-2000 |title=Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 - IGN |publisher=Uk.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/06/08/hands-on-samurai-shodown-edge-of-destiny/ |title=Hands-on: Samurai Shodown: Edge of Destiny |publisher=Engadget.com |date=2009-06-08 |accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/OXM_2006_02-web#page/n31/mode/1up/ |title=Official Xbox Magazine Issue 54 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orry |first=James |url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/samurai_showdown_sen/news/samurai_showdown_sen_given_pal_release.html |title=Samurai Showdown Sen given PAL release - Samurai Showdown Sen for Xbox 360 News |publisher=Videogamer.com |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, GamesRadar listed Nakoruru among top seven fighting game characters of all time, comparing her to a "[[feudal Japan]] version of [[Captain Planet]]".&lt;ref name=gr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/top-7-best-fighting-game-characters/ |title=The Top 7… Best fighting game characters |publisher=GamesRadar |date=2012-09-10 |accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3099">The '''Parahiya'''  are a [[Hindu]] [[Caste system in India|caste]] found in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in India.

==Origin==
The name ''Parahiya'' is said to mean in the [[Gondi language]] ''the burners of the forest'' because they practice [[slash and burn]] agriculture. According to other traditions, the name is corruption of the word ''Paharia'', which in [[Hindi]] means a hill dweller. They are one of a number of tribal communities such as the [[Panika]] that occupy the foothills of the [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya]] mountains. The community speak a dialect of Hindi.&lt;ref name="poi"&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 1120 to 1124 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==
The habitat of most of the Parhiya is the hilly, undulating and extremely forested southern part of [[Sonbhadra district]], at the foot of the Vindhya mountains. They are [[endogamy|endogamous]] and divided into a number of [[exogamy|exogamous]] clans known as kuris, of which the main ones are the Bengeha, Bhaloa, Bhania, Bhusan, Gohawa, Gurgur, Monnoor and Sira. Although they are Hindu, they also have a number of their own tribal deities such as Jawalamukhi Devi and Dharti Mata.&lt;ref name="poi" /&gt;

The Parahiya depend on the forest for their subsistence. They are small landholding community. Hunting and gathering forest produce is an important source of their income. They collect roots, tubers, fruits, lacs and leaves, which they sell at the local market. They no longer engage in hunting as settled cultivation is now their occupation.&lt;ref name="poi" /&gt;

The [[Government of Uttar Pradesh]] had classified them as a [[Scheduled Caste]] but by 2007, they were one of several groups that it had redesignated as [[Scheduled Tribes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=State At A Glance - Uttar Pradesh |date=July 2007 |journal=Pratiyogita Darpan |volume=2 |issue=13 |page=81|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7egDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT72}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, this designation applies only in [[Sonbhadra district]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tribal.nic.in/WriteReadData/CMS/Documents/201212010356439267578File1068.pdf |title=State wise Scheduled Tribes&amp;nbsp;— Uttar Pradesh |publisher=Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India |accessdate=2017-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123041643/http://tribal.nic.in/WriteReadData/CMS/Documents/201212010356439267578File1068.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as it also did at the time of the [[2011 Census of India]] when the Parahiya Scheduled Caste population in Uttar Pradesh was 2446.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/SC_ST/PCA-A10/SC-0900-PCA-A-10-ddw.xlsx |title= A-10 Individual Scheduled Caste Primary Census Abstract Data and its Appendix - Uttar Pradesh |publisher=Registrar General &amp; Census Commissioner, India |accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Failing [[UHF]] TV station KRUD, Channel 17, is "reborn" as Christian television station KGOD.  The new format is a big success but attracts an incompatible mix of fringe ministries and broadcasters wanting time on the station.  A series of humorous vignettes show the different religious shows the station broadcasts: a [[faith healer]], a radical [[black nationalist]] preacher, a preacher with a drive-in church, a Christian [[game show]], etc.

The film is very similar in both plot and style to the 1989 film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reelfilm.com/mgmcult.htm David Nusair, "Six Comedy Cult Classics from MGM", reelfilm.com, November 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/18817/pray-tv/ Scott Weinberg, "Pray TV", DVD Talk, November 15, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''Pray TV'' stars [[Dabney Coleman]], Paul Cooper, Rosemary Alexander, and [[Lewis Arquette]], with cameos by [[Paul Reubens]] and the band [[Devo]] (who play a [[Christian rock]] band named "Dove").  It was directed by Rick Friedberg.

==Release==
''Pray TV'' was picked up by [[Filmways Pictures]] in 1980 (under its original name, ''KGOD'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iasqAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=KGOD&amp;dq=KGOD&amp;hl=en|title=Acquisitions (p. 26); No title available (p. 41)|year=1980|accessdate=November 14, 2011|work=Film Bulletin|publisher=Wax Publications|volume=49|page=26, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film premiered on television instead of theatrically,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RacqQu0B3IC&amp;q=KGOD+-+%22Pray+TV%22&amp;dq=KGOD+-+%22Pray+TV%22&amp;hl=en|title=VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever 1997|chapter=Pray TV|page=xiii|isbn=0-7876-0780-0|year=1996|accessdate=November 14, 2011|publisher=Visible Ink Press/[[Gale (publisher)|Gale/Cengage Learning]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aired on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] in 1983 under its present title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y8dFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4-cMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=pray-tv%20coleman&amp;pg=5761%2C2318983 |title=Television movies|date=March 18, 1983|accessdate=November 14, 2011|work=[[The Telegraph-Herald]]|page=19 (Entertainment Section)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect-distinguish|Votary|Notary}}
'''Religious vows''' are the public [[vows]] made by the members of religious communities pertaining to their conduct, practices, and views. 

In the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition, in particular within the [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] tradition, many different kinds of religious vows are taken by the lay community as well as by the monastic community, as they progress along the path of their practice. In the monastic tradition of all schools of Buddhism the [[Vinaya]] expounds the vows of the fully ordained Nuns and Monks. 

In the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition, such public vows are made by the religious – [[Cenobium|cenobitic]] and [[Hermit|eremitic]] – of the Catholic Church, Anglican Communion, and Eastern Orthodox Churches, whereby they confirm their public profession of the [[Evangelical Counsels]] of poverty, chastity, and obedience or [[Rule of St Benedict|Benedictine]] equivalent. The vows are regarded as the individual's free response to a call by God to follow [[Jesus Christ]] more closely under the action of the [[Holy Spirit]] in a particular form of [[Christian monasticism|religious living]]. A person who lives a religious life according to vows they have made is called a ''votary'' or a ''votarist''. The religious vow, being a public vow, is binding in [[Church law]]. One of its effects is that the person making it ceases to be free to marry. In the Catholic Church, by joining the consecrated life, one does not become a member of the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|hierarchy]] but becomes a member of a state of life which is neither [[Catholic Church hierarchy#The Clergy|clerical]] nor [[Catholic Church hierarchy#Laity|lay]], the consecrated state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1X.HTM 1983 Code of Canon Law, Canon 588]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the members of the religious orders and those hermits who are in [[Holy Orders]] are members of the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://uk.geocities.com/deo_auxiliante%40btinternet.com/churchchart.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+04:14:48  Chart showing the place of those making religious vows among the People of God]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== In the Western Church ==
Since the 6th century, [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s following the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] have been making the so-called Benedictine vow at their public [[Profession (religious)#Religious profession|profession]] of obedience (placing oneself under the direction of the abbot/abbess or prior/prioress), stability (committing oneself to a particular monastery), and "conversion of manners" (which includes forgoing private ownership and celibate chastity).&lt;ref&gt;Rule of St Benedict, ch. 58:17.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 12th and 13th centuries [[mendicant orders]] emerged, such as the [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], whose vocation emphasizing mobility and flexibility required them to drop the concept of "stability". They therefore [[Profession (religious)#Religious profession|profess]] ''chastity, poverty and obedience'', like the members of many other orders and religious congregations founded subsequently. The public [[Profession (religious)#Religious profession|profession]] of these so-called [[Evangelical counsels]] (or [[counsels of perfection]]), confirmed by vow or other sacred bond, are now a requirement according to modern Church Law.&lt;ref&gt;In the Roman Catholic Church, see canons 573, 603 and 654 of the Code of Canon Law 1983; only the Benedictines continue to make the equivalent Benedictine vow.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "clerks regular" of the 16th century and after, such as the [[Jesuits]] and [[Redemptorists]], followed this same general format, though some added a "[[fourth vow]]", indicating some special apostolate or attitude within the order. Fully professed Jesuits (known as "the professed of the fourth vow" within the order), take a vow of particular obedience to the [[Pope]] to undertake any mission laid out in their Formula of the Institute. The [[Missionaries of Charity]], founded by [[St. Teresa of Calcutta]] centuries later (1940s), are another example of this, in that her sisters take a fourth vow of special service to "the poorest of the poor".

=== In the Catholic Church  ===
{{main|Consecrated life (Catholic Church)}}
In the [[Catholic Church]], the vows of members of religious orders and congregations are regulated by canons 654-658 of the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law]]. These are public vows, meaning vows accepted by a superior in the name of the Church,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4E.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1192 §2]&lt;/ref&gt; and they are usually of two durations: temporary, and, after a few years, final vows (permanent or "perpetual"). Depending on the order, temporary vows may be renewed a number of times before permission to take final vows is given. There are exceptions: the [[Jesuits]]' first vows are perpetual, for instance, and the [[Sisters of Charity]] take only temporary but renewable vows.

Religious vows are of two varieties: [[simple vows]] and [[solemn vows]]. The highest level of commitment is exemplified by those who have taken their solemn, perpetual vows. There once were significant technical differences between them in [[canon law]]; but these differences were suppressed by the current [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Code of Canon Law]] in 1983, although the nominal distinction is maintained. Only a limited number of religious congregations may invite their members to solemn vows; most religious congregations are only authorized to take simple vows. Even in congregations with solemn vows, some members with perpetual vows may have taken them simply rather than solemnly.

A perpetual vow can be superseded by the Pope, when he decides that a man under perpetual vows should become a Bishop of the Church. In these cases, the ties to the order the new Bishop had, are dissolved as if the Bishop had never been a member; hence, such a person as, e.g., Pope Francis has had no formal ties to his old order for years. However, if the Bishop was a member in good standing, he will be regarded, informally, as "one of us", and he will always be welcome in any of the order's houses.

There are other forms of [[consecrated life]] in the Catholic Church for men and women. They make a public profession of the [[evangelical counsels]] of chastity, poverty, and obedience, confirmed by a vow or other sacred bond, regulated by [[canon law]] but live consecrated lives in the world (i.e. not as members of a [[religious institute]]). Such are the [[secular institute]]s, the [[Hermit#Consecrated diocesan hermits (canon 603)|hermits]] and the [[consecrated virgin]]s (canon 604) These make a public profession of the evangelical counsels by a vow or other sacred bond. Also similar are the [[society of apostolic life|societies of apostolic life]].

==In the Eastern Orthodox Church==
{{main|Monasticism#Christian monasticism|Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism}}
Although the taking of vows was not a part of the earliest monastic foundations (the wearing of a particular monastic habit is the earliest recorded manifestation of those who had left the world), vows did come to be accepted as a normal part of the [[Tonsure#Christianity|Tonsure]] service in the Christian East. Previously, one would simply find a [[Hesychasm|spiritual father]] and live under his direction. Once one put on the monastic habit, it was understood that one had made a lifetime commitment to God and would remain steadfast in it to the end. Over time, however, the formal Tonsure and taking of vows was adopted to impress upon the monastic the seriousness of the commitment to the ascetic life he or she was adopting.

The vows taken by Orthodox monks are: Chastity, poverty, obedience, and stability. The vows are administered by the [[Hegumen|Abbot]] or [[Hieromonk]] who performs the service.  Following a period of instruction and testing as a novice, a monk or nun may be tonsured with the permission of the candidate's spiritual father. There are three degrees of monasticism in the Orthodox Church: The [[Rassophore#Eastern Orthodox monks|Ryassaphore]] (one who wears the [[Cassock#Eastern practice (Orthodox and Eastern-rite Catholic)|Ryassa]] – however, there are no vows at this level – the Stavrophore (one who wears the cross), and the Schema-monk (one who wears the [[Great Schema]]; i.e., the full monastic habit). The one administering the tonsure must be an ordained priest, and must be a monk of at least the rank he is tonsuring the candidate into. However a [[Eastern Orthodox Church#Organization and leadership|Bishop]] (who, in the Orthodox Church, must always be a monk) may tonsure a monk or nun into any degree regardless of his own monastic rank.

'''Sangat Television''' is TV channel, and is a Project of, and wholly owned by Sangat Trust, a Registered UK charity. The station commenced broadcasting on 1 September 2010, as part of a two-week test phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media247.co.uk/bizasia/newsarchive/2010/09/confusion_over.php|title=Confusion over Sikh religious channel launch|publisher=Biz Asia|date=1 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125154845/http://media247.co.uk/bizasia/newsarchive/2010/09/confusion_over.php|archivedate=25 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Sangat TV is owned by Sangat Trust, a UK Registered Charity backed by [[gurdwara]]s from the UK and from other individuals. The channel is an open platform for the Sikhs [[Sangat (term)|sangat]] to express their views independently. Programming includes educational material on the [[Sikh gurus]] and [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. The channel is now broadcast on Sky channel 755. 

==West Midlands riots==
Sangat TV came into prominence during the [[2011 England riots|West Midlands riots of August 2011]].&lt;ref name="West Midlands riots"&gt;{{cite news |title=West Midlands riots: Sangat TV gets to the heart of the action |author=Huma Qureshi |author2=Mark Sweney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/aug/10/west-midlands-riots-sangat-tv |publisher=The Guardian |date=10 August 2011 |accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presenter Upinder Randhawa notably broadcast live from the streets of Birmingham from the first day of rioting in the area, Monday 8 August 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media247.co.uk/bizasia/newsarchive/2011/08/sangat_tv_switc.php|title=Sangat TV switches to Birmingham riots coverage|publisher=Biz Asia|date=9 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408214116/http://media247.co.uk/bizasia/newsarchive/2011/08/sangat_tv_switc.php|archivedate=8 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/uk-riots-sangat-tv-196099 "UK Riots 2011: Sangat TV Praised for its Heroic Live Coverage"]. ''International Business Times'', August 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; to provide accurate, live information and broadcasts. Coverage was extended to the surrounding areas such as West Bromwich and Wolverhampton the following night. The channel's coverage was used by [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]], [[ITN]] and [[Sky News]] as well as international stations such as [[CNN]], [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] and [[NDTV 24x7]] to show what was happening in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media247.co.uk/bizasia/newsarchive/2011/08/should_asian_me.php|title=Should Asian media follow Sangat TV's coverage?|publisher=Biz Asia|date=10 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910101431/http://media247.co.uk/bizasia/newsarchive/2011/08/should_asian_me.php|archivedate=10 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Riots turn Sikh TV channel into global hit |author=Jiten Karia |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5b2e6596-c4f1-11e0-9c4d-00144feabdc0.html |publisher=Financial Times |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This coverage included sequences of [[Citizen journalism|guerrilla journalism]], most notably footage of the reporting team transporting a police officer in their vehicle in pursuit of looters while live on air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sangat TV's guerrilla journalism wins fans amid riots |author=Caroline Gall |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-14493399 |publisher=BBC News |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the coverage led to Sangat TV presenter Upinder Randhawa's [[Twitter]] following jumping from 600 users to about 4,000 users in one night,&lt;ref name="West Midlands riots" /&gt; as well as having over 4,000 followers to a fan page on [[Facebook]] called "Upinder Randhawa from Sangat TV is a Legend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UK riots: British sikh TV presenter now a Facebook hero |agency=Indo-Asian News Service |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report_uk-riots-british-sikh-tv-presenter-now-a-facebook-hero_1575243 |publisher=Daily News and Analysis |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] hailed Sangat TV's contribution as "an example of a media company's commitment to social responsibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Live &amp; raw: Sikh TV channel wins kudos for coverage |author=Ashis Ray |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-13/uk/29883975_1_news-channels-exclusive-footage-live-coverage |publisher=Times of India |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 August 2011, [[Ofcom]] said it had received one complaint about the previous night's coverage of the riots, in relation to alleged incitement to violence over comments urging people to get out on the streets and protect their property.&lt;ref name="West Midlands riots" /&gt;

==Management issues ==
In 2016, most of the staff of Sangat TV had mostly resigned due to the poor treatment, underpay, where the staff were paid as little as £600 a month for doing a 40 hour a week shift. The channel then has lost most of its programming and it ran as a registered charity with [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission of England and Wales]] with charity number 1139995.

In August 2016, word went round that Sangat TV would be moving its base from [[Edgbaston|Edgbaston, Birmingham]] to [[Southall|Southall, London]] in a bid to get better content and volunteers to run the channel. 


==Ofcom / broadcasting issues==
Sangat TV was fined £30,000 over a debate in which guests supported an assassination attempt on a former Indian Army general, [[Kuldip Singh Brar]], who led the army attack on [[Akal Takht]] in [[Operation Blue Star]] in June 1984.

In 2015, the [[Ofcom]] [[Broadcasting]] Code was broken when Sangat TV continuously aired a song hailing 'Sukha Jinda', two criminals who had robbed a bank, with justification that it was an advert from [[Dharam Seva Records]]. The complainant considered that the video glorified the actions of two Sikh nationalists [[Harjinder Singh Jinda]] and [[Sukhdev Singh Sukha]] ("Jinda" and "Sukha" respectively). These men, who were members of the [[Khalistan Commando Force]], were hanged in 1992 for the assassination of General [[Arun Shridhar Vaidya|Arun Shridhar Vadiya]], the Chief of the [[Indian Army]] responsible for [[Operation Blue Star|Operation Bluestar]] in 1984. They were also found responsible for the murder of two Indian politicians.

Ofcom upheld a complaint made by Dr Parvinder Singh Garcha. The programme, which aired in September 2014 included a live debate in advance of an election for a new committee to run the [[Gurdwara]] Sri Guru Singh Sabha in Southall, West London. At the end of the debate two videos were shown. The second video also included the claim that money had been stolen from a donation box in the Gurdwara during a period when the Baaj Group was in control. Ofcom noted that the decision to include the second video was made by the presenter during the course of the programme and that Dr Garcha said that he had left the studio before at the end of the debate (i.e. before the video in question was shown). However, in Ofcom's view, it is reasonable to expect that before making such a decision, a broadcaster would be familiar with the content of any material it planned to broadcast. Ofcom considered that the Baaj Group was treated unfairly in this respect in the programme as broadcast.

==Education==
Salko went to school in [[Lappeenranta]], [[Finland]]. During his early years there he became acquainted and friends with [[Sakari Pinola]], who later recruited him to missionary work in Taiwan. Salko has said he “grew up together” with Pinola.&lt;ref name = Esitutkintapoytakirja /&gt;

==Work in Finland ==
The next five years the Salkos worked as teachers in [[Ristijärvi]] in the [[Kainuu]] province. During that time they furthered the missionary cause in the parish. Salko reported in the FMS magazine ''[[Suomen Lähetyssanomat]]'' in 1970 of a lunch that was arranged as a fundraiser, which had yielded more than 3000 [[Finnish mark]]s for mission work. After the five years in Ristijärvi, the Salkos found themselves in 1970 in the mission candidates’ course with the FMS in [[Helsinki]].&lt;ref name = "17+7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

After that they began their work in [[The Finnish dormitory in Taichung]], which at the time was operated in rented premises. The Finnish children attended [[Morrison Academy]], an [[United States|American]] school that functioned in [[Taichung]]. The distance from the children’s homes to the school was between 200 and 300 [[kilometers]].

Due to a change in the city plan, Morrison had to abandon its old campus and built a new one outside the city. At this stage, a separate building for the Finnish dormitory was built on the new campus. The planning of the dormitory building had many twists and turns, but in the end Seppo Salko had the final word in determining what the building was to be like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{cquote|Our new home offers better living quarters for our children, as well as a quiet atmosphere for studying and possibilities for leisure activities. Housekeeping, too, has become easier due to the more spacious and practical premises. A completely new thing to be glad about is the Finnish [[sauna]] that was built next to the main bathroom. The children’s playing room is so large that lessons can be arranged there. Even though the [[curriculum]] of the American school is mostly similar to those of Finnish schools, it is natural that they give weight to different subjects. The [[Finnish language]] and [[Finnish geography]] are subjects in which we must provide complementary instruction, so that the children will be prepared for their return to Finland.

All in all we believe that the Lord Himself has created this possibility before us and opened the gates for us. With the same costs we could never offer Finnish education of the same quality and diversity from preschool to ‘[[matriculation]]’.

Our new dormitory is an answer to many years of prayers. We, the ‘parents’, pray continually that this home could fulfill its task: to be such a good place to the children that their parents could safely and free of worries dedicate themselves to their proper work.}}

During the school year 1975–76, the Salkos had a [[furlough]] in Finland, and another missionary couple, Simo and Tarja Lipasti, ran the dormitory during that time.&lt;ref&gt;Ijäs 1987, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salkos’ second term began in 1976 and ended in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;Ijäs 1987, p. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''First Maharaja of the princely state''' '''of Kolhapur''', he was an invaluable gem in the history of Maharashtra. Greatly influenced by the contributions of social reformer Jyotiba Phule, Shahu Maharaj was an ideal leader and able ruler who was associated with many progressive and path breaking activities during his rule. From his coronation in 1894 till his demise in 1922, he worked tirelessly for the cause of the lower caste subjects in his state. Primary education to all regardless of caste and creed was one of his most significant priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/PLkr7jdpCeZepho8RMVJbN/Rajarshi-Shahu-Chhatrapati-of-Kolhapur-a-reformer-ahead-of.html|title=Rajarshi Shahu Chhatrapati of Kolhapur, a reformer ahead of his time|last=Ghadyalpatil|first=Abhiram|date=2018-08-10|work=Livemint|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.siasat.com/news/rajarshi-shahu-chhatrapati-kolhapur-reformer-ahead-his-time-1390707/|title=Rajarshi Shahu Chhatrapati of Kolhapur, a reformer ahead of his time – The Siasat Daily|website=www.siasat.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Portrait of HH Shahu Chhatrapati Mahara.jpg|thumb|250px|Maharaja of Kolhapur in 1894]]

==Early life==

[[File:H.H. Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj seated with palace servants.jpg|thumb|250px|H.H. Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj seated with palace servants]]

He was born as Yeshwantrao in the Ghatge Royal Maratha family, of Kagal village of the Kolhapur district as Yeshwantrao Ghatge to Jaisingrao and Radhabai in June 26, 1874. Jaisingrao Ghatge was the village chief, while his mother Radhabhai hailed from the royal family of Mudhol. Young Yeshwantrao lost his mother when he was only three. His education was supervised by his father till he was 10-year-old. In that year, he was adopted by Queen Anandibai, widow of Kingh Shivaji IV, of the princely state of Kolhapur. Although the adoption rules of the time dictated that the child must have Bhosale dynasty blood in his vein, Yeshwantrao’s family background presented a unique case. He completed his formal education at the [[Rajkumar College, Rajkot]] and took lessons of administrative affairs from Sir [[Stuart_Fraser_(diplomat)|Stuart Fraser]], a representative of the Indian Civil Services. He ascended the throne in 1894 after coming of age, prior to which a regency council appointed by the British Government took care of the state affairs. During his accession Yeshwantrao was renamed as Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj.Chhatrapati Shahu was over five feet nine inches in height and displayed a regal and majestic appearance. Wrestling was one of his favourite sports and he patronised the sport throughout his rule. Wrestlers from all over the country would come to his state to participate in wrestling competitions. 

He was married to Lakshmibai Khanvilkar, daughter of a nobleman from Baroda in 1891. The couple had four
children – two sons and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culturalindia.net/reformers/shahu-chhatrapati.html|title=shahu chatrapati|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedokta controversy==
When Brahmin priests of the royal family refused to perform the rites of non-Brahmins in accordance with the Vedic hymns, he took the daring step of removing the priests and appointment a young Maratha as the religious teacher of the non-Brahmins, with the title of Kshatra Jagadguru(the world teacher of the Kshatriyas). This was known as the Vedokta controversy. It brought a hornet's nest about his ears, but he was not the man to retrace his steps in the face of opposition. He soon became the leader of the non-Brahmin movement and united the Marathas under his banner.&lt;ref name="Indian Express"&gt;{{cite web | title=Pune’s endless identity wars | website=Indian Express | url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/pune-s-endless-identity-wars/734020/ | accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rajarshi Shahu Chhatrapati Papers: 1900-1905 A.D.: Vedokta controversy|publisher=Shahu Research Institute, 1985 - Kolhapur (Princely State)|url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Rajarshi_Shahu_Chhatrapati_Papers_1900_1.html?id=mR4_AQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social reform==

[[File:Group at Residency including the Maharaja of Kolhapur.jpg|thumb|250px|Group at Residency including the Maharaja of Kolhapur]]

Chhatrapati Shahu occupied the throne of Kolhapur for 28 years, from 1894 to 1922, and during this period he initiated numerous social reforms in his empireShahu Maharaj is credited with doing much to further the lot of the lower [[caste]]s and indeed this assessment is warranted. He also ensured suitable employment for students thus educated, thereby creating one of the earliest [[Affirmative action]](50% reservation to weaker sections) programs in history. Many of these measures were effected in the year 1902 on July 26.&lt;ref name="Today 1902"&gt;{{cite web | last=Today | first=Nagpur | title= Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj gave reservation to Bahujan Samaj to the tune of 50% on July 26, 1902 for the first time in history of India | website=Nagpur Today : Nagpur News | date=26 July 1902 | url=http://www.nagpurtoday.in/meritorious-x-xii-students-honoured-by-bsp/07271411 | accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started Shahu Chhatrapati Weaving and Spinning Mill in 1906 to provide employment. [[Rajaram college]] was built by Shahu Maharaj and afterwards it was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rare photos, letters to offer a glimpse into Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj's life|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/Rare-photos-letters-to-offer-a-glimpse-into-Rajarshi-Shahu-Maharajs-life/articleshow/47807999.cms}}&lt;/ref&gt;. His emphasis was on education and his aim was to make education available to masses. He introduced a number of educational programs to promote education among his subjects. He established hostels separately for different ethnicities and religions like Panchals, Devadnya, Nabhik, Shimpi, Dhor-Chambhar communities as well as for Muslims, Jains and Christians. He established the Miss Clarke Boarding School for the socially quarantined segments of the community. He introduced several scholarships for the poor but meritorious students from backward castes. He also initiated a compulsory free primary education for all in his state. He established Vedic Schools that enabled students from all castes and classes to learn the scriptures and propagate Sanskrit education among all. He also started special schools for the village heads or ‘Patils’ to make them into better administrators.

Chhatrapati Sahu was a strong advocate of equality among all strata of the society and refused to give the Brahmins any special status. He removed Brahmins from the post of Royal Religious advisers when they refused to perform religious rites for non-Brahmins. He appointed a young Maratha scholar in the post and bestowed him the title of `Kshatra Jagadguru' (the world teacher of the Kshatriyas). This incident together with the Shahu’s encouragement of the non-Brahmins to read and recite the Vedas led to the Vedokta controversy in Maharashtra. The Vedokta controversy brought a storm of protest from the elite strata of the society; a vicious opposition of the Chhatrapati’s rule. He established the Deccan Rayat Association in Nipani during 1916. The association sought to secure political rights for non-Brahmins and invite their equal participation in politics. Shahuji was influenced by the works of Jyotiba Phule, and he long patronized the Satya Shodhak Samaj, formed by Phule. In his later life, he, however, moved towards the Arya Samaj.

In 1903, he attended the [[Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra]], and in May that year he received the honorary degree [[LL.D.]] from the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=28 May 1902 |page_number=12 |issue=36779| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chhatrapati Shahu made great efforts to abolish the concept of caste segregation and untouchability. He introduced (perhaps the first known) reservation system in government jobs for untouchable castes. His Royal Decree ordering his subjects to treat every member of the society as equal and granting the untouchables equal access to public utilities like wells and ponds, as well as establishments like schools and hospitals. He legalised inter-caste marriages and made a lot of efforts for the upliftment of the dalits. He discontinued the hereditary transfer of titles and tenures of revenue collectors (Kulkarni), a caste infamous for exploiting the masses, especially enslavement of the Mahars, a lower caste.

The Chhatrapati also worked towards betterment of the conditions of women in his empire. He established schools to educate the women, and also spoke vociferously on the topic of women education. He introduced a law banning the Devadsi Pratha, the practice of offering girls to God, which essentially led to exploitation of the girls in the hands of the Clergy. He legalised widow remarriages in 1917 and made efforts towards stopping child marriages.

He introduced a number of projects that enabled his subjects to self-sustain in their chosen professions. The Shahu Chhatrapati Spinning and Weaving Mill, dedicated market places, establishment of co-operative societies for farmers were introduced by the Chhatrapati to alleviate his subjects from middle men in trading. He made credits available to farmers looking to buy equipment to modernise agricultural practices and even established the King Edward Agricultural Institute to teach the farmers to increase crop yield and related technologies. He initiated the Radhanagari Dam on February 18, 1907 and the project was completed in 1935. The dam stands testament to Chhatrapati Shahu’s vision towards the welfare of his subjects and made Kolhapur self-sufficient in water.

He was a great patron of art and culture and encouraged artists from music and fine arts. He supported writers and researchers in their endeavours. He installed gymnasiums and wrestling pitches and highlighted the importance of health consciousness among the youth. 

His seminal contribution in social, political, educational, agricultural and cultural spheres earned him the title of Rajarshi, which was bestowed upon him by the Kurmi warrior community of Kanpur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culturalindia.net/reformers/shahu-chhatrapati.html|title=shahu maharaj|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== &lt;small&gt;Association with Dr. B. R. Ambedkar&lt;/small&gt; ==
Chhatrapati was introduced to Bhimrao Rammji Ambedkar by artists Dattoba Pawar and Dittoba Dalvi. The King was greatly impressed by the great intellect of young Bhimrao and his revolutionary ideas regarding untouchability. The two met a number of times during 1917-1921 and went over possible ways to abolish the negatives of caste segregation. Together they organised a conference for the betterment of the untouchables during March 21-22, 1920 and Chhatrapati made Dr. Ambedkar the Chairman as he believed that Dr. Ambedkar was the leader who would work for the amelioration of the segregated segments of the society. He even donated Rs. 2,500 to Dr. Ambedkar when he started his newspaper ‘Mooknayak’ on January 31, 1921, and contributed more later for the same cause. Their association lasted till the Chhatrapati’s death in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culturalindia.net/reformers/shahu-chhatrapati.html|title=shahu maharaj|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

[[File:H.H.Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj sitting amongst crowds watching a wrestling match.jpg|thumb|250px|H.H.Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj sitting amongst crowds watching a wrestling match]]

In 1891, Shahu married Lakshmibai née Khanvilkar(1880–1945), daughter of a [[Maratha]] nobleman from [[Baroda]]. They were the parents of four children:

* [[Rajaram III]], who succeeded his father as Maharaja of Kolhapur.
* Radhabai 'Akkasaheb' Puar, Maharani of [[Dewas|Dewas (senior)]](1894–1973) who married Raja [[Tukojirao III]] of Dewas(Senior) and had issue:
**Vikramsinhrao Puar, who became Maharaja of Dewas(Senior) in 1937 and who later succeeded to the throne of Kolhapur as [[Shahaji II]].
* Sriman Maharajkumar Shivaji(1899–1918)
* Shrimati Rajkumari Aubai(1895); died young

== Death ==
The great social reformer Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj died on May 6, 1922. He was succeeded by his eldest son Rajaram III as the Maharaja of Kolhapur. It was unfortunate that the reforms initiated by Chhatrapati Shahu gradually began to cease and fade for the lack of able leadership to carry on the legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culturalindia.net/reformers/shahu-chhatrapati.html|title=shahu maharaj|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suryavansha''' ('''Suryavam(n)sham''' or '''Solar Dynasty''') is a historical  dynasty of [[ancient India]]. The term '''Suryavanshi''' refers to a person belonging to the Suryvansha dynasty. [[Raghuvanshi]] is an offshoot dynasty born out of the Suryavanshi clan.

==Sources==
The ''[[Purana]]s'', particularly the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'', the ''[[Ramayana]]'' of [[Valmiki]] and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' of [[Vyasa]] all contain accounts of this dynasty.

The ''[[Raghuvaṃśa|Raghuvansha]]'' of [[Kalidasa]] also mentions the names of some of the kings of this dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pargiter |first=F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6177">The '''Synod of Milan''' or '''Council of Milan''' may refer to any of several [[synod]]s which occurred in late Roman [[Mediolanum]] or medieval [[Milan]] in northern [[Italy]]'s [[Po River|Po valley]]:

== Synod of 345 ==
It is certainly true that in 353 or 354 [[Pope Liberius]] wrote thus: ''"Eight years ago the Eusebian deputies, Eudoxius and Martyrius (who came to the West with the formula {{lang-gr|μακρόστικος}}), refused to [[anathema]]tize the [[Arian doctrine]] at Milan"''. But the Synod of Milan here alluded to is placed about the year 345, soon after the [[Synod of Sardica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Council of Sardica}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[St. Maximinus]] was at this synod.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=St. Maximinus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synod of 355 ==
[[File:Basilica di Santa Tecla Milano 4.jpg|right|thumb|Ruins of the Basilica Maior where was held the 355 synod]]
[[Lucifer of Cagliari]] was deputed by [[Pope Liberius]], with the priest Pancratius and the [[Hilary the Deacon|deacon Hilary]], to request the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantius II|Constantius]] to convene a council, to deal with the accusations directed against [[St. Athanasius]] and his previous condemnation. This council was convened at Milan in the newly erected [[Basilica di Santa Tecla|Basilica Nova]] (or Basilica Maior or St. Tecla).&lt;ref name="Tolfo"&gt;{{cite web| last = Tolfo| first = Maria Grazia| title = San Dionigi  | publisher = Storia di Milano | accessdate=10 October 2011|url=http://www.storiadimilano.it/citta/Porta_Orientale/dionigi.htm}}{{Language icon|it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council however did not follow the hopes of the Pope due to the overwhelming number of Arians bishops and the initial forced absence of the champion of the Nicaean faith, [[Eusebius of Vercelli]]. Lucifer there defended the [[Bishop of Alexandria]] (Athanasius) with much passion and in very violent language, thus furnishing the adversaries of the great Alexandrian with a pretext for resentment and further violence, and causing a new condemnation of Athanasius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Lucifer of Cagliari}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bishop of Milan]] [[Dionysius (bishop of Milan)|Dionysius]] initially seemed ready to follow the Arians in condemning Athanasius, accused not of heresy but of [[lese-majesty]] against the Emperor.&lt;ref name="DCA"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia =Dizionario della Chiesa Ambrosiana| volume=2|last = Pasini| first = Cesare| title = Dionigi, santo (sec. IV) | publisher = NED | location = Milano | year = 1988 | isbn = 88-7023-102-X |page=1054&amp;ndash;1055}}{{Language icon|it}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the arrival of Eusebius the situation changed: Eusebius requested an immediate subscription of the Nicaean faith by the bishops. Eusebius, Lucifer and Dionysius signed, but the Arian bishop Valens of Mursia violently shreded the act of faith. Constantius, unaccustomed to independence on the part of the bishops, moved the synod to his palace and grievously maltreated the papal embassy. Hilary was flogged and the exiled along with Pancratius and the two Nicaean bishops. The synod, now governed by the Arians bishops of the court of Constantius, ended supporting Arian statements.

== Synod of 389 ==
Augustine's "On the Good of Marriage" was written against somewhat that still remained of the [[heresy]] of [[Jovinian]]. He mentions this error in b. ii. c. 23, de ''Nuptiis et Conc. Jovinianus'', he says, who a few years since tried to found a new heresy, said that the [[Catholic]]s favored the [[Manichæan]]s, because in opposition to him they preferred holy Virginity to Marriage. ''"That heresy took its rise from one Jovinianus, a [[monk]], in our own time, when we were yet young"''. And he adds that it was soon overborne and extinguished, say about A.D. 390, having been condemned first at Rome, then at Milan. There are letters of [[Pope Siricius]] on the subject to the Church of Milan, and the answer sent him by the Synod of Milan, at which [[St. Ambrose]] presided. [[Jerome]] had refuted Jovinian, but was said to have attempted the defense of the excellency of the virgin state, at the expense of condemning marriage.&lt;ref name=AGO&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Augustine]]|title =Of the Good of Marriage: Preface| url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1309.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[St. Maximus of Turin]] was at a "synod of Milan" in 389 at which Jovinianus was condemned, according to his ninth [[homily]].&lt;ref name=CEMAX&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=St. Maximus of Turin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synod of 451==
In 451, St. Maximus of Turin was again at a synod in Milan where the bishops of Northern Italy accepted the celebrated letter (''epistola dogmatica'') of [[Pope Leo I]], setting forth the orthodox doctrine of the [[Incarnation]] against the [[Nestorianism|Nestorians]] and [[Eutychians]]. Among nineteen subscribers Maximus is the eighth, and since the order was determined by age, Maximus must then have been about seventy years old.&lt;ref name=CEMAX/&gt;

== Synod of 860 ==
A synod that took place in Milan in 860 summoned Ingiltrud, wife of Boso, to appear before it because she had left her husband for a paramour. [[Pope Nicholas I]] commanded the bishops in the dominions of [[Charles the Bald]] to excommunicate her unless she returned to her husband. As she paid no attention to the summons, she was put under the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Pope St. Nicholas I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Temple of [[Janus]]" is a cultic structure of [[Romano-Celtic temple|Romano-Celtic design]] located in [[Autun]], [[Saône-et-Loire]], [[France]], to the North-West of the ancient city of [[Autun#Early history|Augustodunum]].

The temple lies in the center of a vast sanctuary, whose extent and complexity was revealed by excavations conducted from 2013 to 2016, on a site whose history goes back to [[Neolithic]] times, and which experienced an important phase of monumental constructions in the 1st Century CE. The temple was abandoned at the onset of the [[Early Middle Ages]], and its structures were later reused in the fashioning of a Medieval defensive work. The temple has retained two sides of its square ''[[cella]]'', at a height of over 20 meters, as well as vestiges of its [[ambulatory]] and side structure foundations. The temple's supposed dedication to the Roman god Janus is not based on any archaeological or historic fact, and the deity that was venerated in the temple is unknown.

The Temple of Janus was included on the first list of [[Monument historique|protected historical French monuments]], established in 1840.&lt;ref name="merimee"&gt;{{Base Mérimée|PA00113101}} Temple de Janus&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple was built outside the walls of the ancient city of Augustodunum, in a place known as ''la Genetoye'',&lt;ref name="merimee"/&gt; beside a road that, after passing through the [[Arroux]] gate and over the river, headed West towards [[Lutetia]] ([[Paris]]), the valley of the [[Loire]], and [[Cenabum]] ([[Orléans]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nouvel (2010), [https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00819028/document (French language, external link)], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Labaune and Le Bohec (2007), [http://rae.revues.org/1536 (French language, external link)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The site sits at an average altitude of 290 meters, atop a [[plateau]] that gradually slopes downward towards the valleys of the Arroux to the South and the [[Ternin]], one of its tributaries, to the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Coord|46.96125
|4.28828}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of the temple is inseparable from the whole in which it is part. The site of ''la Genetoye'' was used since Neolithic times without notable interruption until the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Labaune (2013), [http://www.artehis-cnrs.fr/Les-fouilles-programmees-sur-le,1377 (French language, external link)]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Geophysical exploration and aerial photography have demonstrated the existence of a vast Neolithic enclosure, accompanied with layouts whose functions are ill-defined.&lt;ref&gt;''Le complexe monumental'' (2012), [https://www.autun.com/uploads/documents/decouvrir-autun/actes-journee-actu-archeo-autun-2012.pdf (French language, external link)], p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;
On-site excavations over the course of 2012 have revealed the presence of [[La Tène]] usage which lasted up until the [[Augustus|Augustan age]]. Some outlines, whose nature and function have yet to be defined (perhaps an earlier cultic structure), have also been found within the footprint of the temple. They are dated to the first half of the 1st Century CE.&lt;ref name=joly37&gt;Joly and Barral (2014), pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Haut-du-Verger'' theater, discovered in the same area in 1976&lt;ref&gt;Devauges (1979), [http://www.persee.fr/doc/galia_0016-4119_1979_num_37_2_1615 (French language, external link)]&lt;/ref&gt;  and excavated the following year, provides an additional structure in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Ferreira and Louis (2014), pp. 39–41&lt;/ref&gt; The principle monuments of the site, the theater and Temple of Janus, appear to have been constructed in the second half of the 1st Century or at the onset of the 2nd Century,&lt;ref&gt;Kasprzyk (2005), [https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00621362/document section: ''Fonctionnaires et militaires''] (French language, external link), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; with later modifications and adjustments. The site could have hosted a military presence at the end of the third century, beyond which period no convincing evidence has been recorded.

In the Middle Ages, the ''cella'' of the temple was reused for the construction of a fortification that included a ditch. This reuse may partially explain the temple's good state of preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Joly and Barral (2014), pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;

The Temple of Janus was designated as a ''monument historique'' in 1840.&lt;ref name="merimee" /&gt;

== Description ==
The Temple of Janus probably dates back to the second half of the 1st Century CE, like the other principal monuments of Augustodunum.&lt;ref&gt;Rebourg and Goudineau (1986), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is truly an ancient monument, its claimed dedication to the cult of [[Janus]] is not based on any reality. The deity to which the temple had been consecrated is unknown. The name of Janus could simply be a corruption of the toponym ''Genetoye''&lt;ref&gt;Kasprzyk, Méniel, Barral, and Daubigney (2010), [http://rhr.revues.org/7680#tocto2n3 section: Les données de l'archéologie] (French language, external link), p. 646&lt;/ref&gt; (meaning a place where [[broom]], ''genêts'' in French, was said to grow since the 16th century&lt;ref&gt;Abord (1886), [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5612990v/f280.image (French language, external link)], p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;). A historical marker near the temple explains:

{{Quote|text=To the North-West of the ancient city, on the right bank of the Arroux, grew a district whose sole visible vestige is the temple "of Janus", underlining its cultic vocation.&amp;nbsp;... The particular form of this temple, called a ''[[fanum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Note: In French usage, the term ''fanum'' refers to the specific type of structure represented by the Temple of Janus, although in English usage such structures are typically termed [[Romano-Celtic temple]]s, as the word ''fanum'' in English has a broader sense of ancient sacred spaces in general.&lt;/ref&gt; is of the Gaulish tradition even though its architectural technique, datable to the 1st Century of our era, was Roman. The name of Janus had been incorrectly ascribed to it in the 16th Century by the historian [[Pierre de Saint-Julien de Balleure]], who thus interpreted the name of the sector where it was erected: ''La Genetoye''. This term in fact references an area where broom (''genêts'') grows. The deity venerated here remains totally unknown.}}

== Architecture ==

=== The sanctuary (''cella'' and gallery) ===
[[file:Autun_Temple_de_Janus_03_PA00013101_JPM.JPG|thumbnail|alt=Close-up showing niches made in the thickness of an ancient wall.|Interior view showing niches found on the ''cella's'' walls.]]
The ''[[cella]]'' was built with a nearly square footprint (16.80 x 16.35&amp;nbsp;m) and its elevation reaches up to around 24 meters, a record for [[Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;Fauduet (1993), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The walls have a thickness of 2.2 meters, built in small, meticulous stonework. The entryway must have been formed by one of the missing walls, probably on the East side. 
[[File:Temple_Janus_Autun_25.jpg|thumbnail|left|alt=Close-up of a straight row of holes in an ancient wall.|Detail of the [[putlog holes]] above the openings (exterior face of the temple).]]
Two walls (South and West) are fully preserved, and the initial construction of the other two walls is still visible. The facing of the walls is entirely made up of small, square [[sandstone]] rubble with no [[terracotta]] inclusions, and the [[putlog holes]] that had supported the scaffolding are still visible. The core of the wall is composed of blockage and rubble mortared in [[Roman concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;Kasprzyk, Méniel, Barral, and Daubigney (2010), [http://rhr.revues.org/7680#tocto2n3 section: Les données de l'archéologie] (French language, external link), p. 647&lt;/ref&gt; The wall was probably penetrated by the ''cella'''s front door, a common placement in Romano-Celtic temples.&lt;ref&gt;Fauduet (1993), pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior of the walls featured four rectangular niches and three small openings crowned with stone [[discharging arch]]es 13 meters above ground, which illuminated the interior of the ''cella''. The interior side of the wall was hollowed by four large, arched niches, 3 meters wide and 5.6 meters tall, but breaches in the wall now give them the appearance of large picture windows.&lt;ref&gt;Duval and Quoniam (1963), [https://doi.org/10.3406%2Fgalia.1963.2385 (French language, external link)], p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; The Western wall features a [[semi-dome]] in its center, which, facing the entry, may have housed the statue of the divinity to which the temple was consecrated. The ''cella'' floor was inlaid with ''[[opus sectile]]'', fragments of which have been retrieved, and the base of an ''[[aedicula]]'' which was installed at the ''cella's'' center is still in place. The ''cella'' would have been covered by a four-sided roof.&lt;ref name=DQ-185&gt;Duval and Quoniam (1963), [https://doi.org/10.3406%2Fgalia.1963.2385 (French language, external link)], p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Holes from the [[joist]]s on the exterior side of the walls 9 meters above the ground, and bases parallel and 5.4 meters away from the walls, prove the existence of a covered gallery (ambulatory) which went around the ''cella'', in accordance with the [[Gallo-Roman]] temple model observed at [[Périgueux]] with the [[tower of Vésone]]. This gallery was probably composed of columns built on the [[peripteros]] wall and supporting a sloping roof.&lt;ref&gt;Grenier (1957), [https://doi.org/10.3406%2Fcrai.1957.10778 (French language, external link)], pp. 260–262&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The ambulatory ===
{{external media|align=right|image1=[http://www.iksis.fr/sitefiles/images/references/restitution-03.jpg Proposed reconstruction of the Temple of Janus] [http://www.iksis.fr/ on the Iksis website]}}
An [[ambulatory]] demarcated the sacred area around the sanctuary, as is often the case for this type of structure.&lt;ref name=DQ-185/&gt; The dimensions proposed after the 19th Century excavations (75 x 50&amp;nbsp;m) cannot be confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;Labaune (2012), [https://www.academia.edu/25408902/Introduction._Etudier_les_lieux_de_culte_de_Gaule_romaine (French language, external link)], p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Studies undertaken in 2012 revealed the existence of two successive and concentric ambulatories, the older, perhaps featuring a [[portico]], could have been connected to the Temple of Janus or an earlier cultic structure.&lt;ref name=joly37/&gt; To the South of the ''cella'', and in the enclosure of the ambulatory, demolished walls could show the presence of an ancillary building.&lt;ref&gt;Duval and Quoniam (1963), [https://doi.org/10.3406%2Fgalia.1963.2385 (French language, external link)], p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bedon, Pinon, and Chevallier (1988), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology of the temple and its surroundings ==
[[file:Autun plan 1871.jpg|thumbnail|alt=View of a historic map depicting an excavation site.|Map of ''la Genetoye'' in 1872 after [[Jacques Gabriel Bulliot|J.-G. Bulliot's]] excavations.]]
In 1871, [[Jacques Gabriel Bulliot]] undertook excavations to the North-West of Autun and around the temple that led to the establishment of a detailed map drawn by [[Jean Roidot-Déléage]].&lt;ref&gt;Labaune (2012), [https://www.academia.edu/25408902/Introduction._Etudier_les_lieux_de_culte_de_Gaule_romaine (French language, external link)], pp. 126–128&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Roidot-Déléage also devoted eight plates of surveys and drawings to the Temple of Janus, which were not published or commented on until 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Duval and Quoniam (1963), [https://doi.org/10.3406%2Fgalia.1963.2385 (French language, external link)]&lt;/ref&gt; The presumably Neolithic structures were revealed in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2915464/Projet_de_fouille_programm%C3%A9e_pluriannuelle_Autun_-_Les_Grands_Champs_Sa%C3%B4ne-et-Loire_enceinte_n%C3%A9olithique ''L'enceinte de Grands Champs (Autun, Saône-et-Loire), projet 2013–2015''] (2012), (French language, external link), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1970s, no excavations were carried out in the area of the Temple of Janus.&lt;ref&gt;Vuillemot (1980), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Aerial surveys lead by [[René Goguey]] in 1976 resulted in the discovery of the Haut-du-Verger theater,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=René Goguey pionnier de l'archéologie aérienne en France, est décédé |website=[[L'Yonne républicaine]] |date=24 August 2015 |url=http://www.lyonne.fr/yonne/actualite/pays/auxerrois/2015/08/24/rene-goguey-pionnier-de-l-archeologie-aerienne-en-france-est-decede_11558433.html |access-date=24 October 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the collection of sparse information obtained on the district, which has since been seen as a vast [[peri-urban]] sanctuary having "the function of uniting different cults of the city".&lt;ref&gt;Kasprzyk (2005), [https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00621362/document section: ''Les sanctuaires périurbains''] (French language, external link), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, public authorities proceeded to acquire the lands in question, finally allowing excavations to take place.&lt;ref&gt;Vuillemot (1980), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Aerial surveys continued until the 2000s when, in 2009, a magnetic survey finally completed the obtained data.&lt;ref&gt;Labaune (2012), [https://www.academia.edu/25408902/Introduction._Etudier_les_lieux_de_culte_de_Gaule_romaine (French language, external link)], p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; A vast archaeological dig and study site was put in place in 2012. It is expected to complete in 2016 and put forth a global vision of the ''la Genetoye'' district, both geographically and historically.&lt;ref&gt;Labaune and Pasquet (2012), [https://www.academia.edu/4215505/Nouvelles_recherches_arch%C3%A9ologiques_dans_le_quartier_du_temple_dit_de_Janus_%C3%A0_Autun_Sa%C3%B4ne-et-Loire_ (French language, external link)], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Denton Watson Jr.''' (born December 2, 1945), better known as '''Tex Watson''', is an American [[murder]]er who was a central member of the "Manson family" led by [[Charles Manson]].&lt;ref name="Linder2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/manson/mansonaccount.html |title=The Charles Manson (Tate–LaBianca Murder) Trial |date=2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303203825/http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/manson/mansonaccount.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |dead-url=no |first=Doug |last=Linder |author-link=Doug Linder |publisher=University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 9, 1969, Watson and other Manson followers murdered pregnant actress [[Sharon Tate]] and four other people at [[10050 Cielo Drive]] in [[Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles]]. The next night, Watson traveled to [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles]], and participated in the murders of [[Manson Family#LaBianca murders|Leno and Rosemary LaBianca]], as part of Manson's [[Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)|"Helter Skelter"]] vision. Watson was found guilty of murder and imprisoned in 1971.

==Early life==
Watson was born in [[Farmersville, Texas]], on December 2, 1945, and grew up in nearby [[Copeville, Texas|Copeville]]. He was the youngest of three children.{{cn|date=March 2017}} Tex grew up apparently{{clarify|date=March 2017}} attending the Copeville Methodist Church. In high school he was an honor student and athlete, and worked as the editor on the school paper.{{cn|date=March 2017}} In September 1964, Watson moved to [[Denton, Texas]], to attend [[University of North Texas]], where he joined a fraternity.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Adult life==
===Tate murders===
{{see also|Tate murders|}}
In January 1967 Watson began working at [[Braniff International Airways|Braniff International]] as a baggage handler. Using free airline tickets to travel, he visited a fraternity brother in Los Angeles; there he became interested in the psychedelic and music lifestyle of the late 1960s. Soon Watson met some women who were in the [[Manson Family]], and then met [[Charles Manson]]. Watson decided to join the [[Manson Family]] shortly afterwards.

On August 9, 1969 as a member of the Manson Family, Watson went with [[Susan Atkins]], [[Linda Kasabian]], and [[Patricia Krenwinkel]] to a large estate on Cielo Drive in Hollywood, leased by movie director [[Roman Polanski]] and his wife, actress [[Sharon Tate]]. Polanski was in London, England  working on a film on August 8th. At the home were Sharon Tate and her friends: hairdresser [[Jay Sebring]], writer [[Tate murders|Wojciech Frykowski]], and Folger's coffee heiress [[Tate murders|Abigail Folger]].

Watson, who had been to the [[10050 Cielo Drive]] address on at least one other occasion, climbed a telephone pole near the security gate and cut the house phone line. The entire Manson group then climbed over the fence. When a car from the guest house approached, driven by an 18‑year‑old named [[Tate murders#Murders|Steven Parent]], Watson ignored his pleas for mercy and shot Parent four times in the chest and abdomen at point-blank range.&lt;ref name="cielodrive.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/charles-manson-parole-hearing-2012.php|title=Parole Hearing: Charles Manson 2012 - Cielodrive.com|website=www.cielodrive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cielodrive.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/charles-tex-watson-parole-hearing-1978.php|title=Charles "Tex" Watson 1978 Parole Hearing Transcript - Cielodrive.com|website=www.cielodrive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After pushing Parent's car further up the driveway and traversing the front lawn, Watson cut the screen of a window and let Atkins and Krenwinkel in through the front door.&lt;ref name="cielodrive.com1"/&gt; Upon Watson's direction, Atkins found the house's three other occupants, and with Krenwinkel, brought them to the living room. Watson tied Tate and Sebring together at the neck with rope and slung it up over a beam. Sebring started to resist and Watson shot him. After Watson shot Sebring and took $70 from Folger's purse, Folger and Frykowski bolted from the house, but they were chased outside, and after being stabbed further, died on the front lawn. Watson and his crime partners inflicted 28 stab wounds to Folger alone.&lt;ref name="cielodrive.com"/&gt; Tate, Sebring and Frykowski all suffered numerous stab wounds. Sebring and Frykowski were also shot.

===LaBianca murders===
The next night, Charles Manson (who was displeased by their performance and pledged to show them "how to do it") drove six "Manson Family" members, [[Leslie Van Houten]], [[Steve "Clem" Grogan]] and the four from the previous night into Los Angeles. In March 1968, Manson and other Family members had attended a party at the rented home of Harold True in Los Feliz, located at 3267 Waverly Drive. Manson did not want to kill True because he thought it could be traced back to him, so he settled for the house next door where Leno and Rosemary LaBianca lived. After driving their car up and down the street, and waiting, Manson and Watson got out of the car, disappeared walking up the driveway and entered the home together. According to Watson's book ''Will You Die For Me?'',&lt;ref name=DieForMe&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=Charles |last2=Hoekstra |first2=Ray |url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/main/books/will-you-die-for-me |title=Will You Die For Me? |date=1978 |accessdate=2016-04-02}}{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}} Manson held the occupants at gunpoint while Watson tied them up. Manson returned to the car to say he had tied up the house's occupants and sent Krenwinkel and Van Houten into the house.

Krenwinkel and Van Houten took Rosemary LaBianca to her bedroom as Watson murdered Leno LaBianca in the den. Rosemary LaBianca was then murdered in her room, primarily by Krenwinkel and Watson, with additional (and possibly postmortem) wounds inflicted in her back by Van Houten. Both victims were stabbed numerous times and the word "WAR" was carved into Leno LaBianca's stomach; a fork was also left protruding from his stomach. Krenwinkel smeared words and phrases from, or inspired by, lyrics from recent Beatles songs such as "WAR", "Healter Skelter" (sic), "RISE", and "Death to Pigs" onto the walls and various surfaces in the victims' blood.

===Conviction===
On October 2, 1969, Watson fled the [[Spahn Ranch]] and headed back to his native state of Texas. On November 30, 1969, Watson was arrested in Texas for the Tate–LaBianca murders. He and his lawyers fought extradition to California for nine months. Upon arriving in California, Watson stopped talking and eating, losing 55 pounds, and began regressing to a catatonic state. He was admitted to [[Atascadero State Hospital]] for a 90‑day evaluation period to determine if he was fit to stand trial. Watson stayed there until February 1971, when he was deemed able to stand trial.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi1994"/&gt;{{rp|514–515}}

On October 12, 1971, Watson was convicted of seven counts of first degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder.&lt;ref name="cielodrive.com1"/&gt; A week later, the same jury took only two and a half hours to determine that Watson was sane.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

On October 21, 1971, Watson was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. He arrived on California's death row Nov. 17, 1971. He escaped execution when the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]]'s ''[[People v. Anderson]]'' decision resulted in the invalidation of all death sentences imposed in California prior to 1972.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi1994"/&gt;{{rp|661–662}} Watson was found guilty of the murders of seven people&amp;nbsp;— Abigail Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Steven Parent, Sharon Tate Polanski who was eight months pregnant, Jay Sebring, Leno LaBianca and Rosemary LaBianca&amp;nbsp;— and his seven counts were to be served concurrently. His minimum eligible parole date was November 26, 1976, but he has been denied [[parole]] 17 times since then, including two stipulations; he was most recently given a five-year denial of parole at a board hearing on October 27, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hamilton, Matt |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/parole-denied-for-convicted-manson-follower-charles-tex-watson/ar-AAjujOA |title=Parole denied for convicted Manson follower Charles ‘Tex’ Watson |publisher=MSN |date=2016-10-28 |accessdate=2016-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408085124/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/parole-denied-for-convicted-manson-follower-charles-tex-watson/ar-AAjujOA |archivedate=2017-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He remains incarcerated at [[Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility]] in [[San Diego, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inmatelocator.cdcr.ca.gov/Results.aspx|title=State of California Inmate Locator|first=California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation|last=(CDCR)|website=inmatelocator.cdcr.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incarceration==
According to his prisoner outreach web site, Watson converted to Christianity in 1975.&lt;ref name="aging"&gt;Broughton, Ashley. [http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/03/30/manson.family.aging/index.html "Aging Manson 'Family' members long for freedom."] CNN. March 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Will You Die For Me?'', Watson's autobiography, as told to "Chaplain Ray" (Ray Hoekstra), was published in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lccn.loc.gov/77018539 |title=Library of Congress catalog record on ''Will you die for me?''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, he married Kristin Joan Svege. Through [[conjugal visit]]s they were able to have four children (three boys, one girl), but those visits for life prisoners were banned in October 1996. After 24 years of marriage, Svege divorced Watson after meeting another man in 2003. Svege and Watson remain friends. He had become an ordained minister in 1981, and graduated from [[California Coast University]] in 2009 with a B.S. in Business Management.&lt;ref&gt;Parole Board Hearing Transcript 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Charles|title=About Charles|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/main/about/about-charles-2|website=Aboundinglove.org|publisher=Abounding Love Ministries|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1982, a Southern California‑based group, Citizens for Truth, submitted some 80,000 petition signatures and several thousand letters opposing Watson's parole.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The group received help{{what?|date=April 2016}} from Doris Tate, the mother of victim Sharon Tate. The group was successful in convincing{{how?|date=April 2016}} the California Board of Prison Terms to deny parole for Watson. In later years the group, along with Doris Tate, and her daughters, Patricia and Debra, submitted petitions with more than two million signatures.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In 2012, Watson disputed a request to release recordings of conversations with his attorney. The recordings became part of a bankruptcy proceeding involving the deceased attorney's law firm. Members of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) said they believed the recordings might contain clues about unsolved murder cases involving the Manson family. Watson asked the presiding judge to allow police to listen to the tapes but not take possession of them.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, Michael; Cary, Michael.

In September 2014, Richard Pfeiffer, an attorney for [[Leslie Van Houten]], said that he was considering subpoenaing the tapes to look for information that might help Van Houten in her next parole hearing.&lt;ref name="Van Houten Parole Tapes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Healey|first1=Patrick|title=Attorney May Try Subpoena To Pry Open Recording by Convict Who Killed for Charles Manson|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Attorney-May-Try-Subpoena-To-Pry-Open-Recording-by-Convict-Who-Killed-for-Charles-Manson-275701261.html|publisher=NBC|location=Los Angeles|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vicar''' is the title given to certain parish [[priest]]s in the [[Church of England]]. It has played a significant role in Anglican Church organisation in ways that are different from other [[Christian denomination]]s. The title is very old and arises from the medieval situation where priests were appointed either by a secular lord, by a bishop or by a religious foundation. Wherever there is a vicar he shares the [[benefice]] with a rector (usually non-resident) to whom the great tithes were paid. ''Vicar'' derives from the Latin "vicarius" meaning a substitute.

Historically, Anglican parish priests were divided into [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]]s, vicars and (rarely) [[perpetual curate]]s. These were distinguished according to the way in which they were appointed and remunerated. The church was supported by [[Tithe#Tithes and tithe law in England before reform|tithe]]s: taxes (traditionally of ten percent) levied on the personal and agricultural output of the parish.

==Origin of the term ''vicar''==

Parish churches in England originated as the personal property of (predominantly lay) patrons; who had the right to appoint and dismiss the parish priest, to receive an entrance fee on appointment, and to charge an annual rent thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, David ''The Monastic Order in England'' Cambridge University Press, 1940, p.593&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Gregorian reforms]] of the 11th century, almost all these rights were extinguished for lay patrons, who were able to retain the sole residual power to nominate the rector to a benefice, and many lay notables thereupon gave up parish churches into the ownership of religious houses; who were less inhibited by canon law from extracting fees and rents from rectors, and who could moreover petition for exemption from most such laws by papal dispensation.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, David ''The Monastic Order in England'' Cambridge University Press, 1940, p.597&lt;/ref&gt; Around 40% of rectories in England passed into monastic possession. Initially it had not been unusual for religious houses in possession of rectories also to assume the capability to collect tithe and [[glebe]] income for themselves, but this practice was banned by the decrees of the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council]] of 1215. Thereafter, over the medieval period, monasteries and priories continually sought papal exemption from the Council's decrees, so as to be able to appropriate the income of rectoral benefices to their own use. However, from the 13th century onwards, English diocesan bishops successfully established the principle that only the glebe and ''greater tithes'' could be appropriated by monastic patrons in this manner; sufficient ''lesser tithes'' had to remain within the parochial benefice to ensure a competent living; the incumbent of which thenceforward carried the title of ''vicar''.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, David ''The Religious Orders in England, Vol II'' Cambridge University Press, 1955, p.290&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1535, of 8,838 rectories in England, 3,307 had thus been appropriated with vicarages;&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, David ''The Religious Orders in England, Vol II'' Cambridge University Press, 1955, p.291&lt;/ref&gt; but at this late date, a small sub-set of vicarages in monastic ownership were not being served by beneficed clergy at all. In almost all such instances, these were parish churches in the ownership of houses of [[Canons Regular|Augustinian]] or [[Premonstratensian]] canons, orders whose rules required them to provide parochial worship within their conventual churches; for the most part as chapels of ease of a more distant parish church. From the mid-14th century onwards the canons were able to exploit their hybrid status to justify petitions for papal privileges of appropriation, allowing them to fill vicarages in their possession either from among their own number, or from secular stipendiary priests removable at will; arrangements which corresponded to those for their [[chapels of ease]].&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, David ''The Religious Orders in England, Vol II'' Cambridge University Press, 1955, p.292&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], the rectors and vicars of parishes formerly in monastic possession continued in post, their sources of income unaffected. Rectors received both greater and lesser tithes, vicars the lesser tithes only. Lay grantees of monastic lands also took over the monasteries' rights of nomination to monastic rectories. For monastic vicarages, the right to the greater tithes and to nominate a vicar also generally passed into the hands of lay owners, known as ''impropriators''. Perpetual curates were appointed to the unbeneficed parishes and chapels of ease formerly in the possession of the canons.  These received no tithe income, and originally impropriators were required to provide a fixed stipend; although generally the function of paymaster was eventually taken over by the [[diocese]]. If, in later years, a newly created parish was carved out of a larger rectoral or vicarial parish, the incumbent would be legally a perpetual curate, but would commonly be styled "vicar" in common use.

===''Great'' and ''small'' tithes===
{{main article|Tithe#Tithes and tithe law in England before reform}}
In legislation, the ''Act for the True Payment of Tithes'' of 1548, the great tithes are described as those of corn (that is all cereal crops), hay and wood; and the small tithes as the remainder.  All such tithes were originally paid in kind. Each instance of appropriation, however, was established for an individual parish; and so there was wide local variation. Vicarial (small) tithe frequently included hay and wood; rectoral (great) tithe sometimes included wool (especially in rich wool-producing areas) as well as corn. Otherwise the main components of the small tithe, apart from wool, were milk, eggs, dairy produce and the young of animals raised as food; lambs, piglets, calves, goslings. Since animal young rarely arrived in exact multiples of ten, local custom commonly established cash adjustments to round the tithe value up or down. All or part of the tithed items might have been commuted by local custom to a fixed cash payment; which, following the inflation of the 16th century, reduced commuted tithes to a fraction of their former value.  By the 17th century, many such vicarages had become so poor that there was no prospect of filling them; and the parish might find their [[cure of souls]] effectively annexed in [[Benefice#Pluralism in England|plurality]] to a neighbouring vicarage or rectory, the parishioners consequently being offered at best infrequent opportunities for worship at their own parish church.

== Act of Parliament ==

An Act of Parliament of 1868 permitted perpetual curates to style themselves vicars and the term ''parson'' rapidly lost popularity. The conjunction of this change with near-contemporaneous church reforms aimed at reducing the disparities of income among clergy meant that the distinction between the grades of clergy became progressively less relevant and remarked upon. Popularly, any member of the clergy is often referred to as  a ''vicar'', even when they do not legally hold such a post. In the past a similar situation led to all clergy being popularly referred to as parsons.

== Parishes in England and Wales ==

Most parishes in England and Wales retain the historical title for their parish priest—rector or vicar—with vicar being more common in the urban areas, because of an expansion of new Parishes being created in the Victorian years, and the incumbents being styled 'vicar' after 1868. The distinction between the titles is now only historical. In the late 20th century, a [[priest shortage|shortage of clergy]] and the disparity of workload between parish clergy led to the development of a number of new forms of parish ministry.

In Wales prior to Disestablishment most parishes in the southern dioceses (St. Davids and Llandaff) were vicarages subject to lay patronage, whereas in the north rectors predominated largely nominated by the bishops of Bangor and St. Asaph.

=== Team Rector and Team Vicar ===

One of these, which has proved relatively effective, is the ''Team'' ministry or [[benefice]]. Under this arrangement, a number of parishes conjoin to form a ''team'', in which each parish retains its legal definition and independence. Rather than having clergy licensed to the individual parishes, a team of clergy are licensed to the entire ''benefice''. Alternatively, a large parish with daughter churches in addition to a parish church, may be created as a Team Ministry.

In these examples, one incumbent-level priest is regarded as "first among equals", takes the title ''team rector'' and serves as parish priest in one or more parishes (often the larger), while one or more priests of incumbent status, who may or may not be [[stipend]]iary, serve as ''team vicars''. Team vicars are often installed into other parishes within the team. Other clergy—perhaps part time stipendiary or non-stipendiary—and those in training positions are formally ''assistant [[curate]]s'' and are often known as ''team curate'' or, for instance, ''associate priest''.

Until the introduction of [[Common Tenure]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.churchofengland.org › Clergy &amp; Office Holders|url=http://www.churchofengland.org/clergy-office-holders/common-tenure.aspx|website=Church of England|accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; team rectors and team vicars were not appointed as perpetual parish priests, and as such did not possess the ''freehold'' but were licensed for a fixed term, known as ''leasehold'', usually seven years for a team rector, and five years for a team vicar.  With the introduction of Common Tenure most parochial clergy have similar terms of appointment and there is less distinction in terms of "employment" rights between Team clergy and other incumbents than hitherto.

== Other Anglican provinces ==

In many other [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] [[province (Anglican)|provinces]], the distinction between a vicar and a rector is different. In the [[Church of Ireland]] and the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], most parish priests are [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]]s. In the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], a vicar is a priest in charge of a [[Mission (Christian)|mission]], meaning a congregation supported by its diocese instead of being a self-sustaining parish which is headed by a rector.

== Ulster ==

In early 17th-century [[Ulster]] every church had a vicar and a [[parson]] instead of a [[co-arb]] and an [[erenagh]]. The vicar, like the co-arb, was always in orders. He said the mass ('serveth the cure') and received a share of the tithes. The parson, like the erenagh, had a major portion of the tithes, maintained the church and provided hospitality.

As he was not usually in clerical orders, his responsibilities were mainly temporal. However, there were differences in the divisions of the tithes between various dioceses in Tyrone. In the [[Diocese of Clogher (Church of Ireland)|Diocese of Clogher]], the vicar and the parson shared the tithes equally between them; in the [[Diocese of Derry and Raphoe|Diocese of Derry]], church income came from both tithes and the rental of church lands ('temporalities'). The vicar and the parson each received one third of the tithes and paid an annual [[tribute]] to the bishop.

In places where there was no parson, the erenagh continued to receive two thirds of the [[income in kind]] from the church lands, and delivered the balance, after defraying maintenance, to the bishop in cash as a yearly rental. In other places, the parson, the vicar and the erenagh shared the costs of church repairs equally between them. In the [[Diocese of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Diocese of Armagh]] the parson received two-thirds of the tithes and the vicar one third. The archbishop and the erenagh impropriated no part thereof, presumably because they received the entire income from the termon lands. The division of responsibilities between vicar and parson seems to derive from a much earlier precedent established in the old Celtic Church of [[St Columcille]].

== Cultural associations==

The image of the parish vicar is a popular one in British culture. A popular British television series on [[BBC]] depicts a fictional woman vicar humorously in ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'', and the story of [[The Vicar of Bray]] appears as a song and otherwise.

His grandfather [[Varqá|Mírzá `Alí-Muhammad Varqá]], from whom he received his name, was an [[Apostles of Bahá'u'lláh|Apostle of Bahá'u'lláh]], and his father, [[Valíyu'lláh Varqá]], was also a Hand of the Cause.&lt;ref name="bwns"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/579 | title = Baha'i world loses most distinguished member | date = 2007-09-24 | accessdate = 2007-09-24 | publisher= Baha'i World News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varqá moved to Paris and studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he obtained a [[doctorate]] in 1950. He then returned to Iran and taught at the universities of [[University of Tehran|Tehran]] and [[University of Tabriz|Tabriz]].  During this time, he also served in various [[Bahá'í administration|administrative]] capacities in the Bahá'í community of Iran.&lt;ref name="bwns" /&gt;

[[File:Shravanabelagola2007 - 13.jpg|thumb|Jain Śrāvaka praying at [[Gommateshwara statue]]]]
{{Jainism}}
In [[Jainism]], the word '''Śrāvaka''' is used to refer the Jain laity (householder).&lt;ref name=Udayana/&gt;{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=xiii}} The word ''śrāvaka'' has its roots in the word ''śrāvana'', i.e. the one who listens (the discourses of the saints).&lt;ref name=Udayana&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=d4VeYJdww2YC&amp;pg=PA423|title=Udayana|isbn=9788179751688|author1=Singh|first1=Abhay Kumar|last2=Arora|first2=Udai Prakash|date=2007-01-01|p=423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[tirthankara]]'' restores or organises the ''[[Jain community|sangha]]'', a fourfold order of ''muni'' (male monastics), ''aryika'' (female monastics), '' śrāvaka''s (male followers) and ''śrāvikā''s (female followers).{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2009|p =17}}

In Jainism, two kinds of votaries are there:-
*The householder (one with minor vows)
*The [[Jain monasticism|homeless ascetic]] (one with major vows)

According to [[Jain text]], ''[[Puruşārthasiddhyupāya]]'':{{quote|Ascetics who establish themselves in pure and absolute consciousness observe complete abstinence. Those who practice the path of partial abstinence are called Śrāvaka.|[[Puruşārthasiddhyupāya]] (41){{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=32}}}}

[[Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra]], a major [[Jain text]] discusses the conduct of a Śrāvaka in detail.

== Six essentials ==
[[File:Shravanbelgola prayer.jpg|thumb|A Jain Śrāvika worshiping]]
In Jainism, six essential duties (''avashyakas'') are prescribed for a ''śrāvaka''. These help the laity in achieving the principle of ahimsa which is necessary for his/her spiritual upliftment. The six duties are:{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=v}}
#Worship of [[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]] (five supreme beings).
#Following the preachings of Jain saints.
#Study of [[Jain scriptures]].
#''[[Sāmāyika]]'' (Vow of periodic concentration)
#Following discipline in their daily engagement
#Charity (''dāna'') of four kinds:{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=58}}
##''Ahara-dāna''- donation of food
##''Ausadha-dāna''- donation of medicine
##''Jnana-dāna''- donation of knowledge
##''Abhaya-dāna''- saving the life of a living being or giving of protection to someone under threat

== Twelve Vows ==
Jain ethical code prescribes five main vows and seven supplementary vows, which include three ''guņa vratas'' and four ''śikşā vratas''.{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=5}}

=== Anuvrata ===
{{Main|Ethics of Jainism}}

In Jainism, both [[Jain monasticism|ascetics]] and householders have to follow five vows (''vratas'') compulsorily. These five vows are:-
#[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahiṃsā]]- Not to hurt any living being by actions and thoughts. Out of the five types of living beings, a householder is forbidden to kill, or destroy, intentionally, all except the lowest (the one sensed, such as vegetables, herbs, cereals, etc., which are endowed with only the sense of touch).{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=79}}
#[[Satya]]- Not to lie or speak what is not commendable.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=61}}
#[[Asteya]]- Not to take anything if not given.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=68}}
#[[Brahmacharya]] ([[Chastity]]) - Refraining from indulgence in sex-passion.
#[[Aparigraha]] ([[Non-possession]])- Detachment from material property.

{{quote|One who observes the small vows is a householder|[[Tattvartha Sutra]] (101){{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=101}}}}

=== Guņa vratas ===

*''digvrata''- Restriction on movement with regard to directions.
*''bhogopabhogaparimana''- Vow of limiting consumable and non-consumable things
*''anartha-dandaviramana''- Refraining from harmful occupations and activities (purposeless sins).

=== Śikşā vratas ===
*''[[Samayika]]''- Vow to meditate and concentrate periodically.{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=5}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=88}} The ''sāmayika vrata'' (vow to meditate) is intended to be observed three times a day if possible; other-wise at least once daily. Its objective is to enable the ''śrāvaka'' to abstain from all kinds of sins during the period of time fixed for its observance. The usual duration of the ''sāmayika'' vow is an ''antara mūharta'' (a period of time not exceeding 48 minutes). {{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=44}} During this period, which the layman spends in study and meditation, he vows to refrain from the commission of the five kinds of sin — injury, falsehood, theft, unchastity and love of material possessions in any of the three ways. These three ways are:{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=27, 44}}- 
#by an act of mind, speech or body (''krita''), 
#inciting others to commit such an act (''kārita''),
#approving the commission of such an act by others (''anumodanā'').

In performing ''sāmayika'' the ''śrāvaka'' has to stand facing north or east and bow to the ''[[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]]''.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=44, 61}} He then sit down and recites the [[Namokara mantra]] a certain number of times, and finally devotes himself to holy meditation. ''Sāmayika'' can be performed anywhere- a temple, private residence, forest and the like. But the place shouldn't be open to disturbance of any kind.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=45}}

*''Desavrata''— Limiting movement to certain places for a fixed period of time.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=90}}
*''Upvas''— Fasting at regular intervals.
*''Atihti samvibhag''— Vow of offering food to the ascetic and needy people

A householder who observes these vows is called ''{{not a typo|viratavirata}}'', i.e., one who observes abstinence as well as non-abstinence.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=202}}
