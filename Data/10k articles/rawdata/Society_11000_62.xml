The '''Alfred P. Sloan Jr. Prize''' was a $250,000
award given by the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation for outstanding oncological research.&lt;ref name="Cancer Research 1999 pp. 1673s–1673s"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Laureates: General Motors Cancer Research Awards | journal=Cancer Research | volume=59 | issue=7 Supplement | date=1 March 1999 | issn=0008-5472 | pages=1673s | url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/59/7_Supplement/1673s | access-date=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The prize was awarded annually from 1979 to 2005. Of the winners, 15 out of 37 have gone on to win either a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] or a [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].

in 2006, due to budget constraints, the Alfred P. Sloan Jr. prize, the [[Kettering Prize|Charles K. Kettering]] prize, and the [[Charles S. Mott Prize]] were consolidated into a single General Motors Cancer Research Award which also had a value of $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=

'''Catherine Amelia Fay Ewing''' (née '''Catherine Amelia Fay'''; nickname, Aunt Katy; July 18, 1822 - April 4, 1897) was an American educator, missionary, philanthropist, activists, and social reformer from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Massachusetts]]. In 1857, she took in children from the [[Washington County, Ohio|Washington County]] Infirmary, thus organizing the first [[children's home]] in the state of [[Ohio]].{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}} 

Ewing taught school in Ohio before becoming a missionary among the [[Choctaw]]. Ten years later, upon her return to Ohio, she founded a home for destitute children. Through her efforts, the [[Ohio Legislature]] passed a bill in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], which entitled every county to establish a children's home. Ewing also authored a comprehensive historical report on the origin and growth of the children's home movement in Washington County.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=280-81}}

==Early life and education==
Catherine A. Fay was born in [[Westboro, Massachusetts]], July 18, 1822. Her parents, William (a veteran of the [[War of 1812]]){{sfn|MacGrath|Reed|1892|p=369}} and Elizabeth (Lankton) Fay,&lt;ref name="marietta.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Manuscripts|url=http://library.marietta.edu/spc/collections/manuscripts.html|publisher=Marietta College|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; lived comfortably. She was the seventh of eleven children, of whom all grew up and nine reached an advanced age.{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}} On her father's side, Ewing was descended from [[Huguenot]] ancestry. Through the mother's influence, the 12 children became Christians in early life. Ewing's mother was of Scotch descent, and in the long line of Christian ancestors, there were many ministers and missionaries.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=280-81}}

In 1835, the family removed to Washington County, Ohio, and settled {{convert|1|mile}} east of [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]], near [[Marietta College]]. The father came here both to aid the struggling college and to give his sons the benefit of its advantages.{{sfn|United States. Office of Education|1905|p=1309-10}} Ewing attended the Marietta Female Seminary,&lt;ref name="marietta.eduDiary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Catharine (Fay) Ewing Diary, Marietta College Library|url=http://library.marietta.edu/spc/FindingAids/Ewing%20-%20Catharine%20Fay%20Ewing%20Diary.pdf|publisher=Marietta College Library|accessdate=14 March 2017|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining in Marietta through her girlhood, even as her health began to decline.{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}}

==Career==
===Educator and missionary===
Ewing offered herself to the American Board for Foreign Mission work among the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who were at that time included in the field of the Board's activities. She was 18 when she left home and became a mission teacher among the [[Choctaw]], who had been removed in 1830 from their homes in the South to [[Indian Territory]]. Her salary as a teacher was US$100 a year plus her board. For 10 years, she labored among the Choctaw, much of the time the only non-Native American among them, living {{convert|40|miles}} beyond the nearest post office.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}} 

In the fall of 1853, while working as a missionary among the Choctaw, a physician called upon Ewing and asked her to visit a poor family where the mother, a [[New England]] woman, had died leaving five small children. They had been committed to his care, and he was trying to find homes for them, their drunken father having deserted them. The physician wanted Ewing to adopt a little girl who as two years old. She took the youngest for a little while, and became deeply attached to the child,{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}} but she felt the decision was impracticable as she was a poor teacher, hundreds of miles from home. The child was then taken by a married couple. Following a drunken fight, the child was thrown down the steps of the house and killed. This affected Ewing so deeply that she became determined to have a home of her own where she could care for orphan and homeless children. To achieve this objective, she began saving every dollar possible.{{sfn|United States. Office of Education|1905|p=1309-10}} Eventually, however, [[malaria]] and nervous exhaustion compelled her return to Marietta.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}}

===Philanthropist===
Her father, sympathizing with her purpose, assisted Ewing to some extent, so from these and other sources she gathered a modest amount from sympathetic friends, borrowed $150, till her resources amounted to $500. In 1857, she purchased {{convert|12|acres}} of land at [[Moss Run, Ohio|Moss Run]], about {{convert|15|miles}} east of Marietta, and set about building.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}}  Meanwhile, soon after her return from the missionary work, she had chanced to visit the county infirmary, and was drawn to the young children there, living in the same environment with adults. These children were often diseased and depraved, but she fell in love with them nonetheless, and determined to make for them a home. Many thought her crazy, others suspected a moneymaking scheme, some appreciated her motives and sacrifices and helped her.{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}} 

On 1 April, 1858, in a cottage of two rooms, she received from the County Poor House, nine children, all under 10 years of age. The county agreed to pay her $1.00 a week (''The Marietta Register'' said the sum was $0.75 a week) and half the expense of medical attendance and burial in case of death. Each child was to have a new suit of clothes when brought to her, but for all other needs she was herself to be responsible.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}} 
 
The first few weeks were very hard ones, the trustees of the district school refusing to allow the children to attend school because they were paupers, and they were unwilling to have their own children associate with them. After a lawsuit, she obtained permission to send them to school, but the children were taunted as poorhouse children.{{sfn|United States. Office of Education|1905|p=1309-10}} A few months later, before the ensuing winter, she moved into the new home with 20 rooms, and the first children’s home was an accomplished fact.{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}} Its cost was $2000, and in five years, $4000 had been expended on the property.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}} She also built her own school house and engaged a teacher.{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}} 

After the [[American Civil War]] broke out in 1861, many soldiers' children were added to her care. Her allowance for the increased cost of living was brought up to $1.25 a week and in response to her appeal for such children, the State opened at [[Xenia, Ohio]] a home for soldiers' orphans. For 10 years, she successfully managed the home and cared for 101 needy children of Washington County.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}} She faced problems of feeding and clothing so many, especially in war times, when prices went up and the attention of those who had helped her before was drawn away. There was also the issue of sickness when [[diphtheria]] and [[scarlet fever]] invaded the home.{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}}

===Activist===
But Ewing knew that the need of other counties was as great and some even greater. As early as 1862, she began an "agitation" for a State law in behalf of neglected children. She personally went to Columbus and pleaded with the Legislature.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}} In 1864, she conferred with the commissioners about the process at the state legislature to bring about this change. The bill was presented that year, but failed. In 1865, it was again presented and rejected.{{sfn|United States. Office of Education|1905|p=1309-10}} Finally in 1866, a bill prepared by Hon. Samuel S. Knowles of Washington County was passed, authorizing the county commissioners throughout the state to establish children's homes.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}} So the plan which she at first thought of only as a relief to her own Children's Home became in the course of time the means of creating homes in the different counties of the state.{{sfn|United States. Office of Education|1905|p=1309-10}} 

Washington County was one of the first to act under this law, and a farm of {{convert|100|acres}} was purchased for this purpose. When all was ready for the children's arrival, she was asked to take the superintendency of the home, in 1870. But she declined the offer as she had married by then.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}}

==Personal life==
In 1866, at the age of 44,&lt;ref name="marietta.eduDiary" /&gt; she married Archibald S. D. Ewing (1828-1900), who had been an adviser and assistant on her farm. After 1867, she lived quietly in Marietta, still active in good works. For many years, she taught the primary department of the Presbyterian Sunday School, and was “Aunt Katie” to a large part of the children and young people in the upper part of the city. She was interested in the temperance cause.{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}} 

Though the Ewings had no natural children, Mrs. Ewing had adopted five. She died April 4, 1897, leaving her property by will to the Missionary Society of the women of Marietta but this society had a temporary existence and had disbanded at the time of the death of her husband, so by direction of the Probate Court it was divided among her brothers and sisters and their heirs.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3103">'''Child labour in Namibia''' is not always reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200802010144.html allAfrica.com: Namibia: Child Labour in Namibia 'Must Be Tackled Head-On']&lt;/ref&gt; This involved cases of [[Prostitution of children|child prostitution]] as well as voluntary and forced agricultural labour, cattle herding and vending.

==Background==
Namibia ratified both the ILO [[Minimum Age Convention]] (C138) and the ILO [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] (C182) in 2000. In addition, the country also ratified the UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in 1990. Namibia signed the [[African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child]] in 1999, but has not ratified it as yet.

==Surveys==
According to the 1999 ''Namibian Child Activities Survey'' child labour exists in the country, predominantly in the agricultural sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uovs.ac.za/faculties/documents/06/003/MDS/DISSERTATIONS/L%20Nekundi%20791%20final.pdf Masters thesis by LM Nekundi]&lt;/ref&gt; The results of a follow-up survey conducted in December 2005 have not been made publicly available.

A 2013 [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) report indicates that particularly in livestock herding, child labour is prevalent in Namibia, and children work from a very young age, although the extent of the work varies per child. Additional hazards that arise from children herding animals are "disrupted physical, mental, moral and social development", the danger of being bitten, extreme weather conditions, and the infection with animal-borne diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Legislative intervention==
Between 2006 and 2008 the country has been in the process of formulating the ''Action Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour in Namibia'', which was nationally endorsed in February 2008. This was done with the assistance of the [[International Labour Organization]]'s (ILO) programme [[Towards the Elimination of the worst forms of Child Labour]]. A Programme Advisory Committee on Child Labour (PACC), representing government departments, organised labour and business, and civil society guides the development and implementation of the programme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="980">'''Consensual Living''', '''CL''', is a philosophy derived from the principles of [[consensus decision-making]] which advocates a consent-based approach to [[conflict resolution]]. 
The process of finding solutions in this model usually includes the [[communication]] of individual needs and the [[brainstorming]] of possible solution which will successfully address the needs of all parties, based on finding a [[Zero-sum game#Non-zero-sum|common preference]]. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.consensual-living.com/] Consensual Living Website&lt;/ref&gt;

CL adopts the democratic principle of equality by which the wants and needs of everyone involved are considered equally in the process of problem solving, regardless of an individual’s age or position. Because of this stance, CL is sometimes regarded as a parenting philosophy, where children are considered to have an equal say in family decision making.

'''Daniel Frederick Bakeman''' (October 9, 1759 – April 5, 1869) was the last survivor receiving a veteran's pension for service in the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783).

==Early life==
Bakeman said he was born on October 9, 1759 in [[Schoharie County, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilmore |first=George Clinton |date=1898 |title=Manchester Men: Soldiers and Sailors in the Civil War, 1861-'66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FxRAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA14 |location=Concord, NH |publisher=Rumford Press |page=16 |ref={{sfnRef|''Manchester Men''}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other sources indicate that he may have been born in northern [[New Jersey]], near the [[Delaware River]], and that his parents moved to the Schoharie County area when he was a boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Daughters of the American Revolution |date=1916 |title=Annual Report of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution |volume=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTIwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA67 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=US Government Printing Office |page=67 |ref={{sfnRef|''Daughters of the American Revolution''}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His parents were Dutch immigrants Andreas Phillip Bakeman &amp; Catarien Miller, and his name sometimes appears in written records as "Bochman".{{sfn|''Manchester Men''|page=16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ripstein-Hayes |first=Anita |date=2007 |title=Revolutionary Soldiers and Widows of Wyoming County, New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cYpAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22bakeman%22+%221869%22+%22sandusky+cemetery%22&amp;dq=%22bakeman%22+%221869%22+%22sandusky+cemetery%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiei-mi_dPZAhUmUt8KHV-5DT8Q6AEILDAB |location=Attica, NY |publisher=A. Ripstein-Hayes |page=36 |quote=Parents: Andreas Phillip Bakeman &amp; Catarien Miller. |ref={{sfnRef|''Revolutionary Soldiers and Widows of Wyoming County, New York''}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was baptized in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] on November 27, 1773.{{sfn|''Revolutionary Soldiers and Widows of Wyoming County, New York''|page=36}}

==American Revolution==
According to Bakeman's later testimony, during the [[American Revolution]], he served as a private in the [[Tryon County militia]] for the last four years of the war, and was a member of the company commanded by a captain named Van Arnum during the period when the county militia was commanded by [[Marinus Willett]].{{sfn|''Daughters of the American Revolution''|page=68}}  According to an obituary, Bakeman took part in the 1781 [[Battle of Johnstown]], and served as a teamster for the militia following his time in the ranks.{{sfn|''Daughters of the American Revolution''|page=68}}

Though no captain named Van Arnum or anything approximating it appears in the rolls of the Tryon County militia, and though no soldier named Bakeman or Bochman appears in the rolls, the descriptions Bakeman provided of his Revolutionary service in the pension application he submitted later in life were judged to be credible.{{sfn|''Daughters of the American Revolution''|page=68}}

==Post-war==
After the war, Bakeman farmed in the [[Mohawk Valley]].{{sfn|''Daughters of the American Revolution''|page=68}}  Back in 1772, he had married Susan Brewer, and they were the parents of eight children: Philip, Richard, Christopher, Betsey, Margaret, Susan, Mary, and Christine.{{sfn|''Daughters of the American Revolution''|page=68}}  Records show that in 1825 the Bakeman family settled in [[Arcade, New York]], where they owned a home on the north side of the County Line Road.{{sfn|''Daughters of the American Revolution''|page=68}}  In 1845 they moved to [[Freedom, New York]], and they later moved to [[Stark, New York|Stark]].{{sfn|''Daughters of the American Revolution''|page=68}}  Bakeman appeared in the [[1860 United States Census]] as "Frederick Bakeman" living in Freedom with his wife, his daughter Susan, and a grandchild, Jacob N. Bakeman (born 1838).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Daniel_Frederick_Bakeman_in_the_1860_census_in_Freedom,_New_York.jpg |title=Bakeman in the 1860 United States Census |year=1860 |accessdate=2015-02-23 |quote= |publisher= |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bakemans share the longest claimed marriage on record and also the only marriage claimed to have exceeded 90 years with a total of 91 years, 12 days.&lt;ref name="PreacherPollard"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://preacherpollard.com/2011/02/14/daniel-and-susan-bakeman/ |title=DANIEL AND SUSAN BAKEMAN |publisher=Preacherpollard's Blog |accessdate=February 17, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bakeman's later years, he was often called upon by local leaders to take part in important ceremonies, and on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] he was known to march around Freedom firing salutes with his musket.{{sfn|''Daughters of the American Revolution''|page=68}}

==Later life==
Bakeman was victimized by house fires at least three times in his life, including once while on a four-day trip from central New York to [[Albany, New York|Albany]] to buy wheat and other farm supplies.{{sfn|''Daughters of the American Revolution''|page=68}}  In the mid-1860s, he applied for a pension, and stated that the records of his service burned in one of his house fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berry |first1=AJ |last2=Morrison |first2=James F. |date=2011 |title=Don't Shoot Until You See The Whites of Their Eyes |volume=Part 1: Pension Applications |url=http://revwarny.com/book1.pdf |location=Seattle, WA |publisher=CreateSpace |page=14 |isbn=978-1-4610-6032-1 |ref={{sfnRef|''Don't Shoot''}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with many veterans who could not provide discharge certificates or other verifying documents, Bakeman's application included affidavits from friends and neighbors, who attested that he had a reputation for honesty, and that they had previously heard him describe his military service.{{sfn|''Don't Shoot''|pages=14-15}}  The testimony of these individuals and Bakeman's own affidavit were judged to be credible, and on February 14, 1867, the [[United States Congress]] passed a special act which granted Bakeman a pension of $500 per year.{{sfn|''Daughters of the American Revolution''|page=68}}  At the time, the longest surviving veterans who were on the pension rolls were [[Lemuel Cook]] of [[Clarendon, New York]] (died May 20, 1866), and Samuel Downing of [[Edinburgh, New York]] (died February 19, 1867).&lt;ref&gt;Reverend E.B. Hillard, ''The Last Men of the Revolution'' (1864), republished 1968 with additional notes by Wendell Garrett.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Fruits]] (died August 6, 1876) also claimed to be the last surviving veteran of the Revolutionary War, but he was never on the pension rolls, and research by [[A. Ross Eckler]]  in the 1970s indicated that Fruits was 17 years younger than he claimed, and was not a veteran of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McWhirter |first=Norris  |date=1978 |title=Guinness Book of World Records |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5a2AguFdd4C&amp;dq=George+Fruits+was+reputedly+a+veteran+of+the+American+Revolution%2C+born+in+Baltimore%2C+Maryland%2C+on+February+2%2C+1762%2C+who+died+on+August+6%2C+1876%2C+at+Alamo%2C+Indiana%2C+aged+114&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22George+Fruits%22 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Bantam Books |page=28 |quote=George Fruits was reputedly a veteran of the American Revolution, born in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 2, 1762, who died on August 6, 1876, at Alamo, Indiana, aged 114 years. However, new research, released by A. Ross Eckler in 1978, has shown him to be 17 years younger than the age shown on his gravestone.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and burial==
Bakeman died in Freedom on April 5, 1869 and is buried in Freedom's Sandusky Cemetery.{{sfn|''Revolutionary Soldiers and Widows of Wyoming County, New York''|page=36}}  The ''Annual Report'' of the U.S. Commissioner of Pensions for 1874 noted that "With the death of Daniel T. Bakeman, of Freedom, Cattaraugus County, N.Y., April 5, 1869, the last of the pensioned soldiers of the Revolution passed away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Bernard Heitman|title=Historical Register of Officers of the Continental Army During the War of the Revolution, April, 1775, to December, 1783|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ziRbtlUkBh0C|year=1892|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|isbn=978-0-8063-0176-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2315">'''Democratic journalism''' is a term describing a relatively new phenomenon where news stories are ranked by a vote among the stories' readers.&lt;ref&gt;Baase, Sara. A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and the Internet. 3. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2007. Page 351. {{ISBN|0-13-600848-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon has been brought about largely due to the creation of social networking sites such as [[Digg]] and [[Newsvine]].

The effect of democratic journalism is that it promotes news based on the popular opinion of the majority, or the "[[wisdom of the crowd]]". This differs from more traditional approaches, such as the one commonly used in the newspaper industry, where an editor would decide whether to print a particular news story. 

Some authors look at democratic journalism as taking in rights to free speech, assembly, human rights, the rule of law  and other mechanisms to check abuses. It also takes in civic conscionsness and social solidarity. Journalism then has a clear link with democracy, and is shaped accordingly. This would also have different meanings in First, Second and Third World nations. The democratic role of journalism should transcend excessive commercialism, sensationalism, and manipulation by media elites.&lt;ref&gt;Grave New World? Democratic Journalism Enters the Global Twenty-first Century 
Author: Berger G. Source: Journalism Studies, Volume 1, Number 1, 1 February 2000 , pp. 81-99(19) Publisher: Routledge, part of the Taylor &amp; Francis Group&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==

A common problem faced by democratic journalism is the unreliability and bias of the voting system used, which may not reflect the actual opinions of the majority. Many of the mediums which help enable democratic journalism suffer from problems such as gaming, [[bias]], [[censorship]], and lack of professional review. However, other approaches will also suffer from many of these problems. In order to get a set of news stories, at some point, something must decide one story's rank over another using some criteria. A different approach at making such a selection simply changes the source of the bias.

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of [[Chile]], including population density, [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[Economy of Chile|economic status]] and other aspects of the population.

Chile's 2002 census reported a population of 15,116,435 people.

Chile is a [[multiethnic society]],{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} home to people of many different ethnic backgrounds. Studies on the ethnic structure of [[Chile]] vary significantly from one another.

A public health book from the [[University of Chile]] (currently inaccessible) states that 65% of the population is of Caucasian origin; [[Castizos]]/Mestizos with an average 60% Caucasian ancestry and 40% Native American ancestry are estimated to amount a total of 30%, while Native Americans (Amerindians) comprise the remaining 5%.&lt;ref name="UC"&gt;{{cite web |title=5.2.6.

[[UNAM]] professor of [[Latin American]] studies, Francisco Lizcano, in his social research estimates that a predominant 52.7% of the Chilean population can be classified as [[European culture|culturally European]], with an estimated 44% as [[mestizos|Mestizo]].&lt;ref name="Lizcano"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcabJ98-t1wC&amp;pg=PA93|title=Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albeit this is an estimation based on cultural aspects. Other social studies put the total amount of [[White people|Whites]] at over 60 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Esteva-Fabregat |year=1988 |title=El mestizaje en lberoamérica |quote=a white majority that would exceed 60% of the Chilean population}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some publications, such as the [[CIA]] [[World Factbook]], state that the entire population consist of a combined 95.4% of "Whites and Mixed-Race people", and 4.6% of Amerindians. These figures are based on a national census held in 2002, which classified the population as indigenous and non-indigenous, rather than as White or Mestizo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html |title=CIA World Factbook: Chile |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the genetic considerations, many Chileans, if asked, would self-identify as white. However, a study performed in 2014 asked several Chileans about their ethnic self-classification, and then took a DNA test: 37.9% of the self-identified as white, yet the DNA tests showed that the average self identifying white was genetically only 74% European.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruiz-Linares|first=Andrés|last2=Adhikari|first2=Kaustubh|last3=Acuña-Alonzo|first3=Victor|last4=Quinto-Sanchez|first4=Mirsha|last5=Jaramillo|first5=Claudia|last6=Arias|first6=William|last7=Fuentes|first7=Macarena|last8=Pizarro|first8=María|last9=Everardo|first9=Paola|date=2014-09-25|title=Admixture in Latin America: Geographic Structure, Phenotypic Diversity and Self-Perception of Ancestry Based on 7,342 Individuals|url=https://figshare.com/articles/_Admixture_in_Latin_America_Geographic_Structure_Phenotypic_Diversity_and_Self_Perception_of_Ancestry_Based_on_7_342_Individuals_/1183040|journal=PLoS Genetics|language=en-US|volume=10|issue=9|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004572|pmc=4177621|pmid=25254375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 [[Latinobarómetro]] survey asked respondents in Chile what race they considered themselves to belong to. Most answered "white" (59%), while 25% said "mestizo" and 8% self-classified as "indigenous".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinobarometro.org/latino/LATContenidos.jsp Informe Latinobarómetro 2011], [[Latinobarómetro]].&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 national poll revealed that a majority of Chileans believed they possessed "some" (43.4%) or "much" (8.3%) indigenous blood, while 40.3% responded that they had none.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepchile.cl/enc_encuestas.html |title=Encuesta CEP, Julio 2002 |date=July 2002 |accessdate=May 18, 2012 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429001707/http://www.cepchile.cl/enc_encuestas.html |archivedate=April 29, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chile now is one of the two countries in [[Latin America]] with a positive migration rate.&lt;ref name="un2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/2006_MigrationRep/Profiles_country.pdf |title= United Nations Population Division |publisher=un.org|accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the principal immigrant groups correspond to the countries bordering Chile. [[Argentine]]s constitute the largest group, followed by Peruvians and the other top eight are [[Latin American]]. One of the main factors contributing to such immigration has been the growth of the [[Economy of Chile|Chilean economy]] during the past few decades. Immigration from other Latin American countries has also occurred, notably [[Venezuela]], [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Haiti]], contributed to develop Chile's small African descendant population.

According to the 2002 report of the [[International Organization for Migration]], more than 10,000 people from the United States have emigrated to Chile. Most of these arrived in Chile initially to work for multinational corporations. Most possess professional degrees, and most are well situated economically.

The [[Chilean Spanish|Spanish spoken in Chile]] is distinctively accented and quite unlike that of neighbouring South American countries because final syllables and "s" sounds are dropped, and some consonants have a soft pronunciation. Accent varies only very slightly from north to south; more noticeable are the small differences in accent based on social class or whether one lives in the city or the country. That the Chilean population was largely formed in a small section at the center of the country and then migrated in modest numbers to the north and south helps explain this relative lack of differentiation, which was maintained by the national reach of radio, and now television, which also helps to diffuse and homogenize colloquial expressions.&lt;ref name="countrystudies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm|title=Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830–1973|work=Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress|date=March 31, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several indigenous languages spoken in Chile: [[Mapudungun]], [[Chilean Quechua|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Rapa Nui language|Rapa Nui]]. After the Spanish invasion, Spanish took over as the [[lingua franca]] and the indigenous languages have become minority languages, with some now extinct or close to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CL|title=Languages of Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German is spoken to a great extent in southern Chile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oliver Zoellner |url=http://www.research-worldwide.de/article-chile2005.html |title=Oliver Zoellner &amp;#124; Generating Samples of Ethnic Minorities in Chile |publisher=Research-worldwide.de |date= |accessdate=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; either in small countryside pockets or as a second language among the communities of larger cities.

Through initiatives such as the [[English Opens Doors]] program, the government made English mandatory for students in fifth-grade and above in public schools. Most private schools in Chile start teaching English from kindergarten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/chile/090908/lack-english-proficiency |title=Repeat after me: Hello, my name is |publisher=Globalpost.com |date= |accessdate=May 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811114741/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/chile/090908/lack-english-proficiency |archivedate=August 11, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common English words have been absorbed and appropriated into everyday Spanish speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-04622005000200010&amp;script=sci_arttext |title=Anglicism in Chilean Spanish |publisher=Scielo.cl |date=May 4, 2004 |accessdate=May 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, all students from 3rd grade in secondary school have been tested on listening and reading comprehension in English.

In the most recent census (2002), 70 percent of the population over age 14 identified as [[Roman Catholic]] and 15.1 percent as [[evangelicalism|evangelical]]. In the census, the term "evangelical" referred to all non-Catholic Christian churches with the exception of the [[Orthodox Church]] (Arab, Greek, Persian, Serbian, Ukrainian, and Armenian), [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), [[Seventh-day Adventists]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. Approximately 90 percent of evangelicals are [[Pentecostal]]. [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyan]], [[Lutheran]], [[Reformed churches|Reformed Evangelical]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Anglican]], [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]], [[Baptist]] and [[Methodist church]]es are also present.&lt;ref name="religiousfreedomreport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108518.htm|title=Chile|work=International Religious Freedom Report|publisher=United States Department of State|date=September 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-religious people, atheists account for around 8% of the population.

==2012 Census==

According to the Chilean census held in 2012, the population of Chile was 16,634,603.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/americasview/2013/04/statistics-chile |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501014351/https://www.economist.com/blogs/americasview/2013/04/statistics-chile |archivedate=2013-05-01 |dead-url=yes |title=Statistics in Chile: How many Chileans? &amp;#124; The Economist|publisher=web.archive.org|accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methodology used for the census was questioned by advisors to the National Statistics Institute (INE), however, which led to an investigation and the resignation of its director, Francisco Labbé, in April 2013. At the same time, the Chilean government ruled out doing the census over again.&lt;ref name=econ /&gt;&lt;ref name="censo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censo.cl/|title=Censo 2017 - Todos Contamos|author=Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas - canales web 2015|publisher=censo.cl|accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Republic of Ireland]] had a population of 4,757,976 at the 2016 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/census/census2016reports/census2016preliminaryreport/|title=Census 2016 Preliminary Report - CSO - Central Statistics Office|website=www.cso.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographic history ==
[[File:Population of Ireland and Europe 1750 to 2005.svg|thumb|360px|A graph of the populations of the island of Ireland and Europe from 1750 to the present, showing Ireland's massive population spike in the early 19th century and subsequent collapse due to the 1845–49 famine and subsequent emigration.]]
The island of [[Ireland]], throughout most of its history, had a small population, comparable to that of other regions of similar area in [[Europe]]. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, Ireland experienced a major [[population boom]] as a result of the [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural]] and [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial]] Revolutions. In the 50-year period 1790-1840, the population of the island doubled from 4 million to 8 million. At its peak, Ireland's [[population density]] was similar to that of [[England]] and continental [[Europe]].

This changed dramatically with the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the mid-19th century, which led to mass starvation and consequent mass emigration. In the area covering the present day [[Republic of Ireland]], the population reached about 6.5 million in the mid 1840s. Ten years later it was down to 5 million. The population continued a slow decline well into the 20th century, with the Republic recording a low of 2.8 million in the 1961 census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.ie/-in-History/Population-of-Ireland-1841-2006.151.1.aspx Census.ie - Population of Ireland 1841 - 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227184211/http://www.census.ie/-in-History/Population-of-Ireland-1841-2006.151.1.aspx |date=27 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, the population started to grow once more, although slowly as [[emigration]] was still common. In the 1990s the country entered a period of rapid growth as a result of the [[Celtic Tiger]] Irish [[economic boom]]. [[Immigration]] began to far outweigh emigration. Many former Irish emigrants returned home, and the [[Republic of Ireland]] became an attractive destination for immigrants, mainly from [[Central Europe]], but also from Africa, Asia and elsewhere. However, with the 2008 onset of the [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|Irish economic and banking crisis]], the state's economy suffered, and since then the Republic of Ireland has once again been experiencing net emigration.

In November 2013, [[Eurostat]] reported that the republic had the largest net emigration rate of any member state, at 7.6 emigrants per 1,000 population. However, it has the youngest population of any European Union member state{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} and its population size is predicted to grow for many decades, in contrast with the declining population predicted for most European countries. A report published in 2008 predicted that the population would reach 6.7 million by 2060.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0826/population.html RTÉ News - ''Irish population to hit 6.7m by 2060'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic has also been experiencing a [[baby boom]], with increasing birth rates and overall fertility rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2008/08/28/story70956.asp Irish Examiner - ''Baby boom as Irish births reach highest level since 1982''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908004710/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2008/08/28/story70956.asp |date=8 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the total fertility rate is still below replacement depending on when the measurement is taken. The Irish fertility rate is still the highest of any European country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/37/59/40192107.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318225125/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/37/59/40192107.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase is significantly fuelled by non-Irish immigration – in 2009, a quarter of all children born in the Republic were born to mothers who had immigrated from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-has-highest-birth-rate-in-the-eu-2-164772-Jun2011/|title=Ireland has highest birth rate in the EU|first=Aoife|last=Barry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethnic groups and immigration ==
[[Gaelic culture]] and [[Irish language|language]] forms an important part of the Irish national identity.

The [[Irish Travellers]] are an indigenous minority ethnic group, formally recognised by the Irish State since March 1st 2017. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/travellers-formally-recognised-as-an-ethnic-minority-1.2994309|title=Travellers formally recognised as an ethnic minority|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Ireland had the highest birth rate (18.1 per 1,000), lowest death rate (6.1 per 1,000) and highest net-migration rate (14.1 per 1,000) in the entire European Union – and the largest population growth rate (4.4%) in the 27-member bloc as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/baby-boom-puts-us-on-top-of-birth-rate-league-1595151.html Irish Independent - ''Baby boom puts us on top of birth rate league'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland contains several immigrant communities, especially in [[Dublin]]. The most common foreign nationalities include Polish, British, Lithuanian, Latvian and Nigerian.

There is only genetic evidence for pre-[[Celts|Celt]]ic migration into Ireland.  The Irish people may therefore be described as strongly influenced by Celtic language and traditions but the Irish population is not mainly of Celtic origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://owlcation.com/stem/Irish-Blood-Genetic-Identity|title=Blood of the Irish:  What DNA Tells Us About the Ancestry of People in Ireland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dongolawi''' is a [[Nubian language]] of northern [[Sudan]]. It is spoken in the [[Nile Valley]], from roughly the 3rd cataract (south of [[Kerma]]) upstream to the bend in the Nile near [[ed Debba]]. With population displacement due to the [[Aswan High Dam]] there are communities of speakers in eastern [[Sudan]] ([[Khashm el Girba]]).{{cn|date=June 2015}}

''Dongolawi'' is an Arabic term based on the town of [[Old Dongola]], the centre of the historic Christian kingdom of [[Makuria]] (6th to 14th century). Today’s [[Dongola]] was founded during the 19th century on the western side of the Nile. The Dongolawi call their language '''Andaandi''' {{IPA-all|andaːndi|}} "(the language) of our home".

Nearly all Dongolawi speakers are also speakers of [[Sudanese Arabic]], the lingua franca of Sudan. Arabic&amp;ndash;Dongolawi bilingualism is replacive in the sense that Dongolawi is threatened by complete replacement by Arabic (Jakobi 2008). 

Dongolawi is closely related to [[Kenzi language|Kenzi]] (Mattokki), spoken in southern Egypt. They were once considered dialects of a single language, ''Kenzi-Dongolawi''. More recent research recognises them as distinct languages without a "particularly close genetic relationship."&lt;ref&gt;Bechhaus-Gerst, Marianne. ''The (Hi)story of Nobiin — 1000 Years of Language Change''. Peter Lang, 2011, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these two languages spoken along the Nile, three extinct varieties were included under Kenzi-Dongolawi.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

The '''Five Safes''' is a framework for helping make decisions about making effective use of data which is confidential or sensitive. It is mainly used to describe or design research access to statistical data held by government agencies, and by data archives such as the UK Data Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/use-data/secure-lab/security-philosophy|title=UK Data Service|website=www.ukdataservice.ac.uk|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the Five Safes refer to [[statistical disclosure control]] (SDC), and so the Five Safes is usually used to contrast statistical and non-statistical controls when comparing data management options.

== Concept ==
The Five Safes proposes that data management decisions be considered as solving problems in five 'dimensions': projects, people, settings, data and outputs. These are most commonly expressed as questions, for example:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desai|first=Tanvi|last2=Ritchie|first2=Felix|last3=Welpton|first3=Richard|year=2016|title=Five Safes: designing data access for research|url=http://www2.uwe.ac.uk/faculties/BBS/Documents/1601.pdf|journal=Bristol Business School Working Papers in Economics|volume=|pages=Footnote 1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/be4aa82cd8cf7f07ca2570d60018da27/e4d483bab4e1ad93ca257f4c00170bb6!OpenDocument|title=1015.0 - Information Paper: Transforming Statistics for the Future|last=|first=|date=2016|website=www.abs.gov.au|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|Safe data
|Is there a disclosure risk in the data itself?
|-
|Safe outputs
|Are the statistical results non-disclosive?
|}
These dimensions are scales, not limits. That is, solutions can have a mix of more or fewer controls in each dimension, but the overall solution is 'safe' independent of the particular mix. For example, a public use file available for open download cannot control who uses it, where or for what purpose, and so all the control (protection) must be in the data itself. In contrast, a file which is only accessed through a secure environment with certified users can contain very sensitive information: the non-statistical controls allow the data to be 'unsafe'. One academic likened the process to a graphic equalizer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McEachern|first=Steve|year=2015|title=Implementation of the Trusted Access Model|url=http://rsss.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/SMcEachern_researcherperspective_ASSANov2015.pdf|journal=Australian Data Archive|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where bass and treble can be combined independently to produce a sound the listener likes.

The Five Safes concept is associated with other topics which developed from the same programme at ONS, although these are not necessarily implemented. Safe people is associated with 'active researcher management',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.46/2009/wp.15.e.pdf|title=Effective Researcher Management|last=Desai|first=Tanvi|last2=Ritchie|first2=Felix|date=2009|website=www.unece.org|publisher=Eurostat|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; while safe outputs is linked with [[principles-based output statistical disclosure control]]. The Five Safes is associated with the 'Data Access Spectrum': as the non-data controls tend to work together, these are contrasted with data detail reduction to present a linear representation of data access options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gcoe.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/CAED/papers/id213_Ritchie.pdf |title=Designing a national model for data access|last=Ritchie|first=Felix|date=2008|work=Comparative Analysis of Enterprise (Micro)Data 2008 |access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and terminology ==
The Five Safes was devised in the winter of 2002/2003 by Felix Ritchie at the UK [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) to describe its secure remote-access Virtual Microdata Laboratory (VML).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritchie|first=Felix|year=2008|title=Secure access to confidential microdata: four years of the Virtual Microdata Laboratory|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/elmr/economic-and-labour-market-review/no--5--may-2008/secure-access-to-confidential-microdata--four-years-of-the-virtual-microdata-laboratory.pdf|journal=Economic and Labour Market Statistics|volume=2:5|pages=29–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described at this time as the 'VML Security Model'. This was adopted by the [[NORC at the University of Chicago|NORC]] data enclave,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lane|first=Julia|authorlink=Julia Lane|last2=Bowie|first2=Chet|last3=Scheuren|first3=Fritz|last4=Mulcahy|first4=Tim|year=2009|title=NORC Data Enclave:Providing Secure Remote Access to Sensitive Microdata|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/1001617/4398365/S02P1-NORC-DATA-ENCLAVE-SCHEUREN.ppt|journal=UNECE/EU Workshop on statistical confidentiality 2009|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more widely in the US, as the 'portfolio model' (although this is now also used to refer to a slightly different legal/statistical/educational breakdown).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lane|first=Julia|last2=Heus|first2=Pascal|last3=Mulcahy|first3=Tim|year=2008|title=Data Access in a Cyber World: Making Use of Cyberinfrastructure|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ce88/76858c14560afd6d8bd3e8bcae8425d33cab.pdf|journal=Transactions in Data Privacy|volume=|pages=2–16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the framework as was still being referred to as the 'VML security model',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Felix|first=Ritchie,|date=2013-01-01|title=International access to restricted data: A principles-based standards approach|url=http://www.medra.org/servlet/aliasResolver?alias=iospress&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=1874-7655&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=289&amp;doi=10.3233/SJI-130780|journal=Statistical Journal of the IAOS|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|doi=10.3233/sji-130780|issn=1874-7655}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its increasing use among non-UK organisations led to the adoption of the more general and informative phrase 'Five Safes'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The original framework only had four safes (projects, people, settings and outputs): the framework was used to describe highly detailed data access through a secure environment, and so the 'data' dimension was irrelevant. From 2007 onwards, 'safe data' was included as the framework was used to a describe a wider range of ONS activities. As the US version was based upon the 2005 specification, some US iterations uses have the original four dimensions (eg&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

Some discussions, such as the OECD,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/std/microdata-access-final-report-OECD-2014.pdf|title=OECD Expert Group For International Collaboration On Microdata Access,  Chapter 6. Standardised Application Process For Microdata Access|last=Volkow|first=Natalia|date=|website=www.oecd.org|publisher=OECD|pages=73–79|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; use the term 'secure' instead 'safe'.

== Application ==
The framework has had three uses: pedagogical, descriptive, and design. The latter is a relatively recent development.

=== Pedagogy ===
The first significant use of the framework, other than internal administrative use, was to structure researcher training courses at the UK Office for National Statistics from 2003. [[UK Data Archive]], [[Administrative Data Research Network]], [[Eurostat]], [[Statistics New Zealand]], the Mexican [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Mexico)|National Institute of Statistics and Geography]], [[NORC at the University of Chicago|NORC]] and the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], amongst others, have also used this framework. Most of these courses are for researchers using restricted-access facilities; the Eurostat courses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/microdata/overview/self-study-material-for-microdata-users|title=Self-study material for the users of European microdatasets|last=|first=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu|publisher=European Commission|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; are unusual in that they are designed for all users of sensitive data.

=== Description ===
The framework is often used to describe existing data access solutions (e.g. UK [[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]] Data Lab,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slideserve.com/stephen-hester/the-hmrc-datalab|title=The HMRC Datalab|last=Hawkins|first=Mike|date=2011|website=slideserve.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK Data Service,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Statistics New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.46/2013/Topic_3_NZ.pdf|title=Confidentiality for integrated data|last=Camden|first=Mike|date=2011|website=www.unece.org|publisher=Eurostat|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or planned/conceptualised ones (e.g. Eurostat in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.46/2011/43_Eurostat.pdf|title=The Future of Access to European Confidential Data for Scientific Purposes|last=Bujnowska|first=Aleksandra|last2=Museux|first2=Jean-Marc|date=2011|website=www.unece.org|publisher=Eurostat|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;). An early use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritchie|first=Felix|year=2005|title=Access to business microdata in the UK: dealing with the irreducible risks|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.46/2005/wp.29.e.pdf|journal=UNECE/Eurostat Workshop on Statistical Data Confidentiality 2005|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to help identify areas where ONS' still had 'irrreducible risks' in its provision of secure remote access.

The framework is mostly used for confidential social science data. To date it appears to have made little impact on medical research planning,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Elizabeth|year=2015|others=et al|title=Enabling data linkage to maximise the value of public health research data|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/stellent/groups/corporatesite/@policy_communications/documents/web_document/wtp059017.pdf|journal=Public Health Research Data Forum Commissioned Reports|publisher=Wellcome Trust|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is now included in the revised guidelines on implementing [[HIPAA]] regulations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18614|title=Proposed Revisions to the Common Rule for the Protection of Human Subjects in the Behavioral and Social Sciences|last=Council|first=National Research|date=2014-01-09|isbn=9780309298063|language=en|doi=10.17226/18614}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, and by Cancer Research UK and the [[Health Foundation]] in the UK.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/media/604145/19_5safes_safesettings_wolters.pdf|title=Governance and the HSCIC's IG toolkit|last=Wolters|first=Arne|date=2015|website=ukdataservice.ac.uk|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used to describe a security model for the Scottish Health Informatics Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rss.org.uk/uploadedfiles/userfiles/files/Frank-Sullivan-linkage.ppt|title=The Scottish Health Informatics Programme|last=Sullivan|first=Frank|date=|website=www.rss.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design ===
In general the Five Safes has been used to describe solutions post-factum, and to explain/justify choices made, but an increasing number of organisations have used the framework to design data access solutions. For example, the Hellenic Statistical Agency developed a data strategy built around the Five Safes in 2016; the UK Health Foundation used the Five Safes to design its data management and training programmes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The major design use is in Australia: both the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Department of Social Service used the Five Safes as an ex ante design tool.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/31874/|title=Department of Social Services data access project final report. Project Report |last=Green |first=Elizabeth |date=2016|work=|access-date=|last2=Ritchie|first2=Felix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017 the Australian Productivity Commission recommended&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/data-access/report|title=Data Availability and Use: Australian Productivity Commission Inquiry Report|last=|first=|publisher=Productivity Commission |year=2017|isbn=978-1-74037-617-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopting a version of the framework to support cross-government data sharing and re-use.

In 2015 the UK Data Service organized a workshop&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/news-and-events/eventsitem/?id=4058|title=The 5 safes of access to confidential data |last=|first=|date=|website=www.ukdataservice.ac.uk|publisher=UK Data Service|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to encourage data users from the academic and private sectors to think about how to manage confidential research data, using the Five Safes to demonstrate alternative options and best practice.

Two laws have incorporated the Fives Safes: explicitly in the South Australian [https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/PUBLIC%20SECTOR%20(DATA%20SHARING)%20ACT%202016.aspx Public Sector (Data Sharing) Act 2016], implicitly in the research provisions of the [[Digital Economy Act 2017|Digital Economy Act]].

== Public engagement ==
The UK Data Service has produced a blog&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.ukdataservice.ac.uk/access-to-sensitive-data-for-research-the-5-safes/|title=Access to sensitive data for research: the five safes|last=Welpton|first=Richard|last2=Corti|first2=Louise|date=|website=blog.ukdataservice.ac.ukpublisher=UK Data Service|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and video&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mln9T52mwj0|title=Five Safes video|last=|first=|date=|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=UK Data Service|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the general public about the use of Five Safes in re-using administrative data.

'''Bishop G. B. Devasahayam''' ''(born 23 August 1925; died 20 August 1996)&lt;ref name="Hindu"&gt;''[[The Hindu]]'', Hyderabad Edition, ''Death Anniversaries'' August 20, 2016, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;'' was the second&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; elected [[Church of South India|CSI]]-Bishop - in - [[Karimnagar Diocese of the Church of South India]] who occupied the ''[[Cathedra]]'' from 1982 through 1987&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; placed in the [[Church of South India|CSI]]-Wesley Cathedral in [[Karimnagar]] Town in [[Telangana]], [[India]]

Devasahayam hailed from the [[Protestant]] [[Church of South India|CSI]]-[[Diocese of Medak]] which was predominantly a [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyan Methodist]] congregation initiated by the [[English Wesleyan Mission|Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society]]&lt;ref&gt;P.

After Devasahayam discerned his avocation towards priesthood, then Bishop, [[Frank Whittaker]] sent him to the [[Protestant]] Regional Theologiate in [[Bangalore]] for ministerial formation during 1952-1956 after which Devasahayam was ordained and began ministering in the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the [[Diocese of Medak]] during the successive bishoprics of [[Frank Whittaker]], [[Eber Priestley]], [[H. D. L. Abraham]] and [[B. G. Prasada Rao]].  After nearly 25 years of pastoral ministry, Devasahayam contested the bishopric in the adjoining [[Diocese of Karimnagar]] and was declared elected by the [[Church of South India Synod]] resulting in his appointment as the second&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; [[Church of South India|CSI]]-[[Bishop]] - in - [[Karimnagar Diocese|Karimnagar]] where he began his bishopric from 1982&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; and continued to build up the ministry and evangelism&lt;ref name="Surya"&gt;[[P.

Prabhudass]].&lt;ref name="Surya"/&gt;

In 1987,&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; after shepherding the bishopric for nearly six years, Devasahayam announced his resignation from the ecclesiastical office of the Bishop citing health reasons and vacated the ''[[Cathedra]]'' resulting in ''[[sede vacante]]''.  The sudden turn of events took the ecclesiastical circles by storm making the [[Church of South India Synod]] led by Moderator [[I. Jesudason]]&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; and Deputy Moderator [[Victor Premasagar|P. Victor Premasagar]]&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; to huddle and take steps to fill the ''[[sede vacante]]'' caused by the resignation of Devasahayam.

The UGC took the opinion that the Senate fell under the purview of Section 2 (f) of the said Act since ''The Serampore College Act, 1918'' was passed by the Government of West Bengal.&lt;/ref&gt; with degree-granting authority validated by a Danish Charter and ratified by the [[Government of West Bengal]].

After a 4-year ministerial formation at the [[Protestant]] Regional Theologiate in [[Bangalore]] during 1952-1956,&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt; Devasahayam was ordained as a [[Pastor]] by [[Frank Whittaker]], the first [[Church of South India|CSI]]-[[Bishop]] - in - [[Medak Diocese|Medak]] following which he began to minister parishes in the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the [[Diocese of Medak]] pastoring in [[Secunderabad]], [[Nizamabad, Telangana|Nizamabad]], Dudgaon in Telangana region of the erstwhile [[Andhra Pradesh]] state.

===Bishopric===
In 1982&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; when the first [[Church of South India|CSI]]-[[Bishop]] - in - [[Karimnagar Diocese|Karimnagar]], [[B. Prabhudass]] vacated the ''[[Cathedra]]'' on attaining superannuation, the [[Church of South India Synod]] announced the conduction of fresh elections to fill in the ''[[sede vacante]]'', following which Devasahayam from the adjoining [[Diocese of Medak]] was declared elected and appointed to the bishopric leading to his consecration in 1982 by [[I. Jesudasan]] then Moderator of the [[Church of South India Synod]] who principally consecrated Devasahayam as [[Church of South India|CSI]]-[[Bishop]] - in - [[Karimnagar Diocese|Karimnagar]] in the presence of Sundar Clarke, the Deputy Moderator and co-consecrator.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt;

As Bishop, Devasahayam took part in the biennial conclaves of the [[Church of South India Synod]]s of 1984 and 1986 held at [[Secunderabad]] and [[Trivandrum]] respectively.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt;

In 1987,&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; Devasahayam vacated the Bishopric on account of health reasons resulting in an unexpected ''[[sede vacante]]'' very much similar to the present papacy of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] who resigned citing health reasons in 2013.  The [[Church of South India Synod]] filled the ''[[sede vacante]]'' by announcing the appointment of [[K. E. Swamidass]], who incidentally was a companion of Devasahayam during his seminary studies in Bangalore.&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt;

==Governor==
As [[Church of South India|CSI]]-[[Bishop]] - in - [[Karimnagar Diocese|Karimnagar]], Devasahayam was ''[[ex officio]]'' member of the Board of Governors of the near-[[ecumenical]] [[Andhra Christian Theological College]], a [[Protestant]] Regional Theologiate situated in [[Hyderabad]] comprising a few [[Protestant]] societies, the [[Wesleyans]], [[Methodists]], [[Lutherans]], [[Baptists]], [[Congregationalists]], and the [[Anglicans]].  Devasahayam represented the [[Karimnagar Diocese]] which was again a [[Wesleyan]] congregation from 1982 through 1987 on the Board of Governors coinciding with the successive cycle of Principalships held by [[Convention of Baptist Churches of Northern Circars]] and the [[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches]] led by [[Reverend|The Rev.]] K. David, [[Ph.D.]] ([[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]]) and [[Reverend|The Rev.]] [[Suppogu Joseph|S. Joseph]], [[D.Th.]] ([[Senate of Serampore College (University)|Serampore]]) respectively.

==Retirement and death==
After Devasahayam sought early retirement from the bishopric in 1987&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; on account of health reasons,&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; he returned to the [[Diocese of Medak]] and resided in [[Secunderabad]].  In 1992&lt;ref name="NCCI"/&gt; Devasahayam took part in the consecration of the [[Old Testament]] Scholar [[S. John Theodore]] as the fourth [[Church of South India|CSI]]-[[Bishop]] - in - [[Karimnagar Diocese|Karimnagar]] along with his predecessor [[B. Prabhudass]] as well as [[K. E. Swamidass]] his successor.&lt;ref name="NCCI"&gt;''National Council of Churches Review'', Volume 113, National Christian Council of India, 1993, p.193.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=PgrZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=t.b.d.prakasa+rao&amp;dq=t.b.d.prakasa+rao&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisyr7KtbHKAhVSHo4KHaPHBo8Q6AEIGzAA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Devasahayam continued to minister in the [[Diocese of Medak]] until his death on 20 August 1996.&lt;ref name="Hindu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43390">[[Human trafficking]] in Argentina is the illegal trade in persons for purposes of reproductive slavery, [[sexual exploitation]], [[forced labor]], organ removal, or any form of modern [[slavery]].

It is an international crime against humanity and a violates human rights. It is considered a modern form of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acnur.org/secciones/index.php?viewCat=1121|title=404|author=|date=|website=ACNUR: La Agencia de la ONU para los Refugiados|access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acnur.org/t3/que-hace/proteccion/trata-y-trafico-de-personas/|title=Trata y tráfico de personas|trans-title=|language=|author=|date=|website=ACNUR: La Agencia de la ONU para los Refugiados|access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esclavosenEuropa"&gt;[http://www.monde-diplomatique.es/?url=editorial/0000856412872168186811102294251000/editorial/?articulo=e12ea20f-b219-4659-a8e5-daff3436763a Esclavos en Europa], [[Ignacio Ramonet]], [[Le Monde diplomatique]], Nº: 189 Julio 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide it is ranked third among felony crimes, behind arms and drugs trafficking.

It also encourages countries to cooperate among themselves to achieve these objectives.

In Argentina this crime is punishable by law.  There are many laws that cover this problem, but the crime continues to occur. An important legal development in this area was the enactment of law number 26.364,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acnur.org/t3/fileadmin/scripts/doc.php?file=biblioteca/pdf/6314|title=Law number 26.364|author=|date=|website=acnur.org|access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tries to achieve what this international protocol seeks&lt;ref name="Ley"&gt;{{Cite web|title=PREVENCIÓN Y SANCIÓN DE LA TRATA DE PERSONAS Y ASISTENCIA A SUS  VÍCTIMAS|url=http://www.acnur.org/t3/fileadmin/scripts/doc.php?file=biblioteca/pdf/6314|language=Spanish |trans-title=Prevention and punishment of trafficking and assistance for its victims|access-date=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provides penalties of 3 to 15 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cristina promulgó la ley sobre Trata de Personas|url=http://www.argentina.ar/_es/pais/C8426-cristina-promulgo-la-ley-sobre-trata-de-personas.php|language=Spanish |trans-title=(President) Christina promulgates a law over trafficking in persons|date=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being a serious felony, in Argentina there are no official statistics on this crime, only for cases prosecuted. But it is known that the country is a source, transit and destination for trafficking.&lt;ref name="infopico"/&gt; As a means of preventing trafficking, in July 2011 the government issued an order that banned the publication of explicit advertisements of sexual solicitation in the newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Los avisos de oferta de sexo|url=http://www.diariodecuyo.com.ar/home/new_noticia.php?noticia_id=468915|accessdate=July 16, 2011|author=Diario de Cuyo|language=Spanish |trans-title=Want ads for sex|date=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from 2012 showed that trafficking for sexual exploitation is changing to evade the law, by allowing exploited women to keep their identification documents or allowing them to leave the location of exploitation, to make the trafficking more difficult to prove.&lt;ref name="pagina12"/&gt;

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in "Tier 2" in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic elements of trafficking ==
# '' "Recruitment"''; this can be by deception or by force, and involves a recruiter.
# '' "Transport"''; from here to the site of exploitation, the victim is subjected to [[coercion]].  Transfer may be between regions or other countries. Colluding in this process are transporters, corrupt officials, and intermediaries to the trafficking.
# The'' "operation"''; here the victim is subjected to exploitation by the [[pimp]] or the operator, who takes a totally illegal right of [[property]] over the victim.&lt;ref Name="UNICEF"/&gt;

== Federal legislation ==
There are many laws that touch on the theme of trafficking; historically the Ley Palacios of 1913 was the first law in the protection to protect victims of sexual exploitation and slavery, as well as to punish those responsible. It was the first legislation in the entire American continent and signified a great advance in human rights in the country. The [[International Day Against Human Trafficking]] commemorates the enactment of this law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argentina.ar/_es/pais/C2458-dia-internacional-contra-la-trata-de-personas.php Día Internacional contra la Trata de Personas] [Argentina.com.ar], AEN. 25 de Septiembre de 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentina, as a signatory to the United Nations [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]], on April 29, 2008 passed Law 26.364 for the Prevention and Punishment of Trafficking in Persons and Assistance to its Victims. According to the dictates of international protocol and emphasizing care and rights of victims and differentiating between adults and minors. It is in accordance with the codes of international protocol and places emphasis on assistance and rights of victims and their differentiation between adults and minors.

* Law 26.364 defines trafficking as:&lt;ref name=OIM/&gt;
{{blockquote|La captación, el transporte y/o traslado — ya sea dentro del país, desde o hacia el exterior—, la acogida o la recepción de personas mayores de dieciocho (18) años de edad, con fines de explotación, cuando mediare engaño, fraude, violencia, amenaza o cualquier medio de intimidación

* Victims can not be punished for committing any offense that is a direct result of being trafficked. In the case of foreigners, no sanctions are applied nor can their contracts be voided because of infractions of immigration legislation if the violations are due trafficking.&lt;ref name=Ufase&gt;{{Cite web|title=Oficina de Rescate y Acompañamiento a Personas Damnificadas por el Delito de Trata de Personas|url=http://www.jus.gob.ar/areas-tematicas/trata-de-personas.aspx|language=Spanish |trans-title=Rescue and Support Office for People Harmed by the Crime of Trafficking in Persons|access-date=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* This law sets criminal and procedural rules, with penalties of 3–6 years in the case of trafficking of adults and 4 to 10 years if there are aggravating circumstances such as:&lt;ref name=ley&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asapmi.org.ar/publicaciones/legislacion/articulo.asp?id=451|title=Ley 26.364 - Prevención y Sanción de la Trata de Personas y Asistencia a sus Víctimas.|trans-title=|language=|author=|date=|website=www.Asapmi.org.ar|access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The person who commits the crime is parent or grandparent, spouse, related in a direct line, brother, guardian, person living, tutor, in charge of education or a caretaker, minister of any religion recognized or not, or public official;
# The act was committed by three or more people in an organized manner;
# There were three or more victims.

== Victims ==
Trafficking generates victims who in the majority of cases live under inhuman conditions; to be a victim of trafficking involves slavery, in which the trafficker gains a totally illegal right of property right over the victim or reduces her to the level of indentured servitude for the purpose of economic exploitation. In Argentina the most common victims of forced labor are in underground sweatshops are textile or as farm laborers and in other cases domestic workers. As for sexual exploitation that principally affects women, adolescents, and children, they are mostly found in the country's brothels.&lt;ref name="infopico"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Trata de personas, Argentina es lugar de origen, de tránsito y de destino|url=http://www.infopico.com/social/4864-trata-de-personas-argentina-es-lugar-de-origen-de-transito-y-de-destino|language=Spanish|trans-title=Trafficking in persons, Argentina is location of transit and destination|access-date=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;{{Cite web|title=¿De qué se trata la  de niños, niñas  y adolescentes?|url=http://www.unicef.org/argentina/spanish/FolletoTrata(final).pdf|author=[[Unicef]]|language=Spanish |trans-title=What about trafficking in girls, boys, and adolescents?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forced labor ===
Forced labor includes a variety of trades, but the sectors most affected are rural and textile labor.

==== Textile industry ====
According to the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC – Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos), unregistered labor in apparel approaches 75%. The greater number of these workers are black, which promotes the spread of forced labor. According to Gustavo Vera, president of the cooperative La Alameda (which represents and defends textile workers), "We know that there are about 3,000 underground sweatshops in the Federal Capital" and he adds "There are also some 15,000 underground sweatshops in the first tier of the Buenos Aires suburbs and several thousand more in Greater Buenos Aires, Rosario, Mendoza and Cordoba. These workshops include a population of about 200,000 people who are reduced to forced labor or slave labor, which is the same as forced labor but worse, because the will of the workers is controlled 24 hours a day by the employer." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Autoridades argentinas investigan fábricas textiles ilegales |url=http://infosurhoy.com/cocoon/saii/xhtml/es/features/saii/features/main/2010/06/10/feature-02 |author=Ezequiel Vinacour |work=Infosurhoy.com |language=Spanish |trans-title=Argentine authorities investigate illegal textile factories |date=June 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210085616/http://infosurhoy.com/cocoon/saii/xhtml/es/features/saii/features/main/2010/06/10/feature-02 |archivedate=December 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]], Argentina is classified among the 74 countries in which [[child labor]] and [[forced labor]] is still practiced today. The Bureau's ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/|title=List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor|author=|date=|website=DOL.gov|access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentions "garments" as one of 11 other products in Argentina. Furthermore, in one of its reports on the worst forms of child labor, The [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] states that "Argentina has not adopted a list of hazardous occupations that are prohibited to children, and appears to lack programs that target working children in all relevant sectors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/argentina.htm|title=Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Argentina|author=|date=30 September 2016|website=DOL.gov|access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rural ====
In Argentina, one of the first protections of the farm laborer was born in 1940 with the enactment of the Estatuto del Peón &lt;nowiki&gt;[Statute of farm laborers]&lt;/nowiki&gt; which gave wage laborers (jornaleros) all the rights of workers (trabajadores). Later, complementary laws were added. The government of Cristina Kirchner signed the conventions of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) prohibiting the forced recruitment of manual labor for the rural labor force. However, there still exist recruiting networks that through deception or physical coercion recruit people who are typically in a vulnerable situation. And they are recruited from marginal rural areas of Santiago del Estero, Chaco, Tucuman, Catamarca and Jujuy and from migrant workers from bordering countries such as Chile, Bolivia, and Paraguay. And then they are taken to areas where they do hard labor and live in subhuman conditions. These situations violate the [[American Convention on Human Rights|Protocol of San Salvador]] treaty and [[Safety and Health in Agriculture Convention, 2001|International Labour Conference Convention 184]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Trabajo forzado en el mundo agrario: una cara oculta del bicentenario argentino|url=http://www.pacarinadelsur.com/home/abordajes-y-contiendas/282-trabajo-forzado-en-el-mundo-agrario-una-cara-oculta-del-bicentenario-argentino|author=Daniel Cieza (Catedrático de las Universidades de Buenos Aires y La Plata|language=Spanish |trans-title=Forced labor in the agrarian world: a dark face of the Argentine bicentennial )}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual abuse ===

==== History ====
Sexual exploitation was born in the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] before the country was even created.&lt;ref name=historia&gt;{{Cite web|title=HISTORIA DE LA TRATA DE PERSONAS EN ARGENTINA COMO  PERSISTENCIA DE LA ESCLAVITUD.|url=http://www.mseg.gba.gov.ar/Trata/HISTORIA.pdf|author=Dr. Raúl A. Schnabel|work=Dirección General de Registro de Personas Desaparecidas|language=Spanish |trans-title=History of the trafficking of persons in Argentina as persistence of slavery}}&lt;/ref&gt; After independence in 1875, a law was made regulating prostitution, preventing prostitution of minors, but allowing it if the children were initiated early into this activity.

In the late nineteenth century "white slavery" rings were established that provided women from Central Europe and Russia, who were sold in a sham marriage to a ruffian. They sought to escape poverty and religious persecution that they suffered. And in this country they were forced into prostitution or sold to another pimp.&lt;ref name=historia/&gt; In the early twentieth century, these trafficking organizations tightened their ties with power. This was in order to be protected by law or to avoid problems in case of breaking laws or deception. Because of their great accumulation of wealth through "kickbacks", they accomplished their mission.&lt;ref name=historia/&gt; Among the customers it is possible to highlight periods of intense European migration that brought primarily single men as main consumers of trafficking, although upper middle class Argentinians also had a high level use of prostitution. By the early twentieth century there were two major international trafficking rings.

MILIEU, a trafficking organization of French origin, and La Migdal, or [[Zwi Migdal]], of Jewish origin, formerly called the Varsovia (Warsaw) Jewish Mutual Aid Society – This last organization came to an end in 1929 when [[Raquel Liberman]], one of thousands of Polish immigrants enslaved in brothels, reported Zwi Migdal to the authorities.&lt;ref name="clarin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2004/03/13/s-05901.htm|title=Zwi Migdal: filman la historia de la mafia polaca en la Argentina|first=|last=Clarin.com|date=|website=www.Clarin.com|access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint was taken by a judge, Manuel Rodriguez Ocampo. Especially since another 150 previous complaints were not successful either because of violence against the accusers or police and judicial corruption. This trial against the organization made it possible to make public the treatment suffered by victims.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt;

After several periods of closure and opening of brothels, from June 24, 1965, Law 16.666 was put into effect that the practice of prostitution is open and not subject to any form of regulation, this law is in effect to the present day.

In practice, this criminal activity is organized on a grand scale and is frequently associated with the [[illegal drug trade]] and with [[arms trafficking]]. Much of this crime is organized on a global level.

==== Current status ====
At present, Argentina is a source, transit, and destination location for trafficking, which means that the victims can be Argentinian or from other countries, that they go through this country, and that some have this as the destination to be illegally exploited.&lt;ref name="infopico"/&gt;

"Reclutadores" (recruiters) capture the victims through deception or abduction, assisted by "marcadores" (markers) who pick the victims. Then the circle closes with the "proxenetas" ([[pimp]]s) who get their profit from the sexual exploitation of victims. And finally the "regentes" (managers) or madames of brothels. There are also carriers and secondary dealers concerned with protecting this whole criminal system. In some cases there is some kind of collusion between members of the police, judges, and politicians.&lt;ref name="lanacion"/&gt;

The province of the country in which the most women are recruited is Entre Rios, followed by Misiones, Corrientes, Chaco, Santa Fe and Tucuman; usually victims are rotated through brothels across the whole country. The list of destinations includes Buenos Aires and Cordoba, at the head of the list of destinations chosen by the rings, along with La Pampa, Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego. There are also links to international rings, especially the route to Spain,&lt;ref name="santa rosa"&gt;{{Cite web|title=TRATA DE MUJERES EN ARGENTINA |trans-title=| language=Spanish | url=http://santarosa.gov.ar/genero/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56:trata-de-mujeres-en-argentina&amp;catid=46:articulos-recomendados&amp;Itemid=72 |author=Paloma Bazan |work=SantaRosa.gov.ar |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310135130/http://santarosa.gov.ar/genero/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56%3Atrata-de-mujeres-en-argentina&amp;catid=46%3Aarticulos-recomendados&amp;Itemid=72 |archivedate=2012-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where young Tucuman women were rescued.&lt;ref name="lanacion"/&gt;

==== Recruitment ====
There are many recruiting methods but all are either "soft", based on fraud and deception, or "hard", based directly on kidnapping the victims.

*Kidnapping: in this crime women are identified and marked. Later they are kidnapped from off the street, they are drugged and transported to a place where they are repeatedly violated for the purpose of sexually exploiting them later. Those who offer resistance are threatened with harming or killing her family.&lt;ref name="santa rosa"/&gt;
*Deception: in which recruiters take advantage of the poverty or defenselessness of the victim with false offers of employment, moving the victim to another province or country, after which she finds she is to be sexually exploited.&lt;ref name="santa rosa"/&gt;

There are also cases in which the victim has agreed to work in the sex trade, but then finds out the working and living conditions fall within the category of trafficking. Sometimes these victims only recognize the exploitation after intensive psychological assistance.&lt;ref name=infopico/&gt;&lt;ref name=notio&gt;{{Cite web|author=Joaquín Garau |title=¿Cómo es la Argentina de la Trata de Personas? |url=http://notio.com.ar/tus-notas/como-es-la-argentina-de-la-trata-de-personas-2509 |language=Spanish |trans-title=How is Argentina with regard to trafficking in persons: |date=October 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105223145/http://notio.com.ar/tus-notas/como-es-la-argentina-de-la-trata-de-personas-2509 |archivedate=2011-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Recent studies ====

A recent study in 2012 of court cases of the Unidad Fiscal de Asistencia en Secuestros Extorsivos y Trata de Personas  [Fiscal Unit of Assistance in Kidnappings and Trafficking in Persons](UFASE) and the Instituto de Estudios Comparados en Ciencias Penales y Sociales [Institute for Comparative Studies in Criminal and Social Sciences] (INECIP) revealed that trafficking for sexual exploitation is mutating into new forms of subjugation of women, to make it more difficult to prove the existence of slavery in bordellos and thus evading the law. This is a result of the enactment of Law 26.364 in April 2008 that strongly penalizes this offense. The victims have their documents in their possession and in many cases are allowed to leave the sites of exploitation, but the subjugation continues to function in another way. Furthermore, the report shows collusion between state, local, police, and judicial entities that "legitimizes the activity and leads to its habituation." Some 72% of cases are enslaved in nightclubs like ''whiskerías'' (undercover brothels), pubs, or pool halls, all enabled by the municipalities, and the other 22% in private apartments.&lt;ref name=pagina12&gt;{{Cite web|title=Nuevos métodos para eludir la ley|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-191441-2012-04-09.html|accessdate=April 10, 2012|work=[[Página 12]]|date=April 9, 2012|language=Spanish |trans-title=New methods to elude the law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underage victims ===
Worldwide, close to 2.5 million people are victims of some form of trafficking.  Between 22% and 50% are girls and boys. The exact figure is unknown because trafficking in children is usually hidden; for this reason, reliable data cannot be obtained. Many of these situations occur within cities or urban areas. For example, trafficking for the purposes of [[sexual exploitation]] occurs with girls and boys working on city streets. Many rural children from rural areas are moved to the cities by the traffickers.&lt;ref name=Unicef-pdf&gt;{{Cite web|author=Unicef|title=ESTADO MUNDIAL DE LA INFANCIA 2012, Niñas y niños en  un mundo urbano|url=http://www.unicef.org/argentina/spanish/SOWC-2012-Main-Report-LoRes-PDF_SP_01052012.pdf|accessdate=April 30, 2012|work=[[Unicef]]|language=Spanish |trans-title=STATE OF CHILDHOOD 2012, Girls and boys in an urban world}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Department of State of the United States, that which occurs in the world also occurs in Argentina.  Children come from northern provinces, or from bordering countries like Bolivia, Paraguay, and Brazil. Areas with a triple border are a major focus of child trafficking and [[child labor]], especially of children living in border areas and bordering countries. These end up in urban centers of central and south of the country, where [[child sex tourism]] is promoted. Others are victims of forced labor in underground sweatshops and agricultural enterprises.&lt;ref name="clarin informe"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sociedad Trata de personas: Crítico informe de EE.UU. sobre trata de personas en Argentina|url=http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/Critico-informe-EEUU-personas-Argentina_0_423557735.html|work=Periódico El Clarín|date=February 8, 2011|language=Spanish |trans-title=Society/: Trafficking in persons: U.S. report critical on human trafficking in Argentina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the new Argentine law, child trafficking is punishable by the maximum penalty for this offense.  In addition, penalties can be increased if there are aggravating factors.

But when we arrived, it was not a grill: it was a ''whiskería'' (undercover brothel). They locked me up, beat me, raped me and forced me into prostitution. In addition, I was told that if I said anything to anyone, they would do the same thing to my daughters, since they knew where they lived ... I never would have thought that such a thing could happen to me ... "]

Narrative of labor exploitation:&lt;ref name="OIM"/&gt;
{{cita|“Un día por la radio escuché que un fabricante pedía costureros para su taller en Buenos Aires. En Santa Cruz (Bolivia), me entrevisté con una señora que me dijo que  pagaban un peso con cincuenta la prenda, con casa y comida. Ellos pagaban el traslado, y después me lo iban descontando. Mi pasaje salió 120 dólares. Viajamos mi mujer, yo, y unas seis personas más. De la terminal de micros de Retiro nos llevaron directo al taller, y el dueño se quedó con nuestros documentos. El taller tiene dos habitaciones bien grandes, con unas 15 máquinas. Allí trabajamos, comemos y vivimos todos, incluso hay gente con niños pequeños. Trabajamos de lunes a sábado al mediodía, desde las siete de la mañana hasta la una de la madrugada del día siguiente. Al que se cansa o quiere dormir, el dueño lo amenaza con no pagarle nada, con “cagarlo a palos por vago”, o con denunciarlo a la policía para que lo deporten. Las puertas del taller están cerradas con llave, y la puerta de calle también. Ayer cuando le pedí lo que me debía, porque quería mandar plata a mi familia, me dijo que no me  debía nada, me gritó que si lo seguía jodiendo llamaba a los de migraciones y me agarró a las patadas; a mi señora también le pegó.”}}

{{cita|[Translation: "One day I heard on the radio that a manufacturer was asking for sewing workers for their workshop in Buenos Aires. In Santa Cruz (Bolivia), I interviewed with a woman who told me they were paying one peso per fifty garments, with room and board. They would pay for the transportation and later give me a discount. My passage turned out to be $120. We traveled together: my wife, myself, and some six people more. From Retiro, the main terminal for long-distance bus travel in Buenos Aires, they took us straight to the shop and the owner kept our documents. The workshop has two rather large rooms, with about 15 machines. That was where we all worked, ate, and lived, including even people with small children. We worked from Monday to Saturday at noon, from seven o'clock in the morning until one o'clock in the morning of the next day. If anyone gets tired or wants to sleep, the owner threatens to not pay us anything, to "beat the crap out of us for being lazy," or to denounce us to the police so they would deport us. The shop doors are locked and the door to the street as well. Yesterday when I asked what he owed me, because I wanted to send money to my family, he told me he didn't owe me anything, he shouted at me that if I kept screwing around he would call immigration and he grabbed me kicking, he also hit my wife."]|

== Court cases ==

=== Case of Marita Veron ===
{{main|Marita Veron}}
{{See also|Susana Trimarco}}
One of the more well known cases in Argentina is that of Marita Veron, which was brought to court in 2012 after an intensive search and collection of evidence, where part of the network of this country's web of trafficking for sexual exploitation was discovered.

It is known that she left her home on April 3, 2002, and three days later, she was found by police while escaping from a sex party that seems to have been her first destination; she was put on a bus with a group traveling in the direction of Tucuman but never arrived. Later, a witness saw her in one of three Rioja brothels, which the Appeals Chamber of Tucumán described as "places intended for the practice of prostitution where there is a systematic recruitment of women including by means deprivation of liberty." Since then there has been no more information obtained on the whereabouts of Marita.

Marita's mother Susana Trimarco, the principal impulse behind the investigation, has managed to rescue more than 20 women who were victims of trafficking. The Maria de los Angeles Foundation rescues and helps victims of trafficking.

The trial over the disappearance of Marita began on February 8, 2012, and indicted 13 people, 7 men and 6 women, who are linked to the kidnapping and to the promotion of prostitution. It brought together more than 150 witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Comenzó el juicio de Marita Verón, un caso emblemático de trata de personas|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1447059-arranca-el-juicio-de-marita-veron-un-caso-emblematico-de-trata-de-personas|accessdate=March 16, 2012|language=Spanish |trans-title=The opening of the trial of Marita Veron, an emblematic case of human trafficking|date=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial ended on December 11, 2012, and all indicted people were absolved, the mother of Marita Veron will impulse a political trial against the magistrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1536071-conmocion-sin-culpables-en-el-juicio-por-marita-veron|title=Conmoción: sin culpables en el juicio por Marita Verón|author=|date=|website=LaNacion.com.ar|access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UFASE's statistics ===
According to statistics taken from August 22, 2008, to March 7, 2012, by the Fiscal Assistance Unit of Kidnappings and Trafficking (UFASE – Unidad Fiscal de Asistencia en Secuestros Extorsivos y Trata de Personas) responsible for assisting the Argentine fiscal units in the processing of kidnappings and trafficking court cases. Some 64% of court cases were for trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation, while the percentages for trafficking for labor exploitation were 5% rural, 1% textile, and 1% begging. As for sexual exploitation, 77% of the victims were female, 19% male, and 4% transgender. In 70% of cases, the method of recruitment was by "promises of employment", 8% by exploiting the victim's family problems and 8% inducement by romantic relationship, and 3% of cases by the delivery by a family member or acquaintance. Some 52% had no freedom of movement and 45% experienced violence. With regard to the nationality of the victims, 31% were Bolivian, 28% Argentinian, 21% Paraguayan, 10% Dominican, 5% Peruvian, 3% Colombian, and 2% Uruguayan. Source countries for recruitment were 83% in Argentina, 12% in Paraguay, and 1% in Bolivia, while the destination country was 94% for Argentina, 4% Paraguay, and 2% Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Ministerio Público de la Nación, Unidad Fiscal de Asistencia en Secuestros Extorsivos y Trata de Personas |title=INFORME SOBRE PRIMERA ETAPA DEL RELEVAMIENTO DE CASOS  JUDICIALIZADOS DE TRATA DE PERSONAS. |url=http://www.mpf.gov.ar/ics-wpd/DocumentosWeb/LinksNoticias/informe_nea.pdf |language=Spanish |trans-title=REPORT ON FIRST STAGE OF SURVEY OF PROSECUTION OF CASES OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING |access-date=March 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903062612/http://www.mpf.gov.ar/ics-wpd/DocumentosWeb/LinksNoticias/informe_nea.pdf |archivedate=September 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=UFASE |title=Trata de Personas,  Recolección de Datos Estadísticos |url=http://www.mpf.gov.ar/index.asp?page=Accesos/Ufase/ufase3.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805082633/http://www.mpf.gov.ar/index.asp?page=Accesos/Ufase/ufase3.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 5, 2012 |access-date=March 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support programs for victims and others ==

=== Office for Rescue and Caring of Victims of Trafficking ===
According to the new Law 26.364 that was created in August 2008, the "[http://www.jus.gob.ar/areas-tematicas/trata-de-personas.aspx Oficina de Rescate y Acompañamiento a Personas Damnificadas por el Delito de Trata de Personas] &lt;nowiki&gt;[Office of Rescue and Support for People Harmed by the Crime of Trafficking in Persons]&lt;/nowiki&gt;", is under the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Justice Office. The security forces, professionals in psychology, law, and social work have a similar form. They accompany the victim from the time of their rescue or escape from the place of exploitation and during the investigation of the trafficking crime, later providing support and legal assistance until the moment they give testimony. Victims receive psychological, medical, and legal assistance.  Later the victims "testify under conditions of special protection and care"; this can be via a [[Gesell chamber]] or one-way mirror.&lt;ref name=MJD&gt;{{Cite web

The foundation assists victims of sexual exploitation free of charge, and offers legal assistance to victims, counseling for victims and families, and social assistance. It also provides community talks and [[capacity building]] for judges, prosecutors, and police.&lt;ref name="fundacion"&gt;{{Cite web|title=La Fundación Misión |url=http://www.fundacionmariadelosangeles.org/esp/mision.htm |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101234746/http://www.fundacionmariadelosangeles.org/esp/mision.htm |archivedate=2012-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It seeks to prosecute applicable cases under Law 26.364 and to provide psychological support to victims so they can overcome the traumatic situations they have lived through.&lt;ref Name="fundacion"/&gt;

The foundation was founded by [[Susana Trimarco]] in 2007 with the help of the Human Rights Secretariat of Tucuman. Since then this group has achieved the filing of more than 800 court cases, and has found and rescued at least 400 women subjected to sex trafficking without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=La madre que se disfrazó de proxeneta para encontrar a su hija|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2012/04/120402_argentina_caso_marita_veron_una_decada_vh.shtml|work=[[BBC Mundo]]|language=Spanish |trans-title=The mother who dressed as a pimp to find her daughter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susana Trimarco is still searching for her daughter [[Marita Veron|Marita]], who fell victim to sex trafficking on April 3, 2002.  After investigating the crime of trafficking and its networks, and rescuing many victims, including some under 12 years of age, she decided to create the foundation to help victims and to continue searching for her daughter. The vision of the foundation is to eradicate the trafficking of persons in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=La Fundación      Visión |url=http://www.fundacionmariadelosangeles.org/esp/vision.htm |language=Spanish |trans-title=The foundation's vision |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917114331/http://www.fundacionmariadelosangeles.org/esp/vision.htm |archivedate=2008-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faraday Medal''' is the top medal awarded by the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET) (previously called the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/institution-history/faraday-winners.cfm IET Archives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201132517/http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/institution-history/faraday-winners.cfm |date=December 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/theme-print.jsp?articleid=93187 Oxford DNB thematic list]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015111/http://conferences.theiet.org/achievement/awards/medals/faraday.cfm|archivedate=2015-11-17|url=http://conferences.theiet.org/achievement/awards/medals/faraday.cfm|publisher=theiet.org|location=London|title=IET Awards - Faraday Medal: Awards, prizes and scholarships within engineering and technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the [[IET Achievement Medals]] collection of awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conferences.theiet.org/achievement/awards/medals/achieve-medals.cfm|title=IET Achievement Medals.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medal is named after the famous [[Michael Faraday]] FRS, the father of electromagnetism. Faraday is widely recognized as a top scientist, engineer, chemist, and inventor. His electromagnetic induction principles have been widely used in electric motors and generators today.

==Background==
The medal is awarded annually to distinguished individuals who either for notable scientific or industrial achievement in engineering or for conspicuous service rendered to the advancement of science, engineering and technology, without restriction as regards to nationality, country of residence or membership of the Institution. The award was first established in 1922 to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the first Ordinary Meeting of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and is named after [[Michael Faraday]]. Each year, the recipient received his/her award at a ceremony held in London that is hosted by the IET.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://conferences.theiet.org/achievement/ceremony/index.cfm|title=IET Awards ceremony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winners==
Medal recipients include Nobel Prize winners and scientists, from the discoverer of electrons to the father of optics.

'''[[Incitement]] to racial or [[ethnic hatred]]''' is a crime under the laws of several countries.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], the Racial Hatred Act 1995 amends the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]], inserting Part IIA - Offensive Behaviour Because of Race, Colour, National or Ethnic Origin.  It does not, however, address the issue of incitement to [[racial hatred]]. The Australian state of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] has addressed the question, however, with its enactment of the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001.

==Finland==
In [[Finland]], agitation against an ethnic group ({{lang-fi|kiihottaminen kansanryhmää vastaan}}) is a crime according to the [[Criminal Code of Finland]]'s (1889/39 and 2011/511) chapter 11, section 10:

'''''Section 10 - Ethnic agitation''' (511/2011)''

''A person who makes available to the public or otherwise spreads among the public or keeps available for the public information, an expression of opinion or another message where a certain group is threatened, defamed or insulted on the  basis of its race, skin colour, birth status, national or ethnic origin, religion or  belief, sexual orientation or disability or a comparable basis, shall be sentenced  for ethnic agitation to a fine or to imprisonment for at most two years.''

'''''Section 10(a) – Aggravated ethnic agitation''' (511/2011)''

''If the ethnic agitation involves incitement or enticement (1) to genocide or the preparation of genocide, a crime against humanity, an  aggravated crime against humanity, a war crime, an aggravated war  crime, murder, or manslaughter committed for terrorist intent, or  (2) to serious violence other than what is referred to in paragraph 1 so that  the act clearly endangers public order and safety, and the ethnic agitation also when assessed as a whole is aggravated, the offender shall be sentenced for aggravated ethnic agitation to imprisonment for at least  four months and at most four years.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001#L11P10|title=FINLEX ® - Ajantasainen lainsäädäntö: Rikoslaki 39/1889|first=Edita Publishing|last=Oy|website=www.finlex.fi|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== France ==
Section 24 of the Press Law of 1881 criminalizes incitement to racial discrimination, hatred, or violence on the basis of one's origin or membership in an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group.&lt;ref&gt;Loi du 29 juillet 1881 sur la liberté de la presse&lt;/ref&gt; A criminal code provision deems it an offense to engage in similar conduct via private communication.&lt;ref&gt;Loi n° 90-615 du 13 juillet 1990 tendant à réprimer tout acte raciste, antisémite ou xénophobe&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, four Muslim organizations filed a complaint against [[Michel Houellebecq]] for stating that Islam was "stupid" and "dangerous" in an interview. The court found that Houellebecq was not immune from the charge on the grounds of literary immunity or freedom of speech, but acquitted him on the grounds that he criticized Islam rather than individual Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Curtis, ''Jews, Antisemitism, and the Middle East''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/french-writer-who-called-islam-stupid-cleared-by-judges-140850.html|title=French writer who called Islam 'stupid' cleared by judges|date=23 October 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/sep/18/booksnews.islam|title=Calling Islam stupid lands author in court|first=Paul|last=Webster|date=17 September 2002|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, politician [[Jean Marie Le Pen]] was convicted of inciting [[racial hatred]], for comments made to Le Monde in 2003 about the consequences of Muslim immigration in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2005/02/24/jean-marie-le-pen-condamne-pour-incitation-a-la-haine-raciale_399429_3224.html|title=Jean-Marie Le Pen condamné pour incitation à la haine raciale|date=24 February 2005|publisher=|via=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/archive-news-detail.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=frances-far-right-leader-le-pen-convicted-of-inciting-racial-hatred-2006-05-12|title=WORLD - France|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/world/le-pen-convicted-of-inciting-racial-hatred-258282.html|title=Le Pen convicted of inciting racial hatred|date=11 May 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar complaints were brought in 2015 after he compared Muslim street prayers to the [[Nazi occupation of France]] in 2010, but he was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/marine-le-pen-cleared-of-inciting-hatred-after-comparing-muslim-prayers-in-the-street-to-nazi-a6774126.html|title=Marine Le Pen cleared of inciting hatred|date=15 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, actress and animal-rights campaigner [[Brigitte Bardot]] was convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred for her criticism concerning the ritual slaughter of sheep during the feast of [[Eid al-Adha]] in a letter to then-Interior Minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].

{{Main|Volksverhetzung}}

==United Kingdom==
Under the [[law of the United Kingdom]], "incitement to racial hatred" was established as an offence by the provisions of §§ 17-29 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]]. It was first established as a criminal offence in the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]. The [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] made publication of material that incited racial hatred an [[arrestable offence]].

This offence refers to:
* deliberately provoking hatred of a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial group]]
* distributing racist material to the public
* making inflammatory public speeches
* creating racist websites on the Internet
* inciting inflammatory rumours about an individual or an ethnic group, for the purpose of spreading racial discontent.

Laws against incitement to hatred against religions were later established under the [[Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006]]. However this legislation is not present in Scotland.

In the context of [[computer programming]], '''instrumentation''' refers to an ability to monitor or measure the level of a product's performance, to diagnose errors, and to write [[Tracing (software)|trace]] information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/rtrthelp/v8r0m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.rational.testrt.doc%2Ftopics%2Fcinstruovw.html Source Code Instrumentation Overview at IBM website]&lt;/ref&gt; Programmers implement instrumentation in the form of code [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] that monitor specific components in a system (for example, instructions may output logging information to appear on the screen). When an application contains instrumentation code, it can be managed by using a management tool. Instrumentation is necessary to review the performance of the application. Instrumentation approaches can be of two types: source instrumentation and binary instrumentation.

== Output ==
In programming, instrumentation means the ability of an application to incorporate:

* Code [[Tracing (software)|tracing]] - receiving informative messages about the execution of an application at run time.
* [[Debugging]] and (structured) [[exception handling]] - tracking down and fixing programming errors in an application under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/commenting-testing-and-instrumenting-cod/229300224|title=Commenting, Testing, and Instrumenting Code|date=January 3, 2011|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Profiling (computer programming)|Profiling]] - a means by which dynamic program behaviors can be measured during a training run with a representative input.  This is useful for properties of a program that  cannot be [[static program analysis|analyzed statically]] with sufficient precision, such as [[alias analysis]].
* Performance counters - components that allow the tracking of the performance of the application.
* [[Computer data logging]] - components that allow the logging and tracking of major events in the execution of the application.

== Limitations ==

Instrumentation is limited by execution coverage.  If the program never reaches a particular point of execution, then instrumentation at that point collects no data.  For instance, if a word processor application is instrumented, but the user never activates the print feature, then the instrumentation can say nothing about the routines which are used exclusively by the printing feature.

Some types of instrumentation may cause a dramatic increase in execution time.  This may limit the application of instrumentation to debugging contexts.

==See also==
* [[Hooking]] - range of techniques used to alter or augment the behavior of an operating system, of applications, or of other software components either by intercepting function calls or messages or events passed between software components
* [[Instruction set simulator]] - simulation of all instructions at machine code level to provide instrumentation
* [[Runtime intelligence]] - technologies, managed services and practices for the collection, integration, analysis, and presentation of application usage levels, patterns, and practices
* [[Software performance analysis]] - techniques to monitor code performance, including instrumentation
* [[Hardware performance counter]]
* [[DTrace]] — A comprehensive dynamic tracing framework for troubleshooting kernel and application problems on production systems in real time, implemented in [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[macOS]], [[FreeBSD]], and many other platforms and products.
* [[Java Management Extensions|''Java Management Extensions'' (JMX)]] –  Java technology for managing and monitoring applications, system objects, devices (such as printers), and service-oriented networks
* [[Application Response Measurement]] - standardized instrumentation [[Application programming interface|API]] for [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]
* [[Dynamic recompilation]] - a feature of some emulators and virtual machines where the system may recompile some part of a program during execution

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5774">'''Jody Gibson''' (self-nicknamed "Babydol") is an American former [[procuring (prostitution)|madam]] who was active in Hollywood in the late 1980s through 1990s.

Going by the pseudonym "Sasha of the Valley", Gibson operated an "[[escort agency]]" in [[Hollywood]],&lt;ref name="eonline" /&gt; during which time she employed several hundred women across 16 States of the [[United States of America]], and also in Europe. In June 1999 she was arrested on charges of [[pimping]] and conspiracy; subsequently being convicted, she served 22 months imprisonment in the [[Central California Women's Facility]].&lt;ref name="Monsters and Critics"/&gt;

== Biography ==
Gibson was raised in [[Westchester County, New York]] in a show business family.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Magazine" /&gt; Her father was a 1940s [[CBS radio]] announcer who later owned a chain of clothing boutiques. Her mother, Tobe Gibson, was a personal talent manager who discovered [[Tom Cruise]] as an unknown actor; her sister Amy Gibson was an [[Emmy]]-nominated actress, and aunt was the singer [[Georgia Gibbs]].&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Magazine" /&gt; It was her aunt's career that gave Gibson the ambition to be a pop music singer. Upon high school graduation she left Westchester and relocated to [[Manhattan]], where she lived on the [[Upper East Side]] for several years. She relocated to [[Los Angeles]], California in 1984 seeking a music and modeling career. For two years she was an occasional actress on the [[USA Network]]'s [[USA Up All Night|''Up All Night with Rhonda Shear'']].&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Magazine"/&gt; Whilst trying to get her recording career off the ground, to make a living she began a small modelling agency in 1988, which quickly evolved into an illicit [[escort service|escort business]] servicing a financially exclusive clientele.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Gibson, 'Crime Watch Daily', 5 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prostitution Procurement ==
On June 8, 1999, Gibson was arrested in a [[sting operation]] in West Los Angeles and charged with [[pimp]]ing and [[procuring (prostitution)|pandering]]. At the time of her arrest the prosecuting authorities stated that Gibson ran one of the largest prostitution procurement operations since [[Heidi Fleiss]], employing around 300 women.&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt; Her subsequent trial led to a conviction and imprisonment. Gibson's customer database, or ''Black Book'', was entered as evidence at her 2000 trial, listing [[Bruce Willis]], [[Tommy Lasorda]], pop musician [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]], film producer [[Don Simpson]], and former Texas lieutenant governor [[Ben Barnes (politician)|Ben Barnes]] among her clients. Willis, Barnes, Lasorda were among those who subsequently denied any association with Gibson's business.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Big Story" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT The Lede"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Evening Standard', 'Bruce Willis Named in Madam's trick book', 27 February 2007. https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/bruce-willis-named-in-madams-trick-book-7172629.html&lt;/ref&gt; On release from prison in 2002 Gibson published an autobiographical account of her life in Hollywood entitled ''[[Secrets of a Hollywood Super Madam]]''.

==Career==
Kireeti Damaraju started his acting career with shortfilms "Ontiganta" and "Anukokunda". Anukokunda which was selected for cannes gave him the jump start to land in a feature film role of "subbarao" in the Second Hand Movie.&lt;ref&gt;Interview http://www.123telugu.com/interviews/exclusive-interview-kireeti-trivikram-is-a-blessing-for-tfi.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bham Bolenath]] Kireeti plays the role of a drug addict with [[Naveen Chandra]] and [[Idlebrain.com]] Jeevi remarks that " Pradeep and Kireeti characters remind us of Ramesh-Suresh duo from Cadbury ads."&lt;ref&gt;Bham Bolenath review http://www.idlebrain.com/movie/archive/bhambolenath.html&lt;/ref&gt; He also acted in "Many Happy Returns" a sitcom directed by [[Gangaraju Gunnam|Gunnam Gangaraju]].&lt;ref&gt;Sitcom by Gunnam Gangaraju http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/A-new-sitcom-by-Gunnam-Gangaraju/article14384545.ece&lt;/ref&gt; Srividya Palaparthi of [[Times of India]] praises Kireeti saying "While Tarun and Avanthika's acting skills were evidently amateur, Kireeti Damaraju stood out in terms of acting, and comic timing." &lt;ref&gt;Kireeti in Meeku Meere Maaku Meme http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movie-reviews/Meeku-Meere-Maaku-Meme/movie-review/52798304.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

Before venturing into the Telugu Film Industry, Kireeti worked for [[Electronic Arts]], [[Hyderabad]]. He is also an avid gamer and a usability engineering expert. A lot of his thought process and philosophy to life have been inspired from his deep interests in Japanese anime and manga.

[[File:Lahu flag.svg|thumb|Flag of the Lahu people{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}]]
The '''Lahu people''' ({{zh|拉祜族}}; [[Lahu language|Lahu]]: ''Ladhulsi'' / ''Kawzhawd''; {{lang-vi|La Hủ}}) are an [[ethnic group]] of [[China]] and [[Southeast Asia|Mainland Southeast Asia]].

== Distribution ==
The Lahu are one of the [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognized by the People's Republic of China, where about 720,000 live in [[Yunnan]] province, mostly in [[Lancang Lahu Autonomous County]].  In [[Thailand]], the Lahu are one of the six main groups categorized as [[Hill tribe (Thailand)|hill tribe]]s.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The [[Tai languages|Tai]] often refer to them by the [[exonym]] '''''Muso''''' ({{lang-th|มูเซอ}}), meaning 'hunter'.  They are one of [[list of ethnic groups in Vietnam|54 ethnic groups]] in [[Vietnam]], and mostly live in [[Lai Châu Province]].&lt;ref | name = Lexicon /&gt;

A few Lahu, along with the [[Hmong people|Hmong]], [[Lao people|Lao]], and [[Mien people|Mien]] were recruited by the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] to help fight against the communist [[Pathet Lao]], known as the secret war, during the [[Laotian Civil War]].  In fear of retribution when the Pathet Lao took over the Laotian government in 1975, those who had helped the United States fled to neighboring Thailand seeking political asylum.

A couple thousand Lahu have resettled in the United States as refugees, in the states of [[California]], [[Minnesota]], [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], and [[Utah]].  Most Lahu Americans live in [[Visalia, California]], thus making [[Visalia, CA|Visalia]] home to the largest concentration of Lahu people outside of [[Asia]].

==Subgroups==
[[File:Lahu tribe depiction, 1900s.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Burmese depiction of the Lahu Na (Black Lahu)]]
The Lahu divide themselves into a number of subgroups, such as the Lahu Na (Black Lahu), Lahu Nyi (Red Lahu), Lahu Hpu (White Lahu), Lahu Shi (Yellow Lahu) and the Lahu Shehleh. Where a subgroup name refers to a color, it refers to the traditional color of their dress. These groups do not function as [[tribe]]s or [[clan]]s - there are no kin groups above that of the family. Lahu trace [[Kinship and descent|descent]] [[bilineal descent|bilaterally]], and typically practice [[Kinship terminology|matrilocal residence]].

Bradley (1979) lists the following Lahu ethnic subgroups.

;Black Lahu

;Non-Lahu (some have "become" Lahu)
*Micha (Lisoid group)
*Bana (Akoid group)

==Language==
{{main article|Lahu language}}
The Lahu language is part of the [[Loloish languages|Loloish]] branch of the [[Lolo–Burmese]] subgroup of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] family (itself a member of the [[Sino-Tibetan language family]]). Like most of its relatives, it is a strongly [[isolating language]] with [[subject–object–verb]] word order, and a set of [[measure word|numeral classifiers]]. There are seven [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]], and consonants cannot close syllables. The language spoken by the Lahu Shi is notably divergent from that spoken by the other groups. In Thailand, Lahu Na often serves as a [[lingua franca]] among the various hill tribes.  Written Lahu uses the [[Latin alphabet]].  Among Christian villages, the language has been enriched by loanwords from English, Latin and Greek via Bible translation, plus [[neologism]]s in the areas of hygiene, music and education.&lt;ref | name = Lexicon /&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Elderly Lahu woman.jpg|thumb|An elderly Lahu woman at a refugee camp in Thailand.]]
The traditional Lahu religion is [[polytheistic]]. Buddhism was introduced in the late 17th century and became widespread. Many Lahu people in China are Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/EthnicGroups/136927.htm|title=The Lahu Ethnic Group|website=China.org.cn|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity became established in Burma in the 19th century and has been spreading since.

The Lahu of Northeastern Thailand had encounters with Theravada Buddhist [[Thai Forest Tradition|forest monks (tudong monks)]] around the years 1930–1940. The leader of such a group of monks, [[Mun Bhuridatta]], spent some time in Lahu territory. These Lahu asked him for a "[[gatha]] that would protect them from ghosts and demons."&lt;ref&gt;Forest Recollections, K. Tyavanich, Honolulu 1997, p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
Lahu people used to have just a given name, until the [[Government of China|Chinese Government]] gave them surnames. About 90% of the Lahu people are either named Lee or Zhang, two of the most common Chinese surnames. Lahu given names are made of two syllables: one that shows the gender and one that gives information on the day of birth, based on the zodiac. For example, a person born on the [[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]] day will be named “Zanu” if he is a boy and “Nanu” if she is a girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog-en.namepedia.org/2015/03/lahu-names-china/|title=namepedia blog - All about names, without the gloves|website=Blog-en.namepedia.org|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lead(II) chromate''' ([[Lead|Pb]][[Chromium|Cr]][[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is a [[chemical compound]], a [[chromate]] of [[lead]]. It has a vivid yellow color and is insoluble in water, and as a result, is used in paints under the name '''[[chrome yellow]]'''.

Lead(II) chromate may also be known as chrome yellow, chromic acid lead(II) salt, canary chrome yellow 40-2250, Holtint Middle Chrome, chrome green, chrome green UC61, chrome green UC74, chrome green UC76, chrome lemon, crocoite, dianichi chrome yellow G, lemon yellow, king's yellow, Leipzig yellow, lemon yellow, Paris yellow, pigment green 15, plumbous chromate, pure lemon chrome L3GS, and various other names. The mineral [[crocoite]], occurring as orange-yellow prismatic crystals, is a moderately rare mineral known from the oxidation zones of such Pb ore beds, that were affected by chromate-bearing solutions, coming from the oxidation of primary Cr minerals ([[chromite]]) of the nearby (ultra)[[mafic rock]]s.

==Structure==
Lead chromate adopts the [[monazite]] structure, meaning that the connectivity of the atoms is very similar to other compounds of the type MM'O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  Pb(II) has a distorted coordination sphere being surrounded by eight oxides with Pb-O distances ranging from 2.53 to 2.80 Å.  The chromate anion is tetrahedral, as usual.&lt;ref&gt;Quareni, S.; de Pieri, R. "A three-dimensional refinement of the structure of crocoite, PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;" Acta Crystallographica 1965, volume 19, p287-p289. {{doi|10.1107/S0365110X65003304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Approximately 37,000 tons were produced in 1996.  The main applications are as a pigment in paints.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;   It has also been used in the paint to color school buses.

Lead chromate is used in some [[pyrotechnic composition]]s, especially [[delay composition]]s, as an [[oxidizer]].{{fact|date=September 2016}}
==Preparation==
Lead(II) chromate can be produced by treating [[sodium chromate]] with lead salts such as [[lead(II) nitrate]] or by combining [[lead(II) oxide]] with [[chromic acid]].  Related pigments are produced by the addition of sulfate, resulting in a mixed lead-chromate-sulfate compositions.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;
[[File:C.I.77600.jpg|thumb|left|164 px|| Lead(II) chromate, historical dye collection of the Technical University of Dresden, Germany]]

== Reactions ==
Heating in [[hydroxide]] solution produces [[chrome red]], a red or orange powder made by [[Lead(II) oxide|PbO]] and [[Chromium trioxide|CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Also, in [[hydroxide]] solution lead chromate slowly dissolves forming [[plumbite]] complex.

::PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp; → &amp;nbsp; [Pb(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

== Safety hazards ==
Containing both [[lead]] and [[hexavalent chromium]], lead chromate is treated with great care in its manufacture, the main concerns being dust. "extensive epidemiological investigations have given no indication that the practically insoluble lead chromate pigments
have any carcinogenic properties".&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Völz, Hans G. ''et al.'' "Pigments, Inorganic" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2006 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a20_243.pub2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s, the product was used to impart a bright yellow color to some types of [[candy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Progress Report of Public Health in Wisconsin, Volume 10|year=1887|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aC9NAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=%22chromate+of+lead%22+candy|author=Wisconsin. State Board of Health|accessdate=17 July 2013}} (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes used (illegally) to enhance the color of certain spices, particularly turmeric.&lt;ref name="spice_trade"&gt;{{cite web |title=The American Spice Trade Association’s Statement on Lead in Turmeric - ASTA: The Voice of the U.S. Spice Industry in the Global Market |url=https://www.astaspice.org/the-american-spice-trade-associations-statement-on-lead-in-turmeric/ |website=ASTA: The Voice of the U.S. Spice Industry in the Global Market |accessdate=21 November 2018 |date=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC_spices"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Angelon-Gaetz |first1=Kim A. |last2=Klaus |first2=Christen |last3=Chaudhry |first3=Ezan A. |last4=Bean |first4=Deidre K. |title=Lead in Spices, Herbal Remedies, and Ceremonial Powders Sampled from Home Investigations for Children with Elevated Blood Lead Levels — North Carolina, 2011–2018 |journal=MMWR.

Previously, its use was more widespread. Lead(II) chromate and "[[white lead]]", or [[lead(II) carbonate]], were the most common [[Lead paint|lead-based paint]] pigments.

The '''Malaysian Indians''' or '''Indian Malaysians''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: ''மலேசிய இந்தியர்கள்'') consist of people of full or partial Indian through paternal descent —particularly [[Tamil people|Tamil Indians]] who were born in or immigrated to Malaysia from Tamil Nadu. 
Most are descendants from those who migrated from India during the [[British Malaya|British colonisation of Malaya]]. There is a possibility that the first wave of  migration from South Asian subcontinent towards Southeast Asia happened when the Asoka's invasion towards Kalinga and [[Samudragupta]]'s expedition towards the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Balaji|last=Sadasivan|title=The Dancing Girl: A History of Early India|pages=135–136|isbn=978-9814311670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, they form the third largest  group in Malaysia after the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] and the 
[[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]].

Malaysian Indian form the 5th largest community of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Overseas Indians]] in the world. Within Malaysia, they represent the third largest group (constituting 7% of the Malaysian population), after the ethnic [[Malaysian Malay|Malay]] and [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]].&lt;ref name="themalaymailonline.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/population-to-hit-30-million-today-statistics-department-says | title=Population to hit 30 million this week, Statistics Department says | newspaper=Malay Mail | date=26 February 2014 | accessdate=4 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually simply referred to as "Indian" in Malaysia, ''Orang India'' or ''Hindu'' in Malay, ''"Yin du ren"'' in Chinese.

Malaysia's Indian population is notable for its class stratification, with large elite and lower income groups and diverse racial differences even within its fold. Malaysian Indians make up a disproportionately large percentage of professionals per capita - constituting 15.5% of Malaysia's professionals in 1999.&lt;ref name="Haque"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Role of the State in Managing Ethnic Tensions in Malaysia |journal= American Behavorial Scientist|volume= 47|number= 3|date=November 2003 |pages=240–266 |url=http://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/polhaque/abs.pdf |author=M.

==History==

===First Wave:Pre-colonial period===
{{main article|Greater India}}
[[File:Candi Batu Pahat of Bujang Valley.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Candi Bukit Batu Pahat of [[Bujang Valley]]. A Hindu-Buddhist kingdom ruled ancient [[Kedah]] possibly as early as 110 A.D, the earliest evidence of strong Indian influence which was once prevalent among the pre-Islamic [[Kedahan Malay]]s.]]
[[Indian History|Ancient India]] exerted a profound influence over Southeast Asia through trade, religious missions, wars and other forms of contact. Pre-colonial Malaysia was part of 'Indianised Kingdoms' such as  [[Srivijaya]], Kadaram and the [[Majapahit]], which formed part of a cultural region known as [[Greater India]].
[[File:Battle of kedah.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A Siamese painting depicting the [[Chola invasion of Kadaram|Chola raid on Kadaram]] (modern day [[Kedah]]) in year 1025.]]

The Arab and Indian traders had travelled this region including the southern tip of South East Asia the peninsula with maritime trade,&lt;ref name=Sneddon2003&gt;{{cite book | last = Sneddon| first = James|title = The Indonesian Language: Its history and role in modern society| year = 2003| publisher = University of South Wales Press Ltd| location = Sydney| page = 73}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sailendra]] kings of [[Java]] originating from [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] were able to take control of the [[Peninsular Malaysia|Peninsular]] and part of southern [[Siam]]. The kings welcomed Buddhist missionaries from India, accepting their teaching of the [[Mahayana]] sect, which spread through their territories. However, central and northeastern Thailand continued to adhere to the Hinayana teachings of the Theravada sect, which had been introduced by missionaries sent by the emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC.
Another theory of the introduction of Buddhism after Indian arrived in the peninsula is that after Kalinga conquered lower [[Burma]] in the 8th century their influence gradually spread down the peninsula. The ancient Indian Kalinga was located in southeastern India occupying modern day Orissa and northern Andhra Pradesh. In the 7th century an Indonesian kingdom was named Kalingga&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hgtVFGCJkj0C&amp;pg=PT20 Sejarah SMA/MA Kls XI-Bahasa By H Purwanta, dkk]&lt;/ref&gt; after the aforementioned Kalinga in India. Chinese sources mention this kingdom (''Holing'') as a center for Buddhist scholars around 604 before it was overshadowed by the Sanjaya or [[Mataram Kingdom]]. The most famous Kalingga ruler is Ratu Sima.

There is evidence of the existence of [[Indianised kingdom]]s such as [[Gangga Negara]], Old [[Kedah]], [[Srivijaya]] since approximately 1700 years ago.&lt;ref name="Volume 7 2009"&gt;European Journal of Social Sciences – Volume 7, Number 3 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Early contact between the kingdoms of [[Ancient Tamil country|Tamilakkam]] and the Malay peninsula had been very close during the reigns of the [[Pallava dynasty]] (from the 4th to the 9th century CE) and [[Chola dynasty]] (from the 9th to the 13th century CE). The trade relations the Tamil merchants had with the ports of [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] led to the emergence of Indianised kingdoms like Kadaram ([[Bujang Valley|Old Kedah]]) and [[Langkasuka|Langkasugam]].&lt;ref name=International2000&gt;{{cite book|last = International Tamil Language Foundation| first = |title = The Handbook of Tamil Culture and Heritage| year = 2000| publisher = International Tamil Language Foundation| location = Chicago| page = 877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Chola king [[Rajendra Chola I]] sent an expedition to Kadaram ([[Srivijaya]]) during the 11th century conquering that country on behalf of one of its rulers who sought his protection and to have established him on the throne. The Cholas had a powerful [[Merchant Navy|merchant]] and [[naval fleet]] in the Indian Ocean and the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Three kinds of craft are distinguished by the author of the ''Periplus'' – light coasting boats for local traffic, larger vessels of a more complicated structure and greater carrying capacity, and lastly the big ocean-going vessels that made the voyages to Malaya, [[Sumatra]], and the [[Ganges]].&lt;ref name=Sastri2000&gt;{{cite book | last = Sastri| first = K.A. Nilakanta|title = Cholas| origyear = 1935 | edition = fifth printing | year = 2000| publisher = University of Madras| location = Chennai| pages = 86 &amp; 318}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Malacca Sultanate]], the [[Chitty]] people, played a huge role in Malacca's administration of the local ports such as [[Raja Mudaliar]], Syahbandar (Chief of Port) of Malacca and [[Bendahara]] [[Tun Mutahir of Malacca|Tun Mutahir]], a famous [[Bendahara]] of the [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malaccan Sultanate]].

===Second Wave: Colonial period===
[[File:SS Rajula.jpg|thumb|''SS Rajula'', operating her fortnightly "Straits Service" between [[Madras]] to Penang, [[Port Klang]] and Singapore from 1926 to 1972. The vessel transported many Indian migrants between South India to then-[[British Malaya]] as well as independent Malaysia.]]
Following the Portuguese colonisation of [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca]] ([[Malaysia]]) in 1511, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to bring their married Indian women who were converted already to Roman Catholic Christianity, under a policy set by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], then [[Viceroy]] of [[Portuguese India|India]]. These people were [[Goan Catholics]] ([[Konkani people|Konkani]] Catholics) and [[East Indians]] (Catholics of [[Marathi people|Marathi descent]]). [[Kupari]]s who were of mixed Samvedic Brahmin, Goan and Portuguese descent also arrived. Their children already intermarried with Malay population, losing their ethnic identities. British acquisition of [[Penang]], [[Melaka]], and [[Singapore]] - the Straits Settlements from 1786 to 1824 started a steady inflow of Indian labour. This consisted of traders, policemen, plantation labourers and colonial soldiers (see [[sepoy]]s). Apart from this there was also substantial migration of Indians to work in the British colonial government, due to their general good command of the English language.&lt;ref name="Volume 7 2009"/&gt;

[[File:The Indian Stick Display at Balik Pulau, Penang in 1937.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thaipusam]] Celebration in [[Balik Pulau]], [[Penang]]. 1937]]
The establishment of the plantations and the need for cheap labour led to an influx of Indian migrants working under the indenture [[Kangani system]] in the 19th and early 20th century. Some, after the Kangani system ended in the early 20th century, also paid for their own passage to Malaya.  These migrant workers were primarily Tamils (around 80%), with some [[Telugus]], [[Malayalis]] as well as other groups from northern India. The Tamils were non-Brahmin middle-ranking or low caste Hindus, including [[Gounder]],  [[Kallar (caste)|Kallar]], [[Muthuraja]], [[Vanniyar]], [[Pallar]] and [[Paraiyar]], the Telugus include [[Kamma (caste)|Kamma]] and [[Reddy]], while the Malayali were mostly from the [[Velakkathala Nair|Nayar]] caste.&lt;ref name="rajoo"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-AR-V3ymAzoC&amp;pg=PA150|title= Malaysian World-view|editor= Mohd. Taib Osman |author=R. Rajoo |pages= 149&amp;ndash;150 |publisher=Inst of Southeast Asian Studies |date=1985|isbn= 978-9971988128}}&lt;/ref&gt; These workers were distinct from the commercial and educated group of urban Indians, who were often high caste or high and middle class Tamils, Malayali, [[Punjabis]], [[Sindhis]], [[Gujaratis]], [[Marwaris]] and others. These urban Indians may be Hindus, Christians, Sikhs or Muslims.  The [[Sikhs]] mainly worked in the police force, while other northern Indians were involved in business. The Malayali, Ceylonese and Christian Tamils may be involved in government and private work-collar work, the [[Chettiar]] in money-lending or finance, while the [[Vellalar]] and Muslim Tamils may be in various kind of businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-AR-V3ymAzoC&amp;pg=PA151|title= Malaysian World-view|editor= Mohd. Taib Osman |author=R. Rajoo |pages= 150&amp;ndash;151 |publisher=Inst of Southeast Asian Studies |date=1985|isbn= 978-9971988128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian population in [[British Malaya|pre-independence Malaya]] and Singapore was predominantly adult males who were single with family back in [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. Hence the population fluctuated frequently with the immigration and exodus of people. As early as 1901 the Indian population in the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay States was approximately 120,000. By 1931 there were 640,000 Indians in Malaya and Singapore and they even outnumbered the native [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] in the state of [[Selangor]] that year.

However, during [[World War II]] many Indian men and women left for [[Burma]] as part of the [[Indian National Army]] with thousands thought to have perished. As a result, the population of Indians in 1957 had only increased to 820,000. While immigration was a major factor for the increase in population until Independence, the population growth began falling after that as the white collar classes in the civil service and plantations left when British institutions and companies left the country. Since then, lower birth rates and emigration to countries like [[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[UK]], etc. in search of better educational and economic opportunities meant that Indians continue to see their share of Malaysia's population decline just as is the case with the [[Chinese people|Chinese]]. Today, Malaysian Indians account for approximately 7 per cent of the total population of Malaysia (approx. 2 million) and 9 per cent in Singapore (450,000).

===Third Wave : Contemporary period===
From the 1990s to the present period, there has also been a  much smaller wave of Indian nationals into Singapore and Malaysia to work in the construction and engineering industry, restaurants, the IT sector, teaching and finance with many taking up permanent residence in Singapore where they account for nearly a quarter of the Singapore population. The unskilled labour mainly work in Indian restaurants. There are also foreign spouses from the Indian Subcontinent who are married to local Indians.

[[File:Little India (Johor Bahru).jpg|thumb|Little India in [[Johor Bahru]], [[Johor]].]]
[[File:Little India (Melaka).jpg|thumb|Little India in [[Melaka City]], [[Melaka]].]]

7.0% of the Malaysian population are Indians as of 2016.&lt;ref name="population"/&gt;

There is a close correspondence between the ethnic and occupational divisions of the South Asian community, and this is inevitably reflected in the community's geographical distribution in Malaya. The South Indian Tamils were the majority throughout the country, on the rubber estates and railways, though a significant proportion found employment on the docks in [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]].  
Selangor is the state with the most number of Indians in terms of absolute number whereas Negeri Sembilan is the state with the highest proportion of Malaysian Indians making up the population.&lt;ref name="2015 population"/&gt;

== Education ==
[[File:Malaysia indian boys.jpg|thumb|right|Malaysian Indian boys in school.]]
The economic state of Malaysian Indians is stratified and the distribution of wealth is uneven. However, while many Indians are part of the Malaysian [[working class]], there also exists a large group of educated [[upper middle class]] professionals.

Indians are well represented in Malaysian medical and legal fraternities. Indians also form a large portion of English language teachers in Malaysia. Law and medicine have traditionally been the preferred career choices in Indian families although more young Indian Malaysians are now venturing into other fields such as engineering, finance and entrepreneurship. [[Ananda Krishnan]] and [[Tony Fernandes]] are examples of notable Malaysian [[tycoon]]s of Indian heritage. There are major Indian business districts in [[Kuala Lumpur]] ([[Brickfields]], Jalan Ampang and [[Jalan Masjid India]]); (Lebuh Pasar) in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], Penang; Jalan Tengku Kelana&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitselangor.com/little-india-klang/|title=Little India, Klang|work=VisitSelangor.com|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Klang, Malaysia|Klang]], Selangor; and [[Ipoh]], Perak. [[Education in Malaysia|Tamil primary schools]] are funded by the [[Government of Malaysia|Federal Government]] and use Tamil as the medium of instruction while Malay and English are taught as compulsory subjects.

==Economy and employment==
There are considerable differences socially and economically between different groups of Indians in Malaysia. They form a significant part of the professional classes in Malaysia; in a census taken in 1999, Malaysian Indians were 15.5% of Malaysia's professional workforce.&lt;ref name="Haque" /&gt; These include doctors (28.4%), lawyers (26.8%), dentists (21%), veterinary surgeons (28.5%), engineers (6.4%), accountants (5.8%), surveyors (3.0%) and architects (1.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/community/2013/11/23/unite-as-a-community/|title=Unite as a community|last=Rajah|first=M|date=23 Nov 2013|website=The Star|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many Indians are also ranked amongst the most disadvantaged. In 1970, around 39% of Indians in Malaysia were ranked among the poorest of the country.&lt;ref name="Haque"/&gt; While there had been significant progress economically among the Malays, many Indians are still poor, with around 40% claimed to be at the bottom rung of the income ladder in 2015.&lt;ref name="malaymail2015"/&gt; 
[[File:KITLV - 79935 - Kleingrothe, C.J. - Medan - Sowing on a rubber plantation in Malaysia - circa 1910.tif|thumb|Workers in a plantation {{circa}} 1910]]
Many of the early South Indian immigrants such as the Tamils and Telugus worked in the agriculture sector, in particular as workers in plantations. In 1930, 60% of all Indians were in this sector, and by 1970, 45% of Indians were still involved in agriculture in Malaysia.{{sfn|Sandhu|2006|page=162}} Sri Lanka Tamils mainly occupied the subordinate administrative and technical positions in estates, positions they still dominate to this day.{{sfn|Sandhu|2006|page=166}} Also in the estates are the Malayalis who hold assistant and managerial positions. Few of these estates however are Indian-owned.{{sfn|Sandhu|2006|page=167}} Indians are also prominent in the transport and communication sector, either as labourers or as administrative and technical staff.{{sfn|Sandhu|2006|pages=172–173}}

Many Indians are also involved in business and trade, the majority of the privately owned businesses belong to the [[Chettiar]]s.{{sfn|Sandhu|2006|page=173–175}}  The Sikhs and other Punjabis were initially recruited by the British to serve in the police and armed forces, and while in modern times these areas are now dominated by Malays, the descendants of Sikhs and other Punjabi are now found in every sphere of the economy, in particular as professionals, and in the mercantile and money-lending business.{{sfn|Sandhu|2006|page=162}}

According to the [[Ninth Malaysia Plan]] report of 2006, Malaysian Indians also controlled only 1.2 percent of the corporate wealth in Malaysia, down from the previous figure of 1.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Osman, Mohamed Nawab Mohamed |date=2007|title= Marginalisation and the Indian Community in Malaysia|work= RSIS Commentaries, (131/2007) |publisher=Nanyang Technological University |url=https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/bitstream/handle/10220/6011/rsisc131-07.pdf?sequence=1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060404214547/http://www.epu.jpm.my:80/rm9/english/Chapter16.pdf |archivedate= 2 April 2006|url=http://www.epu.jpm.my:80/rm9/english/Chapter16.pdf |title=Ninth Malaysia Plan 2006-2010 |chapter=Chapter 16 - Achieving Growth with Distribution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
The [[Malaysian Indian Congress]] (MIC) is the oldest and largest Indian political party in Malaysia. It is a senior member of the ruling [[Barisan Nasional]] coalition. The [[All Malaysian Indian Progressive Front|Indian Progressive Front]] (IPF), another Indian-based party, is affiliated with Barisan Nasional but is not a formal member. The [[People's Progressive Party (Malaysia)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP) is technically a multiracial party but its membership is overwhelmingly Indian. It is a member of the Barisan Nasional. The opposition [[People's Justice Party]] (PKR) and [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) have a large Indian membership and have many Indian lawmakers. Both parties are members of the [[Pakatan Harapan]] coalition. The [[Socialist Party of Malaysia]] (PSM), a minor opposition party, has a strong Indian presence. The [[Hindu Rights Action Force]] (Hindraf) was formed in 2007 to address alleged racial discrimination against Indian Malaysians. It was banned after it staged a large anti-government rally in [[Kuala Lumpur]] in 2007. Hindraf's political wing is the [[Human Rights Party (Malaysia)|Human Rights Party]] (HRP). The [[Malaysian Indian Muslim Congress]] (KIMMA) is a party that represents the interests of the [[Indian Muslim]] community. There is the [[Punjabi Party of Malaysia]] (PPM) which represents Malaysia's Punjabi community. The [[Malaysian Ceylonese Congress]] (MCC) represents Malaysia's [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] community who are technically not Indian but often regarded as such by most Malaysians. Other Indian fringe parties include the pro-Barisan Nasional [[Malaysian Indian United Party]] (MIUP), [[Malaysia Makkal Sakti Party]] (MMSP) and the latest [[Malaysian Indian Justice Party]] (MIJP). There was also the [[Democratic Malaysian Indian Party]] (DMIP) which has been dissolved.

In the [[Malaysian general election, 2018|Malaysian general election]] held in 2018, sixteen Indians were elected to the [[Dewan Rakyat]]. This is the [[Ethnic Indians in the Dewan Rakyat|highest number of Malaysian Indians elected to parliament]] in Malaysian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://littleindia.com/malaysia-gets-16-indian-origin-members-of-parliament/|title=Malaysia Gets 16 Indian-Origin Members of Parliament|date=2018-05-15|work=Little India: Overseas Indian, NRI, Asian Indian, Indian American|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HINDRAF]] is a current ally to the present [[Pakatan Harapan]] government. This is in addition to [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|DAP]] and [[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|PKR]] which are multiracial parties with Indian representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/node/369691/amp|title=Malaysian Indians have dropped MIC, opt for multiracial parties|website=www.nst.com.my|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently [[Ethnic Indians in the Cabinet of Malaysia|4 ministers and 1 deputy minister]] from the Malaysian Indian community.

== Media and the performing arts ==
[[File:Indian Classical Dance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tamils#Performing arts|Tamil classical dance]], performed in Malaysia.]]
{{See also|Malaysian Tamil Cinema |Anugerah Industri Muzik Malaysian-Indian|Lists of Tamil-language media in Malaysia}}
Satellite television provider [[Astro (Malaysian satellite television)|Astro]] provides several [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[satellite television|satellite]] [[television channels]]. [[Astro Vaanavil]] and state-owned [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia|RTM]] [[TV2 (Malaysia)|TV2]] broadcast locally produced [[Tamil language|Tamil]] shows. [[India]]-based channels available in [[Malaysia]] are [[Sun TV (India)|Sun TV]], [[Jaya TV]], [[Chutti TV]]. Thanga Thirai and [[Velli Thirai]] are [[Tamil language|Tamil]] movie channels while [[B4U (network)|Astro B4U]] is a [[Hindi language|Hindi]] movie channel. The Malaysian Indian community is an important market for the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] film industry [[Kollywood]]. There are 2-[[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[radio stations]] of the state-owned [[Minnal FM]] and the privately owned [[THR.fm|THR Raaga]].

It is also customary for major Malaysian corporations to produce television commercials in conjunction with [[Deepavali]]. They generally pay tribute to the contributions of the Indian community to the nation and are well received by Indians of all faiths. The heart-warming Deepavali commercials by the state petroleum company [[Petronas]] are especially popular. Indian Malaysians have also contributed to the mainstream Malaysian entertainment industry. The Jayhawkers from Seremban led by one Joe Chelliah was the first non-Malay pop band with only Indian musicians that recorded popular commercial albums in Malay in the mid 1960s itself. More recent notable Indian Malaysian artists with multiracial appeal are [[Reshmonu]], [[Jaclyn Victor]], and [[Alleycats (Malaysian rock band)|Alleycats]]. Indian Malaysians have also made significant contributions to the Malaysian English theatre scene. Tamil [[hip hop]] was started in Malaysia by pioneers like rappers [[Chakra Sonic]], Yogi B and several others, which had since then made its way to Kollywood.

[[Bharata Natyam]], the Tamil classical dance of India, is an important feature of Tamil culture and is hence popular in Malaysia. Ramli Ibrahim and [[Mavin Khoo]] are two non-Indian Malaysians who are world-renowned [[Indian classical dance]] performers. The Temple of Fine Arts in Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur is an academy that provides training in traditional Indian dance and music. The [[urumi (drum)|urumee]] drums are often played at religious and cultural events. The [[nadaswaram]] is a traditional Indian wind instrument often played at Indian weddings in Malaysia.

==Cuisine==
{{Further|Malaysian Indian Cuisine}}
[[File:Bananaleafrice001.jpg|thumb| [[Banana leaf rice]].]]
The contribution of the Indian community to [[Malaysian cuisine]] is enormous. Indian cuisine has had a strong influence on traditional [[Malay cuisine]] resulting in the popularity of curries in Malaysia. Indian restaurants are well received by Malaysians from all ethnic and religious backgrounds. They have become an important fixture in everyday Malaysian life and are the venue of choice for watching live televised football matches. [[Mamak stall|Mamak]] restaurants and stalls refer to eateries owned and staffed by [[Indian Muslims]]. The word 'Mamak' is sometimes erroneously used to describe any Indian restaurant. [[Roti canai]], [[nasi kandar]], [[maggi goreng]] and [[pasembur]] (Mamak rojak) are Indian dishes unique to Malaysia. Nasi kandar is sold exclusively in [[Indian Muslim]] restaurants and the recipes are closely guarded secrets. Unlike Indian cuisine in the United Kingdom and other Western countries which tend to focus on [[North Indian cuisine]], Indian cuisine in Malaysia is largely based on [[South Indian cuisine]] as the Malaysian Indian diaspora is overwhelmingly Tamil, although some northern dishes such as [[tandoori chicken]] and [[naan]] bread are common. Southern breakfast delicacies such as [[idli]], [[vadai]] and [[dosa]] (spelled in Malaysia as 'thosai') are common. The [[appam]] is a favourite breakfast dish in Tamil homes. ''Idiyappam'' is known as [[putu mayam]] in Malay and usually sold by mobile motorcycle vendors. [[Murukku]] is made to mark [[Deepavali]]. Meals of rice with various vegetable and meat dishes along with other condiments are served on banana leaves in restaurants for lunch and dinner, and also in Indian households during special occasions. Mutton ([[goat meat]]) is highly favoured and served as either ''varuval'' (dry curry) or ''peratal'' (curry with a thick gravy). Fried bitter gourd, banana chips, [[papadam]], [[rasam]], yoghurt and pickles are the usual condiments. Desserts and sweets include [[payasam]], [[halva]], [[mysore pak]], palgoa and ghee balls.

The Indian community which mostly consist of [[Tamils]] follow Hinduism as the main faith. Hinduism and Buddhism were brought to the Malay Peninsula from India around the 2nd century AD . The Indian-influenced kingdoms of Kadaram ([[Early history of Kedah|Old Kedah]]), and Ilangosagam ([[Langkasuka]]) practised Hinduism and Buddhism during the rule of the Malay-[[Srivijaya]] and Tamil-[[Chola]] kingdoms.&lt;ref name=Arasaratnam1970&gt;{{cite book | last = Arasaratnam| first = Sinnappah|title = Indians in Malaysia and Singapore| year = 1970| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = London| pages = 4, 168, 169, 170, 171, &amp; 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early few Indians arrived and assimilated quickly into the local population through intermarriage.

The Chola King had also launched an attack via a naval expedition on several Malay Kingdoms. Subsequent to invasion, both Chola kingdom and south east Asian Hindu Buddhist kingdoms went into decline and many would later totally disappear, and kingdoms in Malaysia Indonesia were gradually Islamised. Hinduism is the most practiced religion amongst the Tamils, including both the major Hindu and Tamil pantheon of deities. Tamils of both Indian and Sri Lankan backgrounds practice Hinduism.

[[Sikhism]] is practiced mainly by [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]]. Many Sindhis also worship in Sikh Gurdwaras in Malaysia. Christianity is practiced by a minority of Tamil people. In Malaysia, most of the Indian Christians are either [[Catholic]], [[Anglican]], [[Methodist]], [[Lutheran]] or [[Evangelical]]. Trade contact with the Tamils predate the Islamic period (c. 570-632 AD), or the birth of Islam. Indonesians and Malays came to know about Islam initially through Gujarati merchants and further developed on by the Arab traders. Most of the Indian Muslim community has been absorbed into the larger Malay community due to their common religious background, with a substantially high level of assimilation and intermarriage between the communities. In Malaysia, [[Tamil Muslim]]s are often referred to as 'Mamaks' while [[Mappila|Malayalee Muslims]] are known as 'Kakas' or 'Malabaris'.

==Festivals==
[[File:Thaipusam idols.jpg|left|thumb|upright|left|Idols carried in procession during Thaipusam at Batu Caves.]]
One of the biggest Hindu festivals in Malaysia is [[Thaipusam]]. Thaipusam is dedicated to the Tamil deity [[Murugan]] which occurs on the day in the [[Hindu calendar|Tamil month]] of ''Thai'' (January–February) when the asterism ''Poosam'' is on the ascendant. It is celebrated in grand style in the temples of, [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Ipoh]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]] for three days.

In Kuala Lumpur, Thaipusam has become an almost national seat for ''Poosam'' celebrations. The venue of the Kuala Lumpur celebrations is a picturesque shrine right inside a cave that lies many feet above the ground, and can only be approached by a steep climb. This place, known as [[Batu Caves]], is about eight miles from the city, and a [[Temple car|chariot]] procession carrying the image of the deity to and from the place adds to the color and gaiety of the festival. Crowds from all over the country throng to the cave, including people of all classes and groups. It is above all a day of penance, on which all kinds of vows are fulfilled. A 42.7m high statue of Lord Murugan was built at Batu Caves and was unveiled in January 2006, having taken 3 years to construct.

One of the most significant rites performed is the carrying of the [[kavadi]], a large wooden decorated arch, as an act of penance. When deities are taken on procession from one shrine to another, they would be followed by a number of these voluntary kavadi-bearers. In other towns and estates, kavadis would be carried for other festivals like ''Chittirai Paruvam''. Some of the more rigid practitioners would bear spikes, spears, and hooks pierced into their bodies. The ''Chittirai Paruvam'' festival and festivals to the Tamil deity [[Mariamman]] are usually accompanied by a fire-walking ceremony.&lt;ref name=Arasaratnam1970/&gt;

[[Deepavali]], popularly known as the 'Festival of Lights', is another major Hindu festival which is celebrated by all Hindu communities. Tamils celebrate [[Pongal]] which is a harvest festival usually held from 13–16 January. A similar festival known as [[Makar Sankranti]] is celebrated by most other Indian communities while the Punjabis call their harvest festival [[Lohri]].

The Malayalees celebrate [[Vishu]], the Malayalee New Year which usually falls in the month of April or the month of Medam in the [[Malayalam calendar]]. [[Onam]] is the most popular festival celebrated by the Malayalee community and is usually observed in the month of August or September.

The Telugus celebrate [[Ugadi]], the Telugu New Year which is based on the [[lunar calendar]]; unlike [[Puthandu]], the Tamil New Year and [[Vasakhi]], the Sikh New Year which are based on the [[solar calendar]].[[Makar Sankranti]] is an important festival for [[Telugu people|Telugu]] community also celebrated as Pongal by Tamils.

The festivals celebrated by Malaysian Indians who profess the Christian faith are [[Easter]], [[Christmas]] and [[All Souls' Day]] (mainly celebrated by Catholics). Indian Muslims observe [[Ramadan]], the Muslim month of fasting; and celebrate [[Hari Raya Aidilfitri#South-East Asia|Hari Raya Aidilfitri]] and [[Eid al-Adha|Hari Raya Aidiladha]].

==Influence toward Malaysian Culture==
Indian influences could be seen on modern Malaysia as well as on traditional Malay culture. The diffusion of Indian culture is demonstrated with the following examples:

*[[Malay folklore]] contains a rich number of Indian-influenced mythological characters, such as [[Bidadari]], [[Jatayu|Jentayu]], [[Garuda]] and [[Nāga|Naga]].
*[[Malaysian literature|Early Malay literature]] was highly influenced by Indian epics, such as the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and the ''[[Ramayana]]''.
*[[Wayang]] shadow puppets and classical dance-dramas of Malaysia took stories from episodes of ''Ramayana'' and ''Mahabharata''.

===Language and names===
{{Main article|Tamil and Sanskrit inscriptions in the Malay world}}
A good number of Tamil inscriptions as well as Hindu and Buddhist icons emanating from South India have been found in Southeast Asia (and even in parts of [[Northern and southern China|south China]]). On the Malay Peninsula, inscriptions have been found at [[Takuapa]], not far from the [[Vishnuite]] statues of Khao Phra Narai in [[Southern Thailand]]. It is a short inscription indicating that an artificial lake named ''Avani-naranam'' was dug by ''nangur-Udaiyan'' which is the name of an individual who possessed a military [[fief]] at Nangur, being famous for his abilities as a warrior, and that the lake was placed under the protection of the members of the Manikkiramam (which according to K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, was a merchant guild) living in the military camp.&lt;ref name=Sastri1949&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sastri, K.A.

An inscription dated 779 AD has been found in [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom|Ligor]], Malay Peninsula.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Vatteluttu alphabet|South Indian characters]] of the 4th century AD, thus proclaiming the Buddhist character of the shrine near the find-spot (site I) of which only the basement survives. The inscriptions are on three faces in ''Pallava Grantha script''. The Ruler Raja Ganga fled from his empire into the forests with his queen and an infant heir. Raja Ganga left traces of hideout on a nearby hill in form of artefacts on stones. All these inscriptions, both [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Sanskrit]] ones, relate to the activities of the people and rulers of the Tamil country of South India. The [[Tamil script|Tamil inscriptions]] are at least four centuries posterior to the Sanskrit inscriptions, from which the early Tamils themselves were patronizers of the Sanskrit language.&lt;ref name=Arokiaswamy2000/&gt; The Cherok Tokun Ancient Inscriptions were first documented by Colonel James Low, a British army officer, in 1845. In his log, Low recorded his disappointment of not finding a more spectacular ruin, expecting to find an ancient temple ruin. He documented what he made out to be "a group of seven inscriptions". The inscriptions were believed to be in pre-Pallava script and written in Sanskrit. They were attributed to the ancient Kingdom of Kadaaram, which flourished in northern Malaysia in the 5th to 6th centuries. However, according to J Laidlay, who translated the text in 1848, the inscription was in fact written in [[Pali]] - another ancient language of the Indian subcontinent.

An element needed to carry out commercial transactions is a common language understood by all parties involved in early trade. Historians such as J.V. Sebastian, K.T. Thirunavukkarasu, and A.W. Hamilton record that Tamil was the common language of commerce in Malaysia and Indonesia during historical times.&lt;ref name="Arokiaswamy2000"/&gt; The maritime Tamil significance in Sumatran and Malay Peninsula trading continued for centuries and borrowings into Malay from Tamil increased between the 15th and 19th centuries due to their commercial activities. In the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company was obliged to use Tamil as part of its correspondence. In Malacca and other seaports up to the 19th century, Malay terminology pertaining to book-keeping and accountancy was still largely Tamil.&lt;ref name=Sneddon2003/&gt;

===Infrastructure===
Indians have contributed significantly to the building of Malaysia since the 19th century. The Indian workforce was instrumental in the clearing of land for infrastructure, established rubber plantations, built the roads, set up transmission lines as well as managed early Malayan railways, ports and airports. Indian doctors, chemists and veterinarians formed the bulk of medical personnel in Malaysia - their contributions still persist to present day. Indian civil servants formed the core of the civil service both pre- and post-independence. Indian teachers who were particularly fluent in the English language formed the backbone of Malaysian education, particularly in missionary schools. Indians also pioneered private education in Malaysia.

==Diaspora==
A number of Malaysian Indian immigrants are found in Australia, and they tended to be highly qualified and speak English fluently and were therefore highly employable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Australian People: An Encyclopedia of the Nation, Its People and Their Origins|last = Jupp|first = James|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2001|isbn = 9780521807890|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=wgoFxfSTfYAC&amp;pg=PA432 |pages = 432}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a small community of [[Indian Australian|Australians of Indian descent]] on the [[Australia]]n [[States and territories of Australia|external territory]] of [[Christmas Island]] who live alongside other Australians of ethnic Malaysian Chinese, Malay and European descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Australian People: An Encyclopedia of the Nation, Its People and Their Origins|last = Jupp|first = James|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2001|isbn = 9780521807890|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=wgoFxfSTfYAC&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages = 225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable people==
{{Main article|List of Malaysian Indians}}

Among the notable people of Indian descent in Malaysia are [[K. Thamboosamy Pillay]], a significant figure of early [[Kuala Lumpur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=L_hwAAAAMAAJ|title=A History of Kuala Lumpur 1856–1939|first=J.M. |last=Gullick|publisher=The Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|year=2000|pages=43, 135, 140}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karpal Singh]], [[V. David]] and [[Samy Vellu]], all prominent [[List of Malaysian politicians of Indian descent|Malaysian Indian politicians]]. A number of notable Malays, including [[Mahathir Mohamad]], also have part-Indian ancestry.

==Challenges for the future==

The '''Mills Observatory''' in [[Dundee]], Scotland, is the first purpose-built public [[astronomical observatory]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Mills Observatory Dundee, Leisure &amp; Culture Dundee, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Built in 1935, the observatory is classically styled in sandstone and has a distinctive 7&amp;nbsp;m dome, which houses a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] refracting [[telescope]], a small [[planetarium]], and display areas. The dome is one of two made from papier-mâché to survive in the UK, the other being at the [[Godlee Observatory]].

==Telescopes==
The main telescope is a 400mm (16inch) Dobsonian reflector that was acquired in 2013. The observatory also houses a Victorian 0.25m (10&amp;nbsp;inch) Cooke refractor, with a focal length of 3.75&amp;nbsp;m. It was made in York in 1871 by [[T. Cooke &amp; Sons|Thomas Cooke]] and the optical components are of the highest quality. The telescope is actually older than the building. The dome also houses a 0.3m (12&amp;nbsp;inch) [[Schmidt-Cassegrain]] telescope, which was purchased in 2006. When the Mills Observatory opened on 28 October 1935, it originally housed a 450mm (18&amp;nbsp;inch) reflecting telescope, constructed by the [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] based company of [[Grubb Parsons]]. The dome itself is made of papier-mâché with a steel frame, and was also supplied by Grubb Parsons. Refracting telescopes have long been regarded as the superior instrument for planetary observing. During the winter evening hours, given clear sky conditions, the telescope is used to show the public the night sky.

==Planetarium==
The planetarium is based around a Viewlex Apollo [[Image projector|projector]], which simulates the night sky on a domed roof in a darkened room. Around [[1000 (number)|1000]] [[star]]s are displayed, along with the naked eye planets and the [[Milky Way]]. Auxiliary units simulate a rotating [[galaxy]], and provide pictures of [[astronomy|astronomical]] objects. Seating is limited to 20 for public shows.

==Display Area==
The display area is split into two parts. The main area in the centre of the building at ground floor level provides changing displays of pictures and models, and also houses the observatory shop. The upper level provides displays of historic equipment and information of local importance.

==Balgay Hill==
{{main article|Balgay}}
[[File:Balgayparkmillsobserv.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mills Observatory in Balgay Hill]]
Mills Observatory is built upon the summit of the wooded Balgay Hill, in Balgay Park, one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[City Centre, Dundee|Dundee City Centre]]. The woods of Balgay Hill, surrounding the Observatory include [[Cypress]]es, [[Redwood]]s, [[Cedar wood|Cedars]] and Monkey Puzzles. [[Violet (plant)|Violets]] and [[Strawberry|Wild Strawberries]] can be found growing among the grass in season.

==Planet Trail==
[[File:Planettrailmillsobserv.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Planet Trail]]
On Balgay Hill, an outdoor planet trail, scale model of the [[solar system]], is arranged to entertain and educate the exploring visitor. The planet trail is a series of standing stones and plaques representing the solar system. The visitor starts with the sun on the eastern summit of the Hill, and following the trail to the west from the [[Sun]], in the direction of Mills Observatory, he or she will encounter another eight rocks representing the planets [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. [[Pluto]] is represented by the pier in the Mills Observatory, which supports the telescope there.

==History==
The history of the observatory starts with [[John Mills (entrepreneur)|John Mills]] (1806–1889), a manufacturer of linen and twine in the city of [[Dundee]], and a keen amateur [[astronomer]]. As a young man and a member of the Original Secession [[Kirk]], he had been greatly influenced by the [[Thomas Dick (scientist)|Reverend Thomas Dick]], [[philosopher]] and author of a number of books on [[Astronomy]] and [[Christian Philosophy]]. Dr Dick attempted to harmonize [[science]] and [[religion]], and believed that the greatness of God could best be appreciated by the study of astronomy, to which he devoted his life after a period as an ordained [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] at [[Methven, Perth and Kinross|Methven]]. He advocated that every city should have public parks, public libraries and a public observatory.

[[File:Rev thomas dick mills obs.jpg|thumb|left|200px|'''Rev. Thomas Dick''']]

Mills built his own private observatory on the slopes of [[Law, Dundee|Dundee Law]], near what is now Adelaide Place. An old print still exists showing the ruins of the building minus its [[dome]].  There would appear to have been, in addition to the main telescope, a transit room, and what was probably a study to record and write up his observations. The fact that he had a transit instrument signifies that he must have been doing timings of the passage of stars across the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]], and was not just a casual observer. One of John Mills'  [[telescopes|telescope]] is on display in the Visitor Centre attached to the [[Royal Observatory, Edinburgh]]. It is a brass instrument manufactured by George Lowden, a Dundee instrument-maker of that period, who supplied Mills with a number of his instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Thomas.

When [[Dundee City Council|Dundee Town Council]] received the bequest they were in something of a quandary. There was no precedent for any bequest of this nature, and their first thought was to offer the money to the [[University of Dundee|University College]], Dundee, in the hope that they would be able to fulfil its terms. They, in turn, sought expert opinion from, among others, the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]], regarding the feasibility of such a project. The advice they received envisaged that only very limited public access would be possible. Evidently the College decided that the project did not fit into their plans, so they declined the offer. A Trust was then set up with the Town Council, and plans were drawn up to build the Observatory on the summit of Dundee Law. However, the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 put the whole project in pause, and the site it was intended to occupy was instead reserved for the [[War Memorial]], which was erected after the end of hostilities. No further progress was made during the 1920s.

The onset of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] in the 1930s caused the matter to be raised once again, since it was felt that the project would provide much-needed work for the depressed building industry. [[Ralph Allen Sampson|Professor Sampson]],  [[Astronomer Royal for Scotland]], was brought in as consultant. After examining several sites he came down strongly in favour of [[Balgay|Balgay Hill]] as being by far the most suitable site, both in terms of astronomical suitability and for public access. This decision has stood the test of time, since other observatories have had their seeing conditions ruined by sodium lighting and other forms of modern pollution. The concept of a public observatory is, in a way, a contradiction in terms, since by definition, an observatory should be as far away from the public as possible. Most of the modern research observatories are situated on mountain-tops or desert areas. However, the geography of Dundee is unique, in that it has Balgay Hill overlooking a river estuary, protected from the main lights of the city by trees which also help to provide a purer atmosphere, and at the same time very accessible to the public. Something like 40% of all nights are observable.
[[File:Building of present mills observatory.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The building of the present '''Mills Observatory''']]
[[Ralph Allen Sampson|Professor Sampson]] collaborated with [[James MacLellan Brown]], the City Architect, in designing a much more modern building than the one originally planned  before the war. The structure is of sandstone blocks quarried from [[List of United Kingdom locations: La-Li#Lel-Lez|Leoch]], near Rosemill. The Observatory was formally opened by Professor Sampson on 28 October 1935, and presented to the Town Council by Mr. Milne of the Mills Trust in the presence of Lord Provost Buist. A message of congratulation was sent by the Astronomer Royal at Greenwich, Sir H. Spencer Jones. Articles on current celestial objects were written in the local press by the Reverend John Lees, who usually acted as chairman at public lectures given at the Observatory by visiting astronomers.
[[File:Jgrantbrucemillsobservatory.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''J. Grant Bruce''']]
The first [[Curator]] was J. Grant Bruce F.R.A.S., an instrument-maker from [[Newport-on-Tay|Newport]], [[Fife]]. This was a part-time post, with a small salary. A full-time caretaker, George Dorward, was also appointed. Hours of opening were fixed, with special arrangements for visiting parties, and for qualified persons at other times. In the winter evenings, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays were for the public, with Tuesdays and Thursdays reserved for private booked parties. During the day and throughout the summer, visitors could view the scenery from the balcony, using two four-inch (102&amp;nbsp;mm)  Turret telescopes by Ross, suitable for terrestrial viewing. These were excellent telescopes, also very suitable for wide-field, low-power astronomical work. Unfortunately these are no longer functioning and only parts of one remain.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Originaltelescopemillsobs.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The original {{convert|18|in|mm|sing=on}} Telescope]] --&gt;
In the dome, the original telescope given by the Mills Trust was an 18-inch (45&amp;nbsp;cm.) [[Newtonian telescope|Newtonian reflector]] by [[Grubb Parsons]], electrically driven. The dome itself, also built by Grubb, is hand-operated and made of [[papier-mâché]] on a framework of steel. The only part of the dome which has had to be replaced over the years is the shutter, where the papier-mâché perished and marine plywood was substituted. The 18-inch telescope was rarely used at full aperture, due to its tendency to be affected by reflections from street lights caused by the open lattice-work tube.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Finlay Freudlichmillsobser.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''Professor E. Finlay Freudlich''']] --&gt;
One of the problems that restricted the astronomical work of the Observatory during this period was that [[Balgay|Balgay Park]] was enclosed, and the gates were locked at dusk.  Special arrangements had to be made with the Parks Department to have a gatekeeper on duty during the nights when the telescope was in use, and for him to supervise entry and exit of public and cars, and ensure no-one was left in the park after the observatory was locked up.  This meant that all children had to be accompanied by an adult.  For this reason the Council placed the Observatory under the administrative control of the Parks Superintendent, under whom it remained until reorganisation brought a transfer to the [[Museum]]s Department. The railings were removed during the War, since when the park has had "open access."  During the years 1935 to 1939 there was one staff change - Mr. Dorward retired and was succeeded by Mr. McDonald. Shortly after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] the Observatory was closed for the duration and the staff re-deployed to work of more immediate national importance. After the war, when the Observatory re-opened, the {{convert|18|in|mm|sing=on}} telescope underwent a radical transformation. [[File:The 19-inch pilot modelmillsobserv.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The 19-inch (48cm) pilot model telescope]] [[Erwin Finlay-Freundlich|Professor E. Finlay Freundlich]] of [[St. Andrews University]], together with his colleagues R. Waland, W. Threadgill and Curator Bruce, were planning the half-scale pilot model of the 37-inch (95&amp;nbsp;cm) [[Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope|Schmidt Cassegrain reflecting telescope]] now installed in the [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] building at [[St. Andrews]]. This was of a much more advanced design than the [[UK Schmidt Telescope|standard Schmidt telescopes]] then in use. The Americans were also working on a similar design and the St. Andrews team were keen to be the first to have it in operation.
The problem was that they did not have a suitable mounting available in St. Andrews for the 19-inch (48&amp;nbsp;cm.) pilot model. They became interested in the Mills Observatory's [[Newtonian telescope]] as its mounting appeared ideally suited for their purpose. Permission was given by the Town Council for the Newtonian to be removed and the new instrument built in its place, on the assurance that:
"this would give Dundee a much superior instrument for direct public observation as the pilot instrument would be left permanently mounted in Dundee and available for public use."
[[File:The 10-inch Cooke Refractormills.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The {{convert|10|in|mm|sing=on}} Cooke refractor telescope]]
During the next three years the telescope room was closed to the public while the work proceeded. Only the balcony was available and observations were carried out with small instruments. The telescope was completed in 1950 and described as "the first of its kind in the world." Unfortunately, it was purely for photographic work, which rather contradicted the above assurance.
However, matters took a different course. The expansion of the city north and west and the development of [[sodium]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] street-lighting hampered the work of [[Constellation|stellar]] [[photography]], so in February, 1951  Bruce and Professor Freundlich suggested that the pilot telescope be transferred to St. Andrews University Observatory, eleven miles (18&amp;nbsp;km) to the south, for better conditions and proximity to the workshops. The Mills would then receive in exchange the 10-inch (25&amp;nbsp;cm.) Cooke refracting telescope formerly used as a student training instrument and now surplus to requirements. At first the Town Council refused, and there was much correspondence in the local press, and indignation among local amateurs, that the University should interfere with the affairs of a public institution.  [[William Michael Herbert Greaves|Professor W.H.M. Greaves]], had succeeded Professor Sampson as [[Astronomer Royal for Scotland]], was called upon to advise on the matter.  In view of the scientific benefits of the move, and lack of interest shown by University College, [[Dundee]], he recommended that the transfer take place. This was done at the University's expense, and on the understanding that the two telescopes were on mutual loan.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DrJaroslavCisarmillsobs.jpg|thumb|left|200px|'''Dr. Jaroslav Císař''']] --&gt;
The {{convert|10|in|mm|sing=on}} refractor had to be modified slightly to fit the Mills dome, and the dew-cap cannot safely be used.  However, it proved to be a much superior instrument for public viewing than the old [[Newtonian telescope|Newtonian reflector]]. Originally built in 1871 it was, at one time, privately owned by [[Walter Goodacre]], president of the [[British Astronomical Association]] (B. A. A.), who lived in the village of [[Four Marks]], near [[Winchester]]. The telescope was used there by many famous amateurs involved in the work of the B. A. A. and was always described by them as "the excellent 10-inch Cooke refractor".  It is particularly good for observing fine lunar and planetary detail and although not basically designed for photographic work, the lens is so good that, with modern cameras, good photographs can be taken. The Observatory has also acquired a number of smaller telescopes over the years.
[[File:Harryfordmillsobse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''Harry Ford''']][[File:Samspsonralphallen.jpg|thumb|right|'''Ralph Allen Sampson''']]
Sometime after the Cooke telescope was installed, Curator Bruce died. In the autumn of 1952, the Observatory resumed its public functions under a new [[Curator]], [[Jaroslav Císař]] D. Sc., F.R.A.S., a research astronomer at [[University of St Andrews|St. Andrews]] Dr. Císař, from [[Czechoslovakia]], soon aroused interest by his popular courses in astronomy at the [[adult education]] classes and encouraged young amateurs, including a number who became active in the Dundee Astronomical Society (D. A . S.), which was formed a few years later.  He and A.S. Dow, Superintendent of the Parks Department, allowed the Society the use of the lecture-room of the Observatory for meetings. Dr. Císař, because of his St. Andrews commitments, could only devote a limited time to working at the Mills Observatory. In view of this, one of the keenest of the local amateurs, Harry Ford, a technician at Queen's College, became his assistant, and acted as Curator in Dr. Císař's absence. When eventually Dr. Cisar retired he recommended that Mr. Ford be appointed as his successor. This was agreed to by the Council so Ford took up his duties in 1967, first of all on a part-time basis, but eventually on a full-time contract. He was accordingly the first full-time Curator of the Mills Observatory in 1972. This meant that the Observatory could, for the first time, operate on a full-time basis. The D.A.S. became involved in work of the Observatory with the stimulation and encouragement given by Ford, who had inaugurated a programme for the instruction of the public using visual aids and experimental techniques.  He also built up interest by excellent public relations work, so that the Observatory attracted attention throughout the world of [[amateur astronomy]]. A number of exhibitions and "Open Days" were held at which the work of the local amateurs was exhibited.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Open Day at the Mills Observatory.jpg|thumb|left|220px|'''Open Day at the Mills Observatory''']] --&gt;
Ford also organised displays of the work of the Observatory and the local Society at the B.A.A.’s Exhibition Meetings in [[London]], which excited great interest among the assembled amateurs, and resulted in many of them making a special journey to [[Dundee]] during their holidays. [[Patrick Moore|Dr. Patrick Moore]], well known [[TV]] and [[Radio broadcasting|radio]] personality, praised the work of the Observatory as being "quite unique in his experience." He himself has visited the Observatory on a number of occasions. The period from 1971 to 1977 was a particularly fruitful one in the history of the Observatory. This was the period of the great upsurge of interest due to the space spectaculars of the [[USSR]] and United States, culminating in the [[Project Apollo|Apollo missions]] to the [[Moon]]. In July 1969, during the period of the [[Apollo 11]] landing on the Moon, the Observatory witnessed the largest gathering of people in its history, when a [[Television|colour TV]] was installed in the lecture-room giving full coverage of the mission, interspersed with talks, slide-shows, and an exhibition, stewarded by members of the D.A.S.

Another significant event which stimulated local press interest was the expedition by Ford, Morgan Findlay and Dave Taylor to observe the 1973 total [[solar eclipse]] off the coast of [[Mauretania]], as part of the B. A . A . organised cruise on the ship "Monte Umbe", covered for the [[BBC|B.B.C]] by [[Patrick Moore]] and shown on his "Sky at Night" programme on television. The photographs obtained as a result of this trip form an important part of the Observatory archives.

In 1971, a meeting of Scottish astronomical societies was held in the Observatory, and a civic reception given to the delegates from all parts of Scotland. This was to be the first of a series of important meetings hosted by the Observatory. Possibly the greatest highlight of this entire period was the "Out of London" meeting of the B. A. A. held on 25 September 1975 at the [[University of Dundee]], which was organised by Harry Ford and the D.A.S., followed by a public lecture at night given by [[Patrick Moore]] on the subject of [[Mars]]. This attracted such a wide interest that the hall was packed to overflowing and many had to be turned away.

The [[moon|Lunar]] Section of the B.A.A. met at the Mills Observatory on a number of occasions. At one such meeting in June 1972, Patrick Moore presented to the Observatory the original manuscript of [[Walter Goodacre|Walter Goodacre’s]] observations of the [[Moon]] made with the {{convert|10|in|mm|sing=on}} refractor, when it was in his ownership, saying that it was only fitting that the [[manuscript]] should be where the [[telescope]] was.
Harry Ford succeeded Patrick Moore as Director of the B.A.A. Lunar Section in 1976, with Findlay and Taylor as co-ordinators. Most of the work was carried out by local members of the Section, with the co-operation of the [[Museum]]s Department. However, in November 1977, due to pressure of work, Ford resigned his Directorship.

During this period also the public work of the Observatory received a great boost, with many more visitors and parties of children and adults.  Particular use of the facilities was made by school classes and youth groups. Ford extended the Observatory's displays by construction of many models including various [[spacecraft|space-crafts]]. He was also responsible for an important addition to the Observatory's facilities, namely the 12-seat [[planetarium]] or artificial sky, which he built himself from various oddments, and which proved a great attraction in its own right, particularly for the younger visitors, and for school parties. Although it has now been supplemented by a commercially-made planetarium which can accommodate larger parties, Ford's original planetarium is still used regularly for small groups of visitors. Dick Kennedy, the longest-serving caretaker of the Observatory, who began after McDonald left in the 1950s and continued until his retirement in 1973. He was succeeded as caretaker by Jim Richardson, who retired the following year.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Gary HannanMillsObservatory.jpg|thumb|left|200px|'''Gary Hannan''']] --&gt;
From then on the post was combined with that of Assistant to the [[Curator]], and Thomas Flood took over that position.  In February 1982, due to domestic circumstances, Ford resigned from his post as Curator and moved south. During his period Thomas Flood served as the Curator,latterly re-designated as City Astronomer. Ford was succeeded in October of that year by the present City Astronomer, Dr. Fiona Vincent, a research astronomer from [[University of St. Andrews|St. Andrews]]. Thomas Flood retired later that same year and Gary Hannan, A former member of the D.A.S., took over astronomer's Assistant in February 1983.

[[File:Fiona Vincent and Dr. Patrick MooreMills Observ.jpg|thumb|right|220px|'''Dr. Patrick Moore and Fiona Vincent''']]

The 1982–1983 season was memorable in that the D. A. S. Winter lectures included one by the current Director of the Royal Observatory, [[Edinburgh]], and [[Astronomer Royal]] for Scotland, [[Malcolm Longair]], a native of [[Dundee]]. Dr. Patrick Moore also paid another visit to the Observatory in connection h a highly successful meeting of Scottish societies affiliated to the B.A.A., hosted by the Dundee society - one of a continuing series of astronomical meetings held at the Observatory.
The following year saw the inauguration of great changes at the Observatory, the net result of which improved the structure and facilities in a marked way the installation of [[central heating]], the re-surfacing of the balcony, the general redecoration of the whole building, and the upgrading of the lecture-room to an audio-visual theatre with carpeted flooring. This, together with the development of the display area and sales section, was made possible by a grant from the [[Scottish Tourist Board]], and meant the greatest upheaval since the Observatory was built. Despite this the work of the Observatory continued uninterrupted and indeed it hosted a record number of booked parties and casual visitors, a tribute to the efforts of the Astronomer and her Assistant.
The social high point of 1984 for the Observatory occurred on June 21, with the official opening of the new improved facilities by [[Patrick Moore|Dr. Patrick Moore]] in the presence of the [[Lord Provost]], civic dignitaries, the Curator of Museums, Adam Ritchie, members of the Museums staff and invited guests.  In his speech Dr. Moore predicted that in the future, as in the past, the Mills Observatory would play a great part in the furtherance of [[amateur astronomy]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and inspire some to take up [[astronomy]] as a career.

===1986–2007===
[[File:Oaktreemillsobservatory.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Red Oak, planted on 25 February 2004 by H R H The Princess Royal to commemorate her visit to view the improvements to the Mills Observatory]]
* The  booklet '''''The Mills Observatory -A Historical Survey'''''  by Thomas Flood was published in 1986, while Dr. Fiona Vincent was in charge.
* Dr. Vincent resigned in 1989 and was succeeded by her assistant, Mr. Brian Kelly.
* Mr. Kelly remained in post until 1999 when he resigned and the position was taken up by Mr Jeff Lashley, who remained in charge of the Observatory until November 2001.
* [[William Samson|Dr. Bill Samson]] took up the post of Heritage Officer (Mills Observatory) in February 2002 and became part-time Heritage Officer at the Mills in October 2004.
* Mr. Ken Kennedy was employed to work on the winter evenings when Dr Samson was not in attendance at the observatory.
* In 2003 the observatory was extensively refurbished with the support of the Heritage Lottery Fund.  Disabled access and other facilities were added at that time.  It was re-opened in February 2004 by HRH the Princess Royal.
* A 350-metre Planet Trail, in the form of standing stones with plaques to represent the planets, was opened by Professor John Brown, Astronomer Royal for Scotland, in June 2004.  This extends from the East summit of Balgay Hill (the ‘[[Sun]]’) to the Mills Observatory (‘[[Pluto]]’).  At the same time as the trail was constructed its surroundings were sympathetically landscaped and a new viewpoint established on the East summit.
* In 2005 the Mills Observatory had its first visit from an Apollo [[Astronaut]].  [[David Scott|Colonel David Scott]], commander of [[Apollo 15]] visited the Observatory on 12 April.
* March 13, 2007 Dr. Bill Samson's retirement.

===Minor planets===
While attending St. Andrews University, the astronomer [[Robert H. McNaught]] was a regular visitor to the Observatory and became a friend of Harry Ford. In 1990 he discovered two minor planets, [[List of minor planets: 6001–7000#901|6906 Johnmills and 6907 Harry Ford]], which he named after John Mills and Harry Ford.

'''Answer of Miss Earth 2008:''' "What I would tell to the newly elected president of the USA, being one of the most powerful countries in the world, I would encourage him to implement environmental knowledge in the curriculum of all schools whether in the United States or in the Philippines.

The '''New Zealand Esperanto Association''' ('''NZEA'''; {{lang-eo|Nov-Zelanda Esperanto-Asocio}}; [[Māori language|Māori]]: ''Te Rōpū o Aotearoa mō te Reo o te Ao'') is the national [[Esperanto]] association of [[New Zealand]]. It is an [[incorporated society]] and affiliated with the [[Universal Esperanto Association]].

==History==

NZEA was founded in Auckland on 1 February 1910. The first president of the Association was Mr George Aldridge of Auckland. Dr [[L. L. Zamenhof]] agreed to be the Honorary President. The then Prime Minister of New Zealand, Sir [[Joseph Ward]] and George Fowler M.P. became patrons of the Association.

During the First World War, the association ceased to exist. It was revived in 1928 under a new President Mr (later Professor) C. [[John Adcock]].

In 1983, the [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]] granted NZEA the status of [[charitable organisation]].

==Annual congress==
The New Zealand Esperanto Association generally arranges an annual Esperanto congress. The congress is usually of 3 to 5 days duration and occurs usually in January or February. About every fourth year NZEA has a combined congress with the [[Australian Esperanto Association]], either in New Zealand or Australia. In January 2008, ''Oceanea Congress'' took place in Auckland with many Esperantists from Australia and other countries. There were classes in the Esperanto language for beginners, learners and fluent speakers. There were also sessions about the language, entertainment and the annual meeting of the Association.

==Publications==
The official journal of NZEA is called ''Esperanto sub la Suda Kruco''. It is published jointly with the Australian Esperanto Association. NZEA publishes a member newsletter called ''Arĝenta Filiko'', usually twice a year. It aims principally to inform members about congress arrangements.

:''See also [[Oxford Pro Musica Singers]].''

The practical 'One Page Management System' (OPMS) has evolved to enable 'people-at-large' and experts design and implement effective systems of all kinds.

GS Chandy invented ‘One Page Management System’ (OPMS) sometime in 1981-82, based on the seminal contributions to systems science by the late John John N. Warfield - and has been developing it every since.

OPMS springs naturally from Interactive Management (IM), the powerful system methodologies that derive from Professor [[John N. Warfield]]’s “structural approach to system design”.

The application of the method also has been carried forward and codified by other entrepreneurial practitioners in worldwide applications, and an illustration of the scope of penetration of the method has recently been summarized &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harnessingcollectivewisdom.com Harness Collective Wisdom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Alexander Christakis]], a long-standing collaborator of Dr. [[John N. Warfield]].

Interactive Management consists of tools to:
* Help users 'generate ideas' – through systematically developed methods of brainstorming;
* ‘Structure’ (or organize) ideas generated as needed for effective resolution of problems identified.

OPMS now enables all of the above to be done by 'people-at-large' as well as by experts to create and implement truly usable systems of all kinds - individual, organisational or societal.

In brief, OPMS enables individual and group users to:

1.  Choose an appropriate 'Mission' depending on problem-situation confronted;

2.   Identify the issue or problem confronted –  this naturally provides a simple 'Mission statement';

3.  *Integrate* all the good ideas available to tackle the problem or issue at hand – with a view to enable accomplishment of the chosen Mission.  (Integrating 'good ideas' includes getting rid of the bad ideas that are always cluttering up the 'mindspace' – think about it and this will be obvious to you).

That's it!

And that's what the OPMS all about!

Just 'integrating' your available good ideas (AND getting rid of your bad ideas)!!

[Of course, it often is quite a job to decide which are the 'good' ideas and which are the 'bad' ideas – but OPMS helps users arrive at sound decisions, via effective debate between stakeholders to the chosen issue/Mission].

The structuring tools of OPMS  have developed from the powerful 'systems modeling' tools invented by Warfield in a three-decade long study of “complexity in systems and how to enable people to cope with it” - made easy to use for the 'people-at-large'.

These tools are:
* Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM); and
* Field Representation &amp; Profiling Method (FRP).
(Now rendered understandable by any high-school student within a couple of hours, and practically applicable by him/her/them to issues of practical concern within a couple of weeks [at most]).

More information about the OPMS can be sent if desired as attachments to an email message if you'll send an inquiry to gs_chandy_AT_yahoo.com - this information will include:

-- brief description of the OPMS; 
-- 'provenance'; 
-- 'Missions' to which OPMS has been successfully employed (and also some Missions where OPMS has not been successful yet; 
-- a sizable listing of possible Missions); 
-- an illustration of the kind of a systems model (and Interpretive Structural Model [ISM]), which can readily be developed into Action Planning along with all needed subsystems to help accomplish any chosen Mission.

(Limited) guidance can also be provided to help interested users initiate Action Planning on any chosen Mission - and copies of the prototype OPMS software would be freely provided - no fees or charges of any kind whatsoever.

'''Richard Julius Herrnstein''' (May 20, 1930 – September 13, 1994) was an American psychologist and sociologist. He was an active researcher in animal learning in the [[BF Skinner|Skinnerian]] tradition. He was one of the founders of the [[Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior]].

==Early life and education==
Richard Herrnstein was born on 20 May 1930, in New York City, to a family of Jewish Hungarian immigrants;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Ohles|editor-first1=Frederik |editor-last2=Ohles|editor-first2=Shirley M.  |editor-last3= Ramsay |editor-first3= John G. |title=Biographical Dictionary of Modern American Educators |place=Westport, CT |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1997 |pages=154–155 |chapter=Herrnstein, Richard Julius |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PBj5-zHEMvoC&amp;pg=PA154 |isbn=9780313291333}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Flora Irene (née Friedman) and Rezso Herrnstein, a housepainter.&lt;ref name="SEAL"/&gt; He was educated at the [[High School of Music &amp; Art]] and the [[City College of New York]], receiving a B.A. from the latter in 1952. In 1955, Herrnstein obtained his Ph.D. at [[Harvard University]], with a thesis titled ''Behavioral Consequences of the Removal of a Discriminative Stimulus Associated with Variable-Interval Reinforcement''.&lt;ref name="SEAL"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gordon |first=Nancy M. |editor-last=Jackson |editor-first=Kenneth T. |title=The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives |place=New York|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |year=2001 |pages=240–241 |chapter=Herrnstein, Richard Julius |chapter-url= https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/herrnstein-richard-julius |volume=4|isbn=9780684806440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewprom.50webs.com/JewPromSite_files/sheet018.htm|title=Jewish Members of American Academy of Arts and Sciences|website=JewProm|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
His major research finding as an experimental psychologist is the [[matching law]], the tendency of animals to allocate their choices in direct proportion to the rewards they provide. To illustrate the phenomenon, if there are two sources of reward, one of which is twice as rich as the other, Herrnstein found that animals often chose at twice the frequency the alternative that was seemingly twice as valuable. That is known as  matching, both in quantitative analysis of behavior and [[mathematical psychology]]. He also developed [[melioration theory]] with William Vaughan, Jr.

He was the Edgar Pierce Professor of [[psychology]] at [[Harvard University]] and worked with Skinner in the Harvard pigeon lab, where he did research on choice behavior and [[behavioral economics]]. In 1965, and with [[Edwin Boring]], Herrnstein wrote ''A Source Book in the History of Psychology''.

===Intelligence===
Herrnstein's research focused first on natural concepts and [[human intelligence]] in the 1970s, and peaked in prolificacy with the publication of his and [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray's]] controversial best-selling book, ''[[The Bell Curve]]''. Herrnstein died of cancer shortly before the book was released.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Five levels of classification capacities: discrimination, rote, open-ended categorization, concepts, and abstract relations (Herrnstein, 1990).

== Matching law ==
{{further|Matching law}}
Perhaps his most notable accomplishment was the formulation of the matching law: choices are distributed according to rates of reinforcement for making the choices. An instance for two choices can be stated mathematically as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{r_1}{r_1 + r_2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are rates of response for two alternative responses, and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are rates of reinforcement for the same two responses. Behavior conforming to this law is matching, and explanations of matching and of departures from matching are a large and important part of the literature on behavioral choice.

==Personal life==
Herrnstein married his first wife, Barbara Brodo, on 28 May 1951. The couple had a daughter together, Julia, before their divorce in February 1961. Through his second marriage to Susan Chalk Gouinlock, on 11 November 1961, he fathered two sons named Max and James.&lt;ref name="SEAL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goleman|first=Daniel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/16/obituaries/richard-herrnstein-64-dies-backed-nature-over-nurture.html|title=Richard Herrnstein, 64, Dies; Backed Nature Over Nurture|work=The New York Times|date=16 September 1994|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudolph Carl Lambert''' was an [[U.S. citizenship|American citizen]] and head of the California [[Communist Party]] Labor Commission and also headed of its security section in the 1940s.  Lambert first fell under [[FBI]] scrutiny in connection with its [[History of Soviet espionage in the United States#Secret apparatus|Comintern Apparatus]] investigation. Lambert is named in a 1945 San Francisco [[KGB]] cable intercepted and deciphered by the [[Venona project]] discussing information about uranium deposits in Western states.

Lambert figured prominently in the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]]'s investigation and decision to relieve Dr. [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], Director of the [[Manhattan Project]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]], of his [[security clearance]] because of documented close associations which Oppenheimer repeatedly denied, yet ultimately admitted to.  In a subsection review 'As to "character"' on 29 June 1954 in the ''Decision in the Matter of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer'', the Commission wrote,

:&lt;blockquote&gt;(3) In 1943, Dr. Oppenheimer indicated to Colonel Lansdale that he did not know Rudy Lambert, a [[CPUSA|Communist Party]] functionary. In fact, Dr. Oppenheimer asked Colonel Lansdale what Lambert looked like. Now, however, Dr. Oppenheimer under oath has admitted that be knew and had seen Lambert at least half a dozen times prior to 1943; he supplied a detailed description of Lambert; he said that once or twice he had lunch with Lambert and [[Isaac Folkoff]], another Communist Party functionary, to discuss his (Oppenheimer's) contributions to the Communist Party; and that he knew at the time that Lambert was an official in the Communist Party (Tr. pp. 139, 140, 877).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Sasanian Empire was founded by [[Ardashir I]], after the fall of the Parthian Empire and the defeat of the last [[Arsacid]] king, [[Artabanus V of Parthia|Artabanus V]]. At its greatest extent, the Sasanian Empire encompassed all of today's [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Eastern Arabia]] ([[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Qatif]], [[Qatar]], [[UAE]]), the [[Levant]] ([[Syria]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]]), the [[Caucasus]] ([[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Dagestan]]), [[Egypt]], large parts of [[Turkey]], much of [[Central Asia]] ([[Afghanistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]]), [[Yemen]] and [[Pakistan]]. According to a legend, the [[vexilloid]] of the Sasanian Empire was the [[Derafsh Kaviani]].&lt;ref name="Derafš-e Kāvīān"&gt;Khaleghi-Motlagh, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/derafs-e-kavian- Derafš-e Kāvīān]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sasanian Empire during [[Late Antiquity]] is considered to have been one of Iran's most important and influential historical periods and constituted the last great Iranian empire before the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Muslim conquest]] and the [[Islamization of Iran|adoption of Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Hourani, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, the Sasanian period witnessed the peak of ancient [[Persian culture|Iranian civilisation]]. The Sasanians' cultural influence extended far beyond the empire's territorial borders, reaching as far as [[Western Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;Will Durant, ''Age of Faith'', (Simon and Schuster, 1950), 150; ''Repaying its debt, Sasanian art exported it forms and motives eastward into India, Turkestan, and China, westward into Syria, Asia Minor, Constantinople, the Balkans, Egypt, and Spain.''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transoxiana.com.ar/0104/sasanians.html |title=Transoxiana 04: Sasanians in Africa |publisher=Transoxiana.com.ar |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarfaraz, pp. 329–330&lt;/ref&gt; It played a prominent role in the formation of both [[Medieval art|European]] and [[History of Eastern art|Asian]] medieval art.&lt;ref name="Iransaga: The art of Sassanians"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artarena.force9.co.uk/sass2.htm |title=Iransaga: The art of Sassanians |publisher=Artarena.force9.co.uk |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of what later became known as [[Islamic culture]] in art, architecture, music and other subject matter was transferred from the Sasanians throughout the [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref&gt;Abdolhossein Zarinkoob: ''Ruzgaran: tarikh-i Iran az aghz ta saqut saltnat Pahlvi'', page 305&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflicting accounts shroud the details of the fall of the [[Parthian Empire]] and subsequent rise of the Sassanian Empire in mystery.&lt;ref name=Fyre461&gt;{{Harvnb|Frye|2005|p=461}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sassanian Empire was established in [[Estakhr]] by [[Ardashir I]].

[[Papak]] was originally the ruler of a region called Khir. However, by the year 200 he had managed to overthrow [[Gochihr]] and appoint himself the new ruler of the [[Bazrangids]]. His mother, Rodhagh, was the daughter of the provincial governor of [[Fars Province|Pars]]. Papak and his eldest son Shapur managed to expand their power over all of Pars. The subsequent events are unclear, due to the elusive nature of the sources. It is certain, however, that following the death of Papak, Ardashir, who at the time was the governor of [[Darabgerd]], became involved in a power struggle of his own with his elder brother Shapur. Sources reveal that Shapur, leaving for a meeting with his brother, was killed when the roof of a building collapsed on him. By the year 208, over the protests of his other brothers who were put to death, Ardashir declared himself ruler of Pars.&lt;ref name=Farrokh178&gt;{{harvnb|Farrokh|2007|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarinkoob|1999|p=194&amp;nbsp;198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Ardashir was appointed ''[[shahanshah]]'', he moved his capital further to the south of Pars and founded [[Ardashir-Khwarrah]] (formerly ''Gur'', modern day [[Firuzabad, Fars|Firuzabad]]). The city, well protected by high mountains and easily defensible due to the narrow passes that approached it, became the centre of Ardashir's efforts to gain more power. It was surrounded by a high, circular wall, probably copied from that of Darabgird. Ardashir's palace was on the north side of the city; remains of it are extant. After establishing his rule over Pars, Ardashir rapidly extended his territory, demanding fealty from the local princes of Fars, and gaining control over the neighbouring provinces of [[Kerman province|Kerman]], [[Isfahan Province|Isfahan]], [[Susa|Susiana]] and [[Mesene]]. This expansion quickly came to the attention of Artabanus V, the Parthian king, who initially ordered the governor of Khuzestan to wage war against Ardashir in 224, but Ardashir was victorious in the ensuing battles. In a second attempt to destroy Ardashir, Artabanus himself met Ardashir in battle at Hormozgan, where the former met his death. Following the death of the Parthian ruler, Ardashir went on to invade the western provinces of the now defunct Parthian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farrokh|2007|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bas relief nagsh-e-rostam al.jpg|thumb|left|Rock-face relief at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] of Persian emperor Shapur I (on horseback) capturing Roman emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] (standing) and [[Philip the Arab]] (kneeling), suing for peace, following the victory at [[Battle of Edessa|Edessa]].]]

At that time the Arsacid dynasty was divided between supporters of [[Artabanus V of Parthia|Artabanus V]] and [[Vologases VI of Parthia|Vologases VI]], which probably allowed Ardashir to consolidate his authority in the south with little or no interference from the Parthians. Ardashir was aided by the geography of the province of Fars, which was separated from the rest of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frye|2005|p-465&amp;nbsp;466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowned in 224 at [[Ctesiphon]] as the sole ruler of Persia, Ardashir took the title ''shahanshah'', or "King of Kings" (the inscriptions mention [[Adhur-Anahid]] as his [[Banbishnan banbishn]], "Queen of Queens", but her relationship with Ardashir has not been fully established), bringing the 400-year-old Parthian Empire to an end, and beginning four centuries of Sassanid rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frye|2005|p=466&amp;nbsp;467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next few years, local rebellions occurred throughout the empire. Nonetheless, Ardashir I further expanded his new empire to the east and northwest, conquering the provinces of [[Sistan]], [[Gorgan]], [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], [[Merv|Margiana]] (in modern [[Turkmenistan]]), [[Balkh]] and [[Khwarezmia|Chorasmia]]. He also added [[Bahrain]] and [[Mosul]] to Sassanid's possessions. Later Sassanid inscriptions also claim the submission of the Kings of [[Kushan]], [[Turan]] and [[Mekran]] to Ardashir, although based on numismatic evidence it is more likely that these actually submitted to Ardashir's son, the future [[Shapur I]]. In the west, assaults against [[Hatra]], [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] and [[Adiabene]] met with less success. In 230, Ardashir raided deep into Roman territory, and a Roman counter-offensive two years later ended inconclusively, although the [[Roman emperor]], [[Alexander Severus]], celebrated a triumph in [[Roman Empire|Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre605.html |title=5.1-6 |publisher=Livius.org |date=2007-07-08 |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dodgeon-Greatrex-Lieu|2002|p=24&amp;nbsp;28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frye|1993|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HumiliationValerianusHolbein.jpg|thumb|The Humiliation of Valerian by Shapur ([[Hans Holbein the Younger]], 1521, pen and black ink on a chalk sketch, [[Kunstmuseum Basel]])]]

Ardashir I's son Shapur I continued the expansion of the empire, conquering [[Bactria]] and the western portion of the Kushan Empire, while leading several campaigns against Rome. Invading [[Roman Mesopotamia]], Shapur I captured [[Harran|Carrhae]] and [[Nisibis]], but in 243 the Roman general [[Gaius Furius Sabinius Aquila Timesitheus|Timesitheus]] defeated the Persians at [[Battle of Resaena|Rhesaina]] and regained the lost territories.&lt;ref name="Frye125"&gt;{{harvnb|Frye|1993|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Gordian III]]'s (238–244) subsequent advance down the [[Euphrates]] was defeated at [[Battle of Misiche|Meshike]] (244), leading to Gordian's murder by his own troops and enabling Shapur to conclude a highly advantageous peace treaty with the new emperor [[Philip the Arab]], by which he secured the immediate payment of 500,000 ''[[denarii]]'' and further annual payments.

Shapur soon resumed the war, defeated the Romans at [[Battle of Barbalissos|Barbalissos]] (253), and then probably took and plundered [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name="Frye125"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Southern|2001|p=235&amp;nbsp;236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman counter-attacks under the emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] ended in disaster when the Roman army was defeated and besieged at [[Battle of Edessa|Edessa]] and Valerian was captured by Shapur, remaining his prisoner for the rest of his life. Shapur celebrated his victory by carving the impressive rock reliefs in [[Naqsh-e Rostam]] and [[Bishapur]], as well as a monumental inscription in Persian and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] in the vicinity of [[Persepolis]]. He exploited his success by advancing into [[Anatolia]] (260), but withdrew in disarray after defeats at the hands of the Romans and their [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] ally [[Odaenathus]], suffering the capture of his harem and the loss of all the Roman territories he had occupied.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frye|1993|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Southern||2001p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Spread of Manicheanism.png|alt=|left|thumb|326x326px|The spread of Manichaeism (300–500)&lt;ref&gt;World History Atlas, Dorling Kindersly&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Shapur had intensive development plans. He ordered the construction of the [[Band-e Kaisar|first dam bridge in Iran]] and founded many cities, some settled in part by emigrants from the Roman territories, including Christians who could exercise their faith freely under Sassanid rule. Two cities, [[Bishapur]] and [[Nishapur]], are named after him. He particularly favoured [[Manichaeism]], protecting [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (who dedicated one of his books, the [[Shabuhragan]], to him) and sent many Manichaean missionaries abroad. He also befriended a [[Babylon]]ian rabbi called [[Samuel of Nehardea|Samuel]].

This friendship was advantageous for the [[Jewish]] community and gave them a respite from the oppressive laws enacted against them. Later kings reversed Shapur's policy of religious tolerance. When Shapur's son [[Bahram I]] acceded to the throne, he was pressured by the [[Zoroastrian]] high-priest [[Kartir]] [[Bahram I]] to kill Mani and persecute his followers. [[Bahram II]] was also amenable to the wishes of the Zoroastrian priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarinkoob|1999|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frye|1968|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign, the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon was sacked by the Romans under Emperor [[Carus]], and most of Armenia, after half a century of Persian rule, was ceded to [[Diocletian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarinkoob|1999|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Succeeding [[Bahram III]] (who ruled briefly in 293), [[Narseh]] embarked on another war with the Romans. After an early success against the Emperor [[Galerius]] near [[Raqqa|Callinicum]] on the Euphrates in 296, he was eventually decisively defeated by them. Galerius had been reinforced, probably in the spring of 298, by a new contingent collected from the empire's [[Danubian]] holdings.&lt;ref name="BNSCE18"&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Narseh did not advance from Armenia and [[Mesopotamia]], leaving Galerius to lead the offensive in 298 with an attack on northern Mesopotamia via Armenia. Narseh retreated to Armenia to fight Galerius's force, to the former's disadvantage: the rugged Armenian terrain was favourable to Roman infantry, but not to Sassanid cavalry. Local aid gave Galerius the advantage of surprise over the Persian forces, and, in two successive battles, Galerius secured victories over Narseh.&lt;ref name="Barnes, p. 18"&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', p. 18; Potter, ''The Roman Empire at Bay'', p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caucasus 300 map alt de.png|thumb|Rome and satellite kingdom of Armenia around 300, after Narseh's defeat]]

During the second encounter, Roman forces seized Narseh's camp, his treasury, his harem, and his wife.&lt;ref name="Barnes, p. 18"/&gt; Galerius advanced into [[Media (region)|Media]] and [[Adiabene]], winning successive victories, most prominently near [[Erzurum]], and securing Nisibis ([[Nusaybin]], Turkey) before October 1, 298. He then advanced down the [[Tigris]], taking Ctesiphon. Narseh had previously sent an ambassador to Galerius to plead for the return of his wives and children. Peace negotiations began in the spring of 299, with both Diocletian and Galerius presiding.

The conditions of the peace were heavy: Persia would give up territory to Rome, making the Tigris the boundary between the two empires. Further terms specified that Armenia was returned to Roman domination, with the fort of Ziatha as its border; [[Caucasian Iberia]] would pay allegiance to Rome under a Roman appointee; Nisibis, now under Roman rule, would become the sole conduit for trade between Persia and Rome; and Rome would exercise control over the five satrapies between the Tigris and Armenia: Ingilene, Sophanene ([[Sophene]]), Arzanene ([[Aghdznik]]), [[Corduene]], and Zabdicene (near modern [[Hakkâri]], Turkey).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njwgd7YZHi8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=roman+empire+in+persia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CaAhTNrBOoKKlwfRx4E2&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=roman%20empire%20in%20persia&amp;f=false|author1=Michael H.

The Sassanids ceded five provinces west of the Tigris, and agreed not to interfere in the affairs of Armenia and Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarinkoob|1999|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of this defeat, Narseh gave up the throne and died a year later, leaving the Sassanid throne to his son, [[Hormizd II]]. Unrest spread throughout the land, and while the new king suppressed revolts in [[Sakastan]] and Kushan, he was unable to control the nobles and was subsequently killed by [[Bedouins]] in a hunting trip in 309.

===First Golden Era (309–379)===
Following Hormizd II's death, northern Arabs started to ravage and plunder the western cities of the empire, even attacking the province of Fars, the birthplace of the Sassanid kings. Meanwhile, Persian nobles killed Hormizd II's eldest son, blinded the second, and imprisoned the third (who later escaped into Roman territory). The throne was reserved for [[Shapur II]], the unborn child of one of Hormizd II's wives who was crowned ''in utero'': the crown was placed upon his mother's stomach.&lt;ref&gt;Agathias, ''Histories'', 25, 2-5 translated by Dodgeon-Greatrex-Lieu (2002), I, 126&lt;/ref&gt; During his youth the empire was controlled by his mother and the nobles. Upon his coming of age, Shapur II assumed power and quickly proved to be an active and effective ruler.

He first led his small but disciplined army south against the Arabs, whom he defeated, securing the southern areas of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarinkoob|1999|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then began his first campaign against the Romans in the west, where Persian forces won a series of battles but were unable to make territorial gains due to the failure of repeated sieges of the key frontier city of Nisibis, and Roman success in retaking the cities of [[Singara]] and [[Diyarbakir|Amida]] after they had previously fallen to the Persians.

These campaigns were halted by nomadic raids along the eastern borders of the empire, which threatened [[Transoxiana]], a strategically critical area for control of the [[Silk Road]]. Shapur therefore marched east toward Transoxiana to meet the eastern nomads, leaving his local commanders to mount nuisance raids on the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blockley|1998|p=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; He crushed the Central Asian tribes, and annexed the area as a new province.

In the east around 325, [[Shapur II]] regained the upper hand against the [[Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom]] and took control of large territories in areas now known as [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. Cultural expansion followed this victory, and Sassanid art penetrated [[Turkestan]], reaching as far as China. Shapur, along with the nomad King [[Grumbates]], started his second campaign against the Romans in 359 and soon succeeded in retaking Singara and Amida. In response the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] struck deep into Persian territory and defeated Shapur's forces at [[Battle of Ctesiphon (363)|Ctesiphon]]. He failed to take the capital, however, and was killed while trying to retreat to Roman territory.&lt;ref name="Frye137-138"&gt;{{harvnb|Frye|1968|p=137&amp;nbsp;138}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]], trapped on the east bank of the Tigris, had to hand over all the provinces the Persians had ceded to Rome in 298, as well as Nisibis and Singara, to secure safe passage for his army out of Persia.

From around 370, however, towards the end of the reign of [[Shapur II]], the Sassanids lost the control of [[Bactria]] to invaders from the north: first the [[Kidarites]], then the [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalites]] and finally the [[Alchon Huns]], who would follow up with the invasion of [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Neelis |first1=Jason |title=Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks: Mobility and Exchange Within and Beyond the Northwestern Borderlands of South Asia |date=2010 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9004181598 |page=159 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GB-JV2eOr2UC&amp;pg=PA159 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These invaders initially issued coins based on [[Sasanian]] designs.&lt;ref name="Tandon2013"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Notes on the Evolution of Alchon Coins |journal=Journal of the Oriental Numismatic Society |year=2013 |last=Tandon |first=Pankaj |issue=216 |pages=24-34 |url=http://coinindia.com/Alchon.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2018-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various coins minted in [[Bactria]] and based on Sasanian designs are extant, often with busts imitating Sassanian kings Shapur II (r. 309 to 379) and [[Shapur III]] (r. 383 to 388), adding the Alchon [[Tamgha]] and the name "Alchono" in [[Bactrian script]] on the obverse, and with attendants to a [[fire altar]] on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cngcoins.com/Coin.aspx?CoinID=81794 CNG Coins]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rienjang |first1=Wannaporn |last2=Stewart |first2=Peter |title=Problems of Chronology in Gandhāran Art: Proceedings of the First International Workshop of the Gandhāra Connections Project, University of Oxford, 23rd-24th March, 2017 |date=2018 |publisher=Archaeopress |isbn=9781784918552 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I7dTDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shapur II pursued a harsh religious policy. Under his reign, the collection of the [[Avesta]], the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, was completed, heresy and apostasy were punished, and Christians were persecuted. The latter was a reaction against the [[Christianization]] of the Roman Empire by [[Constantine the Great]]. Shapur II, like Shapur I, was amicable towards [[Jews]], who lived in relative freedom and gained many advantages during his reign (''see also [[Rava (amora)|Raba]]''). At the time of his death, the Persian Empire was stronger than ever, with its enemies to the east pacified and [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] under Persian control.&lt;ref name="Frye137-138"/&gt;

===Intermediate Era (379–498)===
[[File:Folio from a Khamsa-c.jpg|thumb|[[Bahram V]] is a great favourite in [[Persian literature]] and poetry. "Bahram and the Indian princess in the black pavilion." Depiction of a Khamsa (Quintet) by the great Persian poet [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], mid-16th-century [[Safavid]] era.]]

From Shapur II's death until [[Kavadh I]]'s first coronation, there was a largely peaceful period with the Romans (by this time the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] or [[Byzantine Empire]]) engaged in just two brief wars with the Sassanian Empire, the [[Roman–Sasanian War (421–422)|first in 421–422]] and the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 440|second in 440]].&lt;ref name="Neusner68"&gt;{{harvnb|Neusner|1969|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bury|1923|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/14*.html |title=XIV.1 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frye|1993|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 37–51&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this era, Sassanid religious policy differed dramatically from king to king. Despite a series of weak leaders, the administrative system established during Shapur II's reign remained strong, and the empire continued to function effectively.&lt;ref name="Neusner68"/&gt;

After Shapur II died in 379, the empire passed on to his half-brother [[Ardashir II]] (379–383; son of Hormizd II) and his son [[Shapur III]] (383–388), neither of whom demonstrated their predecessor's skill in ruling. Ardashir, who was raised as the "half-brother" of the emperor, failed to fill his brother's shoes, and Shapur was too much of a melancholy character to achieve anything. [[Bahram IV of Persia|Bahram IV]] (388–399), although not as inactive as his father, still failed to achieve anything important for the empire. During this time Armenia was divided by a treaty between the Roman and Sassanid empires. The Sassanids reestablished their rule over Greater Armenia, while the Byzantine Empire held a small portion of western Armenia.

Bahram IV's son [[Yazdegerd I]] (399–421) is often compared to [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]]. Both were physically and diplomatically powerful, opportunistic, practiced religious tolerance and provided freedom for the rise of religious minorities. Yazdegerd stopped the persecution against the Christians and punished nobles and priests who persecuted them. His reign marked a relatively peaceful era with the Romans, and he even took the young [[Theodosius II]] (408–450) under his guardianship. Yazdegerd also married a Jewish princess, who bore him a son called Narsi.

Yazdegerd I's successor was his son [[Bahram V]] (421–438), one of the most well-known Sassanid kings and the hero of many myths. These myths persisted even after the destruction of the Sassanid empire by the Arabs. Bahram gained the crown after Yazdegerd's sudden death (or assassination), which occurred when the grandees opposed the king with the help of [[al-Mundhir I ibn al-Nu'man|al-Mundhir]], the Arabic dynast of [[al-Hirah]]. Bahram's mother was [[Shushandukht]], the daughter of the Jewish [[Exilarch]]. In 427, he crushed an invasion in the east by the nomadic [[Hephthalites]], extending his influence into Central Asia, where his portrait survived for centuries on the coinage of [[Bukhara]] (in modern [[Uzbekistan]]). Bahram deposed the vassal king of the Persian-held area of [[Armenia]] and made it a province of the empire.

[[File:HormizdI.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of [[Hormizd I Kushanshah]], issued in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], and derived from [[Kushan]] designs.]]

There are many stories that tell of Bahram V's valour, his beauty, and his victories over the Romans, [[Turkic peoples]], Indians and [[Africans]], as well as his exploits in hunting and his pursuits of love. He was better known as Bahram-e Gur, ''Gur'' meaning [[onager]], on account of his love for hunting and, in particular, hunting onagers. He symbolised a king at the height of a golden age, embodying royal prosperity. He had won his crown by competing with his brother and spent much time fighting foreign enemies, but mostly he kept himself amused by hunting, holding court parties and entertaining a famous band of ladies and courtiers. During his time, the best pieces of [[Pahlavi literature|Sassanid literature]] were written, notable pieces of [[Sassanid music]] were composed, and sports such as [[polo]] became royal pastimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranologie.com/history/history5.html |title=History of Iran, Chapter V:Sassanians |accessdate=2009-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715080555/http://www.iranologie.com/history/history5.html |archivedate=15 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahram V's son [[Yazdegerd II]] (438–457) was in some ways a moderate ruler, but, in contrast to Yazdegerd I, he practised a harsh policy towards minority religions, particularly [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarinkoob|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the [[Battle of Avarayr]] in 451, the [[Persian Armenia|Armenian subjects]] led by [[Vardan Mamikonian]] reaffirmed Armenia's right to profess Christianity freely.&lt;ref name="Hewsen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hewsen|first1=Robert H.|authorlink1=Robert H.

Though the Armenians lost their commander, Vartan Mamikonian, and most of their soldiers, Persian losses were proportionately heavy, and Armenia was allowed to remain Christian.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was to be later confirmed by the [[Nvarsak Treaty]] (484).

At the beginning of his reign in 441, Yazdegerd II assembled an army of soldiers from various nations, including his Indian allies, and attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]], but peace was soon restored after some small-scale fighting. He then gathered his forces in [[Nishapur]] in 443 and launched a prolonged campaign against the [[Kidarites]]. After a number of battles he crushed them and drove them out beyond the [[Oxus|Oxus river]] in 450.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarinkoob|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his eastern campaign, Yazdegerd II grew suspicious of the Christians in the army and expelled them all from the governing body and army. He then persecuted the Christians in his land, and, to a much lesser extent, the [[Jew]]s.&lt;ref name="Zarinkoob219"&gt;{{harvnb|Zarinkoob|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reestablish Zoroastrianism in Armenia, he crushed an uprising of Armenian Christians at the [[Battle of Vartanantz]] in 451. The Armenians, however, remained primarily Christian. In his later years, he was engaged yet again with the Kidarites right up until his death in 457. [[Hormizd III]] (457–459), the younger son of Yazdegerd II, then ascended to the throne. During his short rule, he continually fought with his elder brother [[Peroz I of Persia|Peroz I]], who had the support of the nobility,&lt;ref name="Zarinkoob219"/&gt; and with the Hephthalites in [[Bactria]]. He was killed by his brother Peroz in 459.

[[File:YazdegerdIICoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|A coin of [[Yazdegerd II]]]]

At the beginning of the 5th century, the Hephthalites (White Huns), along with other nomadic groups, attacked Persia. At first Bahram V and Yazdegerd II inflicted decisive defeats against them and drove them back eastward. The Huns returned at the end of the 5th century and defeated Peroz I (457–484) in 483. Following this victory, the Huns invaded and plundered parts of eastern Persia continually for two years. They exacted heavy tribute for some years thereafter.

These attacks brought instability and chaos to the kingdom. Peroz tried again to drive out the Hephthalites, but on the way to [[Herat]] his army was trapped by the Huns in the desert. Peroz was killed and his army was wiped out. After this victory, the Hephthalites advanced forward to the city of Herat, throwing the empire into chaos. Eventually a noble Iranian named Karen from the old family of [[Sukhra]] restored some degree of order. He put [[Balash]], one of Peroz I's brothers, on the throne. The Hunnic threat persisted until the reign of [[Khosrau I of Persia|Khosrau I]]. Balash (484–488) was a mild and generous monarch, who made concessions to the Christians; however, he took no action against the empire's enemies, particularly the White Huns. After a reign of four years, he was blinded and deposed (attributed to magnates), and his nephew [[Kavadh I]] acceded to the throne.

Kavadh I (488–531) was an energetic and reformist ruler. He gave his support to the sect founded by [[Mazdak]], son of Bamdad, who demanded that the rich should divide their wives and their wealth with the poor. By adopting the doctrine of the Mazdakites, his intention evidently was to break the influence of the magnates and the growing aristocracy. These reforms led to his being deposed and imprisoned in the "Castle of Oblivion" in [[Susa]], and his younger brother [[Djamasp of Persia|Jamasp]] (Zamaspes) became king in 496. Kavadh, however, escaped in 498 and was given refuge by the White Hun king.

[[Djamasp of Persia|Djamasp]] (496–498) was installed on the Sassanid throne upon the deposition of Kavadh I by members of the nobility. He was a good and kind king; he reduced taxes in order to improve the condition of the [[peasant]]s and the poor. He was also an adherent of the mainstream Zoroastrian religion, diversions from which had cost Kavadh I his throne and freedom. Djamasp's reign soon ended, however, when Kavadh I, at the head of a large army granted to him by the Hephthalite king, returned to the empire's capital. Djamasp stepped down from his position and returned the throne to his brother. No further mention of Djamasp is made after the restoration of Kavadh I, but it is widely believed that he was treated favourably at the court of his brother.&lt;ref name="iranologie"&gt;{{cite web|author=Khodadad Rezakhani |url=http://www.iranologie.com/history/history5.html |title=Iranologie History of Iran Chapter V: Sasanians |publisher=Iranologie.com |accessdate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206060011/http://www.iranologie.com/history/history5.html |archivedate=6 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Golden Era (498–622)===
The second golden era began after the second reign of Kavadh I. With the support of the [[Hephtalites]], Kavadh launched a campaign against the Romans. In 502, he took [[Theodosiopolis (Armenia)|Theodosiopolis]] in Armenia, but lost it soon afterwards. In 503 he took [[Amida (Roman city)|Amida]] on the Tigris. In 504, an invasion of Armenia by the western Huns from the Caucasus led to an armistice, the return of Amida to Roman control and a peace treaty in 506. In 521/522 Kavadh lost control of [[Lazica]], whose rulers switched their allegiance to the Romans; an attempt by the [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberians]] in 524/525 to do likewise triggered a war between Rome and Persia.

In 527, a Roman offensive against Nisibis was repulsed and Roman efforts to fortify positions near the frontier were thwarted. In 530, Kavadh sent an army under [[Perozes]] to attack the important Roman frontier city of [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]]. The army was met by the Roman general [[Belisarius]], and, though superior in numbers, was defeated at the [[Battle of Daras|Battle of Dara]]. In the same year, a second Persian army under [[Mihr-Mihroe]] was defeated at [[Satala]] by Roman forces under [[Sittas]] and Dorotheus, but in 531 a Persian army accompanied by a [[Lakhmids|Lakhmid]] contingent under [[Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man|Al-Mundhir III]] defeated Belisarius at the [[Battle of Callinicum]], and in 532 an "eternal" peace was concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Zarinkoob, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he could not free himself from the yoke of the Hephthalites, Kavadh succeeded in restoring order in the interior and fought with general success against the Eastern Romans, founded several cities, some of which were named after him, and began to regulate taxation and internal administration.

[[File:ChosroesHuntingScene.JPG|thumb|Hunting scene on a [[gilded silver]] bowl showing king [[Khosrau I]]]]

After the reign of Kavadh I, his son [[Khosrau I]], also known as Anushirvan ("with the immortal soul"; ruled 531–579), ascended to the throne. He is the most celebrated of the Sassanid rulers. Khosrau I is most famous for his reforms in the aging governing body of Sassanids. He introduced a rational system of [[taxation]] based upon a survey of [[landed possession]]s, which his father had begun, and he tried in every way to increase the welfare and the revenues of his empire. Previous great feudal lords fielded their own military equipment, followers, and retainers. Khosrau I developed a new force of [[dehqan]]s, or "knights", paid and equipped by the central government&lt;ref name="Frye"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/fryehst.html |title=Richard Frye "The History of Ancient Iran" |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the bureaucracy, tying the army and bureaucracy more closely to the central government than to local lords.&lt;ref&gt;For more on the reforms of Khosrau I, visit http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/reforms_of_anushirvan.php.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor [[Justinian I]] (527–565) paid Khosrau I 440,000 pieces of gold as a part of the "eternal peace" treaty of 532. In 540, Khosrau broke the treaty and invaded Syria, sacking Antioch and extorting large sums of money from a number of other cities. Further successes followed: in 541 Lazica defected to the Persian side, and in 542 a major Byzantine offensive in [[Armenia]] was defeated at Anglon. Also in 541, [[Khosrau I]] entered Lazica at the invitation of its king, captured the main Byzantine stronghold at [[Petra, Lazica|Petra]], and established another protectorate over the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|pp=559, 639}}; {{harvnb|Bury|1958|pp=101–102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; commencing the [[Lazic War]]. A five-year truce agreed to in 545 was interrupted in 547 when Lazica again switched sides and eventually expelled its Persian garrison with Byzantine help; the war resumed but remained confined to Lazica, which was retained by the Byzantines when peace was concluded in 562.

In 565, Justinian I died and was succeeded by [[Justin II]] (565–578), who resolved to stop subsidies to Arab chieftains to restrain them from raiding Byzantine territory in Syria. A year earlier, the Sassanid governor of Armenia, [[Chihor-Vishnasp]] of the Suren family, built a fire temple at [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] near modern [[Yerevan]], and he put to death an influential member of the [[Mamikonian]] family, touching off a revolt which led to the massacre of the Persian governor and his guard in 571, while rebellion also broke out in [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]]. Justin II took advantage of the Armenian revolt to stop his yearly payments to Khosrau I for the defense of the Caucasus passes.

The Armenians were welcomed as allies, and an army was sent into Sassanid territory which [[Siege of Nisibis (573)|besieged]] Nisibis in 573. However, dissension among the Byzantine generals not only led to an abandonment of the siege, but they in turn were besieged in the city of [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]], which was taken by the Persians.  Capitalizing on this success, the Persians then ravaged Syria, causing Justin II to agree to make annual payments in exchange for a five-year truce on the Mesopotamian front, although the war continued elsewhere. In 576 Khosrau I led his last campaign, an offensive into Anatolia which sacked [[Sivas|Sebasteia]] and [[Malatya|Melitene]], but ended in disaster: defeated outside Melitene, the Persians suffered heavy losses as they fled across the Euphrates under Byzantine attack. Taking advantage of Persian disarray, the Byzantines raided deep into Khosrau's territory, even mounting amphibious attacks across the [[Caspian Sea]]. Khosrau sued for peace, but he decided to continue the war after a victory by his general [[Tamkhosrau]] in Armenia in 577, and fighting resumed in Mesopotamia. The Armenian revolt came to an end with a general amnesty, which brought Armenia back into the Sassanid Empire.&lt;ref name="Frye" /&gt;

Around 570, "Ma 'd-Karib", half-brother of the King of Yemen, requested Khosrau I's intervention. Khosrau I sent a fleet and a small army under a commander called [[Vahriz]] to the area near present [[Aden]], and they marched against the capital San'a'l, which was occupied. Saif, son of Mard-Karib, who had accompanied the expedition, became King sometime between 575 and 577. Thus, the Sassanids were able to establish a base in [[South Arabia]] to control the sea trade with the east. Later, the south Arabian kingdom renounced Sassanid overlordship, and another Persian expedition was sent in 598 that successfully annexed southern Arabia as a Sassanid province, which lasted until the time of troubles after Khosrau II.&lt;ref name="Frye" /&gt;

Khosrau I's reign witnessed the rise of the dihqans (literally, village lords), the petty landholding nobility who were the backbone of later Sassanid provincial administration and the tax collection system.&lt;ref name="Chamber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/historic_periods.php |title=Iran Chamber Society: The Sassanid Empire, 224–642 AD |publisher=Iranchamber.com |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khosrau I was a great builder, embellishing his capital and founding new towns with the construction of new buildings. He rebuilt the canals and restocked the farms destroyed in the wars. He built strong fortifications at the passes and placed subject tribes in carefully chosen towns on the frontiers to act as guardians against invaders. He was tolerant of all religions, though he decreed that [[Zoroastrianism]] should be the official state religion, and was not unduly disturbed when one of his sons became a Christian.

After Khosrau I, [[Hormizd IV]] (579–590) took the throne. The war with the Byzantines continued to rage intensely but inconclusively until the general [[Bahram Chobin]], dismissed and humiliated by Hormizd, rose in revolt in 589. The following year, Hormizd was overthrown by a palace coup and his son [[Khosrau II]] (590–628) placed on the throne. However, this change of ruler failed to placate Bahram, who defeated Khosrau, forcing him to flee to Byzantine territory, and seized the throne for himself as Bahram VI. Khosrau asked the Byzantine Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (582–602) for assistance against Bahram, offering to cede the western Caucasus to the Byzantines. To cement the alliance, Khosrau also married Maurice's daughter Miriam. Under the command of Khosrau and the Byzantine generals [[Narses (general under Maurice)|Narses]] and [[John Mystacon]], the new combined Byzantine-Persian army raised a rebellion against Bahram, defeating him at the [[Battle of Blarathon]] in 591. When Khosrau was subsequently restored to power he kept his promise, handing over control of western [[Armenia]] and [[Caucasian Iberia]]. 

[[File:Hephthalites. Anonymous. Before AD 700. Imitating Khosrau II.jpg|thumb|A [[Hephthalite]] coin imitating the coinage of [[Khosrow II]].

The new peace arrangement allowed the two empires to focus on military matters elsewhere: Khosrau focused on the Sassanid Empire's eastern frontier while Maurice restored Byzantine control of the [[Balkans]]. Circa 600, the [[Hephthalites]] had been raiding the Sassanid Empire as far as [[Spahan (satrapy)|Spahan]] in central Iran. The Hephthalites issued numerous coins imitating the coinage of Khosrow II. In c. 606/607, Khosrow recalled [[Smbat IV Bagratuni]] from [[Persian Armenia]] and sent him to Iran to repel the Hephthalites. Smbat, with the aid of a Persian prince named Datoyean, repelled the Hephthalites from Persia, and plundered their domains in [[Greater Khorasan|eastern Khorasan]], where Smbat is said to have killed their king in single combat.&lt;ref name="PLRE"&gt;Martindale, Jones &amp; Morris (1992), pp. 1363–1364&lt;/ref&gt;

After Maurice was overthrown and killed by [[Phocas]] (602–610) in 602, however, Khosrau II used the murder of his benefactor as a pretext to begin a new invasion, which benefited from continuing civil war in the Byzantine Empire and met little effective resistance. Khosrau's generals systematically subdued the heavily fortified frontier cities of Byzantine Mesopotamia and Armenia, laying the foundations for unprecedented expansion. The Persians overran [[Syria]] and captured Antioch in 611.

In 613, outside Antioch, the Persian generals [[Shahrbaraz]] and [[Shahin Vahmanzadegan|Shahin]] decisively defeated a major counter-attack led in person by the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]]. Thereafter, the Persian advance continued unchecked. [[Jerusalem]] fell in 614, [[Alexandria]] in 619, and the rest of [[Egypt]] by 621. The Sassanid dream of restoring the [[Achaemenid]] boundaries was almost complete, while the [[Byzantine Empire]] was on the verge of collapse. This remarkable peak of expansion was paralleled by a blossoming of [[Iranian art|Persian art]], [[Music of Iran|music]], and [[Iranian architecture|architecture]].

===Decline and fall (622–651)===
{{Main article|Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628|Sasanian civil war of 628-632|Fall of the Sasanian Empire|Muslim conquest of Persia}}

While successful at its first stage (from 602 to 622), the campaign of [[Khosrau II]] had actually exhausted the Persian army and treasuries. In an effort to rebuild the national treasuries, Khosrau overtaxed the population. Thus, while his empire was on the verge of total defeat, [[Heraclius]] (610–641) drew on all his diminished and devastated empire's remaining resources, reorganised his armies, and mounted a remarkable, risky counter-offensive. Between 622 and 627, he campaigned against the Persians in Anatolia and the Caucasus, winning a string of victories against Persian forces under [[Shahrbaraz]], [[Shahin Vahmanzadegan|Shahin]], and [[Shahraplakan]] (whose competition to claim the glory of personally defeating the Byzantine emperor contributed to their failure), sacking the great Zoroastrian temple at [[Takht-e Soleymān|Ganzak]], and securing [[Third Perso-Turkic War|assistance]] from the [[Khazars]] and [[Western Turkic Khaganate]].

[[File:Moldovita murals 2010 16.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|Siege of Constantinople in 626]] by the combined Sassanid, Avar, and Slavic forces depicted on the [[murals]] of the [[Moldovița Monastery]], [[Romania]]]]

In response, Khosrau, in coordination with [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] forces, [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|launched a siege]] on the Byzantine capital of [[Constantinople]] in 626. The Sassanids, led by Shahrbaraz, attacked the city on the eastern side of the [[Bosphorus]], while his Avar and Slavic allies invaded from the western side. Attempts to ferry the Persian forces across the Bosphorus to aid their allies (the Slavic forces being by far the most capable in siege warfare) were blocked by the [[Byzantine navy|Byzantine fleet]], and the siege ended in failure. In 627–628, Heraclius mounted a winter invasion of Mesopotamia, and, despite the departure of his Khazar allies, defeated a Persian army commanded by [[Rhahzadh]] in the [[Battle of Nineveh (627)|Battle of Nineveh]]. He then marched down the Tigris, devastating the country and sacking Khosrau's palace at [[Dastagird|Dastagerd]]. He was prevented from attacking Ctesiphon by the destruction of the bridges on the [[Nahrawan Canal]] and conducted further raids before withdrawing up the [[Diyala River|Diyala]] into north-western Iran.&lt;ref name="HBS"&gt;Haldon (1997), 46; Baynes (1912), ''passim''; Speck (1984), 178&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of Heraclius's victories, the devastation of the richest territories of the Sassanid Empire, and the humiliating destruction of high-profile targets such as Ganzak and Dastagerd fatally undermined Khosrau's prestige and his support among the Persian aristocracy. In early 628, he was overthrown and murdered by his son [[Kavadh II]] (628), who immediately brought an end to the war, agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territories. In 629, Heraclius restored the [[True Cross]] to [[Jerusalem]] in a majestic ceremony.&lt;ref name="HBS" /&gt; Kavadh died within months, and chaos and [[Sasanian civil war of 628-632|civil war]] followed. Over a period of four years and five successive kings, the Sassanid Empire weakened considerably. The power of the central authority passed into the hands of the generals. It would take several years for a strong king to emerge from a series of coups, and the Sassanids never had time to recover fully.&lt;ref name="Chamber" /&gt;

[[File:SassanidEmpirebeforeArabConquest.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Extent of the Sasanian Empire in 632]]
In early 632, a grandson of Khosrau I, who had lived in hiding in [[Estakhr]], [[Yazdegerd III]], acceded to the throne. The same year, the first raiders from the [[Arab]] tribes, newly united by [[Islam]], arrived in Persian territory. According to Howard-Johnston, years of warfare had exhausted both the Byzantines and the Persians. The Sassanids were further weakened by economic decline, heavy taxation, religious unrest, rigid social stratification, the increasing power of the provincial landholders, and a rapid turnover of rulers, facilitating the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]].&lt;ref name = HJ291&gt;{{Harvnb|Howard-Johnston|2006|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sassanids never mounted a truly effective resistance to the pressure applied by the initial Arab armies. Yazdegerd was a boy at the mercy of his advisers and incapable of uniting a vast country crumbling into small feudal kingdoms, despite the fact that the Byzantines, under similar pressure from the newly expansive Arabs, were no longer a threat. Caliph [[Abu Bakr]]'s commander [[Khalid ibn Walid]], once one of [[Muhammad]]'s chosen companions-in-arms and leader of the Arab army, moved to capture [[Iraq]] in a series of lightning battles. Redeployed to the Syrian front against the Byzantines in June 634, Khalid's successor in Iraq failed him, and the Muslims were defeated in the [[Battle of the Bridge]] in 634. However, the Arab threat did not stop there and reemerged shortly via the disciplined armies of Khalid ibn Walid.

In 637, a Muslim army under the Caliph [[Umar|Umar ibn al-Khattāb]] defeated a larger Persian force led by General [[Rostam Farrokhzad]] at the plains of [[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah|al-Qādisiyyah]], and then advanced on Ctesiphon, which fell after a prolonged siege. Yazdegerd fled eastward from Ctesiphon, leaving behind him most of the empire's vast treasury. The [[Siege of Ctesiphon (637)|Arabs captured Ctesiphon]] shortly afterward. Thus the Muslims were able to seize a powerful financial resource, leaving the Sassanid government strapped for funds. A number of Sassanid governors attempted to combine their forces to throw back the invaders, but the effort was crippled by the lack of a strong central authority, and the governors were defeated at the [[Battle of Nihawānd]]. The empire, with its military command structure non-existent, its non-noble troop levies decimated, its financial resources effectively destroyed, and the [[Sassanid army#Azadan nobility|Asawaran (Azatan)]] knightly caste destroyed piecemeal, was now utterly helpless in the face of the Arab invaders.

Upon hearing of the defeat in Nihawānd, Yazdegerd along with [[Farrukhzad]] and some of the Persian nobles fled further inland to the eastern province of [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]]. Yazdegerd was assassinated by a miller in [[Merv]] in late 651, while some of the nobles settled in [[Central Asia]], where they contributed greatly to spreading the Persian culture and language in those regions and to the establishment of the first native Iranian Islamic dynasty, the [[Samanid dynasty]], which sought to revive Sassanid traditions.

The abrupt fall of the Sassanid Empire was completed in a period of just five years, and most of its territory was absorbed into the Islamic [[caliphate]]; however, many Iranian cities resisted and fought against the invaders several times. Islamic caliphates repeatedly suppressed revolts in cities such as [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], and [[Hamadan]].&lt;ref&gt;Zarinkoob, pp. 305–317&lt;/ref&gt; The local population was initially under little pressure to convert to Islam, remaining as [[dhimmi]] subjects of the Muslim state and paying a [[jizya]].&lt;ref&gt;Bashear, Suliman, ''Arabs and others in Early Islam'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The jizya practically replaced the poll taxes imposed by the Sassanids. In addition, the old Sassanid "land tax" (known in Arabic as ''Kharaj'') was also adopted. Caliph Umar is said to have occasionally set up a commission to survey the taxes, to judge if they were more than the land could bear.&lt;ref&gt;''The Caliphs and Their Non-Muslim Subjects''. A. S. Tritton, pg.139.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion of the Persian population to Islam would take place gradually, particularly as Persian-speaking elites attempted to gain positions of prestige much later under the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].

===Descendants===
It is believed that the following dynasties and noble-families have ancestors among the Sassanian rulers:
* The [[Dabuyid dynasty]] (642–760) descendant of [[Djamasp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dabuyids-the-dynasty-of-espahbads-ruling-tabarestan-until-its-conquest-by-the-muslims-in-144-761 |title=DABUYIDS |work=Encyclopaedia Iranica |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Paduspanids]] (665–1598) of [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]], descendant of [[Djamasp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baduspanids |title=BADUSPANIDS |work=Encyclopaedia Iranica |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Shahs of Shirwan]] (1100–1382) from [[Hormizd IV]]'s line.&lt;ref&gt;Stokvis A.M.H.J., pp. 112, 129.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Banu Munajjim]] (9th–10th century) from Mihr Gushnasp, an Sasanian prince.
* The [[Ahmad ibn Sahl|Kamkarian family]] (9th–10th century) a ''[[dehqan]]'' family descended from [[Yazdegerd III]].
* The [[Mikalids]] (9th–11th century) a family descended from the Sogdian ruler [[Divashtich]], who was in turn a descendant of [[Bahram V|Bahram V Gur]].

==Government==
The Sassanids established an empire roughly within the frontiers achieved by the Parthian Arsacids, with the capital at Ctesiphon in the [[Asoristan]] province. In administering this empire, Sassanid rulers took the title of ''shahanshah'' (King of Kings), becoming the central overlords and also assumed guardianship of the [[atar|sacred fire]], the symbol of the national religion. This symbol is explicit on Sassanid coins where the reigning monarch, with his crown and regalia of office, appears on the obverse, backed by the sacred fire, the symbol of the national religion, on the coin's reverse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecai.org/sasanianweb/] Guitty Azarpay ''"The Near East in Late Antiquity The Sasanian Empire"''&lt;/ref&gt; Sassanid queens had the title of [[Banbishnan banbishn]] (Queen of Queens).

On a smaller scale, the territory might also be ruled by a number of petty rulers from a noble family, known as ''[[shahrdar]]'', overseen directly by the ''shahanshah''. The districts of the provinces were ruled by a ''[[Shahrab (office)|shahrab]]'' and a ''[[Mobad|mowbed]]'' (chief priest). The mowbed's job was to deal with estates and other things relating to legal matters. {{sfn|Daryaee|2008|p=125}} Sasanian rule was characterized by considerable centralization, ambitious urban planning, agricultural development, and technological improvements.&lt;ref name="Chamber" /&gt; Below the king, a powerful bureaucracy carried out much of the affairs of government; the head of the bureaucracy was the ''[[wuzurg framadar]]'' ([[vizier]] or [[prime minister]]). Within this bureaucracy the Zoroastrian priesthood was immensely powerful. The head of the Magi priestly class, the ''[[mowbedan mowbed]]'', along with the commander-in-chief, the ''[[spahbed]]'', the head of traders and merchants syndicate ''Ho Tokhshan Bod'' and minister of agriculture (''[[wastaryoshan-salar]]''), who was also head of farmers, were, below the emperor, the most powerful men of the Sassanid state.&lt;ref&gt;Sarfaraz, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sassanian rulers always considered the advice of their ministers. A Muslim historian, [[Masudi]], praised the "excellent administration of the Sasanian kings, their well-ordered policy, their care for their subjects, and the prosperity of their domains". In normal times, the monarchical office was hereditary, but might be transferred by the king to a younger son; in two instances the supreme power was held by queens. When no direct heir was available, the nobles and prelates chose a ruler, but their choice was restricted to members of the royal family.&lt;ref name="Durant"/&gt;

The Sasanian nobility was a mixture of old Parthian clans, Persian aristocratic families, and noble families from subjected territories. Many new noble families had risen after the dissolution of the Parthian dynasty, while several of the once-dominant [[Seven Parthian clans]] remained of high importance. At the court of Ardashir I, the old Arsacid families of the [[House of Karen]] and the [[House of Suren]], along with several other families, the Varazes and Andigans, held positions of great honor. Alongside these Iranian and non-Iranian noble families, the kings of [[Merv]], [[Abarshahr]], [[Kirman (Sasanian province)|Kirman]], Sakastan, [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]], and [[Adiabene]], who are mentioned as holding positions of honor amongst the nobles, appeared at the court of the ''shahanshah''. Indeed, the extensive domains of the Surens, Karens and Varazes, had become part of the original Sassanid state as semi-independent states. Thus, the noble families that attended at the court of the Sassanid empire continued to be ruling lines in their own right, although subordinate to the ''shahanshah''.

In general, ''[[Wuzurgan]]'' from Iranian families held the most powerful positions in the imperial administration, including governorships of border provinces (''[[marzban]]''). Most of these positions were patrimonial, and many were passed down through a single family for generations. The ''marzbans'' of greatest seniority were permitted a silver throne, while ''marzbans'' of the most strategic border provinces, such as the [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasus]] province, were allowed a golden throne.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolle, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In military campaigns, the regional ''marzbans'' could be regarded as field marshals, while lesser ''[[spahbed]]s'' could command a field army.&lt;ref name="Nicolle, p. 14"&gt;Nicolle, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally, the Sassanids implemented a system of social stratification. This system was supported by Zoroastrianism, which was established as the state religion. Other religions appear to have been largely tolerated, although this claim has been debated.&lt;ref&gt;Wiesehöfer, ''Ancient Persia'', or the ''Cambridge History of Iran'', vol. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Sassanid emperors consciously sought to resuscitate [[Persian Empire|Persian]] traditions and to obliterate Greek cultural influence.&lt;ref name="Chamber" /&gt;

===Sasanian military===
{{Main article|Military of the Sasanian Empire}}
[[File:Крепость Нарын-Кала в Дербенте.jpg|thumb|The Walls of [[Derbent]], part of the [[Sasanian defence lines]]]]
[[File:Sassanid army helmet by Nickmard Khoey.jpg|thumb|[[Military of the Sasanian Empire|Sasanian army]] helmet]]
The active army of the Sassanid Empire originated from [[Ardashir I]], the first ''shahanshah'' of the empire. Ardashir restored the Achaemenid military organizations, retained the [[Cataphract|Parthian cavalry]] model, and employed new types of armour and siege warfare techniques.

====Role of priests====
The relationship between priests and warriors was important, because the concept of Ērānshahr had been revived by the priests. Without this relationship, the Sassanid Empire would not have survived in its beginning stages. Because of this relationship between the warriors and the priests, religion and state were considered inseparable in the Zoroastrian religion. However, it is this same relationship that caused the weakening of the Empire, when each group tried to impose their power onto the other. Disagreements between the priests and the warriors led to fragmentation within the empire, which led to its downfall.&lt;ref name="Daryaee, Touraj"&gt;{{cite book|last=Daryaee|first=Touraj|title=Sasanian Persia: The Rise and Fall of an Empire|year=2009|publisher=I.B. Tauris &amp; Co Ltd|location=New York NY|pages=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Infantry====
The [[Paygan]] formed the bulk of the Sassanid infantry, and were often recruited from the peasant population. Each unit was headed by an officer called a "[[Paygan-salar]]," which meant "commander of the infantry" and their main task was to guard the baggage train, serve as pages to the [[Asvaran]] (a higher rank), storm fortification walls, undertake entrenchment projects, and excavate mines.&lt;ref name=source&gt;{{cite book|title=Sassanian elite cavalry AD 224-642|author1=Kaveh Farrokh |author2=Angus McBride |publisher=Osprey Publishing|date=July 13, 2005|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQspOf291_cC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=paighan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ioIiT_ydEsrl0QGH2szaCA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=paighan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those serving in the infantry were fitted with shields and lances. To make the size of their army larger, the Sassanids added soldiers provided by the [[Media (region)|Medes]] and the [[Dailamites]] to their own. The Medes provided the Sassanid army with high-quality javelin throwers, slingers and heavy infantry. Iranian infantry are described by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] as "armed like gladiators" and "obey orders like so many horse-boys".&lt;ref&gt;Vadim Mikhaĭlovich Masson, ''History of Civilizations of Central Asia'', Vol.II, (UNESCO, 1996), 52.[https://books.google.com/books?id=883OZBe2sMYC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Ammianus+Marcellinus+Persian+infantry+disciplined&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0Ct1TuaAHM_fsQK30c2LBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ammianus%20Marcellinus%20Persian%20infantry%20disciplined&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The Dailamite people also served as infantry and were Iranian people who lived mainly within Gilan, Iranian Azerbaijan and Mazandaran. They are reported as having fought with weapons such as daggers, swords and javelins and reputed to have been recognized by Romans for their skills and hardiness in close-quarter combat. One account of Dailamites recounted their participation in an invasion of Yemen where 800 of them were led by the Dailamite officer [[Vahriz]].&lt;ref name=source/&gt; Vahriz would eventually defeat the Arab forces in Yemen and its capital [[Sana'a]] making it a Sasanian vassal until the invasion of Persia by Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shadows in the desert: ancient Persia at war|author=Kaveh Farrokh|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2007|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p7kltwf9yrwC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=Vahriz+defeat+Yemen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AYkiT4aZCcTm0QHC58GwCA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Vahriz%20defeat%20Yemen&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Navy====
The [[Sasanian navy]] was an important constituent of the Sasanian military from the time that Ardashir I conquered the Arab side of the [[Persian Gulf]]. Because controlling the Persian Gulf was an economic necessity, the Sasanian navy worked to keep it safe from piracy, prevent Roman encroachment, and keep the Arab tribes from getting hostile. However, it is believed by many historians that the naval force could not have been a strong one, as the men serving in the navy were those who were confined in prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Daryaee|first=Touraj|title=Sasanian Persia: The Rise and Fall of an Empire|year=2009|publisher=I.B.

====Cavalry====
[[File:Knight-Iran.JPG|thumb|A Sassanid king posing as an armored cavalryman, [[Taq-e Bostan]], Iran]]

The cavalry used during the Sassanid Empire were two types of heavy cavalry units: [[Clibanarii]] and [[Cataphract]]s. The first cavalry force, composed of elite noblemen trained since youth for military service, was supported by light cavalry, infantry and archers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Why Europe?: The Medieval Origins of Its Special Path|author1=Michael Mitterauer |author2=Gerald Chapple |publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=July 15, 2010|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IU9fduDRIMC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=sassanid+cavalry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K4siT6WoIufq0gHylrGHCQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sassanid%20cavalry&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercenaries and tribal people of the empire, including the Turks, Kushans, Sarmatians, Khazars, Georgians, and Armenians were included in these first cavalry units. The second cavalry involved the use of the [[Persian war elephants|war elephants]]. In fact, it was their specialty to deploy elephants as cavalry support.

Unlike the Parthians, the Sassanids developed advanced [[siege engines]]. The development of siege weapons was a useful weapon during conflicts with Rome, in which success hinged upon the ability to seize cities and other fortified points; conversely, the Sassanids also developed a number of techniques for defending their own cities from attack. The Sassanid army was much like the preceding Parthian army, although some of the Sassanid's heavy cavalry were equipped with lances, while Parthian armies were heavily equipped with bows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yarshater|first=Ehsan|title=The Cambridge History of Iran Volume 3 (1): The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian Periods|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=Chapter 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]]'s description of Shapur II's clibanarii cavalry manifestly shows how heavily equipped it was, and how only a portion were spear equipped:

{{Cquote|''All the companies were clad in iron, and all parts of their bodies were covered with thick plates, so fitted that the stiff-joints conformed with those of their limbs; and the forms of human faces were so skillfully fitted to their heads, that since their entire body was covered with metal, arrows that fell upon them could lodge only where they could see a little through tiny openings opposite the pupil of the eye, or where through the tip of their nose they were able to get a little breath. Of these, some who were armed with pikes, stood so motionless that you would have thought them held fast by clamps of bronze.''}}

Horsemen in the Sassanid cavalry lacked a stirrup. Instead, they used a war saddle which had a cantle at the back and two guard clamps which curved across the top of the rider's thighs. This allowed the horsemen to stay in the saddle at all times during the battle, especially during violent encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shahbazi|first=A. Sh.|title=History of Iran: Sassanian Army|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/sassanids/sassanian_army.php|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Byzantine emperor Maurikios also emphasizes [[Strategikon of Maurice|in his ''Strategikon'']] that many of the Sassanid heavy cavalry did not carry spears, relying on their bows as their primary weapons. However the Taq-i Bustan reliefs and Al-Tabari's famed list of equipment required for dihqan knights which included the lance, provide a contrast. What is certain is that the horseman's paraphernalia was extensive.

The amount of money involved in maintaining a warrior of the [[Sassanid army#Azadan nobility|Asawaran (Azatan)]] knightly caste required a small estate, and the Asawaran (Azatan) knightly caste received that from the throne, and in return, were the throne's most notable defenders in time of war.

The Sassanids, like the Parthians, were in constant hostilities with the [[Roman Empire]]. The Sassanids, who succeeded the Parthians, were recognized as one of the leading world powers alongside its neighboring rival the Byzantine Empire, or Eastern Roman Empire, for a period of more than 400 years.&lt;ref name="EIr-Sasanian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norman A. Stillman pp 22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Byzantine Studies 2006, pp 29"/&gt; Following the division of the Roman Empire in 395, the Byzantine Empire, with its capital at [[Constantinople]], continued as Persia's principal western enemy, and main enemy in general. Hostilities between the two empires became more frequent.&lt;ref name="Chamber" /&gt; The Sassanids, similar to the Roman Empire, were in a constant state of conflict with neighboring kingdoms and nomadic hordes. Although the threat of nomadic incursions could never be fully resolved, the Sassanids generally dealt much more successfully with these matters than did the Romans, due to their policy of making coordinated campaigns against threatening nomads.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolle, pp. 15–18&lt;/ref&gt;

The last of the many and frequent wars with the Byzantines, the climactic [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], which included the [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|siege of the Byzantine capital Constantinople]], ended with both rivalling sides having drastically exhausted their human and material resources. Furthermore, [[Fall of the Sasanian Empire#Social problems|social conflict within the Empire]] had considerably weakened it further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Liska|title=Expanding Realism: The Historical Dimension of World Politics|year=1998|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Pub Incorporated|isbn=978-0-8476-8680-3|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://occawlonline.pearsoned.com/bookbind/pubbooks/stearns_awl/chapter12/objectives/deluxe-content.html |title=The Rise and Spread of Islam, The Arab Empire of the Umayyads -Weakness of the Adversary Empires |publisher=Occawlonline.pearsoned.com |accessdate=21 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715060819/http://occawlonline.pearsoned.com/bookbind/pubbooks/stearns_awl/chapter12/objectives/deluxe-content.html |archivedate=15 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, they were vulnerable to the sudden emergence of the Islamic [[Rashidun Caliphate]], whose forces invaded both empires only a few years after the war. The [[Rashidun army|Muslim forces]] swiftly [[Muslim conquests|conquered]] the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|entire Sasanian Empire]] and in the [[Byzantine–Arab Wars]] deprived the Byzantine Empire of its [[Muslim conquest of Syria|territories in the Levant]], [[Arab conquest of Armenia|the Caucasus]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]]. Over the following centuries, half the Byzantine Empire and the entire Sasanian Empire came under Muslim rule.

In general, over the span of the centuries, in the west, Sassanid territory abutted that of the large and stable Roman state, but to the east, its nearest neighbors were the [[Kushan Empire]] and nomadic tribes such as the [[Hephthalite|White Huns]]. The construction of fortifications such as [[Tus citadel]] or the city of [[Nishapur]], which later became a center of learning and trade, also assisted in defending the eastern provinces from attack.

In south and central Arabia, [[Bedouin|Bedouin Arab]] tribes occasionally raided the Sassanid empire. The [[Lakhmids|Kingdom of Al-Hirah]], a Sassanid vassal kingdom, was established to form a buffer zone between the empire's heartland and the Bedouin tribes. The dissolution of the Kingdom of Al-Hirah by Khosrau II in 602 contributed greatly to decisive Sassanid defeats suffered against Bedouin Arabs later in the century. These defeats resulted in a sudden takeover of the Sassanid empire by Bedouin tribes under the Islamic banner.

[[File:Derbent winter.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sassanian]] fortress in [[Derbent]], [[Dagestan]]. Now inscribed on [[Russia]]'s [[UNESCO]] world heritage list since 2003.]]

In the north, [[Khazar]]s and other Turkic nomads frequently assaulted the northern provinces of the empire. They plundered [[Media (region)|Media]] in 634. Shortly thereafter, the Persian army defeated them and drove them out. The Sassanids built numerous fortifications in the Caucasus region to halt these attacks, of which perhaps the most notably are the imposing fortifications built in [[Derbent]] ([[Dagestan]], [[North Caucasus]], now a part of [[Russia]]) that to a large extent, have remained intact up to this day.

On the eastern side of the Caspian Sea, the Sassanians erected the [[Great Wall of Gorgan]], a 200&amp;nbsp;km-long defensive structure probably aimed to protect the empire from northern peoples, such as the [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]].

===War with Axum===
{{main article|Abyssinian–Persian wars}}
[[File:Khosrau I Textile.jpg|thumb|Egyptian woven pattern woolen curtain or trousers, which was a copy of a Sassanid silk import, which was in turn based on a fresco of King [[Khosrau II]] fighting [[Axum]] [[Ethiopia]]n forces in [[Yemen]], 5–6th century]]
In 522, before Khosrau's reign, a group of monophysite [[Kingdom of Axum|Axumites]] led an attack on the dominant [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyarites]] of southern Arabia. The local Arab leader was able to resist the attack but appealed to the Sassanians for aid, while the Axumites subsequently turned towards the Byzantines for help. The Axumites sent another force across the [[Red Sea]] and this time successfully killed the Arab leader and replaced him with an Axumite man to be king of the region.&lt;ref name="FryeAncient"&gt;Frye Ancient Iran&lt;/ref&gt;

In 531, Justinian suggested that the Axumites of [[Yemen]] should cut out the Persians from Indian trade by maritime trade with the Indians. The Ethiopians never met this request because an Axumite general named Abraha took control of the Yemenite throne and created an independent nation.&lt;ref name="FryeAncient" /&gt; After Abraha's death one of his sons, Ma'd-Karib, went into exile while his half-brother took the throne. After being denied by Justinian, Ma'd-Karib sought help from Khosrau, who sent a small fleet and army under commander [[Vahriz]] to depose the new king of Yemen. After capturing the capital city San'a'l, Ma'd-Karib's son, Saif, was put on the throne.&lt;ref name="FryeAncient" /&gt;

Justinian was ultimately responsible for Sassanian maritime presence in Yemen. By not providing the Yemenite Arabs support, Khosrau was able to help Ma'd-Karib and subsequently established Yemen as a principality of the Sassanian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Farrokh 2007, 237&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with China===
{{Main article|Iran-China relations}}

Like their predecessors the Parthians, the Sassanid Empire carried out active foreign relations with China, and ambassadors from Persia frequently traveled to China. Chinese documents report on thirteen Sassanid embassies to China. Commercially, land and sea trade with China was important to both the Sassanid and Chinese Empires. Large numbers of Sassanid coins have been found in southern China, confirming maritime trade.

On different occasions, Sassanid kings sent their most talented Persian musicians and dancers to the Chinese imperial court at [[Luoyang]] during the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] and [[Northern Wei]] dynasties, and to [[Chang'an]] during the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] dynasties. Both empires benefited from trade along the [[Silk Road]] and shared a common interest in preserving and protecting that trade. They cooperated in guarding the trade routes through central Asia, and both built outposts in border areas to keep caravans safe from nomadic tribes and bandits.

Politically, there is evidence of several Sassanid and Chinese efforts in forging alliances against the common enemy, the Hephthalites. Upon the rise of the nomadic [[Göktürks]] in Inner Asia, there is also what looks like a collaboration between China and the Sassanids to defuse Turkic advances. Documents from Mt. Mogh talk about the presence of a Chinese general in the service of the king of [[Sogdiana]] at the time of the Arab invasions.

Following the invasion of Iran by Muslim Arabs, [[Peroz III]], son of Yazdegerd III, escaped along with a few Persian nobles and took refuge in the Chinese imperial court. Both Peroz and his son [[Narsieh]] (Chinese ''neh-shie'') were given high titles at the Chinese court. On at least two occasions, the last possibly in 670, Chinese troops were sent with Peroz in order to restore him to the Sassanid throne with mixed results, one possibly ending in a short rule of Peroz in Sakastan, from which we have some remaining numismatic evidence. Narsieh later attained the position of a commander of the Chinese imperial guards, and his descendants lived in China as respected princes, Sassanian refugees fleeing from the Arab conquest to [[Iranians in China|settle in China]]. The Emperor of China at this time was [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]].

[[File: Foreigner on ceiling of Cave 1at Ajanta Caves photograph and drawing.jpg|thumb|Foreign dignitary drinking wine, on ceiling of Cave 1, at [[Ajanta Caves]], possibly depicting the Sasanian embassy to Indian king [[Pulakesin II]] (610–642), photograph and drawing.&lt;ref&gt;The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion, Pia Brancaccio, BRILL, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C&amp;pg=PA82 p.82]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Following the conquest of Iran and neighboring regions, [[Shapur I]] extended his authority northwest of the [[Indian subcontinent]] (Pakistan and Afghanistan). The previously autonomous [[Kushan]]s were obliged to accept his suzerainty.&lt;ref name="Frye298"&gt;Richard N. Frye, ''The History of Ancient Iran'', (C.H. Beck'sche Verlagbuchhandlung, 1984), 298.&lt;/ref&gt; These were the western Kushans which controlled Afghanistan&lt;ref name="Frye298" /&gt; while the eastern Kushans were active in India. Although the Kushan empire declined at the end of the 3rd century, to be replaced by the Indian [[Gupta Empire]] in the 4th century, it is clear that the Sassanids remained relevant in India's northwest throughout this period.

Persia and northwestern India, the latter that made up formerly part of the Kushans, engaged in cultural as well as political intercourse during this period, as certain Sassanid practices spread into the Kushan territories. In particular, the Kushans were influenced by the Sassanid conception of kingship, which spread through the trade of Sassanid silverware and textiles depicting emperors hunting or dispensing justice.

This cultural interchange did not, however, spread Sassanid religious practices or attitudes to the Kushans. While the Sassanids always adhered to a stated policy of religious proselytization, and sporadically engaged in persecution or forced conversion of minority religions, the Kushans preferred to adopt a policy of religious tolerance.

Lower-level cultural interchanges also took place between India and Persia during this period. For example, Persians imported the early form of [[chess]], the ''[[chaturanga]]'' (Middle Persian: ''[[chatrang]]'') from India. In exchange, Persians introduced [[backgammon]] (''Nēw-Ardašēr'') to India.

During Khosrau I's reign, many books were brought from India and translated into [[Middle Persian]]. Some of these later found their way into the literature of the [[Islamic world]] and [[Arabic literature]]. A notable example of this was the translation of the Indian ''[[Panchatantra]]'' by one of Khosrau's ministers, [[Borzuya]]. This translation, known as the ''Kalīlag ud Dimnag'', later made its way into the Arabic literature and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarinkoob|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; The details of Burzoe's legendary journey to India and his daring acquisition of the Panchatantra are written in full detail in [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[Shahnameh]], which says:

{{Cquote|''In Indian books, Borzuya read that on a mountain in that land there grows a plant which when sprinkled over the dead revives them. Borzuya asked [[Khosrau I]] for permission to travel to India to obtain the plant. After a fruitless search, he was led to an ascetic who revealed the secret of the plant to him: The "plant" was word, the "mountain" learning, and the "dead" the ignorant. He told Borzuya of a book, the remedy of ignorance, called the [[Panchatantra|Kalila]], which was kept in a treasure chamber. The king of India gave Borzuya permission to read the [[Panchatantra|Kalila]], provided that he did not make a copy of it. Borzuya accepted the condition but each day memorized a chapter of the book. When he returned to his room he would record what he had memorized that day, thus creating a copy of the book, which he sent to [[Sassanid Empire|Iran]]. In Iran, [[Bozorgmehr]] translated the book into [[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] and, at Borzuya's request, named the first chapter after him.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/borzuya-also-burzoe-a-physician-of-the-time-of-kosrow-i- |title=BORZŪYA – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Society==

===Urbanism and Nomadism===
[[File:Ctesiphon-ruin 1864.jpg|thumb|The Palace of [[Taq Kisra|Taq-i Kisra]] in Sasanian capital [[Ctesiphon]]. The city developed into a rich commercial metropolis. It may have been [[List of largest cities throughout history|the most populous city of the world]] in 570–622.]]
In contrast to Parthian society, the Sassanids renewed emphasis on a [[Charismatic authority|charismatic]] and centralized government. In Sassanid theory, the ideal society could maintain stability and justice, and the necessary instrument for this was a strong monarch.&lt;ref name="Daniel, p. 57"&gt;Daniel, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Sasanians aimed to be an [[Urbanism|urban]] empire, at which they were quite successful. During the late Sasanian period, Mesopotamia had the largest population density in the [[Middle Ages|medieval world]].{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|pp=39-40}} This can be credited to, among other things, the Sasanians founding and re-founding a number of cities, which is talked about in the surviving Middle Persian text [[Šahrestānīhā ī Ērānšahr]] (the provincial capitals of Iran).{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|pp=39-40}} Ardashir I himself built and re-built many cities, which he named after himself, such as [[Veh-Ardashir]] in [[Asoristan]], [[Firuzabad, Fars|Ardashir-Khwarrah]] in [[Fars Province|Pars]] and [[Vahman-Ardashir]] in [[Meshan]]. During the Sasanian period, many cities with the name “Iran-khwarrah" were established. This was because Sasanians wanted to revive [[Avestan|Avesta]] ideology.{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|pp=39-40}}

Many of these cities, both new and old, were populated not only by native ethnic groups, such as the Iranians or Syriacs, but also by the [[deportation|deported]] Roman prisoners of war, such as [[Goths]], [[Slavs]], [[Latin people|Latins]], and others.{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|pp=39-40}} Many of these prisoners were experienced workers, who were used to build things such as cities, bridges, and dams. This allowed the Sasanians to become familiar with Roman technology. The impact these foreigners made on the economy was significant, as many of them were Christians, and the spread of the religion accelerated throughout the empire.{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|pp=39-40}}

Unlike the amount of information about the settled people of the Sasanian Empire, there is little about the nomadic/unsettled ones. It is known that they were called "Kurds" by the Sasanians, and that they regularly served the Sasanian military, particularly the [[Dailamite]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilani]] nomads. This way of handling the nomads continued into the Islamic period, where the service of the Dailamites and Gilanis continued unabated.{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|pp=40-41}}

===Shahanshah===
[[File:Head of king Met 65.126.jpg|upright=0.9|right|thumb|Bust of a Sasanian king, most likely [[Shapur II]].]]
The head of the Sasanian Empire was the ''[[shahanshah]]'' (king of kings), also simply known as the ''shah'' (king). His health and welfare was of high importance--accordingly, the phrase “May you be immortal" was used to reply to him. The Sasanian coins which appeared from the 6th-century and afterwards depict a moon and sun, which, in the words of the Iranian historian [[Touraj Daryaee]], “suggest that the king was at the center of the world and the sun and moon revolved around him. In effect he was the “king of the four corners of the world," which was an old Mesopotamian idea."{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|p=41}} The king saw all other rulers, such as the Romans, Turks, and Chinese, as being beneath him. The king wore colorful clothes, makeup, a heavy crown, while his beard was decorated with gold. The early Sasanian kings considered themselves of divine descent; they called themselves “bay" (divine).{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|p=42}}

When the king went out in public, he was hidden behind a curtain,{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|p=41}} and had some of his men in front of him, whose duty was to keep the masses away from him and to clear the way.{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=92}} When one came to the king, one was expected to prostrate oneself before him, also known as ''[[proskynesis]]''. The king's guards were known as the ''[[Pushtigban Body Guards|pushtigban]]''. On other occasions, the king was protected by a discrete group of palace guards, known as the ''[[darigan]]''. Both of these groups were enlisted from royal families of the Sasanian Empire,{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=92}} and were under the command of the ''[[hazarbed]]'', who was in charge of the king's safety, controlled the entrance of the kings palace, presented visitors to the king, and was allowed military commands or used as a negotiator. The ''hazarbed'' was also allowed in some cases to serve as the royal executioner.{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=92}} During [[Nowruz]] (Iranian new year) and [[Mihragan]] ([[Mithra|Mihr's day]]), the king would hold a speech.{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|p=42}}

===Class division===
Sassanid society was immensely complex, with separate systems of social organization governing numerous different groups within the empire.&lt;ref name="Nicolle, p. 11"&gt;Nicolle, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Historians believe society comprised four&lt;ref&gt;
These four are the three common Indo-European [[Trifunctional hypothesis|social tripartition]] common among ancient Iranian, Indian and Romans with one extra Iranian element (from Yashna xix/17). cf. Frye, p. 54.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Why the Middle East Lagged Behind: The Case of Iran|page=72|author=Kāẓim ʻAlamdārī|publisher=University Press of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[social class]]es:

# Asronan (priests)
# Arteshtaran (warriors)
# Wastaryoshan (commoners)
# Hutukhshan (artisans)

At the center of the Sasanian [[caste]] system the ''shahanshah'' ruled over all the nobles.&lt;ref name="Zarinkoob, p. 201"&gt;Zarinkoob, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; The royal princes, petty rulers, great landlords and priests, together constituted a privileged stratum, and were identified as ''[[wuzurgan]]'', or grandees. This social system appears to have been fairly rigid.&lt;ref name="Chamber"/&gt;

The Sasanian caste system outlived the empire, continuing in the early Islamic period.&lt;ref name="Zarinkoob, p. 201"/&gt;

===Slavery===
In general, mass slavery was never practiced by the Iranians, and in many cases the situation and lives of semi-slaves (prisoners of war) were, in fact, better than those of the commoner.&lt;ref&gt;Farazmand, Ali (1998) “Persian/Iranian Administrative Tradition", in Jay M. Shafritz (Editor), ''International Encyclopedia of Public Policy and Administration''. Boulder, CO: [[Westview Press]], pp 1640–1645&amp;nbsp;– Excerpt: "Persians never practiced mass slavery, and in many cases the situations and lives of semi-slaves (prisoners of war) were in fact better than the common citizens of Persia." (pg 1642)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "slave" was also used for debtors who had to use some of their time to serve in a [[Fire temple|fire-temple]].{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|pp=58-59}}

The most common slaves in the Sasanian Empire were the household servants, who worked in private estates and at the fire-temples. Usage of a woman slave in a home was common, and her master had outright control over her and could even produce children with her if he wanted to. Slaves also received wages and were able to have their own families whether they were female or male.{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|pp=58-59}} Harming a slave was considered a crime, and not even the king himself was allowed to do it.&lt;ref name="D. Irani, Morris Silver 1995, p.87"&gt;K. D. Irani, Morris Silver, ''Social Justice in the Ancient World '', 224 pp., Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995, {{ISBN|0-313-29144-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-313-29144-9}} (see p.87)&lt;/ref&gt;

The master of a slave was allowed to free the person when he wanted to, which, no matter what faith the slave believed in, was considered a good deed.&lt;ref name="D. Irani, Morris Silver 1995, p.87"/&gt; A slave could also be freed if his/her master died.{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|pp=58-59}}

==Culture==

===Education===
{{see also|Academy of Gondishapur}}
There was a major school, called the Grand School, in the capital. In the beginning, only 50 students were allowed to study at the Grand School. In less than 100 years, enrollment at the Grand School was over 30,000 students.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Society===

Membership in a class was based on birth, although it was possible for an exceptional individual to move to another class on the basis of merit. The function of the king was to ensure that each class remained within its proper boundaries, so that the strong did not oppress the weak, nor the weak the strong. To maintain this social equilibrium was the essence of royal justice, and its effective functioning depended on the glorification of the monarchy above all other classes.&lt;ref name="Daniel, p. 57"/&gt;

On a lower level, Sasanian society was divided into [[Sasanian Army#Azadan nobility|Azatan]] (freemen), who jealously guarded their status as descendants of ancient [[Aryan]] conquerors, and the mass of originally non-Aryan peasantry. The Azatan formed a large low-aristocracy of low-level administrators, mostly living on small estates. The Azatan provided the cavalry backbone of the [[Sasanian army]].&lt;ref name="Nicolle, p. 11"/&gt;

[[File:Sassanid silver plate depicting a lion hunt by Nickmard Khoey.jpg|thumb|A Sasanian silver plate depicting a royal lion hunt]]

The Sasanian kings were enlightened patrons of letters and philosophy. Khosrau I had the works of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] translated into Pahlavi taught at Gundishapur, and even read them himself. During his reign, many historical annals were compiled, of which the sole survivor is the [[Karnamak-i Artaxshir-i Papakan]] (Deeds of Ardashir), a mixture of history and romance that served as the basis of the Iranian national epic, the [[Shahnameh]]. When Justinian I closed the schools of [[Athens]], seven of their professors fled to Persia and found refuge at Khosrau's court. In time they grew homesick, and in his treaty of 533 with Justinian, the Sasanian king stipulated that the Greek sages should be allowed to return and be free from persecution.&lt;ref name="Durant"&gt;Durant.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Khosrau I, the [[Academy of Gundishapur]], which had been founded in the 5th century, became "the greatest intellectual center of the time", drawing students and teachers from every quarter of the known world. [[Nestorian Christian]]s were received there, and brought [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translations of Greek works in medicine and philosophy. Neoplatonists too, came to Gundishapur, where they planted the seeds of [[Sufi]] [[mysticism]]; the medical lore of India, Persia, Syria and Greece mingled there to produce a flourishing school of therapy.&lt;ref name="Durant" /&gt;

Artistically, the Sasanian period witnessed some of the highest achievements of [[Culture of Iran|Iranian civilization]]. Much of what later became known as Muslim culture, including architecture and writing, was originally drawn from Persian culture. At its peak, the Sasanian Empire stretched from western Anatolia to northwest India (nowadays Afghanistan/Pakistan), but its influence was felt far beyond these political boundaries. Sasanian motifs found their way into the art of [[Central Asia]] and China, the [[Byzantine Empire]], and even [[Merovingian]] France. [[Islamic art]] however, was the true heir to Sasanian art, whose concepts it was to assimilate while, at the same time instilling fresh life and renewed vigor into it.&lt;ref name="Iransaga: The art of Sassanians"/&gt; According to [[Will Durant]]:

{{Cquote|''Sasanian art exported its forms and motifs eastward into India, Turkestan and China, westward into Syria, Asia Minor, Constantinople, the Balkans, Egypt and Spain. Probably its influence helped to change the emphasis in Greek art from classic representation to Byzantine ornament, and in Latin Christian art from wooden ceilings to brick or stone vaults and domes and buttressed walls.''&lt;ref name="Durant" /&gt;}}
Sasanian carvings at [[Taq-e Bostan]] and [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] were colored; so were many features of the palaces; but only traces of such painting remain. The literature, however, makes it clear that the art of painting flourished in Sasanian times; the prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] is reported to have founded a school of painting; [[Firdowsi]] speaks of Persian magnates adorning their mansions with pictures of Iranian heroes; and the poet al-Buhturi describes the murals in the palace at Ctesiphon. When a Sasanian king died, the best painter of the time was called upon to make a portrait of him for a collection kept in the royal treasury.

Painting, [[sculpture]], [[pottery]], and other forms of decoration shared their designs with Sasanian textile art. Silks, embroideries, [[brocade]]s, [[damask]]s, [[tapestries]], chair covers, canopies, tents and rugs were woven with patience and masterly skill, and were dyed in warm tints of yellow, blue and green. Every Persian but the peasant and the priest aspired to dress above his class; presents often took the form of sumptuous garments; and great colorful carpets had been an appendage of wealth in the East since [[Assyria]]n days. The two dozen Sasanian textiles that have survived are among the most highly valued fabrics in existence. Even in their own day, Sasanian textiles were admired and imitated from Egypt to the Far East; and during the [[Middle Ages]], they were favored for clothing the relics of Christian saints. When [[Heraclius]] captured the palace of [[Khosrau II|Khosrau II Parvez]] at [[Dastagird|Dastagerd]], delicate embroideries and an immense rug were among his most precious spoils. Famous was the "Winter Carpet", also known as "Khosrau's Spring" (Spring Season Carpet قالى بهارستان) of [[Khosrau I|Khosrau Anushirvan]], designed to make him forget winter in its spring and summer scenes: flowers and fruits made of inwoven rubies and diamonds grew, in this carpet, beside walks of silver and brooks of pearls traced on a ground of gold. [[Harun al-Rashid]] prided himself on a spacious Sasanian rug thickly studded with jewelry. Persians wrote love poems about their rugs.&lt;ref name="Durant" /&gt;

Studies on Sasanian remains show over 100 types of crowns being worn by Sasanian kings. The various Sasanian crowns demonstrate the cultural, economic, social and historical situation in each period. The crowns also show the character traits of each king in this era. Different symbols and signs on the crowns–the moon, stars, eagle and palm, each illustrate the wearer's religious faith and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=http://www.livius.org/sao-sd/sassanids/sassanid-crowns.html |title=Sasanian crowns |publisher=Livius.org |date=2006-03-31 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chn.ir/en/news/?section=2&amp;id=4471 Iranian cultural heritage news agency (CHN)] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sasanian Dynasty, like the Achaemenid, originated in the province of [[Fars Province|Pars]]. The Sasanians saw themselves as successors of the Achaemenids, after the [[Hellenistic]] and Parthian interlude, and believed that it was their destiny to restore the greatness of Persia.

In reviving the glories of the [[Achaemenid Dynasty|Achaemenid]] past, the Sasanians were no mere imitators. The art of this period reveals an astonishing virility, in certain respects anticipating key features of Islamic art. Sasanian art combined elements of traditional Persian art with Hellenistic elements and influences. The conquest of [[Persian Empire|Persia]] by [[Alexander the Great]] had inaugurated the spread of [[Hellenistic art]] into Western Asia. Though the East accepted the outward form of this art, it never really assimilated its spirit. Already in the [[Parthia]]n period, Hellenistic art was being interpreted freely by the peoples of the Near East. Throughout the Sasanian period, there was reaction against it. Sasanian art revived forms and traditions native to Persia, and in the Islamic period, these reached the shores of the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Parviz Marzban, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fergusson:

{{Cquote|''With the accession of the [Sasanians], Persia regained much of that power and stability to which she had been so long a stranger&amp;nbsp;... The improvement in the fine arts at home indicates returning prosperity, and a degree of security unknown since the fall of the Achaemenidae.''&lt;ref&gt;Fergusson, ''History of Architecture'', vol. i, 3rd edition, pp. 381−3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

Surviving palaces illustrate the splendor in which the Sasanian monarchs lived. Examples include palaces at [[Firuzabad, Fars|Firuzabad]] and [[Bishapur]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]], and the capital city of [[Ctesiphon]] in the [[Asoristan]] province (present-day [[Iraq]]). In addition to local traditions, Parthian architecture influenced Sasanian architectural characteristics. All are characterized by the barrel-vaulted [[iwan]]s introduced in the Parthian period. During the Sasanian period, these reached massive proportions, particularly at Ctesiphon. There, the arch of the great vaulted hall, attributed to the reign of Shapur I (241–272), has a span of more than {{convert|80|ft|m}} and reaches a height of {{convert|118|ft|m}}. This magnificent structure fascinated architects in the centuries that followed and has been considered one of the most important examples of [[Persian architecture]]. Many of the palaces contain an inner audience hall consisting, as at Firuzabad, of a chamber surmounted by a dome. The Persians solved the problem of constructing a circular dome on a square building by employing [[squinch]]es, or arches built across each corner of the square, thereby converting it into an octagon on which it is simple to place the dome. The dome chamber in the palace of Firuzabad is the earliest surviving example of the use of the squinch, suggesting that this architectural technique was probably invented in Persia.

The unique characteristic of Sasanian architecture was its distinctive use of space. The Sasanian architect conceived his building in terms of masses and surfaces; hence the use of massive walls of brick decorated with molded or carved stucco. Stucco wall decorations appear at Bishapur, but better examples are preserved from [[Chal Tarkhan]] near [[Rey, Iran|Rey]] (late Sasanian or early Islamic in date), and from Ctesiphon and [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] in Mesopotamia. The panels show animal figures set in roundels, human busts, and geometric and floral motifs.

At Bishapur, some of the floors were decorated with [[mosaic]]s showing scenes of banqueting. The Roman influence here is clear, and the mosaics may have been laid by Roman prisoners. Buildings were decorated with wall paintings. Particularly fine examples have been found on [[Mount Khajeh]] in [[Sistan and Baluchistan|Sistan]].

==Economy==

[[File:Textile0001.jpg|thumb|Sasanian silk twill textile of a [[simurgh]] in a beaded surround, 6th–7th century. Used in the reliquary of [[Saint Len]], Paris]]
Due to the majority of the inhabitants being of peasant stock, the Sasanian economy relied on farming and agriculture, Khuzestan and Iraq being the most important provinces for it. The [[Nahrawan Canal|Nahravan Canal]] is one of the greatest examples of Sasanian irrigation systems, and many of these things can still be found in Iran. The mountains of the Sasanian state were used for lumbering by the nomads of the region, and the centralized nature of the Sasanian state allowed it to impose taxes on the nomads and inhabitants of the mountains. During the reign of Khosrau I, further land was brought under centralized administration.&lt;ref name="Tafazzoli &amp; Khromov, p. 48"&gt;Tafazzoli &amp; Khromov, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Two trade routes were used during the Sasanian period: one in the north, the famous [[Silk Route]], and one less prominent route on the southern Sasanian coast. The factories of [[Susa]], [[Gundeshapur]], and [[Shushtar]] were famously known for their production of silk, and rivaled the Chinese factories. The Sasanians showed great toleration to the inhabitants of the countryside, which allowed the latter to stockpile in case of famine.&lt;ref name="Tafazzoli &amp; Khromov, p. 48"/&gt;

===Industry and trade===
[[File:Indo-Sassanid.jpg|thumb|Sasanian sea [[trade route]]s]]
Persian industry under the Sasanians developed from domestic to urban forms. Guilds were numerous. Good roads and bridges, well patrolled, enabled state post and merchant caravans to link Ctesiphon with all provinces; and harbors were built in the Persian Gulf to quicken trade with India.&lt;ref name=Durant /&gt; Sasanian merchants ranged far and wide and gradually ousted Romans from the lucrative Indian Ocean trade routes.&lt;ref name="Nicolle, p. 6"&gt;Nicolle, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Recent archeological discovery has shown the interesting fact that Sasanians used special labels (commercial labels) on goods as a way of promoting their brands and distinguish between different qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/04/aug/1199.html |title=Sassanids Used Commercial Labels: Iranian Archeologists|date=21 August 2009|publisher=Payvand|accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khosrau I further extended the already vast trade network. The Sasanian state now tended toward monopolistic control of trade, with luxury goods assuming a far greater role in the trade than heretofore, and the great activity in building of ports, caravanserais, bridges and the like, was linked to trade and urbanization. The Persians dominated international trade, both in the [[Indian Ocean]], Central Asia and South Russia, in the time of Khosrau, although competition with the Byzantines was at times intense. Sassanian settlements in [[Oman]] and [[Yemen]] testify to the importance of trade with India, but the silk trade with China was mainly in the hands of Sasanian vassals and the Iranian people, the [[Iranian peoples|Sogdians]].&lt;ref&gt;Frye, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

The main exports of the Sasanians were silk; woolen and golden textiles; carpets and rugs; hides; and leather and pearls from the [[Persian Gulf]]. There were also goods in transit from China (paper, silk) and India (spices), which Sasanian customs imposed taxes upon, and which were re-exported from the Empire to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Sarfaraz, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also a time of increased metallurgical production, so Iran earned a reputation as the "armory of Asia". Most of the Sasanian mining centers were at the fringes of the Empire – in Armenia, the Caucasus and above all, [[Transoxania]]. The extraordinary mineral wealth of the [[Pamir Mountains]] on the eastern horizon of the Sasanian empire led to a legend among the [[Tājik people|Tajiks]], an Iranian people living there, which is still told today. It said that when God was creating the world, he tripped over the Pamirs, dropping his jar of minerals, which spread across the region.&lt;ref name="Nicolle, p. 6"/&gt;

==Religion==
{{Main article|Zoroastrianism}}

===Zoroastrianism===

Under [[Arsacid Empire|Parthian rule]], Zoroastrianism had fragmented into regional variations which also saw the rise of local cult-deities, some from Iranian religious tradition but others drawn from [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] tradition too. Greek paganism and religious ideas had spread and mixed with Zoroastrianism when [[Alexander the Great]] had conquered the [[Persian Empire]] from [[Darius III]]--a process of Greco-Persian religious and cultural synthesisation which had continued into the Parthian era. However, under the Sassanids, an orthodox Zoroastrianism was revived and the religion would undergo numerous and important developments.

Sassanid Zoroastrianism would develop to have clear distinctions from the practices laid out in the [[Avesta]], the holy books of Zoroastrianism. It is often argued that the Sassanid Zoroastrian clergy later modified the religion in a way to serve themselves, causing substantial religious uneasiness.{{Specify|date=November 2007}} Sassanid religious policies contributed to the flourishing of numerous religious reform movements, most importantly the [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] and [[Mazdak]] religions.

The relationship between the Sassanid Kings and the religions practiced in their empire became complex and varied. For instance, while [[Shapur I]] tolerated and encouraged a variety of religions and seems to have been a [[Zurvanism|Zurvanite]] himself, religious minorities at times were suppressed under later Kings, such as [[Bahram II]]. Shapur II, on the other hand, tolerated religious groups except Christians, whom he only persecuted in the wake of Constantine's conversion.&lt;ref name="Ehsan Yarshater 1983 pp. 879"&gt;Ehsan Yarshater.

====Tansar and his justification for Ardashir I's rebellion====
From the very beginning of Sassanid rule in 224 an orthodox [[Fars Province|Pars]]-oriented Zoroastrian tradition would play an important part in influencing and lending legitimization to the state until its collapse in the mid-7th century. After [[Ardashir I]] had deposed the last [[Arsacid Empire|Parthian]] King, [[Artabanus V (of Parthia)|Artabanus V]], he sought the aid of [[Tansar]], a ''[[herbad]]'' (high priest) of the Iranian Zoroastrians to aid him in acquiring legitimization for the new dynasty. This Tansar did by writing to the nominal and vassal kings in different regions of [[Iran]] to accept Ardashir I as their new King, most notably in the ''[[Letter of Tansar]]'', which was addressed to [[Gushnasp]], the vassal king of [[Tabarestan]]. Gushnasp had accused Ardashir I of having forsaken tradition by usurping the throne, and that while his actions 'may have been good for the World' they were 'bad for the faith'. Tansar refuted these charges in his letter to Gushnasp by proclaiming that not all of the old ways had been good, and that Ardashir was more virtuous than his predecessors. The ''Letter of Tansar'' included some attacks on the religious practices and orientation of the Parthians, who did not follow an orthodox Zoroastrian tradition but rather a heterodox one, and so attempted to justify Ardashir's rebellion against them by arguing that Zoroastrianism had 'decayed' after Alexander's invasion, a decay which had continued under the Parthians and so needed to be 'restored'.&lt;ref name="Zoroastrians 2000"&gt;''Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices'', 2nd edition. Mary Boyce, (Routledge; Dec 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tansar]] would later help to oversee the formation of a single 'Zoroastrian church' under the control of the Persian [[magi]], alongside the establishment of a single set of [[Avesta]]n texts, which he himself approved and authorised.

====Influence of Kartir====
[[Kartir]], a very powerful and influential Persian cleric, served under several Sassanid Kings and actively campaigned for the establishment of a [[Fars province|Pars]]-centred Zoroastrian orthodoxy across the Sassanid Empire. His power and influence grew so much that he became the only 'commoner' to later be allowed to have his own rock inscriptions carved in the royal fashion (at [[Sar Mashhad]], [[Naqsh-e Rostam]], [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]] and [[Naqsh-e Rajab]]). Under [[Shapur I]], Kartir was made the 'absolute authority' over the 'order of priests' at the Sassanid court and throughout the empire's regions too, with the implication that all regional Zoroastrian clergies would now for the first time be subordinated to the Persian Zoroastrian clerics of [[Fars province|Pars]]. To some extent Kartir was an [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]] and took it upon himself to help establish numerous Bahram fires throughout Iran in the place of the 'bagins / ayazans' (monuments and temples containing images and idols of cult-deities) that had proliferated during the Parthian era. In expressing his doctrinal orthodoxy, Kartir also encouraged an obscure Zoroastrian concept known as ''khvedodah'' among the common-folk (marriage within the family; between siblings, cousins). At various stages during his long career at court, Kartir also oversaw the periodic persecution of the non-Zoroastrians in Iran, and secured the execution of the prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] during the reign of [[Bahram I]]. During the reign of [[Hormizd I]] (the predecessor and brother of Bahram I) Kartir was awarded the new Zoroastrian title of ''mobad'' – a clerical title that was to be considered higher than that of the eastern-Iranian (Parthian) title of ''herbad''.&lt;ref name="Zoroastrians 2000"/&gt;

====Zoroastrian calendar reforms under the Sasanians====
The Persians had long known of the Egyptian calendar, with its 365 days divided into 12 months. However, the traditional Zoroastrian calendar had 12 months of 30 days each. During the reign of [[Ardashir I]], an effort was made to introduce a more accurate Zoroastrian calendar for the year, so 5 extra days were added to it. These 5 extra days were named the [[Gatha days]] and had a practical as well as religious use. However, they were still kept apart from the 'religious year', so as not to disturb the long-held observances of the older Zoroastrian calendar.

Some difficulties arose with the introduction of the first calendar reform, particularly the pushing forward of important Zoroastrian festivals such as Hamaspat-maedaya and [[Nowruz]] on the calendar year by year. This confusion apparently caused much distress among ordinary people, and while the Sassanids tried to enforce the observance of these great celebrations on the new official dates, much of the populace continued to observe them on the older, traditional dates, and so parallel celebrations for Nowruz and other Zoroastrian celebrations would often occur within days of each other, in defiance of the new official calendar dates, causing much confusion and friction between the laity and the ruling class. A compromise on this by the Sassanids was later introduced, by linking the parallel celebrations as a 6-day celebration/feast. This was done for all except Nowruz.

A further problem occurred as Nowruz had shifted in position during this period from the [[spring equinox]] to [[autumn]], although this inconsistency with the original spring-equinox date for Nowruz had possibly occurred during the Parthian period too.

Further calendar reforms occurred during the later Sassanid era. Ever since the reforms under [[Ardashir I]] there had been no intercalation. Thus with a quarter day being lost each year, the Zoroastrian holy year had slowly slipped backwards, with Nowruz eventually ending up in July. A great council was therefore convened and it was decided that Nowruz be moved back to the original position it had during the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] period - back to [[spring (season)|spring]]. This change probably took place during the reign of [[Kavad I]] in the early 6th century. Much emphasis seems to have been placed during this period on the importance of spring and on its connection with the resurrection and ''[[Frashegerd]]''.&lt;ref name="Zoroastrians 2000"/&gt;

====Three Great Fires====
[[File:Takhte Soleyman.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Takht-e Soleymān|Adur Gushnasp]], one of three main Zoroastrian temples in the Sassanian Empire]]

Reflecting the regional rivalry and bias the Sassanids are believed to have held against their [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] predecessors, it was probably during the Sassanid era that the two great fires in [[Fars province|Pars]] and [[Media (region)|Media]]—the ''[[Adur Farnbag]]'' and ''[[Adur Gushnasp]]'' respectively—were promoted to rival, and even eclipse, the sacred fire in [[Parthia]], the ''[[Adur Burzen-Mehr]]''. The Adur Burzen-Mehr, linked (in legend) with [[Zoroaster]] and [[Vishtaspa]] (the first Zoroastrian King), was too holy for the Persian magi to end veneration of it completely.

It was therefore during the Sassanid era that the three ''Great Fires'' of the Zoroastrian world were given specific associations. The ''Adur Farnbag'' in Pars became associated with the [[magi]], ''Adur Gushnasp'' in Media with warriors, and ''Adur Burzen-Mehr'' in Parthia with the lowest estate, farmers and herdsmen.

The ''Adur Gushnasp'' eventually became, by custom, a place of pilgrimage by foot for newly enthroned Kings after their coronation. It is likely that, during the Sassanid era, these three ''Great Fires'' became central places for pilgrimage among Zoroastrians.&lt;ref name="Zoroastrians 2000" /&gt;

====Iconoclasm and the elevation of Persian over other Iranian languages====
The early Sassanids ruled against the use of cult images in worship, and so statues and idols were removed from many temples and, where possible, sacred fires were installed instead. This policy extended even to the [[Aniran|'non-Iran']] regions of the empire during some periods. Hormizd I allegedly destroyed statues erected for the dead in [[Armenia]]. However, only cult-statues were removed. The Sassanids continued to use images to represent the deities of Zoroastrianism, including that of [[Ahura Mazda]], in the tradition that was established during the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] era.

In the early Sassanid period royal inscriptions often consisted of [[Parthian language|Parthian]], [[Middle Persian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. However, the last time Parthian was used for a royal inscription came during the reign of [[Narseh]], son of [[Shapur I]]. It is likely therefore that soon after this, the Sassanids made the decision to impose Persian as the sole official language within Iran, and forbade the use of written Parthian. This had important consequences for Zoroastrianism, given that all secondary literature, including the [[Zend|Zand]], was then recorded only in [[Middle Persian]], having a profound impact in orienting Zoroastrianism towards the influence of the [[Fars province|Pars]] region, the homeland of the Sassanids.&lt;ref name="Zoroastrians 2000" /&gt;

====Developments in Zoroastrian literature and liturgy by the Sasanians====
Some scholars of Zoroastrianism such as [[Mary Boyce]] have speculated that it is possible that the ''[[yasna]]'' service was lengthened during the Sassanid era 'to increase its impressiveness'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Their Religious Beliefs and Practices The Library of Religious Beliefs and Practices|author=Mark Boyce|pages=123–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to have been done by joining the [[Gathas|Gathic]] ''[[Staota Yesnya]]'' with the ''[[haoma]]'' ceremony. Furthermore, it is believed that another longer service developed, known as the ''[[Visperad]]'', which derived from the extended yasna. This was developed for the celebration of the seven holy days of obligation (the ''[[Gahambars]]'' plus ''[[Nowruz]]'') and was dedicated to ''[[Ahura Mazda]]''.

While the very earliest Zoroastrians eschewed writing as a form of demonic practice, the [[Middle Persian]] [[Avesta#The Zend|Zand]], along with much secondary Zoroastrian literature, was recorded in writing during the Sassanid era for the first time. Many of these Zoroastrian texts were original works from the Sassanid period. Perhaps the most important of these works was the ''[[Bundahishn]]'' – the mythical Zoroastrian story of 'Creation'. Other older works, some from remote antiquity, were possibly translated from different Iranian languages into Middle Persian during this period. For example, two works, the ''[[Drakht-i Asurig]]'' (Assyrian Tree) and ''[[Yadegar-e Zariran|Ayadgar-i Zareran]]'' (Exploits of Zarter) were probably translated from [[Parthian language|Parthian]] originals.

[[File:Bodleian J2 fol 175 Y 28 1.jpg|thumb|The Sasanians developed an accurate, phonetic alphabet to write down the sacred [[Avesta]]]]
Of great importance for Zoroastrianism was the creation of the [[Avestan alphabet]] by the Sassanids, which enabled the accurate rendering of the [[Avesta]] in written form (including in its original language/phonology) for the first time. The alphabet was based on the [[Pahlavi alphabet|Pahlavi]] one, but rather than the inadequacy of that script for recording spoken Middle Persian, the Avestan alphabet had 46 letters, and was well suited to recording [[Avestan language|Avestan]] in written form in the way the language actually sounded and was uttered. The Persian [[magi]] were therefore finally able to record all surviving ancient Avestan texts in written form.

As a result of this development, the Sasanian Avesta was then compiled into 21 nasks (divisions) to correspond with the 21 words of the ''[[Ahuna Vairya|Ahunavar]]'' invocation. The nasks were further divided into three groups of seven. The first group contained the ''[[Gathas]]'' and all texts associated with them, while the second group contained works of scholastic learning. The final section contained treatises of instruction for the magi, such as the ''[[Vendidad]]'', law-texts and other works, such as ''[[yashts]]''.

An important literary text, the ''[[Khwaday-Namag]]'' (Book of Kings), was composed during the Sasanian era. This text is the basis of the later ''[[Shahnameh]]'' of [[Ferdowsi]]. Another important Zoroastrian text from the Sasanian period includes the ''[[Menog-i Khrad|Dadestan-e Menog-e Khrad]]'' (Judgments of the Spirit of Wisdom).&lt;ref name="Zoroastrians 2000"/&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main article|Church of the East|Maphrianate of the East}}
{{See also|Christianisation of Armenia|Church of Caucasian Albania}}
Christians in the Sasanian Empire belonged mainly to the [[Nestorian Church]] (Church of the East) and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite Church]] (Syriac Orthodox Church) branches of Christianity. Although these churches originally maintained ties with Christian churches in the Roman Empire, they were indeed quite different from them. One reason for this was that the [[liturgical language]] of the Nestorian and Jacobite Churches was [[Syriac language|Syriac]] rather than Greek, the language of Roman Christianity during the early centuries (and the language of Eastern Roman Christianity in later centuries). Another reason for a separation between Eastern and Western Christianity was strong pressure from the Sasanian authorities to sever connections with Rome, since the Sasanian Empire was often at war with the Roman Empire.

Christianity was recognized by king Yazdegerd I in 409 as an allowable faith within the Sasanian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander A. Vasiliev, ''History of the Byzantine Empire, 324–1453'', Vol. I,  (University of Wisconsin Press, 1980), 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major break with mainstream Christianity came in 431, due to the pronouncements of the [[First Council of Ephesus]]. The Council condemned [[Nestorius]], a theologian of Cilician/Kilikian origin and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|patriarch of Constantinople]], for teaching a view of [[Christology]] in accordance with which he refused to call Mary, the mother of [[Jesus Christ]], "[[Theotokos]]" or Mother of God. While the teaching of the Council of Ephesus was accepted within the Roman Empire, the Sasanian church disagreed with the condemnation of Nestorius' teachings. When Nestorius was deposed as patriarch, a number of his followers fled to the Sasanian Empire. Persian emperors used this opportunity to strengthen Nestorius' position within the Sasanian church (which made up the vast majority of the Christians in the predominantly Zoroastrian Persian Empire) by eliminating the most important pro-Roman clergymen in Persia and making sure that their places were taken by Nestorians. This was to assure that these Christians would be loyal to the Persian Empire, and not to the Roman.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Most of the Christians in the Sasanian empire lived on the western edge of the empire, predominantly in Mesopotamia, but there were also important extant communities in the more northern territories, namely [[Caucasian Albania]], Lazica, [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]], and the Persian part of Armenia. Other important communities were to be found on the island of [[Tylos]] (present day [[Bahrain]]), the southern coast of the Persian Gulf, and the area of the [[Arabian]] kingdom of [[Lakhmids|Lakhm]]. Some of these areas were the earliest to be Christianized; the kingdom of [[Armenia]] became the first independent Christian state in the world in 301. While a number of Assyrian territories had almost become fully Christianized even earlier during the 3rd century, they never became independent nations.&lt;ref name="iranologie" /&gt;

===Other religions===
Some of the recent excavations have discovered the [[Buddhist]], [[Hindu]] and Jewish religious sites in the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conflict and Cooperation: Zoroastrian Subalterns and Muslim Elites in Medieval Iranian Society|page=5|publisher=Columbia University Press|author=Front Cover Jamsheed Kairshasp Choksy|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] were competitors of Zoroastrianism in [[Bactria]] and [[Margiana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Civilizations of Central Asia: The crossroads of civilizations, A.D. 250 to 750|publisher=UNESCO|author1=Ahmad Hasan Dani |author2=B. A. Litvinsky |page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the far easternmost territories. A very large Jewish community flourished under Sasanian rule, with thriving centers at [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], [[Babylon]] and [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], and with its own semiautonomous ''Exilarchate'' leadership based in Mesopotamia. Jewish communities suffered only occasional persecution. They enjoyed a relative freedom of religion, and were granted privileges denied to other religious minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Zarinkoob, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Shapur I (Shabur Malka in Aramaic) was a particular friend to the Jews. His friendship with [[Samuel of Nehardea|Shmuel]] produced many advantages for the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;Zarinkoob, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; He even offered the Jews in the Sasanian empire a fine white Nisaean horse, just in case the Messiah, who was thought to ride a donkey or a mule, would come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=http://www.livius.org/ne-nn/nisaia/nisaia.html |title=Livius article on Sassanid Empire |publisher=Livius.org |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shapur II, whose mother was Jewish, had a similar friendship with a Babylonian rabbi named [[Rabbah bar Nahmani|Rabbah]]. Raba's friendship with Shapur II enabled him to secure a relaxation of the oppressive laws enacted against the Jews in the Persian Empire. Moreover, in the eastern portion of the empire, various Buddhist places of worship, notably in [[Bamyan City|Bamiyan]], were active as Buddhism gradually became more popular in that region.

==Language==

===Official languages===
During the early Sasanian period, [[Middle Persian]] along with [[Koine Greek|Greek]] and [[Parthian language|Parthian]] appeared in the inscriptions of the early Sasanian kings. However, by the time Narseh (r. 293–302) was ruling, Greek was no longer in use, perhaps due to the disappearance of Greek or the efforts of the anti-Hellenic Zoroastrian clergy to remove it once and for all. This was probably also because Greek was commonplace among the Romans/Byzantines, the rivals of the Sasanians.{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|pp=99-100}} Parthian soon disappeared as an administrative language too, but was continued to be spoken and written in the eastern part of the Sasanian Empire, the homeland of the Parthians.{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|pp=116-117}} Furthermore, many of the Parthian aristocrats who had entered into Sasanian service after the fall of the [[Parthian Empire]] still spoke Parthian, such as the seven Parthian clans, who possessed much power within the empire. Sometimes one of the members of the clans would even protest against Sasanian rule.

[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], like in the [[Achaemenid Empire]], was widely used in the Sasanian Empire, and provided [[Aramaic alphabet|scripts]] for Middle Persian and other languages.&lt;ref name="Chyet 1997 284"/&gt;

===Regional languages===
Although Middle Persian was the native language of the Sasanians (who, however, were not originally from [[Fars Province|Pars]]), it was only a minority spoken-language in the vast Sasanian Empire; it only formed the majority of Pars, while it was widespread around [[Media (region)|Media]] and its surrounding regions. However, there were several different Persian dialects during that time. Besides Persian, [[Old Azeri language|Adhari]] along with one of its dialects, [[Tati language (Iran)|Tati]], was spoken in [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Adurbadagan]] (Azerbaijan). [[Daylamite language|Daylamite]] and [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]] was spoken in [[Gilan]], while [[Mazanderani language|Mazandarani]] (also known as Tabari) was spoken in [[Tabaristan]] ([[Mazandaran]]). Furthermore, many other languages and dialects were spoken in the two regions.{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|p=101}}

In the Sasanian territories in the Caucasus, numerous languages were sproken including [[Georgian language|Georgian]], various [[Kartvelian languages]] (notably in Lazica), Middle Persian,&lt;ref name="VAS"&gt;Shnirelman, V.A.(2001), 'The value of the Past: Myths, Identity and Politics in Transcaucasia', Osaka: National Museum of Ethnology.  pp 79:
"Yet, even at the time of Caucasian Albania and later on, as well, the region was greatly affected by Iran
and Persian enjoyed even more success than the Albanian language".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Caucasian Albanian language|Caucasian Albanian]], [[Scythian languages|Scythian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and others.

In Khuzestan, several languages were spoken; Persian in the north and east, while [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] was spoken in the rest of the place.{{sfn|Christopher Brunner|1975|p=754}} Furthermore, [[Elamite language|Neo-Elamite]] was also spoken in the province.{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|p=101}} In [[Meshan]], the [[Arameans]], along with settled [[Arabs]] (known as Mesenian Arabs), and the nomadic Arabs, formed the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] population of the province along with [[Nabataeans|Nabataean]] and [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]] merchants. Iranians had also begun to settle in the province, along with the [[Jat people|Zutt]], who had been deported from [[India]]. Other Indian groups such as the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] may also have been deported to Meshan, either as captives or recruited sailors.{{sfn|Christopher Brunner|1975|p=755}} In Asoristan the majority of the people were Aramaic-speaking Nestorian Christians while the Persians, Jews and Arabs formed a minority in the province.

Due to invasions from the [[Scythians]] and their sub-group, the [[Alans]], into Azerbaijan, Armenia, and other places in the Caucasus, the places gained a larger, although small, Iranian population.{{sfn|Christopher Brunner|1975|p=763}} Parthian, along with other Iranian dialects and languages was spoken in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], while to the further east in places which were not always controlled by the Sasanians, [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] and [[Khwarezmian language|Khwarazmian]] was spoken. To the further south in [[Sistan]], which saw an influx of [[Scythians]] during the Parthian period, [[Sistani dialect|Sistani]] was spoken.{{sfn|Christopher Brunner|1975|pp=772-773}}{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|p=101}} [[Kerman Province|Kirman]] was populated by an Iranian group which closely resembled the Persians, while, farther to the east in [[Paratan (satrapy)|Paratan]], [[Turan (satrapy)|Turan]] and [[Makran]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]] and non-Iranian languages were spoken.{{sfn|Christopher Brunner|1975|pp=772-773}} In major cities such as [[Gundeshapur]] and Ctesiphon, [[Latin]], Greek and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] were spoken by Roman/Byzantine prisoners of war.

==Legacy and importance==
The influence of the Sasanian Empire continued long after it fell. The empire, through the guidance of several able emperors prior to its fall, had achieved a [[Persian Culture|Persian renaissance]] that would become a driving force behind the [[Islamic world|civilization]] of the newly established religion of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Sasanian Iran, 224- 651 AD: portrait of a late antique empire - Page 20&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[Iran]] and the regions of the [[Greater Iran|Iranosphere]], the Sasanian period is regarded as one of the high points of [[History of Iran|Iranian civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;The Iranians: Persia, Islam and the soul of a nation - Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Europe===
[[File:Derbent summer.jpg|thumb|A Sasanian fortress in [[Derbent]], Russia (the [[Gates of Alexander|Caspian Gates]])]]

Sasanian culture and military structure had a significant influence on [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman civilization]]. The structure and character of the [[Roman army]] was affected by the methods of Persian warfare. In a modified form, the Roman Imperial autocracy imitated the royal ceremonies of the Sasanian court at Ctesiphon, and those in turn had an influence on the ceremonial traditions of the [[court]]s of medieval and modern Europe. The origin of the formalities of European diplomacy is attributed to the diplomatic relations between the Persian governments and the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bury|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Jewish history===
[[File:Persians (Parsees) in Bombay 1873.jpg|thumb|"Parsees of [[Bombay]]" a wood engraving, c. 1878]]

Important developments in [[Jewish history]] are associated with the Sassanian Empire. The Babylonian [[Talmud]] was composed between the third and sixth centuries in Sasanian Persia &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G-OYdFG8wswC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;dq=babylonian+talmud+composed+sassanid&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-F1-R3APUA&amp;sig=K2uhbuornm_8EHObzPqiK1DjHG4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCWoVChMIluHenY7yxgIVxxseCh1MXgos#v=onepage&amp;q=babylonian%20talmud%20composed%20sassanid&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and major Jewish academies of learning were established in [[Sura (city)|Sura]] and [[Pumbedita]] that became cornerstones of [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Jewish scholarship]].&lt;ref&gt;The fire, the star and the cross by Aptin Khanbaghi(2006) pg 6&lt;/ref&gt; Several individuals of the Imperial family such as Ifra Hormizd the Queen mother of Shapur II and Queen [[Shushandukht]], the Jewish wife of Yazdegerd I, significantly contributed to the close relations between the Jews of the empire and the government in Ctesiphon.&lt;ref&gt;A. Khanbaghi(2006) pg 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===In India===
{{See also|Zoroastrianism in India}}
The collapse of the Sasanian Empire led to Islam slowly replacing Zoroastrianism as the primary religion of Iran. A large number of Zoroastrians chose to emigrate to escape Islamic persecution. According to the ''[[Qissa-i Sanjan]]'', one group of those refugees landed in what is now [[Gujarat]], India, where they were allowed greater freedom to observe their old customs and to preserve their faith. The descendants of those Zoroastrians would play a small but significant role in the development of India. Today there are over 70,000 Zoroastrians in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parsi population in India declines  |url=http://www.payvand.com/news/04/sep/1055.html |date=September 7, 2004  |work=Payvand's Iran News&amp;nbsp;... |publisher=Payvand|accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zoroastrians still use a variant of the religious calendar instituted under the Sasanians. That calendar still marks the number of years since the accession of Yazdegerd III, just as it did in 632. (''See also: [[Zoroastrian calendar]]'')

{{Sex differences}}
'''Sex differences in crime''' are differences between [[men]] and [[women]] as the perpetrators or victims of [[crime]]. Such studies may belong to fields such as [[criminology]] (the scientific study of criminal behavior), [[sociobiology]] (which attempts to demonstrate a causal relationship between biological factors, in this case biological [[sex]] and human behaviors), or [[feminist studies]]. Despite the difficulty of interpreting them, [[crime statistics]] may provide a way to investigate such a relationship from a [[gender differences]] perspective. An observable difference in crime rates between men and women might be due to social and cultural factors, crimes going unreported, or to biological factors (for example, [[testosterone]] or sociobiological theories). Taking the nature of the crime itself into consideration may also be a factor.

Statistics have been consistent in reporting that men commit more criminal acts than women.&lt;ref name="Carrabine"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Eamonn Carrabine, Paul Iganski, Maggy Lee|title=Criminology: A Sociological Introduction|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=0415281679|year=2004|page=88|accessdate=August 7, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJm4AIc4sZEC&amp;pg=PA88|quote=Statistics repeatedly show that many more men than women commit crimes.

(1998) found that low levels of [[self control]] are associated with criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burton|first1=Velmer|last2=Cullen|first2=Francis|last3=Evans|first3=David|last4=Alarid|first4=Leanne Fiftal|last5=Dunaway|first5=R.

Some differing explanations include men's [[evolutionary]] tendency toward risk and violent behavior, sex differences in activity, [[social support]], or [[gender inequality]].

==General theory of crime==
Burton ''et al.'' (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Burton, V. S., Cullen, F. T., Evans, T. D., Alarid, L. F., Dunaway, R. G.|year=1998|title=Gender, self control, and crime|journal=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency|volume=35|issue=2|pages=123–147|url=http://troublesofyouth.pbworks.com/f/gender+self-control+and+crime.pdf|doi=10.1177/002242789803500200}}&lt;/ref&gt; assessed Gottfredson and Hirschi's (1990) "general theory of crime," which stated that individuals with lower levels of self-control are more likely to be involved in criminal behavior, in a gender-sensitive context.  The purpose of their study was to account for the gender gap in crime rates.  By using a self-reporting questionnaire, Burton ''et al.'' (1998) retrieved data from 555 people aged eighteen and older in the Cincinnati, Ohio, area.  Early results from the study indicated that low self-control was highly positively correlated to criminal behavior in both genders, but was especially significant for males.  For females, the relationship became significant when opportunity was introduced and considered with level of self-control.  Opportunity was not a significant indicator of male criminal behavior, which the authors attribute to the assumption that opportunity for criminal behavior is ubiquitous for men.  In this study, opportunity was measured by the number of nights per week individuals go out for recreation purposes.  Similarly, the authors conclude that women are less likely to be exposed to opportunities for criminal behavior, speculating that "constraints often placed on females, and that accompany their lifestyles" contribute to less opportunity for crime.  With self-control being significant for males but not for females, the conclusions of this study pointed toward the notion that men and women commit crimes for different reasons.  The notion that self-control was only significant for women when combined with opportunity helps account for the gender gap seen in crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen ''et al.'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Rowe, Alexander Vazsonyi, and Daniel Flannery, authors of ''Sex Differences in Crime: Do Means and Within-Sex Variation Have Similar Causes?'',&lt;ref name=Rowe/&gt; focus on the widely acknowledged fact that there is a large sex difference in crime: more men than women commit crimes.&lt;ref name="Carrabine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;  This fact has been true over time and across cultures.&lt;ref name="Carrabine"/&gt;  Also, there are a more equal{{Clarify|date=April 2017}} number of men that commit serious crimes resulting in injury or death than women.&lt;ref name="Rowe1"&gt;Rowe, Vazsonyi, &amp; Flannery, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In a study that looked at self-reports of delinquent acts, researchers identified several sex differences by looking at sex ratios.  For every woman, 1.28 men drink alcohol, which is a large influencer in deviant behavior.  For every woman, 2.7 men committed the crime of stealing up to $50. Lastly, for every woman, 3.7 men steal more than $50.  Also, more males are involved in homicides, as both the perpetrators and victims, than females.  Furthermore, one male is more delinquent than another for mainly the same reasons that men typically engage in criminal acts more than women.&lt;ref name="Rowe1"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; compare childhood risk factors of males and females portraying childhood-onset and adolescent-onset antisocial behavior, which influences deviant behavior in individuals. Childhood-onset delinquency is attributed to lack of parenting, neurocognitive problems, and temperament and behavior problems. On the other hand, adolescent-onset delinquents did not encounter similar childhood problems. This study showed a male-to-female ratio of 10:1 for those experiencing childhood-onset delinquency and 15:1 for adolescent-onset delinquency. Moffitt and Caspi hypothesized that "'life-course-persistent' antisocial behavior originates early in life, when the difficult behavior of a high-risk young child is exacerbated by a high-risk social environment".&lt;ref name="Moffitt &amp; Caspi, 2001"&gt;Moffitt &amp; Caspi, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, "'adolescent-limited' antisocial behavior emerges alongside puberty, where otherwise healthy youngsters experience dysphoria during the relatively role-less years between biological maturation and access to mature privileges and responsibilities", called the maturity gap.&lt;ref name="Moffitt &amp; Caspi, 2001"/&gt;  They look at the taxonomy theory, which states that the gender difference in crime are based on sex differences in the risk factors for life-course-persistent antisocial behavior.  Based on research, girls are less likely than boys to have nervous system dysfunctions, difficult temperament, late maturity in verbal and motor development, learning disabilities, and childhood behavioral problems.&lt;ref name="Moffitt &amp; Caspi, 2001"/&gt;

=== Sociology ===
{{Further information|Feminist school of criminology#Gender ratio}}

Considerations of gender in regard to crime have been considered to be largely ignored and pushed aside in criminological and sociological study, until recent years, to the extent of female deviance having been marginalized.&lt;ref name="Heidensohn, 1995"&gt;(Heidensohn, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; In the past fifty years of sociological research into crime and deviance, sex differences were understood and quite often mentioned within works, such as Merton's theory of anomie; however, they were not critically discussed, and often any mention of female delinquency was only as comparative to males, to explain male behaviors, or through defining the girl as taking on the role of a boy, namely, conducting their behavior and appearance as that of a [[tomboy]] and by rejecting the female [[gender role]], adopting stereotypical masculine traits.

Eagly and Steffen suggested in their meta-analysis of data on sex and aggression that beliefs about the negative consequences of violating gender expectations affect how both genders behave regarding aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.100.3.309 |title=Gender and aggressive behavior: A meta-analytic review of the social psychological literature |year=1986 |last1=Eagly |first1=Alice H. |last2=Steffen |first2=Valerie J. |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=309–30 |pmid=3797558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Anne Campbell argued that "cultural interpretations have 'enhanced' evolutionarily based sex differences by a process of imposition which stigmatises the expression of aggression by females and causes women to offer exculpatory (rather than justificatory) accounts of their own aggression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0140525X99001818 |title=Staying alive: Evolution, culture, and women's intrasexual aggression |year=1999 |last1=Campbell |first1=Anne |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=22 |issue=2 |pmid=11301523 |pages=203–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One key reason contended for this lack of attention to females in crime and deviance is due to the view that female crime has almost exclusively been dealt with by men, from policing through to legislators, and that this has continued through into the theoretical approaches, quite often portraying what could be considered as a one-sided view, as Mannheim suggested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/28/2/93.pdf Feminism and Criminology In Britain] (Heidensohn, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other contentions have been made as explanations for the invisibility of women in regard to theoretical approaches, such as: females have an '...apparently low level of offending'); that they pose less of a social threat than their male counterparts; that their 'delinquencies tend to be of a relatively minor kind', but also due to the fear that including women in research could threaten or undermine theories, as Thrasher and Sutherland feared would happen with their research.&lt;ref name="Heidensohn, 1995"/&gt;

Further theories have been contended, with many debates surrounding the involvement and ignoring of women within theoretical studies of crime; however, with new approaches and advances in feminist studies and masculinity studies, and the claims of increases in recent years in female crime, especially that of violent crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacro.org.uk/data/resources/nacro-2004120227.pdf Girls In The Youth Justice System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002173131/http://www.nacro.org.uk/data/resources/nacro-2004120227.pdf |date=2008-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociobiological and evolutionary psychology perspective ===
{{Further information|Sociobiology|Sociobiological theories of rape}}
[[Evolutionary psychology]] has proposed several evolutionary explanations for gender differences in [[aggressiveness]]. Males can increase their reproductive success by [[polygyny]] which will lead the competition with other males over females. If the mother died, this may have had more serious consequences for a child than if the father died in the ancestral environment since there is a tendency for greater [[parental investment]]s and caring for children by females than by males{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. Greater caring for children also leads to difficulty leaving them in order to either fight or flee. Anne Campbell writes that females may thus avoid direct physical aggressiveness and instead use strategies such as "friendship termination, gossiping, ostracism, and stigmatization".&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2005. Chapter 21 by Anne Campbell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist and professor [[Mark van Vugt]], from [[VU University Amsterdam|VU University]] at [[Amsterdam]], Netherlands, has argued that males have evolved more aggressive and group-oriented in order to gain access to resources, territories, mates and higher status.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.professormarkvanvugt.com/images/files/malewarrior.pdf|title = Gender Differences in Cooperation and Competition:The Male-Warrior Hypothesis|last = Vugt|first = Mark Van|date = 2006|journal = Psychological Science|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01842.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evolution and the psychology of intergroup conflict: the male warrior hypothesis|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date = 2012-03-05|issn = 0962-8436|pmc = 3260849|pmid = 22271783|pages = 670–679|volume = 367|issue = 1589|doi = 10.1098/rstb.2011.0301|first = Melissa M.|last = McDonald|first2 = Carlos David|last2 = Navarrete|first3 = Mark|last3 = Van Vugt}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory the [[Male Warrior hypothesis]] explains that males throughout hominid history have evolved to form coalitions or groups in order to engage in inter-group aggression and increase their chances of acquiring resources, mates and territory.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Vugt argues that this evolved male social dynamic explains the human history of war to modern day gang rivalry which is under a process of male on male competition in order to gain resources and potential mates.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are two theories on the role of [[testosterone]] in aggression and competition among males.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Archer J|title = Testosterone and human aggression: an evaluation of the challenge hypothesis|journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|volume = 30|issue = 3|pages = 319–45|date = 2006|pmid = 16483890|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2004.12.007|url = http://www.homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/faculty/josephs/pdf_documents/Arch_Chall_NBR.pdf|access-date = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160109111144/http://www.homepage.psy.utexas.edu/HomePage/faculty/josephs/pdf_documents/Arch_Chall_NBR.pdf|archivedate = 2016-01-09|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first one is the [[Challenge hypothesis]] which states that testosterone would increase during puberty thus facilitating reproductive and competitive behaviour which would include aggression as a result of evolution.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Thus it is the challenge of competition in relation to testosterone among males of the species that facilitates aggression and violence.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Studies conducted have found direct correlation between testosterone and dominance especially among the most violent criminals in prison who had the highest testosterone levels.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; The same research also found fathers (those outside competitive environments) had the lowest testosterone levels compared to other males.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; The second theory is also similar and is known as the evolutionary neuroandrogenic (ENA) theory of male aggression.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|title = The evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory of criminal behavior expanded|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276151720_The_evolutionary_neuroandrogenic_theory_of_criminal_behavior_expanded|journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior|pages = 61–74|volume = 24|doi = 10.1016/j.avb.2015.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fetal testosterone and criminality: test of evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270007761_Fetal_testosterone_and_criminality_Test_of_evolutionary_neuroandrogenic_theory|journal = Criminology|pages = 54–73|volume = 53|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/1745-9125.12056|first = Anthony W.|last = Hoskin|first2 = Lee|last2 = Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testosterone and other androgens have evolved to masculinize a brain in order to be competitive even as far as being a risk to harming others. By doing so, individuals with masculinized brains as a result of pre-natal and adult life testosterone and androgens enhance their resource acquiring abilities in order to survive, attract and copulate with mates as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory of criminal behavior expanded|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276151720_The_evolutionary_neuroandrogenic_theory_of_criminal_behavior_expanded|journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior|pages = 61–74|volume = 24|doi = 10.1016/j.avb.2015.05.002|first = Lee|last = Ellis|first2 = Anthony W.|last2 = Hoskin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, crime can be seen as an extreme form of adaptation to gain status and acquire more resources. Many other researchers have agreed with this and have stated that criminal behavior is an expression of inter-male competition in mating efforts and resource seeking since there is a huge correlation between criminals and fathering children at younger ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evolutionary theory and criminal behaviour|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227618563_Evolutionary_theory_and_criminal_behaviour|journal = Legal and Criminological Psychology|pages = 1–13|volume = 7|issue = 1|doi = 10.1348/135532502168324|first = Vernon L.|last = Quinsey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aggression and violence among peers and in relationships ==
{{Further information|Sex differences in psychology#Aggression|Aggression#Gender }}
Women are more likely to use direct aggression in private, where other people cannot see them, and are more likely to use indirect aggression (such as [[passive-aggressive]] behavior) in public.&lt;ref name=Chrisler&gt;{{Cite book |last = Chrisler |first = Joan C|title = Handbook of Gender Research in Psychology|publisher = Springer, 2010|isbn = 9781441914644|author2=Donald R. McCreary }}{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men are more likely to be the targets of displays of aggression and provocation than women. Studies by Bettencourt and Miller show that when provocation is controlled for, sex differences in aggression are greatly reduced.

One study argued that it was the above-cited Dekeseredy et al. that in fact improperly contextualized partner violence; Dekeseredy's campus study was based around asking women and only women if their violence was in [[self-defense]], and not permitting the same for men. This results in counting men who had defended themselves as perpetrators, and counting women who may have engaged in ex post facto justification of their violence, a noted trait of [[psychological abuse]], as victims.&lt;ref name="pubpages.unh.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V74-gender-symmetry-with-gramham-Kevan-Method%208-.pdf|title=Processes Explaining the Concealment and Distortion of Evidence on Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence|author=Straus, M.|doi=10.100715/J061/0-007-9060-5|journal=Eur J Crim Policy Res|year=2007|volume=13|pages=227–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study further found that studies from the US [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] did not contextualize violence simply by not counting women perpetrators until forced to by the US [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC). Other studies that decontextualized partner violence included labeling aggregate findings of motivations for violence that included the desire to coerce or control the partner or being angry with the partner as "striking back" when such questions revealed that women scored equal to or higher than men in desires to use violence out of simple anger or to coerce and control the partner.&lt;ref name="pubpages.unh.edu"/&gt; This, however, is contradicted by other reviews which found women's primary motivation were triggered by anger or self-defense while men's motivation was more about control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why do women use intimate partner violence?

Another large study reveals that women are between two and three times as likely to be the offender in non-reciprocal partner violence. The study suggests that while women are far more prone to be the sole offender, reciprocal violence where both partners use violence has higher frequency of serious injuries, and that these injuries more often have female victims than male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Differences in frequency of violence and reported injury between relationships with reciprocal and nonreciprocal intimate partner violence|authors=Whitaker DJ, Haileyesus T, Swahn M, Saltzman LS.

==Court system==
One study has noted substantial differences in the treatment and behavior of defendants in the courts on the basis of gender; female criminologist Frances Heidensohn postulates that for judges and juries it is often "impossible to isolate the circumstances that the defendant is a woman from the circumstances that she can also be a widow, a mother, attractive, or may cry on the stand."&lt;ref name="Heidensohn 1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heidensohn|first=Frances|title=Women and Crime|year=1986|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, male and female defendants in court have reported being advised to conduct themselves differently in accordance with their gender; women in particular recall being advised to express "mute passivity," whereas men are encouraged to "assert themselves" in cross-examinations and testimony.&lt;ref name="Heidensohn 1986"/&gt;

According to a [[Canadian Public Health Agency]] report, the rate of violent crime doubled among male youth during the late 1980s and 1990s, while it almost tripled among female youth. It rose for the latter from 2.2 per 1,000 in 1988 to a peak of 5.6 per 1,000 in 1996, and began to decline in 1999. Some researchers have suggested that the increase on crime statistics could be partly explained by the stricter approach to schoolyard fights and [[bullying]], leading to a criminalization of behaviors now defined as "assault" behaviors (while they were simply negatively perceived before). The increase in the proportion of female violent crime would thus be explained more by a change in law enforcement policies than by effective behavior of the population itself. According to the report aforementioned, "Evidence suggests that aggressive and violent behavior in children is linked to family and social factors, such as social and financial deprivation; harsh and inconsistent parenting; parents' marital problems; family violence, whether between parents, by parents toward children or between siblings; poor parental mental health; physical and sexual abuse; and alcoholism, drug dependency or other substance misuse by parents or other family members."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ncfv-cnivf/familyviolence/html/nfntsaggsr_e.html Aggressive Girls], [[Public Health Agency of Canada]], last updated 10 June 2006, URL accessed on April 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In two, the ratio was 50:50 ([[Switzerland]] and [[British Virgin Islands]]), and in the remaining 7; [[Tonga]], [[Iceland]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Republic of Korea]], [[Latvia]] and [[Hong Kong]], females were more likely to be victims of homicides compared to males.&lt;ref name="UNDOC1"&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/data.html UNDOC Homicide Statistics 2013] used tables: [http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/data/GSH2013_Homicide_count_and_rate.xlsx Homicide counts and rates] &amp; [http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/data/GSH2013_Sex_data.xlsx Percentage of male and female homicide victims] Retrieved May-31-2014&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 global study on homicide by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime found that males accounted for about 96 percent of all homicide perpetrators worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf|title = Global Study on Homicide|date = 2013|accessdate = |website = www.unodc.org|publisher = United National Office of Drugs and Crime (Vienna)|last = Gibbons|first = Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the percent of victims killed by their spouses or ex-spouses in 2011 were 77.4 percent women and 22.6 percent men in selected countries across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.unodc.org/documents/congress/background-information/Crime_Statistics/Global_Study_on_Homicide_2011.pdf|title = Global study on homicide|date = 2011|accessdate = |website = www.unodc.org|publisher = United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (Vienna)|last = Gibbons|first = Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Simeulue people''' (other names include '''Simalur''', '''Simeuloë''', '''Simulul''', '''Long Bano''' and '''Devayan''') are an [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] group of people inhabiting [[Simeulue Island]] off the west coast of [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/smr |title=Simeulue |publisher=Ethnologue |accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are mostly found in [[Teupah Barat]], [[Simeulue Timur]], [[Simeulue Tengah]], [[Teupah Selatan]] and [[Teluk Dalam, Aceh|Teluk Dalam]] districts. The Simeulue people speak [[Simeulue language|Simeulue]], a [[Northwest Sumatran languages|Northwest Sumatran]] language closely related to [[Sikule language|Sikule]] (which is also spoken in Simeulue island) and [[Nias language|Nias]] (spoken in neighbouring [[Nias|Nias island]]. The language also has a strong [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arndt Graf |author2=Susanne Schroter |author3=Edwin Wieringa |title=Aceh: History, Politics and Culture, Volume 9|year=2010|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian|isbn=981-4279-12-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Simeulue people became more widely known worldwide after the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] because of their high survival rate. Their survival was credited to their tradition of oral history. A previous tsunami in 1908 had affected the island, and stories told about it served as disaster preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878029614000711 |title=Recognizing Indigenous Knowledge for Disaster Management: Smong, Early Warning System from Simeulue Island, Aceh |author=Syafwina |year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.proenv.2014.03.070|accessdate=2015-01-09 |volume=20 |journal=Procedia Environmental Sciences |pages=573–582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 7 people put of the then 78,000 total population died in the December 26, 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ashbindu Singh |author2=Zinta Zommers |title=Reducing Disaster: Early Warning Systems for Climate Change|year=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=94-017-8598-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002193085_tsunami01.html |title=Islanders remembered stories of 1907 tsunami

SGR was developed in the Arup Hong Kong office and is derived from design practice, observations and collective research on [[East Asia]]’s energetic [[Urbanization|urbanisation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research - China’s Rapid Urbanization: Benefits, Challenges &amp; Strategies|url = http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/0,,contentMDK:21812803~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:469382,00.html|website = econ.worldbank.org|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now regarded as a key component of Hong Kong's city strategy.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hk2030plus.hk/document/2030+_Pamphlet_English.pdf|title=Public Engagement Pamphlet for Hong Kong's 2030+ planning vision and strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SGR planning approach is based on observations of East Asia’s rapid urbanisation processes that have left many cities and landscapes in the region vulnerable to climate change, environmental degradation and socioeconomic fluctuations. The approach espouses the holistic resolution of critical issues pertinent to contemporary cities with an equal focus on the organization of urban systems and their management as well as physical design (including infrastructure and buildings.)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Smart Green Resilient|author1=Lau, Wilfred |author2=Romanos, Christoforos |author3=Chong, Bruce |publisher = Arup|year = 2015|isbn = 9789881492302|location = Hong Kong|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to recent public discussions on the merits of SGR,&lt;ref&gt;''YEUNG, Theresa''. Presentation entitled “From “Smart” to “Smart-Green-Resilient” Planning / 從“智能”到“智能-綠色-韌性” 規劃”, [http://www.apacinnosummit.net/programme-rundown?l=en-us&amp;id=7 APAC Innovation Summit 2015], Hong Kong. 23 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lau, Wilfred''. Presentation entitled “A Smart Green Resilient Aerotropolis”, International Summit Conference on the Development of Aerotropolis, Taipei, Taiwan, April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; the combined use of the terms “[[Smart city|smart]]”, “[[Green cities|green]]” and “[[Climate resilience|resilient]]” is derived from the proliferation of similar terminologies in current urban practice aiming to guide the transformation of urban environments into “Smart Cities”, “Resilient Cities” or combinations thereof. However, SGR does not aim to replace other planning approaches but instead is considered necessary to coordinate the often multidisciplinary nature of collaborative city-building and to maximize benefits to urban residents, businesses and governments.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''Lau, Wilfred;'' Lecture entitled [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETBvwCGTJ9s “Towards Smart Green Resilient Cities”] (See the link for the video clip of presentation on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETBvwCGTJ9s Youtube] or from Arup's official [http://video.arup.com/?v=1_lgoyzv4z website for full version]), Hong Kong Polytechnic University, October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arup {{!}} Thoughts {{!}} Urban planning needs a new direction, January 2016|url = http://thoughts.arup.com/post/details/518/urban-planning-needs-a-new-direction|website = thoughts.arup.com|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The key ideas behind SGR were initially conceived in 2008 and formally consolidated in January 2014. The phrase “Smart Green Resilient” (or “SGR”) first appears in this form to describe the holistic planning approach employed to advise the government of Taoyuan on the strategic master plan for North Taiwan’s Taoyuan Aerotropolis.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Event Reports - EUROPEAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TAIWAN - Friday, 18 October 2013|url = http://www.ecct.com.tw/events_reportdetail.aspx?pcseq=4&amp;cseq=70&amp;seq=971|website = www.ecct.com.tw|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Intelligent Community Forum (ICF)|url = https://www.intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?src=gendocs&amp;ref=BrainGain_Sponsors&amp;link=BrainGain_Sponsors|website = www.intelligentcommunity.org|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 航空城吸引港議員率企業來台　聚焦綠建築智慧城投資商機 -  - 華視新聞網; 22 October 2014|url = http://news.cts.com.tw/nownews/society/201410/201410221523786.html#.VbmhMvmqpBc|website = 華視新聞網|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then SGR has been the subject of lectures, presentations and research papers outlining the concerns as well as the solutions and direction that urban planning should adopt.&lt;ref&gt;''Chong, Bruce et al.'' “From Smart to Smart-Green-Resilient City planning” (從“智慧”到“智慧-綠色-韌性), Annual China Urban Planning Conference, Hai Kou, Hainan, 2014, ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.planning.org.cn/thesis/view?id=7697&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in 2015, the book entitled Smart Green Resilient, traces the development of the concept since 2008 beginning with the Ninh Thuan Integrated Development Plan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.arup.com/Projects/Ninh_Thuan.aspx|title = Ninh Thuan Integrated Development Plan|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed by the planning study for Hong Kong’s Lok Ma Chau Loop&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.news.gov.hk/en/categories/infrastructure/html/2013/07/20130718_195352.shtml|title = Lok Ma Chau Loop|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on smart city and sustainable development principles. The book summarises the growth of environmental awareness and the different ways cities and planners have responded to these escalating challenges over the recent past. The book also outlines some of the main elements that characterise the SGR approach, various applications in project work and sources of inspiration from global geographies.

As of 2016-2017, the phrase “Smart Green and Resilient” has been adopted by Hong Kong’s Planning Department and Development Bureau to describe the 2030+ planning vision for the city.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hk2030plus.hk/document/Hong%20Kong%202030+%20A%20SGR%20City%20Strategy_Eng.pdf|title=Hong Kong 2030+: A Smart, Green and Resilient City Strategy, October 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=http://www.hk2030plus.hk/explore.asp?form=31|publisher=Hong Kong Planning Department|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Reference to Smart Green Resilient is also made in relation to the New Territories North development in Hong Kong, where the approach is intended to enable "a low-carbon environment equipped with smart city infrastructure and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/community/article/2134514/350000-people-could-live-one-hong-kongs-last-untouched|title=Up to 350,000 people could live in one of Hong Kong’s last untouched areas, study finds|last=Ng|first=Naomi|date=24 February 2018|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=26 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

== Themes ==
The SGR planning approach is characterized by various themes that range from identification of critical urban issues to their collaborative resolution, usually by large multidisciplinary groups that can include engineers, residents, economists, city administrators, environmentalists etc.

=== Current Planning Solutions ===
A key thesis of SGR involves the limitations inherent in current planning approaches including Smart City, Resilient City, Ubiquitous City, Wise City etc. While there are merits in each of these directions, none of them present a holistic design system that takes into consideration the complexity of urban networks and their social, economic and cultural dimensions. This lays the groundwork for an alternative approach to urban planning that can shed light into wider issues and incorporate comprehensive solutions that are intended to multiply the benefits for city residents. In the SGR approach for example, the term “resilience” is not limited to climate adaptation but equally embraces the adaptability of physical infrastructure as well as economic and social resilience.

=== Cognitive Prism ===
SGR is not intended to present a prescriptive methodology for urban planning. In contrast to many urban planning approaches, SGR seeks to reveal the relationships between critical issues by interrogating already identified concerns through different lenses. As such SGR is described as a “cognitive prism” through which “urban planners can gain a holistic view of the challenges they need to address.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Three Elements of SGR&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ===
Three important elements characterize the SGR planning approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''People Oriented''' that advocates designing for end users, the need to broaden stakeholder engagement, formulate broad alliances with concerned parties and realize community benefits;
* '''Contemporary Relevance''' espousing the importance of addressing current issues through the use of a composite systems approach that can lay the foundation for a structured long-term implementation as well as revealing territorial relationships;
* '''Future Proofing''' that supports capacity-building, the utilization of appropriate technology and scenario-testing to secure plans have adequate built-in flexibility to adapt under various conditions.

== See also ==
Over the recent past, researchers, industrial practitioners, bloggers, and interested groups have also promulgated their thoughts around concepts that utilize the terms “smart”, “green” and “resilient” by combining “S”, “G” and “R” into “SG”, “SR” or GR”. It should be noted that these do not form part of the SGR planning approach.

'''Sociology of terrorism''' is an emerging field in [[sociology]] seeking to understand [[terrorism]] as a [[social phenomenon]] and how individuals as well as [[State (polity)|states]] respond to such events. It is not to be confused with [[critical terrorism studies]] which sometimes overlaps with the [[psychology of terrorism]].

==History==

===Pre-September 11 attacks===
After the [[September 11 attacks]], there has been a spike of interest in various sociological traditions related to terrorism, such as [[moral panic]], organizational response and media coverage, and [[counter-terrorism]].

The most comprehensive study into the definition of terrorism comes from a study by Weinberg, Pedahzur and Hirsch-Hoefler (2004) who examined 73 definitions of terrorism from 55 articles and concluded that terrorism is: "a politically motivated tactic involving the threat or use of force or violence in which the pursuit of publicity plays a significant role."&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Pedahzur and Hirsch-Hoefler 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, Weinberg ''et al.'' point out that definitions of terrorism often ignore [[Symbolism of terrorism|symbolic aspects of terrorism]].  Due to its focus on symbolism, sociology has a unique vantage point from which to assess [[Fear|terror]].

===Post-September 11 attacks===
Since the September 11 attacks, Mathieu Deflem ([[University of South Carolina]]), S.E. Costanza ([[Central Connecticut State University]]) and John C. Kilburn Jr. ([[Texas A&amp;M International University]]) are among the sociologists to call for the development of a sub-field in sociology related to terrorism. Common topics that are part of the discourse in the sociology of terrorism include: [[military spending]], counter-terrorism, [[immigration]], privacy issues, and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], where within these contexts questions of power, the definition of terrorism, propaganda, nationality, the media, etc. are being deliberated upon.

Early peer-reviewed literature after the September 11 attacks examined policing and citizen responses to terror during the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2002&lt;/ref&gt; It also examined interactions between [[first responder]]s (police, rescue teams, etc.) and communities. Ramirez, Hoopes and Quinlan (2003) rightly predicted that police organizations would change fundamental styles of [[Racial profiling|profiling]] people&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, Hoopes and Quinlan 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and police agencies would alter their [[mission statement]]s after the September 11 attacks. There is strong reason to believe that even the smallest of local police agencies are apt to feel some kind of pressure to deal with the issue of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;DeLone 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent work in the sociology of terrorism field is philosophical and reflective and has focused on issues such as moral panic and over-spending after the September 11 attacks. Costanza and Kilburn (2005), in an article entitled ''Symbolic Security, Moral Panic and Public Sentiment: Toward a sociology of Counterterrorism'' argued that the issue of symbolism is of much importance to understanding the war on terror.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza and Kilburn 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Using a classic [[symbolic interactionist]] perspective, they argue that strong public sentiment about the [[homeland security]] issue has driven policy more to superficial threats than real and concrete threats. Others argue that symbolism has led to agency a policy of “[[hypervigilance]]” in agency decision-making that is costly and [[Falsifiability|untestable]].

Some sociologists and legal scholars have contemplated the potential consequences of aggressive (or [[militaristic]]) policing of terror threats that may have negative implications for human rights which are of great interest to sociologists as a matter of [[social justice]].  For instance, in a peer-reviewed article ''Crouching tiger or phantom dragon? Examining the discourse on global cyber-terror'', Helms, Costanza and Johnson (2011) ask if it is possible that media hype at the national level could prompt an unnecessary and systemic over-pursuit of [[cyberterrorism]]. They warn that such overreaction might lead to a "[[killswitch]]" policy which could give the federal government ultimate power over the internet.

Despite the [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] lean of modern sociology; Kilburn, Costanza, Borgeson and Metchik (2011) point out that there are several methodological barbs to effectively and scientifically assessing the effect of homeland security measures.&lt;ref&gt;Kilburn, Costanza, Borgeson and Metchik 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In traditional [[criminology]], the most quantitatively amenable starting point for measuring the effectiveness of any policing strategy (i.e., [[Neighborhood Watch|neighborhood watch]], [[gun control]], foot patrols, etc.) is to assess total financial costs against [[clearance rates]] or [[arrest rates]]. Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena, measuring arrests would be a naive way to test policy effectiveness.

Another methodological problem in the development of sociology of terrorism as a sub-field is one of finding operational measures for key concepts in the study of homeland security.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg et al 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Both terrorism and homeland security are relatively new concepts for social scientists, and academicians have yet to agree on the matter of how to properly conceptualize these ideas.

==Three sociological perspectives==

===Structural functionalism===
{{Main|Structural functionalism}}
Functionalism is “the theory that various social institutions and processes in society exists to serve some important (or necessary) function to keep society running.” This sociological perspective draws on the work of sociologists like [[Émile Durkheim]], and gets its name from the idea that the best way to study society is to identify the [[Role|roles]] that different aspects of society play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=29|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deviance (sociology)|Social deviance]], loosely understood, can be taken to mean any "transgression of socially established [[Social norm|norms]]." This can range from the minor–slamming a door in someone's face–to the major–a terrorist act. Thus terrorism is a deviant behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=189|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Functionalism sees terrorism–which is a form of [[crime]]–as a temporary deviation from the normal goings on of society, and is in a way functional to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and  Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sociologist that utilizes structural functionalism would explain the existence of any social phenomena by the function they perform. Therefore, terrorism is functional because it joins individuals together in opposition, and brings a sense of belonging to the group opposing it. This feeling of [[group solidarity]] would help prevent [[Anomie|''anomie'']], which is the stage where people do not need to follow any norms of society in order to survive in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorists, like other criminals, become what is known as a reference point; individuals use a reference point as a standard for evaluation. The norms and rules of society become clearer, and are seen as necessary, in comparison to terrorism. In order to protect the [[Status quo|''status quo'']], society uses terrorism as a way to reassert the importance of social norms in the lives of individuals. Thus individuals see terrorism as a threat to the [[social equilibrium]] and their life in a functioning society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functionalists believe that social change is required to keep a healthy society. Slow, well-planned, and evolutionary method-types change a healthy society socially. These social changes often come about from a drastic need for change and are preceded by a social shock.  Terrorism brings about a social shock that moves society towards a change in direction that enables it to find new ways in which to protect itself. Functionalists view these new changes as providing society with a healthy and slow-paced [[social change]] that was needed. Terrorism thus becomes an expected and needed shock, and therefore can be seen in a sense to encourage society to change for the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict theory===
{{Main|Conflict theories}}
Conflict theory is “the idea that conflict between competing interests is the basic, animating force of social change and society in general." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=30|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conflict theorist generally sees that the control of conflict equals the ability of one group to suppress the group that they are opposing, and that [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] is a technique of defining and maintaining a social order that benefits some at the expense of others.

Conflict theorists view terrorism as a reaction to [[injustice]], which is probably created in the minds of terrorists due to misguidance, illiteracy, or unrealistic goals, and that violent behaviors expressed by terrorist organizations are the result of individual frustration, aggression or showing a readiness to fight. [[Political conflict]] makes people look for ways to explain and solve the problems they are facing. If the conflict is deeply rooted, and the current ideology proves unable to deal with the problems, people begin to turn to other ideologies that can often carry a religious theme to them. This is not to say that all forms of terrorist acts are committed by people that are religious. In 83% of the [[Suicide attack|suicide attackers]] worldwide, between 1980 and 2003, only 43% were identifiably religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Douglas|last2=Uggen|first2=Christopher|title=The Contexts Reader|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brym|first1=Robert|title=Six Lessons of Suicide Bombers|date=2007|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorists use violence because they believe that if they did not use violence they would lose a power struggle, which lead many conflict theorists to view it as a weapon of the weak. In [[Iraq]], between March 2003 and February 2006, 443 suicide missions took place with 71% belonging to [[al-Qaeda]]. They justified their actions in religious terms; viewing the [[Shia Islam in Iraq|Shi'a control of Iraq]] as abandoning religious principles. Suicide attacks against the Iraqi regime and its American and British supporters were seen as the means in which to accomplish this. Yet it was only under certain political conditions that suicide bombings spiked. The first condition being that it was in relation with the [[Counter-insurgency|counterinsurgency]] of the American and British militaries. The second being a strategic response to the [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] control becoming more stabilized in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Douglas|last2=Uggen|first2=Christopher|title=The Contexts Reader|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brym|first1=Robert|title=Six Lessons of Suicide Bombers|date=2007|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorists do not have the money or the political power that is needed to wage war, so they use terrorism as a means, not a goal, to agitate the government in order to achieve their political objectives.  Before committing an act of terror, a terrorist does not always weigh the cost and benefits of their actions, but rather is reacting from the humiliation and frustration they feel they are being subjected too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Douglas|last2=Uggen|first2=Christopher|title=The Contexts Reader|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brym|first1=Robert|title=Six Lessons of Suicide Bombers|date=2007|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolic interactionism===
{{Main|Symbolic interactionism}}
Symbolic interactionism is “a [[Microsociology|micro-level theory]] in which shared meanings, originations, and assumptions form the basic motivations behind peoples’ actions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=31|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In symbolic interactionism, [[face-to-face interaction]] creates the social world. Individuals act on perceived meanings that appear to be self-constituting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=32|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group membership is one of the major determinations if individual interpretations of reality, which enables symbolic interactionism to explain crime, and thus terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deviance, which terrorism falls under, can be explained by [[labeling theory]]. Labeling theory is “the belief that individuals subconsciously notice how others see or label them, and their reactions to those labels, over time, form the basis of their [[Self-concept|self-identity]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=206|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social groups]] create rules about what is acceptable behavior for people in society. When a rule is broken, society determines if the act was deviant. A person can only become deviant after a social reaction to an act committed is labeled deviant, and that original act is referred to as the [[primary deviance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=209|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being labeled deviant causes a person to see themselves as deviants, which leads to said person performing more deviant acts, with each act being referred to as [[secondary deviance]]. Secondary deviance can quickly turn into a [[Social stigma|stigma]], which is a label that changes the way people see someone, and how individuals view themselves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=2011|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to symbolic interactionism, terrorism is treated as learned behaviors. Each person learns how to commit terrorism through interactions with terrorists. Involvement in the group is important in the learning process, and members, upon joining, are resocialized to the group’s version of [[Social reality|reality]]. The best way to accomplish this is to involve new members in terrorist acts, which leads the terrorist organization to become the only reference point for its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and  Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social learning theory plays a part in the [[socialization]] of terroristic behaviors. Learning theory states that a person becomes deviant because of an abundance of definitions that favor deviant behavior versus definitions that are unfavorable to such behaviors. This theory is broken down into four learning mechanisms: differential association, definitions, differential reinforcement, and imitation.

The first learning mechanism is [[differential association]], which refers to "direct association and interaction with others who engage in certain kinds of behaviors or express norms, values, and attitudes supportive of such behavior, as well as indirect association and identification with more distant reference groups." The groups that an individual are differentially associated with provides the context in which the social learning is operated. The greater the priority, intensity, duration, and frequency of the differential association the greater the effect on behavior. Hence, the theory in relation to terrorism is that the stronger someone's connection is towards a terrorist organization the better chance that person has of also exhibiting terroristic behaviors.

The second learning mechanism is definitions. Definitions refer to an "individual's own value and belief system about what is and is not acceptable behavior." These values are learned and reinforced through differential association. There are two types of definitions, general definition and specific definition. General definitions include broad beliefs about conformity that are influenced through conventional means and are often influenced by religious or moral values. Specific definitions are seen as those that align an individual with particular acts of crime. The greater the number of definitions the more likely a person will engage in criminal behavior. So the more definitions an individual has that favor terroristic behavior the greater chance that person has of committing a terroristic acts.

The third learning mechanism is [[differential reinforcement]]. Differential reinforcement "refers to the balance of anticipated or actual rewards and punishments that follow behavior." An individual refraining from committing a crime depends on a balance of past, present, and anticipated future rewards or punishments for their actions. In regards to terrorism, the more direct or indirect social interaction a person has towards terrorism the more likely they are to commit a terroristic act.

The fourth and final learning mechanism is [[imitation]]. "Imitation is the notion that individuals engage in behaviors that they have previously witnessed others doing." The characters being observed, the behaviors that are being witnessed, and the consequences for those behaviors determine how much an individual imitates a behavior. All of these things need to fall into place in order for an individual to imitate a terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pauwels|first1=Lieven|last2=Schils|first2=Nele|title=Differential Online Exposure to Extremist Content and Political Violence: Testing the Relative Strength of Social Learning and Competing Perspectives|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|volume=28|pages=1|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09546553.2013.876414|doi=10.1080/09546553.2013.876414|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''South African Australians''' are citizens of [[Australia]] who are of [[South Africa]]n descent.

According to the 2006 Australian census 104,128 Australians were born in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="ABS Country of Birth"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?action=404&amp;documentproductno=0&amp;documenttype=Details&amp;order=1&amp;tabname=Details&amp;areacode=0&amp;issue=2006&amp;producttype=Census%20Tables&amp;javascript=true&amp;textversion=false&amp;navmapdisplayed=true&amp;breadcrumb=POLTD&amp;&amp;collection=Census&amp;period=2006&amp;productlabel=Country%20of%20Birth%20of%20Person%20(full%20classification%20list)%20by%20Sex&amp;producttype=Census%20Tables&amp;method=Place%20of%20Usual%20Residence&amp;topic=Birthplace&amp; |title = 20680-Country of Birth of Person (full classification list) by Sex - Australia|format = Microsoft Excel download |publisher = [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] | work = {{CensusAU|2006}}| accessdate = 2008-06-03}} Total count of persons: 19,855,288.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the Census 79,513 residents claimed South African ancestry, either alone or with another ancestry.&lt;ref name="ABS Ancestry"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?breadcrumb=POLTD&amp;method=Place%20of%20Usual%20Residence&amp;subaction=-1&amp;issue=2006&amp;producttype=Census%20Tables&amp;documentproductno=0&amp;textversion=false&amp;documenttype=Details&amp;collection=Census&amp;javascript=true&amp;topic=Ancestry&amp;action=404&amp;productlabel=Ancestry%20(full%20classification%20list)%20by%20Sex&amp;order=1&amp;period=2006&amp;tabname=Details&amp;areacode=0&amp;navmapdisplayed=true&amp; | title = 20680-Ancestry (full classification list) by Sex - Australia| format = Microsoft Excel download |publisher = [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] | work = {{CensusAU|2006}}| accessdate = 2008-06-02}} Total responses: 25,451,383 for total count of persons: 19,855,288.&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration from South Africa to Australia, particularly by professionals, accelerated in the 1990s. The large majority of South African immigrants to Australia have been of British descent; only a very small percentage, around 2-3% have been of Afrikaans origin.

More than half of the South African Australians arrived following the election of [[Nelson Mandela]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/the-african-migrants-who-fear-a-lower-standard-of-living-inaustralia/2008/06/06/1212259114357.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 ''The African migrants who fear a lower standard of living'' Sydney Morning Herald]&lt;/ref&gt; A behaviour stigmatised by [[white South African]]s who remained in their homeland as "Packing for Perth". "Packing for Perth" (and the initials "PFP") was also a humorous dig and reference to supporters of the "Progressive Federal Party" - a political party formed in 1977 that drew support mainly from liberal English-speaking white people, typically, the very people who ended up immigrating.

Each month, thousands of subscribers received a small blue box about the size of a [[VHS|videocasette]] containing some material such as nylon thread or dinosaur bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/djreprints/doc/131610860.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Aug%2029,%201946&amp;author=&amp;pub=Wall%20Street%20Journal&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Thing-of-the-Month%20Club%20Gets%20Industry%20Aid%20For%20Its%20Science%20Service|title=Thing-of-the-Month Club Gets Industry Aid For Its Science Service|last=Robitscher|first=Jonas|date=August 29, 1946|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The box contained a yellow booklet explaining the topic for that month, along with the pieces and supplies needed to cover the topic.  Some kits would teach about a specific topic, such as [[coal]], [[static electricity]], [[mechanical linkage]]s, [[nonwoven fabric]]s, [[electroplating]], or [[optical illusions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vxVSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_XYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2361,370608&amp;dq=things-of-science&amp;hl=en|title=Experimental unit shows seeing not believing|date=August 21, 1959|work=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other kits would provide parts to build items such as a small [[spectrograph]], [[telescope]], or [[pinhole camera]]. In addition to the monthly subscription, some kits were available for individual purchase, such as a "soilless gardening" unit which provided seeds, plant food, and instructions in [[hydroponics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vWFkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=U3wNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4160,2587703&amp;dq=things-of-science&amp;hl=en|title=New Kit Grows Plants Without Soil|date=May 11, 1961|work=Calgary Herald|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some kits contained basic materials for simple experiments in psychology.&lt;ref name="Schlosberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schlosberg |first1=Harold |title=Things of Science. |journal=American Psychologist |date=1953 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=124–125 |doi=10.1037/h0053882 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modest annual subscription price ($5 in the 1960s) covered the cost of printing and postage. The instructions were written by Science Service staff, and the kit materials were donated by various companies.&lt;ref name="Knetzger"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Knetzger |first1=Bob |title=Things of Science |url=https://makezine.com/2011/01/25/things-of-science/ |website=Make: DIY Projects and Ideas for Makers |accessdate=29 June 2018 |date=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Things of Science Club was started by Watson Davis, editor-in-chief of Science Service, because editors served by the service often asked for samples of the things the syndicate wrote about. The initial focus of the program was newspaper editors, but it soon shifted to young people. By 1946 the Science Service estimated that half of its subscribers were school groups and science clubs, and the other half were individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecg.mit.edu/george/tos/|title=Rediscovering Things of Science|last=Moody|first=George B.|work=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in the club was limited to a few thousand because some of the "things", such as dinosaur bones, were hard to come by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1hwiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QKQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4985,4298460&amp;dq=things-of-science&amp;hl=en|title=Thing-of-the-Month Club will provide remarkable objects|last=Othman|first=Frederick C.|date=October 7, 1947|work=San Jose Evening News|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Urban rail in the UK.svg|300px|right]]
'''Urban rail''', '''[[commuter rail]]''', '''regional rail''', or '''suburban rail''' plays a key role in [[public transport]] in many of the [[United Kingdom]]'s major cities. Urban rail is defined as a rail service between a central business district and suburbs or other locations that draw large numbers of people on a daily basis. The trains providing such services may be termed commuter trains.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.123exp-trains.com/t/18664055193/,commuter%20rail,Regional%20rail&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[light rail]], urban rail is classed as [[heavy rail]], operating on lines shared with other passenger and [[freight]] trains with networks often larger than those of light rail.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The infrastructure in [[Great Britain]] is owned by [[Network Rail]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/ |title=We own and operate Britain's rail infrastructure |publisher=Network Rail |date= |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stations served by one urban rail network may be managed by different train companies.  In [[Northern Ireland]] [[NI Railways]] have responsibility for both the infrastructure and operations.

==Advantages over light rail==
[[File:Increase in passenger rail by sector 1994-2014.png|thumb|360px|Increase in passenger rail by sector 1994-2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/displayreport/report/html/34856085-cf9c-4e0d-a7f8-8f9e5ee1b772 |title=Passenger kilometres by sector}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a comparison with the [[London Underground]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/247943/response/615921/attach/3/150129HW%20LUDemandSince1956.xls&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://content.tfl.gov.uk/annual-report-2014-15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As urban rail networks are part of the wider rail network, there is often easy interchange with [[Main line (railway)|mainline rail]], rail cards being accepted. [[bicycle|Cycles]] can be taken on board in the majority of cases, and existing railways can be used, rather than new light railways being built.

Unlike most light rail systems, only one ticket needs to be bought if a journey includes both mainline and urban rail. Urban rail usually has higher capacity than light rail because of longer trains (but often lower frequency), and higher average speed because of fewer stops.

In some cases, suburban railway networks have their own ticketing system, like in West Yorkshire.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

==Services==
A few urban railways offer service during peak times only, and others operate less frequent trains during the evenings and on Sundays.

Networks often encompass a few major stations in a large city, with other stations being medium or minor. Services can be provided by one [[train operating company]] operating exclusively on an urban rail network, such as in [[Merseyside]], or by a company that also operates regional and national services, like in [[Bristol]], [[Cardiff]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]].

===Belfast===
[[File:Train, Dunmurry station - geograph.org.uk - 1558797.jpg|thumb|right|Belfast area [[NIR Class 3000|Class 3000]] commuter train at {{stnlnk|Dunmurry}}.]]
In [[Northern Ireland]]'s capital, [[Northern Ireland Railways]] [[Belfast Suburban Rail]] serves [[Greater Belfast]]. Services run about every 20 minutes from 06:00 until 24:00 on:
*[[Belfast-Larne railway line|Larne Line]]: [[Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station|Belfast Great Victoria Street]] - {{stnlnk|Belfast Central}} - {{stnlnk|Larne Harbour}}
*[[Belfast-Newry railway line|Portadown Line]]: Belfast Central - Portadown - {{stnlnk|Newry}}
*[[Belfast-Bangor railway line|Bangor Line]]: Belfast Great Victoria Street - Belfast Central - [[Sydenham railway station, Northern Ireland|Sydenham]] - Bangor

Some services run between Larne and Portadown, calling at all stations. Belfast Suburban Rail serves 39 different stations on three lines.

===Birmingham===

[[File:Birmingham New Street railway station MMB 02 323204.jpg|thumb|right|[[British Rail Class 323|Class 323]] commuter train in the West Midlands]]
Co-ordinated and subsidised by [[Transport for West Midlands]] (TfWM), (formerly known as Centro) [[West Midlands Trains]] operates a [[List of railway stations in the West Midlands|network of 70 stations]] in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands county]] focused on [[Birmingham]]. West Midlands Trains operate the West Midlands commuter routes under the ''West Midlands Railway'' branding to distinguish them from their longer-distance routes. The main city-centre station is [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]], operated by [[Network Rail]], the other city-centre stations are [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill]] and [[Birmingham Moor Street railway station|Birmingham Moor Street]]. The other main stations in the West Midlands are {{stnlink|Wolverhampton}} and {{stnlink|Coventry}}.

During 2014/15, there were nearly 51 million rail passenger journeys in the TfWM area.&lt;ref name=2015WM&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 West Midlands Travel Trends|url=http://www.wmita.org.uk/media/8790/west-midlands-travel-trends-2015.pdf|publisher=Centro|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birmingham has the highest proportion of rail commuters in England outside London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tacking rail growth in the city regions.|url=http://www.pteg.net/system/files/general-docs/Modern_Railways_supplement.pdf|publisher=Modern Railways|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past few decades the proportion of journeys into central Birmingham by rail has grown sharply: 29% of journeys into Birmingham city centre in the peak hours were made by rail in 2015,&lt;ref name=2015WM/&gt; compared to 17% in 2001, 12% in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birmingham City Council Evidence All-Party Parliamentary Group for High Speed Rail March 2012|url=http://www.appghsr.co.uk/upload/Birmingham%20City%20Council%20submission.pdf|publisher=All-Party Parliamentary Group for High Speed Rail|accessdate=20 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Plan 2006 - Route 17: West Midlands - Network Rail|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:1uljgmOp0wsJ:www.networkrail.co.uk/documents/3115_Route_2017_West_Midlands.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgw2bkcUFSoyKs8iDXFWpgQT2Qsx7rrcMTQfVSi20QpVdVgluI6_I0g-kCQfiUj_LrhBrV5i-Y-edhSH9AZGFNZ5spctY9novvcxadmUcM_Sw6MxLvLetgzW0YsGFF69R8hirl8&amp;sig=AHIEtbRGf63SRsczF-BiJRKZrQ0t5G-fFQ|publisher=www.networkrail.co.uk|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Birmingham and West Midlands County local commuter lines are centred on New Street station, including the [[Cross-City Line]], the [[Chase Line]] and the [[Rugby-Birmingham-Stafford Line|Coventry-Wolverhampton Line]]. Three commuter routes, known collectively as the [[Snow Hill Lines]] run through Snow Hill and Moor Street stations. Services run at ten-minute frequencies on the busiest routes, with most other routes operating at least a 15-20 or 30 minute frequency. Routes are below:

West Midlands Trains routes operating from {{rws|Birmingham New Street}}:

* '''[[Stourbridge Town branch line]]''' - {{rws|Stourbridge Junction}} - {{rws|Stourbridge Town}}

The [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] created in 2016, is pursuing plans to restore local passenger services to the [[Camp Hill Line]] in southern Birmingham, which is currently freight only, by constructing new chords into Birmingham Moor Street station.&lt;ref name=Chamberlain/&gt; Restoration of local passenger services to the freight only [[Walsall to Wolverhampton Line]], is also being pursued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Could Moseley to Birmingham trains return to end commuter hell?|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/could-moseley-birmingham-trains-return-11443290|publisher=Birmingham Mail|accessdate=20 July 2016|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chamberlain&gt;{{cite web|title=£4Bn West Midlands transport boost unveiled by council leaders|url=http://www.thechamberlainfiles.com/4bn-west-midlands-transport-boost-unveiled-by-council-leaders/|publisher=The Chamberlain Files|accessdate=20 July 2016|date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centro was created in 1969 following the [[Transport Act 1968]]. The [[Transport Act 1985]] deregulated and privatised bus services across the UK. WMPTE co-ordinated the services of all local private bus operators and adopted the name of Centro shortly afterwards to distinguish itself from its previous role as an operator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centro.org.uk/corporateinformation/home.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216005911/http://www.centro.org.uk/corporateinformation/home.asp |date=16 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Centro was abolished and replaced with Transport for West Midlands.

===Bristol===

[[File:Bristol area rail map.svg|thumb|right|Urban rail network in and around Bristol]]
There are 13 suburban and two main-line stations ([[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]] and [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]]) in [[Bristol]], all operated by [[First Great Western]]. The only commuter line is the 13.5 mile long [[Severn Beach Line]] with 11 stations and 374,000 journeys in 2005/6. The operator estimates that 57% of travellers on the line commute, rather than for leisure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/Documents/Custom/Severn%20Beach%20Line%20Development%20Plan.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Severn Beach Line Development Plan.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Services run every half an hour to [[Avonmouth railway station|Avonmouth]] and continue every hour to [[Severn Beach railway station|Severn Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/Documents/Custom/Dec%2008%20BOOK%20E%20WEB%20(timetable%20only)%20.pdf |title=Layout 1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; If given approval, then a further two commuter lines from [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]] to [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]] and [[Henbury]] would open in 2019&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travelwest.info/projects/metrowest/metrowest-phase-1 |title=MetroWest: Phase 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2021&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travelwest.info/project/metrowest-phase-2 |title=MetroWest: Phase 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. Services also run from Gloucester - Westbury and Cardiff Central - Taunton via Bristol.

Other suburban stations lie on main lines, [[South Wales Main Line]] (Bristol – Cardiff via Newport), [[Great Western Main Line]] (Bristol – London via Bath, Chippenham, Swindon and Reading) and [[Wessex Main Line]] (Bristol – Southampton via Bath and Salisbury).

Commuter services operate to and from nearby [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/Content.aspx?id=3396&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiff===
{{see also|Rail transport in Cardiff}}
[[File:ATW-142002-CardiffCentral-01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arriva Trains Wales]] {{brc|142}} Cardiff commuter train]]
[[File:South-east Wales rail network map.svg|thumb|right|The network within Cardiff]]
The [[Valley Lines]] network of eight lines ([[Butetown Branch Line|Cardiff Bay Line]], [[Cardiff City Line|City Line]], [[Coryton Line]], [[Maesteg Line]], [[Merthyr Line]], [[Rhondda Line]], [[Rhymney Line]] and [[Vale of Glamorgan Line]]) incorporates 20 stations in [[Cardiff]], the capital of [[Wales]], and 61 in surrounding towns and villages. Its hubs are [[Cardiff Queen Street railway station|Cardiff Queen Street]] and [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff Central]]. Train frequencies are up to every five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=5482 |title=showcontent |publisher=Arrivatrainswales.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] also draws commuters to the capital.

[[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]] operates the stations and services. In February 2008, the Ebbw Valley Railway re-opened after 45 years with an hourly service to Cardiff Central.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/ebbwvale/pages/railway.shtml |title=South East Wales Ebbw Vale - Ebbw Valley Railway |publisher=BBC |date=2008-06-02 |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the line's closure in 1962, passengers had had to change at [[Newport railway station|Newport]].

The Maesteg line is incorporated into the wider network: trains continue to [[Cheltenham Spa railway station|Cheltenham Spa]] from Cardiff Central. The Vale of Glamorgan Line serves [[Cardiff International Airport]].

However, the network neglects large residential areas in the south-west and east of Cardiff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=4776 |title=showcontent |publisher=Arrivatrainswales.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525204307/http://www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=4776 |archive-date=25 May 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[South Wales Main Line]] runs through these areas without any stations. These areas include [[Caerau, Cardiff|Caerau]] in the south-west and [[Rumney, Cardiff|Rumney]] and [[St Mellons]] in the east.

Between 1995 and 2001, the network (except the Maesteg Line) was operated by ''[[Valley Lines (train operating company)|Valley Lines]]'', the trading name of the Cardiff Railway Company. It then became part of the [[Wales &amp; Borders]] franchise before becoming part of the [[Arriva Trains Wales]] franchise in 2003, and subsequently the [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]] franchise in 2018.

===Edinburgh===
[[File:Edinburgh Waverley Railway Station 04.JPG|thumb|right|Edinburgh commuter train]]
[[Abellio ScotRail]] operates four commuter lines (with 40 stations) in and around the [[Scotland|Scottish]] capital: the [[North Clyde Line]], the [[Borders Railway]], the [[Edinburgh to Dunblane Line]] and the [[Fife Circle Line]]. [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh Waverley]] and [[Haymarket railway station|Haymarket]] are the city's two major stations with connections to mainline services.

A project to open a [[Edinburgh Airport railway station|rail link to Edinburgh Airport]] was cancelled in September 2007 by the Scottish Government in favour of construction of a station at nearby [[Gogar, Edinburgh|Gogar]], which will connect with the [[Edinburgh tram network]] to take passengers to the terminal.&lt;ref name=edinAirport&gt;{{cite news

===Exeter===
Despite being a relatively small city, [[Exeter]] is served by four commuter lines/services. Nine railway stations are within its boundaries (seven of them being suburban), which means the city is served exceptionally well by rail for a city of its size. The main hub of the network is [[Exeter St Davids railway station]] which has six platforms and three operators serving the station. The three platform [[Exeter Central railway station]] also serves as a hub for the network being located in the city centre. However, the only long distance service that stops at the station is the [[West of England main line]].

The [[Avocet Line]] runs from Exeter St Davids to [[Exmouth]], a medium-sized commuter town and seaside resort, via [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]], [[Exton, Devon|Exton]] and [[Lympstone]].

The [[Riviera Line]] runs from Exeter St Davids to [[Paignton]] via [[Teignmouth]], [[Newton Abbot]] and [[Torquay]].
 
The [[Tarka Line]] is the only railway line that serves [[North Devon]] and runs from Exeter St Davids to [[Barnstaple]] via [[Crediton]].

During rush hour, [[South West Trains]] operate commuter services that terminate at [[Honiton]].

===Glasgow===
{{main article|Strathclyde Partnership for Transport#Strathclyde rail services}}
[[File:380004 at Largs 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Glasgow commuter train]]
Glasgow is Scotland's biggest city and has the UK's largest suburban rail network outside London. Much of the network is electrified, with some lines operated by diesel trains. Trains are operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]]; [[Transport Scotland]] oversees the management of routes, fares and timetables for all train services in Scotland - until 2005, train services around Glasgow were managed by [[Strathclyde Partnership for Transport|Strathclyde Passenger Transport]]. Because of this historic split there are differences between train services in Strathclyde and the rest of Scotland. There is no [[First class travel]] in Strathclyde, and morning peak time finishes at 09:00 (rather than 09:15) with no evening peak time.

[[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central]] and [[Glasgow Queen Street]] are the two mainline train stations, both in the city centre. Services to the south leave from Central, and to the north leave from Queen Street. Two lines run underground east to west through the city centre: the North Clyde line through Queen Street and the Argyle Line through Central, from underground platforms below the mainline stations. The North Clyde and Argyle lines meet at [[Partick railway station|Partick]], which is also served by the [[Glasgow Subway]]. There are Subway stations near Central (St Enoch) and Queen Street (Buchanan Street).

A bus services to [[Glasgow International Airport]] operates from [[Paisley Gilmour Street railway station|Paisley Gilmour Street station]]. [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport]] has its own railway station on the Ayrshire Coast line, and is the only airport in Scotland with its own station. A [[Glasgow Airport Rail Link|direct rail link]] from Glasgow Central to Glasgow International Airport was planned, but was cancelled in 2009.

===Liverpool===
[[File:Merseyrail Map.svg|thumb|left|Merseyrail map]]
[[File:508141-LiverpoolLS-01.jpg|thumb|right|Commuter train in Merseyside]]
The partially underground [[Merseyrail]] network consists of three lines, the [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]], [[Wirral Line]] and [[City Line (Merseyrail)|City Line]], which interconnect in Liverpool's city centre. The Northern and Wirral Lines run in tunnels in the centres of  Liverpool and Birkenhead. Liverpool is the nucleus of the network, which sees 100,000 people a day travel through 68 stations on the electrified lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merseyrail.org/about/?sGUID=2a45e2d07d59c0d621570a918cb62195 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218110233/http://www.merseyrail.org/about/?sGUID=2a45e2d07d59c0d621570a918cb62195 |date=18 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;There is 21 stations on the City Line that serves the Merseyside area. The origins of the network are old, dating back 1848 and the [[Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway]], one of the world's first commuter lines, and to the 1886 [[Mersey Railway]], which was the world's second oldest underground railway. An early commuter was [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], United Stated consul to Liverpool, 1853-57.

The 75 mile long electric third rail Northern and Wirral Lines are 100% dedicated Merseyrail lines operating separately from the City Line. The City Line currently uses diesel trains operated by [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]]. The local passenger transport executive, [[Merseytravel]], brands all commuter rail lines running through Merseyside as Merseyrail with stations inside Merseyside branded as Merseyrail stations. The City Line will be fully electrified by the end of 2014.

The Northern and Wirral lines operate under the [[train operating company]] called Merseyrail. Commuter trains run on both the electrified lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merseyrail.org/documents/NetworkMap.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206124018/http://www.merseyrail.org/documents/NetworkMap.pdf |date=6 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The service operates at metro frequencies in central Liverpool and Birkenhead.

The City Line is operated by [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] running into Merseyside from outside the region, receiving funding from Merseytravel. The City Line consists of non-electrified lines heading east and one electrified running south. {{stnlnk|Liverpool Lime Street}} is the terminus of the City Line, with a connection to the Wirral Line at Lime Street underground station. There is also a connection with the Northern Line at {{stnlnk|Liverpool South Parkway}} in the south of Liverpool. The City Line is to be electrified to the Wigan and Manchester branches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sthelensreporter.co.uk/st-helens-news/Electric-rail-link-plans-for.5919874.jp Electrification of the Liverpool - Wigan Line]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Class_323_-_Manchester_Piccadilly.jpg|thumb|left|A south Manchester commuter train at [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]].]]
Commuting via rail by wealthy merchants living in North [[Cheshire]] and South [[Lancashire]] into the centre of Manchester was a fairly early phenomenon thanks to the opening of railways such as the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], [[Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway]], [[Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway]] &amp; [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]], in the 1830s &amp; 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=490812601421239E5DE971329DEC78EB.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=64589 |title=Cambridge Journals Online - Abstract |publisher=Journals.cambridge.org |date=2001-01-23 |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All had stations in what were then the outskirts of Manchester, from where citizens could take a train into the centre of the city. [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]], [[Alderley Edge]] and [[Wilmslow]] are examples of early settlements that had railway stations in the early-mid-19th century and grew into sizable commuter towns. 
 
Urban rail services to [[Manchester]] nowadays forms part of the [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] network.

Around 25 million journeys are made on the Greater Manchester local rail network, compared to 34 million [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] tram journeys. Buses make up a far bigger number than both however with 225 million journeys per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tfgm.com/Corporate/Media_Centre/Pages/facts_figures.aspx |title=TfGM Facts &amp; Figures  |access-date=10 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704034705/http://www.tfgm.com/Corporate/Media_Centre/Pages/facts_figures.aspx |archive-date=4 July 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=statsrelease&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/527742/light-rail-tram-ending-march-2016.pdf|publisher= [[Department for Transport]]|date=7 June 2016 |accessdate=8 June 2016 |title=Light Rail and Tram Statistics: England 2015/16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest point of entry to the city is [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]] which accommodates 13 lines &lt;ref name="northernrail.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northernrail.org/travel/timetables/296800 |title=Travel Tools - Timetables - Manchester Piccadilly |publisher=Northern Rail |date=2010-12-12 |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; on which services are provided up to around every 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northernrail.org/pdfs/timetables/20081117/15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These include lines to/from [[Bolton railway station|Bolton]], [[New Mills Central railway station|New Mills Central]], [[Crewe railway station|Crewe]], [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool Lime Street]], [[Chester railway station|Chester]], [[Warrington Central railway station|Warrington Central]], [[Hadfield railway station|Hadfield]] / [[Glossop railway station|Glossop]], [[Huddersfield railway station|Huddersfield]] and [[Southport railway station|Southport]].&lt;ref name="northernrail.org"/&gt;

[[List of railway stations in Greater Manchester|91 stations]] are within the Greater Manchester ticketing zone. There are links to the [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] tram network at Manchester Piccadilly, Manchester Victoria, Manchester Deansgate, Altrincham, Navigation Road, Eccles (400m walk), Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne (from 2013), East Didsbury (200m walk) and Manchester Airport. Tickets bought for rail travel within Greater Manchester ticketing zone to the four city-centre stations (Deansgate, Oxford Road, Victoria and Piccadilly) are to "Manchester Central Zone", rendered on the ticket as "MANCHESTER CTLZ", and allow free tram travel within the Metrolink tram city fare zone (eight stops within the Piccadilly-Victoria-Deansgate station triangle).

[[Transport for Greater Manchester]] co-ordinates rail services within [[Greater Manchester]].  It was created in 1969 as the SELNEC PTE (South East Lancashire North East Cheshire) following the [[Transport Act 1968]], and was renamed GMPTE in 1974 before becoming TfGM in 2011.

===Greater London===
{{See also|Transport in London#Heavy rail}}
[[File:London_Railway_Network.jpg|thumb|The London railway network]]
Stations in London (apart from {{rws|Heathrow Central}}) are within Travelcard zones. Some stations outside Greater London, for example [[Chigwell tube station|Chigwell]] in [[Essex]], are within zones 4-6; many stations outside London are within zones 6-9, for example [[Amersham station|Amersham]] and {{rws|Shenfield}}, but some stations much closer to the Greater London boundary, like {{rws|Esher}} and {{rws|Staines}}, are not in any zone. London has an integrated ticketing system via the Travelcard or [[Oyster Card]] for buses, Docklands Light Railway, suburban rail, tram, Underground and Overground.

Unlike cities like Liverpool/Merseyside, Sydney and Paris, several operators provide suburban rail services. Most stations are served at least every 20 minutes, with many stations and routes having four, six or more trains per hour.

====Chiltern Railways====
[[File:Chiltern at Marylebone.jpg|thumb|right|Chiltern Railways trains]]
Chiltern Railways serves eight stations within London from [[Marylebone station|Marylebone]], with up to two trains per hour. {{rws|Sudbury &amp; Harrow Road}}, London's least used station, has no services outside peak hours or on weekends.

There is a proposal for a Chiltern Metro Service between [[London Marylebone|Marylebone]] and [[West Ruislip railway station|West Ruislip]], operating at 4+ trains per hour, stopping at Wembley Stadium, Sudbury &amp; Harrow Road, Sudbury Hill Harrow, Northolt Park, South Ruislip and West Ruislip. This would require a reversing facility at West Ruislip, passing loops at Sudbury Hill Harrow and Wembley Stadium (part of the old down fast line is in use as a central reversing siding for stock movements and eight-car shuttles for stadium events).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londontravelwatch.org.uk/get_document.php?id=497|title=There’s more to Chiltern than the Chilterns - The Case for a Chiltern Metro|date=January 2001|publisher=www.londontravelwatch.org.uk|access-date=1 February 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311030147/http://www.londontravelwatch.org.uk/get_document.php?id=497|archive-date=11 March 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crossrail====
[[Crossrail]] is a project to connect the [[Great Western Main Line]] with the [[Great Eastern Main Line]], via tunnels through central London, with a branch to {{rws|Abbey Wood}}. It is the largest construction project in Europe. Crossrail will start a full service in 2018, taking over suburban services operated by [[Abellio Greater Anglia]] to Shenfield, Heathrow Connect to Heathrow Airport and First Great Western to Reading.

Once opened, [[Crossrail]] will be one of three partially underground suburban rail networks in the [[United Kingdom]] as the network cannot be classed as a Metro system like the [[London Underground]] or the [[Glasgow Subway]]. The [[Merseyrail]] and Glasgow commuter rail networks also have below ground stations.

[[Crossrail 2]] is a prospective line running north-east to south-west through London.

===Newcastle Upon Tyne===
As well as the [[Tyne &amp; Wear Metro]], [[Wearside]] and [[Tyneside]] are linked by fast Northern Rail trains.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nexus.org.uk/rail&lt;/ref&gt; The whole network is made up of two lines, the [[Durham Coast Line]] and the [[Tyne Valley Line]] which link Newcastle with [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Hexham]], [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] and [[Middlesbrough]] with 25 stations overall. These services are funded by Nexus and is one of four transport systems serving [[Tyne and Wear]], with the others being the Metro, the [[Shields Ferry]] and the large bus network which serves the county and surrounding communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nexus.org.uk/bus&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Rail also runs services that terminate at [[Chathill]].

===Plymouth===
Plymouth is served by the [[Tamar Valley Line]] which primarily runs through suburban areas in the  west of the city. The line has nine stations and terminates at [[Gunnislake railway station]] in the neighbouring county of [[Cornwall]].
Five of the stations are within the boundaries of [[Plymouth]] while an extra two are within the [[West Devon]] district and another two are in [[Cornwall]]. The only railway station in [[Plymouth]] which is not served by this line is [[St Budeaux Ferry Road railway station]] which is on the Cornish main line in the northwestern suburb of [[St Budeaux]]. The line may be extended to the eastern suburb of Plympton and two sites have been earmarked for a station.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/new-plymouth-metro-could-include-new-station-in-plympton/story-30156846-detail/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Largest Commuter Rail Networks===
This is a list for the largest commuter rail networks in the [[United Kingdom]] outside [[London]]. London's commuter rail network has several operators and over 500 stations on many different lines.

The '''Uru''' or '''Uros''' ({{lang-ure|Qhas Qut suñi}}) are an [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] of [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]]. They live on an approximate and still growing 120 self-fashioned [[floating island]]s in [[Lake Titicaca]] near [[Puno]]. They form three main groups: the Uru-Chipaya, [[Uru-Murato]], and Uru-Iruito. The Uru-Iruito still inhabit the Bolivian side of Lake Titicaca and the [[Desaguadero River (Bolivia)|Desaguadero River]].

==History==
According to legend, the Uru descend from a people that spoke the [[Puquina language]]. They considered themselves the owners of the lake and water. According to the legend, Uru used to say that they had black blood, because they did not feel the cold. They historically called themselves ''Lupihaques'' ("Sons of the Sun"). Although most Uru languages have been lost, they continue to maintain their identity and some old customs.&lt;ref name="conociendo" /&gt;

The purpose of the island settlements was originally defensive; if a threat arose the floating islands could be moved. The largest island retains a watchtower almost entirely constructed of reeds.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The Uru traded with the [[Aymara ethnic group|Aymara]] tribe on the mainland, intermarrying with them and eventually abandoning the Uru language for that of the Aymara. About 500 years ago they lost their original language. When conquered by the [[Inca empire]], they had to pay taxes to them, and often were made [[Slavery|slave]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Reed island construction==
The Uru use bundles of dried [[Totora (plant)|totora reeds]] to make [[reed boat]]s (''balsas''), and to make the islands themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Totora (plant) |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2016 |url=https://www.britannica.com/plant/totora |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521112819/http://www.britannica.com/plant/totora |archivedate=2016-05-21
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger islands house about ten families, while smaller ones, only about thirty meters wide, house only two or three families.&lt;ref name="mincetur" /&gt;

The islets are made of [[totora (plant)|totora]] reeds, which grow in the lake. The dense roots that the plants develop and interweave form a natural layer called Khili (about one to two meters thick) that support the islands. They are anchored with ropes attached to sticks driven into the bottom of the lake.  The reeds at the bottoms of the islands rot away fairly quickly, so new reeds are added to the top constantly, about every three months; this is what makes it exciting for [[Tourism|tourist]]s when walking on the island.&lt;ref name="conociendo"/&gt; This is especially important in the rainy season when the reeds rot much faster.  The islands last about thirty years.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Each step on an island sinks about 2-4" depending on the density of the ground underfoot. As the reeds dry, they break up more and more as they are walked upon. As the reed breaks up and moisture gets to it, it rots, and a new layer has to be added to it. It is a lot of work to maintain the islands. Because the people living there receive so many tourists now, they have less time to maintain everything, so they have to work even harder in order to keep up with the tourists and with the maintenance of their island.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Tourism provides financial opportunities for the natives, while simultaneously challenging their traditional lifestyle.

The Uru's islands are located at 3810 meters above sea level, and just five kilometers west from Puno port.&lt;ref name="mincetur"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.mincetur.gob.pe/newweb/Portals/0/PUNO.pdf
|title=Puno
|publisher=Mincetur
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2,000 descendants of the Uru were counted in the 1997 census,&lt;ref name="conociendo"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although only a few hundred still live on and maintain the islands; most have moved to the mainland. The Uru also bury their dead on the mainland in special cemeteries.

Food is cooked with fires placed on piles of stones. To relieve themselves, tiny 'outhouse' islands are near the main islands. The ground root absorbs the waste.

==Traditional lifestyle==

Much of the Urus' diet and medicine also revolve around the same [[totora (plant)|totora]] reeds used to construct the islands. When a reed is pulled, the white bottom is often eaten for [[iodine]]. This prevents [[goitre]]s. This white part of the reed is called the ''chullo'' ([[Aymara ethnic group|Aymara]] {{IPA-ay|tʃʼuʎo|}}). The Uru rely on totora reeds in the same way that the Andean people of Peru rely on the [[coca]] leaf for relief from hunger and the harsh climate. When in pain, they may wrap the reed around the body part that is in pain. If it is hot outside, they sometimes roll the white part of the reed in their hands and split it open, placing the reed on their forehead. In this form, it is very cool to the touch. The white part of the reed is also used to help ease alcohol-related hangovers. The totora reeds are a primary source of food. The Uru also make a reed flower [[tea]].

Local residents fish [[Pupfish|ispi]], [[carachi]] and [[catfish]]. [[Trout]] was introduced to the lake from [[Canada]] in 1940, and [[Odontesthes bonariensis|kingfish]] was introduced from [[Argentina]]. Uru also hunt birds such as [[Gull|seagull]]s, [[duck]]s and [[flamingo]]s, and graze their [[cattle]] on the islets. They also run crafts stalls aimed at the numerous tourists who visit ten of the islands each year. They barter totora reeds on the mainland in [[Puno]] to get products they need, such as [[quinoa]] and other foods.

==Domesticated animals==
The Uru people have domesticated local animals to assist with producing food and other purposes. For example, [[cormorant]]s, waterbirds who catch fish, are kept tethered with wool tied to their feet, so that they can catch fish for human consumption. Another local bird, the [[ibis]], is domesticated for laying eggs.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Ibis are also butchered for meat. To control rats on the reed islands, domestic cats are also kept by the Uru islanders.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Modern life==
The Uru do not reject modern technology: some boats have motors, some houses have solar panels to run appliances such as televisions and the main island is home to an Uru-run [[Frequency modulation|FM]] [[Radio broadcasting|radio station]], which plays music for several hours a day.

Early schooling is done on several islands, including a traditional school and a school run by a [[Christianity|Christian]] church. Older children and university students attend school on the mainland, often in nearby Puno.

Historically, most of the Uru islands were located near the middle of the lake, about 9 miles from the shore; however, in 1986, after a major storm devastated the islands, many Uru rebuilt closer to shore.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite web |title=The Island People: The seventh hidden wonder of South America |first=Joshua |last=Foer |date=February 25, 2011 |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/world_of_wonders/2011/02/the_island_people.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007101004/http://www.slate.com/articles/life/world_of_wonders/2011/02/the_island_people.html |archivedate=2016-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{As of|2011}}, about 1,200 Uru lived on an archipelago of 60 artificial islands,&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; clustering in the western corner of the lake near the port town of Puno.&lt;ref name=natgeo/&gt; The islands have become one of Peru's tourist attractions, allowing the Uru to supplement their hunting and fishing by conveying visitors to the islands by motorboat and selling handicrafts.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;{{cite web |title=Rough Waters for Peru's Floating Islands |first=Zoltan |last=Istvan |website=National Geographic Channel |date=July 3, 2003 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/07/0703_030703_laketiticaca.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806103417/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/07/0703_030703_laketiticaca.html |archivedate=2016-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Warlpiri''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɑr|l|b|r|i}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɔː|l|p|ər|i}})&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; language is spoken by about 3,000 of the [[Warlpiri people]] in Australia's [[Northern Territory]]. It is one of the [[Ngarrkic languages]] of the large [[Pama–Nyungan languages|Pama–Nyungan family]], and is one of the largest aboriginal languages in Australia in terms of number of speakers.

== Phonology ==
{{IPA notice}}
In the following tables of the Warlpiri sound system, symbols in '''boldface''' give the practical alphabet used by the Warlpiri community.  Phonetic values in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] are shown in [square brackets].

=== Vowels ===

As shown in the chart, Warlpiri distinguishes five positions of articulation, and has oral and nasal stops at each position.  The oral stops have no [[phonemic]] [[phonation|voice]] distinction, but display voiced and unvoiced [[allophones]]; stops are usually unvoiced at the beginning of a word, and voiced elsewhere. In both positions they are usually unaspirated.

Warlpiri, like most Australian languages, has no [[fricative consonant|fricative]] consonants.

The consonant listed in the table as a retroflex flap is actually an unusual consonant, possibly unique to Warlpiri.  The tongue-tip begins in retroflex position, but then moves forward rapidly, flapping against the alveolar ridge.

=== Syllables and stress ===

Warlpiri [[syllables]] are quite constrained in structure.  All syllables begin with a single consonant; there are no syllable-initial consonant clusters, and no syllable begins with a vowel.  After the consonant comes a single long or short vowel, which is sometimes followed by a single closing consonant.  Open syllables are much more common than closed ones.  No syllable ends with a stop or with the retroflex flap /ɽ/.

The most common kind of consonant cluster occurs when a syllable ends with a nasal consonant and the next syllable begins with the corresponding stop, but other clusters like /rk/ and /lp/ also occur.

Stress is not generally distinctive, but assigned by rule.  Polysyllabic words receive primary stress on the first syllable, with secondary stresses tending to occur on alternate syllables thereafter; this rhythm may be broken by the structure of the word, so that there are sometimes three-syllable stress groups.

=== Vowel harmony ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Vowel harmony]] --&gt;

If two adjacent syllables in a Warlpiri [[morpheme]] have high vowels, then those high vowels are almost always alike; that is, both '''u''' or both '''i'''.  The number of Warlpiri roots with adjacent syllables having '''u''' and '''i''' is very small. Both ''progressive'' and ''regressive'' vowel harmony occur.  In progressive vowel harmony, the second vowel changes to match the first; in regressive harmony, the first changes to match the second.

This tendency to prefer adjacent high vowels to be identical also spreads across morpheme boundaries within a word.  Adding a suffix to a word can place a '''u''' and an '''i''' in contact.  When this happens, one of the vowels tends to assimilate: that is, it changes to match the other vowel.  This kind of [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] is called ''[[vowel harmony]]''. Vowel harmony is not rare in the world's languages: it is found, for example, in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. 

Regressive harmony only occurs when attaching a tense suffix to a verb (see below).  For example, when the verb '''panti-''' (class 2) is placed in the past tense with the suffix '''-rnu''', the result is '''panturnu''', not '''*pantirnu'''. Progressive harmony occurs with most other kinds of suffixes.  For example, when the ergative case suffix '''-ngku''' is attached to the noun '''karli''' "boomerang", the result is '''karlingki''', not '''*karlingku'''.

On occasion, long chains of high vowels can assimilate, each forcing the next.  For example, when the class 2 verb '''kiji-''' is attached to the past tense suffix '''-rnu''', the resulting word is '''kujurnu'''.

=== Words ===

No Warlpiri word begins with an alveolar consonant; the first consonant of a word must be bilabial, palatal, retroflex, or velar. Exceptions to this include borrowings such as ''tala'' 'dollar', from English ''dollar''.

All Warlpiri words end in vowels.  A word whose final meaningful component ends in a consonant is usually "corrected" by appending a meaningless suffix, usually '''-pa'''.

== Alphabet ==

Since the 1950s, Warlpiri has been written in Latin script using an alphabet originally devised by [[Lothar Jagst]] and subsequently modified slightly. The Warlpiri alphabet uses only ordinary letters, with no accent marks.  It is close to IPA, deviating in the following ways:

#Long vowels are written by doubling the vowel letter: '''ii''', '''aa''', '''uu'''.
#Retroflex consonants are written with digraphs formed by prefixing '''r''' to the usual alveolar symbol: '''rt''', '''rn''', '''rl'''.
#The palatal stop is written '''j'''.
#Other palatals are written with digraphs formed by suffixing '''y''' to the usual alveolar symbol: '''ny''', '''ly'''.  The palatal approximant is written '''y'''.
#The velar nasal is written '''ng'''.
#The alveolar trill is written '''rr'''.
#The retroflex flap is written '''rd'''.
#The retroflex approximant is written '''r'''.

To these basic rules are added two adjustments to make the alphabet easier to use.

#The indicators '''y''' (for palatal) and '''r''' (for retroflex) are often dropped if redundant in consonant clusters that share articulation position.  Examples: '''nyj''' is written '''nj''', '''rnrt''' is written '''rnt'''.
#At the beginning of a word, the retroflex indicator '''r''' may be omitted.  This does not produce ambiguity, because no Warlpiri word begins with a plain alveolar consonant.  Example: '''rtari''' "foot" is written '''tari'''.

== Morphology ==

=== Verbs ===

Warlpiri verbs are built from a few hundred verb roots, distributed among five conjugation classes.  Two of these classes contain the vast majority of verb roots; the other three classes have only a few roots each.

A large class of modifying prefixes, or ''preverbs'', are used to create verbs with specific meanings.  For example, the verb root '''parnka-''' means "run" when used by itself, while '''wurulyparnka-''' means "scurry into hiding".  The preverb '''wuruly-''' is used with a few other verb roots to form other verbs of hiding or seclusion.  Preverbs are sometimes reduplicated for emphasis or to create a meaning distinction.

Most preverb-verb combinations are a fixed part of the lexicon; new combinations cannot be created freely.  But there are a few preverbs that are very productive and can be combined with many different roots, and some roots will accept almost any preverb.

The verb root is followed by a tense suffix.  There are five of these for each conjugation class, as shown in the following table.  (Some optional variations have been omitted.)

=== Nouns ===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Warlpiri nouns are assembled from thousands of roots, with a rich array of derivational techniques such as compounding and derivational suffixes. Plurals are formed by reduplication of the root.

=== Auxiliary word and agreement suffixes ===

Each full Warlpiri clause may contain an ''auxiliary'' word, which together with the verb suffix serves to identify tense and to clarify the relationship between main and dependent clauses.  Common auxiliaries include '''ka''' (present tense), '''kapi''' (future tense), '''kaji''' (conditional).  The auxiliary word is almost always the second word of a clause.

The auxiliary word also functions as the home for an elaborate family of suffixes that specify the person and number of the subject and object of the clause.  These are similar to the familiar conjugational suffixes that agree with the subject in Indoeuropean languages, but in Warlpiri they are placed on the auxiliary instead of on the verb, and they agree with the object as well as the subject.

An example of a suffixed auxiliary word can be seen in the farewell, '''kapirnangku nyanyi''', "I will see you."  Here, '''kapi''' indicates future tense, '''-rna''' is the suffix for first person singular subject "I", '''-ngku''' indicates second person singular object "you", and '''nyanyi''' is the nonpast form of the class 3 verb "see".

In the past tense, the auxiliary word often drops out completely.  In this case, the agreement suffixes attach instead to the first or second word of the clause, as in '''nyangurnangku''', "I saw you".

The junction where the agreement suffixes are attached can trigger progressive vowel harmony.  Thus, '''nyanyi kapingki''', "(S)he will see you", shows the vowel of the suffix '''-ngku''' (second person singular object) assimilating to the final vowel of '''kapi'''.

== Avoidance register ==

In Warlpiri culture, it is considered impolite or shameful for certain family relations to converse.  (For example, a woman should not converse with her son-in-law.) If such conversation is necessary, the speakers use a special style of the Warlpiri language called the [[avoidance speech|''avoidance register'']].  The avoidance register has the same grammar as ordinary Warlpiri, but a drastically reduced lexicon; most content words are replaced either by a generic synonym or by a word unique to the avoidance register.

== Warlpiri Sign Language ==

The Warlpiri language has a signed as well as a spoken mode. See main article [[Warlpiri Sign Language]].

'''William Spelman''' is a professor of public affairs at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]'s [[Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs]]. He is an expert on urban policy and [[criminal justice]] policy.&lt;ref name=lbj&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lbj.utexas.edu/directory/faculty/william-spelman | title=William Spelman | work=University of Texas at Austin | accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Spelman received an A.B. in political science from [[UCLA]] in 1977, an M.P.P. from [[Harvard University]]'s [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] in 1984, and a Ph.D. in public policy from [[Harvard University]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Spelman |first=William |date=1988 |title=The incapacitation benefits of selective criminal justice policies |type= |chapter= |publisher=Harvard University |docket= |oclc= |url=  https://www.worldcat.org/title/incapacitation-benefits-of-selective-criminal-justice-policies/oclc/18773915&amp;referer=brief_results |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Between 1978 and 1988, Spelman was a researcher at the [[Police Executive Research Forum]], an association of large U.S. law enforcement agencies. His work focused on the effectiveness of traditional police practices, showing among other things that fast police response only mattered in 10 percent of reported crimes.&lt;ref&gt;William Spelman and Dale K Brown, ''Calling the Police: Citizen Reporting of Serious Crime'', Police Executive Research Forum, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1984 and 1988, he was one of the principal architects (with Herman Goldstein and John E. Eck) of [[problem-oriented policing]], an alternative policing strategy that combines [[community policing]] with a [[continual improvement process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Eck | first=John E. | last2=Spelman | first2=William | title=Problem Solving: Problem-oriented Policing in Newport News | publisher=Police Executive Research Forum | date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Spelman | first=William | last2 = Eck | first2 = John E. | title=Sitting ducks, ravenous wolves, and helping hands: New approaches to urban policing | journal=Public Affairs Comment | volume=35 | issue=2 | pages=1-9 | date=Winter 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Eck | first=John E. | last2=Spelman | first2=William | date=January 1987 | title=Who ya gonna call? The police as problem-busters | journal=Crime &amp; Delinquency | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=31–52 | doi=10.1177/0011128787033001003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1988, Spelman has taught at the [[LBJ School of Public Affairs]], [[University of Texas]], where he continues research on criminal justice system effectiveness. His work on prison effectiveness is controversial. Spelman’s estimate that up to 25 percent of the [[crime drop]] of the 1990s could be attributed to prison expansion&lt;ref&gt;William Spelman, "The limited importance of prison expansion," pp 97-129 in ''The Crime Drop in America'', ed. by Alfred Blumstein and Joel Wallman, Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; has been disputed, most recently by [[Bruce Western]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Western, ''Punishment and Inequality in America'', Russell Sage Foundation, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1997 and 2005, Spelman directed the Texas Institute for Public Problem-Solving (TIPPS), a regional community policing institute funded by the [[Office of Community Oriented Policing Services]] within the [[United States Department of Justice]]. TIPPS trained 13,000 police officers and their community partners from throughout Texas on the practice of community policing, and also trained police forces in Mexico and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theiacp.org/portals/0/pdfs/COPS_factsheet.pdf | title=COPS Fact Sheet | publisher=Office of Community Oriented Policing Services | date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving on the Austin Water and Wastewater Commission for two years, Spelman served on the Austin City Council from 1997-2000, and again from 2009-2015. He is the only person ever elected to an open seat on the Austin City Council without opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theaustinbulldog.org/index.php?option=com_gmapspro2&amp;task=viewmap&amp;mapid=26&amp;controller=maps | title=Austin City Council Election 2009 | work=Austin Bulldog | accessdate = 19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a council member, Spelman balanced support for the Austin Police Department with attempts to increase police accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2014-09-12/point-austin-three-cheers-for-spelman/ | title=Three cheers for Spelman: Council member makes his final pitch for sane police spending | work=Austin Chronicle | date = 12 September 2014 | accessdate=19 August 2016 | author=King, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; His strong pro-neighborhood stance of the 1990s was tempered in the 2010s as rapid population growth increased traffic and affordability problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/spelman-faces-crowded-field-in-bid-to-regain-aus-1/nRnNQ/ | title=Spelman faces crowded field in bid to regain Austin council seat | work=Austin American-Statesman | date=29 April 2012 | accessdate=19 August 2016 | author=Toohey, Marty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2000/0131/p1s4.html | title=Where to find America's best-run cities | work=Christian Science Monitor | date=31 January 2000 | accessdate=28 May 2016 | author=Thurman, James N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Spelman conducts research in the field of criminal justice policy; specifically, it focuses on topics including [[crime prevention]], [[prison policy]], policing strategies, and [[repeat offender]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Faculty Expert Guide | publisher=LBJ School of Public Affairs | url=https://lbj.utexas.edu/news/expertguide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-campus-carry-20150604-story.html | title=Texas universities seek curbs on new law allowing concealed guns on campus | work=Los Angeles Times | date=4 June 2015 | accessdate=28 May 2016 | author=Shepherd, Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, while working for the [[Police Executive Research Forum]], he co-authored a study that found that after [[Newport News]] officials began improving the [[New Briarfield]] project and implementing a [[problem-oriented policing]] program there, the project's burglary rate dropped by 35%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=111964 | title=Problem-Solving: Problem-Oriented Policing in Newport News | work=Police Executive Research Forum | date=1987 | accessdate=28 May 2016 | author=Eck, J.E.

The system that is currently operational in the United States was created under the 1974 [[Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act]].

The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act called for a "deinstitutionalization" of [[juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquents]]. The act required that states holding youth within adult prisons for status offenses remove them within a span of two years (this timeframe was adjusted over time). The act also provided program grants to states, based on their youth populations, and created the [[Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention]] (OJJDP).

Through reauthorization amendments, additional programs have been added to the original Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. The following list highlights a few of these additions:

1975 – Programs were developed to assist children with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] who entered the juvenile justice system.

1984 – A new missing and exploited children program was added.

1984 – Strong support was given to programs that strengthened families.

1988 – Studies on prison conditions within the Indian justice system.

1990 – The OJJDP began funding [[child abuse]] training programs to instruct judicial personnel and [[prosecutor]]s.

1983 – A juvenile [[boot camp (correctional)|boot camp]] program was designed to introduce delinquent youth to a lifestyle of structure and discipline.

1992 – A community prevention grants program gave start-up money to communities for local juvenile crime prevention plans.

Some inmates of the juvenile system are or were "status offenders", children who committed acts that are not crimes for adults, but can get juveniles in trouble with the law. [[Status offense]]s include consensual sexual acts, truancy from school, smoking cigarettes, curfew violations, [[Alcohol consumption by youth in the United States|drinking alcohol]], running away from one's residence, chronic disobedience of parents, guardians, and/or other authority figures, waywardness, and ungovernability.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Vergil L.

==Trends as of 2000==
Recently, forty seven states have made it easier to be tried as an adult,&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, H., &amp; Sickmund, M. (1999). Juvenile offenders and victims: 1999 National Report.: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Page 89.&lt;/ref&gt; calling attention to the growing trend away from the original model for treatment of juveniles in the justice system. A recent study of pretrial services for youth tried as adults in 18 of the country's largest jurisdictions found that the decision to try young offenders as adults was made more often by [[legislator]]s and prosecutors (at a rate of 85%) than by judges, the people originally endowed with the responsibility for such discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildingblocksforyouth.org/ycat/ycat.html|title=Youth Crime/Adult Time: Is Justice Served?|last=Juzskiewicz|first=Jolanta|year=2000|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Building Blocks for Youth|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decreasing distinction between how youth and adults are tried in the criminal justice system has caused many within the legal system, as well as other activists and organizers, to criticize the juvenile justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/836801186|title=Juvenile justice : a text/reader|last=Craig|first=Hemmens,|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Sage Publ|isbn=1412950368|oclc=836801186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[tough on crime]]" attitudes of these recent legislative events reflect the stance's popularity in [[public opinion]]. This is true of the majority of criminal justice reform policies in the past couple decades, including [[California|California's]] infamous [[Three Strikes Law]].

Reforms in criminal justice reforms, and juvenile justice in particular, are often fought in the court of public opinion. The [[news|popular news media]] plays a crucial role in promoting the myth of a new generation of young "super-predators" threatening the public.&lt;ref name="Soler5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Soler|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite documented decreases in youth crime, particularly in violent crime which indicate a 68% decline in youth [[homicide]] in the 1990s, overall media coverage of youth crime is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dorfman|first1=Lori|last2=Schiraldi|first2=Vincent|year=2001|url=http://www.buildingblocksforyouth.org/media/media.html|title=Off Balance: Youth, Race and Crime in the News|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Building Blocks for Youth|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite evidence to the contrary, 62% of respondents in a 1999 survey on youth delinquency believed that youth crime increased.&lt;ref name="Soler5"/&gt; Advocates for juvenile justice reform focus considerable attention on amending public opinion and adjusting the gap between the threats people perceive and the reality of juvenile crime.

==Profiles of youth in custody==

A report by the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and U.S. Department of Justice, "Survey of Youth in Residential Placement: Youth's Needs and Services", used data from more than 7,000 youth in custody gathered during interviews. The report's findings include: 70% of youth in custody reported that they had "had something very bad or terrifying" happen to them in their lives. 67% reported having seen someone severely injured or killed; 26% of those surveyed said felt as if "life was not worth living", and 22% reported having tried to commit suicide at some point in their lives; 84% of the youth surveyed said they had used marijuana, compared to a rate of 30% among their peers in the general population; 30% reported having used crack or cocaine, compared with only 6% in the general population. The report noted a significant gap between the profiles of boys and girls, with girls often reporting more pronounced difficulties: 63% of girls reported having problems with anger, whereas 47% of boys did; 49% of girls reported having hallucinatory experiences, whereas only 16% of boys did; 37% of girls reported having suicidal thoughts and feelings, whereas only 18% of boys did. Facilities that treat such youth also were shown to be inadequate in some core areas, according to the Justice Department. Among youth who reported four or more recent substance-related problems, only about 60% said they had been provided with substance abuse counseling in their current facility. Many youth in custody reported having attention problems and difficulties in school. Once in custody, only 45% report spending 6 hours a day or more in school, meaning that their learning time is below that of the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/survey-youth-residential-deliquent/ |title = Survey of Youth in Residential Placement: Needs and Services |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of juvenile justice==
[[File:Juvenile crime poster LC-DIG-nclc-04935 (6288730730).jpg|thumb|upright|Juvenile crime poster, c. 1913]]
Critics of the juvenile justice system, like those in the wider [[prison abolition movement]], identify three main markers of the system for critique and reform. They hold that the juvenile justice system is unjust, ineffective, and counter-productive in terms of fulfilling the promise of the prison system, namely the protection of the public from violent offenders.

===Criticisms of racism===
Critics of the juvenile justice system believe that the system is unfairly stacked against [[minority group|minority]] youth.   Minority youth are disproportionately represented in incarcerated populations relative to their representation in the general population.  A recent report from the National Council on Crime and delinquency found that minority youth are treated more severely than white youth at every point of contact with the system—from arrest, to [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]], to [[adjudication]], to [[incarceration]]—even when charged with the same crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Poe-Yamagata |first1=Eileen |last2=Jones |first2=Michael |url=http://www.buildingblocksforyouth.org/justiceforsome/jfs.html |title=And Justice for Some: Differential Treatment of Minority Youth in the Justice System |year=2000 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Building Blocks for Youth |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412100329/http://www.buildingblocksforyouth.org/justiceforsome/jfs.html |archivedate=2009-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, [[African American]] youths made up 12% of the population, but were arrested at rates double those for [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] youths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traumaf.org/featured/5-21-04youthincarceration.html|title=Young People—Incarceration and Death at Home in the U.S.|publisher=The Trauma Foundation|year=2004|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend towards adult adjudication has had implications for the racial make-up of the juvenile prison population as well. Minority youth tried in adult courts are much more likely to be [[sentence (law)|sentenced]] to serve prison time than white youth offenders arrested for similar crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Males|first1=Mike|last2=MacAllair|first2=Dan|year=2000|url=http://www.buildingblocksforyouth.org/colorofjustice/coj.html|title=The Color of Justice|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Building Blocks for Youth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms based on adverse effects===
Juvenile detention facilities are often [[prison overcrowding|overcrowded]] and understaffed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holman|Zeidenberg|2006|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most infamous example of this trend is Cheltenham center in [[Maryland]], which at one point crowded 100 boys into cottages sanctioned for maximum capacity of 24, with only 3–4 adults supervising. Young people in these environments are subject to brutal violence from their peers as well as staff, who are often overworked, underpaid and under stress. The violence that incarcerated youth experience—fights, stabbings, [[Prison rape in the United States|rape]]s—is well known to those who work in the criminal justice system, and those who oppose it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soler|2001|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congregating delinquent youth has a negative impact on behavior—it actually serves to make them more [[deviance (sociology)|deviant]] and more of a threat to themselves and others. [[social sciences|Social scientists]] call the phenomenon "peer delinquency training", and have found significantly higher levels of [[substance abuse]], school difficulties, delinquency, violence, and adjustment difficulties in adulthood for offenders detained in congregated settings versus those that were offered treatment in another setting.&lt;ref&gt;Dishion, T.J., McCord, J &amp; Poulin F. (1999), "When interventions Harm: Peer groups and Problem Behavior." American Psychologist Vol. 54, No. 9 p. 755-764.&lt;/ref&gt;

Incarceration can aggravate [[mental disorder|mental illness]]. According to detention center administrators who testified to [[United States Congress]] in a 2004 Special Investigation by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], many incarcerated youths could have avoided incarceration had they received [[treatment of mental disorders|mental health treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Committee on Government reform,  Special Investigations Division, Minority Staff|year=2004|title=Incarceration of youth who are waiting for Community Mental Health Services in the United States|url=http://library.sprc.org/item.php?id=332&amp;catid=19}} Prepared for Sen. Susan Collins, and Rep. Henry A. Waxman.&lt;!-- Note: Direct links severed, providing link that theoretically points to real source, but doesn't right now--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Detention centers do not promote normal [[theory of cognitive development|cognitive]] and [[psychosocial development|emotional development]]. A recent report indicated that for up to one-third of incarcerated youth suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], the onset of depression occurred after their transfer to a detention center.&lt;ref&gt;Kashani, J.H., Manning, G.W., McKnew, D.H., Cytryn, L., Simonds, J.F., and Wooderson, P.C. (1980) "Depression Among Incarcerated Delinquents", Psychiatry Research Vol. 3 p. 185-191.&lt;/ref&gt; These youth face a greater risk of [[self-injury]] and [[suicide]]. Researchers have found that incarcerated youth engage in self-injurious behaviors at a rate two to four times higher than the general youth population.&lt;ref&gt;Parent, D.G., Leiter, V., Kennedy, S., Livens, L., Wentworth, D. &amp; Wilcox, S. (1994) Conditions of Confinement: Juvenile Detention and Corrections Facilities. Washington, DC: U.S. department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, prison administrative policy often intensifies the risk by responding to suicidal threats in ways that endanger the detainees, such as putting them in [[solitary confinement]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, L.M. (1999) Suicide Prevention in Juvenile Correctional Facilities Washington DC: Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.&lt;/ref&gt;

Detained youth with [[special needs]] often fail to return to school upon release. Among those young students receiving [[remedial education]] during their detention, roughly 43% do not return to school. Among those that do re-enroll, between two-thirds to three-quarters drop out within a year. Not only does this pose a serious threat to the ex-offender's well-being—high school drop-outs face high unemployment, poor health, shorter [[life expectancy|life spans]], and low income—it also poses a threat to public safety. According to the [[United States Department of Education]], high school drop-outs are 3.5 times more likely to be arrested than High School Graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holman|Zeidenberg|2006|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally incarcerated youth face less success in the [[labour economics|labor market]]. On average youth that have spent any amount of time in a youth detention facility work 3–5 weeks less than the average employee over the course of a year. Their interrupted education makes them less competitive, and their experience of incarceration may change them into less stable employees. This lack of success in the workplace is a threat to personal well-being as well as to communities whose youth are incarcerated in large numbers, such as [[African American]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holman|Zeidenberg|2006|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms based on effectiveness===
Studies indicate that incarcerating young offenders is not the most effective way of curbing delinquency and reducing crime. The relationship between detention of young offenders and the rate of overall youth criminality is not evident. A study of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s arrest data for the 1990s reveals that the rise in detention was unrelated to crime rates.  That is, detention as a tactic of controlling young offenders has little to nothing to do with the rate of crime or the "threat" that youth pose to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Sickmund, M. (2007). Juveniles in Corrections. Washington DC: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there may be an individual need to incarcerate violent or high-risk youth, most of the young people in prisons, jails and detention centers today—up to 70%—are serving time for nonviolent offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sickmund|first1=M.|last2=Sladky|first2=T.J.|last3=Kang|first3=W.|title=Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement Databook|year=2004|url=http://www.ojjdp.ncjrs.org/ojstatbb/cjrp|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all delinquent youth are incarcerated—in fact, as many as one-third of all Americans might engage in delinquent behavior at some point in their youth. But those that are detained or imprisoned are less likely to grow out of their delinquency than those that are not. [[Criminology|Criminologists]] recognize a natural process of desistance called "aging out" of delinquency, through which a person desists their delinquent behavior through [[psychosocial development|maturation]] and experience. Detaining or incarcerating youth can interrupt or slow down the aging out process, resulting in a longer period of delinquency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holman|Zeidenberg|2006|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The harm done to the emotional, mental and social development of incarcerated youth, combined with the separation from family and community and the congregation of offenders makes previous incarceration the leading indicator for a repeat offence among young offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holman|Zeidenberg|2006|pp=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a greater predictor even than weapon possession, gang membership and bad relationships with parents.&lt;ref&gt;Benda, B.B. &amp; Tollet, C.L. (1999), "A Study of Recidivism of Serious and Persistent Offenders Among Adolescents." Journal of Criminal Justice, Vol. 27, No. 2. Pages 111-126.&lt;/ref&gt; What these studies tell us is that, far from increasing the public safety and curbing youth crime, detaining and incarcerating young offenders is actually leading to more criminality among youth, and more serious crimes.

As the country grapples with the impact of a growing recession, a [[cost-benefit]] analysis of our criminal justice system is especially germane. The cost effectiveness of detention and incarceration scores very low compared with alternative approaches to youth delinquency in a [[cost-benefit analysis]]. A 2002 government commissioned study in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] revealed that for every one dollar spent on juvenile detention systems, a benefit return of $1.98 in terms of reduced crime and cost of crime to taxpayers was achieved. They found benefit returns ranging from $3.36- $13 for a series of detention alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Aos, S. (2002) The Juvenile Justice System in Washington State: recommendations to improve Cost-Effectiveness. Olympia, WA: Washington State Institute for Public Policy.&lt;/ref&gt; This study indicates that alternative models are more effective in reducing youth offending in practical and economic terms.

==The movement to end youth incarceration==
The movement to reduce and end youth incarceration is a widespread collection of thousands of activists, lawyers, [[community organizing|community organizers]], educators, artists, and youth working on specific legislative and localized initiatives.

Movement goals include shutting down particularly bad prisons and detention centers, demanding better treatment for youth in the system, providing and demanding better representation for young people in court, affecting legislation to curb youth incarceration, working to abolish [[arrest warrants]] for young people, and promoting alternatives to incarceration.

There are national organizations and local ones, opposition from inside the criminal justice system and from outside of it. The movement is diverse in many ways, and is difficult to encapsulate in a single entry. Listed below are some examples of movement struggles:

===The Maryland campaign to Close Cheltenham===

The Cheltenham Juvenile Detention Center in [[Maryland]] was one of the nation's most infamous prisons for boys. Started in 1872 as the House of Reformation for Colored Boys, Cheltenham was home to a wildly overrepresented population of [[minority group|minority youth]].  But the [[racism|racial injustice]] inside the notorious prison was not what ultimately led to its demise.

The conditions at Cheltenham were deplorable. Overcrowded and understaffed, Cheltenham was also flagged by [[fire safety]] inspectors as one of the least safe buildings in the state. The antiquated prison structure—each cell had to be individually unlocked, and at times prison staff could not present keys to some cells—was also the site of an enormous amount of brutality and violence.

Local citizens in the Maryland Juvenile Justice Coalition developed the Maryland Campaign to Close Cheltenham in 2001.  The campaign involved parents of incarcerated youth, youth activists, and faith leaders from across the state. Through a targeted media campaign to shift public opinion, the Campaign succeed in passing [[legislation]] through the annual budget to phase out and close Cheltenham, and to increase state spending on community-based alternative programs for youth offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soler|2001|pp=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taking on Tallulah===
The Tallulah Correction Center for Youth in [[Louisiana]] had been open for only three years when it was first sued by the [[United States Department of Justice]] (in collaboration with local activists in the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana) for violating the [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] of youth held in its confines—marking the first time in U.S. history that the federal government has actively sued a state over the conditions of its juvenile detention facilities.

That same year the filthy conditions, brutal violence and chronic understaffing earned the center a citation as "the worst in the nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/06/us/us-suing-louisiana-on-prison-ills.html|last=Butterfield|first=Fox|title=U.S. Suing Louisiana On Prison Ills|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=1998-11-06|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, even after the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] had taken over partial responsibility for improving conditions, things were so unsafe for the youth that the staff of the center walked out, leaving 400 boys completely unsupervised.

Youth and adult activists appealed to the [[Louisiana State Legislature|state legislature]] to shut down the prison once and for all. But their aspirations didn't stop with the [[prison abolition movement|abolition]] of one prison—they sought to redefine the juvenile justice system in the state, to change it from one based almost entirely on incarceration and punishment to a new system focusing on community-based alternatives to incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soler|2001|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the state of [[Louisiana]] became nationally recognized for its leadership in reforming a broken juvenile justice system.  With the passage of the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2003 (Act 1225), then Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] and the [[Louisiana State Legislature]] ushered in a period of reform in which the notoriously brutal Tallulah prison for youth was shut down, conditions were improved in other abusive youth prisons throughout the state, and a commitment was made to both the increased use of alternatives to incarceration for youth and to revamping secure care prisons to be small, [[therapy|therapeutic]] facilities that were regionalized to keep children closer to their families.

Before the passage of Act 1225, over two thousand children were held in prison in Louisiana. Today the system holds just over 500 children statewide. In 1998 the rate of [[recidivism]], or children returning to prison after release, was 56% as compared to 11% today. This decrease in the number of children incarcerated has contributed to an increase in [[public safety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's Happening to Our Kids: Youth in Prison|url=http://www.jjpl.org/WhatsHappeningToOurKids/YouthInPrison/youthinprison.html|publisher=Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposition 21 in California===
In 2001 [[California]] residents passed [[California Proposition 21 (2000)|Proposition 21]], a multi-faceted proposition designed to be tough on youth crime, incorporating many youth offenders into the adult criminal justice [[jurisdiction]].

Opponents to this law included activists from Californians for Justice, [[Critical Resistance]], the Youth Force Coalition, the [[Ella Baker Center for Human Rights]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. Advocates in the ACLU challenged many portions of the law, including a provision automatically sentencing youth 14–17 years old in adult court. This portion of the law was struck down by the [[California Courts of Appeal]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court Curbs New Youth Crime Law: Prosecutors lose discretion to try minors as adults|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/08/MN133525.DTL|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|last=Egelko|first=Bob|date=2001-02-08|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposing zero-tolerance policies===
The term "[[zero tolerance]]" is not defined in law or regulation; nor is there a single widely accepted practice definition. The [[United States Department of Education]], National Center for Education Statistics, defined zero tolerance as "a policy that mandates predetermined [[wikt:consequence|consequences]] or [[punishment]]s for specified [[offence (law)|offenses]]".&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;Anne J. Atkinson, Ph.D (2005)"ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES: AN ISSUE BRIEF" Prepared for the Virginia Department of Education. Richmond, VA: PolicyWorks, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of zero-tolerance policies, according to their proponents, is to send a message that certain kinds of behaviors are not tolerable on school grounds. About 94% of public schools in the United States have zero-tolerance policies for guns; 91% for other weapons; 88% for drugs; 87% for alcohol and 79% for tobacco.&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt;

Opposition to zero-tolerance policies, especially at the local level, focus on critiques including charges that the program is [[discrimination|discriminatory]], [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]], harmful to schools and students, ineptly implemented, and provides harsh punishment ([[suspension (punishment)|suspension]] of education) for minor offenses (possession of tobacco).

A few infamous cases have been used by opposition groups, such as [[Amnesty International]], to further their case against the policy. The Center for Juvenile and Criminal Justice released a story in 2003 about a 13-year-old girl in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]] arrested and detained for 5 weeks for possession of what was thought to be [[marijuana]], but turned out to be [[oregano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Young People--Incarceration and Death at Home in the U.S.|url=http://www.traumaf.org/featured/5-21-04youthincarceration.html|publisher=The Trauma Foundation|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zero-tolerance practice in Illinois of sending any youth charged with drug crimes within 1,000 feet of any school or public housing project directly to adult court has resulted in the largest racial disparity in the country—over 99% of youth affected by this policy were [[minority group|minority]] youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soler|2001|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to zero-tolerance policies nationwide and locally is broad and growing. Organizational leadership has been provided nationally by [[Amnesty International]] and the [[American Bar Association]], who has officially opposed such policies since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3985/is_200102/ai_n8948938/|title=ABA Will Oppose Zero Tolerance for Youth|publisher=Juvenile Justice Digest|date=2001-02-28|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promoting alternatives: the JDAI===
Most activists in the [[social movement|movement]] to end youth incarceration believe that the best way to mitigate the impact of detention and incarceration on our youth is to reduce the number of youth that pass through the system. By providing credible alternatives to incarceration, this portion of the movement provides opportunities for communities to treat, rather than punish, young offenders—much the way that the juvenile justice system was founded to do.

The Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI) is a [[private-public partnership]] being implemented nationwide, with pilot programs in [[California]], [[Oregon]], [[New Mexico]] and [[Illinois]]. Their goal is to make sure that locked detention is used only when absolutely necessary.  The JDAI has produced some promising results from their programs.  Detention center populations fell by between 14% and 88% in JDAI counties over the course of 7 years (1996–2003). These same counties saw declines in juvenile arrests (an indicator of overall juvenile crime rates) during the same time period ranging from 37–54%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holman|Zeidenberg|2006|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives for juvenile detention centers for rehabilitation and reentry processes for
those already incarcerated requires the work of counselors who understand the psychology of these individuals from law enforcement bodies to develop effective diversion programs are the best strategy to ensure children and youth to stay away from detention centers. Diversion programs could include everything from counseling to peer mentoring in order to improve the relationship in the community and remove the stigma of criminal youth. There are solutions proven effective for those communities that impose them. For example, intervention centers are a progressive solution where trouble kids get the opportunity to be disciplined to correct behavior but the process involves family involvement, community service activities, and one-on-one therapy. Legislation work such as Colorado's Smart School Discipline Law work to implement prevention strategies in an early stage starting in school, revise and provide adequate training to police officers in order to find proper disciplinary practice when dealing with trouble students. The initiative is now part of a bigger network to be implemented nationwide.
