The '''2006 Abule Egba pipeline explosion''' is a disaster that occurred in the heavily populated neighborhood of [[Abule Egba]] in [[Lagos]], Nigeria, on 26 December 2006, killing hundreds of people. There were originally believed to be around 500 deaths, but it was later confirmed that the loss was smaller.

The incident occurred after an elevated [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] carrying petroleum products was punctured by thieves&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;{{cite news | last =Zhang | first =Linda  | title =Nigerian Pipeline Blast Spurs UN Call for Fuel Management Review | work = International Business Times | date =29 December 2006 | url = http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20061229/nigeria-oil-explosion-un.htm | accessdate =1 January 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  earlier at midnight (local time), attracting hundreds of scavengers in the district who collected the fuel using plastic containers, allegedly to siphon fuel into a tanker,&lt;ref name="Zhang"/&gt; before puddles of fallen fuel were ignited after dawn.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/12/26/nigeria.blast.ap/index.html |title=200 dead in Nigeria pipeline blast, Red Cross confirms |publisher=[[CNN]], originally [[Associated Press]] |date=26 December 2006 |accessdate=26 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102080252/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/12/26/nigeria.blast.ap/index.html |archivedate=2 January 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of the explosion remains unknown, while witnesses have stated that the broken pipeline was tapped when the blast occurred.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

The number of people killed is unclear, but is evidenced to be in the hundreds. Abiodun Orebiyi, the secretary-general of the Nigerian [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] (NRC), estimated that there were at least 200 dead but indicated that there was no official death toll and was unable to determine the final number of deaths, stating that the NRC "[doesn't] know if it is 300, 400 or 500".&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=newsOne&amp;storyID=2006-12-26T153237Z_01_L26344713_RTRUKOC_0_US-NIGERIA-FIRE.xml&amp;WTmodLoc=Home-C2-TopNews-newsOne-6 |title=Up to 500 killed in Lagos fuel blast |agency=Reuters |date=26 December 2006 |accessdate=29 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216050529/http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=newsOne |archive-date=16 February 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also added that 60 people had been taken to the hospital with serious burns,&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; while a number of houses had been destroyed, along with a mosque and a church.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt; Another senior official, Ige Oladimeji, was quoted as saying that there has been 260 documented to be dead by nightfall.&lt;ref name="skynews"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-13559365,00.html | title= Hundreds Die In Nigeria Pipeline Blast | publisher=[[Sky News]] |date=26 December 2006 | accessdate=29 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the explosion, a [[Reuters]] news agency photographer estimated 500 bodies in the scene.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6209845.stm | title= Lagos pipeline blast kills scores |publisher=BBC News |date=26 December 2006 | accessdate=26 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 Magnolia Refinery [[oil spill]] occurred on March 9, 2013, when the line between a vital [[pump]] and an [[oil storage|oil storage container]] broke. The split allowed a reported 15,000 [[barrels]] (1,788  m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) or 7,000 tonnes of crude oil into the Little Corney Creek. The creek runs towards the town of [[Magnolia, Arkansas]]. The resulting oil slick was approximately {{convert|1.5|mi}} long on the surface of the water, about {{convert|20|mi}} north of the [[Louisiana]] state border. The leak was located at the Lion Oil and Trading &amp; Transportation's Oil tank farm, between the settlements of [[Magnolia, Arkansas|Magnolia]] and [[El Dorado, Arkansas|El Dorado]], owned by Delek's Logistic Unit. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) classified this pipeline rupture as a major spill because of the number of barrels estimated to have been spilled.

== Geography ==
The city of Magnolia is in [[Columbia County, Arkansas]], United States and is the county seat of the county. According to the 2009 [[U.S. Census Bureau]] reports, the population of the city is 10,951. The city itself has an approximate area of {{convert|9.344|sqmi}}.

== Response ==
Local authorities were called to action and responded quickly to clean up the spill and monitor the damage. Cleanup workers made use of a "[[vacuum truck]]", a vehicle used to suck up the oil and water from the creek quickly before making efforts to separate the two liquids. This process was employed to minimize environmental damage to the local shorelines. Beginning oil removal as fast as possible is beneficial to the overall results of the cleanup process. The farther into the environment that the oil seeps, the longer it will take to remove and the more integrated it will become into the food chain, becoming inaccessible.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) was vital too in the cleanup process at [[Magnolia, Arkansas]] after this oil spill. Low temperatures and inclement weather initially delayed the cleanup procedures, but the EPA was eventually able to send out crews to various locations within the affected area.

== Result ==
Delek was required to pay for all cleanup operations after the spill and if the logistics unit corporation is confirmed to be guilty of negligence, for which they be fined accordingly.

'''Aircraft fuel tanks''' are a major component of [[aircraft fuel system]]s. They can be classified into internal or external tanks and further classified by method of construction or intended use. Safety aspects of aircraft fuel tanks were examined during the investigation of the 1996 [[TWA Flight 800]] in-flight explosion accident.

==Internal tanks==

===Integral tanks===
{{Main|Wet wing}}
Integral tanks are areas inside the aircraft structure that have been sealed to allow fuel storage. An example of this type is the "[[wet wing]]" commonly used in larger aircraft. Since these tanks are part of the aircraft structure, they cannot be removed for service or inspection. Inspection panels must be provided to allow internal inspection, repair, and overall servicing of the tank. Most large transport aircraft use this system, storing fuel in the wings, [[fuselage]], and [[empennage]] of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="Whitford153"&gt;Whitford 2004, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rigid removable tanks===
{{Main|Self-sealing fuel tank}}
Rigid removable tanks are installed in a compartment designed to accommodate the tank. They are typically of metal, plastic or [[fibreglass]] construction, and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair.&lt;ref&gt;FAA 1988, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft does not rely on the tank for structural integrity. These tanks are commonly found in smaller general aviation aircraft, such as the [[Cessna 172]]. Combat aircraft and helicopters generally use [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s.&lt;ref name="Whitford153"/&gt;

===Bladder tanks===
Bladder tanks, bag tanks or fuel cells, are reinforced rubberised bags installed in a section of aircraft structure designed to accommodate fuel. The bladder is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of snap fasteners or cord and loops inside the compartment. Many high-performance light aircraft, [[helicopter]]s and some smaller [[turboprop]] aircraft use bladder tanks.&lt;ref name="Whitford153"/&gt;

===Tip tanks===
Many aircraft designs feature fixed tip tanks mounted at [[Wing tip|the end of each wing]]. The weight of the tanks and fuel counteract wing bending loads during manoeuvres and reduce [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] on the [[Spar (aeronautics)|spar]] structure.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

==External tanks==
{{Main|Conformal fuel tank|Drop tank}}
[[File:AIM-4 and AIM-7 on F-4E.jpg|thumb|[[F-4E Phantom]] carrying two underwing pylon tanks and a centreline tank]]

===Conformal fuel tank===
Conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) or 'Fast Packs' are additional fuel tanks fitted closely to the profile of an aircraft which extend either the range or endurance of the aircraft, with a reduced [[Drag (physics)|aerodynamic penalty]] compared to external drop tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Whitford 2004, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drop tank===
Drop tanks, external tanks, wing tanks, pylon tanks or belly tanks are all terms used to describe auxiliary externally mounted fuel tanks. Drop tanks are generally expendable and often jettisonable. External tanks are commonplace on modern [[military aircraft]] and occasionally found in [[civilian]] ones, although the latter are less likely to be discarded except in the event of emergency.&lt;ref name="Whitford153"/&gt;

Drop tanks were originally designed to be jettisoned when empty or in the event of combat or emergency in order to reduce drag and weight, increasing manoeuvrability and range. Modern external tanks may be retained in combat, to be dropped in an emergency and are often not designed for the stresses of [[supersonic]] flight.&lt;ref name="Whitford153"/&gt;

==Safety==
{{See also|TWA Flight 800|Inerting system}}

Fuel tanks have been implicated in [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aviation disasters]], being the cause of the accident or worsening it (fuel tank [[explosion]]).

The official explanation for the explosion and subsequent crash of [[TWA Flight 800]] is that an explosive fuel/air mixture was created in one of the aircraft's fuel tanks. Faulty wiring then provided an ignition source within the tank, destroying the airliner.&lt;ref&gt;NTSB p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; While the accuracy of the official findings is still questioned in this case, similar explosions have occurred in other aircraft. It is possible to reduce the chance of fuel tank explosions by a [[Inerting system|fuel tank inerting system]] or [[fire fighting foam]] in the tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Whitford 2004, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5715">The '''Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund''' ('''BCCRF''') is a multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) created to collect and disburse climate adaptation funding for [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alam |first1=Khurshid |last2=Shamsuddoha |first2=Md |last3=Tanner |first3=Thomas |last4=Sultana |first4=Moshahida |last5=Huq |first5=Muhammad Jahedul |last6=Kabir |first6=Sumaiya S. |date=May 2011 |title=The Political Economy of Climate Resilient Development Planning in Bangladesh |journal=IDS Bulletin |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=52–61 |doi=10.1111/j.1759-5436.2011.00222.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 2009, the Bangladeshi government refused to accept a £60m climate funding offer from the [[United Kingdom]] if it was channelled through the World Bank.&lt;ref name="guardian-20100215"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh rejects £60m of climate aid from UK |date=15 February 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/15/bangladesh-world-bank-climate-finance |publisher=Guardian |author=David Adam and John Vidal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
According to Mohammed Shamsuddoha and Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, "The 'draft [[concept note]]' prepared by the government of Bangladesh on the MDTF suggested that the secretariat be based in the World Bank office in Dhaka. The Bank would co-chair the management committee, and administer, manage, supervise and monitor implementation of the MDTF's projects and programmes. For this job, the Bank will charge a fee of $8 million. All implementing agencies will have to follow the Bank's guidelines and policies on project implementation and procurement."&lt;ref name="brettonwoods"&gt;{{cite web |title=Unjustifiable Bank domination over climate funds in Bangladesh |author=Mohammed Shamsuddoha and Rezaul Karim Chowdhury |date=20 November 2009| url=http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/art-565619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
The British [[Department for International Development]] (DFID) has been insisting that climate finance should be channeled through a Multi Donor Trust Fund managed by the World Bank; this position has been supported by the Danish government.&lt;ref name="guardian-20100215" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newage-20090313"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2009/mar/13/edit.html |title=WB's fingers in Bangladesh's climate fund pie |author=Mahtab Haider |newspaper=New Age |date=March 13, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference, a Bangladeshi delegate told reporters that Bangladesh might let the World Bank manage the funds, if that was set as a condition by funders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh demands allocation of funds for population at risk |date=December 13, 2009 |url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Asia/Story/A1Story20091213-185611.html |newspaper=Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the conference, Bangladeshi Prime Minister [[Sheikh Hasina]] stated that establishing a Multi Donor Trust Fund is part of her government's response to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=February 2, 2010 |url=http://bssnews.net/newsDetails.php?cat=7&amp;id=85485$date=2010-01-27&amp;dateCurrent=2010-02-02
|title=Getting recognition as MVC major success of Bangladesh in COP 15, PM tells JS |publisher=Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
According to the ''[[New Age (Bangladesh)|New Age]]'', the Multi Donor Trust Fund has "more or less unanimous opposition among climate change researchers, environment ministry officials and NGOs and civil society members in Bangladesh alike."&lt;ref name="newage-20090313" /&gt; Bangladeshi civil society organizations are strongly critical of the Multi Donor Trust Fund idea, generally preferring that funds be managed by a state-run board. Campaigners have expressed concern about the 10-15% management fees to be charged by World Bank consultants, and lack of democratic access to adaptation funding. Other campaigners are strongly critical of World Bank-funded projects, which they say "have often created ecological hazards and destroyed ecological goods and services."&lt;ref name="brettonwoods"&gt;{{cite web |title=Unjustifiable Bank domination over climate funds in Bangladesh |author=Mohammed Shamsuddoha and Rezaul Karim Chowdhury |date=20 November 2009| url=http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/art-565619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Water salinity}}

'''Brine''' is a high-concentration [[solution]] of [[salt]] (usually [[sodium chloride]]) in [[water]].  In different contexts, brine may refer to salt solutions ranging from about 3.5% (a typical concentration of [[seawater]], on the lower end of solutions used for [[brining]] foods) up to about 26% (a typical [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] solution, depending on temperature). Lower levels of concentration are called by different names: [[fresh water]], [[brackish water]], and [[saline water]].

Brine naturally occurs on Earth's surface ([[salt lake]]s), crust, and within [[brine pool]]s on ocean bottom. High-concentration brine lakes typically emerge due to [[evaporation]] of ground saline water on high ambient temperatures. Brine is used for food processing and cooking ([[pickling]] and [[brining]]), for [[de-icing]] of roads and other structures, and in a number of technological processes. It is also a by-product of many [[industrial process]]es, such as [[desalination]], and may pose an environmental risk due to its corrosive and toxic effects, so it requires [[wastewater treatment]] for proper disposal.

==In nature==
{{main|Saline water}}
[[File:Brine concentration measurement.jpg|thumb|upright|A NASA technician measures the concentration level of brine using a [[hydrometer]] at a [[salt evaporation pond]] in San Francisco.]]
[[Saline water]] with relatively high concentration of salt (usually [[sodium chloride]]) occurs naturally on Earth's surface ([[salt lake]]s), crust, and within [[brine pool]]s on ocean bottom.

Numerous processes exist which can produce brines in nature. Modification of seawater via evaporation results in the concentration of salts in the residual fluid, a characteristic geologic deposit called an [[evaporite]] is formed as different dissolved ions reach the saturation states of minerals, typically [[gypsum]] and [[halite]]. A similar process occurs at high latitudes as seawater freezes resulting in a fluid termed a cryogenic brine. At the time of formation, these cryogenic brines are by definition cooler than the freezing temperature of seawater and can produce a feature called a [[brinicle]] where cool brines descend, freezing the surrounding seawater.

The brine cropping out at the surface as saltwater springs are known as "licks" or "salines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Scioto Saline-Ohio's Early Salt Industry |url=http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Portals/10/pdf/GeoFacts/geof07.pdf |publisher=dnr.state.oh.us |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007153134/http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Portals/10/pdf/GeoFacts/geof07.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of dissolved solids in [[groundwater]] vary highly from one location to another on Earth, both in terms of specific constituents (e.g. halite, [[anhydrite]], [[carbonate]]s, gypsum, [[fluoride]]-salts, [[organic halide]]s, and [[sulfate]]-salts) and regarding the concentration level. Using one of several classification of groundwater based on [[total dissolved solids]] (TDS), brine is water containing more than 100,000&amp;nbsp;mg/L TDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Overview of Saline Groundwater Occurrence and Genesis |url=http://www.igrac.net/dynamics/modules/SFIL0100/view.php?fil_Id=135 |publisher=igrac.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brine is commonly produced during well completion operations, particularly after the [[hydraulic fracturing]] of a well.

==Uses==
===Culinary===
{{main|Brining}}
Brine is a common agent in [[food processing]] and cooking. Brining is used to [[Food preservation|preserve]] or [[seasoning|season]] the food. Brining can be applied to [[vegetable]]s, [[cheese]]s and [[fruit]] in a process known as [[pickling]]. [[Meat]] and [[fish]] are typically [[steeping|steeped]] in brine for shorter periods of time, as a form of [[marination]], enhancing its [[meat tenderness|tenderness]] and [[flavor]], or to enhance shelf period.
===Chlorine production===
{{main|Chlorine production}}
Elemental chlorine can be produced by [[electrolysis]] of brine ([[NaCl]] solution). This process also produces [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) and [[Hydrogen]] gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The reaction equations are as follows:

* Cathode: &lt;chem&gt;2 H+ + 2 e- -&gt; H2 (^)&lt;/chem&gt;
* Anode: &lt;chem&gt;2 Cl- -&gt; Cl2 (^) + 2 e-&lt;/chem&gt;
* Overall process: &lt;chem&gt;2 NaCl + 2 H2O -&gt; Cl2 + H2 + 2 NaOH&lt;/chem&gt;

===Refrigerating fluid===&lt;!--[[Brine (refrigerant)]] redirects here--&gt;
Brine is used as a secondary [[fluid]] in large refrigeration installations for the transport of [[thermal energy]] from place to place. Most commonly used brines are based on inexpensive [[calcium chloride]] and [[sodium chloride]].&lt;ref name=Cool-Info&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cool-info.co.uk/brines_steam/secondary_refrigerants/sec_refrig01.html |title= Secondary Refrigerant Systems |work= Cool-Info.com |accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used because the addition of salt to water lowers the freezing temperature of the solution and the heat transport efficiency can be greatly enhanced for the comparatively low cost of the material. The lowest freezing point obtainable for NaCl brine is {{convert|−21.1|C}} at the concentration of 23.3% NaCl by weight.&lt;ref name=Cool-Info/&gt; This is called the [[eutectic]] point.

Sodium chloride brine spray is used on some fishing vessels to freeze fish.&lt;ref name=fish&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://seafood.oregonstate.edu/.pdf%20Links/Planning-for-Seafood-Freezing.pdf |title= Planning forSeafood Freezing |first1= Edward |last1= Kolbe |first2= Donald |last2= Kramer |work= Alaska Sea Grant College Program [[Oregon State University]] |date= 2007 |ISBN= 1566121191 |accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brine temperature is generally {{convert|-5|F|C}}. Air blast freezing temperatures are {{convert|-31|F|C}} or lower. Given the higher temperature of brine, the system efficiency over air blast freezing can be higher. High-value fish usually are frozen at much lower temperatures, below the practical temperature limit for brine.

Because of the corrosive properties of salt-based brines, [[diol|glycols]] such as [[polyethylene glycol]] have become more common for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.accent-refrigeration.com/tips/design-tips/calcium-chloride-versus-glycol |title= Calcium Chloride versus Glycol |work= accent-refrigeration.com |accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water softening and purification===
Brine is an auxiliary agent in [[water softening]] and [[water purification]] systems involving [[ion exchange]] technology. The most common example are household [[dishwasher]]s, utilizing natrium chloride in form of [[dishwasher salt]]. Brine is not involved in the purification process itself, but used for regeneration of [[ion-exchange resin]] on cyclical basis. The water being treated flows through the resin container until the resin is considered exhausted and water is purified to a desired level. Resin is then regenerated by sequentially backwashing the resin bed to remove accumulated solids, flushing removed ions from the resin with a concentrated solution of replacement ions, and rinsing the flushing solution from the resin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=The NALCO Water Handbook |editor-last=Kemmer |editor-first=Frank N. |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1979 |pages=12-7; 12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After treatment, ion-exchange resin beads saturated with [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] ions from the treated water, are regenerated by soaking in brine containing 6–12% NaCl. The [[sodium]] ions from brine replace the calcium and magnesium ions on the beads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/triple_aqa/water/hard_soft_water/revision/4/ |title= Hard and soft water |website=GCSE Bitesize |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SenGupta2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arup K. SenGupta|title=Ion Exchange and Solvent Extraction: A Series of Advances|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hf4sYJfDYm8C&amp;pg=PA125|date=19 April 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-5540-9|pages=125–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De-icing===
In lower temperatures, a brine solution can be used to [[snow removal|de-ice]] or reduce freezing temperatures on roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usroads.com/journals/rmj/9702/rm970202.htm|title=Prewetting with Salt Brine for More Effective Roadway Deicing|website=www.usroads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wastewater==
{{main|Industrial wastewater treatment#Brine treatment}}
Brine is a byproduct of many industrial processes, such as [[desalination]] for human consumption and irrigation, power plant [[cooling tower]]s, [[produced water]] from oil and [[natural gas]] extraction, [[Acid mine drainage|acid mine or acid rock drainage]], [[reverse osmosis]] reject, [[Chloralkali process|chlor-alkali]] wastewater treatment, pulp and paper mill effluent, and waste streams from food and beverage processing. Along with diluted salts, it can contain residues of pretreatment and cleaning chemicals, their reaction byproducts and heavy metals due to corrosion. 

Wastewater brine can pose a significant environmental hazard, both due to corrosive and sediment-forming effects of salts and toxicity of other chemicals diluted in it. It must be properly disposed, which may require permits and compliance with environmental regulations.&lt;ref name=Desalitech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desalitech.com/7-ways-to-dispose-of-brine-waste/ |title=7 Ways to Dispose of Brine Waste |publisher=Desalitech |access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The simplest way to dispose of unpolluted brine from desalination plants and cooling towers is to return it back to the ocean. To limit the environmental impact, it can be diluted with another stream of water, such as the outfall of a [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] or power plant. Since brine is heavier than seawater and would accumulate on the ocean bottom, it requires methods to ensure proper diffusion, such as installing underwater [[diffuser (sewage)|diffusers]] in the [[sewerage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/processes/desalination/brine/general/brine-disposal.htm |title=Reverse Osmosis Desalination: Brine disposal |publisher=Lenntech |access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods include drying in [[evaporation pond]]s, injecting to deep wells, and storing and reusing the brine for irrigation, de-icing or dust control purposes.&lt;ref name=Desalitech/&gt;

Technologies for treatment of polluted brine include: membrane filtration processes, such as [[reverse osmosis]]; ion exchange processes such as [[electrodialysis]] or [[Ion-exchange resin|weak acid cation exchange]]; or evaporation processes, such as brine concentrators and [[Crystallization#Evaporative crystallizers|crystallizers]] employing [[mechanical vapour recompression]] and steam.

[[Image:Buoyancy.svg|thumb|The forces at work in buoyancy. The object floats at rest because the upward force of buoyancy is equal to the downward force of [[Gravitation|gravity]].]]

In [[physics]], '''buoyancy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔɪ|.|ə|n|s|i|,_|ˈ|b|uː|j|ə|n|-}})&lt;ref name="lpd"&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cepd"&gt;{{citation|last=Roach|first=Peter|year=2011|title=Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary|edition=18th|place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521152532}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''upthrust''', is an upward [[force]] exerted by a [[fluid]] that opposes the [[weight]] of an immersed object. In a column of fluid, pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the overlying fluid. Thus the pressure at the bottom of a column of fluid is greater than at the top of the column. Similarly, the pressure at the bottom of an object submerged in a fluid is greater than at the top of the object. This pressure difference results in a net upward force on the object. The magnitude of that force exerted is proportional to that pressure difference, and (as explained by [[Archimedes' principle]]) is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the volume of the object, i.e. the [[Displacement (fluid)|displaced]] fluid.

For this reason, an object whose [[density]] is greater than that of the fluid in which it is submerged tends to sink. If the object is either less dense than the liquid or is shaped appropriately (as in a boat), the force can keep the object afloat. This can occur only in a [[non-inertial reference frame]], which either has a [[gravitational field]] or is [[acceleration|accelerating due to a force other than gravity]] defining a "downward" direction. In a situation of fluid statics, the net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid displaced by the body.&lt;ref&gt;Note: In the absence of surface tension, the mass of fluid displaced is equal to the submerged volume multiplied by the fluid density. High repulsive surface tension will cause the body to float higher than expected, though the same total volume will be displaced, but at a greater distance from the object. Where there is doubt about the meaning of "volume of fluid displaced", this should be interpreted as the overflow from a full container when the object is floated in it, or as the volume of the object below the average level of the fluid.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''center of buoyancy''' of an object is the [[centroid]] of the displaced volume of fluid.

==Archimedes' principle==
[[Image:Pound-coin-floating-in-mercury.jpg|right|thumb|A metallic coin (an old British [[British one pound coin|pound coin]]) floats in [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] due to the buoyancy force upon it and appears to float higher because of the [[surface tension]] of the mercury.]]

{{Main|Archimedes' principle}}
[[File:04. Галилеево топче.ogv|thumb|right|260px|The Galileo's Ball experiment, showing the different buoyancy of the same object, depending on its surrounding medium. The ball has certain buoyancy in [[water]], but once [[ethanol]] is added (which is less dense than water), it reduces the density of the medium, thus making the ball sink further down (reducing its buoyancy).]]

Archimedes' principle is named after [[Archimedes]] of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], who first discovered this law in 212 B.C.&lt;ref name=acottLaw&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Acott, Chris |title=The diving "Law-ers": A brief resume of their lives. |journal=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal]] |volume=29 |issue=1 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5990 |accessdate=2009-06-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402073203/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5990 |archivedate=2 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; For objects, floating and sunken, and in gases as well as liquids (i.e. a [[fluid]]), Archimedes' principle may be stated thus in terms of forces:

{{Quotation|Any object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object}}
— with the clarifications that for a sunken object the volume of displaced fluid is the volume of the object, and for a floating object on a liquid, the weight of the displaced liquid is the weight of the object.

More tersely: '''Buoyancy = weight of displaced fluid.'''

Archimedes' principle does not consider the [[surface tension]] (capillarity) acting on the body,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.weizmann.ac.il/home/fnfal/papers/Natfloat.pdf |title=Floater clustering in a standing wave: Capillarity effects drive hydrophilic or hydrophobic particles to congregate at specific points on a wave |date=23 June 2005 |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721142904/http://www.weizmann.ac.il/home/fnfal/papers/Natfloat.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this additional force modifies only the amount of fluid displaced and [[Meniscus (liquid)|the spatial distribution of the displacement]], so the principle that ''Buoyancy = weight of displaced fluid'' remains valid.

The weight of the displaced fluid is directly proportional to the volume of the displaced fluid (if the surrounding fluid is of uniform density). In simple terms, the principle states that the buoyancy force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, or the density of the fluid multiplied by the submerged volume times the gravitational acceleration, g. Thus, among completely submerged objects with equal masses, objects with greater volume have greater buoyancy. This is also known as upthrust.

Suppose a rock's weight is measured as 10 [[Newton (unit)|newton]]s when suspended by a string in a [[vacuum]] with gravity acting upon it. Suppose that when the rock is lowered into water, it displaces water of weight 3 newtons. The force it then exerts on the string from which it hangs would be 10 newtons minus the 3 newtons of buoyancy force: 10&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3 = 7 newtons. Buoyancy reduces the apparent weight of objects that have sunk completely to the sea floor. It is generally easier to lift an object up through the water than it is to pull it out of the water.

Assuming Archimedes' principle to be reformulated as follows,
:&lt;math&gt;\text{apparent immersed weight} = \text{weight} - \text{weight of displaced fluid}\,&lt;/math&gt;

then inserted into the quotient of weights, which has been expanded by the mutual volume

:&lt;math&gt; \frac { \text{density}} { \text{density of fluid} } = \frac { \text{weight}} { \text{weight of displaced fluid} }, \,&lt;/math&gt;

yields the formula below. The density of the immersed object relative to the density of the fluid can easily be calculated without measuring any volumes.:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac { \text {density of object}} { \text{density of fluid} } = \frac { \text{weight}} { \text{weight} - \text{apparent immersed weight}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

(This formula is used for example in describing the measuring principle of a [[dasymeter]] and of [[hydrostatic weighing]].)

Example: If you drop wood into water, buoyancy will keep it afloat.

Example: A helium balloon in a moving car. During a period of increasing speed, the air mass inside the car moves in the direction opposite to the car's acceleration (i.e., towards the rear). The balloon is also pulled this way.  However, because the balloon is buoyant relative to the air, it ends up being pushed "out of the way", and will actually drift in the same direction as the car's acceleration (i.e., forward).  If the car slows down, the same balloon will begin to drift backward.  For the same reason, as the car goes round a curve, the balloon will drift towards the inside of the curve.

==Forces and equilibrium==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
The equation to calculate the pressure inside a fluid in equilibrium is:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{f}+\operatorname{div}\,\sigma=0&lt;/math&gt;

where '''f''' is the force density exerted by some outer field on the fluid, and ''σ'' is the [[Cauchy stress tensor]]. In this case the stress tensor is proportional to the identity tensor:

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}=-p\delta_{ij}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]]. Using this the above equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{f}=\nabla p.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the outer force field is conservative, that is it can be written as the negative gradient of some scalar valued function:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}=-\nabla\Phi.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla(p+\Phi)=0 \Longrightarrow p+\Phi = \text{constant}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the shape of the open surface of a fluid equals the equipotential plane of the applied outer conservative force field. Let the ''z''-axis point downward. In this case the field is gravity, so Φ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''ρ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;gz'' where ''g'' is the gravitational acceleration, ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mass density of the fluid. Taking the pressure as zero at the surface, where ''z'' is zero, the constant will be zero, so the pressure inside the fluid, when it is subject to gravity, is

:&lt;math&gt;p=\rho_f g z.\,&lt;/math&gt;

So pressure increases with depth below the surface of a liquid, as ''z'' denotes the distance from the surface of the liquid into it. Any object with a non-zero vertical depth will have different pressures on its top and bottom, with the pressure on the bottom being greater. This difference in pressure causes the upward buoyancy force.

The buoyancy force exerted on a body can now be calculated easily, since the internal pressure of the fluid is known. The force exerted on the body can be calculated by integrating the stress tensor over the surface of the body which is in contact with the fluid:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}=\oint \sigma \, d\mathbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

The surface integral can be transformed into a volume integral with the help of the [[Gauss theorem]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}=\int \operatorname{div}\sigma \, dV = -\int \mathbf{f}\, dV = -\rho_f \mathbf{g} \int\,dV=-\rho_f \mathbf{g} V&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is the measure of the volume in contact with the fluid, that is the volume of the submerged part of the body, since the fluid doesn't exert force on the part of the body which is outside of it.

The magnitude of buoyancy force may be appreciated a bit more from the following argument. Consider any object of arbitrary shape and volume ''V'' surrounded by a liquid. The [[force]] the liquid exerts on an object within the liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid with a volume equal to that of the object. This force is applied in a direction opposite to gravitational force, that is of magnitude:

:&lt;math&gt;B = \rho_f V_\text{disp}\, g, \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[density]] of the fluid, ''V&lt;sub&gt;disp&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the volume of the displaced body of liquid, and ''g'' is the [[gravitational acceleration]] at the location in question.

If this volume of liquid is replaced by a solid body of exactly the same shape, the force the liquid exerts on it must be exactly the same as above. In other words, the "buoyancy force" on a submerged body is directed in the opposite direction to gravity and is equal in magnitude to

:&lt;math&gt;B = \rho_f V g. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[net force]] on the object must be zero if it is to be a situation of fluid statics such that Archimedes principle is applicable, and is thus the sum of the buoyancy force and the object's weight

:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{net} = 0 = m g - \rho_f V_\text{disp} g \,&lt;/math&gt;

If the buoyancy of an (unrestrained and unpowered) object exceeds its weight, it tends to rise. An object whose weight exceeds its buoyancy tends to sink. Calculation of the upwards force on a submerged object during its [[acceleration|accelerating]] period cannot be done by the Archimedes principle alone; it is necessary to consider dynamics of an object involving buoyancy. Once it fully sinks to the floor of the fluid or rises to the surface and settles, Archimedes principle can be applied alone. For a floating object, only the submerged volume displaces water. For a sunken object, the entire volume displaces water, and there will be an additional force of reaction from the solid floor.

In order for Archimedes' principle to be used alone, the object in question must be in equilibrium (the sum of the forces on the object must be zero), therefore;

:&lt;math&gt;mg = \rho_f V_\text{disp} g, \,&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;m = \rho_f V_\text{disp}.  \,&lt;/math&gt;

showing that the depth to which a floating object will sink, and the volume of fluid it will displace, is independent of the [[gravitational field]] regardless of geographic location.
:(''Note: If the fluid in question is [[seawater]], it will not have the same [[density]] (''&amp;rho;'') at every location. For this reason, a ship may display a [[Waterline#Load line|Plimsoll line]].)''

It can be the case that forces other than just buoyancy and gravity come into play. This is the case if the object is restrained or if the object sinks to the solid floor. An object which tends to float requires a [[tension (physics)|tension]] restraint force T in order to remain fully submerged. An object which tends to sink will eventually have a [[normal force]] of constraint N exerted upon it by the solid floor. The constraint force can be tension in a spring scale measuring its weight in the fluid, and is how apparent weight is defined.

If the object would otherwise float, the tension to restrain it fully submerged is:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \rho_f V g - m g . \,&lt;/math&gt;

When a sinking object settles on the solid floor, it experiences a [[normal force]] of:

:&lt;math&gt;N = m g - \rho_f V g . \,&lt;/math&gt;

Another possible formula for calculating buoyancy of an object is by finding the apparent weight of that particular object in the air (calculated in Newtons), and apparent weight of that object in the water (in Newtons). To find the force of buoyancy acting on the object when in air, using this particular information, this formula applies:

: '''Buoyancy force = weight of object in empty space − weight of object immersed in fluid'''

The final result would be measured in Newtons.

Air's density is very small compared to most solids and liquids. For this reason, the weight of an object in air is approximately the same as its true weight in a vacuum. The buoyancy of air is neglected for most objects during a measurement in air because the error is usually insignificant (typically less than 0.1% except for objects of very low average density such as a balloon or light foam).

===Simplified model===
[[File:Pressure distribution on an immersed cube.png|thumb|Pressure distribution on an immersed cube]]
[[File:Forces on an immersed cube.png|thumb|Forces on an immersed cube]]
[[File:Approximation of an arbitrary volume as a group of cubes.png|thumb|Approximation of an arbitrary volume as a group of cubes]]

A simplified explanation for the integration of the pressure over the contact area may be stated as follows:

Consider a cube immersed in a fluid with the upper surface horizontal.

The sides are identical in area, and have the same depth distribution, therefore they also have the same pressure distribution, and consequently the same total force resulting from hydrostatic pressure, exerted perpendicular to the plane of the surface of each side.

There are two pairs of opposing sides, therefore the resultant horizontal forces balance in both orthogonal directions, and the resultant force is zero.

The upward force on the cube is the pressure on the bottom surface integrated over its area. The surface is at constant depth, so the pressure is constant. Therefore, the integral of the pressure over the area of the horizontal bottom surface of the cube is the hydrostatic pressure at that depth multiplied by the area of the bottom surface.

Similarly, the downward force on the cube is the pressure on the top surface integrated over its area. The surface is at constant depth, so the pressure is constant. Therefore, the integral of the pressure over the area of the horizontal top surface of the cube is the hydrostatic pressure at that depth multiplied by the area of the top surface.

As this is a cube, the top and bottom surfaces are identical in shape and area, and the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the cube is directly proportional to the depth difference, and the resultant force difference is exactly equal to the weight of the fluid that would occupy the volume of the cube in its absence.

This means that the resultant upward force on the cube is equal to the weight of the fluid that would fit into the volume of the cube, and the downward force on the cube is its weight, in the absence of external forces.

This analogy is valid for variations in the size of the cube.

If two cubes are placed alongside each other with a face of each in contact, the pressures and resultant forces on the sides or parts thereof in contact are balanced and may be disregarded, as the contact surfaces are equal in shape, size and pressure distribution, therefore the buoyancy of two cubes in contact is the sum of the buoyancies of each cube. This analogy can be extended to an arbitrary number of cubes.

An object of any shape can be approximated as a group of cubes in contact with each other, and as the size of the cube is decreased, the precision of the approximation increases. The limiting case for infinitely small cubes is the exact equivalence.

Angled surfaces do not nullify the analogy as the resultant force can be split into orthogonal components and each dealt with in the same way.

===Static stability===
{{main|Ship stability}}
[[File:ship stability.svg|thumb|Illustration of the stability of bottom-heavy (left) and top-heavy (right) ships with respect to the positions of their centres of buoyancy (CB) and gravity (CG)]]
A floating object is stable if it tends to restore itself to an equilibrium position after a small displacement. For example, floating objects will generally have vertical stability, as if the object is pushed down slightly, this will create a greater buoyancy force, which, unbalanced by the weight force, will push the object back up.

Rotational stability is of great importance to floating vessels. Given a small angular displacement, the vessel may return to its original position (stable), move away from its original position (unstable), or remain where it is (neutral).

Rotational stability depends on the relative lines of action of forces on an object. The upward buoyancy force on an object acts through the center of buoyancy, being the [[centroid]] of the displaced volume of fluid. The weight force on the object acts through its [[Center of mass|center of gravity]]. A buoyant object will be stable if the center of gravity is beneath the center of buoyancy because any angular displacement will then produce a 'righting [[moment (physics)|moment]]'.

The stability of a buoyant object at the surface is more complex, and it may remain stable even if the centre of gravity is above the centre of buoyancy, provided that when disturbed from the equilibrium position, the centre of buoyancy moves further to the same side that the centre of gravity moves, thus providing a positive righting moment. If this occurs, the floating object is said to have a positive [[metacentric height]]. This situation is typically valid for a range of heel angles, beyond which the centre of buoyancy does not move enough to provide a positive righting moment, and the object becomes unstable. It is possible to shift from positive to negative or vice versa more than once during a heeling disturbance, and many shapes are stable in more than one position.

==Compressible fluids and objects==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
The [[air density|atmosphere's density]] depends upon altitude. As an [[airship]] rises in the atmosphere, its buoyancy decreases as the density of the surrounding air decreases. In contrast, as a [[submarine]] expels water from its buoyancy tanks, it rises because its volume is constant (the volume of water it displaces if it is fully submerged) while its mass is decreased.

===Compressible objects===
As a floating object rises or falls, the forces external to it change and, as all objects are compressible to some extent or another, so does the object's volume. Buoyancy depends on volume and so an object's buoyancy reduces if it is compressed and increases if it expands.

If an object at equilibrium has a [[compressibility]] less than that of the surrounding fluid, the object's equilibrium is stable and it remains at rest. If, however, its compressibility is greater, its equilibrium is then [[unstable]], and it rises and expands on the slightest upward perturbation, or falls and compresses on the slightest downward perturbation.

====Submarines====
{{see also|Submarine#Submersion and trimming}}
Submarines rise and dive by filling large [[ballast]] tanks with seawater. To dive, the tanks are opened to allow air to exhaust out the top of the tanks, while the water flows in from the bottom. Once the weight has been balanced so the overall density of the submarine is equal to the water around it, it has neutral buoyancy and will remain at that depth. Most military submarines operate with a slightly negative buoyancy and maintain depth by using the "lift" of the stabilizers with forward motion.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

====Balloons====
The height to which a balloon rises tends to be stable. As a balloon rises it tends to increase in volume with reducing atmospheric pressure, but the balloon itself does not expand as much as the air on which it rides. The average density of the balloon decreases less than that of the surrounding air. The weight of the displaced air is reduced. A rising balloon stops rising when it and the displaced air are equal in weight. Similarly, a sinking balloon tends to stop sinking.

====Divers====
Underwater divers are a common example of the problem of unstable buoyancy due to compressibility. The diver typically wears an exposure suit which relies on gas-filled spaces for insulation, and may also wear a [[Buoyancy compensator (diving)|buoyancy compensator]], which is a variable volume buoyancy bag which is inflated to increase buoyancy and deflated to decrease buoyancy. The desired condition is usually neutral buoyancy when the diver is swimming in mid-water, and this condition is unstable, so the diver is constantly making fine adjustments by control of lung volume, and has to adjust the contents of the buoyancy compensator if the depth varies.

==Density==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
[[Image:Density column.JPG|thumb|right|250x250px|Density column of liquids &amp; solids: [[Baby Oil|baby oil]], [[rubbing alcohol|alcohol]] (with red [[food coloring]]), vegetable oil, wax, water (with blue food coloring), &amp; aluminum.]]
If the weight of an object is less than the weight of the displaced fluid when fully submerged, then the object has an average density that is less than the fluid and when fully submerged will experience a buoyancy force greater than its own weight. If the fluid has a surface, such as water in a lake or the sea, the object will float and settle at a level where it displaces the same weight of fluid as the weight of the object. If the object is immersed in the fluid, such as a submerged submarine or air in a balloon, it will tend to rise.
If the object has exactly the same density as the fluid, then its buoyancy equals its weight. It will remain submerged in the fluid, but it will neither sink nor float, although a disturbance in either direction will cause it to drift away from its position.
An object with a higher average density than the fluid will never experience more buoyancy than weight and it will sink.
A ship will float even though it may be made of steel (which is much denser than water), because it encloses a volume of air (which is much less dense than water), and the resulting shape has an average density less than that of the water.

'''Cota''' is a [[wireless power]] technology built on the same principles and frequencies as [[Wi-Fi]]. Cota was announced on September 9, 2013 at [[TechCrunch Disrupt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/09/cota-by-ossia-wireless-power/?icid=maing-grid7%7Cmain5%7Cdl24%7Csec1_lnk2%26pLid%3D374680 |title=Cota By Ossia Aims To Drive A Wireless Power Revolution And Change How We Think About Charging |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2013-09-09 |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Cota can detect the position of a power receiver within its network and focus a signal to only that position, enabling up to 1 watt of power to be transmitted wirelessly. Since the charge hub can detect, focus, and send the signal to a specific point in 3D space, there is no risk of injury compared to other means of wireless power such as [[microwave power transmission]]. Additionally, since Cota uses the same frequency range as Wi-Fi, its range is about 30 feet, an improvement over inductive wireless standards such as [[Qi (inductive power standard)|Qi]] which typically have a range of only a few centimeters.

In the [[renormalization group]] analysis of [[phase transition]]s in [[physics]], a '''critical dimension''' is the [[dimensionality]] of space at which the character of the phase transition changes. Below the '''lower critical dimension''' there is no phase transition. Above the '''upper critical dimension''' the [[critical exponents]] of the theory become the same as that in [[mean field theory]]. An elegant criterion to obtain the critical dimension within mean field theory is due to [[Vitaly Ginzburg|V. Ginzburg]].

Since the [[renormalization group]] sets up a relation between a phase transition and a [[quantum field theory]], this has implications for the latter and for our larger understanding of renormalization in general. Above the upper critical dimension, the quantum field theory which belongs to the model of the phase transition is a [[free field theory]]. Below the lower critical dimension, there is no field theory corresponding to the model.

In the context of [[string theory]] the meaning is more restricted: the ''critical dimension'' is the dimension at which [[string theory]] is consistent assuming a constant [[dilaton]] background without additional confounding permutations from background radiation effects. The precise number may be determined by the required cancellation of [[conformal anomaly]] on the [[worldsheet]]; it is 26 for the [[bosonic string theory]] and 10 for [[superstring theory]].

==Upper critical dimension in field theory==
Determining the upper critical dimension of a field theory is a matter of [[linear algebra]]. It nevertheless is worthwhile to formalize the procedure because it yields the lowest-order approximation for scaling and essential input for the [[renormalization group]]. It also reveals conditions to have a critical model in the first place.

[[Image:CriticalHyperplane.png|thumb|400px|right|The exponents of the monomials of a critical Lagrangian define a hyperplane in an exponent space. The upper critical dimension may be read off at the &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt;-axis..]]

A [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] may be written as a sum of terms, each consisting of an integral over a [[monomial]] of coordinates &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and fields &lt;math&gt;\phi_i&lt;/math&gt;. Examples are the standard &lt;math&gt;\phi^4&lt;/math&gt;-model and the isotropic [[Multicritical point|Lifshitz tricritical point]] with Lagrangians

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S =\int d^{d}x\left\{ \frac{1}{2}\left( \nabla \phi \right) ^{2}+u\phi^{4}\right\},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S_{L.T.P} =\int d^{d}x\left\{ \frac{1}{2}\left( \nabla ^{2}\phi \right) ^{2}+u\phi ^{3}\nabla ^{2}\phi +w\phi ^{6}\right\} ,&lt;/math&gt;
see also the figure on the right.
This simple structure may be compatible with a [[scale invariance]] under a rescaling of the
coordinates and fields with a factor &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; according to
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x_{i}\rightarrow x_{i}b^{\left[ x_{i}\right]}, \phi _{i}\rightarrow
\phi _{i}b^{\left[ \phi _{i}\right] }.&lt;/math&gt;
Time isn't singled out here&amp;nbsp;— it is just another coordinate: if the Lagrangian contains a time variable then this variable is to be rescaled as &lt;math&gt;t\rarr tb^{-z}&lt;/math&gt; with some constant exponent &lt;math&gt;z=-[t]&lt;/math&gt;. The goal is to determine the exponent set &lt;math&gt;N=\{[x_i], [\phi_i]\}&lt;/math&gt;.

One exponent, say &lt;math&gt;[x_1]&lt;/math&gt;, may be chosen arbitrarily, for example &lt;math&gt;[x_1]=-1&lt;/math&gt;. In the language of dimensional analysis this means that the exponents &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; count wave vector factors (a [[reciprocal length]] &lt;math&gt;k=1/L_1&lt;/math&gt;). Each monomial of the Lagrangian thus leads to a homogeneous linear equation &lt;math&gt;\sum E_{i,j}N_j=0&lt;/math&gt; for the exponents &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. If there are &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (inequivalent) coordinates and fields in the Lagrangian, then &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; such equations constitute a square matrix. If this matrix were invertible then there only would be the trivial solution &lt;math&gt;N=0&lt;/math&gt;.

The condition &lt;math&gt;\det(E_{i,j})=0&lt;/math&gt; for a nontrivial solution gives an equation between the space dimensions, and this determines the upper critical dimension &lt;math&gt;d_u&lt;/math&gt; (provided there is only one variable dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; in the Lagrangian). A redefinition of the coordinates and fields now shows that determining the scaling exponents &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to a dimensional analysis with respect to the wavevector &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, with all coupling constants occurring in the Lagrangian rendered dimensionless. Dimensionless coupling constants are the technical hallmark for the upper critical dimension.

Naive scaling at the level of the Lagrangian doesn't directly correspond to physical scaling because a [[cutoff (physics)|cutoff]] is required to give a meaning to the [[Quantum field theory|field theory]] and the [[path integral formulation|path integral]]. Changing the length scale also changes the number of degrees of freedom.
This complication is taken into account by the [[renormalization group]]. The main result at the upper critical dimension is that scale invariance remains valid for large factors &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, but with additional &lt;math&gt;ln(b)&lt;/math&gt; factors in the scaling of the coordinates and fields.

What happens below or above &lt;math&gt;d_u&lt;/math&gt; depends on whether one is interested in long distances ([[statistical field theory]]) or short distances ([[quantum field theory]]). Quantum field theories are trivial (convergent) below &lt;math&gt;d_u&lt;/math&gt; and not renormalizable above &lt;math&gt;d_u&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zinn-Justin, Jean |title=Quantum field theory and critical phenomena |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |location=Oxford |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=0-19-851882-X |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical field theories are trivial (convergent) above &lt;math&gt;d_u&lt;/math&gt; and renormalizable below &lt;math&gt;d_u&lt;/math&gt;. In the latter case there arise "anomalous" contributions to the naive scaling exponents &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. These anomalous contributions to the effective [[critical exponent]]s vanish at the upper critical dimension.

It is instructive to see how the scale invariance at the upper critical dimension becomes a scale invariance below this dimension. For small external wave vectors the [[vertex function]]s &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; acquire additional exponents, for example &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_2(k)\thicksim k^{2-\eta(d)}&lt;/math&gt;. If these exponents are inserted into a matrix &lt;math&gt;A(d)&lt;/math&gt; (which only has values in the first column) the condition for scale invariance becomes &lt;math&gt;\det(E+A(d))=0&lt;/math&gt;. This equation only can be satisfied if the anomalous exponents of the vertex functions cooperate in some way. In fact, the vertex functions depend on each other hierarchically. One way to express this interdependence are the [[Dyson-Schwinger equation]]s.

Naive scaling at &lt;math&gt;d_u&lt;/math&gt; thus is important as zeroth order approximation. Naive scaling at the upper critical dimension also classifies terms of the Lagrangian as relevant, irrelevant or marginal. A Lagrangian is compatible with scaling if the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;- and &lt;math&gt;\phi_i&lt;/math&gt; -exponents &lt;math&gt;E_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; lie on a hyperplane, for examples see the figure above. &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a normal vector of this hyperplane.

==Lower critical dimension==
The lower critical dimension &lt;math&gt;d_L&lt;/math&gt; of a phase transition of a given [[universality class]] is the last dimension for which this phase transition doesn't occur if the dimension is increased starting with &lt;math&gt;d=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Thermodynamic stability of an ordered phase depends on [[entropy]] and energy. Quantitatively this depends on the type of [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain wall]]s and their fluctuation modes. There appears to be no generic formal way for deriving the lower critical dimension of a field theory. Lower bounds may be derived with [[statistical mechanics]] arguments.

Consider first a one-dimensional system with short range interactions. Creating a domain wall requires a fixed energy amount &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Extracting this energy from other degrees of freedom decreases entropy by &lt;math&gt;\Delta S=-\epsilon/T&lt;/math&gt;. This entropy change must be compared with the entropy of the domain wall itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pitaevskii, L. P. |author2=Landau, L. D. |author3=Lifshitz, E. M. |author4=Sykes, J. B. |author5=Kearsley, M. W. |author6=Lifshitz, E. M. |title=Statistical physics |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]] |location=Oxford |year=1991 |pages= |isbn=0-7506-3372-7 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a system of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; there are &lt;math&gt;L/a&lt;/math&gt; positions for the domain wall, leading (according to [[boltzmann principle|Boltzmann's principle]]) to an entropy gain &lt;math&gt;\Delta S=k_B \log(L/a)&lt;/math&gt;. For nonzero temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; large enough the entropy gain always dominates, and thus there is no phase transition in one-dimensional systems with short-range interactions at &lt;math&gt;T &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Space dimension &lt;math&gt;d_1=1&lt;/math&gt; thus is a lower bound for the lower critical dimension of such systems.

A stronger lower bound &lt;math&gt;d_L=2&lt;/math&gt; can be derived with the help of similar arguments for systems with short range interactions and an [[order parameter]] with a continuous symmetry. In this case the [[Mermin–Wagner theorem|Mermin-Wagner-Theorem]] states that the order parameter expectation value vanishes in &lt;math&gt;d=2&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;T &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, and there thus is no phase transition of the usual type at &lt;math&gt;d_L=2&lt;/math&gt; and below.

For systems with [[quenched disorder]] a criterion given by Imry and Ma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Random-Field Instability of the Ordered State of Continuous Symmetry | journal = Phys. Rev. Lett. | year = 1975 | first = Y. | last = Imry |author2=S. K. Ma | volume = 35 | pages = 1399 |bibcode = 1975PhRvL..35.1399I |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.35.1399 }}&lt;/ref&gt; might be relevant. These authors used the criterion to determine the lower critical dimension of random field magnets.

'''Flow Energy''' is an [[Energy industry|energy company]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/energy_firm_set_to_create_700_new_jobs_in_ipswich_through_launch_of_game_changing_gas_boiler_1_3827399|title=Energy firm set to create 700 new jobs in Ipswich through launch of ‘game-changing’ gas boiler|work=Ipswich Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flow Energy launched its domestic energy supply service in April 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energylinx.co.uk/news/2013/04/flow-energy-launches-its-first-ever-tari.html|title=Flow Energy launches its first ever tariff|work=Energy Linx}}&lt;/ref&gt; supplying gas and electricity to homes throughout the UK.

The company has also developed a household electricity-generating [[boiler]]. The Flow boiler provides heating and hot water and also generates electricity, using patented technology, to be used in the household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-2803561/Flow-Energy-set-launch-boiler-generates-electricity.html|title=Could a boiler that generates electricity be the answer to cutting energy bills?|work=This is Money}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to changes in subsidy support in the UK, efforts for commercialisation of the Flow boiler are now focused on the European market.

==Overview==
Flow Energy is part of Flowgroup plc, an energy innovation and services company listed on the AIM exchange on the London Stock Market and founded in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flowenergy.uk.com/who-we-are/|title=Who are we - Flow Energy|work=Flow Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters is in Ipswich, Suffolk.

In April 2014 Flow Energy launched its domestic energy supply service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energylinx.co.uk/news/2013/04/flow-energy-launches-its-first-ever-tari.html|title=Flow Energy launches its first ever tariff|work=Energy Linx}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2015 Flow Energy exceeded 100,000 home energy customer accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.which.co.uk/energy/saving-money/guides/small-energy-companies/flow-energy/|title=Energy companies reviewed: Small energy companies|work=Which?}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sector of the UK economy is dominated by a number of larger companies such as the [[Big Six Energy Suppliers (UK)]].  Flow is considered as one of the emerging set of smaller suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/money/6654666/Big-Six-energy-suppliers-facing-stiff-competition.html|title=Energy minnows’ market share up 50 per cent|work=The Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015 the company announced a deal with Shell Energy Europe to provide access to wholesale energy - gas and electricity – without the need for significant levels of collateral to be deposited. The deal was designed to enable growth in the company’s energy supply business and increase the customer base for its product and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/flowgroups-subsidiary-signs-shell-deal-094700557.html|title=Flowgroup's subsidiary signs Shell deal|work=Yahoo! Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018 Flowgroup plc announced its intention to sell Flow Energy to [[Co-op Energy]] for £9.25 million. Flowgroup had previously sold its boiler technology business to focus on energy supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Cash-strapped Flow Energy sells out to Co-op|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/04/10/cash-strapped-flow-energy-sells-co-op/|newspaper=The Telegraph|author=Jillian Ambrose|date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boiler==
The company has developed a household [[boiler]] that feeds back [[electricity]] to the local [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]]. The Flow boiler provides heating and hot water whilst also generating low carbon electricity for the household using its patented MicroCHP (Combined Heat and Power) technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2810404/Boiler-generates-electricity-cut-power-bills-500-Mini-power-station-provide-heating-hot-water-fuelling-generator-appliances.html|title=Boiler that generates electricity 'could cut power bills by £500|work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/energy-bills/11253072/Hi-tech-boiler-generates-500-free-electricity-would-it-work-for-you.html|title=Hi-tech boiler generates £500 'free' electricity - would it work for you?|work=Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/17/new-boiler-generates-electricity|title=The new boiler that generates electricity for the National Grid|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/flow-energy-launches-boiler-that-produces-electric-power-2015-1|title=A British company has invented a boiler that generates electricity as well as heat|work=Business Insider UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/business/flow-boiler-can-cut-energy-8082610|title=Flow boiler can cut energy bills and generate power|work=Liverpool Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connectingindustry.com/energymanagement/-flow-taking-orders-for-its-revolutionary-electricity-generating-boiler-.aspx|title=Flow taking orders for its revolutionary electricity-generating boiler|work=Connecting Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flow’s boiler was originally manufactured by [[Jabil Circuit|Jabil Circuit Inc]] (“Jabil”), one of the world’s leading OEM manufacturing partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telegraphinvestor.moneyam.com/news/article/4925263/Flowgroup-starts-volume-production.html|title=Flowgroup starts volume production|work=Telegraph Investor}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Flow’s relationship with Jabil has now ended as the Flow boiler is no longer available in the UK. Jabil has been paid £4m to allow Flowgroup to exit the contract.

The boiler was designed in Capenhurst near Chester and manufactured in Livingston, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.247homerescue.co.uk/flow-energys-money-saving-electricity-generating-gas-boiler-to-become-available-in-january/|title=low Energy’s money-saving electricity-generating gas boiler to become available in January|work=247 Home Rescue}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014 the company opened its research, training and development facility in Runcorn, Cheshire, where Gas Safe registered engineers undertake surveying, installation and aftercare training programmes to become accredited installers of the Flow boiler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iii.co.uk/research/LSE:FLOW/news/item/1500590/final-results|title=Flowgroup plc (LSE:FLOW) Share Price|work=Interactive Investor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, with the change in focus for the Flow boiler to the European market, this centre has now closed and Manufacturing has now stopped, Jabil has been paid £7m to allow flowgroup to exit the contract.

==Smart Products==
In March 2016 the company launched a range of [[Internet of Things|connected home devices]] including a smart thermostat, smart plugs and an energy consumption monitor. The devices are controlled and monitored through a smart phone app or an online panel and offer customers extra control over appliances and energy usage, as well as savings on energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stockmarketwire.com/article/5223438/Flowgroup-launches-connected-home-product-range.html|title=Flowgroup launches connected home product range|work=Stock Marketwire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In March 2015 Flow Energy was awarded a Real Business Everline Future 50 award, in the Environment and Sustainability category, for being one of the most disruptive British businesses of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realbusiness.co.uk/article/29499-50-of-the-most-disruptive-british-businesses-in-2015_29499|title=50 of the most disruptive British businesses in 2015|work=Real Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Flow Energy was one of only two energy suppliers to be awarded [[Which?]] Provider of the year 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.which.co.uk/energy/saving-money/guides/small-energy-companies/flow-energy/|title=Energy companies reviewed: Small energy companies|work=Which?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flow Energy was awarded Which? Recommended Provider status following comprehensive analysis of Flow Energy's policies, pricing, communications, customer service and complaint handling. The assessment process also included a survey of Flow Energy's customers which generated a Which? customer score of 73%, the overall industry average is 53%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/FLOW/12662127.html|title=Flow Energy awarded Which?

In automobile and aircraft engineering a  '''fuel gauge''' or '''gas gauge''' is an [[Measuring instrument|instrument]] used to indicate the amount of [[fuel]] in a [[fuel tank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erjavec|first=Jack|title=Automotive Technology|year=2005|isbn=1-4018-4831-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motor vehicles==
[[Image:Fuel_gauge_(Toyota_Corolla).jpg|thumb|An analog fuel gauge in a 2016 [[Toyota Corolla]]]]
As used in vehicles, the gauge consists of two parts:

* The sending unit - in the tank
* The indicator - on the dashboard

The sending unit usually uses a float connected to a [[potentiometer]], typically printed ink design in a modern automobile. As the tank empties, the float drops and slides a moving contact along the resistor, increasing its resistance.&lt;ref&gt;http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-gauge2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, when the resistance is at a certain point, it will also turn on a "low fuel" light on some vehicles.

Meanwhile, the indicator unit (usually mounted on the [[dashboard]]) is measuring and displaying the amount of electric current flowing through the sending unit. When the tank level is high and maximum current is flowing, the needle points to "F" indicating a full tank. When the tank is empty and the least current is flowing, the needle points to "E" indicating an empty tank.
[[File:Mazda 3 Fuel Gauge Showing Empty.jpg|alt=|thumb|The digital fuel gauge in a 2018 Mazda 3 showing a nearly-empty tank along with a distance to empty display.]]
The system can be [[fail-safe]]. If an electrical fault opens, the electrical circuit causes the indicator to show the tank as being empty (theoretically provoking the driver to refill the tank) rather than full (which would allow the driver to run out of fuel with no prior notification). Corrosion or wear of the potentiometer will provide erroneous readings of fuel level. However, this system has a potential risk associated with it. An [[electric current]] is sent through the variable resistor to which a float is connected, so that the value of resistance depends on the fuel level. In most automotive fuel gauges such resistors are on the inward side of the gauge, i.e., inside the fuel tank. Sending current through such a resistor has a fire hazard and an explosion risk associated with it. These resistance sensors are also showing an increased failure rate with the incremental additions of [[alcohol]] in automotive gasoline fuel. Alcohol increases the corrosion rate at the potentiometer, as it is capable of carrying current like water. Potentiometer applications for alcohol fuel use a pulse-and-hold methodology, with a periodic signal being sent to determine fuel level decreasing the corrosion potential. Therefore, demand for another safer, non-contact method for fuel level is desired.

==Aircraft==
[[Magnetoresistance]] type fuel level sensors, now becoming common in small aircraft applications, offer a potential alternative for automotive use. These fuel level sensors work similar to the potentiometer example, however a sealed detector at the float pivot determines the angular position of a magnet pair at the pivot end of the float arm. These are highly accurate, and the electronics are completely outside the fuel. The non-contact nature of these sensors address the fire and explosion hazard, and also the issues related to any fuel combinations or additives to gasoline or to any alcohol fuel mixtures. Magneto resistive sensors are suitable for all fuel or fluid combinations, including LPG and LNG. The fuel level output for these senders can be ratiometric voltage or preferable [[CAN bus]] digital. These sensors also [[fail-safe]] in that they either provide a level output or nothing.

Systems that measure large fuel tanks (including underground storage tanks) may use the same electro-mechanical principle or may make use of a pressure sensor, sometimes connected to a [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] [[Pressure measurement|manometer]].

Many large transport [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] use a different fuel gauge design principle. An aircraft may use a number (around 30 on an A320) of low voltage tubular capacitor probes where the fuel becomes the [[dielectric]]. At different fuel levels, different values of capacitance are measured and therefore the level of fuel can be determined. In early designs, the profiles and values of individual probes were chosen to compensate for fuel tank shape and aircraft pitch and roll attitudes. In more modern aircraft, the probes tend to be linear (capacitance proportional to fuel height) and the fuel computer works out how much fuel there is (slightly different on different manufacturers). This has the advantage that a faulty probe may be identified and eliminated from the fuel calculations. In total this system can be more than 99% accurate. Since most commercial aircraft only take on board fuel necessary for the intended flight (with appropriate safety margins), the system allows the fuel load to be preselected, causing the fuel delivery to be shut off when the intended load has been taken on board.

{{nihongo|'''''Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still'''''|ジャイアント・ロボ - 地球が静止する日|Jaianto Robo - Chikyū ga seishi suru hi}} is a 1992 to 1998 [[original video animation]] series based on [[Mitsuteru Yokoyama]]'s [[manga]] series ''[[Giant Robo]]''. It was written and directed by [[Yasuhiro Imagawa]].

''Giant Robo'' is a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to Yokoyama's career. The series features characters and plotlines from the [[manga artist]]'s entire canon of work, effectively creating an all-new story. The events take place in the near future, ten years after the advent of the Shizuma Drive triggers the third energy revolution. The series follows the master of the titular Robo, Daisaku Kusama, and the Experts of Justice, an international police organization locked in battle with the BF Group, a secret society hell-bent on world domination.

The OVA is recognized for its "[[retro]]" style and [[opera]]tic score. The character designs emulate Yokoyama's drawing style and the action [[setpiece]]s are influenced by [[Hong Kong action cinema]].

The first installment of the series, "The Black Attaché Case," was released July 22, 1992. Originally intended to finish within 36 months, the seven-volume series was ultimately released over the span of six years. "The Grand Finale" was released January 25, 1998. The OVA has since been translated into English, [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], French, Italian and [[Korean language|Korean]].

== Plot ==
The series takes place in a [[retro-futuristic]] setting, where the Shizuma Drive ends the [[Oil depletion|depletion of petroleum]] resources and the need for [[nuclear power]]. The system is a non-polluting recyclable energy source that powers everything on land, sea and air. Ten years prior to the events of the series a team of scientists, led by Professor Shizuma, created the revolutionary system. In the process they nearly destroyed the world and one of their own, Franken von Vogler, was lost in the event that went down in history as the "Tragedy of Bashtarle." At the start of ''Giant Robo'', the BF Group is in the middle of recreating the event with aid from the resurfaced von Vogler.

The story explores a society completely brought down, within the span of one week, because of dependency on a single energy source and a state of prosperity tainted by compromise and deceit.&lt;ref name="theEX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ex.org/3.2/04-feature_gr1.html |title=''Giant Robo'' Feature |accessdate=2007-01-01 |last=Luce |first=Eric |publisher=EX: The Online World of Anime &amp; Manga |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207111221/http://www.ex.org/3.2/04-feature_gr1.html |archivedate=2006-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''BF Group'''|BF団|Bīefu dan}} is the main [[antagonist]] of the series. Their origin is unknown, but not so their reason to be:&lt;ref name = "liner3feature"/&gt; to lead mankind down a road of ruin. The Group's forces consist of mechanical monsters, foot soldiers and {{nihongo|''Experts''|エキスパート|Ekisupāto}}, individuals with [[superhuman]] powers.

The most powerful Experts form the ruling cadre of the organization, the cabal of the {{nihongo|'''Magnificent Ten'''|十傑集|Jūkesshū}}. Its members swear allegiance to {{nihongo|'''Big Fire'''|ビッグ・ファイア|Biggu Faia}}, the Group's founder and leader, with faltering loyalty punishable by death. At the time of ''The Day the Earth Stood Still'', the Ten are gearing up for the final showdown with the IPO.

The {{nihongo|'''International Police Organization'''|国際警察機構|Kokusai Keisatsu Kikō}} is the BF Group's counterpart in the ''Giant Robo'' [[fictional universe|universe]].&lt;ref name = "liner3feature"&gt;"The world of ''Giant Robo'': The BF Group vs. the IPO". [[Liner Notes]]. (1993). ''Giant Robo Volume 3''. [[Bandai Visual]].&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the world acknowledged Big Fire as a threat to world security and signed the [[charter]] creating the IPO. The IPO's methods are [[research|information]] and [[espionage]], looking to bring down the BF Group rather than defeating them in an all-out war.

However, to counter Big Fire's superhuman elements, "Experts" are recruited and granted special international jurisdiction. The agents assembled are known as the {{nihongo|'''Experts of Justice'''|正義のエキスパート|Seigi no Ekisupāto}}. Working with the Experts from the [[Peking]] Branch is Daisaku Kusama. While he does not possess any special powers, Daisaku is the one and only master of Giant Robo. Constructed by Daisaku's father,&lt;ref name = "liner1bio"&gt;"Character biographies". [[Liner Notes]]. (1992). ''Giant Robo Volume 1''. [[Bandai Visual]].&lt;/ref&gt; Giant Robo is the IPO's trump card against Big Fire.

== Production ==
In 1990, producer Yasuhito Yamaki approached Yasuhiro Imagawa about working on an animated version of the ''Giant Robo'' manga.&lt;ref name = "liner1feature"&gt;"The Steel God cometh!". [[Liner Notes]]. (1992). ''Giant Robo Volume 1''. [[Bandai Visual]].&lt;/ref&gt; Imagawa, a self-proclaimed fan of Yokoyama's work, jumped at the chance of working on the project.&lt;ref name = "liner2feature"&gt;"Vibrant Designs". [[Liner Notes]]. (1993). ''Giant Robo Volume 2''. [[Bandai Visual]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Giant Robo manga had started in 1967 and had never been adapted into animation before. It had a live action [[Giant Robo (tokusatsu)|live-action adaptation]] that premiered on [[TV Asahi]] in 1967.

In pre-production, Imagawa was informed he could not use any of the supporting characters from the manga or live-action versions.&lt;ref name="fringe"/&gt; Instead, with Yokoyama's permission, he populated the series with characters from the artist's entire canon of work including ''[[Akakage]]'', ''[[Babel II]]'' and ''[[Godmars]]''.&lt;ref name = "jump"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://animejump.com/giantrobo/index2.html  | title = Behind the Night's Illusions - the characters of Giant Robo: the Animation '''(Archive)''' | publisher = Anime Jump | year = 1999 | accessdate = 2007-01-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030713151326/http://animejump.com/giantrobo/index2.html |archivedate = 2003-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Giant Robo'' OVA still follows Daisaku and Robo, and the main antagonist is still called "Big Fire," but it features an all-new storyline with a completely different cast of characters.

The first episode was released July 22, 1992 with the following three installments staying close to the proposed schedule of six months between releases.&lt;ref name="theEX"/&gt; In the nine months between the releases of ''Volume''s ''4'' and ''5'', two [[OVA]]'s focusing on the character of GinRei were produced.&lt;ref name = "GinRei"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ouellette | first = Martin |date=September–October 1994 | title = Ginrei | journal = [[Protoculture Addicts]] | issue = 30 |pages = 14–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Nihongo|''Barefoot GinRei''|素足のGinRei|Suashi no GinRei}} is a humorous take on GinRei's job as a spy for the IPO. {{Nihongo|''Mighty GinRei''|鉄腕GinRei|Tetsuwan GinRei}}, a [[parody|send up]] of [[super robot]] series, features [[Ken Ishikawa (manga artist)|Ken Ishikawa]] as guest mech designer. A third OVA, {{Nihongo|''GinRei with Blue Eyes''|青い瞳の銀鈴|Aoi hitomi no Gin Rei}}, was released after ''Volume 5'' of ''Giant Robo''.

The final episode was released January 1998, almost three years after episode six. In between releases, members of the ''Giant Robo'' staff worked on other projects including ''[[The Big O]]'',&lt;ref name="ACen03"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fansview.com/2003/animecentral/051703c.htm |title=Anime Central 2003 Panel |accessdate=2007-01-01 |publisher=A Fan's View |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201253/http://www.fansview.com/2003/animecentral/051703c.htm |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Getter Robo Armageddon]]'',&lt;ref name="animaze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fansview.com/1999/032099a.htm |title=Animazement - Yasuhiro Imagawa |date=1999-03-20 |accessdate=2007-01-01 |publisher=A Fan's View |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013201/http://www.fansview.com/1999/032099a.htm |archivedate=2007-09-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Super Atragon'', a two-episode OVA of [[Shunro Oshikawa]]'s ''Kaitei Gunkan'' novel.

Imagawa intended ''The Day the Earth Stood Still'' to be the second to final chapter in the conflict between the Experts of Justice and Big Fire.&lt;ref name = "liner3QandA"&gt;"Imagawa Answers Your Questions!". [[Liner Notes]]. (1993). ''Giant Robo Volume 3''. [[Bandai Visual]].&lt;/ref&gt; The OVA would be preceded by ''The Birth of Zangetsu the Midday'',&lt;ref&gt;The 2007 {{Nihongo|''[[Tetsujin 28-go]]: Hakuchuu no Zangetsu''|鉄人28号 白昼の残月}} feature film, written and directed by Imagawa, shares its name with this story.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Plan to Assassinate Daisaku - the Canary Penitentiary'', ''The Boy of Three Days'', ''The Greatest Battle in History - General Kanshin vs. Shokatsu Koumei'' and ''The Boy Detective, Kindaichi Shōtarō, Appears!''&lt;ref&gt;The title is a reference to Shōtarō Kaneda, the boy detective of ''[[Tetsujin 28-go]]'', and [[Kosuke Kindaichi]], the fictional detective created by [[Seishi Yokomizo]].&lt;/ref&gt; The final chapter is titled ''The Siege of [[Tower of Babel|Babel]]''. No further stories have been animated.&lt;ref name="fringe"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/02.09/feature/9/index.php3 | title = The Yasuhiro Imagawa Lecture | accessdate = 2007-01-01 | last = Khan | first = Ridwan |date=September 2002 | publisher = Animefringe: Online Anime Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
[[File:Bashtarle (Giant Robo).jpg|thumb|[[Donizetti]]'s [[aria]] serves as theme to the events of "The Tragedy of Bashtarle", always seen in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] and shades of gray.]]
The score of ''Giant Robo'' was composed, arranged and conducted by [[Masamichi Amano]] and performed by the [[Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra]] and Choir. The music ranges from grand pieces like "Charge! His Name is Giant Robo" to more light-hearted tracks like "Tetsugyu in Love."&lt;ref name="theEX"/&gt; Amano makes use of [[leitmotif]]s, recurring musical themes associated with different characters, places or events.

{{audio|Dies Irae (Giant Robo).ogg|Tragedy Occurs Again…}} is ''Giant Robo's [[Dies Irae]]'', first heard during the destruction of the ''[[Champs-Élysées]]'' in episode one. The [[hymn]], written in [[Medieval Latin]], describes what is known in [[Christian eschatology]] as [[Judgment Day]]. Along with Amano's original compositions, the soundtrack features "[[Una furtiva lagrima]]" from the 1832 opera ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]''.&lt;ref name = "encyclopedia"&gt;Clements, J. &amp; McCarthy, H. (2001). ''The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917''. Berkeley, CA: Stone Bridge Press. {{ISBN|1-880656-64-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For Imagawa, the aria embodies one of the themes of ''Giant Robo'': "the sorrow of others not understanding your true feelings".&lt;ref name = "animerica"/&gt;

The music of ''Giant Robo'' has been called one of the OVA's best accomplishments.&lt;ref name="oldschool"/&gt;  The complete score was released in seven soundtracks by [[Nippon Columbia]]. The first two soundtracks were released in North America by [[AnimeTrax]].

== Design ==
For series director Yasuhiro Imagawa, the [[fictional universe|world]] where the story unfolds must be convincing, for it is the setting and themes what determine the character and mecha designs.&lt;ref name="amigos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ex.org/2.5/06-feature_3amigos.html |title=Interview with "the three amigos" |last=Cahill |first=Peter |accessdate=2007-01-01 |publisher=EX: The Online World of Anime &amp; Manga |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509135828/http://www.ex.org/2.5/06-feature_3amigos.html |archivedate=2008-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the world of ''Giant Robo'', "anything goes".&lt;ref name = "liner2feature"/&gt; The technology is futuristic and the morals are modern. The world's outlook is bright, but there is an underlying sense of some sinister motive beneath it.&lt;ref name = "liner1feature"/&gt; ''Wuxia'' heroes coexist with modern-day [[esper (mythology)|esper]]s and giant robots as soldiers in a struggle between good and evil.

=== Art style ===
The ''Giant Robo'' OVA is one of many anime titles based on old properties produced in Japan during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Duffield | first = Patricia |date=April 2000 | title = Remakes of the '90s | journal = [[Animerica Extra]] | volume = 3 |issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While titles like ''[[Bubblegum Crisis 2040]]'', ''[[Dirty Pair Flash]]'' and ''[[Tekkaman Blade]]'' gave modern spins to old classics, the creators of ''Giant Robo'' decided to go with a "[[retro]]" look.

The characters were designed by [[Toshiyuki Kubooka]] (''[[Lunar series|Lunar]]'' series, ''[[The Idolmaster]]'') and [[Akihiko Yamashita]]. (''[[Princess Nine]]'', ''[[Tide-Line Blue]]'') The designers were asked to emulate Yokoyama's characters rather than create new ones. Admittedly "it took some time to catch on to Director Imagawa's intentions",&lt;ref name = "liner2feature"/&gt; but with repetition the staff was able to achieve Imagawa's vision of characters that look like they stepped out of anime from the 1960s.&lt;ref name= "boredom"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animeboredom.co.uk/anime-reviews/giant-robo/957/ |title = ''Giant Robo'' review | accessdate= 2007-06-01 | date = 2007-01-21 | last = Huxley | first = John | publisher = Anime Boredom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanical design is a case of high technology meets old school engineering.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insider.ign.com/videos/articles/378/378759p1.html |title=Anime Video Archives: Giant Robo |date=2002-11-26 |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author=IGN Staff |publisher=IGN Insider |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212225226/http://insider.ign.com/videos/articles/378/378759p1.html |archivedate=2004-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The titular mecha is an advanced piece of machinery,&lt;ref name= "animaze"/&gt; equipped with booster rockets and hidden weapons throughout. Sporting big stovepipe arms and exposed rivets,&lt;ref name= "amigos"/&gt;  the hulking giant is more like a [[weapon of mass destruction]] than a "robot superhero".&lt;ref name = "fringe"/&gt; Vehicles like the Shizuma-powered [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]] or the Experts' airship fortress in the design of a [[zeppelin]] appear as if they had been conceived at the [[Steampunk#Influences|turn of the 20th century]],&lt;ref name="BlackonDVD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/1226.php |title=Giant Robo Giga Premium Collection (3) |accessdate=2007-01-01 |last=Black |first=David |publisher=Anime on DVD |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180751/http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/1226.php |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving the world of ''Giant Robo'' a timeless feel.&lt;ref name = "liner3feature"/&gt;

''Giant Robo'' is credited with generating interest in re-imagining other artists' works,&lt;ref name = "encyclopedia"/&gt; including [[Osamu Tezuka]] and [[Go Nagai]], and creating a "retro" style that has been used in productions like ''[[Sakura Wars]]''.

=== Influences ===
The modern notion of the [[mecha anime|giant robot]] genre can be traced back to the 1970s.&lt;ref name="askjohn54"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2000/02/25/ask-john-how-did-anime-start/ |title=Ask John: How Did Anime Start? |date=2000-02-25 |accessdate=2007-01-01 |publisher=Anime Nation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009165715/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2000/02/25/ask-john-how-did-anime-start/ |archivedate=2008-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The works of [[Go Nagai]] (''[[Mazinger]]'', ''[[Getter Robo]]'') created the genre and the debut of [[Yoshiyuki Tomino]]'s ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' in 1979 solidified it. In this genre, the mecha is the focal point of the action. But for a genre anime, ''Giant Robo'' does not feature many giant robot battles;&lt;ref name="mahq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahq.net/rants/cons/imagawa/imagawa.htm |title=Yasuhiro Imagawa, Director of Mobile Fighter G Gundam |date=2002-08-15 |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author=MAHQ Staff |publisher=Mecha Anime HQ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527224515/http://www.mahq.net/rants/cons/imagawa/imagawa.htm |archivedate=2007-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead, it is the human characters who do the fighting.

Most of the "Experts" featured in ''The Day the Earth Stood Still'' come from Yokoyama's manga adaptations of ''[[Outlaws of the Marsh]]'' and ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'',&lt;ref name="cjas1"&gt;Neidengard, M. (January 30, 1999). The World's Mightiest Robot. ''[[Cornell]] Japanese Animation Society Newsletter''.&lt;/ref&gt; both ''wuxia'' novels and half of the "[[Four Classics]]" of [[Chinese literature]]. ''Wuxia'' are martial arts adventures populated by skilled, honorable fighters.&lt;ref name = "HKMAC"&gt;[[David Bordwell|Bordwell, David]]. "Hong Kong Martial Arts Cinema." In ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: A Portrait of the Ang Lee Film''. New York: Newmarket Press, 2000, pp. 14–21. {{ISBN|1-55704-459-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hong Kong action cinema]], the genre is associated with swordplay epics sprinkled with mysticism.

Given their origin, the heroes and villains of ''Giant Robo'' are superhuman combatants who share many elements with the errant knights of ''[[wuxia]]'' like strength, magic powers and the ability to [[Qing Gong|fly]].&lt;ref name="oldschool"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/old-school/2003-02-09 | title = Old School: Giant Robo | date = 2003-02-09 | accessdate = 2007-01-01 | last = Crandol | first = Mike | publisher = [[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''wuxia'' adventures, the characters are given nicknames that allude to their mastery of weapons, their physical appearance or their demeanor (''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'').

In ''[[jiang hu]]'', [[secret societies]] plot against the ''[[status quo]]'' (''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'') and powerful clans do war with each other.&lt;ref name="wuxiapien"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kungfucinema.com/categories/wuxiapien.htm |title=Wuxia Pian - Introduction |date=2004-02-17 |accessdate=2007-01-01 |last=Pollard |first=Mark |publisher=Kung Fu Cinema: Screen fighting news &amp; review |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20061031120701/http://www.kungfucinema.com/categories/wuxiapien.htm |archivedate=2006-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Giant Robo'' features the ongoing conflict between the Experts of Justice and the BF Group.&lt;ref name = "liner3feature"/&gt; Woven into the story are values commonly associated with martial arts films like honor,&lt;ref name = "HKMAC"/&gt; loyalty and individual justice, best exemplified in the rivalry between Alberto and Taisō.&lt;ref name = "liner5bio"&gt;"Character biographies". [[Liner Notes]]. (1994). ''Giant Robo Volume 5''. [[Bandai Visual]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Themes ===
''Giant Robo'' is structured as a "[[character driven]] drama,"&lt;ref name = "liner1feature"/&gt; emphasizing the relationships and personal histories of the characters over a mystery surrounding the titular mecha or a philosophical [[wiktionary:diatribe|diatribe]]. At the time of the series,&lt;ref name = "liner1bio"/&gt; Daisaku is 12 years old and the only child in the Experts of Justice. ''Giant Robo'' is the story of how Daisaku grows up and works to respect his father's last will and testament of protecting the world from the BF Group.

The OVA is comparable to a ''[[bildungsroman]]'',&lt;ref name = "newsletter"&gt;Thacker, J. (September 14, 2002). Well, what would you prefer? Yellow spandex?. ''[[Cornell]] Japanese Animation Society Newsletter''.&lt;/ref&gt; where the story traces the main character's development from childhood to maturity. The two most important characters in the boy's [[coming of age]] are his fellow Experts Tetsugyu and Kenji Murasame.&lt;ref name = "liner5QA"&gt;"Imagawa Answers Your Questions! (Part 2)". [[Liner Notes]]. (1994). ''Giant Robo Volume 5''. [[Bandai Visual]].&lt;/ref&gt; Tetsugyu is a grown-up, but still a "child" at heart. In the course of the story he and Daisaku grow up and mature, creating a parallel between them. Kenji, on the other hand, is what Daisaku sees as an "adult." Willing to sacrifice others for the sake of happiness, Kenji contrasts Daisaku's idealism.&lt;ref name = "amigos"/&gt;

The story delves on the relationship between fathers and sons and the unbreakable bond that exists between them.&lt;ref name = "animerica"&gt;Oshiguchi, Takashi. "Yasuhiro Imagawa." In ''Anime Interviews: The First Five Years of Animerica, Anime &amp; Manga Monthly (1992-97)''. [[VIZ Media]] LLC, 1997, pp. 78–83. {{ISBN|1-56931-220-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The characters of Daisaku and Genya lost their fathers at a young age and have been entrusted with a legacy that turns them to adversaries during ''The Day the Earth Stood Still''. Mirror images of one another, the characters fight to fulfill their respective fathers' dying wish at the expense of the other's.&lt;ref name = "oldschool"/&gt;

Dr. Kusama's dying question to Daisaku ("Can happiness be obtained without sacrifice? Can a new era be achieved without tragedy?") is at the crux of the series.&lt;ref name = "liner6QA"/&gt; Shizuma and his colleagues gave the world a new era of prosperity at the expense of billions of lives. The BF Group is willing to cause great misfortune to make their ideal world a reality, while many sacrifice themselves to protect it. The ending is bittersweet, with both sides suffering losses. For Imagawa, this was the only way of getting his point across. The series ends with a dedication to all fathers and their children "giving a glimmer of hope in the midst of all the sorrow."

The series may also be seen as "sort of an [[analogy]] or an [[allegory]] about [[nuclear technology]]", especially in the context of Japan's complex relationship to both its destructive and constructive aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2011/mar/23/rants-and-raves-godzilla/ |title=Rants and Raves: Godzilla |author=Beth Accomando |date=23 March 2011 |website=[[KPBS-FM]] |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The series was originally released by [[Bandai Visual]] on VHS and [[LaserDisc]] from 1992 to 1998. On March 24, 2000, [[Toshiba]] Entertainment released the series on [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 2]] DVD. The ''Giant Robo Giga Premium Collection'' (ASBY-1600) features digitally remastered video and audio, interviews with the creators and a companion book.

The distribution of the English-language version has been handled by five different companies. A LaserDisc edition was released by L.A. Hero in 1994. After L.A. Hero's license expired, it was released on VHS by [[U.S. Renditions]] and [[Manga Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Renditions, a division of Books Nippan, was the original licensor. After Books Nippan went out of business, Manga Entertainment picked up all their licenses, including ''Giant Robo''.&lt;/ref&gt; After Manga Entertainment's license expired, [[Media Blasters]] released ''Giant Robo'' on DVD. Media Blasters' 2004 release includes the [[Japanese language]] track, the Manga Entertainment dub, an all-new dub by [[NYAV Post]] and subtitled Japanese commentary tracks on some of the episodes. After Media Blasters' license expired, [[Discotek Media]] announced at Otakon 2018 on August 12th that they have picked up the series for a Blu-ray release. Despite the included Gin-Rei OVA being in SD, it will include everything from Media Blasters' previous release. Discotek has also hoped to produce brand new extras for this release as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-08-12/discotek-licenses-giant-robo-kimagure-orange-road-galaxy-express-999-more/.135382|title=Discotek Licenses Giant Robo, Kimagure Orange Road, Galaxy Express 999, More|last=Mateo|first=Alex|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=August 12, 2018|accessdate=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=TheGreatSG|number=1028680511722541057|date=August 12, 2018|title=GIANT ROBO FINALLY!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Giant Robo'' was distributed in the Netherlands by Manga DVD and in Hong Kong by Asia Video. The French version, dubbed by ''Saint Maur'' Studios, was distributed by ''[[Pathé]]''. The series was released in Italy by Granata Press, with an upcoming release by Shin Vision.

Along with the animated version, Imagawa scripted a manga illustrated by Mari Mizuta. Serialized in [[Kadokawa Shoten]]'s ''Comics Genki'', it delves deeper into the machinations of the BF Group and introduces {{nihongo|[[Yellow Emperor]] Rai-se|黄帝・ライセ|Kitei Rai-se}} as Big Fire's counterpart in the IPO.&lt;ref name = "liner3feature"/&gt; The issues were later collected in two [[tankōbon|volumes]] published under the Newtype 100% Comics [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]].

The ''Giant Robo'' video game (SLPM-62526) was released for [[PlayStation 2]] on November 3, 2004 by [[D3 Publisher]]. Set in ''The Day the Earth Stood Still'' continuity, the player leads Daisaku Kusama and Giant Robo on a quest to defeat the BF Group. As Daisaku, the player can pick up items and power-ups on the battlefield; as Giant Robo, the player does battle with other mechas. A Versus Mode allows players to compete against each other using any of the robots featured on the series. The game is not available in Europe or North America.

''Mighty Ginrei: Final Fight'' (COCC-12444), an [[Drama CD|audio drama]] sequel to the ''Mighty GinRei'' OVA, was released on April 21, 1995 by [[Nippon Columbia]]. ''Love Fight'', a music collection [[tie-in]], was released the same day.

== Reception ==
The final installment of ''Giant Robo'' was released on January 25, 1998, eight years after production began and a full decade since its inception.&lt;ref name = "liner7feature"&gt;"The journey of ten years". [[Liner Notes]]. (1998). ''Giant Robo Volume 7''.

==Definition==
"Graphene" is a combination of "[[graphite]]" and the suffix [[-ene]], named by [[Hanns-Peter Boehm]] and colleagues,&lt;ref name="termorigin"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1351/pac199466091893 |first=H. P. |last=Boehm |first2=R. |last2=Setton |first3=E. |last3=Stumpp |title=Nomenclature and terminology of graphite intercalation compounds |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1994/pdf/6609x1893.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=66 |issue=9 |year=1994 |pages=1893–1901 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406105828/http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1994/pdf/6609x1893.pdf |archivedate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who produced and observed single-layer carbon foils in 1962.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Boehm et al. introduced the term ''graphene'' in 1986 to describe single sheets of graphite. Graphene can be considered an "infinite alternant" (only six-member [[carbon ring]]) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simpson |first=C. D. |last2=Brand |first2=J. Diedrich |last3=Berresheim |first3=Alexander J. |last4=Przybilla |first4=Laurence |last5=Räder |first5=Hans Joachim |last6=Müllen |first6=Klaus |title=Synthesis of a Giant 222 Carbon Graphite Sheet |doi=10.1002/1521-3765(20020315)8:6&lt;1424::AID-CHEM1424&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z |journal=Chemistry |volume=8 |pages=1424–1429 |year=2002 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) notes, "previously, descriptions such as graphite layers, carbon layers, or carbon sheets have been used for the term graphene...it is incorrect to use for a single layer a term which includes the term graphite, which would imply a three-dimensional structure.

==Structure==
[[File:Graphene SPM.jpg|thumb|[[Scanning probe microscopy]] image of graphene]]
Graphene is a [[crystal]]line [[allotrope]] of carbon with 2-dimensional properties. Its carbon atoms are packed densely in a regular [[chicken wire (chemistry)|atomic-scale chicken wire]] ([[Hexagonal tiling|hexagonal]]) pattern.&lt;ref name=erog11/&gt;

Each atom has four bonds: one [[σ bond]] with each of its three neighbors and one [[π-bond]] that is oriented out of plane. The atoms are about 1.42 [[angström|Å]] apart.&lt;ref name="erog11"/&gt;

Graphene's hexagonal lattice can be regarded as two interleaving triangular lattices. This perspective was successfully used to calculate the band structure for a single graphite layer using a tight-binding approximation.&lt;ref name="erog11"/&gt;

Graphene's stability is due to its tightly packed carbon atoms and a sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[orbital hybridization]] – a combination of orbitals s, p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; that constitute the σ-bond. The final p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; electron makes up the π-bond. The π-bonds hybridize together to form the π-band and π∗-bands. These bands are responsible for most of graphene's notable electronic properties, via the half-filled band that permits free-moving electrons.&lt;ref name="erog11"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Experimental Review of Graphene |first=Daniel R. |last=Cooper |first2=Benjamin |last2=D’Anjou |first3=Nageswara |last3=Ghattamaneni |first4=Benjamin |last4=Harack |first5=Michael |last5=Hilke |first6=Alexandre |last6=Horth |first7=Norberto |last7=Majlis |first8=Mathieu |last8=Massicotte |first9=Leron |last9=Vandsburger |first10=Eric |last10=Whiteway |first11=Victor |last11=Yu |journal=ISRN Condensed Matter Physics |doi=10.5402/2012/501686 |accessdate=30 August 2016 |publisher=International Scholarly Research Network |volume=2012 |pages=1–56 |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphene has a theoretical [[specific surface area]] (SSA) of {{val|2630 |ul=m2 |up=g}}. This is much larger than that reported to date for carbon black (typically smaller than {{val|900 |ul=m2 |up=g}}) or for carbon nanotubes (CNTs), from ≈100 to {{val|1000 |ul=m2 |up=g}} and is similar to [[activated carbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1246501 |title=Graphene, related two-dimensional crystals, and hybrid systems for energy conversion and storage |journal=Science |volume=347 |issue=6217 |page=1246501 |year=2015 |last1=Bonaccorso |first1=F. |last2=Colombo |first2=L. |last3=Yu |first3=G. |last4=Stoller |first4=M. |last5=Tozzini |first5=V. |last6=Ferrari |first6=A.

Graphene is a zero-gap [[semiconductor]], because its [[Conduction band|conduction]] and [[valence bands]] meet at the Dirac points, which are six locations in [[momentum space]], on the edge of the [[Brillouin zone]], divided into two non-equivalent sets of three points. The two sets are labeled K and K'. The sets give graphene a valley degeneracy of {{nowrap |1=''gv'' = 2}}. By contrast, for traditional semiconductors the primary point of interest is generally Γ, where momentum is zero.&lt;ref name="erog11"/&gt;  However, if the in-plane direction is confined, in which case it is referred to as a [[graphene nanoribbon|nanoribbon]], its electronic structure is different. If it is "zig-zag", the bandgap is zero. If it is "armchair", the bandgap is non-zero (see figure)...

Graphene's unique optical properties produce an unexpectedly high [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] for an atomic monolayer in vacuum, absorbing {{nowrap|''πα'' ≈ 2.3%}} of red [[light]], where ''α'' is the [[fine-structure constant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Universal infrared conductance of graphite |first=A.

[[Multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance]] was used to characterize both thickness and refractive index of chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD)-grown graphene films. The measured refractive index and extinction coefficient values at 670&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength are 3.135 and 0.897, respectively.

The method can be used for real-time label-free interactions of graphene with organic and inorganic substances. The existence of unidirectional surface plasmons in the nonreciprocal graphene-based gyrotropic interfaces has been demonstrated theoretically. By efficiently controlling the chemical potential of graphene, the unidirectional working frequency can be continuously tunable from THz to near-infrared and even visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=Xiao|last2=Xu|first2=Yang |last3=Zhang|first3=Baile|last4=Hao|first4=Ran|last5=Chen|first5=Hongsheng| last6=Li|first6=Erping|title=Unidirectional surface plasmons in nonreciprocal graphene|journal=New Journal of Physics|date=2013|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/15/11/113003|volume=15|issue=11|pages=113003|bibcode=2013NJPh...15k3003L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, the unidirectional frequency bandwidth can be 1–2 orders of magnitude larger than that in metal under the same magnetic field, which arises from the superiority of extremely small effective electron mass in graphene.

Graphene's [[band gap]] can be tuned from 0 to {{val|0.25 |u=eV}} (about 5 micrometre wavelength) by applying voltage to a dual-gate bilayer graphene [[field-effect transistor]] (FET) at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature08105 |journal=Nature |last=Zhang |first=Y. |last2=Tang |first2=Tsung-Ta |last3=Girit |first3=Caglar |last4=Hao |first4=Zhao |last5=Martin |first5=Michael C. |last6=Zettl |first6=Alex |last7=Crommie |first7=Michael F. |last8=Shen |first8=Y.

====Saturable absorption====

Such unique absorption could become saturated when the input optical intensity is above a threshold value. This nonlinear optical behavior is termed [[saturable absorption]] and the threshold value is called the saturation fluence. Graphene can be saturated readily under strong excitation over the visible to [[near-infrared]] region, due to the universal optical absorption and zero band gap. This has relevance for the mode locking of [[fiber laser]]s, where fullband mode locking has been achieved by a graphene-based saturable absorber. Due to this special property, graphene has wide application in ultrafast [[photonics]]. The optical response of graphene/graphene oxide layers can be tuned electrically.&lt;ref name="Kurum2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Potential for this high conductivity can be seen by considering graphite, a 3D version of graphene that has [[basal plane]] [[thermal conductivity]] of over {{val|1000 |u=W⋅m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} (comparable to [[diamond]]). In graphite, the c-axis (out of plane) thermal conductivity is over a factor of ≈100 smaller due to the weak binding forces between basal planes as well as the larger [[lattice spacing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=7p2pgNOWPbEC}} |title=Graphite and Precursors |last=Delhaes |first=P. |publisher=CRC Press |year=2001 |isbn=90-5699-228-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ballistic thermal conductance of graphene gives the lower limit of the ballistic thermal conductances, per unit circumference and length of carbon nanotubes.&lt;ref name="mingo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mingo |first=N. |last2=Broido |first2=D.A. |title=Carbon Nanotube Ballistic Thermal Conductance and Its Limits |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.096105 |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=95 |page=096105 |year=2005 |bibcode=2005PhRvL..95i6105M |issue=9 |pmid=16197233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its 2-D nature, graphene has 3 [[acoustic phonon]] modes. The two in-plane modes (LA, TA) have a linear [[dispersion relation]], while the out of plane mode (ZA) has a quadratic dispersion relation. Due to this, the ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dependent thermal conductivity contribution of the linear modes is dominated at low temperatures by the T&lt;sup&gt;1.5&lt;/sup&gt; contribution of the out-of-plane mode.&lt;ref name="mingo"/&gt; Some graphene phonon bands display negative [[Grüneisen parameter]]s (GPs).&lt;ref name="mounet"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mounet |first=N. |last2=Marzari |first2=N. |title=First-principles determination of the structural, vibrational and thermodynamic properties of diamond, graphite, and derivatives |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.71.205214 |journal=Physical Review B |volume=71 |page=205214 |year=2005 |arxiv=cond-mat/0412643 |bibcode=2005PhRvB..71t5214M |issue=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At low temperatures (where most optical modes with positive GPs are still not excited) the contribution from the negative GPs will be dominant and [[thermal expansion coefficient]] (which is directly proportional to GPs) negative. The lowest negative GPs correspond to the lowest transverse acoustic ZA modes. Phonon frequencies for such modes increase with the in-plane [[lattice parameter]] since atoms in the layer upon stretching will be less free to move in the z direction. This is similar to the behavior of a stretched string that has vibrations of smaller amplitude and higher frequency. This phenomenon, named "membrane effect", was predicted by [[Ilya Mikhailovich Lifshitz|Lifshitz]] in 1952.&lt;ref name="lifshitz"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lifshitz |first=I.M. |title=Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics (in Russian) |volume=22 |page=475 |year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is true of all materials, regions of graphene are subject to thermal and quantum fluctuations in relative displacement. Although the amplitude of these fluctuations is bounded in 3D structures (even in the limit of infinite size), the [[Mermin–Wagner theorem]] shows that the amplitude of long-wavelength fluctuations grows logarithmically with the scale of a 2D structure and would therefore be unbounded in structures of infinite size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nandwana|first1=Dinkar|last2=Ertekin|first2=Elif|title=Ripples, Strain, and Misfit Dislocations: Structure of Graphene–Boron Nitride Superlattice Interfaces|journal=Nano Letters|date=11 March 2015|volume=15|issue=3|pages=1468–1475|doi=10.1021/nl505005t|bibcode=2015NanoL..15.1468N}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nandwana|first1=Dinkar|last2=Ertekin|first2=Elif|title=Lattice mismatch induced ripples and wrinkles in planar graphene/boron nitride superlattices|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=21 June 2015|volume=117|issue=23|pages=234304|doi=10.1063/1.4922504|arxiv=1504.02929|bibcode=2015JAP...117w4304N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local deformation and elastic strain are negligibly affected by this long-range divergence in relative displacement.

Multiple production techniques have been developed.

{{Main|Graphene chemistry}}

Graphene is the only form of carbon (or solid material) in which every atom is available for chemical reaction from two sides (due to the 2D structure). Atoms at the edges of a graphene sheet have special chemical reactivity. Graphene has the highest ratio of edge atoms of any [[allotrope]]. Defects within a sheet increase its chemical reactivity.&lt;ref name="Denis"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Denis |first=P.

Various graphene derivatives, e.g., cyanographene and graphene acid, can be prepared via elegant chemistry of [[fluorographene]]. Cyanographene and graphene acid have high degree of functionalization (~15%), open band gap and are hydrophilic providing stable colloids in water.

A joint effort from the University of Pennsylvania, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Queensland University of Technology, and Rice University has led to the development of carbon nanotube supercapacitors that can offer three times the energy density of most carbon-based nanomaterials.

This process causes a chemical reaction which allows the material to store up to three times more energy without compromising their power density. Fuqiang Huang, a researcher on this project, reports that the fabricated carbon nanotube integrated supercapacitors are able to store up to 41 Wh/kg of energy; for comparison, an average lead acid battery has an energy density of 33 - 42 Wh/kg. Additionally, the supercapacitors offer a substantially higher power density of 70 - 250 Wh/kg compared to average lead acid battery which is capable of .2 - 1 Wh/kg. This breakthrough demonstrates that supercapacitors can provide a performance that matches, and even supersedes, of conventional energy storage methods. To put this achievement into perspective, a materials scientist from University of Pennsylvania, I-Wei Chen, stated that the implementation of these supercapacitors would allow an average bus to make 25 km trips with a recharge time of only 30 seconds.

The '''grave''' was the original name of the [[kilogram]], in an early version of the metric system between 1793 and 1795. 

==History==
The modern kilogram has its origins in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[French Revolution]]. In 1790 an influential proposal by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]] called for a new system of units, including a unit of length derived from an invariable length in nature, and a unit of mass (then called ''weight'') equal to the mass of a unit volume of water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=XkALSYqPIDYC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=meridien+la-caille+57030-toises&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G66HIBFx6i&amp;sig=jX-mW7_TInLG1ehvKw7SGIlB1kU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2496upsXMAhWIC8AKHUJuAR4Q6AEIMDAD#v=snippet&amp;q=%22great%20variety%20in%20our%22&amp;f=false May 1790 Proposal Talleyrand]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791, the Commission of Weights and Measures, appointed by the French Academy of Sciences, chose one ten-millionth of the quarter meridian as the unit of length, and named it ''[[metre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=FufDNJHvgFEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA278&amp;lpg=RA1-PA278&amp;dq=18841+grains+grave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B8Aenskenh&amp;sig=zanQ-d8GXWWN3q6bG2YBbh9bZOM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy0-C5rr7MAhWBLMAKHcG2AhwQ6AEIKTAD#v=snippet&amp;q=%22unite%20usuelle.%20on%22&amp;f=false Rapport March 17, 1791 Ten millionth of meridian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=FufDNJHvgFEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA278&amp;lpg=RA1-PA278&amp;dq=18841+grains+grave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B8Aenskenh&amp;sig=zanQ-d8GXWWN3q6bG2YBbh9bZOM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy0-C5rr7MAhWBLMAKHcG2AhwQ6AEIKTAD#v=twopage&amp;q=nommons%20metre&amp;f=false Rapport july 11, 1792 Introduction of the names metre, deci-centi-milli]&lt;/ref&gt; Initially a ''provisional'' value was used, based on the old meridian measurement by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille|Lacaille]] (1740).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=gl4vAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=metric-system+french+decimetre&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz25ypuMHMAhVCrRoKHfOTBwMQ6AEIJTAA#v=snippet&amp;q=juillet%201794&amp;f=false Decree of August 1, 1793]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793 the commission defined the unit of mass as a cubic decimetre of distilled water at 0&amp;nbsp;°C, and gave it the name ''grave''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=FufDNJHvgFEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA278&amp;lpg=RA1-PA278&amp;dq=18841+grains+grave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B8Aenskenh&amp;sig=zanQ-d8GXWWN3q6bG2YBbh9bZOM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy0-C5rr7MAhWBLMAKHcG2AhwQ6AEIKTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nom%20generique%20de%20grave%22&amp;f=false Rapport january 19, 1793 Name grave and dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Two supplemental unit names, gravet (0.001 grave), and bar (1000 grave), were added to cover the same range as the old units, resulting in the following decimal series of units: milligravet, centigravet, decigravet, gravet, centigrave, decigrave, grave, centibar, decibar, bar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=QwEOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=centigravet+decimetre&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBWoVChMI26XQ6Kb5xwIVgossCh3Isgs1#v=onepage&amp;q=centigravet%20decimetre&amp;f=false Instructions abrégée sur les mesures déduites de la grandeur de la terre et sur les calculs relatifs à leur division décimale, 1793: gravet, bar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The obsolete unit bar (1000 kg, used between 1793 and 1795) is not to be confused with the newer unit of pressure that was introduced in 1909 (100 kPa)&lt;/ref&gt; The mass of a unit volume of water at 0&amp;nbsp;°C was accurately determined by [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]] and [[René Just Haüy|Haüy]] (18841 [[Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution#Mass|grains]] per cubic provisional decimetre). A prototype of the grave was made in brass.

===After the grave===

In 1795 a new law replaced the three names gravet, grave and bar by a single generic unit name: the gram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histoire.du.metre.free.fr/en/ The 7 April 1795 Act: gramme]&lt;/ref&gt; The new gram was equal to the old gravet. Four new prefixes (deca, hecto, kilo, and myria) were added to the metric system to cover almost the same range of units as in 1793 (milligram, centigram, decigram, gram, decagram, hectogram, kilogram, myriagram).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=RSoPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=%22deux+genres+aura+son+DOUBLE+et+sa+moiti%C3%A9,+afin+de+donner+%C3%A0+la+vente%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAWoVChMIoJ3U2ZaJyAIVxNksCh0ysAvK#v=onepage&amp;q=gravet%20substituez%20gramme&amp;f=false Nouvelle instruction sur les poids et mesures, et sur le calcul décimal, adoptée par l'Agence temporaire des poids et mesures. Claude Antoine Prieur, 1795]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://smdsi.quartier-rural.org/histoire/18germ_3.htm Decree relating to the weights and measurements]&lt;/ref&gt; The brass prototype of the grave was renamed to provisional kilogram.

In 1799 the provisional units were replaced by the final ones. [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]] and [[Pierre Méchain|Méchain]] had completed their new measurement of the meridian, and the final metre was 0.03% smaller than the provisional one. Hence the final kilogram, being the mass of one cubic decimetre of water, was 0.09% lighter than the provisional one. In addition, the temperature specification of the water was changed from 0&amp;nbsp;°C to 4&amp;nbsp;°C, the point where the density of water is maximal. This change of temperature added 0.01% to the final kilogram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histoire.du.metre.free.fr/fr/index.htm L’Histoire Du Mètre, La Détermination De L’Unité De Poids]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sizes.com/units/kilogram.htm History of the kilogram]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1799 a platinum cylinder was made that served as the prototype of the final kilogram. It was called the ''Kilogramme des Archives'' as it was stored in the [[Archives Nationales (France)|Archives Nationales]] in Paris. This standard stood for the next ninety years.

{{more citations needed|date=October 2013}}
A '''horse-bus''' or '''horse-drawn [[bus|omnibus]]''' was a large, enclosed and sprung [[horse-drawn vehicle]] used for [[passenger]] transport before the introduction of [[motor vehicle]]s. It was mainly used in the late 19th century in both the United States and Europe, and was one of the most common means of transportation in cities. In a typical arrangement, two wooden benches along the sides of the passenger cabin held several sitting passengers facing each other. The driver sat on a separate, front-facing bench, typically in an elevated position outside the passengers' enclosed cabin. In the main age of horse buses, many of them were [[double-decker bus]]es. On the upper deck, which was uncovered, the longitudinal benches were arranged back to back.

[[File:Koets Breda 04.JPG|thumbnail|A Private Omnibus or 'Station Bus']]
Similar, if smaller, vehicles were often maintained at country houses (and by some hotels and railway companies) to convey servants and luggage to and from the railway station. Especially popular around 1870-1900, these vehicles were known as a 'private omnibuses' or 'station buses'; [[coachman]]-driven, they would usually accommodate four to six passengers inside, with room for luggage (and sometimes additional seating) on the roof.&lt;ref name=Smith74&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=D.J.|title=Discovering Horse-Drawn Carriages|date=1974|publisher=Shire Books Lts|location=Aylesbury, Bucks.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small open wagon with or without a top, but with an arrangement of the seats similar to horse-drawn omnibuses, was called a [[wagonette]].

==Etymology==
''Bus'' is a [[clipping (morphology)|clipped]] form of the Latin word ''omnibus''. A [[legend]] promoted by the French Transportations Museum website says the name is derived from a hatter's shop of the [[w:fr:Omnes|Omnes family]] in front of the first station opened in [[Nantes]] by Stanislas Baudry in 1823. "Omnes Omnibus" was a pun on the Latin-sounding name of that hatter Omnès: ''omnes'' (nominative plural) meaning "all" and ''omnibus'' (dative plural) meaning "for all" in [[Latin]]. Thence, the legend concludes, Nantes citizens gave the nickname of Omnibus to the vehicle.&lt;ref name="amtuir"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amtuir.org/03_htu_generale/htu_1_avant_1870/htu_1.htm |title=Histoire générale des transports |publisher=French transportations Museum Website  |accessdate=16 September 2010|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is undisputed that the term arose with Stanislas Baudry's company, there is however no record of any Omnès hatter living in that street. In 1892, the son of Baudry's bookkepeer wrote in the ''Bulletin de la Société archéologique de Nantes'' that ''omnibus'' had a simpler origin. Baudry used to call his horsecars ''Dames blanches'' (White ladies), a name which, critics told him, made no sense. He then replied, with the Latin word: "Then, these are ''omnibus'' cars!" (cars for all). The name caught up immediately. Other stories about the name origin quickly spread out.

The term 'omnibus' carried over to motor vehicles. The 1914 book ''Motor Body-building in all its Branches'', by Christopher William Terry, described an omnibus as having longitudinal seats in rows with either a rear door or side doors.&lt;ref name="motorbody"&gt;{{cite book

==History of omnibus services==
The first known [[Public transport bus service|public bus line]] (known as a "Carriage" at that time) was launched by [[Blaise Pascal]] in 1662 and was quite popular until fares were increased and access to the service was restricted to high society members by regulation. Services ceased after 15 years.&lt;ref name="amtuir"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herodote.net/histoire/evenement.php?jour=18260810 |title=Le temps de révolutions |publisher=Herodote.net |accessdate=16 September 2010|language=fr}}  Retrieved 13 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plan de la ville de Paris représentant les nouvelles voitures publiques - Entreprise générale des Dames Blanches.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Paris omnibus in 1828]]
The Paris omnibus was started in 1828 by a businessman named Stanislas Baudry, who had begun the first French omnibus line in [[Nantes]] in 1826, using two spring-suspended carriages, each for 16 passengers.&lt;ref name="Vance"&gt;{{cite book

In 1827 he commissioned an English coach-maker, [[George Shillibeer]], to design a vehicle that could be stable and carry a large number of passengers. Shillibeer's design worked.   On 28 April 1828, the first Paris omnibus began service, running every fifteen minutes between La Madeleine and la Bastille. Before long, there were one hundred omnibuses in service, with eighteen different itineraries. A journey cost twenty-five centimes. The omnibuses circulated between seven in the morning and seven in the evening; each omnibus could carry between twelve and eighteen passengers.  The busiest line was that along the Grand Boulevards; it ran from eight in the morning until midnight. {{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1031-1032}}

The Paris omnibus service was an immediate popular success, with more than two and a half million passengers in the first six months.  However,  there was no reliable way to collect money from the passengers, or the fare collectors kept much of the money for themselves;  In its first years the company was continually on the verge of bankruptcy, and in despair, Baudry committed suicide in February 1830.   Baudry's partners reorganized the company and managed to keep it in business.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1031-1032}}

In September 1828, a competing company, les Dames-Blanches, had started running its own vehicles.  In 1829 and the following years, more companies with poetic names entered the business;  les Citadines, les Tricycles, les Orléanises, les Diligentes, les Écossaises, les Béarnaises, les Carolines, les Batignollaises, les Parisiennes, les Hirondelles, les Joséphines, les Excellentes, les Sylphides, les Constantines, les Dames-Françaises,  les Algériennes, les Dames-Réunies, and les Gazelles.  The omnibus had a profound effect on Parisian life, making it possible for Parisians to work and have a social life outside their own neighborhoods.{{sfn|Héron de Villefosse|1959|page=317}}

By 1845, there were thirteen companies in Paris operating twenty-twenty three omnibus lines. In 1855, [[Napoleon III]] had them combined into a single company, the Compagnie générale des omnibus, with a monopoly on Paris public transportation. Beginning in 1873, they were gradually replaced by tramways, and, beginning in 1906, by the ''omnibus automobile'', or motor bus. The last horse-drawn Paris omnibus ran on 11 January 1913, from Saint-Sulpice to La Villette.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1031-1032}}

In Britain, [[John Greenwood (bus operator)|John Greenwood]] opened the first bus line in Britain in [[Manchester]] in 1824. His pioneering idea was to offer a service where, unlike with a [[Stagecoaches|stagecoach]], no prior booking was necessary and the driver would pick up or set down passengers anywhere on request.

[[File:Shillibeer's first omnibus.png|thumb|George Shillibeer's first London omnibus, 1829]]
Buses have been used on the streets of London since 1829. [[George Shillibeer]] saw the success of the Paris omnibus in service and concluded that operating similar vehicles in London. His first London "Omnibus", using the same design and name as the Paris vehicle, took up service on 4 July 1829 on the route between [[Paddington]] (The [[Yorkshire Stingo]]) and "Bank" ([[Bank of England]]) via the "[[New Road (eighteenth century north London turnpike road)|New Road]]" (now [[Marylebone Road|Marylebone Rd]]), [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]] and [[City Road]]. Four services were provided in each direction daily. Shillibeer's success prompted many competitors to enter the market, and for a time buses were referred to as 'Shillibeers'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://knowledgeoflondon.com/buses.html|title=The London Omnibus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shillibeer built another bus for the [[Quaker]] [[Newington Academy for Girls]] near London; this had a total of 25 seats, and entered history as the first [[school bus]].

In 1850 [[Thomas Tilling]] started [[horse bus]] services,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petergould.co.uk/local_transport_history/pioneers/people/tilling.htm Thomas Tilling by Peter Gould]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1855 the [[London General Omnibus Company]] or LGOC was founded to amalgamate and regulate the horse-drawn omnibus services then operating in London.&lt;ref name="ltm1829"&gt;{{cite web | title = From omnibus to ecobus, 1829-1850  | url = http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/learning/online_resources/ecobus_omnibus/pg/1829.htm | publisher = [[London Transport Museum]] | accessdate = 3 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070609023652/http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/learning/online_resources/ecobus_omnibus/pg/1829.htm |archivedate = 9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1973-030C-18, Pferdeomnibus, Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin horsebus]]
The public transport system of Berlin is the oldest one in Germany. In 1825 the first bus line from [[Brandenburger Tor]] to [[Charlottenburg]] was opened by Simon Kremser, running to a [[Public transport timetable|timetable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textagentur-grimm.de/kremser.html Textagentur-Grimm.de: Simon Kremser]&lt;/ref&gt; The first bus service inside the city operated from 1840 between [[Alexanderplatz]] and [[Berlin Potsdamer Bahnhof|Potsdamer Bahnhof]]. It was run by Israel Moses Henoch, who had organized the cab service since 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Elfi Bendikat: {{Google books |id=X4j4rJSvACoC |page=103 |title=Öffentliche Nahverkehrspolitik in Berlin und Paris 1839 bis 1914 }} (Walter de Gruyter), Seite 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceciliengaerten-berlin.de/web/zeitrahmen/1800_1899.html Cecilengarten Berlin: Zeitrahmen&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 1, 1847, the ''Concessionierte Berliner Omnibus Compagnie'' (Concessed Berlin Bus Company) started its first horse-bus line. The growing market experienced the launch of numerous additional companies, with 36 bus companies in Berlin by 1864.

From the end of the 1820s, the first horse-drawn omnibuses ran in the streets of [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transitmuseumeducation.org/trc/background New York Transit Museum: History of Public Transportation in New York City]&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses pulling buses could only work for limited hours per day, had to be housed, groomed, fed and cared for every day, and produced large amounts of manure, which the omnibus company had to store and dispose of. Since a typical horse pulled a bus for four or five hours per day, covering about a dozen miles, many systems needed ten or more horses in stable for each bus.

With the advent of mass-produced steel (at around 1860), horse-buses were put on rails as the same horse could then move 3 to 10 times as many people. This was not only more efficient, but faster and produced, in an age of unpaved streets, a far superior ride.

These horse-cars on rails were converted to cable-drawn cars in larger cities, as still exist in San Francisco, the underground cable being drawn by stationary steam engines.

(Not to be overlooked was the establishment in both London and New York, of steam hauled urban railways, either underground or on elevated structures. These metropolitan railways are where the present term "Metro" began. These systems provided "rapid transit" on their routes).

At around 1890, electric propulsion became practical and replaced both the horse and the cable and the number of traction lines on rails expanded exponentially. (This was seen as a huge advance in urban transport and considered a wise investment at that time). These became known as Streetcars, Trams, Trolleys and still exist in many cities today, though often having been replaced by the less infrastructure intensive motorbus as driven by an internal combustion engine.

[[File:Hestetrukken omnibus på Strøget.jpg|thumb|upright|Horsebus in Copenhagen, 1907]]
From the beginning of the twentieth century the remaining horse buses which had not been converted to rail began to be replaced by petrol-driven motor [[bus]]es, or autobuses. The last recorded horse omnibus in London was a Tilling bus which last ran, between Peckham and Honor Oak Tavern, on 4 August 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/postcodes/places/SE15.html|title=Riding on a knifeboard|work=London Museum|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202005111/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/postcodes/places/SE15.html|archivedate=2012-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Berlin horse omnibus ran on 25 August 1923. Some horse buses remain in use today for tourist sightseeing tours.

===Flapping wing propulsion===
Flapping wing propulsion devices are hydrofoils that generate propulsion by forcing a foil to move up and down in the water. The forward motion of the foil then generates lift as in other hydrofoils. A common design consists of a large foil at the [[stern]] that is used both for propulsion and keeping the passenger above the water, connected to a smaller foil at the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] used for steering and longitudinal stability. Riders operate the vehicle by bouncing up and down on a small platform at the stern, whilst holding onto a steering column.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Jesse Holman Jones''' (April 5, 1874{{spaced ndash}}June 1, 1956) was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politician and entrepreneur from [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. He served as [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] from 1940 to 1945.

Jones managed a Tennessee [[tobacco]] factory at age fourteen, and at nineteen, he was put in charge of his uncle's lumberyards. Five years later, after his uncle, M. T. Jones, died, Jones moved to Houston to manage his uncle's estate and opened a [[lumberyard]] company, which grew quickly. During this period, Jesse opened his own business, the South Texas Lumber Company. He also began to expand into real estate, commercial building, and banking.&lt;ref name="THO"&gt;{{cite web|series=Handbook of Texas|title=Jones, Jesse Holman|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fjo53|access-date=October 13, 2017|author=Lionel V. Patenaude|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His commercial building activities in Houston included mid-rise and skyscraper office buildings, hotels and apartments, and movie theaters. He constructed the Foster Building, home to the ''Houston Chronicle'', in exchange for a fifty percent share in the newspaper, which he acquired control of in 1926.

Jones's participation in civic life and politics began with the Port of Houston and the Houston Ship Channel. He led a group of local bankers in buying public finance bonds and was later appointed to serve as the Chair of the Houston Harbor Board. He led a local fundraising effort on behalf of the American Red Cross in support of servicemen in World War I. President Wilson tapped Jones to head a division of American Red Cross, a duty he fulfilled between 1917 and 1919. In 1928, he initiated and organized Houston's bid for the 1928 Democratic National Convention.

His most important role was on the board of the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC), (1932–1939), a federal agency originally created in the [[Herbert Hoover]] administration that played a major role in combating the Great Depression and financing industrial expansion during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=Joseph R. |title=The Political Economy of Reconstruction Finance Corporation Assistance During the Great Depression |journal=Explorations in Economic History |year=2003 |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=101–121 |doi=10.1016/S0014-4983(03)00013-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Roosevelt elevated Jones to the Chairmanship of the RFC in 1933. Jones was in charge of spending US$50 billion, especially in financing railways and building munitions factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koistinen |first=Paul A. C. |title=Arsenal of World War II: The Political Economy of American Warfare, 1940-1945 |year=2004 |location=Lawrence |publisher=University Press of Kansas |isbn=0700613080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2018}} He served as the United States Secretary of Commerce from 1940{{endash}}1945, a post he held concurrently with his chairmanship of the RFC. After leaving Washington, Jesse and Mary Jones focused on philanthropy, working through the Houston Endowment, a non-profit corporation they founded in 1937.

==Family history and early life==
[[File:Sudley Place.jpg|thumb|right|Sudley Place in Tennessee, Jones's childhood home, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.]]
[[File:Jesse jones 17.png|thumb|Portrait of Jones at the age of seventeen (c. 1891)]]
Jesse H. Jones descended from Welsh ancestors who made [[Virginia]] their first landing place in North America, sometime in the 1650s. After settling there briefly, they relocated to the [[Chowan River]] in [[North Carolina]], remaining there for at least a century. In 1774, Eli Jones and one of his brothers, headed west, eventually deciding to an area now known as [[Robertson County, Tennessee]]. William, one of Eli's sons, established himself as a farmer there, and married a neighboring farmer's daughter, Laura Anna Holman. The farm was sufficient to provide for all of the needs of the family and grow tobacco for sale, partly from their own efforts, and partly from the work of enslaved persons. Jesse Holman Jones was born to William and Laura Jones on April 5, 1874, the fourth of five children.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 7{{endash}}8.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse's mother died on April 22, 1880, just after he had turned six. Nancy Jones Hurt, his aunt, moved in with the family along with her two sons. She was a "guide, physician, and clothes-maker of all the Jones children," and "a famous cook. ... "&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sudley Place]] was his childhood home.&lt;ref name="npsform"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory--Nomination Form: Sudley Place|url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/5de81f3e-d86c-440c-8126-df7dec975ebd|website=National Park Service|publisher=United States Department of the Interior|accessdate=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883, the Jones family, including Aunt Nancy and seven children moved to [[Dallas, Texas]], partly in order for William to join his brother Martin Tilton "M.T." Jones in his successful lumber enterprise. Several years earlier M.T. had resettled his family in [[Terrell, Texas]] after a stop in [[Illinois]]. Aunt Nancy remained in Dallas and enrolled the children in local public schools, while William moved to Terrell to manage the M.T. Jones Lumber Company and look after the firm's other lumberyards in northeast Texas. This allowed M.T. to move closer to his timberlands and other interests in southeast Texas. However, William only stayed for two years and returned with his large family to Robertson County, where he acquired a new farm to work.  So Jesse was back in Tennessee at the age of twelve.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 13{{endash}}15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesse had been a diligent worker as a boy, caring for the farm animals, and performing many common household chores. During the summers when his family had lived in Dallas{{emdash}}when he was a young teenager{{emdash}}he hacked out weeds, picked cotton, and herded cattle. He did not display the same diligence for school, and later, Jesse recalled many scoldings and punishments from his teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 11{{endash}}15.&lt;/ref&gt; His father challenged his two sons with a tobacco plot for each of them. He allowed each son to three acres and provided them both with supplies. Each of them would be allowed to keep any profits after they repaid their store accounts. After the eighth grade, he quit school and applied some of his experience working with tobacco. William Jones not only grew tobacco, but also traded the crop, and he also joined a partnership, Jones, Holman and Armstrong, which processed tobacco. Then, out of school at the age of fourteen, Jesse was in the job market, and William put him in charge of one of the tobacco factories. Jesse was responsible for receiving (or sometimes rejecting), classifying, warehousing, and shipping tobacco. In addition, his name was on the company bank account, and he signed checks for the company's operations.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 16{{endash}}19.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of seventeen, Jesse's family returned to Dallas. After several attempts to find a suitable job in Dallas and the surrounding region, Jesse started working in [[Hillsboro, Texas]], at one of his uncle's lumberyards. He performed manual labor, but also served the office side of the business, such as bookkeeping and debt collection. Despite these varied duties, he earned the standard salary for a salesman: $40 per month. He requested a fifty percent raise, arguing that he worked day and night. His uncle refused. Jesse quit not long before the death of his father, William Jones. The will instructed that trustees manage the tobacco enterprise, while Jesse would assume control at age twenty-one. He also inherited about $2,000 in stock.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 20{{endash}}23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business activities==
===Timber and lumber===

Jesse and his brother had liquidated the tobacco inventory from their father's estate, and spent the proceeds on their sisters' homes. Jesse returned to Dallas and applied for a position with the M.T. Jones Lumber Company's yard on Main Street and St. Paul. However, he had experienced problems with the manager of the yard at Hillsboro, and that manager then worked at the big yard in downtown Dallas. His uncle M.T. refused to hire him, leading Jesse to wonder what the manager might have said about him. However, C.T. Harris, the general manager of the company decided to investigate the matter. Harris was familiar with Jesse's work, and had even on occasion, entrusted him to keep the books. Harris audited the books of the Hillsboro yard and concluded that the Hillsboro manager had committed fraud. He fired the manager and hired Jesse as bookkeeper for the big Dallas yard. Initially, Jesse earned a salary of $15 per week{{emdash}}more than he made at the Hillsboro yard. After just six months, Harris made Jesse the manager there, raising his salary to $100 per month ({{Inflation|US|100|1895|2016|r=-2|fmt=eq}}). Harris made these decisions without consulting M.T., the owner of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse ran the Dallas yard profitably, even in the face of eight competitors in the local market. In 1895, with M.T. still critical of the Dallas operations, Jesse tendered his resignation. However, M.T. audited the books of the Dallas yard and found them to be in good order. M.T. asked Jesse to retract his resignation. Jesse replied that he would take his old job back for $150 per week and six percent of the profits. M.T. agreed to Jesse's terms.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 28{{endash}}30.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Jesse was still managing a lumber yard in Dallas for M.T. Jones, he decided on a financial gambit while competing for the lumber trade related to the 1897 Texas State Fair. The association running the State Fair needed construction supplies for buildings and exhibits, but the lumber companies wanted personal guarantees from the directors. Jesse, sensing an opportunity, decided to stand out from his competitors: he extended credit to the State Fair Association, with only the backing of gate receipts. When M.T. found out about the terms of the loans and the full extent of Jesse's gamble, he began to investigate Jesse's activities and interrogated him about his decision. These loans were repaid quickly and the Dallas lumber yard profited from the play.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 30{{endash}}32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these confrontation between M.T. and Jesse, by 1898, it was apparent that Jesse had earned his uncle's trust. M.T. died that year and his will named Jesse as general manager of his substantial lumber business.&lt;ref&gt;Buenger (2003), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The will also designated Jesse as one of five executors of his estate. He arrived in Houston in 1898, renting a room at the [[Rice Lofts#First Rice Hotel building|old Rice Hotel]] for $2.25 per night ({{Inflation|US|2.25|1898|2016|r=0|fmt=eq}}). He was then responsible for the business affairs of his Aunt Louisa and his three cousins. Jesse managed a large estate:&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was now in charge of tens of thousands of acres of timberland spread over three east Texas counties and parts of Louisiana. The estate owned and operated sawmills and factories in Orange that had the daily capacity to turn hundreds of thousands of feet of raw timber into shingles, doors, windows sashes, and two-by-fours. The logistics was equally huge: felled trees had to moved to plants, and finished products had to be delivered to lumberyards located throughout the state and beyond. With assistance and advice from trustees, Jones bought, sold, and managed the land, expanding the M.T. Jones Lumber Company even further.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Jones lumber company.png|thumb|Photograph of Jesse H. Jones Lumber Company, circa 1903]]
In 1902, Jones started the South Texas Lumber Company. He had money he had earned from selling investments in timber and some Spindletop deals for capital. He acquired the Reynolds Lumber Company, as well as many other lumberyards in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. The company charter announced an intention to purchase raw goods (lumber), semi-finished goods (cross ties), and milled goods, such as blinds, doors, and sash.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his own recollection, he made about $1 million in profits when he sold controlling interest in the company, liquidating most of his interests in one saw mill and perhaps 20 or more lumberyards. Other than retaining a single lumberyard, he permanently left active management of the timber and lumber business in 1911 or 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction and real estate===

[[File:Gulf Building.jpg|thumb|JP Morgan Chase Bank Building, formerly the Gulf Building, Houston]]

Jones commenced a flurry of building activity in 1906. He contracted to build an addition to the Bristol Hotel, committing $90,000 ({{Inflation|US-GDP|90000|1906|2016|r=-5|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}) to the project, which would include a rooftop garden and dance floor. He also commissioned a ten-story building for the [[Texaco|Texas Company (Texaco)]], and the company moved its headquarters to Houston. The same year, he constructed a new plant for the rapidly growing ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' in exchange for a half-interest in the company, which had been solely owned by Marcellus Foster.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 44{{endash}}46.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, Jones purchased the original five-story Rice Hotel from [[Rice University]] although the university retained the land on which it stood. Working with [[James A. Baker (born 1857)|James A. Baker]], the president of Rice Institute's Board of Trustee's, he razed the original structures and constructed the seventeen-story building, which he then leased from Rice. The new hotel leased 500 rooms, and was the center of Houston social life.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 50{{endash}}52.&lt;/ref&gt;

After concluding his service with the Red Cross, Jones returned to Houston and resumed his business activities. He amassed lots along the Main Street corridor in downtown Houston, acquired a tract on Elm Street in Dallas, and also invested in [[Forth Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]].&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, he expanding one downtown Houston structure into the [[Bankers Mortgage Building]], while laying out plans for two more ten-story buildings. During this time he continued a collaboration with local architect [[Alfred C. Finn]], whom he had first worked with on the Rice Hotel. Jones juggled his Houston program with a development initiative in New York City, and he built the [[Melba Theater]] in Dallas.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 104{{endash}}105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1920s, Jones increased his construction and development activity. Two new buildings, the Kirby Theater and the Kirby Lumber Company Building went up on Main Street, while he built additions to the Rice Hotel and the Houston Electric Building. During the same period he started projects in [[Manhattan]]. The first was an apartment building on Fifth Avenue at 97th Street, followed by the [[Mayfair House (New York City)]] on Park Avenue at 67th Street. A third building at 200 Madison Avenue faced [[J.P. Morgan]]'s home, with four floors leased to the first [[Marshall Field's]] store in New York City. Jones also left his mark on Fort Worth, building the [[Medical Arts Building (Fort Worth)]], and the Worth Hotel and Worth Theater.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 125{{endash}}127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his real estate and political activity associated with Houston's Democratic National Convention, Jones continued multiple development projects in 1928 in other cities. He commissioned an eighteen-story, mixed-use building in downtown Fort Worth, leasing the storefront and two more floors to Fair Department Store. He cited a sixteen-story medical office building on 61st street as just one of his projects in New York. Back in Houston, several projects were under construction with no connection to the convention. Jones broke ground on the Gulf Building that year, while completing the Levy Brothers Department Store. The Gulf Building was completed the next year as the tallest structure in Houston, a distinction it held until 1963. He finished another retail building on Main Street, a four-story store for Krupp and Tuffly Shoes. He acquired his fourth hotel, a distressed sixteen-story building which he re-branded as the Texas State Hotel. His largest project to date, however, Jones built in New York: a 44-story office tower on East 40th Street. This he completed in the spring prior to the [[Stock Market Crash of 1929]].&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 169{{endash}}173.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banking===
[[File:National Bank of Commerce 3Oct18 Bank advertisement, Houston, Texas.png|thumb|National Bank of Commerce advertising sale of Liberty Bonds, 1918]]
As a young man, Jones found opportunities to borrow money in order to establish credit. He borrowed in excess of his need, and kept the extra cash in a savings account.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at least two Houston bankers expressed concerns about his borrowing practices. By his own estimate, he had borrowed as much as $3 million ({{Inflation|US-GDP|3,000,000|1906|2016|r=-5|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}). The test came with the [[Panic of 1907]]. One of the largest and oldest of Houston's banks, the T.W House Bank, failed amidst this economic recession. The bank had a $500,000 ({{Inflation|US-GDP|500,000|1907|2016|r=-5|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}) loan on its books in the name of Jesse Jones. Yet even during the bank panic, Jones was able to sell enough mortgage paper and draw on lines of credit to repay the loan. So he stood ready to make new investments after the worst of the recession ended.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp.44{{endash}}46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime after 1908, Jones organized the Texas Trust Company. By 1912, he had become president of Houston's National Bank of Commerce. This bank later merged with Texas National Bank in 1964 to become the Texas National Bank of Commerce, renamed to [[Texas Commerce Bank]] which grew into a major regional financial institution. It became part of JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. in 2008.&lt;ref name=THO/&gt;

In 1931 two local banks were in danger of failing. Public National Bank faced a clientele demanding cash and Houston National Bank had too many distressed loans. Public National Bank had barely enough cash on hand to last through Saturday, October 24. The next day, Jones hosted at meeting of local bankers at his office in the new Gulf Building. He urged his banking colleagues to assist in stabilizing the two distressed banks to prevent a general panic among local depositors. Jones proposed a bailout plan of $1.25 million ({{Inflation|US-GDP|1,250,000|1931|2016|r=-5|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}) to guarantee local deposits at risk, with the political support of a major local bank investor, [[James A. Baker (born 1857)|James A. Baker]]. Despite a faction of bankers who wanted to let the two banks fail, Jones and Baker prevailed, with Jones buying out Public National Bank, Joseph Meyers Interests buying out Houston National Bank, and a consortium of banks and utility companies all contributing to the bailout fund.  Customers of Public National Bank gained access to their accounts on October 26.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 181–183.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publishing===
[[File:Jessehjonesplaque.jpg|thumb|Quote from Jones at the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' headquarters (former ''[[Houston Post]]'' building)]]
Jones acquired his fifty-percent interest in the ''Houston Chronicle'' from Marcellus Elliot Foster in August 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foster&gt;{{cite web|series=Handbook of Texas|title=Foster, Marcellus Elliot|date=February 15, 2017|access-date=October 2, 2018|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|last=Lucko|first=Paul M.|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ffo52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Foster was the paper's editor, Jones's engagement in the paper's positions was evident by the letters between the two men. For example, Jones supported Foster's public opposition to the Ku Klux Klan, which had been a growing movement in Texas after World War I. Foster stressed his editorial independence, while Jones vowed that he was willing to risk financial loss and personal safety to side against the KKK.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 106{{endash}}107.&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship became strained in 1925 when Jones voiced his opposition to Foster's support of [[Miriam Ferguson]] for governor of Texas. They were in agreement with her strong stance against the Klan, but Jones refused to support her candidacy because of the corruption of her husband during his tenure as governor.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 124{{endash}}125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Jones became the sole owner of the ''Houston Chronicle'' and named himself as publisher. At the time of the purchase, the paper had a daily readership of 75,000 and the company was valued at $2.5 million ({{inflation|index=US-GDP|start_year=1926|end_year=2016|value=2,500,000|r=-6|fmt=eq|cur=$}}).&lt;ref name=foster/&gt; When Jones opened the Gulf Building in Houston, his ownership of the ''Houston Chronicle'' facilitated publication of a 48-page special insert dedicated to his new skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1930, Jones acquired a radio station and began broadcasting in Houston from the Rice Hotel. The call letters of the station, KTRH, used three letters as an acronym for '''T'''he '''R'''ice '''H'''otel. KTRH broadcast some content of the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]], making it the second radio station in Houston to air national programs. Jones established the station to support the ''Houston Chronicle'', which had already seen the ''[[Houston Post]]'' establish a radio affiliate, KPRC.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activities==
===Houston Ship Channel===
[[File:Cotton on the Ship Channel, Houston, Texas (1914).jpg|thumb|Postcard depicting a cotton-laden ship, Houston Ship Channel, 1914]]
Jones helped to secure funding for the [[Port of Houston|Houston Ship Channel]]. When bond sales for the Harris County Houston Ship Channel District lagged, he met with Houston bankers and extracted a pledge from each one to buy the district's bonds proportionate to their market capitalizations. He was appointed as chair of the new Houston Harbor Board in 1913 by Mayor Ben Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;Sibley (1968), pp. 137{{endash}}138.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones accepted this post after rejecting several offers from the [[Woodrow Wilson]] Administration the same year. [[Edward Mandell House]], who advocated Wilson's nomination for the Democratic Party the previous year, suggested Jones for service to the new US President. The Wilson Administration offered positions to Jones such as the Undersecretary of the Treasury, two ambassadorships, and most notably, Secretary of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 51{{endash}}52.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones confronted Mayor Campbell and other interests in regard to a wharf in Manchester, at that time outside of the City of Houston. Campbell advocated spending $300,000 of Houston Harbor District revenue to construct a wharf for a local cement manufacturer. Jones opposed this expenditure, and resigned from the board with other directors when the city approved the project.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Red Cross===
[[File:Jesse jones red cross.png|thumb|Jones in his Red Cross uniform, 1918]]
From 1917 until the end of World War II, Jones dedicated his activities to the nation, spending more time in the federal capital than in his home town.&lt;ref&gt;Buenger (2003), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He responded to World War I demands by leading a fundraising effort in Houston for the American Red Cross.  Sixteen of his friends accepted his challenge to donate $5,000 each ({{Inflation|US-GDP|5,000|1917|2016|r=-5|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}), spurring the local effort to meet and exceed its fundraising quota.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; President Wilson asked Jones to become director general of military relief for the [[American Red Cross]] during [[World War I]], a position he held until 1919.&lt;ref name="THO"/&gt; During his first post in Washington, D.C., his department was responsible for seven hundred Red Cross canteens and 55,000 volunteers, organization and transportation of mobile hospitals to England and France, and distribution of clothing to persons in war-torn Europe, and tendering financial assistance to families of American servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones worked in an office building facing the White House, and eventually he had personal access to the President. During the coordination of Red Cross parades in various American cities, he asked that the President make a speech on the day of the parade in New York City to support fundraising efforts. Wilson was reticent and had not made an oral public address since his declaration of war against Germany. Jones, per Wilson's request, appointed Cleveland Dodge as the presiding officer of the event, though Jones also directed Dodge to choose a venue suitable for a presidential address. On the day of the parade, President Wilson made an impromptu speech to a full Metropolitan Opera House which included his justification for war against Germany, lauded the work of the American Red Cross, admonished Wall Street bankers against wartime profiteering, and offered an entreaty to Americans to donate money to the Red Cross.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 74–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1928 Democratic National Convention===
On his own initiative, Jones tendered a $200,000 bid ({{Inflation|US-GDP|200,000|1928|2016|r=-5|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}) to bring the [[1928 Democratic National Convention]] to Houston. Other cities matched or exceeded this amount, but Jones vowed that Houston would beat the others in hospitality. When Jones returned to Texas from Washington, D.C., where he had been negotiating, local greeters mobbed the train depots in [[Marshall, Texas]] and [[Conroe, Texas|Conroe]], with a few brandishing "Jesse Jones for President" signs. At [[Union Station (Houston)|Union Station]], 50,000 Houstonians staged a homecoming for Jones, replete with marching bands, bunting, and banners. They staged a parade from Union Station to the Jones home at the Lamar Hotel. This hero's welcome preceded the decision by the Democratic Convention to select a site, though [[Walter Lippman]] and the ''New York Evening Post'' predicted that Houston would be chosen.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 136–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction Finance Corporation===

[[Image:JesseHolmanJonesAtDesk.jpg|thumb|Jesse Holman Jones]]
[[File:Jesse Jones takes oath as Federal Loan Administrator. Washington, D.C., July 17. Jesse Jones, retiring Chairman of the RFC today was sworn in as Federal Loan Administrator by Ronald H. LCCN2016875956.jpg|thumb|Jones takes oath as Federal Loan Administrator, July 17, 1939]] 
After [[Herbert Hoover|President Hoover]] signed the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) bill in 1932, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] chose Jones as one of the three to serve on its first board of directors. When Hoover sought advice from ranking Democrats about candidates for the board, Jones was the sole recommendation of House Speaker [[John Nance Garner]].&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 186{{endash}}187.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hoover RFC was an ambitious program. Upon opening, the RFC had 300 staff positions available. Soon it conveyed hundreds of millions in loans, including $300 million ({{Inflation|US-GDP|300,000,000|1932|2016|r=-8|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}) to the railroads, $90 million to prop up the Chicago bank of Charles Dawes, and $65 million to Bank of America. However, Hoover sold the RFC as a program to assist smaller institutions. Bank of America retired its loan with the RFC, paying interest and principal within two years. Other loans were not successful. Jones opposed a loan to the Missouri Pacific, concerned that that the taxpayers would be stuck with their bill. Without Jones's support, the RFC board approved $23 million for the railroad, but it did not prevent the company from failing the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 188– 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] made him the Chairman of the RFC, while also expanding the RFC's powers to make loans and bail out banks. This led some to refer to Jones as "the fourth branch of government."&lt;ref name="brother"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/jessejones/jesse_bio3.htm|title=Brother, Can You Spare A Billion? The Story of Jesse H. Jones|publisher=PBS and Houston Public Media|access-date=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Congress issued an additional $850 in loans, after which President Roosevelt intimated to Jones that he would have the authority to invest the new appropriations and reinvest revenue from loan repayments.&lt;ref&gt;Olson (1988), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones criticized Hoover's execution of the RFC as too little and too late. Congress and the new president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, created a new Emergency Banking Act on March 9, 1933. President Roosevelt announced a "bank holiday," a moratorium on banking activity while federal bank inspectors examined the books in order to determine which financial institutions were viable. After the bank holiday, all financially sound banks would resume business. For persons who were unable to access their accounts, another part of the act authorized the executive branch to reorganize failed banks in order to free up frozen assets. The RFC was empowered to invest financial institution through their preferred stocks. Seventy percent of America's banks reopened after just six days. Jones's task as the new chair of the RFC was to reopen another 2,000 banks. He began with the reorganization of two of Detroit's largest banks by collaborating with [[Alfred P. Sloan]] of [[General Motors]]. They formed a new bank with matching investments from the RFC and General Motors, but more significantly, the RFC covered the deposits of the 800,000 frozen accounts from both failed banks with a loan of $230 million ({{Inflation|US-GDP|230,000,000|1933|2016|r=-8|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}).&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 201–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first three years of the Roosevelt Administration, the RFC had issued $8 billion in loans; however, these outflows were offset by $3.5 billion in revenues, including interest payments and repayments of principal.&lt;ref&gt;Olson (1988), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Roosevelt appointed Jones to be the new Federal Loan Administrator while taking away his title as RFC chair.&lt;ref&gt;Olson (1988), pp. 210{{endash}}211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt reportedly called Jones "Jesus H. Jones."&lt;ref&gt;Merle Miller. ''Plain Speaking: An Oral Biography of Harry S. Truman'' (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2018}}

===Secretary of Commerce===
President [[Woodrow Wilson]] offered Jones the position of [[United States Secretary of Commerce]], but Jones decided instead to remain in Houston and focus on his businesses.&lt;ref name="brother" /&gt; He accepted the same position from President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1940, and he served until 1945.&lt;ref name="THO" /&gt; However, according to Stephen Fenberg, Roosevelt offered him the cabinet position to bring him closer to the White House and reign in his power. This tactic did not work because Jones accepted the new post while retaining his old job as Federal Loan Administrator.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exit from Washington===
Henry Wallace was dropped from the ticket as Vice President in 1944. Jones was on the short list to replace him.  However Roosevelt wanted social progress to continue and Jones's reputation was far too conservative for that role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Daniels|title=Franklin D. Roosevelt: The War Years, 1939-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNCyCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81|year=2016|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roosevelt was reelected and asked Jones to resign as Secretary of Commerce, which he did on January 21, 1945. The next day he resigned from RFC and all other government positions.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 502{{endash}}512.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jones released the two letters to several newspapers, including ''The New York Times''. The letters criticized Roosevelt's decision to name Wallace as Secretary of Commerce.  Senator Josiah Bailey of North Carolina called both Jones and Wallace to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee, each on consecutive days. Jones testified on the first day that he did not believe that Wallace was a suitable candidate. He characterized Wallace as a visionary who lacked business experience. Sometime during the five hours of testimony the next day, Wallace touted his own business experience, but sought to restrict the scope of power from the Commerce Department and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which he claimed were exploited by business interests.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 515{{endash}}518.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suite 8F Group===
Jones was associated with a group of Houston political and social leaders known as the ''Suite 8F Group'', named for the apartment number at the Lamar Hotel maintained by George and Herman Brown.  Jones owned the hotel and resided in the building's penthouse, upstairs from the Brown's suite. The principal members of this group were James Abercrombie, the Brown brothers, [[James A. Elkins|Judge James Elkins]], [[Oveta Culp Hobby]], [[William P. Hobby]], Robert E. Smith, and [[Gus Wortham]].  Historian Joseph Pratt characterized Jones as "the godfather" of the group. The Suite 8F Group began their activities after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pratt, Joseph|title=8F and Many More: Business and Civic Leadership in Modern Houston|journal=Houston History|volume=1|issue=2|year=2004|url=https://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/8F-HH-1.2-optimized.pdf|accessdate=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy and non-profits==
Prior to 1937, Jesse and Mary Jones and given about $1 million to charitable causes. In 1937, they established the Houston Endowment to organize their philanthropic endeavors. Their Commerce Company was already established as a conglomeration of most of the family business interests. They granted about a third of the company's shares to the Houston Endowment, while appointing Milton Backlund, Fred Heyne, and W. W. Moore as the first trustees. During the first seven years, Houston Endowment focused its donations on education.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp.291–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1932, Jones had not cashed any paychecks he earned through his various federal government positions through 1945. In 1946, he signed them all over to the Houston Endowment.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Jones and his wife worked through the Houston Endowment to give this money away, much of it with a focus on education. Through the Houston Endowment, they made a $300,000 grant to the University of Virginia in honor of Woodrow Wilson. They established scholarship funds for the [[Texas State College for Women]], [[Prairie View A &amp; M University]], the [[University of Tennessee]], and [[Texas A &amp; M University]].&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 531{{endash}}534.&lt;/ref&gt; Later they created an engineering scholarship at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] honoring [[William S. Knudsen|Bill Knudsen]] and an economics scholarship at [[Austin College]] honoring Jesse's brother, John.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 538.&lt;/ref&gt; More ten-year scholarship programs funded students attending Rice University and Texas A &amp; M, and several of the individual recipients were veterans of World War II. Another program supported nursing candidates at the [[University of Houston]].&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 545{{endash}}546.&lt;/ref&gt; They also made large gifts to the American Red Cross, the Houston Community Chest, the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, and the United Jewish Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 534{{endash}}535.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Jones joined the Board of Trustees of the Texas Medical Center.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott (2004), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the Jesse Holman Jones Hospital was built in [[Springfield, Tennessee]] to replace the original hospital there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|access-date=October 19, 2018|url=https://www.robertsoncountyconnection.com/news/history---robertson-county-hospital/article_307cdc0c-a0d0-55e4-bc78-f4b5f644c165.html|date=January 3, 2016|first=Bill|last=Jones|work=The Connection|title=History-Robertson County Hospital}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones made a gift of $1 million to Rice University to establish [[Jones College (Rice University)|Jones College]], which opened in 1957. The name for the all-women's dormitories honored Mary Gibbs Jones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jones.rice.edu/history/||title=Jones College: History|access-date=October 19, 2018|publisher=Rice University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
In 1925, Jones received an honorary Doctor of Law degree from [[Southwestern University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jesse Jones to Speak at Centennial Celebration|work=The Megaphone|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth601326/m1/1/?q=%22jesse%20jones%22|access-date=October 19, 2018|via=Portal to Texas Online|date=March 12, 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another from [[Oglethorpe University]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary Degrees Awarded by Oglethorpe University |publisher=Oglethorpe University |url=http://www.oglethorpe.edu/about_us/history/honorary_degrees.asp |accessdate=2015-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319104000/http://www.oglethorpe.edu/about_us/history/honorary_degrees.asp |archivedate=2015-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the [[Alabama-Coushatta]] tribe named Jones ''Chief Cue-ya-la-na'' when they accepted him into their community. The name translates as "Yellow Pine," symbolic of the tallest being within their local environment and a being which serves all members of their community.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Louisa jones house.png|thumb|The Houston home of Louisa Jones]]
Jones resided at the Rice Hotel in Houston, but he also stayed at "the Boarding House," the home of his aunt, Louisa Jones. Her house was located at the corner of Anita and Main Street, south of downtown Houston. Jones managed the estate of his uncle, M. T. Jones, and continued to act as a business manager for his aunt and his cousins for many years. Much of his social life revolved around them, too. His future wife, Mary Gibbs Jones, was first married to his cousin, Will Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), pp. 40{{endash}}42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones married Mary Gibbs on December 15, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; They resided at the Rice Hotel until 1926 when they moved into their penthouse at the new Lamar Hotel. Alfred C. Finn designed and supervised the construction of the building, but Jones hired [[John Staub]] to design the interior for their apartment. Audrey Jones, one of Mary's granddaughters, also lived with them.&lt;ref&gt;Fenberg (2011), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones retained the title of publisher of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' until his death on June 1, 1956, at the age of 82. His remains were interred in Houston's Forest Park Cemetery.&lt;ref name="THO" /&gt;

The name of Jesse H. Jones is memorialized throughout Houston through many grants from the Houston Endowment. The home of the Houston Symphony is Jesse H. [[Jones Hall]] in the [[Houston Theater District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|publisher=City of Houston|title=Jones Hall for the Performing Arts |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125112644/http://www.houstontx.gov/joneshall/general.htm |date=January 25, 2010|access-date=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.houstonsymphony.org/celebrating-50-years-jones-hall/|publisher=The Houston Symphony|title=Celebrating 50 Years in Jones Hall|date=October 3, 2016|access-date=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Puzzles}}
A '''jigsaw puzzle''' is a [[tiling puzzle]] that requires the assembly of often oddly shaped interlocking and tessellating pieces.
Each piece usually has a small part of a picture on it; when complete, a jigsaw puzzle produces a complete picture. In some cases more advanced types have appeared on the market, such as spherical jigsaws and puzzles showing [[optical illusions]].

Jigsaw puzzles were originally created by [[painting]] a picture on a flat, rectangular piece of wood, and then cutting that picture into small pieces with a [[jigsaw (tool)|jigsaw]], hence the name. [[John Spilsbury (cartographer)|John Spilsbury]], a [[London]] [[cartographer]] and [[engraver]], is credited with commercializing jigsaw puzzles around 1760.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|last1=McAdam|first1=Daniel|title=History of Jigsaw Puzzles|url=http://www.jigsaw-puzzle.org/jigsaw-puzzle-history.html|publisher=American Jigsaw Puzzle Society |accessdate=13 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001019002453/http://www.jigsaw-puzzle.org/jigsaw-puzzle-history.html|archivedate=19 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jigsaw puzzles have since come to be made primarily of cardboard.

Typical images found on jigsaw puzzles include scenes from [[nature]], [[building]]s, and repetitive designs. [[Castle]]s and [[mountain]]s are two traditional subjects. However, any kind of picture can be used to make a jigsaw puzzle; some companies offer to turn personal photographs into puzzles. Completed puzzles can also be attached to a backing with adhesive to be used as artwork.

During recent years, a range of [[jigsaw puzzle accessories]] including boards, cases, frames and roll-up mats has become available that are designed to assist jigsaw puzzle enthusiasts.

==History==
[[File:Spilsbury jigsaw - John Spilsbury, 1766 - BL.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Spilsbury (cartographer)|John Spilsbury]]'s "Europe divided into its kingdoms, etc." (1766). He created the jigsaw puzzle for educational purposes, and called them “Dissected Maps”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Time of the Jigsaws|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/entries/7f70977c-1c98-318f-9174-1dddfa3565a7|agency=BBC|date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 10 facts about jigsaw puzzles|url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/top10facts/616404/Top-10-facts-jigsaws-puzzles|agency=Daily Express|date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[engraving|engraver]] and [[cartographer]] [[John Spilsbury (cartographer)|John Spilsbury]], of [[London]], is believed to have produced the first jigsaw puzzle around 1760, using a [[marquetry]] saw.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Early jigsaws, known as dissections, were produced by mounting [[map]]s on sheets of [[hardwood]] and cutting along [[border|national boundaries]], creating a puzzle useful for the teaching of [[geography]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Such "dissected maps" were used to teach the children of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]] by royal governess [[Lady Charlotte Finch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrp.org.uk/NewsAndMedia/TheArtFundKewPalacejigsaw_ Historic Royal Palaces press release "Jigsaw cabinet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613212211/http://www.hrp.org.uk/NewsAndMedia/TheArtFundKewPalacejigsaw_ |date=2015-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1243701/puzzle-cabinet-unknown/ V&amp;A collection; Museum number:B.1:1 &amp; 2-2011; puzzle cabinet&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "jigsaw" came to be associated with the puzzle around 1880 when [[fretsaws]] became the tool of choice for cutting the shapes. Since fretsaws are distinct from [[jigsaw (tool)|jigsaws]], the name appears to be a [[misnomer]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt; [[Cardboard]] jigsaw puzzles appeared during the late 1800s, but were slow to replace the wooden jigsaw due to the manufacturer's belief that cardboard puzzles would be perceived as being of low quality, and the fact that [[profit margins]] on wooden jigsaws were larger.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;
[[File:Close up of Hand Cut Jigsaw Puzzle.JPG|thumb|left|Wooden jigsaw pieces, cut by hand]]
Jigsaw puzzles soared in popularity during the [[Great Depression]], as they provided a cheap, long-lasting, [[recycling|recyclable]] form of entertainment.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref name=briefhistory&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Anne, D.|title=Jigsaw Puzzles - A Brief History|url=http://www.mgcpuzzles.com/mgcpuzzles/puzzle%5Fhistory/|website=www.mgcpuzzles.com|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was around this time that jigsaws evolved to become more complex and more appealing to adults.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; They were also given away in [[promotion (marketing)|product promotions]], and used in [[advertising]], with customers completing an image of the product being promoted.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref name=briefhistory /&gt;

Sales of wooden jigsaw puzzles fell after [[World War II]] as improved [[wages]] led to [[price]] increases, while at the same time improvements in [[manufacturing]] processes made cardboard jigsaws more attractive.&lt;ref name=briefhistory /&gt;

According to the [[Alzheimer Society of Canada]], doing jigsaw puzzles is one of many activities that can help keep the brain active and may contribute to reducing the risk of developing [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alzheimer.ca/english/brain/challengeyourself.htm Healthy Brain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212111954/http://alzheimer.ca/english/brain/challengeyourself.htm |date=2010-12-12 }} Alzheimer Society of Canada Accessed 30 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern construction==

[[File:Sky puzzle.jpg|thumb|left|Paperboard jigsaw pieces]]
Most modern jigsaw puzzles are made out of [[paperboard]] since they are easier and cheaper to mass-produce than the original wooden models. An enlarged [[photograph]] or printed reproduction of a painting or other two-dimensional [[art]]work is glued onto the cardboard before cutting. This board is then fed into a press.  The press forces a set of hardened steel blades of the desired shape through the board until it is fully cut.  This procedure is similar to making shaped cookies with a cookie cutter.  The forces involved, however, are tremendously greater and a typical 1000-piece puzzle requires a press that can generate upwards of 700 tons of force to push the knives of the puzzle die through the board. A puzzle die is a flat board, often made from plywood, which has slots cut or burned in the same shape as the knives that are used.  These knives are set into the slots and covered in a compressible material, typically foam rubber, which serves to eject the cut puzzle pieces.

Beginning in the 1930s, jigsaw puzzles were cut using large hydraulic presses which now cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The cuts gave a very snug fit, but the cost limited jigsaw puzzle manufacture only to large corporations.  Recent roller press design achieve the same effect, at a lower cost.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} By the early 1960s, [[Tower Press]] was the world's largest maker of jigsaw puzzles, acquired by [[Waddingtons]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="Achievement"&gt;{{cite book|title=Achievement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMkNAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=3 April 2013|year=1962|publisher=World Trade Magazines Ltd.|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technology has enabled laser-cutting of wooden or acrylic jigsaw puzzles. The advantage of cutting with a laser is that the puzzle can be custom cut into any size, any shape, with any size (or any number) of pieces. Many museums have laser cut acrylic puzzles made of some of their more important pieces of art so that children visiting the museum can see the original piece and then assemble a jigsaw puzzle of the image that is also in the same shape as the piece of art. Acrylic is used because the pieces are very durable, waterproof, and can withstand continued use without the image fading, or the pieces wearing out, or becoming frayed. Also, because the print and cut patterns are computer-based, lost pieces can be manufactured without remaking the entire puzzle.

== Variations ==
[[File:JigsawSoftware.jpeg|thumb|Jigsaw puzzle [[software]] allowing rotation of pieces.]]
[[File:Ignis-spindle-fin12.jpg|thumb|left|A three dimensional puzzle composed of several two dimensional puzzles stacked on top of one another.]]
[[Image:Puzzle Krypt-2.jpg|thumb|A puzzle without a picture]]

Jigsaw puzzles come in a variety of sizes. Smaller puzzles are often considered to be those of 300, 500, and 750 pieces. More sophisticated, but still common, jigsaw puzzles come in sizes of 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,500, 8,000, 9,000, 13,200, 18,000, 24,000, 32,000 and 40,000 pieces.

There are also smaller jigsaw puzzles that are geared towards children, and are rated by the number of pieces they contain. For very young children, a puzzle with as few as 4 to 9 'large' size pieces (so not a choking hazard) are common. These are usually made of wood or plastic, to maintain durability, and are able to be cleaned without being damaged.

The most common layout for a thousand-piece puzzle is 38 pieces by 27 pieces, for a total count of 1,026 pieces. The majority of 500-piece puzzles are 27 pieces by 19 pieces.  A few puzzles are made double-sided, so that they can be solved from either side. This adds a level of complexity, because it cannot be certain that the correct side of the piece is being viewed and assembled with the other pieces.

"Family puzzles" come in 100–550 pieces with three different sized pieces from large to small. The pieces are placed from large to small going in one direction or towards the middle of the puzzle.  This allows a family of puzzlers of different skill levels and different-sized hands to work on the puzzle at the same time.  Companies like [[Springbok Puzzles|Springbok]], [[Cobble Hill Puzzles|Cobble Hill]], [[Ravensburger]], and [[Suns Out]] make this type of specialty puzzle.

There are also [[dimension|three-dimensional]] jigsaw puzzles. Many of these are made of wood or [[styrofoam]] and require the puzzle to be solved in a certain order; some pieces will not fit in if others are already in place.
Also common are ''puzzle boxes:'' simple three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles with a small drawer or box in the center for storage.

Another type of jigsaw puzzle, which is considered a 3-D puzzle, is a [[puzzle globe]].  Like a 2-D puzzle, a globe puzzle is often made of plastic and the assembled pieces form a single layer. But the final form is a three-dimensional shape. Most globe puzzles have designs representing spherical shapes such as the [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], and historical globes of the Earth.

There are also computer versions of jigsaw puzzles, which have the advantages of requiring zero cleanup as well as no risk of losing any pieces. Many computer-based jigsaw puzzles do not allow pieces to be rotated, so all pieces are displayed in their correct orientation. These puzzles are thus considerably easier than a physical jigsaw puzzle with the same number of pieces. A computer puzzle website can allow users to choose their own puzzle size, cut design, and image, or upload their own images to use as puzzles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Jigsaw Puzzles|url=http://www.jigzone.com/|publisher=Jigzone|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online jigsaw version of [[Trolleholm Castle]] in Sweden may be worked and timed for speed of finishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trolleholm Castle, Sweden jigsaw puzzle|url=http://thejigsawpuzzles.com/Castles/Trolleholm-Castle-Sweden-jigsaw-puzzle|website=TheJigsawPuzzles.com|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Yorker Magazine]] subscription website preserves images of the magazine's cover illustrations as jigsaw puzzles which are timed and offer several levels of difficulty.

In 2016 was introduced a computer version of puzzle globe, the [[immersive panorama jigsaw]], which is based on the use of [[equirectangular]] images taken by 360-degree camera. Despite the physical spherical jigsaw, the player, who resides in the perfect center of the globe, assembles triangular shaped interlocking pieces around him. When complete, this puzzle produces a full-degree panorama all around the player. An example of immersive jigsaw is [[Sitespot]], which also enriches the gaming experience with the scene soundscape and allows pieces to be displayed rotated.

Jigsaw puzzles can vary greatly in price depending on the complexity, number of pieces, and brand. Children's puzzles can be as cheap as around $5.00 while larger puzzles can be closer to $50.00. The most expensive puzzle to date was sold for $27,000 in 2005 at a charitable auction for The Golden Retriever Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-expensive-jigsaw-puzzle-sold-at-auction/|title=Most expensive jigsaw puzzle sold at auction|website=Guinness World Records|access-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several word puzzle games use pieces similar to those used in jigsaw puzzles. Examples include [[Alfa-Lek]], [[Jigsaw Words]], [[Nab-It!]], [[Puzzlage]], [[Typ-Dom]], [[Word Jigsaw]], and [[Yottsugo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1028/puzzle|title=Puzzle - Board Game Category - BoardGameGeek|author=|date=|website=boardgamegeek.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Puzzle pieces ==
[[Image:Whimsy.JPG|thumb|A "whimsy" piece in a wooden jigsaw puzzle]]
[[Image:3D Jigsaw Puzzle.jpg|thumb|A 3D jigsaw puzzle]]
Many puzzles are termed "fully interlocking". This means that adjacent pieces are connected in such a way that if one piece is moved horizontally, the other pieces move with it, preserving the connection. Sometimes the connection is tight enough to pick up a solved part by holding one piece.

Some fully interlocking puzzles have pieces all of a similar shape, with rounded tabs out on opposite ends, with corresponding blanks cut into the intervening sides to receive the tabs of adjacent pieces. Other fully interlocking puzzles may have tabs and blanks variously arranged on each piece, but they usually have four sides, and the numbers of tabs and blanks thus add up to four. The uniform-shaped fully interlocking puzzles, sometimes called "Japanese Style", are the most difficult, because the differences in shapes between pieces can be very subtle. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Most jigsaw puzzles are square, rectangular, or round, with edge pieces that have one side that is either straight or smoothly curved to create this shape, plus four corner pieces if the puzzle is square or rectangular. Some jigsaw puzzles have edge pieces that are cut just like all the rest of the interlocking pieces, with no smooth edge, to make them more challenging. Other puzzles are designed so the shape of the whole puzzle forms a figure, such as an animal. The edge pieces may vary more in these cases.&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} --&gt;&lt;!--  No citation is required, as the statement merely follows logically from the preceding one; this is no doubt at least partly responsible for the citation request being ignored for 8 years. --&gt;

The pieces of spherical jigsaw, like immersive panorama jigsaw, can be triangular shaped, according to the rules of tessellation of the geoid primitive.

The world's largest commercially available jigsaw puzzle (Nov. 2018) is produced by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] company [[MartinPuzzle]] and contains 52,110 pieces showing a collage of animals.

In 2016 the German company [[Ravensburger]] released their biggest puzzle. It shows 10 scenes from [[Disney]] works and has 40,320 pieces, measuring 680&amp;nbsp;cm by 192&amp;nbsp;cm when assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/2000/largest-commercial-jigsaw-puzzle-most-pieces |title=Largest commercial jigsaw puzzle - most pieces |publisher=Guinness World Records |date=2010-09-01 |accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural significance ==
[[File:Autismawareness.jpg|thumb|The current most recognized symbol for autism is the "autism awareness" ribbon, which features red, blue, and yellow jigsaw pieces.]]
The logo of [[Wikipedia]] is a globe made out of jigsaw pieces. The incomplete sphere appears to have some pieces missing, symbolizing the room to add new knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In the logo of the [[Colombia|Colombian]] [[Office of the Attorney General of Colombia|Office of the Attorney General]] appears a jigsaw puzzle piece in foreground. They named it as "The Key Piece": "The jigsaw puzzle piece is the appropiate symbol for visual representation of the Office, since it includes the concepts of searching, solution and response that the institution pursuits through its investigation activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fiscalia.gov.co/colombia/la-entidad/el-logo-el-himno/ |title="Logo and anthem of the Office of the Attorney General of Colombia" |publisher=Fiscalía General de la Nación (Colombia) |date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central antagonist in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'']] film franchise is named Jigsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387564/ |title="Saw" IMDB page |publisher=Internet Movie Database |date=2004-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1933 [[Laurel and Hardy]] short ''[[Me and My Pal (1933 film)|Me and My Pal]]'', several characters attempt to complete a large jigsaw puzzle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024316/ |title="Me and My Pal" IMDB page |publisher=Internet Movie Database |date=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbol for autism ===
Jigsaw puzzle pieces were first used as a symbol for [[Autism spectrum|autism]] in 1963 by the United Kingdom's [[National Autistic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autism.org.uk/news-and-events/about-the-nas/who-we-are/timeline/timeline-text-only-version.aspx |title=NAS timeline (text only version) |publisher=National Autistic Society |date=2013-02-15 |access-date=2014-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144250/http://www.autism.org.uk/news-and-events/about-the-nas/who-we-are/timeline/timeline-text-only-version.aspx |archive-date=2014-07-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization chose jigsaw pieces for their logo to represent the "puzzling" nature of autism and the inability to "fit in" due to social differences, and also because jigsaw pieces were recognizable and otherwise unused. Puzzle pieces have since been incorporated into the logos and promotional materials of many organizations, including the [[Autism Society of America]] and [[Autism Speaks]].

Proponents of the [[autism rights movement]] oppose the jigsaw puzzle iconography, stating that metaphors such as "puzzling" and "incomplete" are harmful to autistic people. Critics of the puzzle piece symbol instead advocate for a rainbow-colored [[infinity]] symbol representing diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unpuzzled.net/2012/05/02/i-am-not-a-puzzle-from-reports-from-a-resident-alien/|title=I am not a puzzle: From Reports from a Resident Alien|author=Lisa D.

In February 2018, the journal removed the puzzle piece from their cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diament|first1=Michelle|title=Autism Journal Abandons Puzzle Piece|url=https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2018/02/02/autism-journal-abandons-puzzle/24668/|accessdate=March 18, 2018|work=Disability Scoop|date=February 2, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further examples of mesic habitats include all of the earth. These habitats effectively provide drought insurance as land at higher elevations warms due to seasonal or other change.

Healthy mesic habitats act like sponges in that they store water in such a way that it can be deposited to neighboring habitats as needed. They are common in dryer regions of the western United States, and can be a good water source to neighboring desert habitats. Healthy mesic habitats also provide forb and insects for organisms belonging to higher trophic levels, such as grouse. 

Mesic habitats are under stress from various human activities such as ranching, however many conservation efforts are underway. As of 2010, over 1,474 ranchers have agreed to partner with the Sage Grouse Initiative under the U.S. Department of Agriculture in order to protect over 5.6 million acres of mesic habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sagegrouseinitiative.com/water-is-life/|title=Water Is Life: Introducing SGI's Mesic Habitat Conservation Strategy - Sage Grouse Initiative|date=2017-04-05|work=Sage Grouse Initiative|access-date=2017-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''microplane model''', conceived in 1984,&lt;ref name="Baz84"/&gt; is a [[materials science|material]] [[constitutive model]] for progressive softening damage. Its advantage over the classical tensorial constitutive models is that it can capture the oriented nature of damage such as tensile [[Fracture|cracking]], slip, [[friction]], and compression splitting, as well as the orientation of fiber reinforcement. Another advantage is that the [[anisotropy]] of materials such as gas shale or fiber composites can be effectively represented. To prevent unstable strain localization (and spurious mesh sensitivity in finite element computations), this model must be used in combination with some nonlocal continuum formulation (e.g., the crack band model). Prior to 2000, these advantages were outweighed by greater computational demands of the material subroutine, but thanks to huge increase of computer power, the microplane model is now routinely used in computer programs, even with tens of millions of [[finite elements]].

==Method and motivation==
The basic idea of the microplane model is to express the constitutive law not in terms of [[tensor]]s, but in terms of the [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]]s of [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] and [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]] acting on planes of various orientations called the microplanes. The use of vectors was inspired by [[G. I. Taylor]]'s idea in 1938 &lt;ref name="Tay38"/&gt; which led to Taylor models for plasticity of polycrystalline metals.&lt;ref name="BatBud49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BudWu62"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ric71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HilRic72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ButMcD98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BroBaz00"/&gt; But the microplane models &lt;ref name="Baz84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BroBaz00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BazOh85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BazPra88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CarBaz97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BazCan-00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CanBaz13"/&gt; differ conceptually in two ways.

Firstly, to prevent model instability in [[Concrete fracture analysis|post-peak softening damage]], the kinematic constraint must be used instead of the static one. Thus, the strain (rather than stress) vector on each microplane is the projection of the macroscopic [[strain tensor]], i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \varepsilon_N = \varepsilon_{ij}N_{ij} ~~ \varepsilon_M = \varepsilon_{ij}M_{ij} ~~ \varepsilon_L = \varepsilon_{ij}L_{ij}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_N, \varepsilon_M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_L&lt;/math&gt; are the [[normal vector]] and two strain vectors corresponding to each microplane, and &lt;math&gt;N_{ij} = n_i n_j, M_{ij} = (n_i m_j + m_i n_j)/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_{ij} = (n_i \ell_j + \ell_i n_j)/2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n_i, m_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell_i&lt;/math&gt; are three mutually [[orthogonal vectors]], one normal and two tangential, characterizing each particular microplane (subscripts &lt;math&gt;i,j=1,2,3&lt;/math&gt; refer to Cartesian coordinates).

Secondly, a [[variational principle]] (or the principle of [[virtual work]]) relates the stress vector components on the microplanes (&lt;math&gt;\sigma_N, \sigma_M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_L&lt;/math&gt;) to the macro-continuum [[Cauchy stress tensor#Stress deviator tensor|stress tensor]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, to ensure equilibrium. This yields for the stress tensor the expression:&lt;ref name="BazOh85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CanBaz13"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sigma_{ij} = \frac{3}{2 \pi} \int_\Omega s_{ij}\, d\Omega
    \approx 6 \sum_{\mu=1}^{N_m} w_\mu s_{ij}^{(\mu)}
&lt;/math&gt;

with

: &lt;math&gt; s_{ij} = \sigma_N N_{ij} + \sigma_L L_{ij} + \sigma_M M_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the surface of a unit hemisphere, and the sum is an approximation of the [[integral]]. The weights, &lt;math&gt;w_\mu (\mu = 1, 2,\ldots,n_M)&lt;/math&gt;, are based on an optimal Gaussian integration formula for a spherical surface.&lt;ref name="BazOh85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Str71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BazOh86"/&gt; At least 21 microplanes are needed for acceptable accuracy but 37 are distinctly more accurate.

The inelastic or damage behavior is characterized by subjecting the microplane stresses &lt;math&gt;\sigma_N, \sigma_M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_L&lt;/math&gt; to strain-dependent strength limits called stress-strain boundaries imposed on each microplane. They are of four types,&lt;ref name="CanBaz13"/&gt; viz.:
# The tensile normal boundary – to capture progressive tensile fracturing;
# The compressive volumetric boundary – to capture phenomenon such as pore collapse under extreme pressures;
# The shear boundary – to capture friction; and
# The compressive deviatoric boundary – to capture softening in compression, using the volumetric stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_V = \sigma_{kk}/3&lt;/math&gt; and deviatoric stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_D = \sigma_N - \sigma_V&lt;/math&gt; on the microplanes.
Each step of explicit analysis begins with an elastic predictor and, if the boundary has been exceeded, the stress vector component on the microplane is then dropped at constant strain to the boundary.

==Applications==
The microplane constitutive model for damage in concrete evolved since 1984 through a series of progressively improved models labeled M0, M1, M2, ..., M7.&lt;ref name="CanBaz13"/&gt; It was also extended to [[fiber composite]]s (woven or braided laminates), [[rock (geology)|rock]], jointed rock mass, [[clay]], [[sand]], foam and [[metal]].&lt;ref name="BroBaz00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CarBaz97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CheBaz14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CheBaz14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CofKoh94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CanBaz-11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KirSuBaz15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KirSalBaz15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KozOzb10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OzbLi-01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PraSan-97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TraOzb-09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adl12"/&gt; The microplane model has been shown to allow close fits of the concrete test data for [[uniaxial]], [[biaxial]] and [[Ellipsoid|triaxial]] loadings with post-peak softening, compression-tension load cycles, opening and mixed mode fractures, tension-shear and compression-shear failures, axial compression followed by torsion (i.e., the vertex effect) and fatigue. The loading rate effect and long-term aging creep of concrete have also been incorporated. Models M4 and M7 have been generalized to finite strain. The microplane model has been introduced into various commercial programs (ATENA, OOFEM, DIANA, SBETA,...) and large proprietary wavecodes (EPIC, PRONTO, MARS,...). Alternatively, it is often being used as the user's subroutine such as UMAT or VUMAT in ABAQUS.

'''''Night of the Grizzlies''''' (1969) is a book by [[Jack Olsen]] which details events surrounding the night of August 13, 1967,&lt;ref&gt;Sarasota Herald Tribune, Nov 23 1969, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DbkqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CmYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=night%20of%20the%20grizzlies%20jack%20olsen&amp;pg=4852%2C2435207 ''Capsule Book Reviews'']&lt;/ref&gt; when two young women were separately attacked in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]], [[Montana]], by [[grizzly bear]]s. Both women, Julie Helgeson, 19, of [[Albert Lea, Minnesota|Albert Lea]], [[Minnesota]], and Michele Koons, 19, of [[San Diego]], [[California]], died of their injuries.&lt;ref&gt;The Windsor Star, Aug 14, 1967, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XzY_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m1EMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=michelle%20koons&amp;pg=4138%2C6134028 ''Grizzlies turn killer – two girls die, youth mauled'']&lt;/ref&gt; Olsen's book examines the most plausible explanation of the unlikely dual attacks&lt;ref&gt;Kaniut, Larry (2001) ''Bear Tales for the Ages: From Alaska and Beyond'' Self Published. {{ISBN|0-9709537-0-4}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=OorM3SUcEFMC&amp;lpg=PA252&amp;dq=night%20of%20the%20grizzlies%20jack%20olsen&amp;pg=PA252#v=onepage&amp;q=night%20of%20the%20grizzlies%20jack%20olsen&amp;f=false p.252.]&lt;/ref&gt; since no fatal grizzly attack had ever been recorded in the park's 57-year history prior to that night.&lt;ref&gt;Turbak, Gary (1997) ''World life library: Grizzly Bears'' Voyageur Press. {{ISBN|0-89658-334-1}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ga1YN24rf-AC&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=night%20of%20the%20grizzlies%20jack%20olsen&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q=night%20of%20the%20grizzlies%20jack%20olsen&amp;f=false p.46.]&lt;/ref&gt; One specialist at the time calculated the odds were greater than 1 in a million for a single attack but the odds of two separate attacks in a 4 hour time span were beyond measure. However future events would show grizzly attacks to become more common, as Olson explains, because of increased human presence in wilderness areas and decreased habitat for bears to live in, reaching a critical tipping point in the summer of 1967.

The text was originally published in 1969 as a three-part article for ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. A 37 page prologue was added for the book.

[[Image:Making a Nova.jpg|frame|right|Artist's conception of a white dwarf, right, [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreting]] hydrogen from the [[Roche lobe]] of its larger companion star]]

A '''nova''' (plural '''[[wiktionary:nova|novae]]''' or '''novas''') or '''classical nova''' ('''CN''', plural '''CNe''') is a [[transient astronomical event]] that causes the sudden appearance of a bright, apparently "new" star, that slowly fades over several weeks or many months. Novae involve an interaction between two stars that cause the flareup that is perceived as a new entity that is much brighter than the stars involved.

Causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova vary, depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars.  All observed novae involve closely located [[binary stars]] (the progenitors), either a pair of [[red dwarf]]s in the process of merging, or a [[white dwarf]] and another star.

The main sub-classes of novae are classical novae, [[recurrent nova]]e (RNe), and [[dwarf nova]]e.  They are all considered to be [[cataclysmic variable star]]s.  [[Luminous red nova]]e share the name and are also cataclysmic variables, but are a different type of event caused by a stellar merger.  Also with similar names are the much more energetic [[supernova]]e (SNe) and [[kilonova]]e.

Classical nova eruptions are the most common type of nova. They are likely created in a close binary star system consisting of a white dwarf and either a main sequence, sub-giant, or red giant star. When the orbital period falls in the range of several days to one day, the white dwarf is close enough to its companion star to start drawing [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreted]] matter onto the surface of the white dwarf, which creates a dense but shallow atmosphere. This atmosphere is mostly [[hydrogen]] and is thermally heated by the hot white dwarf, which eventually reaches a critical temperature causing rapid runaway ignition by [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].

From the dramatic and sudden energies created, the now hydrogen-burnt atmosphere is then dramatically expelled into interstellar space, and its brightened envelope is seen as the visible light created from the nova event, and previously was mistaken as a "new" star. A few novae produce short-lived [[nova remnant]]s,&lt;ref name="Liimets2014"&gt;{{Cite journal

Novae most often occur in the sky along the path of the Milky Way, especially near the observed [[galactic centre]] in Sagittarius; however, they can appear anywhere in the sky. They occur far more [[List of novae in the Milky Way galaxy|frequently]] than galactic supernovae, averaging about ten per year. Most are found telescopically, perhaps only one every year to eighteen months reaching naked-eye visibility. Novae reaching first or second [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] occur only several times per century. The last bright nova was [[V1369 Centauri]] reaching 3.3 magnitude on 14 December 2013.

== Etymology ==
During the sixteenth century, astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] observed the [[supernova]] [[SN 1572]] in the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]. He described it in his book ''De nova stella'' ([[Latin]] for "concerning the new star"), giving rise to the adoption of the name ''nova''. In this work he argued that a nearby object should be seen to move relative to the fixed stars, and that the nova had to be very far away. Although this event was a supernova and not a nova, the terms were considered interchangeable until the 1930s.&lt;ref name="encyc" /&gt; After this, novae were classified as ''classical novae'' to distinguish them from supernovae, as their causes and energies were thought to be different, based solely in the observational evidence.

Ironically, despite the term "stellar nova" meaning "new star", novae most often take place as a result of [[white dwarf]]s: remnants of extremely ''old'' stars.

== Stellar evolution of novae  ==
Evolution of potential novae begins with two main sequence stars in a binary system. One of the two evolves into a [[red giant]], leaving its remnant white dwarf core in orbit with the remaining star. The second star—which may be either a main sequence star or an aging giant—begins to shed its envelope onto its white dwarf companion when it overflows its [[Roche lobe]]. As a result, the white dwarf steadily captures matter from the companion's outer atmosphere in an accretion disk, and in turn, the accreted matter falls into the atmosphere. As the white dwarf consists of [[degenerate matter]], the accreted hydrogen does not inflate, but its temperature increases. Runaway fusion occurs when the temperature of this atmospheric layer reaches ~20&amp;nbsp;million [[Kelvin|K]], initiating nuclear burning, via the [[CNO cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= On the Progenitors of Galactic Novae |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |date= 10 February 2012 |volume= 746 |issue= 61 |url= http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/746/1/61/article |accessdate= 10 February 2015 |author= M.J.

[[File:GKPersei-MiniSuperNova-20150316.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[GK Persei]]: Nova of 1901]]
Hydrogen fusion may occur in a stable manner on the surface of the white dwarf for a narrow range of accretion rates, giving rise to a [[super soft X-ray source]], but for most binary system parameters, the hydrogen burning is unstable thermally and rapidly converts a large amount of the hydrogen into other, heavier [[chemical element]]s in a [[thermal runaway|runaway]] reaction,&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; liberating an enormous amount of energy. This blows the remaining gases away from the surface of the white dwarf surface and produces an extremely bright outburst of light.

The rise to peak brightness may be very rapid, or gradual. This is related to the speed class of the nova; yet after the peak, the brightness declines steadily.&lt;ref&gt;[[AAVSO]] Variable Star Of The Month: [http://www.aavso.org/vstar/vsots/0501.shtml May 2001: Novae]&lt;/ref&gt; The time taken for a nova to decay by around 2 or 3&amp;nbsp;magnitudes from maximum optical brightness is used for classification, via its speed class. Fast novae typically will take fewer than 25&amp;nbsp;days to decay by 2&amp;nbsp;magnitudes, while slow novae will take more than 80&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of their violence, usually the amount of material ejected in novae is only about {{frac|10,000}} of a [[solar mass]], quite small relative to the mass of the white dwarf. Furthermore, only five percent of the accreted mass is fused during the power outburst.&lt;ref name="encyc" /&gt; Nonetheless, this is enough energy to accelerate nova ejecta to velocities as high as several thousand kilometers per second—higher for fast novae than slow ones—with a concurrent rise in [[luminosity]] from a few times solar to 50,000–100,000&amp;nbsp;times solar.&lt;ref name="encyc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Potentially, a white dwarf can generate multiple novae over time as additional hydrogen continues to accrete onto its surface from its companion star. An example is [[RS Ophiuchi]], which is known to have flared six times (in 1898, 1933, 1958, 1967, 1985, and 2006). Eventually, the white dwarf could explode as a Type&amp;nbsp;[[Ia supernova]] if it approaches the [[Chandrasekhar limit]].

Occasionally, novae are bright enough and close enough to Earth to be conspicuous to the unaided eye. The brightest recent example was [[V1500 Cygni|Nova Cygni 1975]]. This nova appeared on 29&amp;nbsp;August 1975, in the constellation [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] about five degrees north of [[Deneb]], and reached [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]]&amp;nbsp;2.0 (nearly as bright as [[Deneb]]). The most recent were [[V1280 Scorpii]], which reached magnitude&amp;nbsp;3.7 on 17&amp;nbsp;February 2007, and [[Nova Delphini 2013]]. [[Nova Centauri 2013]] was discovered 2&amp;nbsp;December 2013 and so far, is the brightest nova of this millennium, reaching magnitude&amp;nbsp;3.3.

=== Helium novae ===
A helium nova (undergoing a helium flash) is a proposed category of nova events that lacks hydrogen lines in its spectrum. This may be caused by the explosion of a helium shell on a white dwarf. The theory was first proposed in 1989, and the first candidate helium nova to be observed was [[V445 Puppis]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Occurrence rate and astrophysical significance ==

Astronomers estimate that the [[Milky Way]] experiences roughly 30 to 60 novae per year, but a recent examination has found the likely improved rate of about 50±27.&lt;ref name="Shafter2017"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] observation of nova ejecta [[nebulae]] has shown that they are enriched in elements such as helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, and magnesium.&lt;ref name="encyc" /&gt; The contribution of novae to the [[interstellar medium]] is not great; novae supply only {{frac|50}} as much material to the Galaxy as do supernovae, and only {{frac|200}} as much as [[red giant]] and [[supergiant]] stars.&lt;ref name="encyc" /&gt;

Recurrent novae such as [[RS Ophiuchi]] (those with periods on the order of decades), are rare. Astronomers theorize, however, that most, if not all, novae are recurrent, albeit on time scales ranging from 1,000 to 100,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recurrence interval for a nova is less dependent on the accretion rate of the white dwarf, than on its mass; with their powerful gravity, massive white dwarfs require less accretion to fuel an outburst than lower-mass ones.&lt;ref name="encyc" /&gt; Consequently, the interval is shorter for high-mass white dwarfs.&lt;ref name="encyc" /&gt;

Novae have some promise for use as [[standard candle]] measurements of distances. For instance, the distribution of their [[absolute magnitude]] is [[bimodal distribution|bimodal]], with a main peak at magnitude −8.8, and a lesser one at −7.5. Novae also have roughly the same absolute magnitude 15 days after their peak (−5.5). Comparisons of nova-based distance estimates to various nearby [[Galaxy|galaxies]] and [[galaxy cluster]]s with those measured with [[Cepheid]] [[variable star]]s, have shown them to be of comparable accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Omega-7 fatty acids''' are a class of [[unsaturated fatty acids]] in which the site of unsaturation is seven carbon atoms from the end of the carbon chain.  The two most common omega-7 fatty acids in nature are [[palmitoleic acid]] and [[vaccenic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Formation of (n-9) and (n-7) cis-monounsaturated fatty acids in seeds of higher plants |author1=Mukherjee, Kumar D. |author2=Kiewitt, Irmgard | journal = Planta | year = 1980 | volume = 149 | issue = 5 | pages = 461–463 | doi = 10.1007/BF00385748 | pmid=24306473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rich sources include [[macadamia nut oil]] and [[sea buckthorn oil]] in the form of palmitoleic acid, while [[dairy products]] are the primary sources of vaccenic acid and [[rumenic acid]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} A lesser but useful source of palmitoleic acid is [[avocado]] fruit (25,000ppm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of phytochemical constituents of GRAS herbs and other economic plants.|last = Duke|first = James A.|publisher = CRC Press|year = 1992|isbn = |location = Boca Raton, Florida.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''outage management system''' (OMS) is a computer system used by operators of [[electric distribution systems]] to assist in restoration of power.

== Major functions of an OMS ==
Major functions usually found in an OMS include:
* Prediction of location of transformer, fuse, recloser or breaker that opened upon failure.
* Prioritizing restoration efforts and managing resources based upon criteria such as locations of emergency facilities, size of outages, and duration of outages.
* Providing information on extent of outages and number of customers impacted to management, media and regulators.
* Calculation of estimation of restoration times.
* Management of crews assisting in restoration.
* Calculation of crews required for restoration.

== OMS principles and integration requirements ==
At the core of a modern outage management system is a detailed network model of the distribution system. The utility's [[geographic information system]] (GIS) is usually the source of this network model. By combining the locations of outage calls from customers, a rules engine is used to predict the locations of outages. For instance, since the distribution system is primarily tree-like or radial in design, all calls in particular area downstream of a fuse could be inferred to be caused by a single fuse or circuit breaker upstream of the calls.

The outage calls are usually taken by call takers in a call center utilizing a customer information system (CIS). Another common way for outage calls to enter into the CIS (and thus the OMS) is by integration with an [[interactive voice response]] (IVR) system. The CIS is also the source for all the customer records which are linked to the network model. Customers are typically linked to the [[transformer]] serving their residence or business. It is important that every customer be linked to a device in the model so that accurate statistics are derived on each outage. Customers not linked to a device in the model are referred to as "fuzzies".

More advanced [[automatic meter reading]] (AMR) systems can provide outage detection and restoration capability and thus serve as virtual calls indicating customers who are without power. However, unique characteristics of AMR systems such as the additional system loading and the potential for false positives requires that additional rules and filter logic must be added to the OMS to support this integration.{{Harv | Sridharan | Schulz | 2001}}

Outage management systems are also commonly integrated with [[SCADA]] systems which can automatically report the operation of monitored circuit breakers and other intelligent devices such as SCADA reclosers.

Another system that is commonly integrated with an outage management system is a [[mobile data system]]. This integration provides the ability for outage predictions to automatically be sent to crews in the field and for the crews to be able to update the OMS with information such as estimated restoration times without requiring radio communication with the control center.  Crews also transmit details about what they did during outage restoration.

It is important that the outage management system electrical model be kept up to current so that it can accurately make outage predictions and also accurately keep track of which customers are out and which are restored. By using this model and by tracking which switches, breakers and fuses are open and which are closed, network tracing functions can be used to identify every customer who is out, when they were first out and when they were restored. Tracking this information is the key to accurately reporting outage statistics. [http://www.pochenchen.com/uploads/3/3/7/6/3376872/2014_cired_final.pdf (P.-C. Chen, et al., 2014)]

== OMS benefits ==
OMS benefits include:
* Reduced outage durations due to faster restoration based upon outage location predictions.
* Reduced outage duration averages due to prioritizing
* Improved customer satisfaction due to increase awareness of outage restoration progress and providing estimated restoration times.
* Improved media relations by providing accurate outage and restoration information.
* Fewer complaints to regulators due to ability to prioritize restoration of emergency facilities and other critical customers.
* Reduced outage frequency due to use of outage statistics for making targeted reliability improvements.

== OMS based distribution reliability improvements ==
An OMS supports distribution system planning activities related to improving reliability by providing important outage statistics. In this role, an OMS provides the data needed for the calculation of measurements of the system reliability. Reliability is commonly measured by performance indices defined by the IEEE P1366-2003 standard. The most frequently used performance indices are [[SAIDI]], [[CAIDI]], [[SAIFI]] and [[MAIFI]].

An OMS also support the improvement of distribution reliability by providing historical data that can be mined to find common causes, failures and damages. By understanding the most common modes of failure, improvement programs can be prioritized with those that provide the largest improvement on reliability for the lowest cost.

While deploying an OMS improves the accuracy of the measured reliability indices, it often results an apparent degradation of reliability due to improvements over manual methods that almost always underestimate the frequency of outages, the size of outage and the duration of outages. To compare reliability in years before an OMS deployment to the years after requires adjustments to be made to the pre-deployment years measurements to be meaningful.

'''Peugeot Velv''' (Véhicule électrique Léger de Ville) is a concept lightweight urban [[electric vehicle]] presented in [[Paris]] on 26 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://betterparts.org/peugeot/peugeot-velv.html|title=Peugeot Velv|work=betterparts.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Velv's very short [[Axle#Drive_axle|rear axle]] makes it closer to being a [[Three-wheeler]].  It is a three-seater with overall length of 2.81 m.
The electric motor generates output of 32&amp;nbsp;hp (20&amp;nbsp;kW), for a top speed of 110&amp;nbsp;km/h.  Cruising range is 100 kilometers with 8.5 kWh battery capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psa-peugeot-citroen.com/en/automotive-innovation/innovation-by-psa/velv-lightweight-urban-electric-vehicle|title=VELV, electric car engine : a lightweight urban electric vehicle|work=PSA PEUGEOT CITROËN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/elektro-prototyp-velv-dreisitziges-stadtmobil-von-peugeot-citroen-a-902994.html|title=Elektro-Prototyp VELV: Dreisitziges Stadtmobil von Peugeot-Citroën|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=11 June 2013|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/peugeot-citroen-reveals-its-futuristic-velv-concept-car/rsz-psa-peugeot-citroen-velv-concept-3/|title=Peugeot Citroen Reveals Its Futuristic VELV Concept Car|work=inhabitat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motor1.com/news/36274/peugeot-introduces-an-updated-velv-concept-video/|title=Peugeot introduces an updated VeLV concept [video]|work=Motor1.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7848">Short chain '''ω-phenylalkanoic acids''' have long been known to occur in natural products. [[Phenylacetic acid|Phenylacetic]], [[Phenylpropanoic acid|3-phenylpropanoic]] and 3-phenylpropenoic ([[cinnamic acid|cinnamic]]) acids are found in [[propolis]], mammalian exocrine secretions or plant fragrances.
During a systematic study of the lipids from seeds of the plant [[Araceae]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid | first1 = PC | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1997 | title = 13-Phenyltridecanoic acid in seed lipids of some aroids| url = | journal = Phytochemistry | volume = 45 | issue = | page = 1173 | doi=10.1016/s0031-9422(97)00111-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the presence of 13-phenyltridecanoic acid as a major component (5-16% of total fatty acids)was discovered. Other similar compounds but with 11 and 15 carbon chain lengths and saturated or unsaturated were shown to be also present but in lower amounts. At the same time, the even carbon chain ω-phenylalkanoic acids of C10 up to C16 were discovered in [[halophilic bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Caballeira | first1 = NM | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1997 | title =  The fatty acid composition of a Vibrio alginolyticus associated with the alga Cladophora coelothrix. Identification of the novel 9-methyl-10-hexadecenoic acid| doi = 10.1007/s11745-006-0163-4 | journal = Lipids | volume = 32 | issue = | page = 1271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ω-phenylalkanoic acid (x = 1 to 17)==

Later, an exhaustive study of 17 genus of the subfamily [[Aroideae]] of Araceae revealed the presence of three major acids, 11-phenylundecanoic acid, 13-phenyltridecanoic acid and 15-phenylpentadecanoic acid in seed lipids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meija | first1 = J | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2004 | title =  Phenyl-terminated fatty acids in seeds of various aroids| url = | journal = Phytochemistry | volume = 65 | issue = | page = 2229 | doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2004.06.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other odd carbon number acids from C7 to C23 were detected but in trace amounts. Similarly, two series of homologous odd carbon number monounsaturated ω-phenylalkanoic acids were found. 
Thus, it can be stated that all odd carbon chain ω-phenylalkanoic acids from C1 through C23 have been found in nature. Furthermore, even carbon chain ω-phenylalkanoic acids from C10 through C16 were also detected.

Substituted phenylalkenoic acids are periodically encountered in nature. As an example, [[rubrenoic acid]]s were purified from [[Alteromonas rubra]], compounds which showed bronchodilatatoric properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holland | first1 = GS | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = | title = none | url = | journal = Chem Ind | volume = 1984 | issue = | page = 850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Methyl phenylalkenoic acids (5 carbon chain) have been described from a terrestrial [[Streptomycete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mukku | first1 = VJ | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2002 | title = 5-(2-Methylphenyl)-4-pentenoic Acid from a Terrestrial Streptomycete | url = http://znaturforsch.com/ab/v57b/s57b0335.pdf | journal = Z Naturforsch | volume = 57b | issue = | page = 335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Serpentene]], a similar polyunsaturated phenylalkenoic acid, is also produced by Streptomyces and was shown to have some antibacterial properties.
 
Several serpentene-like compounds have also been isolated from the same bacterial source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wenzel | first1 = SC | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2004 | title = Novel Polyene Carboxylic Acids fromStreptomyces†| url = | journal = J Nat Prod | volume = 67 | issue = | page = 1631 | doi=10.1021/np049852t}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several bicyclic derivatives of linolenic acid were shown to be generated by alkali isomerization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matikainen | first1 = J | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2003 | title = A study of 1,5-hydrogen shift and cyclization reactions of an alkali isomerized methyl linolenoate| doi = 10.1016/s0040-4020(02)01513-2 | journal = Tetrahedron Lett | volume = 59 | issue = | page = 567 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stink from the [[stinkpot turtle]] (Sternotherus odoratus) contains at least four different foul smelling ω-phenylalkanoic acids, including [[phenylacetic acid]], [[3-phenylpropionic acid]], 5-phenylpentanoic acid, and 7-phenylheptanoic acid.&lt;ref name=eisner77&gt;{{cite journal|last1=EISNER|first1=T.|last2=CONNER|first2=W.

==Bicyclic hexahydroindenoic acid==

Some others (alkyl-phenyl)-alkanoic acids) are formed when linolenic acid is warmed at 260–270&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hase | first1 = A | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1978 | title =  Identification of minor cyclic fatty acids in fractionated tall oil| doi = 10.1007/bf02911902 | journal = JAOCS | volume = 55 | issue = | page = 407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Several forms with 16, 18 and 20 carbon atoms were identified in archaeological pottery vessels and were presumed to have been generated during heating triunsaturated [[fatty acids]].

[[File:Shume3.jpg|thumb|250px|Cable Yarding System in [[Lushoto]], [[Tanzania]] ]]
'''Skyline logging''' (or '''skyline yarding''' or '''[[cable logging]]''') are terms in [[forestry]], in which harvested logs are transported on a suspended steel cable, a [[cableway]] or "highline", from various locations where the trees are felled to a central location, typically next to a road for logistical reasons.  The skyline's cable loop runs around a drive pulley, generally at the central delivery end, and the return pulley at the collection end; the collection-end pulley may be moved radially to other locations within the constraints of the system, and may operate over large areas.

Individual logs are attached to the suspended cable by means of choker cables and carriages. A skyline yarder can pull in 5 to 10 logs at a time, using separate chokers. The pulleys are mounted on towers or cranes, other trees, ridges or, in rare cases, helium balloons.

'''Stevens Vehicles Ltd''' is a British [[electric car]] and van manufacturer based in [[Port Talbot]].

==Background==

The Company is a manufacturer of [[zero emission]] electric cars and vans designed by the father and son team of Tony Stevens and Peter Stevens.&lt;ref name="DT"&gt;The Daily Telegraph, Motoring section, 1 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicles were conceived, designed and developed in [[Kent]], England and are manufactured at Port Talbot, [[Wales]].&lt;ref name="WOL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business-in-wales/business-news/2008/07/16/zero-emission-vans-made-in-wales-91466-21347864/ |title=Zero emission vans made in Wales |website=WalesOnline |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brand, comprising two vehicle types, was launched on 1 March 2008, comprising the ZeCar and ZeVan.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt; The designer is Professor Tony Stevens, who has spent over 50 years in the motor industry and who has long experience in the engineering, design and marketing of vehicles.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt; Tony Stevens designed the [[Hillman Hunter]] and [[Sunbeam Rapier]]. Peter Stevens is an international banker, involved in the financial and sales side of the business.&lt;ref name="WOL2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/03/05/welsh-car-could-be-the-future-of-motoring-91466-20558312/ |title=Welsh car could be the future of motoring |website=WalesOnline |date=5 March 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the vehicles has been described as being "deliciously weird....a bit dippy, yet great fun and strangely stylish."&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt; The strong visual statement derives from their distinctive height, which results from the higher than normal driving position. This is based on the belief, of Tony Stevens, that the driver should be positioned as if sitting at a table.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt; This position gives the driver good access and visibility, but the design also provides plenty of headroom.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt; Both types of vehicle are designed to maximise internal space relative to external dimensions so that, although they are shorter and narrower than most compact vehicles they are also taller, thus creating the equivalent space of a much larger vehicle.&lt;ref name="WOL" /&gt;

The Ze in Zecar and ZeVan stands for zero environmental emissions. On-road [[carbon dioxide]] emissions are zero. However, the [[Lead–acid battery|lead-acid batteries]] require recharging which may produce carbon dioxide, depending on the energy supply source.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt;
Stevens Vehicles is being supported by the [[Welsh Assembly Government]]'s Accelerate Clusters programme which plans to strengthen the automobile sector in Wales by developing emerging technologies and identifying and exploiting niche markets.&lt;ref name="WOL" /&gt; The factory is based at the ECM2 business site within the [[Port Talbot Steelworks]].&lt;ref name="WOL2" /&gt;

The Stevens Vehicles website currently indicates that they are no longer producing vehicles having failed to secure further adequate finance.

==ZeCar==

{{Infobox automobile
| name         = ZeCar
| image        = 
| manufacturer = Stevens Vehicles Ltd.
| production   = current
| engine       = twin AC induction brushless and maintenance free electric
| wheelbase    = 
| width        = 1.50m
| length       = 3.00m
| height       = 1.75m
| body_style   = 5-door hatchback
| top speed   = 56 mph
| running cost   = 2p per mile
| designer     = Professor Tony Stevens
}}

The ZeCar is a 5-door [[hatchback]] with a twin AC induction brushless and maintenance free [[electric engine]], giving the car 140&amp;nbsp;lb ft of [[torque]]. There is a maintenance-free toothed belt drive to the rear wheels. [[Battery (electricity)|Battery]] charging comprises an on-board automatic charging system, with maintenance-free sealed lead-acid gel batteries.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt;

The maximum speed of the ZeCar is 56&amp;nbsp;mph, and with standard batteries the maximum range is 56 miles, unless back-up battery solutions are used. Acceleration is 0–40&amp;nbsp;mph in 15 seconds. The running cost is calculated at 1.2p per mile and the car is not subject to road tax, or congestion charges and parking is free or discounted in some cities such as London.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt;

In 2008, this was the only five-seat electric car on sale in Britain.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt;
{{clear}}

==ZeVan==

{{Infobox automobile
| name         = ZeVan
| image        = 
| manufacturer = Stevens Vehicles Ltd.
| production   = current
| engine       = twin AC induction brushless and maintenance free electric
| range    = up to 100 miles
| payload    = up to 450 kg
| width        = 1.50m 
| length       = 3.00m
| height       = 1.75m
| body_style   = 2-door van
| top speed   = 56 mph
| running cost   = 2p per mile
| designer     = Professor Tony Stevens
}}

The ZeVan is based on the same design as the ZeCar. Access to the rear is by twin-split doors which open out fully and the near-cube design allows optimum space utilisation. The load volume is one Cheps pallet or a Euro pallet and the payload is 450&amp;nbsp;kg. The dimensions of the load area are 1.80 cubic metres. The estimated battery life is 700 cycles at 80% depth of discharge and the design life is 12 years. The cost per mile is estimated at between 1p and 1.2p depending on the electricity tariff rate.&lt;ref name="CM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/17th-july-2008/38/with-electric-vehicles-fast-turning-into-a-very-pr |work=Commercial Motor |title=Electric Vehicles Group Test |date=17 July 2008 |p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the van is electric it does not need servicing and at the end of the battery life Stevens Vehicles would plan to collect the old battery, replace it with a new one, and recycle the old battery. The van is constructed on the principle that it can be recharged on a three-pin plug, thus avoiding the need for supporting infrastructure, although rapid chargers can be purchased allowing a recharge time of 30 minutes. The range is 55 miles for the van and driver, reducing to 38 miles for a fully laden van. Additional batteries can be fitted to increase the range by 50%, but with a corresponding reduction in payload of 125&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt; 
{{clear}}

==Plans==

The project plan is to develop several variations on the "Ze" theme. Plans include variants on the Ze range, including a pick-up truck and [[Taxicab|taxi]], together with a contemporary version of the Cipher, a concept car first shown at the 1980 motor show and which could go on sale with an electric engine with a range capability of 70 miles and a 70&amp;nbsp;mph top speed.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt;

New battery technologies are under development, including non-hydrogen fuel cells and bio-diesel hybrids.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt;

The global plan is to establish small Ze plants in rural areas across the developing world. The production line and other tools and materials would be delivered by a single lorry and full-scale production could begin rapidly with output flexible enough to meet the cycle of local supply. Tony Stevens refers to this concept as Global Village Transport.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt;

==History==
The company was established in 1889 as the Ya. M. Aivaz ({{lang-ru|Я. М. Айваз}}) Factory.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=История|url=http://www.svetlanajsc.ru/ru/about/history|website=ПАО «Светлана»|accessdate=15 October 2017|language=ru-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Svetlana was a major producer of [[vacuum tube]]s. In 1937, the Soviet Union purchased a tube assembly line from [[RCA]], including production licenses and initial staff training, and installed it on the St Petersburg plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jogis-roehrenbude.de/Roehren-Geschichtliches/Geschichte_Russischer_Roehren/Geschichte_Russischer_Roehren.htm Die Geschichte der Russischen Roehren] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; US-licensed tubes were produced since then.

Since 2001, [[Sovtek|New Sensor Corp.]] has been holding the rights for the Svetlana vacuum tube brand for the US and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stereophile.com/news/022304svetlana/index.html|title=Svetlana vs. Svetlana|first=Barry|last=Willis|publisher=stereophile|date=23 February 2004|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/2004607303fsupp2d3041574|title=NEW SENSOR CORP. v. CE DISTRIBUTION LLC|publisher=LEAGLE|date=3 February 2004|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Sensor tubes are actually manufactured at the Xpo-pul factory (former Reflektor plant) in [[Saratov]]. Tubes manufactured by Svetlana in Saint Petersburg still bear the "winged ''С''" (cyrillic S) logo (see the image below) but no longer the name Svetlana.

In 2017 the company announced a 3 billion ruble modernization plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=«Светлана» инвестирует 3 млрд рублей в модернизацию и новые разработки|url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2017/07/18/724421-svetlana-investiruet|accessdate=12 October 2017|work=Vedomosti|date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
The Svetlana Association produces a variety of electronic and microelectronic instruments, including transmitting and modulator tubes for all frequency ranges; X-band broadband passive TR limiter; KU-band broadband TR tube; [[klystron]] amplifiers; [[X-ray tube]]s; portable X-ray units for medicine and industry; high-frequency fast response [[thyristors]]; transistors; integrated microcircuits; microcomputers; microcontrollers; microcalculators; ultrasonic delay lines; receiving tubes; process equipment for the manufacture of electronic engineering items.&lt;ref name="rdbd2575"/&gt; Vacuum tubes currently in production include the [[6550]], [[6L6]], [[EL34]], and [[KT88]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sedspb.ru/index.php/-q-q|title=Продукция АО "С.Е.Д.-СПб"|trans-title=Production of AO "S.E.D.-CPB"|language=ru|publisher=Svetlana Electron Devices|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[textile industry]], a '''tow''' is a coarse, broken fibre, removed during processing [[flax]], [[hemp]], or [[jute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|  |title=Tow|website=Glossary of Colonial Terms|publisher= History Online| |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915135150/http://www.chaddsfordhistory.org/history/glossary.htm |date=September 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flax tows are often used as [[upholstery]] stuffing, and tows in general are frequently cut up to produce [[staple fibre]].  The very light color of flax tow is the source of the word "[[wikt:towhead|towhead]]", meaning a person with naturally tousled light blonde hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=towhead |title=Towhead| website= Online Etymology Dictionary|access-date= November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[artificial fibre]] and [[Composite material|composites]] industries, a '''tow''' is an untwisted [[wikt:bundle|bundle]] of continuous [[Filament (textiles)|filaments]], in particular of [[acrylic fibre|acrylic]],  [[carbon fibres]], or [[viscose rayon]]. Tows are designated either by their total [[Tex (unit)|tex]] (mass per unit length) or by the number of fibres they contain.{{dubious|date=May 2017|reason=Not in my experience they aren't, and I used to work in that industry.

The '''[[United States]] [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] Stability and Control Digital DATCOM''' is a computer program that implements the methods contained in the [[USAF Stability and Control DATCOM]] to calculate the static stability, control and dynamic derivative characteristics of [[fixed-wing aircraft]].  Digital DATCOM requires an input file containing a geometric description of an aircraft, and outputs its corresponding dimensionless stability derivatives according to the specified flight conditions.  The values obtained can be used to calculate meaningful aspects of [[flight dynamics]].

== History ==
In February 1976, work commenced to automate the methods contained in the USAF Stability and Control DATCOM, specifically those contained in [[USAF Stability and Control DATCOM#Sections|sections 4, 5, 6 and 7]].  The work was performed by the [[McDonnell Douglas Corporation]] under contract with the United States Air Force in conjunction with engineers at the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory in [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]].  Implementation of the Digital DATCOM concluded in November 1978.

The program is written in [[FORTRAN IV]] and has since been updated; however, the core of the program remains the same.

A report was published, separated into three volumes, which explains the use of Digital DATCOM.  The report consists of
* Volume I, User's Manual
* Volume II, Implementation of DATCOM Methods
* Volume III, Plot Module

== Inputs ==
Section 3 of the USAF Digital DATCOM Manual Volume I defines the inputs available for modeling an aircraft.  The inputs are categorized by namelists to facilitate reading the file into FORTRAN.

=== Flight conditions and options ===
The FLTCON Namelist describes the flight conditions for the case.  A maximum of 400 Mach-altitude combinations can be run at once, with up to 20 [[angles of attack]] for each combination.  The user can specify whether the Mach number and altitude varies together, the [[Mach number]] varies at a constant altitude, or the altitude varies at a constant Mach number.  Both subsonic and supersonic analysis can be run in Digital DATCOM.

The OPTINS Namelist defines the reference parameters for the aircraft.  The theoretical wing area, [[mean aerodynamic chord]], and [[wing span]] are input along with a parameter defining the surface roughness of the aircraft.

=== Synthesis parameters ===
The SYNTHS Namelist allows the user to define the positions of the [[center of gravity]] and apexes of the wings.  The X- and Z- coordinates are needed for the [[wing]], [[tailplane|horizontal tail]], and [[vertical tail]] in order for the aircraft to be synthesized correctly.  DATCOM does not require that the origin for the aircraft has to be the nose of the aircraft; any arbitrary point will do, but all of the dimensions need to be referenced from that point.  [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|Incidence angles]] can also be added to the wing and horizontal tail.

=== Body parameters ===
The BODY Namelist defines the shape of the body.  Digital DATCOM assumes an axisymmetrical shape for the body.  Up to 20 stations can be specified with the fuselage half-width, upper coordinate and lower coordinate being defined at each station.  For supersonic analysis, additional parameters can be input.

=== Wing, Horizontal and Vertical Tail parameters ===
The WGPLNF, HTPLNF and VTPLNF Namelists define the wing, horizontal tail and vertical tail, respectively.  The basic parameters such as root chord, tip chord, half-span, [[Wing twist|twist]], [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] and [[Swept wing|sweep]] are input.  Digital DATCOM also accepts wing planforms which change geometry along the span such as the [[F4 Phantom II]] which had 15 degrees of outboard dihedral.

Canards can also be analyzed in Digital DATCOM.  The [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] must be specified as the forward lifting surface (i.e. wing) and the wing as the aft lift surface.

For airfoil designations, most traditional NACA 4-, 5-, and 6- airfoils can be specified in Digital DATCOM.  Additionally, custom airfoils can be input using the appropriate namelists.  Also, twin vertical tails can be designated in Digital DATCOM, but not twin booms.

=== High Lift and Control Devices ===
Using the SYMFLP and ASYFLP Namelists, [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]], [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevators]], and [[ailerons]] can be defined.  Digital DATCOM allows a multitude of flap types including plain, single-slotted, and fowler flaps.  Up to 9 flap deflections can be analyzed at each Mach-altitude combination.  Unfortunately, the [[rudder]] is not implemented in Digital DATCOM.

Digital DATCOM also offers an automated aircraft TRIM function which calculates elevator deflections needed to [[Longitudinal static stability#Trim|trim]] the aircraft.

=== Other Inputs ===
Other Digital DATCOM inputs include power effects (propeller and jet), ground effects, trim tabs, and experimental data.  The EXPRXX Namelist allows a user to use experimental data (such as coefficient of lift, coefficient of drag, etc.) in lieu of the data Digital DATCOM produces in the intermediate steps of its component build-up.

All dimensions are taken in feet and degrees unless specified otherwise.  Digital DATCOM provides commands for outputting the dynamic derivatives (DAMP) as well as the stability coefficients of each components (BUILD).

== Output ==
Digital DATCOM produces a copious amount of data for the relatively small amount of inputs it requires.  By default, only the data for the aircraft is output, but additional configurations can be output:
* Body alone
* Wing alone
* Horizontal tail alone
* Vertical tail alone
* Wing-Body Configuration
* Body-Horizontal Tail Configuration
* Body-Vertical Tail Configuration
* Wing-Body-Horizontal Tail Configuration
* Wing-Body-Vertical Tail Configuration 
* Wing-Body-Horizontal Tail-Vertical Tail Configuration

For each configuration, stability coefficients and derivatives are output at each angle of attack specified.  The details of this output are defined in Section 6 of the USAF Digital DATCOM Manual Volume I.  The basic output includes:
* C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; - [[Lift Coefficient]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; - [[Drag Coefficient]] 
* C&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; - [[Pitching moment|Pitching Moment Coefficient]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; - Normal Force Coefficient
* C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; - Axial Force Coefficient
* C&lt;sub&gt;Lα&lt;/sub&gt; - Lift Curve Slope (Derivative of Lift Coefficient with respect to angle of attack)
* C&lt;sub&gt;mα&lt;/sub&gt; - Pitching Moment Curve Slope (derivative of Pitching Moment Coefficient with respect to angle of attack)
* C&lt;sub&gt;Yβ&lt;/sub&gt; - Derivative of side-force coefficient with respect to [[sideslip angle]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;nβ&lt;/sub&gt; - Derivative of yawing-moment coefficient with respect to sideslip angle
* C&lt;sub&gt;lβ&lt;/sub&gt; - Derivative of rolling-moment coefficient with respect to sideslip angle

For complete aircraft configurations, [[downwash]] data is also included.

When compared with modern methods of [[computational fluid dynamics]], Digital DATCOM may seem antiquated.  However, in its day, the program was an advanced estimation tool, and certainly much faster than plowing through pages and pages of engineering texts.  Digital DATCOM is no longer supported by the USAF and is now [[public domain]] software.

== Limitations ==
Inlets, external stores, and other protuberances cannot be input because Digital DATCOM analyzes the fuselage as a [[body of revolution]].  The simplification affects the coefficient of drag for the aircraft.

Dynamic derivatives are not output for aircraft that have wings that are not straight-tapered or have [[leading edge extensions]].  This problem can be overcome by using experimental data for the wing-body (using non-straight tapered wing).

There is no method to input twin vertical tails mounted on the fuselage, although there is a method for [[Twin tail|H-Tails]].  This problem can be addressed by approximating the twin vertical tails as a single equivalent vertical tail mounted to the fuselage.

Digital DATCOM cannot provide outputs for the control derivatives with regard to the rudder control surface. According to the manual, there is no any input parameters which define the geometriy of rudder.

Digital DATCOM cannot analyze three lifting surfaces at once, such as a canard-wing-horizontal tail configuration.  This problem can be addressed by superposition of lifting surfaces through the experimental input option.

== Current Development ==
There are intentions among those that use this package to improve the overall package, through an easier user interface, as well as more comprehensive output data.

[[Image:citation_ac.jpg|right|thumb|320px|[[Cessna Citation|Citation]] in AC3D]]

=== DATCOM+ ===
While the original DIGDAT program has been left relatively untouched, there has been a new front-end created that will allow the user to name the input file with something more significant than FOR005.DAT. The new input file format allows the user to place comments in the input file. There have also been hooks placed in the DIGDAT that allow for alternate outputs in addition to the original output format, which is 132 columns wide and slightly user abusive if you intend to import the data into another application. There is a graphical representation of the aircraft output in [[AC3D]], as well as data table output in [[XML]] for the [[JSBSim]] and [[FlightGear]] projects, as well as a free-format LFI (Linear Function Interpolation) data table file.

Along with the DIGDAT program, there are viewers for the AC3D, XML, and LFI format output files. Data tables can easily be output to the screen or to PNG files for inclusion into reports.
[[Image:Navion_in_Datcom3d.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Navion]] in MATLAB]]

=== Mathworks Aerospace Toolbox ===
Aerospace Toolbox includes a function for importing output files from Digital DATCOM into MATLAB. This function lets you collect aerodynamic coefficients from static and dynamic analyses and transfer them into MATLAB as a cell array of structures, with each structure containing information about a Digital DATCOM output file.

=== OpenDatcom ===
OpenDatcom is an open-source GUI for the Digital DATCOM created and hosted by the OpenAE [http://openae.org/software] community. OpenDatcom incorporates all the basic (non-experimental) functionality supported by the Digital DATCOM while providing real-time input error and bounds checking. An alpha version of the program was released November 1, 2009 to the general public. The OpenAE.org web site is no longer active.

=== Predicting Aerodynamics of Structurally Damaged Aircraft ===

There has been some research in using Digital DATCOM in conjunction with wind tunnel studies to predict aerodynamics of structurally impaired aircraft.  Dr. Bilal Siddiqui at [[DHA Suffa University]] presented an approach &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237086362_Using_USAF_DATCOM_to_Predict_Nonlinear_Aerodynamics_of_Structurally_Impaired_Aircraft], Using USAF DATCOM to Predict Nonlinear Aerodynamics of Structurally Impaired Aircraft,&lt;/ref&gt; to predict the nonlinear aerodynamics of a structurally damaged aircraft model based on the engineering level aerodynamic prediction methods, DATCOM. Raw results from the code provide good correlation with wind tunnel data at very low angles of attack, but accuracy deteriorates rapidly as the angle of attack increases. A new methodology is then proposed which combines the experimental results of healthy aircraft with the predicted aerodynamics of the damaged cases, to yield better correlation between experimental and predicted aerodynamic coefficients for damaged aircraft. Three damage-configurations are studied at supersonic speeds. The methodology can be used to quickly generate aerodynamic model for damaged aircraft for simulation and reconfigurable control

{{Infobox uranium}}
'''Uranium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''U''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;92. It is a silvery-grey [[metal]] in the [[actinide]] series of the [[periodic table]]. A uranium atom has 92 [[proton]]s and 92 [[electron]]s, of which 6 are [[valence electron]]s. Uranium is weakly [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] because all [[isotopes of uranium]] are unstable, with [[half-lives]] varying between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years. The most common isotopes in [[natural uranium]] are [[uranium-238]] (which has 146 [[neutron]]s and accounts for over 99%) and [[uranium-235]] (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the highest [[atomic weight]] of the [[primordial nuclide|primordially]] occurring elements. Its [[density]] is about 70% higher than that of [[lead]], and slightly lower than that of [[gold]] or [[tungsten]]. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few [[Parts-per notation#Parts-per expressions|parts per million]] in soil, rock and water, and is commercially [[uranium mining|extracted]] from uranium-bearing [[mineral]]s such as [[uraninite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uranium|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/uranium|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate= 22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2739–99.2752%), uranium-235 (0.7198–0.7202%), and a very small amount of [[uranium-234]] (0.0050–0.0059%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Uranium Isotopes|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/u-isotopes.htm|accessdate = 14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uranium decays slowly by emitting an [[alpha particle]]. The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years and that of uranium-235 is 704 [[million]] years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ie.lbl.gov/toi/nucSearch.asp|title=WWW Table of Radioactive Isotopes|work=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, US|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427084707/http://ie.lbl.gov/toi/nucSearch.asp|archivedate=27 April 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; making them useful in dating the [[age of the Earth]].

Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] properties. Uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring [[fissile]] [[isotope]], which makes it widely used in [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. However, because of the tiny amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo [[uranium enrichment|enrichment]] so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is [[fertile material|fertile]], meaning it can be [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] to fissile [[plutonium-239]] in a [[nuclear reactor]]. Another fissile isotope, [[uranium-233]], can be produced from natural [[thorium]] and is also important in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for [[spontaneous fission]] or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. [[Depleted uranium]] (&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U) is used in [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s and [[vehicle armour|armor plating]].&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks479"&gt;{{Harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=479}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Uranium is used as a colorant in [[uranium glass]], producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for tinting and shading in early [[photography]].

The 1789 [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery]] of uranium in the mineral [[uraninite|pitchblende]] is credited to [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], who named the new element after the recently discovered planet [[Uranus]]. [[Eugène-Melchior Péligot]] was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by [[Henri Becquerel]]. Research by [[Otto Hahn]], [[Lise Meitner]], [[Enrico Fermi]] and others, such as [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in ''[[Little Boy]]'', the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first nuclear weapon used in war]]. An ensuing [[arms race]] during the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived [[plutonium-239]]. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|breakup of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/world/20100218/157925732.html "U.S. to pump money into nuke stockpile, increase security,"] ''RIA Novosti'' 18 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Nuclear proliferation]].

When [[refining (metallurgy)|refined]], uranium is a silvery white, weakly radioactive [[metal]]. It has a [[Hardnesses of the elements (data page)|Mohs hardness]] of 6, sufficient to scratch glass and approximately equal to that of [[titanium]], [[rhodium]], [[manganese]] and [[niobium]]. It is [[malleability|malleable]], [[ductility|ductile]], slightly [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]], strongly [[electronegativity|electropositive]] and a poor [[electrical conductivity|electrical conductor]].&lt;ref name="SciTechEncy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LANL"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hammond, C.

Uranium metal reacts with almost all non-metal elements (with the exception of the [[noble gas]]es) and their [[chemical compound|compounds]], with reactivity increasing with temperature.&lt;ref name="ColumbiaEncy"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=uranium|encyclopedia=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia|url=http://www.answers.com/uranium|publisher=Columbia University Press|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydrochloric acid|Hydrochloric]] and [[nitric acid]]s dissolve uranium, but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly.&lt;ref name="SciTechEncy"/&gt; When finely divided, it can react with cold water; in air, uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of [[uranium oxide]].&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into [[uranium dioxide]] or other chemical forms usable in industry.

Uranium-235 was the first isotope that was found to be [[fissile]]. Other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 [[isotope]] will most of the time divide into two smaller [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], releasing nuclear [[binding energy]] and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a [[nuclear chain reaction]] occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a [[neutron poison]], absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor [[control rod]]s (see [[nuclear reactor physics]] for a description of this process of reactor control).

As little as 15&amp;nbsp;lb (7&amp;nbsp;kg) of uranium-235 can be used to make an atomic bomb.&lt;ref name="EncyIntel"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Espionage, Intelligence, and Security|publisher=The Gale Group, Inc.|title=uranium|url=http://www.answers.com/uranium}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first nuclear bomb used in war, ''[[Little Boy]]'', relied on uranium fission, but the very first nuclear explosive (the ''Gadget'' used at [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]) and the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki (''[[Fat Man]]'') were both plutonium bombs.

Uranium metal has three [[allotropy|allotropic]] forms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KWGu-LYMYjMC&amp;pg=PA108 |page=108 |title=Applications of Texture Analysis |author=Rollett, A. D. |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |date=2008 |isbn=0-470-40835-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Military===
[[File:30mm DU slug.jpg|thumb|left|Various militaries use [[depleted uranium]] as high-density penetrators.|alt=Shiny metallic cylinder with a sharpened tip. The overall length is 9 cm and diameter about 2 cm.]]

The major application of uranium in the military sector is in high-density penetrators. This ammunition consists of [[depleted uranium]] (DU) alloyed with 1–2% other elements, such as [[titanium]] or [[molybdenum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/du_ii/du_ii_tabe.htm#TAB_E_Development_of_DU_Munitions|title=Development of DU Munitions|year=2000|work=Depleted Uranium in the Gulf (II)|publisher=Gulflink, official website of Force Health Protection &amp; Readiness}}&lt;/ref&gt; At high impact speed, the density, hardness, and [[pyrophoricity]] of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets. Tank armor and other removable [[vehicle armor]] can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates. The use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after the use of such munitions by the US, UK and other countries during wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil (see [[Gulf War Syndrome]]).&lt;ref name="EncyIntel"/&gt;

Depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than [[lead]] in halting radiation from strong sources such as [[radium]].&lt;ref name="SciTechEncy"/&gt; Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile [[atmospheric reentry|re-entry vehicles]] and as a shielding material.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; Due to its high density, this material is found in [[inertial guidance system]]s and in [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] [[compass]]es.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost.&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks480"&gt;{{Harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=480}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by [[uranium oxide]] rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak [[alpha decay|alpha emitter]]).

During the later stages of [[World War II]], the entire [[Cold War]], and to a lesser extent afterwards, uranium-235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses [[plutonium-239]] derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb ([[thermonuclear weapon]]) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of [[tritium]] and [[deuterium]] to undergo [[nuclear fusion]]. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by [[fast neutron]]s from the nuclear fusion process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Civilian===
[[File:Nuclear Power Plant 2.jpg|thumb|The most visible civilian use of uranium is as the thermal power source used in [[nuclear power plant]]s.|alt=Photograph featuring sunflowers in front and a plant on the back. The plant has a wide smoking chimney with diameter comparable to its height.]]

The main use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel [[nuclear power plant]]s. One kilogram of uranium-235 can theoretically produce about [[orders of magnitude (energy)|20&amp;nbsp;terajoules]] of energy (2{{e|13}}&amp;nbsp;[[joule]]s), assuming complete fission; as much [[energy]] as 1500 [[tonne]]s of [[coal]].&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks479"/&gt;

Commercial [[nuclear power]] plants use fuel that is typically enriched to around 3% uranium-235.&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks479"/&gt; The [[CANDU reactor|CANDU]] and [[Magnox]] designs are the only commercial reactors capable of using unenriched uranium fuel. Fuel used for [[United States Navy]] reactors is typically highly enriched in [[uranium-235]] (the exact values are [[classified information|classified]]). In a [[breeder reactor]], uranium-238 can also be converted into [[plutonium]] through the following reaction:&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt;

[[File:U glass with black light.jpg|thumb|left|Uranium glass glowing under [[ultraviolet|UV light]]|alt=A glass place on a glass stand. The plate is glowing green while the stand is colorless.]]
Before (and, occasionally, after) the discovery of radioactivity, uranium was primarily used in small amounts for yellow glass and pottery glazes, such as [[uranium glass]] and in [[Fiesta (dinnerware)|Fiestaware]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hlchina.com/gmastatement.html "Statement regarding the ''Good Morning America'' broadcast," The Homer Laughlin China Co.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401000958/http://www.hlchina.com/gmastatement.html |date=1 April 2012 }}, 16 March 2011, accessed 25 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery and isolation of [[radium]] in uranium ore (pitchblende) by [[Marie Curie]] sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15520902.900-dial-r-for-radioactive.html |title=Dial R for radioactive – 12 July 1997 – New Scientist |publisher=Newscientist.com |accessdate=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one [[gram]] of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery glazes, [[uranium tile]] glazes accounted for the bulk of the use, including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, [[mauve]], black, blue, red and other colors.

[[File:Vacuum capacitor with uranium glass.jpg|thumb|Uranium glass used as lead-in seals in a vacuum [[capacitor]]|alt=A glass cylinder capped on both ends with metal electrodes. Inside the glass bulb there is a metal cylinder connected to the electrodes.]]
Uranium was also used in [[photography|photographic]] chemicals (especially [[uranium nitrate]] as a [[toner]]),&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; in lamp filaments for [[stage lighting]] bulbs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/health/contaminants/radiation/pdfs/Uranium%20Fact%20Sheet%20final.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=20 September 2014 |title=EPA Facts about Uranium |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; to improve the appearance of [[dentures]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/consumer%20products/dentures.htm |title=Uranium Containing Dentures (ca. 1960s, 1970s) |publisher=[[Oak Ridge Associated Universities]] |website=Health Physics Historical Instrumentation Museum Collection |date=1999 |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the leather and wood industries for stains and dyes. Uranium salts are [[mordant]]s of silk or wool. Uranyl acetate and uranyl formate are used as electron-dense "stains" in [[transmission electron microscopy]], to increase the contrast of biological specimens in ultrathin sections and in [[negative staining]] of [[virus]]es, isolated [[cell organelle]]s and [[macromolecule]]s.

The discovery of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element. The long [[half-life]] of the isotope uranium-238 (4.51{{e|9}} years) makes it well-suited for use in estimating the age of the earliest [[igneous rock]]s and for other types of [[radiometric dating]], including [[uranium–thorium dating]], [[uranium–lead dating]] and [[uranium–uranium dating]]. Uranium metal is used for [[X-ray]] targets in the making of high-energy X-rays.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt;

==History==

===Pre-discovery use===
[[File:Uranus as seen by NASA's Voyager 2.tif|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The planet [[Uranus]], which uranium is named after]]
The use of uranium in its natural [[oxide]] form dates back to at least the year 79 [[Common Era|CE]], when it was used to add a yellow color to [[ceramic]] glazes.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; Yellow glass with 1% uranium oxide was found in a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] villa on Cape [[Posillipo]] in the [[Gulf of Naples|Bay of Naples]], Italy, by R. T. Gunther of the [[University of Oxford]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks482"&gt;{{Harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=482}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the late [[Middle Ages]], pitchblende was extracted from the [[Habsburg]] silver mines in [[Jáchymov|Joachimsthal]], [[Bohemia]] (now Jáchymov in the Czech Republic), and was used as a coloring agent in the local [[glass]]making industry.&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks477"/&gt; In the early 19th century, the world's only known sources of uranium ore were these mines.

===Discovery===
[[File:Becquerel plate.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Becquerel|Antoine Henri Becquerel]] discovered the phenomenon of [[radioactivity]] by exposing a [[photographic plate]] to uranium in 1896.|alt=Two fuzzy black features on a fuzzy white paper-like background. There is a handwriting at the top of the picture.]]
The [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery]] of the element is credited to the German chemist [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]]. While he was working in his experimental laboratory in [[Berlin]] in 1789, Klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound (likely [[sodium diuranate]]) by dissolving [[pitchblende]] in [[nitric acid]] and neutralizing the solution with [[sodium hydroxide]].&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks477"&gt;{{Harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=477}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Klaproth assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yet-undiscovered element and heated it with [[charcoal]] to obtain a black powder, which he thought was the newly discovered metal itself (in fact, that powder was an oxide of uranium).&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks477"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1841, [[Eugène-Melchior Péligot]], Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the [[Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers]] (Central School of Arts and Manufactures) in [[Paris]], isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating [[uranium tetrachloride]] with [[potassium]].&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks477"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Recherches Sur L'Uranium

[[Henri Becquerel]] discovered [[radioactive decay|radioactivity]] by using uranium in 1896.&lt;ref name="ColumbiaEncy"/&gt; Becquerel made the discovery in Paris by leaving a sample of a uranium salt, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;Sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (potassium uranyl sulfate), on top of an unexposed [[photographic plate]] in a drawer and noting that the plate had become "fogged".&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks478"/&gt; He determined that a form of invisible light or rays emitted by uranium had exposed the plate.

===Fission research===
[[File:UraniumCubesLarge.jpg|thumb|Cubes and cuboids of uranium produced during the Manhattan project]]
A team led by [[Enrico Fermi]] in 1934 observed that bombarding uranium with neutrons produces the emission of [[beta decay|beta rays]] ([[electron]]s or [[positron]]s from the elements produced; see [[beta particle]]).&lt;ref name="EncyChem773"/&gt; The fission products were at first mistaken for new elements with atomic numbers 93 and 94, which the Dean of the Faculty of Rome, Orso Mario Corbino, christened ''[[ausonium]]'' and ''[[hesperium]]'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939, and later work found that on average about 2.5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium-235.&lt;ref name="EncyChem773"/&gt; Fermi urged [[Alfred O. C.

These discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and [[nuclear power]].

On 2 December 1942, as part of the [[Manhattan Project]], another team led by Enrico Fermi was able to initiate the first artificial self-sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]], [[Chicago Pile-1]]. An initial plan using enriched uranium-235 was abandoned as it was as yet unavailable in sufficient quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2013/ph241/masters1/|title=Chicago Pile One|website=large.stanford.edu|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working in a lab below the stands of [[Stagg Field]] at the [[University of Chicago]], the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400&amp;nbsp;[[short tons]] (360&amp;nbsp;[[metric tons]]) of [[graphite]], 58&amp;nbsp;short tons (53&amp;nbsp;metric tons) of [[uranium oxide]], and six short tons (5.5 metric tons) of uranium metal, a majority of which was supplied by [[Westinghouse Lamp Plant]] in a makeshift production process.&lt;ref name="EncyChem773"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=John|title=A Manhattan Project Postscript|journal=Science|date=19 June 1981|volume=212|pages=1369–1371|url=http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0533/ML053340429.pdf|accessdate=23 March 2013|publisher=AAAS|bibcode = 1981Sci...212.1369W |doi = 10.1126/science.212.4501.1369|pmid=17746246|issue=4501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear weaponry===
[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima - NARA 542192 - Edit.jpg|thumb|The [[mushroom cloud]] over [[Hiroshima]] after the dropping of the uranium-based atomic bomb nicknamed '[[Little Boy]]'|alt=White fragmentred mushroom-like smoke cloud evolving from the ground.]]
Two major types of atomic bombs were developed by the United States during [[World War II]]: a uranium-based device (codenamed "[[Little Boy]]") whose fissile material was highly [[enriched uranium]], and a plutonium-based device (see [[Trinity test]] and "[[Fat Man]]") whose plutonium was derived from uranium-238. The uranium-based Little Boy device became the first nuclear weapon used in war when it was detonated over the [[Japan]]ese city of [[Hiroshima]] on 6 August 1945. Exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500&amp;nbsp;tonnes of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings and killed approximately 75,000 people (see [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]).&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks478"/&gt; Initially it was believed that uranium was relatively rare, and that [[nuclear proliferation]] could be avoided by simply buying up all known uranium stocks, but within a decade large deposits of it were discovered in many places around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Helmreich, J.E.

The [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, formerly known as the Clinton Pile and X-10 Pile, was the world's second artificial nuclear reactor (after Enrico Fermi's Chicago Pile) and was the first reactor designed and built for continuous operation.

During the [[Cold War]] between the Soviet Union and the United States, huge stockpiles of uranium were amassed and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium. Since the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|break-up of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, an estimated 600&amp;nbsp;short tons (540&amp;nbsp;metric tons) of highly enriched weapons grade uranium (enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads) have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] and several other former Soviet states.&lt;ref name="EncyIntel"/&gt; Police in [[Asia]], [[Europe]], and [[South America]] on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have [[nuclear espionage|intercepted shipments]] of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium, most of which was from ex-Soviet sources.&lt;ref name="EncyIntel"/&gt; From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program, operated by the [[federal government of the United States]], spent approximately [[United States dollar|US $]]550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia.&lt;ref name="EncyIntel"/&gt; This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities.

In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble carbonate complexes at alkaline pH. This leads to an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH. A ''Sphingomonas'' sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in ''E. coli''.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Uranium tetrafluoride|{{chem|UF|4}}]], dissolved in molten [[calcium chloride]] ({{chem|Ca[[chloride|Cl]]|2}}) and [[sodium chloride]] ([[sodium|Na]]Cl) solution.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; Very pure uranium is produced through the [[thermal decomposition]] of uranium halides on a hot filament.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt;

===Resources and reserves===
It is estimated that 5.5 million tonnes of uranium exists in ore reserves that are economically viable at US$59 per lb of uranium,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/ENF_Exploration_drives_uranium_resources_up_17_0206082.html |title=Exploration drives uranium resources up 17% |publisher=World-nuclear-news.org |accessdate=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 35 million tonnes are classed as mineral resources (reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction).&lt;ref name="IAEAResourcesDemand"/&gt; Prices went from about $10/lb in May 2003 to $138/lb in July 2007. This has caused a big increase in spending on exploration,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; with US$200 million being spent worldwide in 2005, a 54% increase on the previous year.&lt;ref name="IAEAResourcesDemand"/&gt; This trend continued through 2006, when expenditure on exploration rocketed to over $774 million, an increase of over 250% compared to 2004. The [[OECD]] [[Nuclear Energy Agency]] said exploration figures for 2007 would likely match those for 2006.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Australia has 31% of the world's known uranium ore reserves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf75.html |title=Supply of Uranium}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the world's largest single uranium deposit, located at the [[Olympic Dam, South Australia|Olympic Dam]] Mine in [[South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uranium Mining and Processing in South Australia |url=http://www.uraniumsa.org/processing/processing.htm |accessdate=14 January 2007 |publisher=South Australian Chamber of Mines and Energy |date=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106005859/http://www.uraniumsa.org/processing/processing.htm |archivedate=6 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a significant reserve of uranium

In other words, there is little high grade ore and proportionately much more low grade ore available.

==Compounds==
[[File:Uranium reactions.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Reactions of uranium metal]]

===Oxidation states and oxides===

====Oxides====
{{double image|right|U3O8lattice.jpg|200|UO2lattice.jpg|125|[[Triuranium octoxide]] (left) and [[uranium dioxide]] (right) are the two most common uranium oxides.||Ball and stick model of layered crystal structure containing two types of atoms.|Ball and stick model of cubic-like crystal structure containing two types of atoms.}}

Calcined uranium yellowcake, as produced in many large mills, contains a distribution of uranium oxidation species in various forms ranging from most oxidized to least oxidized. Particles with short residence times in a calciner will generally be less oxidized than those with long retention times or particles recovered in the stack scrubber. Uranium content is usually referenced to {{chem|U|3|O|8}}, which dates to the days of the [[Manhattan Project]] when {{chem|U|3|O|8}} was used as an analytical chemistry reporting standard.

[[Phase (matter)|Phase relationships]] in the uranium-oxygen system are complex. The most important oxidation states of uranium are uranium(IV) and uranium(VI), and their two corresponding [[oxide]]s are, respectively, [[uranium dioxide]] ({{chem|UO|2}}) and [[uranium trioxide]] ({{chem|UO|3}}).&lt;ref name="EncyChem779"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seaborg|1968|p=779}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[uranium oxide]]s such as uranium monoxide (UO), diuranium pentoxide ({{chem|U|2|O|5}}), and uranium peroxide ({{chem|UO|4|·2H|2|O}}) also exist.

The most common forms of uranium oxide are [[triuranium octoxide]] ({{chem|U|3|O|8}}) and {{chem|UO|2}}.&lt;ref name="ANL-Chem"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/guide/ucompound/forms/index.cfm |title=Chemical Forms of Uranium |accessdate=18 February 2007 |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both oxide forms are solids that have low solubility in water and are relatively stable over a wide range of environmental conditions. Triuranium octoxide is (depending on conditions) the most stable compound of uranium and is the form most commonly found in nature. Uranium dioxide is the form in which uranium is most commonly used as a nuclear reactor fuel.&lt;ref name="ANL-Chem"/&gt; At ambient temperatures, {{chem|UO|2}} will gradually convert to {{chem|U|3|O|8}}. Because of their stability, uranium oxides are generally considered the preferred chemical form for storage or disposal.&lt;ref name="ANL-Chem"/&gt;

====Aqueous chemistry====
[[File:U Oxstufen.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Uranium in its oxidation states III, IV, V, VI]]
Salts of many [[oxidation state]]s of uranium are water-[[solubility|soluble]] and may be studied in [[aqueous solution]]s. The most common ionic forms are {{chem|U|3+}} (brown-red), {{chem|U|4+}} (green), {{chem|UO|2|+}} (unstable), and {{chem|UO|2|2+}} (yellow), for U(III), U(IV), U(V), and U(VI), respectively.&lt;ref name="EncyChem778"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seaborg|1968|p=778}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A few [[solid]] and semi-metallic compounds such as UO and US exist for the formal oxidation state uranium(II), but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state. Ions of {{chem|U|3+}} liberate [[hydrogen]] from [[water]] and are therefore considered to be highly unstable. The {{chem|UO|2|2+}} ion represents the uranium(VI) state and is known to form compounds such as [[uranyl carbonate]], [[uranyl chloride]] and [[uranyl sulfate]]. {{chem|UO|2|2+}} also forms [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]] with various [[organic compound|organic]] [[chelation|chelating]] agents, the most commonly encountered of which is [[uranyl acetate]].&lt;ref name="EncyChem778"/&gt;

Unlike the uranyl salts of uranium and [[polyatomic ion]] uranium-oxide cationic forms, the [[uranate]]s, salts containing a polyatomic uranium-oxide anion, are generally not water-soluble.

====Carbonates====
The interactions of carbonate anions with uranium(VI) cause the [[Pourbaix diagram]] to change greatly when the medium is changed from water to a carbonate containing solution. While the vast majority of carbonates are insoluble in water (students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water), uranium carbonates are often soluble in water. This is because a U(VI) cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes.

|}

====Effects of pH====
The uranium fraction diagrams in the presence of carbonate illustrate this further: when the pH of a uranium(VI) solution increases, the uranium is converted to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and at high pHs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex.

When carbonate is added, uranium is converted to a series of carbonate complexes if the pH is increased. One effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the pH range 6 to 8, a fact that has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuels.

===Hydrides, carbides and nitrides===
Uranium metal heated to {{convert|250|to|300|C|F}} reacts with [[hydrogen]] to form [[uranium hydride]]. Even higher temperatures will reversibly remove the hydrogen. This property makes uranium hydrides convenient starting materials to create reactive uranium powder along with various uranium [[carbide]], [[nitride]], and [[halide]] compounds.&lt;ref name="EncyChem782"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seaborg|1968|p=782}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two crystal modifications of uranium hydride exist: an α form that is obtained at low temperatures and a β form that is created when the formation temperature is above 250&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="EncyChem782"/&gt;

[[Uranium carbide]]s and [[uranium nitride]]s are both relatively [[Chemically inert|inert]] [[semimetal]]lic compounds that are minimally soluble in [[acid]]s, react with water, and can ignite in [[air]] to form {{chem|U|3|O|8}}.&lt;ref name="EncyChem782"/&gt; Carbides of uranium include uranium monocarbide (U[[carbon|C]]), uranium dicarbide ({{chem|UC|2}}), and diuranium tricarbide ({{chem|U|2|C|3}}). Both UC and {{chem|UC|2}} are formed by adding carbon to molten uranium or by exposing the metal to [[carbon monoxide]] at high temperatures. Stable below 1800&amp;nbsp;°C, {{chem|U|2|C|3}} is prepared by subjecting a heated mixture of UC and {{chem|UC|2}} to mechanical stress.&lt;ref name="EncyChem780"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seaborg|1968|p=780}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Uranium nitrides obtained by direct exposure of the metal to [[nitrogen]] include uranium mononitride (UN), uranium dinitride ({{chem|UN|2}}), and diuranium trinitride ({{chem|U|2|N|3}}).&lt;ref name="EncyChem780"/&gt;

===Halides===
[[File:Uranium hexafluoride crystals sealed in an ampoule.jpg|thumb|[[Uranium hexafluoride]] is the feedstock used to separate uranium-235 from natural uranium.|alt=Snow-like substance in a sealed glass ampoule.]]
&lt;!--[[File:Uranium-hexafluoride-2D-V2.svg|thumb|upright|[[Uranium hexafluoride]] is the feedstock used to separate uranium-235 from natural uranium.|alt=Skeletal diagram of a chemical compound having a uranium atom in its center bonded to 6 fluorine atoms.]]--&gt;
All uranium fluorides are created using [[uranium tetrafluoride]] ({{chem|UF|4}}); {{chem|UF|4}} itself is prepared by hydrofluorination of uranium dioxide.&lt;ref name="EncyChem782"/&gt; Reduction of {{chem|UF|4}} with hydrogen at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C produces uranium trifluoride ({{chem|UF|3}}). Under the right conditions of temperature and pressure, the reaction of solid {{chem|UF|4}} with gaseous [[uranium hexafluoride]] ({{chem|UF|6}}) can form the intermediate fluorides of {{chem|U|2|F|9}}, {{chem|U|4|F|17}}, and {{chem|UF|5}}.&lt;ref name="EncyChem782"/&gt;

At room temperatures, {{chem|UF|6}} has a high [[vapor pressure]], making it useful in the [[gaseous diffusion]] process to separate the rare uranium-235 from the common uranium-238 isotope. This compound can be prepared from uranium dioxide and uranium hydride by the following process:&lt;ref name="EncyChem782"/&gt;

:{{chem|UO|2}} + 4 HF → {{chem|UF|4}} + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}} (500&amp;nbsp;°C, endothermic)
:{{chem|UF|4}} + {{chem|F|2}} → {{chem|UF|6}} (350&amp;nbsp;°C, endothermic)

The resulting {{chem|UF|6}}, a white solid, is highly [[chemical reaction|reactive]] (by fluorination), easily [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimes]] (emitting a vapor that behaves as a nearly [[ideal gas]]), and is the most volatile compound of uranium known to exist.&lt;ref name="EncyChem782"/&gt;

One method of preparing [[uranium tetrachloride]] ({{chem|UCl|4}}) is to directly combine [[chlorine]] with either uranium metal or uranium hydride. The reduction of {{chem|UCl|4}} by hydrogen produces uranium trichloride ({{chem|UCl|3}}) while the higher chlorides of uranium are prepared by reaction with additional chlorine.&lt;ref name="EncyChem782"/&gt; All uranium chlorides react with water and air.

[[Bromide]]s and [[iodide]]s of uranium are formed by direct reaction of, respectively, [[bromine]] and [[iodine]] with uranium or by adding {{chem|UH|3}} to those element's acids.&lt;ref name="EncyChem782"/&gt; Known examples include: {{chem|UBr|3}}, {{chem|UBr|4}}, {{chem|UI|3}}, and {{chem|UI|4}}. Uranium oxyhalides are water-soluble and include {{chem|UO|2|F|2}}, {{chem|UOCl|2}}, {{chem|UO|2|Cl|2}}, and {{chem|UO|2|Br|2}}. Stability of the oxyhalides decrease as the [[atomic weight]] of the component halide increases.&lt;ref name="EncyChem782"/&gt;

==Isotopes==
&lt;!--[[File:Uranium enrichment proportions.svg|thumb|upright=0.55|Pie-graphs showing the relative proportions of uranium-238 (blue) and uranium-235 (red) at different levels of enrichment]]--&gt;

===Natural concentrations===
{{Main|Isotopes of uranium}}
[[Natural uranium]] consists of three major [[isotope]]s: [[uranium-238]] (99.28% [[natural abundance]]), uranium-235 (0.71%), and [[uranium-234]] (0.0054%). All three are [[radioactive decay|radioactive]], emitting [[alpha particle]]s, with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing [[spontaneous fission]], rather than [[alpha emission]]. There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is formed when &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U undergoes spontaneous fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to [[neptunium-237]]; and finally, uranium-233, which is formed in the [[decay chain]] of that neptunium-237. It is also expected that [[thorium-232]] should be able to undergo [[double beta decay]], which would produce uranium-232, but this has not yet been observed experimentally.&lt;ref name=NUBASE&gt;{{cite journal|author=G. Audi |author2=A. H. Wapstra |author3=C. Thibault |author4=J. Blachot |author5=O. Bersillon |last-author-amp=yes |date=2003 |title=The NUBASE evaluation of nuclear and decay properties |url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |journal=[[Nuclear Physics A]] |volume=729 |pages=3–128 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 |bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923135135/http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uranium-238 is the most stable isotope of uranium, with a [[half-life]] of about 4.468{{e|9}} years, roughly the [[age of the Earth]]. Uranium-235 has a half-life of about 7.13{{e|8}} years, and uranium-234 has a half-life of about 2.48{{e|5}} years.&lt;ref name="EncyChem777"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seaborg|1968|p=777}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
For natural uranium, about 49% of its alpha rays are emitted by each of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U atom, and also 49% by &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U (since the latter is formed from the former) and about 2.0% of them by the &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. When the Earth was young, probably about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235, but the percentage of &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U was probably much lower than this.

Uranium-238 is usually an α emitter (occasionally, it undergoes spontaneous fission), decaying through the [[decay chain#Uranium series|uranium series]], which has 18 members, into [[lead#Isotopes|lead-206]], by a variety of different decay paths.&lt;ref name="ColumbiaEncy"/&gt;

The [[decay chain]] of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U, which is called the [[decay chain#Actinium series|actinium series]], has 15 members and eventually decays into lead-207.&lt;ref name="ColumbiaEncy"/&gt; The constant rates of decay in these decay series makes the comparison of the ratios of parent to [[decay product|daughter elements]] useful in [[radiometric dating]].

Uranium-234, which is a member of the uranium series (the decay chain of uranium-238), decays to lead-206 through a series of relatively short-lived isotopes.

Uranium-233 is made from [[thorium#Isotopes|thorium-232]] by neutron bombardment, usually in a nuclear reactor, and &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U is also fissile.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; Its decay chain forms part of the [[decay chain#Neptunium series|neptunium series]] and ends at [[bismuth-209]] and [[thallium]]-205.

Uranium-235 is important for both [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s, because it is the only uranium isotope existing in nature on Earth in any significant amount that is [[fissile]]. This means that it can be split into two or three fragments ([[fission products]]) by thermal neutrons.&lt;ref name="ColumbiaEncy"/&gt;

Uranium-238 is not fissile, but is a fertile isotope, because after [[neutron activation]] it can produce [[plutonium-239]], another fissile isotope. Indeed, the &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce the radioactive isotope [[uranium-239]]. &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;U decays by [[beta emission]] to [[neptunium]]-239, also a beta-emitter, that decays in its turn, within a few days into plutonium-239. &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu was used as fissile material in the first [[atomic bomb]] detonated in the "[[Trinity test]]" on 15 July 1945 in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="EncyChem773"/&gt;

===Enrichment===
{{Main|Enriched uranium}}
[[File:Gas centrifuge cascade.jpg|thumb|Cascades of [[gas centrifuge]]s are used to enrich uranium ore to concentrate its fissionable isotopes.|alt=A photo of a large hall filled with arrays of long white standing cylinders.]]
In nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and uranium-235 (0.7204%). [[Isotope separation]] concentrates (enriches) the fissionable uranium-235 for nuclear weapons and most nuclear power plants, except for [[gas cooled reactor]]s and [[pressurised heavy water reactor]]s. Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the [[nuclear chain reaction]]. The concentration and amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve this is called a '[[critical mass]]'.

To be considered 'enriched', the uranium-235 fraction should be between 3% and 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/guide/depletedu/enrich/index.cfm |title=Uranium Enrichment |accessdate=11 February 2007 |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium-235 and with a correspondingly increased fraction of uranium-238, called depleted uranium or 'DU'. To be considered 'depleted', the uranium-235 isotope concentration should be no more than 0.3%.&lt;ref name="paducah"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wise-uranium.org/dhap991.html |title=Depleted Uranium: a by-product of the Nuclear Chain |accessdate=31 July 2009 |publisher=Laka Foundation |author=Diehl, Peter |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130113114319/http://www.wise-uranium.org/dhap991.html |archivedate=13 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The price of uranium has risen since 2001, so enrichment tailings containing more than 0.35% uranium-235 are being considered for re-enrichment, driving the price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above $130 per kilogram in July 2007 from $5 in 2001.&lt;ref name="paducah"/&gt;

The [[gas centrifuge]] process, where gaseous [[uranium hexafluoride]] ({{chem|UF|6}}) is separated by the difference in molecular weight between &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; using high-speed [[centrifuge]]s, is the cheapest and leading enrichment process.&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks478"&gt;{{Harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=478}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gaseous diffusion]] process had been the leading method for enrichment and was used in the [[Manhattan Project]]. In this process, uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly [[diffusion|diffused]] through a [[silver]]-[[zinc]] membrane, and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate (since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-235).&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks478"/&gt; The [[molecular laser isotope separation]] method employs a [[laser]] beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine. This leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution.&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks479"/&gt; An alternative laser method of enrichment is known as [[atomic vapor laser isotope separation]] (AVLIS) and employs visible [[tunable laser]]s such as [[dye laser]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=[[F. J. Duarte|Duarte, F. J.]] |editor2=Hillman, L.

==Human exposure==
A person can be exposed to uranium (or its [[decay product|radioactive daughters]], such as [[radon]]) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of uranium in air is usually very small; however, people who work in factories that process [[phosphate]] [[fertilizer]]s, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium [[weapons]] have been used, or live or work near a [[coal]]-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process uranium ore, or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium.&lt;ref name="EPA-Rad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/uranium.html |accessdate=31 July 2009 |title=Radiation Information for Uranium |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ATSDR-ToxFAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts150.html |title=ToxFAQ for Uranium |publisher=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |date=September 1999 |accessdate=18 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the [[permissible exposure limit]] for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 0.2&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. At levels of 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, uranium is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC – NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards – Uranium (insoluble compounds, as U)|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0650.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ingested uranium is excreted during [[digestion]]. Only 0.5% is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium, such as its oxide, are ingested, whereas absorption of the more soluble [[uranyl]] ion can be up to 5%.&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks477"/&gt; However, soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body, whereas insoluble uranium compounds, especially when inhaled by way of dust into the [[lung]]s, pose a more serious exposure hazard. After entering the bloodstream, the absorbed uranium tends to [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] and stay for many years in [[bone]] tissue because of uranium's affinity for phosphates.&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks477"/&gt; Uranium is not absorbed through the skin, and [[alpha particle]]s released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin.

Incorporated uranium becomes [[uranyl]] ions, which accumulate in bone, liver, kidney, and reproductive tissues.

===Effects and precautions===
Normal functioning of the [[kidney]], [[brain]], [[liver]], [[heart]], and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because, besides being weakly radioactive, uranium is a [[toxic metal]].&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks477"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Craft04&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1977">The '''VBER-300''' is a proposed Russian [[pressurized water reactor]] of 325-MWe generating capacity designed for remote locations. The exterior containment structure is 16 meters high and the working section, built with transportable modules, weighs 1300 tonnes. The external steam plant can have a 917&amp;nbsp;MW thermal-steam only capacity, or 325&amp;nbsp;MW steam-turbine-electrical capacity, or a mixture of capacities relating to the four primary steam loops.&lt;ref&gt;https://aris.iaea.org/sites/..%5CPDF%5CVBER-300.pdf Status report 66 - VBER-300&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, it has been proposed in a more powerful sister ship to the [[Akademik Lomonosov]] (2010) for possible use on the [[Russian floating nuclear power station]] (two reactors on a 49,000-tonne barge). The reactor could be used on a 200&amp;ndash;500&amp;nbsp;MW barge that is expected to be completed by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2015-08-russia-announces-second-floating-nuclear-plant-as-new-problems-plague-its-first&lt;/ref&gt;

The reactor has been proposed for use in [[water desalination]], [[district heating]] and/or [[electrical generation]].

The VBER-300 would use [[VVER]]-type fuel.
It was developed by [[OKBM Afrikantov]] in cooperation with [[Kurchatov Institute]].

The '''VLCC ''Metula''''' was a [[supertanker]] that was involved in an [[oil spill]] in [[Tierra del Fuego]], [[Chile]] in 1974. The ship was a [[Very Large Crude Carrier]] (VLCC), with a length of 1,067 feet, draft of 62 feet and a deadweight ton capacity of 206,000. It was the first VLCC supertanker to be involved in a major oil spill.

The ''Metula'' was sailing from [[Ras Tanura]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] with a load of over 196,000 [[ton]]s of light Arabian crude oil destined for delivery to the Chilean National Oil Company (ENAP) at [[Quintero]], [[Chile]].

On the evening of August 9, 1974, the tanker was passing through the [[First Narrows]] area, which is over three and half kilometers wide, of the [[Strait of Magellan]], during severe tidal and current conditions. The ''Metula'' cut a corner too sharp, hitting a 40-foot [[shoal]] and grounding itself. The difficulty of navigating a ship of such size, with minimum navigation aids, contributed to the accident.

On the second day after the grounding, the ''Metula'' swung to starboard, holing and flooding its engine room compartments. The [[U.S. Coast Guard]], at the request of the Chilean government played a role in removing the cargo from the ship.

The tanker released about 47,000 [[tonnes]] of Arabian [[light crude oil]] and between 3,000 and 4,000 tonnes of heavy [[fuel oil]]. The rough sea conditions resulted in the formation of a water-in-oil [[emulsion]], which then landed on the shores of [[Tierra del Fuego]].

The ''Metula'' was refloated on September 25, 1974, and was towed to Isla Grande, near [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] to be scrapped.

No cleanup operation was executed due to the remoteness of the area; on many shorelines, the oil formed hard [[asphalt]] pavements. One marsh received thick deposits of [[mousse]], which were still visible two decades after the disaster. By 1998, most of the oil deposits had broken up, though asphalt pavement remained in a relatively sheltered area, making it among the longest-term contamination recorded for an oil spill.

==Effects==
Following the spill, there were significant negative impacts on the Chilean fishermen. The oil spill resulted in the heavy contamination of the waters of straits of Magellan- forcing Chilean Fishermen to other waters. The Straits were often turned to by the fishermen to hunt [[Dissostichus|sea bass]] when they weren't hunting [[king crab]]. As a result of the spill, the fisheries were rendered unusable for an entire year for the Chilean fishermen. In addition, the overall quality of the fish remained poorer for a long time proceeding.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;O'TooleWashington Post Staff Writer, By Thomas.

ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Washington Post (1877-1997). http://search.proquest.com/docview/146288377&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological Impact==
One of the most significant impacts of the spill was its effect on marine water fowl. A survey conducted between September 14 and 15, 1974 found 408
cormorants, 66 penguins, 23 ducks, and 84 seagulls dead because of heavy oiling between Punta Piedra and Punta Anegada.&lt;ref name="gpo"&gt;Metula oil spill El derramamiento petrolfero del Metula.

Retrieved April 2, 2014, from http://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk3/1975/7508/750815.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, additional ecological damage was heavily noted in the littoral zone, where rich populations of mussels as well as populations of [[limpet]]s and [[starfish]] were found to be heavily oil coated. The value of these organisms as food for other species was highly evident by the number of shell middens prevalent behind many of the local habitations. Thus, the spill had a  negative impact to several food chains of that region.&lt;ref name="princeton" /&gt; Moreover, two years after the spill, the geographic area still appeared devastated and there were no signs of any regrowth of vegetation.

==Economic Impact==
The overall economic damage to [[Chile]] would be considered minor. However, The main economic stress that was prevalent was the tremendous difficulty to arrange logistical and manpower resources, and the cost of implementing a plan and managing the clean up.&lt;ref name="princeton" /&gt; The estimated clean up cost of the spill ranged from 25 million to as high as 50 million US dollars.&lt;ref name="washpost" /&gt;

The '''Walter Reed Tropical Medicine Course''' (now called ''''Operational Clinical Infectious Disease' Course''' ) at [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research|Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR)]] is one of the many Tropical Medicine Training Courses available in the US and worldwide (see [[Tropical medicine]]). It is an intensive 5-day course and a 3-day short course, created to familiarize students with tropical diseases they may encounter overseas.  The course is open to [[Physicians]], [[Physician assistant|Physician Assistants]], [[Nurse practitioner|Nurse Practitioners]], [http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/amedd-categories/medical-service-corps-jobs/environmental-scientist.html ESO], [http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/browse-career-and-job-categories/combat/special-forces-medical-sergeant.html 18D], or other medical personnel.  The course is run by the military and designed for personnel of the US Military ([[US Army|Army]], [[US Marines|Marines]], [[US Navy|Navy]], [[US Air Force|Air Force]]) and several other [[List of United States federal agencies|US government agencies]].

==History==
[[File:The WRAIR.jpg|thumb|''Location of the Walter Reed Tropical Medicine Course within [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]]'']]
The [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research|Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR)]] was established in 1893 as the [[Army Medical School]] by [[War Department (US)|War Department]] [[General order|General Orders]] No. 51, dated 24 Jan 1893.&lt;ref&gt;CATALOGUE OF THE PUBLIC DOCUMENTS OF THE FIFTY-THIRD CONGRESS AND OF ALL DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE PERIOD FROM March 4, 1893, To June 30, 1895, page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tropical Medicine course began in that school in July 1941 while [[George Russell Callendar|BG G. Russell Callendar]] was Commandant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillip|first=LC|year=1946|title=Medicine and the War|journal=JAMA|issue= |pages=1166|publisher= |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/130/16/1166.full.pdf|accessdate=April 20, 2011|volume=130|doi=10.1001/jama.1946.02870160112014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the course ran for 30 days and consisted of didactic and laboratory sessions similar to today’s course. Very much like the majority of the 52 years that this course was offered at [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research|WRAIR]], that first course presented continuing education to approximately 30 officers.&lt;ref&gt;The Walter Reed Tropical Medicine Course (Lab Manual); Fourth edition (2011); ASIN: B0070AOM4S&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:WalterReed.jpeg|thumb|''The course in named in honor of [[Walter Reed]]'']]
Over the next fifty years, the course changed names and length but remained dedicated to teaching continuing [[tropical medicine]] education to [[military officers]]. In 1954, the Institute began the “Advanced Military [[Preventive medicine|Preventive Medicine]] Course” which carried on the tropical medicine education tradition begun in 1941. This course was eventually supplanted by the “Global Medicine Course” in December 1966. During the next four and a half years, the Global Medicine course was offered on 8 separate occasions. This 12-week course was divided into 4 weeks of “Epidemiology and Applied Biostatistics”, 3 weeks of “Ecology and Disease”, and 5 weeks of “Tropical Medicine”. In February 1972, the Global Medicine course was split into a 5-week course called “Military Medical Ecology” and a 6-week course called the “Tropical Medicine Course”. The first Tropical Medicine Course was offered in July and August 1972 and was attended by 11 medical officers and 4 clinical clerks. The course endured until 1993 and was the only surviving remnant of the original [[Army Medical School]] educational offerings.&lt;ref&gt;The Walter Reed Tropical Medicine Course (Lab Manual); Fourth edition (2011); ASIN: B0070AOM4S&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the Institute celebrated its 50-year tradition of tropical medicine education. In memory of his significant contributions to tropical medicine education, the Institute established “The Colonel [[George W. Hunter III]] Certificate”. This award was to be presented yearly to no more than two course lecturers who embody excellence and longevity as senior lecturers in the course. The first two recipients of the award were Dr. [[Jay P. Sanford]] (former University President and Dean of the Medical School at the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]]) and [[Theodore Woodward|Dr. Theodore E. Woodward]] (Emeritus Professor of Medicine at the [[University of Maryland School of Medicine|University Of Maryland School of Medicine]]). A special presentation of this award was made to Colonel [[Richard N. Miller]], former Tropical Medicine Course Director, for his significant contributions to this course and its organization over the previous 12 years. Due to the frequency of the course changing from once a year to once a quarter, the presentation frequency of the Hunter Certificate was changed to no more than 4 per year (one per course iteration).  The 50 year celebration also was particularly honored by the commencement address given by [[Theodore Woodward|Dr. Theodore E. Woodward]] who attended the first course in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;The Walter Reed Tropical Medicine Course (Lab Manual); Fourth edition (2011); ASIN: B0070AOM4S&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to operational needs of the [[United States Special Operations Command|Special Operations Command]] and the newly formed [[Africa Command]], in 2010 it was decided to resurrect the former 6 week course at [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research|WRAIR]] and convert it to a targeted short course that would provide a broader spectrum of individuals with the knowledge they need to combat international infectious disease threats. Operational demands upon the [[U.S. military]] facing wars on multiple fronts in areas affected with tropical disease identified a vital need for an intensely focused short course to familiarize medical personnel at all educational levels in tropical medicine.&lt;ref&gt;The Walter Reed Tropical Medicine Course (Lab Manual); Fourth edition (2011); ASIN: B0070AOM4S&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coldren|first1=RL|last2=Brett-Major|first2=DM|last3=Hickey|first3=PW|last4=Garges|first4=E|last5=Weina|first5=PJ|last6=Corrigan|first6=P|last7=Quinnan|first7=G|title=Tropical medicine training in the Department of Defense.|journal=Military Medicine|date=April 2011|volume=177|issue=4|pages=361–363|pmid=22594123|url=http://publications.amsus.org/doi/pdf/10.7205/MILMED-D-11-00288|doi=10.7205/milmed-d-11-00288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the Walter Reed Tropical Medicine Course was renamed 'Operational Clinical Infectious Disease' (OCID) Course.
