The '''Katsuyama killing incident in 1945''' was a killing of three [[Military history of African Americans|African American]] [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] by [[Ryukyuans|Okinawans]] from the Katsuyama village near [[Nago, Okinawa]], after the [[Battle of Okinawa]], shortly before the end of the war in the Pacific. Many years later some of the villagers confessed that every weekend three black United States Marines had allegedly been visiting the village around that time and every time they violently took the village women into the hills with them and raped them. When the Marines started to confidently carry out their weekly ritual unarmed, the villagers reportedly overwhelmed the men one time and killed all three. Their bodies were hidden in the nearby cave out of fear for retaliation against the village, a village secret until 1997.&lt;ref name="Sims p."&gt;{{harvnb|Sims|2000|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the killings, the cave has been known as 'Kuronbō Gama,' by locals&lt;ref name="Talmadge"&gt;[http://onlineathens.com/stories/050700/new_0507000024.shtml#.VSLbG_mUfQg Okinawa legend leaves unsettling questions about Marines' deaths], ''Locals call it ''Kuronbō Gama.' ''&lt;/ref&gt; which translates to the "Cave of The Dark Skinned Boys". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.japandict.com/黒ん坊 Kuronbō is an ethnic slur combining two words referring to a "dark skinned" or "very tanned person" and the word "boy".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==

Villagers revealed long after the attack that the Marines were so confident that the villagers were powerless that they came to the village without weapons.&lt;ref name="Cullen p."&gt;{{harvnb|Cullen|2001|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking advantage of this, the villagers ambushed them with the help of two armed Japanese soldiers who were hiding in the nearby jungle.&lt;ref name="Cullen p."/&gt; Shinsei Higa, who was sixteen at the time, remembers that "I didn't see the actual killing because I was hiding in the mountains above, but I heard five or six gunshots and then a lot of footsteps and commotion. By late afternoon, we came down from the mountains and then everyone knew what had happened."&lt;ref name="Sims p."/&gt;

To cover up the deaths, the bodies were dumped in a local cave that had a 50-foot (15-m) drop-off close to its entrance. 

When the men did not return to their Marine Corps posts, they were listed as possible deserters in the summer of 1945. After a year with still no evidence of what happened to them, they were declared [[missing in action]].&lt;ref name="Sims p."/&gt;

==Discovery==

Kijun Kishimoto was almost thirty during the incident and grew up in Katsuyama. He was away from the village when the men were killed. In an interview, he said, "People were very afraid that if the Americans found out what happened there would be retaliation, so they decided to keep it a secret to protect those involved."&lt;ref name="Sims p."/&gt;

Finally, a guilty conscience led Kishimoto to contact {{nihongo|Setsuko Inafuku|稲福節子}}, a tour guide for [[Kadena Air Base|Kadena United States Air Base]] in Okinawa, whose deceased son Clive was also a victim of sexual assault, and who was involved in the search for deceased servicemen from the war.&lt;ref name="Sims p."/&gt; The two searched for the cave in June 1997, but could not find it until August, when a storm blew down a tree which had been blocking the entrance.&lt;ref name="Sims p."/&gt; The local Japanese police were informed but they kept it secret for a few months to protect the people who discovered the location of the bodies.

The incident was reported by Ms. Inafuku to then Kadena Air Base 18th Wing Historian MSgt James Allender, who in turn reported it to the [[Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command|Joint Services Central Identification Laboratory]] at Pearl Harbor.  Once the bodies were recovered by the Army, the men were all identified, using dental records. Their names were Pfc. James D. Robinson of Savannah, Ga., Pfc. John M. Smith of Cincinnati, and Pvt. Isaac Stokes of Chicago, all aged 19.&lt;ref name="Sims p."/&gt; The cause(s) of death could not be determined.&lt;ref name="Talmadge"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
No plans were made to criminally investigate the incident by either the United States military or the Okinawa police.&lt;ref name="Sims p."/&gt;

After the [[Battle of Okinawa]], the island chain was occupied under the [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands]] until 1972. At that time, the U.S. government returned the islands to Japanese administration. Under the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security]], the [[United States Forces Japan]] (USFJ) have maintained a large military presence: 27,000 personnel, including 15,000 Marines, contingents from the Navy, Army, and Air Force, and their 22,000 family members are stationed in Okinawa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pref.okinawa.jp/kititaisaku/GEN.pdf 沖縄県の基地の現状]{{jp icon}}, Okinawa Prefectural Government&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bangladesh Ansar mutiny''' was a [[mutiny]] staged from 1 December to 4 December 1994,&lt;ref name="fefc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2013/11/07/ISSUES_PAPER_CHRONOLOGY-OF-EVENTS-JANUARY-1994-DECEMBER-1995.pdf|title=Chronology of Events|website=justice.gov|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Shafipur]] and [[Khilgaon Thana|Khilgaon]] by a section of the [[Bangladesh Ansar]], a [[paramilitary]] force tasked with providing security to government installations and aiding law enforcement in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="ceev"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chowdhury |first1=Afsan |date=April 2009 |title=What Lies Below |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/forum/2009/april/below.htm |work=Forum |publisher=The Daily Star |accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ghug" /&gt; The mutiny prompted a series of reforms by the government.&lt;ref name="ghug" /&gt;

==Background==
Bangladesh Ansar evolved from the [[Home Guard (India)|Indian Home Guard]] in 1948, after the [[partition of India]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansarvdp.gov.bd/contentShow.php?action=showconts&amp;id=4|title=About Bangladesh Ansar &amp; VDP|website=Bangladesh Ansar &amp; VDP – Government of Bangladesh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312060541/http://www.ansarvdp.gov.bd/contentShow.php?action=showconts&amp;id=4 |archive-date=12 March 2016 |access-date=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1948 to 1972, it was under the National Service Board. In 1973, it was placed under the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Bangladesh)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] and an Ansar cadre was formed in the [[Bangladesh Civil Service]]. Together with its sister organization [[Village Defence Party]], it has over 4 million members including reserves.&lt;ref name="ghug"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nabi|first1=Khondaker Md Nur Un|title=Ansar and Village Defence Party|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Ansar_and_Village_Defence_Party|website=en.banglapedia.org|publisher=Banglapedia|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The Bangladesh Ansar mutinied in the [[Ansar-VDP Academy|Ansar Academy]] in [[Shafipur]], and [[Khilgaon Thana|Khilgaon]] on 1 December 1994, demanding higher pay, job security and better treatment from officers.&lt;ref name="fefc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Economist Intelligence Unit |date=1995 |title=Country Report: Bangladesh |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8MgbAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ansar+mutiny+1994.&amp;dq=Ansar+mutiny+1994.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUts6pgu7QAhVE7CYKHURbDokQ6AEIMjAE |publisher=The Unit |accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mutiny was ended on 4 December 1994, when a [[military operation]] was launched by [[Border Guards Bangladesh|Bangladesh Rifles]], supported by the [[Bangladesh Police]] and helicopters from [[Bangladesh Air Force]].&lt;ref name="fefc" /&gt; Official estimates place the death toll at 1 or 2 and 12-40 Ansar personnel were injured.&lt;ref name="fefc" /&gt; Independent estimates place 30 mutineers among the casualty.&lt;ref name="ceev" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgb.gov.bd/index.php/bgb/page/46_border_guard_bn/86|title=Border Guard Bangladesh|website=bgb.gov.bd|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Journalist and [[Social criticism|social critic]], [[Farhad Mazhar]], called the mutiny inevitable because of the social discrimination faced by members of Bangladesh Ansar. He was jailed for his views on the mutiny.&lt;ref name="ceev" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=January 1998 |title=Farhad Mazhar:Left for what? |url=http://old.himalmag.com/component/content/article/2403-farhad-mazharleft-for-what.html |magazine=Himal |accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reform ===
In response to the agitations, the government passed a series of acts in the [[Jatiya Sangsad]]. These include Ansar Bahini Act (1995), Battalion Ansar Act (1995) and the Village Defence Party Act (1995).&lt;ref name="ghug" /&gt; Under these Acts, the Ansar Bahini and the Battalion Ansars were declared a "Disciplined Force" in accordance with article 152 of the [[Constitution of Bangladesh|Constitution]].&lt;ref name="ghug" /&gt; The governemnet set up Ansar VDP Bank where the members of Ansar-VDP were decided to be the shareholders. The bank also provides soft loans to Ansar members.&lt;ref name="ghug" /&gt;

'''Active 20-30 International''' is an international service club focused on helping children and developing leadership skills in younger adults ages 20–39. In the United States and Canada the organization is called the Active 20-30 Club and has over 50 local chapters. In Latin America the group is called Activo 20-30 Internacional and has over 60 chapters. The Active 20-30 Club is also a member of a global group called the WOCO  Foundation.

== History ==
Active 20-30 International is the result of the fusion of two Clubs, Active International and 20-30 International. Both were created to give younger adults the opportunity to lead, as leadership positions in established service clubs at that time were dominated by older men.

===Active International===
Active International was founded in [[Aberdeen, Washington]] February 10, 1922, as  The Active Club. A group of young men including Ernest Axland, Paul Arthand, Carl Morck, Carl Springer, Carl Teman, Edgar Jones and Pat McNamara were eager to give the young men a more active part in the affairs of the community. Thus, they formed together to establish a young men's club which they named "Active".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Traditions|url=http://www.active20-30.com/history-traditions|work=Active 20-30 International|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{USCongRec|1968|3192|date=February 15, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active was incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington on August 20, 1924. Before long, Active Clubs were formed in Elma, Hoquiam, Montesano and Olympia.

In 1925 the first convention was held in [[Montesano, Washington]], with Carl Morck of Aberdeen being elected as president. In the same year, the name of the organization was officially changed from Active Club to Active Club International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Colgate |first=Craig |year=1981 |title=National Recreational, Sporting, and Hobby Organizations of the United States |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hSKCAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22active+international%22+montesano&amp;dq=%22active+international%22+montesano |location= |publisher=Columbia Books |isbn= |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Offices of Active International have been located in Aberdeen, Tacoma, Raymond and Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=California. Legislature. Assembly. |first= |year=1968 |title=Journal of the Assembly, Legislature of the State of California |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/journal-of-the-assembly-legislature-of-the-state-of-california/oclc/6622899 |location= |publisher=California |isbn= |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20-30 International===
20-30 International was founded in [[Sacramento, CA]] in the fall of 1922. Paul W. Claiborne was just twenty years of age when he conceived the idea of forming a service club whose members would consist of young men. Together with Earl B. Casey, Alfred B. Franke, Charles G. McBride and Marshall A. Page, he went with his idea to Mitch Nathan, the president of the Sacramento Chamber of Commerce. Nathan approved of his plan and appointed a committee to foster the formation of a club whose activities would aid the growth and advancement of young men. This committee consisted of F.A.S. "Sandy" Foale, Chairman; Charles Hansen, Clinton Harbor, Joseph Quire and Mrs. Alva Archer. A meeting was held in the Chamber of Commerce building on Tuesday, December 12, 1922, with Judge Peter J. Shields as the speaker. It was decided to proceed with the organization work immediately. Upon the suggestion of Sandy Foale, the name 20-30 was adopted.&lt;ref name="TTMag1926"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cain |first=Ed |year=1926 |title=The Twenty-Thirtian Magazine, 1926 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gvH-lt6hA1oC&amp;pg=PP5&amp;dq=sumner+20-30+club#v=onepage&amp;q=sumner%2020-30%20club&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |isbn= |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boone"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boone |first=Andrew |date=August 1929 |title=Rotary's Younger Brother: An Active Organization of "Junior Rotarians" |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jUMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=active+20-30+club#v=onepage&amp;q=active%2020-30%20club&amp;f=false |journal=The Rotarian |accessdate=November 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organizational meeting was held on December 19, 1922, and Paul Claiborne was unanimously elected as the first president. Sandy Foale was named chairman of the advisory board. After the Sacramento club had established itself, 20-30 began to expand to new areas.&lt;ref name="TTMag1926"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boone"/&gt;

On March 10, 1924, the [[Stockton, CA]] club was chartered with the assistance of the Rotary Club in Stockton.  G. Lewis Fox was elected president, and Dr. Hall was named Chairman of the Advisory Board. A meeting between Sacramento and Stockton was held on March 5, 1925, and they created the 20-30 Club Executive Council to help with expansion to other cities. In August 1925, the third Club, [[San Bernardino, California]], becomes affiliated with the organization.&lt;ref name="TTMag1926"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boone"/&gt;

During 1926, 20-30 Clubs were formed in San Francisco, Hayward, Tracy and Oakland. Delegates from the seven clubs met in San Francisco on August 21, 1926. This was the first convention of 20-30. A Constitution was adopted and the following officers were elected: Sumner Mering, President; Tom Louttit, Vice President; Ivan Shoemaker, Secretary/Treasurer.&lt;ref name="TTMag1926"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boone"/&gt;

===Expansion of the Active &amp; 20-30 Organizations===
In June 1929, Active International became international in fact, as well as in name, with the chartering of the Vancouver International Club in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Active clubs soon spread through [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[California]] and [[Montana]] in the United States and the provinces of [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]] in [[Canada]]. Clubs were also located in [[Idaho]], [[Hawaii]] and [[Washington D.C.]]

From 20-30's inception in 1922 until December 1941, charters were granted to 260 clubs and a total membership of 4,675 was attained. During the war years, approximately 65 percent of the membership served in the armed forces. This compelled 68 clubs to disband and decreased the number of active clubs to 122 with active membership at 1,800. In many cases the clubs were kept on active status by one or two members who maintained the charter.&lt;ref name="Boone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=20-30 Club Is Lauded For Work |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=897&amp;dat=19460629&amp;id=LPIKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EFADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4373,3158383 |newspaper=Prescott Evening Courier |location=Prescott, AZ |publisher= |date=June 29, 1946 |accessdate=November 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official start of international expansion started is up for debate. It was widely believed that with the chartering of the Juarez Club on February 16, 1944, so started the movement of 20-30 in Mexico and Latin America. However, new evidence points to the first real international presence beginning in 1933 when the [[El Paso, Texas]], club was chartered and possibly the [[Juarez, Mexico]] Club as well. It was a result of the Juarez charter and that of other Mexican clubs that the name of the association was changed to 20-30 International at the 1946 Victory Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cain |first=Ed |year=1933 |title=The Twenty-Thirtian Magazine, 1933 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lfgFQ41qefoC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=juarez+20-30+club#v=onepage&amp;q=juarez%2020-30%20club&amp;f=falsee |location= |publisher= |isbn= |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 20-30 International Convention held in [[Santa Cruz, CA]] in 1960,&lt;ref name="santacruzmah"&gt;{{cite web|title=Twenty-Thirtian |url=http://www.santacruzmah.org/2011/twenty-thirtian/ |work=Santa Cruz Museum of Art &amp; History at the McPherson Center |accessdate=23 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002034/http://www.santacruzmah.org/2011/twenty-thirtian/ |archivedate=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the delegates unanimously adopted the merger proposal and the Constitution. One month later, the delegates at the Active international Convention in [[Calgary, Alberta]], also unanimously adopted the propositions. Therefore, on August 1, 1960, Active International and 20-30 International became Active 20-30 International.&lt;ref name="santacruzmah"/&gt;

The first convention of Active 20-30 International was held in Tucson, AZ, July 10–14, 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Journal of Arizona History |year=1961 |volume= 2|page=41 |title=20-30 Club Convention |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0ooRAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=tucson+20-30+club+convention&amp;dq=tucson+20-30+club+convention|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where the Constitution and By-Laws were officially adopted. Jack Kummert was elected President; Federico G. Lugo as First Vice-President; James Robertson as Second Vice-President.  Clint McClure and Owen Barnes, the last presidents of 20-30 and Active respectively, stayed as members of the International Directors Council as Immediate Past Presidents.

Other members of the First Council of Directors of Active 20-30 International were: Ray Manges, Area 1; Norm Jensen, Area 2; Skeet Glidewell, Area 3; Forrest K. Stewart, Area 4; Roy Stype, Area 5; Emilio Pérez-Banuet, Area 6; Joaquin Bours, Associate Director of Area 6; Angel Moreno, Area 7 and Bob Baumgartner, Area 8.

Its presence became so large, that the [[State of California]] and Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] declared February 20–26, 1967 "Active 20-30 Week" &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Active 20-30 International==

=== Philosophy ===
The original Active International and 20-30 International clubs started as a result of younger members of other service organizations finding that most leadership positions in those organizations were held and reserved for, the older and more senior members. The idea of a time limit for membership was intended to help build leadership and responsibility. The club as a whole focuses on helping children, specifically those that have special needs or are disadvantaged. Local clubs apply that focus to their specific cities and towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kalb |first=Loretta |title=Neighbors rally to make the most of new Carmichael park |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2011/09/16/3914482/neighbors-rally-to-make-the-most.html |accessdate=21 November 2013 |newspaper=Sacramento Bee |date=Sep 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202225015/http://www.sacbee.com/2011/09/16/3914482/neighbors-rally-to-make-the-most.html |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fredriksen|first=Justine|title=New service club tends to school's garden|url=http://www.freenewspos.com/news/article/a/704511/club%20over/new-service-club-tends-to-school-39-s-garden|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=Ukiah Daily Journal|date=August 27, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131121030808/http://www.freenewspos.com/news/article/a/704511/club%20over/new-service-club-tends-to-school-39-s-garden|archive-date=2013-11-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Battle of Brews to benefit Challenger Little League|url=http://beer.blogs.pressdemocrat.com/967/battle-of-brews-to-benefit-challenger-little-league/|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=The Press Democrat|date=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Snyder|first=George|title=Tee Off for Teens In Golf Classic|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Tee-Off-for-Teens-In-Golf-Classic-3005231.php|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=May 29, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbols and Sayings of The Organization===
The symbols and sayings of the organization are typically adaptations of those of Active International and 20-30 International or a confluence of both.

====Emblem====
The Active 20-30 International emblem is a buzz saw encircling an hourglass and inscribed "Active 20-30 International."

The emblem selected for Active International was the buzz saw. The buzz saw is just about the most active object you can find anywhere. Even when motionless, as it is on the emblem, it has the appearance of intense activity. Since Aberdeen was a lumber center and sawmills with humming saw blades were in evidence everywhere, it was only logical that the founders of Active chose the buzz saw for their emblem. The buzz saw represents the usefulness of intense activity and the abundant energy of responsible youth, means power, strength, and progress.&lt;ref name="Durrance"/&gt;

The emblem of 20-30 International was an hourglass, symbolizing the passage of time and the need of young man to take advantage of his time and energy for useful activities.  Around this hourglass, there were four "S". The four "S" have a double significance since these were the initials of the first four 20-30 Clubs (Sacramento, Stockton, San Bernardino and San Francisco) and they also form the initials of the original slogan "Sincerity in Service, our Slogan for Success".&lt;ref name="Durrance"/&gt;

Upon the merger, a new emblem was developed incorporating both. The 4 "S" were removed and the hourglass was placed within a 23 tooth buzzsaw.

====Mission Statement====
The mission statement is "Providing young adults with an opportunity for personal growth, friendship and leadership development while improving the quality of life for the special needs children in our community."

====Club Motto====
The club's motto is "Youth, to be served, must serve" and variations on the club slogan include "One never stands so tall as when kneeling to help a child," "A man never stands so tall as when he kneels to help a child," "Man never stands so tall as when kneeling to help a child," and "A person never stands so tall as when kneeling to help a child."

====Colors====
The club's colors are red, blue, and gold.

=== Membership ===
Local clubs include women's chapters, men's chapters, and co-ed chapters. The age requirement to be a member is 20-39 to allow for youth leadership training. Honorary members can be of any age. Many Active 20-30 Clubs partner with other service clubs, such as Kiwanis, Rotary, Lions Club, and Soroptimist, and Active 20-30 Club members often join these groups later on in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=International|first=Rotary|title=Proceedings: Twenty-Fourth Annual Convention of Rotary International|year=1933|page=320|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FbpVFscCbEYC&amp;pg=PA320&amp;dq=20-30+club#v=onepage&amp;q=20-30%20club&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chuey|first=Tim|title=Who Are The Lions And What Do They Do?|url=http://eugenedailynews.com/2013/11/lions/|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=Eugene Daily News|date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bishuo language''' is an extinct or nearly extinct [[Furu languages|Furu language]] of [[Cameroon]]. It was spoken in the [[North West Province]], [[Menchum|Menchum Department]], Furu-Awa Subdivision, Ntjieka, Furu-Turuwa and the Furu-Sambari villages. It was related to [[Bikya language]].  It was reported by Breton 1986 that the [[Bishuo people]] had shifted to [[Jukun Takum language|Jukun]], with apparently only one remaining person, over 60 years old, who knew any Bishuo.

[[Paul Sidwell]] (2014)&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2014. "[https://www.academia.edu/11935141/Khmuic_classification_and_homeland Khmuic classification and homeland]". ''Mon-Khmer Studies'' 43.1:47-56&lt;/ref&gt; and Svantesson (1990) classify Bit as [[Palaungic languages|Palaungic]]. It is most closely related to [[Kháng language|Kháng]] and [[Quang Lam language|Quang Lam]].

==Distribution==

Tokyo: Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa (ILCAA).&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In [[Mengla County]], Yunnan, China, Bit (Buxing) is spoken by 539 people as of 2000, in the following villages (Gao 2004).

*Nanqian 南欠村, Manzhuang Village 曼庄村, Mohan Township 磨憨镇&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=160513&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Menghai County]], Yunnan, China, there is a group of people known as the Bajia 八甲人 of Menghun 勐混 (not to be confused with the Tai-speaking Bajia of Meng'a Township 勐阿镇, [[Menghai County]]), which is close to the border with [[Shan State]], Myanmar (Zhou 2013). They live in Manbi Village 曼必村,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=157200&lt;/ref&gt; Menghun Town 勐混镇, [[Menghai County]], Yunnan (comprising 48 households and 217 persons), and have recently been classified by the Chinese government as ethnic [[Bulang people]].&lt;ref name="zhang2013"&gt;Zhang Yanju 张艳菊. 2013.

The Bajia of Menghun believe that their ancestors had migrated from Laos. They are variously referred to by other ethnic groups as Kabi 卡必, Laos Bulang 老挝布朗, and Manbi people 曼必人. They do not consider themselves to be Bajia 八甲人, which is a name given to them by government officials, since they do not believe they are related to the Tai-speaking Bajia of Meng'a. Yunnan (1979)&lt;ref name="Yunnan1979"/&gt; considers Bajia 八甲 to be a dialect of [[Tai Lue language|Tai Lue]] based on the group's autonym and language, with 225 Bajia people counted as of 1960. The Bajia had originally migrated from Bajia 八甲, Laojian Mountain 老肩山, [[Jinggu County]].&lt;ref name="Yunnan1979"/&gt; Yunnan (1979) documents the location of Bajia as Jingbo Township 景播乡,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=105164 勐海县勐阿镇贺建村民委员会景播老寨村]&lt;/ref&gt; Meng'a District 勐阿区, [[Menghai County]].

Kunming: Yunnan minzuxue yanjiu suoyin 云南民族学研究所印.&lt;/ref&gt; reports that in Mengla County, the Khabit (Kabie 卡别) have close relations with a group called the ''Bubeng 布崩'', who numbered 15 households with about 100 people as of 1960, and speak a [[Hani languages|Hani]] language. Yunnan (1979) classifies both the Kabie 卡别 and Bubeng 布崩 as ethnic [[Hani people]].

'''[[Capital punishment]]''' is a legal penalty in '''[[Singapore]]'''. The city-state had the second highest per-capita execution rate in the world between 1994 and 1998, estimated by the [[United Nations]] to be 13.83 executions annually per one million people during that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/pdf/crime/10_commission/10e.pdf para 68 UNODC.org (page 18)]&lt;/ref&gt; The highest was [[Turkmenistan]] (now an abolitionist country) with 14.92. However, since the 2010s, execution has become far less common, with some years having no executions at all. No one was executed in 2012 and 2013, and two persons were executed in 2014. Nevertheless, in recent years, executions have started to surge again: in 2018, so far, 9 people were executed, the highest yearly number of the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Singapore&lt;/ref&gt;

Each execution in [[Singapore]] is carried out by [[Hanging#Long drop|long drop hanging]] in [[Changi Prison]] at dawn on Friday, except once on 20 May 2016 when the execution of Kho Jabing was carried out at 3:30&amp;nbsp;pm after his appeal for a stay of execution was dismissed that morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/blog/2016/05/20/kho-jabing-executed-at-3-30pm-first-execution-in-singapore-not-carried-out-at-dawn-of-friday/|title=Kho Jabing executed at 3.30pm, first execution in Singapore not carried out at dawn of Friday|publisher=The Online Citizen|date=9 August 2016|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey done in 2005, reported in ''[[The Straits Times]]'', 95% of Singaporeans believe that their country should retain the death penalty.&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;Ho, Peng Kee, ''Singapore Parliamentary Reports'', 11th Parliament, Session 1, Volume 83, 23 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore has had [[capital punishment]] since it was a British colony and became independent before the [[United Kingdom]] abolished capital punishment. The Singaporean procedure of hanging condemned individuals is similar to the methods formerly used in the United Kingdom.

In 2012, however, Singapore amended its laws to exempt some cases from the mandatory death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chen |first=Sharon |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-14/singapore-amends-death-penalty-law-to-exempt-some-offences-1-.html |title=Singapore Amends Death Penalty Law to Exempt Some Offences |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2012-11-14 |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
The following table of executions was compiled by [[Amnesty International]] from several sources, including statistics supplied by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] in January 2001 and government figures reported to ''[[Agence France-Presse]]'' in September 2003.&lt;ref name="Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions"&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = Amnesty International recognizes the need to combat drug trafficking, and the harm that illicit drugs can cause. However there is no convincing evidence that the death penalty deters would-be traffickers more effectively than other punishments; Amnesty International is gravely concerned that such presumptions erode the right to a fair trial, increasing the risk that an innocent person may be executed, particularly as the law provides for a mandatory death sentence; Amnesty International opposes the death penalty worldwide in all cases without exception; Relatives have informed Amnesty International that prisoners under sentence of death are kept in strict isolation in individual cells measuring approximately three square meters. The cells are thought to have walls on three sides, with bars on the remaining side. Cells are sparse, furnished only with a toilet and a mat for sleeping, but no bedding. Inmates are allowed the use of a bucket for washing; They may receive one 20-minute visit per week in a special area where they are separated from visitors by a thick pane of glass and have to communicate via a telephone. About four days before the execution date, as a special concession, prisoners are permitted to watch television or listen to the radio and are given meals of their choice, within the prison’s budget. They are also allowed extra visits from relatives but no physical contact is permitted at any time before the execution; In July 2001 then parliamentarian and prominent human rights campaigner, J.B. Jeyaretnam, called for a parliamentary debate about the case of a drug user who was facing execution, urging the Cabinet to consider various aspects of the case during examination of his clemency appeal. J.B. Jeyaretnam was given just a few minutes to speak before his arguments were rebutted by the Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs.

Detailed statistics were not released by the [[government of Singapore|Singapore government]] between 2000 and 2006. Singapore's [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Goh Chok Tong]] told the [[BBC]] in September 2003 that he believed there were "in the region of about 70 to 80" hangings in 2003. Two days later he retracted his statement, saying the number was in fact ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/24/1064083055829.html|title=More people executed in Singapore|date=25 September 2003|accessdate=2007-12-30|agency=AFP | location=Melbourne | work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief executioner, [[Darshan Singh (executioner)|Darshan Singh]], said that he has executed more than 850 people during his service from 1959 using the phrase: "I am going to send you to a better place than this. God bless you." This included 18 people on one day, using three ropes at a time. Singh also said that he has hanged seven people within 90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | quote = Mr Singh joined the British colonial prison service in the mid-1950s after arriving from Malaysia. When the long-established British hangman Mr Seymour retired, Singh, then 27, volunteered for the job. He was attracted by the bonus payment for executions. Mr Singh is credited with being the only executioner in the world to single-handedly hang 18 men in one day -- three at a time. They had been convicted of murdering four prison officers during a riot on the penal island of Pulau Senang in 1963. He also hanged seven condemned men within 90 minutes a few years later. They had been convicted in what became known as the "gold bars murders", in which a merchant and two employees were killed during a robbery. One of the most controversial executions in his career was the 1991 hanging of a young Filipina maid, Flor Contemplacion, who was convicted of the murder of a co-worker, Delia Maga, and her four-year-old son, on what many believed was shaky evidence. He carries out the executions wearing simple casual clothes, often just a T-shirt, shorts, sports shoes and knee-length socks. To mark his 500th hanging four years ago, four of his former colleagues turned up at his home to celebrate the event with a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. Mr Singh boasts that he has never botched an execution. "Mr Seymour taught him just how long the drop should be according to weight and height and exactly where the knot should be placed at the back of the neck," his colleague said. "Death has always come instantaneously and painlessly. In that split second, at precisely 6am, it's all over."

===Foreign nationals===
The people on death row include foreign nationals, many of whom were convicted of drug-related offences. These inmates come from a diverse range of countries, including the United States, Australia, Bangladesh, China, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Portugal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam. Figures released by the Singapore government show that between 1993 and 2003, 36% of those executed were foreigners, including some residents in Singapore (half of Singapore residents are foreigners).&lt;ref name="The Singapore Government's Response To Amnesty International's Report"&gt;{{cite web

 |quote=Contrary to AI's claims, Singaporeans, not foreigners, were the majority of those executed in Singapore. From 1993 to 2003, 64% of those executed were Singaporeans. In the last five years, 73% executed were Singaporeans. Given that one in four residents in Singapore is a foreigner, it is not only false but mischievous to allege that a significant proportion of prisoners executed were foreigners; Although family members are not with the inmate at the moment of execution, they are informed four days before the executions (for foreigners, the families and embassy will be informed earlier, usually seven to fourteen days) and allowed daily visits lasting up to four hours for each visit during these four days. The execution is carried out in the presence of a Prison medical doctor. Upon request, a priest or a religious minister is allowed to be present, to pray for the person to be executed; Our prison conditions are spartan but adequate. Visiting Justices, who are prominent members of the community, conduct regular unannounced visits to the prison institutions to make sure that prisoners, including those on death row, are not ill-treated. It is not true that prisoners are not allowed to exercise. All prisoners, including condemned prisoners, are entitled to their daily exercises. In fact, there are two exercise yards dedicated for this use. They are normally allowed to exercise twice a day, half an hour each time, one or two at a time.

==Legislation==
Under Section 316 of the [[Criminal law of Singapore#Criminal procedure|Criminal Procedure Code]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation | cap = 68 | ed = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"When any person is sentenced to death, the sentence shall direct that he shall be hanged by the neck till he is dead but shall not state the place where nor the time when the sentence is to be carried out."
Hangings always take place at dawn on Friday and are by the [[Hanging#Long drop|long drop method]] developed in the United Kingdom by [[William Marwood]]. The executioner refers to the [[Official Table of Drops]]. The government have said that they:
:"…had previously studied the different methods of execution and found no reason to change from the current method used, that is, by hanging."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2005/11/21/1513132.htm|title=Singapore stands by hanging|date=21 November 2005|accessdate=2007-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither persons under the age of 18 at the time of their offence nor pregnant women can be sentenced to death.

Capital cases are heard by a single judge in the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]]. After conviction and sentencing, the sentenced has one appeal to the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]]. If the appeal fails, the final recourse rests with the [[President of Singapore|President]], who has the power to grant clemency on the advice of the [[Cabinet of Singapore|Cabinet]]. In exceptional cases since 2012, the Court of Appeal would be asked to review its previous decisions in concluded criminal appeals where it was necessary to correct a miscarriage of justice, most of which involved drug cases attracting death penalty. The exact number of successful appeals is unknown. In November 1995, one Poh Kay Keong had his conviction overturned after the court found his statement to a [[Central Narcotics Bureau]] officer was made under duress.&lt;ref name="Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions"/&gt; Successful clemency applications are thought to be even rarer. Since 1965, the President's clemency has been granted six times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = 19 murders in first 11 months of 2006, one more than same period in 2005 | publisher = Channel NewsAsia |date=29 December 2006 | author = Rita Zahara | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/249756/1/.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last clemency was in May 1998 when Mathavakannan Kalimuthu received pardon from President [[Ong Teng Cheong]] with the sentence commuted to [[life imprisonment]].

In November 2012, capital punishment laws in Singapore were revised such that the mandatory death penalty for those convicted of drug trafficking or murder was lifted under certain specific conditions. Judges were empowered with the discretion to sentence such offenders to life imprisonment, which suggests the prisoner lives his entire natural life in jail with the possibility of [[appeal]] after 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abu Baker|first1=Jalelah|title=Murderer fails to escape the gallows: 6 other cases involving the revised death penalty laws|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/murderer-fails-to-escape-the-gallows-6-other-cases-involving-the-revised|accessdate=22 February 2016|publisher=Straits Times|date=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The condemned are given notice at least four days before execution. In the case of foreigners who have been sentenced to death, their families and diplomatic missions/embassies are given one to two weeks' notice.&lt;ref name="The Singapore Government's Response To Amnesty International's Report"/&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] reports that death row inmates are housed in cells of roughly three square metres (32 square feet).&lt;ref name="Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions"/&gt; Walls make up three sides, while the fourth is vertical bars. They are equipped with a toilet, a sleeping mat, and a bucket for washing. Exercise is permitted twice a day for half an hour at a time.&lt;ref name="The Singapore Government's Response To Amnesty International's Report"/&gt; Four days before the execution, the condemned is allowed to watch television or listen to the radio.&lt;ref name="Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions"/&gt;
Special meals of their choice are also cooked, if within the prison budget. Visiting rights are increased from one 20 minute visit per week to a maximum of four hours each day,&lt;ref name="The Singapore Government's Response To Amnesty International's Report"/&gt; though no physical contact is allowed with any visitors.&lt;ref name="Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions"/&gt;

==Capital offences==
In addition to the Penal Code, there are four [[Act of Parliament#Singapore|Acts of Parliament]] that prescribe death as punishment for offences. According to a Singaporean [[civil rights]] group, the Think Centre, 70% of hangings are for drug-related offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=1425|title=Singapore Death Penalty Shrouded In Silence|publisher=Reuters|date=12 April 2002|accessdate=2007-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, all 8 hangings were for drug offences that year.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

===Penal Code===
Under the Penal Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation | cap = 224 | ed = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; the commission of the following offences may result in the death penalty:
*Waging or attempting to wage war or abetting the waging of war against the [[Government of Singapore|government]] ((§121)
*Offences against the [[President of Singapore|president]]'s person (in other words, [[treason]]) ((§121A)
*[[Piracy]] that endangers life (§130B)
*[[Genocide]] (§130E)
*Abetting of [[mutiny]] (§132)
*[[Perjury]] that results in the execution of an innocent person (§194)
*[[Murder]] (§302)
*Abetting the suicide of a person under the age of 18 or an "insane" person (§305)
*Attempted murder by a prisoner serving a life sentence (§307 (2))
*[[Kidnapping]] in order to commit murder (§364)
*Robbery committed by five or more people that results in the death of a person ((§396)

Since the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Singapore Statutes Online - Results|url = http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=Id%253Ac2ed2ae6-c106-4435-a7be-b4f1300c71c1%2520Depth%253A0%2520Status%253Apublished%2520Published%253A28%252F01%252F2008;rec=0;resUrl=http%253A%252F%252Fstatutes.agc.gov.sg%252Faol%252Fsearch%252Fsummary%252Fresults.w3p%253Bpage%253D0%253Bquery%253DId%25253Ac2ed2ae6-c106-4435-a7be-b4f1300c71c1%252520Depth%25253A0%252520Status%25253Apublished%252520Published%25253A28%25252F01%25252F2008|website = statutes.agc.gov.sg|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore no longer allows for the death penalty for rape nor mutiny.

=== Arms Offences Act ===
The Arms Offences Act under Singapore law regulates criminal offences dealing with firearms and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation | cap = 14 | ed = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any person who uses or attempts to use arms (Section 4) can face execution, as well as any person who uses or attempts to use arms to commit scheduled offences (Section 4A). These scheduled offences are being a member of an unlawful assembly; rioting; certain offences against the person; abduction or kidnapping; extortion; burglary; robbery; preventing or resisting arrest; vandalism; mischief. Any person who is an accomplice (Section 5) to a person convicted of arms use during a scheduled offence can likewise be executed.

Trafficking in arms (Section 6) is a capital offence in Singapore. Under the Arms Offences Act, trafficking is defined as being in unlawful possession of more than two firearms.

===Misuse of Drugs Act===
[[File:SingaporeEmbarkationCard.png|thumb|The Singapore embarkation card contains a warning to visitors about the [[Capital punishment for drug trafficking|death penalty for drug trafficking]]. Warning signs can also be found at the [[Johor-Singapore Causeway]] and other border entries.]]

Under Schedule 2 of the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|Misuse of Drugs Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation | cap = 185 | ed = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=2008-REVED-185&amp;segid=1207125305-001819 SECOND SCHEDULE - OFFENCES PUNISHABLE ON CONVICTION]&lt;/ref&gt; any person importing, exporting, or found in possession of more than the following quantities of drugs receives a mandatory death sentence:

* 1200&amp;nbsp;grams of [[opium]] and containing more than 30&amp;nbsp;grams of morphine (§5 and §7, (2)(b));
* 30&amp;nbsp;grams of [[morphine]] (§5 and §7, (3)(b));
* 15&amp;nbsp;grams of [[diamorphine]] (heroin) (diamo (§5 and §7, (4)(b));
* 30&amp;nbsp;grams of [[cocaine]] (§5 and §7, (5)(b));
* 500&amp;nbsp;grams of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (§5 and §7, (6)(b));
* 1000&amp;nbsp;grams of cannabis mixture (§5 and §7, (7)(b));
* 200&amp;nbsp;grams of cannabis resin (§5 and §7, (8)(b));
* 250&amp;nbsp;grams of [[methamphetamine]] (§5 and §7, (9)(b)).

Death sentences are also mandatory for any person caught manufacturing :

*Morphine, or any salt of morphine, ester of morphine or salt of ester of morphine (§6, (2));
*Diamorphine (heroin) or any salt of diamorphine (§6, (3));
*Cocaine or any sale of cocaine (§6, (4));
*Methamphetamine (§6, (5)).

Under the Act:
:"any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control —

::(a) anything containing a controlled drug;
::(b) the keys of anything containing a controlled drug;
::(c) the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof in which a controlled drug is found; or
::(d) a document of title relating to a controlled drug or any other document intended for the delivery of a controlled drug,

:shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession."

The majority of executions in Singapore are for drug offences. Since 2010, 23 prisoners have been executed for drug offences, while only 5 have been executed for other offences, such as murder. Death penalty supporters, such as the blogger Benjamin Chang, claim that Singapore has one of the lowest prevalence of drug abuse worldwide: he claims, for instance, that over two decades, the number of drug abusers arrested each year has declined by two-thirds, from over 6,000 in the early 1990s to about 2,000 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fivestarsandamoon.com/?p=864 |title=Results on Poll: Would you support a total abolishment of the death sentence? |publisher=Five Stars And a Moon |date=2012-11-17 |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of these figures is disputed by other Singaporeans, such as the Singaporean drugs counsellor Tony Tan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drug Addiction and Rehabilitation in Draconian Singapore|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/05/23/drug-addiction-and-rehabilitation-in-draconian-singapore/|website=The Independent|accessdate=4 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016210953/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/05/23/drug-addiction-and-rehabilitation-in-draconian-singapore/|archivedate=16 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] notes that Singapore remains a transit destination for drug traffickers in Asia, drug seizures continue to increase and heroin drug use within Singapore is continuing to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore|url=http://www.apaic.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=131&amp;Itemid=139|website=The Global SMART programme|accessdate=4 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903195206/http://www.apaic.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=131&amp;Itemid=139|archive-date=3 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal Security Act===
The preamble of the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]] states that it is an Act to "provide for the internal security of Singapore, preventive detention, the prevention of subversion, the suppression of organised violence against persons and property in specified areas of Singapore, and for matters incidental thereto."&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation | cap = 143 | ed = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[President of Singapore]] has the power to designate certain security areas. Any person caught in the possession or with someone in possession of firearms, ammunition or explosives in a security area can be punished by death.

===Kidnapping Act===
The terms of the [[Kidnapping Act (Singapore)|Kidnapping Act]] designate abduction, wrongful restraint or wrongful confinement for ransom as capital offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation | cap = 151 | ed = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public debate==
Public debate in the Singaporean news media on the death penalty is almost non-existent, although the topic does occasionally get discussed in the midst of major, well-known criminal cases. Efforts to garner public opinion on the issue are rare, although it has been suggested that the population is influenced by a traditional Chinese view which held that harsh punishment deters crime and helps maintain social peace and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40319 | title=DEATH PENALTY-SINGAPORE: Stand at UN Leaves Many Angered | publisher=IPS | date=3 December 2007 | author=Baradan Kuppusamy | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211204525/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40319 | archivedate=11 December 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs [[Ho Peng Kee]] said in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] that "Certain of us may hold the view that the death penalty should be abolished. But in a survey done two years ago, reported in ''[[The Straits Times]]'', 95% of Singaporeans feel that the death penalty should stay. This is something which has helped us to be safe and secure all these years and it is only reserved for a very few select offences." &lt;ref name="survey" /&gt;

[[Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam]], a former opposition [[Member of Parliament]], was reportedly only given a few minutes to speak in Parliament on the issue before his comments were rebutted by Ho Peng Kee.&lt;ref name="Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Few other opposition Members of Parliament would bring up the issue, which may be reflective of a population generally indifferent to the matter.

Before the hanging of [[Shanmugam Murugesu]], a three-hour vigil was held on 6 May 2005. The organisers of the event at the [[Furama Hotel]] said it was the first such public gathering organised solely by members of the public against the death penalty in Singapore. Murugesu had been arrested after being caught in possession of six packets containing just over 1&amp;nbsp;kilograms of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] after returning from [[Malaysia]]. He admitted knowledge of one of the packets, which contained 300 grams, but not the other five.&lt;ref name="Singapore finally finds a voice in death row protest"&gt;{{cite news

After the hanging of [[Van Tuong Nguyen]], a Vietnamese-Australian from [[Melbourne]], on 2 December 2005, Sister [[Susan Chia]], province leader of the [[Good Shepherd Sisters]] in Singapore, declared that "The death penalty is cruel, inhumane and it violates the right to life."

Singapore's death penalty laws have drawn comments in the media. For example, science fiction author [[William Gibson]], while a journalist, wrote a travel piece on Singapore that he sarcastically titled ''[[Disneyland with the Death Penalty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.04/gibson.html |title=Disneyland with the Death Penalty | work= [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=September 1993 |first=William |last=Gibson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Judge Loh completely ignored the evidence I produced in ''Once a Jolly Hangman'' even though he claimed to have read it from cover to cover.

===Law Society review===
In December 2005, the [[Law Society of Singapore|Law Society]] revealed that it has set up a committee, named ''Review Committee on Capital Punishment'', to examine capital punishment in the country. The President of the Society, [[Senior Counsel]] [[Philip Jeyaretnam]], said that the main focus of the review was on issues regarding administering the death penalty such as whether it should be mandatory. A report of the review would be submitted to the [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Ministry of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Singapore's Law Society to give death penalty a fair airing | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/187994/1/.html | date = 2006-01-13 | author = Ansley Ng | publisher = [[Today (Singapore newspaper)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 November 2006, they were invited to give its views on proposed amendments to the Penal Code to the Ministry of Home Affairs. In their report, issued on 30 March 2007, they argued against the mandatory death penalty:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The death penalty should be discretionary for the offences where the death sentence is mandatory - murder, drug trafficking, firearms offences and sedition - a position similar to that for the offence of kidnapping. There are strong arguments for changing the mandatory nature of capital punishment in Singapore. Judges should be given the discretion to impose the death penalty only where deemed appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Extract of the Council’s Report on the proposed Penal Code Amendments submitted to the Ministry of Home Affairs, March 30, 2007, [http://www.lawsociety.org.sg/feedback_pc/pdf/execSummary.aspx lawsociety.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716174918/http://www.lawsociety.org.sg/feedback_pc/pdf/execSummary.aspx |date=16 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Singapore government's response ===
The Singapore government states that the death penalty is only used in the most serious of crimes, sending, they say, a strong message to potential offenders. They point out that in 1994 and 1999 the [[United Nations General Assembly]] failed to adopt [[United Nations resolution|resolutions]] calling for a moratorium on the death penalty worldwide, as a majority of countries opposed such a move.

Singapore's Permanent Representative to the [[United Nations]] wrote a letter to the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial]], summary or arbitrary executions in 2001 which stated:
:"…the death penalty is primarily a criminal justice issue, and therefore is a question for the sovereign jurisdiction of each country […] the right to life is not the only right, and […] it is the duty of societies and governments to decide how to balance competing rights against each other."&lt;ref name="Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions"/&gt;

In January 2004, the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] issued a response to [[Amnesty International]]'s report, "Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions". It defended Singapore's policy to retain the death penalty, predicating its arguments on, amongst others, the following grounds:&lt;ref name="The Singapore Government's Response To Amnesty International's Report"/&gt;
*There is no international consensus on whether the death penalty should be abolished.
*Each country has the sovereign right to decide on its own judicial system, taking into account its own circumstances.
*The death penalty has been effective in keeping Singapore one of the safest places in the world to work and live in.
*The application of the death penalty is only reserved for "very serious crimes".

The Ministry of Home Affairs also refuted Amnesty International's claims of the majority of the executed being foreigners, and that it was "mostly the poor, least educated, and vulnerable people who are executed." The Ministry stated: "Singaporeans, and not foreigners, were the majority of those executed... Of those executed from 1993 to 2003, 95% were above 21 years of age, and 80% had received formal education. About 80% of those who had been sentenced to capital punishment had employment before their convictions".&lt;ref name="The Singapore Government's Response To Amnesty International's Report"/&gt;

Following the hanging of [[Van Tuong Nguyen]] in 2005, [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Lee Hsien Loong]] reiterated the government's position, stating that "The evil inflicted on thousands of people with drug trafficking demands that we must tackle the source by punishing the traffickers rather than trying to pick up the pieces afterwards... It's a law which is approved of by Singapore's inhabitants and which allows us to reduce the drug problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s voting on a moratorium on the death penalty in November 2007, Singapore's ambassador [[Vanu Gopala Menon]] said, "My delegation would like to remind this committee that capital punishment is not prohibited under international law. Yet it is clear that the sponsors of this draft resolution have decided that there can only be one view on capital punishment, and that only one set of choices should be respected... [the death penalty] is an important component of the administration of law and our justice system, and is imposed only for the most serious crimes and serves as a deterrent. We have proper legal safeguards in place to prevent any miscarriage of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Impact on official debate and discussion in the United States==
In 2012, a couple of American elected officials and office-seekers have suggested that Singapore's success in combating drug abuse should be examined as a model for the United States. [[Michael Bloomberg]], a former [[Mayor of New York City]], said that the United States could learn a thing or two from nations like Singapore when it came to drug trafficking, noting that "executing a handful of people saves thousands and thousands of lives."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnainfo.com/20120326/manhattan/us-could-learn-from-singapores-harsh-drug-laws-bloomberg-says Michael Bloomberg, ''DNA - Manhattan News'' March 26, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329033044/http://www.dnainfo.com/20120326/manhattan/us-could-learn-from-singapores-harsh-drug-laws-bloomberg-says |date=29 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last execution in [[New York (state)|New York]] took place in 1963. Several courts have ruled that the death penalty violates the [[New York Constitution]] (see ''[[People v. LaValle]]''). In 2007, the state of New York abolished the death penalty. 20 states, plus [[Washington D.C.]], have abolished the death penalty, with the most recent being [[Washington state]] in 2018. However, certain states, such as [[Texas]], still have similar or even higher rates of execution than Singapore.

Even when an American politician mentions capital punishment in Singapore, the application of the death penalty in the United States is limited by the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] to only aggravated murders committed by [[Competence (law)|mentally competent]] adults. For example, former presidential candidate [[Newt Gingrich]] repeated his longstanding advocacy for Singaporean methods in the United States's [[War on Drugs]] during campaign interviews and speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2011/11/29/377716/gingrich-praises-singapores-very-draconian-laws-that-mandate-executions-for-drug-possession/?mobile=nc |title=Newt Gingrich on Singapore's Drug laws (2012 interview) |access-date=11 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602152058/http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2011/11/29/377716/gingrich-praises-singapores-very-draconian-laws-that-mandate-executions-for-drug-possession/?mobile=nc |archive-date=2 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Political positions of Newt Gingrich#Drug policy|Newt Gingrich on U.S. drug policy and drug laws]]&lt;/ref&gt;) Nevertheless, the use of the death penalty for drug offences in the United States constitutes "cruel and unusual punishment", which is why it is considered unconstitutional.

In colonial- and postcolonial era, it has been a common crime but one marked with contradictions.{{efn-ua|"(Preface:)Cattle theft was a common crime in British India, and yet one marked by contradictions. While the protection of property was for many a defining feature of the modern state, colonial administrators were often loath to interfere in the negotiations by which Indians commonly arranged the return of stolen cattle. ... (p. 35) Cattle and buffaloes (which were often lumped together in official discussions of this crime) were critical to the practice of agriculture in much of north India, particularly in those areas where animal power was needed to operate wells for irrigation. British officials thus recognised early on the importance of cattle ownership as a critical adjunct of the establishment of a productive agricultural economy, and of clear, revenue-paying rights to land. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Gilmartin|first=David|year=2003|title=Cattle, crime and colonialism: Property as negotiation in north India|journal=The Indian Economic &amp; Social History Review''|volume = 40|issue=1|pages =33-56}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to David Gilmartin, the crime of cattle theft was perceived by the colonial era British officials are "potential political danger" that threatened "to corrupt the whole structure of the administration, for its pervasiveness threatened to undercut the position of the state as the protector and legal guarantor of the individual as a productive owner of revenue-producing property".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Gilmartin|first=David|year=2003|title=Cattle, crime and colonialism: Property as negotiation in north India|journal=The Indian Economic &amp; Social History Review''|volume = 40|issue=1|pages =38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contemporary times, the demand for meat has led to cattle becoming a target of mass-theft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/cattle-smuggling-dangerous-illegal-highly-profitable-trade-between-india-bangladesh-1553155 Cattle Smuggling: A Dangerous, Illegal And Highly Profitable Trade Between India And Bangladesh], Palash Ghosh, The International Business Times (02-04-2014), Quote: "(...) the illegal '''mass-theft of cattle is a huge problem''' thousands of miles away from the Chisum Trail – on the border between India and Bangladesh. Along the largely porous boundary between Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal, cattle-raids and cattle-smuggling, often conducted by criminal gangs, raise hundreds of millions of dollars annually in illicit profits. The activity is so lucrative and dangerous that it often costs the lives of the perpetrators and innocent bystanders. (...) Bimal Pramanik, an independent researcher in Kolkata, told the Monitor that Bangladesh has '''an insatiable demand for beef'''. “Bangladeshi slaughterhouses cannot source even 1 million cows from within the country. If Indian cows do not reach the Bangladeshi slaughterhouses, there will be a big crisis there,” he said, adding that he estimates three-fourths of all cows slaughtered in Bangladesh originated in India. “In this thriving trade, [herds of] cows worth 50 billion rupees are sent across to Bangladesh every year. '''It’s the sheer economics of the trade that drives the smuggling''',” Pramanik added."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harrisnytq1&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/world/asia/cow-thefts-on-the-rise-in-india.html For New Breed of Rustlers, Nothing Is Sacred], Gardiner Harris (MAY 26, 2013), The New York Times, Quote: "Cattle rustling, called 'lifting' here, is a growing scourge in New Delhi, as increasingly affluent Indians develop a taste for meat, even the flesh of cows, which are considered sacred in Hinduism.

==Mythology, rituals and texts==
Ancient myths in India such as those found in the Vedas mention cattle raiding, where it is described in terms of cosmogonic significance.&lt;ref&gt;David Gilmartin (2003), Cattle, crime and colonialism: Property as negotiation in north India, ''The Indian Economic &amp; Social History Review'', Volume 40, Issue 1, pages 35-37&lt;/ref&gt; These cow-theft myths trigger war and a cycle of retaliations such as in the story of [[Parashurama]], a warrior Brahmin avatar of Hindu god [[Vishnu]], who kills numerous Kashatriyas (warrior caste) after the theft of his father's mythical cow by the king.&lt;ref name=hiltebeitel76&gt;{{cite book|author=Alf Hiltebeitel|title=Rethinking India's Oral and Classical Epics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMFdosx0PokC&amp;pg=PA460 |year=2009 |publisher= University of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0-226-34055-5|pages= 460–462, with footnotes 76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

In the ''Ramayana'', states [[Alf Hiltebeitel]], a myth speaks of the sins of "murdering children, sages and cows" leading to war, migration of communities and social upheavel.

==History==
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Cattle looting is mentioned as a form of warfare among pastoral peoples in the history of India.{{efn-ua|"in dry arid deserts like the Thar it would have been moveable wealth that was more desirable than control over unproductive land. The looting of cattle was a form of warfare, locally addressed as dhads, involving rival Rajput groups and had been used to augment cattle wealth as well as to settle social and political disputes."&lt;ref name="Kothiyal2016"&gt;{{citation|last=Kothiyal|first=Tanuja|title=Nomadic Narratives: A History of Mobility and Identity in the Great Indian Desert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=be-7CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA109|date=14 March 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-08031-7|pages=109–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Competitive raiding a means to show prowess by youth and community solidarity in colonial era Punjab.{{efn-ua|"David Gilmartin has demonstrated that in nineteenth century Punjab cattle stealing was undertaken by young men to show their prowess. It was a practice associated with protection of clan livelihood as well as clan honour. Village headmen as well as clan chiefs along with rassagirs extended protection to networks of cattle theft," I would argue that in the Thar, the ability to carry out such thefts was closely associated with the ability to resolve disputes.&lt;ref name="Kothiyal2016"/&gt;}}{{efn-ua|"Far more important for British officials in  (p 36) the nineteenth century, however, were the connections between cattle raiding and the solidarity of local communities. Particularly among pastoral and semi-pastoral groups in the Punjab on the fringes of agricultural settlement, cattle stealing had long involved the competitive raiding of community grazing grounds, and was, as some British officials suggested, a practice associated with the protection of clan livelihood and the defense of community honour. Physically undertaken largely by young men, 'who show off their prowess by lifting the finest animals they hear of', cattle stealing was viewed by many local leaders as far from criminal.}}

David Gilmartin states that "cattle were among the most ubiquitous and important forms of moveable property in India, and cattle stealing was among the most prevalent crimes in northern India during the colonial period" in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;David Gilmartin (2003), Cattle, crime and colonialism: Property as negotiation in north India, ''The Indian Economic &amp; Social History Review'', Volume 40, Issue 1, pages 33-56&lt;/ref&gt; However, adds Gilmartin, cattle thefts in India were "marked by contradictions" with many village and clan chiefs involved in cattle theft networks and shared in the profits in western Punjab. These were recognized by the colonial government as "key administrative intermediaries".&lt;ref name=gilmartin33&gt;David Gilmartin (2003), Cattle, crime and colonialism: Property as negotiation in north India, ''The Indian Economic &amp; Social History Review'', Volume 40, Issue 1, pages 33-56, '''Quote:''' "(...) 'The heads of villages and even the chiefs of clans,' the British reported, 'connive at the practice, and participate in the profits.’ In the late nineteenth century almost all the leading men of the pastoral bar, the arid interfluvial tracts of the western Punjab, including many of those recognised as key administrative intermediaries by the British, were rassagirs-men who protected networks of cattle theft."&lt;/ref&gt; The crime came to be known as "cattle lifting" (like shop lifting),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rosanna Masiola|author2=Renato Tomei|title=Law, Language and Translation: From Concepts to Conflicts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhrGBgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-14271-5|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was practiced by thieves, by organized mafia and by armies during conquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ranajit Guha|title=Elementary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency in Colonial India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y5SrnXC-HNcC |year=1999|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-2348-8|pages=151–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cattle theft were a source of riots and civil disturbances.

According to Ramnarayan Rawat, a professor of South Asian History, cattle theft (or ''languri'') was the "most widely reported crime investigated by the Uttar Pradesh police in the 1880s and 1890s, and was considered the most organized and widespread agricultural crime because cows were regarded as the most valuable animal in Indian society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramnarayan S.

During this period and through the early part of 20th-century, the British administration routinely accused [[Chamar]]s (untouchables, Hindus) of large-scale cattle deaths by poisoning and of theft for the purposes of obtaining skins for leather trade. According to Rawat, these accusations were "standard bureaucratic response" that continued after the British rule ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramnarayan S.

In 1930, an elderly Hindu woman alleged that Bengali Muslims had stolen her bullock, for sacrifice during the Islamic festival of [[Eid al-Adha|Bakri-Id]], when she saw her bullock in the [[Digboi]] market place. Hindus with sticks and Muslims with stones collected, triggering waves of riots in this part of [[Assam]], accompanied by looting and killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yasmin Saikia|author2=Amit Baishya|title=Northeast India: A Place of Relations|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xzTSDgAAQBAJ |year= 2017|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 978-1-108-22578-6|pages= 125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David H. Bayley, a professor of Criminal Justice, the crime of "cattle theft is a matter of deadly seriousness in India," because it is an agrarian society where "many people live on the cheerless threshold of starvation".&lt;ref name="Bayley2015p114"/&gt; Cattle, states Bayley, are as important as children and grown adults "weep bitterly over the loss of their stock". In 1963 alone, over 20,000 cases of cattle thefts and arrests were reported in India.&lt;ref name="Bayley2015p114"&gt;{{cite book|author=David H.

A 2013 report by Gardiner Harris's in the ''Delhi Journal'' of ''The New York Times'' stated that cattle theft had increased in recent times in New Delhi, linked to an increase in the consumption of meat among Indians. The meat was primarily chicken, but included beef. Harris argued that cattle were left free to roam the streets, making them easy targets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/world/asia/cow-thefts-on-the-rise-in-india.html For New Breed of Rustlers, Nothing Is Sacred], Gardiner Harris (MAY 26, 2013), The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tomei45&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rosanna Masiola|author2=Renato Tomei|title=Law, Language and Translation: From Concepts to Conflicts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhrGBgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-14271-5|pages=43–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''The Hindu'' newspaper, analysis of data published by India's National Sample Survey 2016 shows that less than one per cent of Hindus in the [[Hindi belt]] consume beef or buffalo meat.

According to ''The New York Times'', organized mafia gangs pick up the cattle they can find and sell them to illegal slaughterhouses. These crimes are locally called "cattle rustling" or "cattle lifting".&lt;ref name=nytimes2013&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/world/asia/cow-thefts-on-the-rise-in-india.html For New Breed of Rustlers, Nothing Is Sacred], Gardiner Harris (MAY 26, 2013), The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; According to media reports, India has numerous illegal slaughterhouses.

The theft of cattle for slaughter and beef production is economically attractive to the mafias in India. In 2013, states Gardiner Harris, a truck can fit 10 cows, each fetching about 5,000 rupees (about US$ 94 in 2013), or over US$900 per cattle stealing night operation. In a country where some 800 million people live on less than US$2 per day, such theft-based mafia operations are financially attractive.&lt;ref name=nytimes2013/&gt; According to Andrew Buncombe, when smuggled across the border, the price per cattle increases nearly threefold and the crime is even more attractive financially.&lt;ref name=buncombe2012&gt;{{cite web | last=Buncombe | first=Andrew | title=Nothing's sacred: the illegal trade in India's holy cows | website=The Independent | date=2012-06-01 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/nothings-sacred-the-illegal-trade-in-indias-holy-cows-7808483.html | access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many states have reported rising thefts of cattle and associated violence, according to ''The Indian Express''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/web-edits/in-assam-mob-fury-and-cattle-thieves-have-a-long-history-4636848/ In Assam, mob fury and cattle thieves have a long history], Samudra Gupta Kashyap (May 2, 2017), The Indian Express&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cattle smuggling in India ==
'''Cattle smuggling in India''' is the movement of cattle for slaughter and processing from the states of [[India]] where [[Cattle slaughter in India|cattle slaughter]] is illegal to those states where it is legal as well as to neighboring countries such as [[Bangladesh]]. It is widespread in India, with some estimates stating that over a million cattle are smuggled every year.&lt;ref name=buncombe2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibtimes2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=The Bengal Borderland: Beyond State and Nation in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqTIhTWuAXcC&amp;pg=PA183 |year=2005|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-1-84331-145-4|pages=183 note 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cattle smuggling, states Jason Cons – a professor of Anthropology with publications on India-Bangladesh border communities, is a significant source of communal tension as it implies "transportation of sacred cattle [cow] for slaughter in Muslim meat markets".&lt;ref name="Cons2016p126"/&gt; It is also a source of crimes, violence and has trigerred disputes between the border officials at the India-Bangladesh border.&lt;ref name=ibtimes2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=mondal/&gt;&lt;ref name=jcons125/&gt;

===Within India===
According to Frederick Simoons, cattle smuggling was prevalent during the colonial era such as to the [[Portuguese Goa]]. It supplied the urban Goan demand for beef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick J.

The numbers are astounding: almost five thousand cattle trucks passed daily through one town on their way to slaughterhouses in the port of Calcutta, with frozen beef ultimately reaching consumers in the Near East."&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cows are often smuggled from states such as [[Rajasthan]] to slaughterhouses elsewhere, states Amrita Basu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Amrita Basu|title=Violent Conjunctures in Democratic India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TTrjCQAAQBAJ |year= 2015|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-08963-1|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between January 2009 and February 2016, the Rajasthan police registered over 3,000 cases of cow smuggling, arrested nearly 6,000 people for the crime, and seized over 2,700 vehicles used for cattle smuggling over the seven year period, states a report in ''The Hindustan Times''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-400-people-arrested-in-rajasthan-for-cow-smuggling-from-2009-2016/story-c2SOZMVzZBluDlzpzlu2jJ.html 6,400 people arrested in Rajasthan for cow smuggling from 2009-2016], Press Trust of India, The Hindustran Times (April 14 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattle smuggling in India, states Reena Martins, is an organized and violent criminal network. In Bihar for example, cow smugglers chopped off the fingers of a railway crossing gate guard when he refused to allow smuggling trucks to pass through before a train.&lt;ref name=martins2017/&gt; Corruption, bribes and cruelty to animals is a routine part of the operation. Martins states that the racket controlled by the "meat mafia" is worth $5 billion in India, and the smuggled cattle are sold for slaughter in ''khattals'' with much of the smuggling destined to supply the meat demand in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=martins2017&gt;[http://www.newindianexpress.com/magazine/2017/jul/22/a-dark-trade-1631340--1.html A dark trade], Reena Martins, The New Indian Express (23 July 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattle smuggling from India into Bangladesh is akin to drug smuggling networks, states Debdatta Chowdhury.&lt;ref name=debchlaw/&gt; A portion of the smuggled cattle – mainly cows and ox – is obtained from the western and northern states of India, which are predominantly non beef-eating Hindus, transported across India then smuggled across the West Bengal border to satisfy the demand in the predominantly beef-eating Muslim Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=debchlaw/&gt; The states which serve as sources of this smuggled cattle in thousands per day include [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Haryana]], [[Punjab]], [[Gujarat]], [[Bihar]], [[Odisha]], numbering thousands each day. According to Chowdhury, between 5000 and 15,000 cows are smuggled everyday across the Bangladesh border. The smuggling generates an average of about US$ 20 per cow in income for the smuggler, about US$ 7 in bribes for Bangladeshi border officials and about US$ 8 in bribes for Indian border officials.&lt;ref name=debchlaw&gt;Debdatta Chowdhury (2016), ''Crossers of the peripheries: Some aspects of cross-border livelihood practices along the West Bengal-Bangladesh border'', Westminster Law Review, 5(1), pages 1-11&lt;/ref&gt; Another report by Ashish, Patthak and Khan in ''India Today'' states that the operation is a well organized racket of smugglers who use bribes, rampant corruption and evade the law almost every day. They smuggle "young and ageing" cattle from India to Bangladesh slaughterhouses, while the payment is handled through [[hawala]] black market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3767865/Smugglers-selling-Indian-cows-DOUBLE-price-trafficking-Bangladesh.html Smugglers are selling Indian cows for DOUBLE their price by trafficking them to Bangladesh], K. Ashish and Sushant Patthak and Jamshed Khan, India Today (Mail Today, 31 August 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources estimate the cattle smuggling volume at a different level. According to ''The Sunday Guardian'', "cattle smuggling is rampant in Bengal, with an estimated 60,000 heads of cattle being smuggled out of India into Bangladesh, every day" in 2015, but the rate of this smuggling has dropped because of rising surveillance at the international border.&lt;ref name=mondal&gt;[http://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/9751-bengal-s-cow-smuggling-business-drying Bengal’s cow smuggling business is drying up], Dibyendu MONDAL, North 24 Parganas, West Bengal, The Sunday Guardian, (11 June, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The cattle smuggling rate is placed at nearly two million a year by Robert Wirsing and Samir Das in a 2016 report, with an annual value of about US$ 1.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wirsing and Samir Das (2016), Bengal’s Beleaguered Borders, The Asia Papers, no. 1, Center for International and Regional Studies, Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Qatar, page 24, Quote:"2 million cattle are smuggled into Bangladesh from India each year. Smuggling cattle has become a huge industry, reportedly worth annually close to Rs.10,000 crore."&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattle smugglers, states ''The Times of India'', use dyes to recolor and camouflage the cattle. This makes cattle identification difficult to ease their smuggling across the border, while some groups use grazing pretext to evade the Indian Border Security Force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shillong/Cattle-smugglers-dodge-guards-with-fake-grazing/articleshow/55107399.cms Cattle smugglers dodge guards with 'fake grazing'], The Times of India (Oct 28, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shillong/Smugglers-give-cattle-make-overs-to-baffle-security-forces-BSF/articleshow/53975251.cms Smugglers give cattle 'make-overs' to baffle security forces: BSF], Manosh Das (Sep 2, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

(...) the illegal mass-theft of cattle is a huge problem thousands of miles away from the Chisum Trail – on the border between India and Bangladesh. Along the largely porous boundary between Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal, cattle-raids and cattle-smuggling, often conducted by criminal gangs, raise hundreds of millions of dollars annually in illicit profits. The activity is so lucrative and dangerous that it often costs the lives of the perpetrators and innocent bystanders. (...) Bimal Pramanik, an independent researcher in Kolkata, told the Monitor that Bangladesh has an insatiable demand for beef. 'Bangladeshi slaughterhouses cannot source even 1 million cows from within the country. If Indian cows do not reach the Bangladeshi slaughterhouses, there will be a big crisis there,' he said, adding that he estimates three-fourths of all cows slaughtered in Bangladesh originated in India.

The '''Chigil''' ('''Chihil''', and also '''Jigil''', '''Djikil''', '''Chiyal''') were a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribe known from the 7th century CE as living around [[Issyk Kul]] lake area. They were considered to be descended from two of the "''Six Chuy tribes''" of the [[Chuban]], the Chuyue and Chumi. They are known to have been speakers of the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] group of the [[Turkic languages]].

==Etymology==

Sinologist Yu. A. Zuev notes that the Chinese transcription of Chigil, 處月 ''Chuyue'' ([[Middle Chinese]] ([[Zhengzhang Shangfang|ZS]]): /t͡ɕʰɨʌˣ-ŋʉɐt̚/) may be [[calque|calqued]] as "abode of the Moon [god]". However, Zuev cautions that neither Turkic-Buddhist texts, nor the Turkic-Manichaean literature and other sources containing information about Turkic Manichaeism, give a genealogical meaning in reference to the invocation of the Sun and Moon (Turk. kün ay).&lt;ref&gt;[Bang, Gabain, 1931, p. 333; Bang, Gabain, Rachmati, 1934, p. 159]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yu. Zuev, "Early Türks: Essays of history and ideology", Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 249, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|9985-4-4152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first reference to the Chigils comes from the "History of the Sui dynasty" (581–680, Chji-i &lt; tšįək-iət &lt; chigil).&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton J. "Toquz-Oghuz et On-Uyghur." ''Journal Asiatique''. No 250, 1962 p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to medieval writers, the city of ''Chigil'' was at "a distance of a human voice" from [[Taraz]].&lt;ref&gt;Volin, 1960, p. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zuev, "Early Turks: Essays of history and ideology", Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 191, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|9985-4-4152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 11th-century story by [[Mahmud Kashgari]] places the events in the time of the Zu-l-Karnein ("the "Bihorn", [[Alexander the Great]]) 4th century BCE:

{{quote|When the armies of Zu-l-Karnein reached Talas in the Manichean country Argu, a heavy rainstorm formed thick mud. The road became impassable, and angry Zu-l-Karnein exclaimed in Persian: "In chi gil ast?!" – "What is this mud?! We cannot get out of it!"  He ordered a building be erected on the spot called Chigil. Turks in the area were called Chigils. Nomadic Turks, who adopted the Chigil type of [long] clothes were also called Chigils, from Djeyhun (Amu Darya) to the Chin (China).&lt;ref&gt;Zuev, "Early Turks: Essays of history and ideology", Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 191, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|9985-4-4152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ... The nomad Chigil (as well as the [[Tukhsi|Tukhsī]]) lived near the township of Quyās lying beyond Barsghān and watered by the two Keykān rivers flowing into the Ili&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''., iii, 132, ''v.i.'', p. 301, note 4. Quyash ("Sun" in Turkish) is supposed to have lain on the left bank of the [[Ili River|Ili]]; in Mongol times it was the camping place of [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatay]]&lt;/ref&gt; ... Another group of the tribe lived in the township of Chigil, near Ṭarāz, and a third one in the villages of the same name near Kāshgar.}}

Kashghari&lt;ref&gt;Kāshgharī, i, 330&lt;/ref&gt; says that the [[Oghuz Turks]] used to call "Chigil" all the Turks between the Oxus and Northern China.&lt;ref&gt;[[Minorsky]], V. ''Hudud al-'Ālam''. "Regions of the world. A Persian Geography 372 A. H. – 982 A. D." London, 1937, pp. 298–299&lt;/ref&gt;

The reigning clan of the Western Turkic Manichean Chigil tribe was the [[Shato]], which also founded the state of [[Later Tang]] (923–936) in Northern China, and adopted the Chinese surname Li. Its founder, Li Keün, was from the Shato Dragon tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Malyavkin, 1974, p. 100; Li Fan, Ch. 425, p. 3458-3459&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Shato, the dragon cult was predominant. The annals noted that Shato prayers "followed the old tradition of the northern custom" near Thunder-mountain, at the Dragon Gate.&lt;ref&gt;Se Tszüichjen, Ch. 32, p. 225, f. 4b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zuev, "Early Turks: Essays of history and ideology", Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 145, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|9985-4-4152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sima Qian]] writes: "Shato is actually (or primarily) a ''Chüse'' tribe".&lt;ref&gt;Sima Qian, The "Cloudy Mirror" Ch. 223, p. 7169&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=I indeed found the Qushe, in Sima Qian's chapter on the Xiongnu, translated by Watson; yet Sima Qian did not mention the Shatuo|date=December 2018}} The transcription Chüse reflects the Turkic ''jüz'' "hundred". The Chigils-Shato were [[Manichaeans]], and "hundred" is not always a military team, but also a religious category ''yüz er'' "hundred monk men" as is stated, for example, on a number of the Manichaean [[Yenisei Kyrgyz|Yenisei]] monuments of [[Old Turkic script|ancient Turkic writings]]. Thus ''yüz er'', as opposed to ''otuz oglan'' or ''otuz er'', is a category of dominating level.&lt;ref&gt;Zuev, "Early Turks: Essays of history and ideology", Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 146, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|9985-4-4152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, 屈射 Qūshè's [[Old Chinese]] pronunciation has been minimally reconstructed by Sinologist Axel Schuessler as ''*khut-mlak'' and [[Eastern Han Chinese|later]] ''*kʰut-źa(k) ~ *kʰut-ja(k)''.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, Peter B. (2014) "Qıpčaq" in ''Turcology and Linguistics'', Hacettepe University, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chigils were prominent in the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]], where they formed the main body of the troops.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vasily Bartold|Barthold]], ''Turkestan'', 317.&lt;/ref&gt; The power in the Karakhanid state was divided between the nobility of two tribal groups, Chigils and Yagma, which in the 9th century formed the nucleus of the [[Karluks|Karluk]] tribal union.

Chigils and [[Yagma]], and also the [[Tuhsi]], one of the [[Türgesh]] tribes, the remains of the [[Old Turkic|Orkhon Turks]], united in the Karluk tribal union, and the history of these tribes, at least since the 9th century, is indivisible.&lt;ref&gt;S. G. Klyashtorny, T. I. Sultanov, “States And Peoples Of The Eurasian Steppe”, St. Petersburg, 2004, p.117, {{ISBN|5-85803-255-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hudud al-'Ālam'', compiled in 982–3 CE, describes the Chigils as members of the Karluk state, occupying the Zhetysu territories including regions around Issyk Kul to the north and east of the Karluks. They are described as possessing great riches and that their king "is one of themselves." It is also reported that "Some of them worship the Sun and the stars.".&lt;ref&gt;Minorsky, V. ''Hudud al-'Ālam''. "Regions of the world. A Persian Geography 372 A. H. – 982 A. D." London, 1937, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; The Karluk Kaganate was divided into two parts, eastern and western, headed by their [[Khagan|Kagans]]. The eastern Kagan was the senior Kagan, with his court in [[Kashgar]] and [[Balasagun]] (Buran fortress, near Tokmak in [[Kyrgyzstan]]). He was from the Chigil tribe and had the title Arslan Kara-Hakan. The western was the lesser Kagan, from the Yagma tribe, with the title Bogra Kara-Kagan and his court in [[Taraz]], and later in [[Samarkand]].&lt;ref&gt;S. G. Klyashtorny, T. I. Sultanov, “States And Peoples Of The Eurasian Steppe”, St. Petersburg, 2004, p.118, {{ISBN|5-85803-255-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eleventh century the Chigils became independent. Kashgari writes that they consisted of three branches.&lt;ref&gt;Faruk Sumer, "Oguzlar", Ankara, 1967, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Mongol invasion]] of [[Turkestan]], the Turks in northern Turkestan and in the [[Tien Shan]] region, among them the Chigils, [[Yagma]], [[Karluks]], [[Argu]] and [[Tuhsi]], had to give up their territory to the eastern nomadic groups. They migrated to [[Transoxania]] and [[Kashgar|Kashgharia]].&lt;ref&gt;Z. V. Togan, "Turkistan Tarihi", Istanbul, 1947, p. 60, note 80&lt;/ref&gt;

There are presently four villages in [[Turkey]] called ''Chigil'', indicating that some Chigils migrated to Asia Minor after the Mongol invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Faruk Sumer, "Oguzlar", Ankara, 1967, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

The Chigil were known for their religious dedication. The first depictions of the Chigils describe them as adherents of [[Manichaeism]]. Later sources describe the Chigils as [[Nestorian Christians]]. The Zhetysu area, a former Chigil territory, is rich with Christian and pre-Christian archaeological remains, and the [[Taraz|Talas]] area is especially saturated with religious monuments and historical reports. the [[Gagauzes]], a distinct  [[Pontus (region)|Pontic]] Turkic tribe known for their steadfast adherence to [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christianity]], have a folk legend associating their descent from the Chigils.

In Manichaeism, the lion, mighty and ruthless king of animals, is a central image. This demonstrates an imported ideology; the lion is not native to Central Asia, and so it originally did not have symbolic significance for the population there. The building found by the archaeologists, without traces of economic activities, served as a chapel of the inhabitants depicted in long robes: the Chigils, whose symbol was a lion (Turk. ''Arslan, Bars'').&lt;ref&gt;Yu. Zuev, "Early Türks: Essays of history and ideology", Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 193, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|9985-4-4152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection between [[Taraz|Talas]], Manichaeism  and the Lion is recorded in the Turco-Manichean "Sacred book of two fundamentals" (Iki jïltïz nom), fragments of which were found in 1907 at [[Kara-Khoja]] in the [[Turpan]] oasis by [[Albert von Le Coq]]. The book was dedicated to the ruler (Beg) of the Chigil-Arslan tribes, named Il-Tirgüg, Ap-Burguchan, Alp-Tarhan [Henning, 1977, p.&amp;nbsp;552]. It was completed in Argu-Talas city (Altun Argu Talas). A postscript in the manuscript noted an Arslan Mengü that used the book.&lt;ref&gt;Zuev, "Early Turks: Essays of history and ideology", Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 203, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|9985-4-4152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talas had four Manichean cloisters: in the Chigil-balyk, Kashu, Ordu-kent and Yigyan-kent.&lt;ref&gt;Yu. Zuev, "Early Türks: Essays of history and ideology", Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 207, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|9985-4-4152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 7th century, Chigils, Chumuls and Karluks were united by the Western Turkic yabgu Aru in his anti-[[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] uprising. The yabgu's name, Aru, is identical with the Turkic-Manichean ''arïg'' (like ''arïg dïntar'' "pure priest").&lt;ref&gt;Zuev, "Early Turks: Essays of history and ideology", Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 221, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|9985-4-4152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynastic strife between competing tribes of the [[Tuhsi]] and Ases in the Türgesh Kaganate also had religious significance. The new dynasty was established by Sakal of the [[Tukhsi|Tuhs]] tribe, who was challenged by the leader of the As tribe Sülük, who took over the Kagan's throne in 716. After Sülük's death, his son Tuhsan was raised to Kaganship in [[Suyab]], and  the "[[Tuhsi]] Sovereign" Sogdo-Türgesh coin was minted in his honor. In 738, when Türgesh Tuhsan was enthroned, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] ambassador Valentine came to the Tuhsan court. In the 11th century, the [[Tuhsi]] tribe professed Manichaeism and were called  [[Tuhsi]]-Chigil, i.e. "Tuhsi-Manicheans".&lt;ref&gt;[Mahmud Kashgari, I, p. 399]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yu.Zuev, "Early Türks: Essays of history and ideology", Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 210, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|9985-4-4152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toponymic traces==
Many settlements recorded in medieval sources have names derived from the ethnonym Chigil, such as Chigilkant and Chigil-balyk in [[Xinjiang]], and Chigil in the Zhetysu area:&lt;ref&gt;Sh. Kamoliddin, “Ancient Türkic Toponyms of the Middle Asia”, Tashkent, Shark, 2006, p. 42 (in Russian, no ISBN)&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Ages, a city, Yar, is mentioned as located on the southern bank of lake Issyk-kul. This city is the capital of the leader of the Djikil (i.e. Chigil) tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Sh. Kamoliddin, “Ancient Türkic Toponyms of the Middle Asia”, Tashkent, Shark, 2006, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; The city retained its name in the form ''Chal'' till present. The various forms of this toponym (Shiyan, Shal, Chal) come from the Turkic ethnonym Chiyal (i.e. Chigil).&lt;ref&gt;Sh. Kamoliddin, “Ancient Türkic Toponyms of the Middle Asia”, Tashkent, Shark, 2006, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnotoponym Chigil is formed with an affix -il (Turk. ''land, country'').&lt;ref&gt;Sh. Kamoliddin, “Ancient Türkic Toponyms of the Middle Asia”, Tashkent, Shark, 2006, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Community Benefits Agreement''' ("CBA") in the United States is a [[contract]] signed by community groups and a real estate developer that requires the developer to provide specific amenities and/or mitigations to the local community or neighborhood. In exchange, the community groups agree to publicly support the project, or at least not oppose it. Often, negotiating a CBA relies heavily upon the formation of a multi-issue, broad based community coalition including community, environmental, faith-based and labor organizations.

In the United Kingdom, [[Section 106 agreement]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and in Canada, "Section 37" agreements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/01/16/section-37-what-it-is-and-why-everybodys-fighting-about-it-keenan.html| title=Section 37 — What it is, and why everybody's fighting about it| first=Edward| last=Keenan| date=January 16, 2015| publisher=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly require certain benefits from developers, but differ from CBAs in that they are part of development agreements with governments, not communities.  CBAs are generally private, contractual agreements, although they can in some instances be made part of a development agreement with a city.&lt;ref&gt;Graser, D. Community Benefits and Tower Renewal (Evergreen, 2016). See also Gross, J. Community Benefits Agreements:  Definitions, Values and Legal Enforceability, Journal of Affordable Housing Vol. 17:1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==

[[Economic development]] projects are often heavily [[subsidized]] by taxpayer dollars, but there is usually no guarantee that a project's “ripple effects” will benefit current residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/accountable-development/beginners-guide|title=Good Jobs First, A Beginner's Guide to Accountable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developments can cause inner-city [[gentrification]], pushing out low-income residents as housing prices rise, or they may create only [[working poor|low-wage retail and service sector jobs]]. As a result, many metropolitan regions continue to experience problems related to [[poverty]] and [[affordable housing|housing]], despite major investments in economic development.

Responding to these problems, the CBA model was created in the late 1990s as a way for the communities most impacted by economic development projects to participate in the planning process and seek to ensure that development benefits will accrue to existing communities.&lt;ref name="Understanding Community Benefits Agreements"&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1272795 Patricia Salkin and Amy Lavine, Understanding Community Benefits Agreements: Equitable Development, Social Justice and Other Considerations for Developers, Municipalities and Community Organizations], published at 26 UCLA J. Envir. L. &amp; Pol. 291 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; For developers, negotiating with community representatives can be an attractive way to gain community support and help move their projects forward. Participating in CBA negotiations can eliminate surprises in the development approvals process and allow developers to work with a unified coalition rather than having to engage community organizations one by one.&lt;ref name="CBA Handbook"&gt;[http://www.communitybenefits.org/downloads/CBA%20Handbook%202005%20final.pdf Julian Gross, Greg LeRoy &amp; Madeline Janis-Aparicio, Community Benefits Agreements: Making Development Projects Accountable (Good Jobs First 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Community Benefits Movement==

As [[local governments]] grappled with their responsibility to shape development and [[land use]] patterns, the community benefits movement emerged to challenge conventional thinking and offer a broader vision. Related to [[smart growth]] and [[environmental justice]], the community benefits movement aims to ensure that the main purpose of economic development is to bring measurable, permanent improvements to the lives of affected residents, particularly those in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color. Organizations allied with the community benefits movement have pressured the public sector to play a more strategic role in land use planning and urban growth, and to leverage economic development subsidies toward the creation of good jobs, affordable housing, and neighborhood services that improve the quality of life for all residents.&lt;ref name="Understanding Community Benefits Agreements" /&gt;

The community benefits movement began in Los Angeles, with successful implementation at mixed-use projects at Hollywood and Highland,&lt;ref&gt;http://communitybenefits.blogspot.com/2008/01/hollywood-and-highland-center.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Staples Center / LA Live.&lt;ref&gt;http://communitybenefits.blogspot.com/2008/01/success-of-hollywood-and-highland-cba.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has since spread rapidly to other cities, including [[Atlanta]], [[Chicago]], [[Denver]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Minneapolis]], [[New Haven]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[San Diego]], [[San Francisco]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Seattle]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]].&lt;ref name="Case Studies of Current and Developing Agreements"&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1117681 Patricia Salkin and Amy Lavine, Negotiating for Social Justice and the Promise of Community Benefits Agreements: Case Studies of Current and Developing Agreements], published at 17 J. Affordable Hous. &amp; Cmty. Dev. L. 113 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Leading organizations include The Partnership for Working Families [http://www.communitybenefits.org/], Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy ("LAANE") [http://laane.org/], [[Strategic Actions for a Just Economy]] ("SAJE")[http://www.saje.net/], SCOPE [https://web.archive.org/web/20111117040117/http://www.scopela.org/section.php?id=39], Georgia Stand-Up [http://www.georgiastandup.org/], and Pittsburg UNITED [http://www.pittsburghunited.org/]

CBA advocates contend that the community benefits approach improves the development process for the community, developers and local officials by creating an overall win-win-win scenario.&lt;ref name="Leveraging Partnerships"&gt;[http://www.communitybenefits.org/downloads/CBs%20for%20Developers.pdf Community Benefits: Leveraging Partnerships for Successful Development (The Partnership for Working Families 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the principles and goals that CBA advocates seek to promote include:

'''Inclusiveness.''' The CBA negotiation process can provide a mechanism to ensure that community concerns are heard and addressed. While some cities do a good job of seeking community input and responding to it, many do not. Low-income neighborhoods, non-English speaking areas, and communities of color have historically been excluded from the development process. Laws concerning public notice and participation are often poorly enforced, and official public hearings are frequently held at times and places that are not neighborhood-friendly. Having a CBA negotiation process can help to address these problems, providing a forum for all parts of an affected community.

'''Enforceability.''' A CBA can ensure that a developer’s promises regarding community benefits are legally enforceable. Developers “pitching” a project often make promises that are never written into any project approval documents, and even when they are, they may not be monitored and enforced by the relevant government agencies. By creating an enforcement mechanism or expanding the class of parties who can enforce these promises, CBAs can make enforcement much easier.

'''Accountability.''' CBAs enable citizens to hold governments accountable for the use of tax dollars by giving them a voice in how development subsidies are distributed.&lt;ref name="Definitions, Values, and Legal Enforceability"&gt;[http://www.communitybenefits.org/downloads/CBAs%20Definitions%20Values%20and%20Legal%20Enforceability.pdf Julian Gross, Community Benefits Agreements: Definitions, Values, and Legal Enforceability, 17 J. Affordable Hous. 35 (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==CBA Coalitions==
At the heart of the community benefits strategy are community organizing and coalition building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/17549175.2012.693125 | volume=5 | title=The grassroots and New Urbanism: a case from a Southern California Latino community | journal=Journal of Urbanism: International Research on Placemaking and Urban Sustainability | pages=219–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aecf.org/upload/PublicationFiles/AECF_CBA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10705420902862124 | volume=17 | title=Organizing Community and Labor Coalitions for Community Benefits Agreements in African American Communities: Ensuring Successful Partnerships | journal=Journal of Community Practice | pages=120–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizing and maintaining a coalition, facilitating compromise and crafting a shared agenda are essential to creating a successful CBA. Coalitions can include a variety of community groups, such as neighborhood groups, environmental organizations, good-government organizations, labor unions, and faith-based organizations.&lt;ref name="CBA Handbook" /&gt; Coalitions are usually unincorporated, but member community groups may enter into an operating agreement to govern their relationship in the coalition. A model CBA Coalition Operating Agreement has been created by the Public Law Center at [[Tulane Law School]].&lt;ref name="Operating Agreement"&gt;[http://www.law.tulane.edu/assets/0/260/262/719A253B-F54A-4A56-BBC4-7FDF754CCCAB.pdf Community Benefits Coalition Operating Agreement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elected officials and government agencies often play an active role in CBA negotiations. In California and other jurisdictions where development agreements are authorized, government representatives may be formal CBA signatories. In other cases, government officials may play a more informal role by facilitating CBA negotiations and encouraging cooperation.&lt;ref name="CBA Handbook"/&gt;

==CBA Negotiations==

Typically, negotiations between a CBA coalition and a developer begin after a project has been announced but prior to governmental approval. However, there are examples of legislative CBA requirements attached to subsidies that impose community benefit standards on land within particular districts. For example, developers participating in the [[Atlanta Beltline]] project that opt to use [[tax increment financing]] are required to incorporate community benefits through a development or funding agreement.&lt;ref name="Case Studies of Current and Developing Agreements" /&gt;

==Possible benefits==
The CBA contract model allows each particular CBA to be tailored to the community’s needs, the size and type of the proposed development, and the relative bargaining power of the community groups and the developer. Benefits may be provided by the developer itself, or a CBA may require the developer to impose CBA provisions on its tenants, vendors, and contractors. Typically, CBAs include job quality standards, [[local hiring]] programs, and affordable housing requirements.&lt;ref name="CBA Handbook" /&gt;

Other benefits include, among other things:

* [[Living wage]] and [[prevailing wage]] requirements
* Local hiring goals
* Job training programs
* [[Supplier diversity|Minority/women/local business contracting goals]]
* Provisions prohibiting developers from hiring contractors that have violated labor or other occupational laws (known as "responsible contractor" provisions)
* [[Union neutrality]] requirements
* Retail/commercial space set-asides for small and local businesses
* [[Big box]] retail restrictions
* [[Green building]] requirements
* Space set-asides for neighborhood organizations, community centers, child-care centers, and other non-profits
* Construction of [[parks]] and recreational facilities
* Provisions for community input in the selection of tenants
* Funding for community organizations/programs
* Mitigations in excess of those required under state/local law that address parking, traffic, increased pollution, and other environmental impacts
* [[Affordable housing]] requirements

The range of benefits offered by a CBA has been explored extensively in the scholarly literature,&lt;ref&gt;David A. Marcello, "Community Benefit Agreements: New Vehicle for Investment in America's Neighborhoods," 39 ''The Urban Lawyer'' 657 (2007), found at [http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlscenters/PublicLawCenter/home.aspx?id=3906 Tulane Public Law website] and [http://www.law.tulane.edu/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;ItemID=6232 Tulane law School website article page].  Accessed September 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as conferences, in an effort to raise awareness about the benefits of CBA's for developers, local government, and struggling communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlscenters/PublicLawCenter/home.aspx?id=3906 Win-Win-Win: The Advantages of CBA's for the Community, Developers, Government, and You, The Public Law Center and the Urban Land Institute Symposium on May 11, 2012]. Accessed September 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monitoring==

Community groups should consider how each provision in a CBA will be monitored and enforced. Although financial commitments and other one-time benefits may be fairly easy to monitor, other developer and tenant commitments, such as living wage and local hiring requirements, may be in place for decades and require long-term oversight. To address this issue, CBAs have included periodic reporting and disclosure requirements, complaint investigation mechanisms, and provisions establishing oversight committees. Where a CBA is incorporated into a development agreement, government agencies may also play a role in monitoring the CBA's implementation.&lt;ref name="Understanding Community Benefits Agreements" /&gt;

==Enforcement==

As a CBA is a legally binding contract, it can be enforced only by the parties that signed it. CBAs that are incorporated into development agreements can be enforced by the government as well as by community groups.&lt;ref name="CBA Handbook" /&gt; To date, there is no [[case law]] regarding the validity and enforceability of CBAs. [[Donald Trump|Donald Trump's]] 1993 CBA-like contract relating to the New York City [[Riverside South (New York City)|Riverside South]] project was the subject of a 2008 New York Appellate Division opinion, but the court held that the contract's terms were expired.[http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2008/2008_10229.htm]

==Concerns and issues==
Although numerous CBAs have proven to be successful tools to improve the economic development process, a variety of criticisms have emerged. Perhaps the most significant criticism is that CBAs offer no way to ensure that they are truly representative of community needs and desires. The [[Atlantic Yards public opinion|Atlantic Yards CBA]], for example, has been criticized because it was negotiated by only a handful of community groups, all of which are receiving funding from the developer, while many other community groups were excluded from the negotiations. A report from the [[New York City Bar Association]] has also questioned whether CBA negotiators will drive appropriate bargains with developers, and whether CBAs will interfere with the planning process. Various legal problems relating to [[exactions]] and [[consideration]] may also weaken the effectiveness of CBAs.&lt;ref name="The Role of Community Benefit Agreements in New York City's Land Use Process"&gt;[http://www.nycbar.org/pdf/report/uploads/20071844-TheRoleofCommunityBenefitAgreementsinNYCLandUseProcess.pdf New York City Bar Association, The Role of Community Benefit Agreements in New York City's Land Use Process (Mar. 8, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent examples==
CBAs have been negotiated for numerous projects. The most well known CBA is likely the [[Los Angeles]] [[Staples Center]] CBA, which has generally been viewed as a success.[http://www.communitybenefits.org/article.php?id=1475] Other projects that have had CBAs include the Dearborn Street [[Goodwill Industries|Goodwill]] project in [[Seattle]], the [[Consol Energy Center]] arena (for the [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Penguins hockey team]]) in [https://web.archive.org/web/20121219161053/http://hdcg.org/HillCBA Pittsburgh], [[San Francisco's]] Bayview-Hunters Point residential development, the Gates-Cherokee redevelopment project in [[Denver]], and the Ballpark Village development in [[San Diego]].[http://www.communitybenefits.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=155#cbaslist]

The "CBAs" of some recent projects have not been accepted as legitimate CBAs by advocates of the community benefits movement. For example, the "CBA" for the new [[Yankee Stadium]] has not been considered to be a "true" CBA because it was negotiated by elected officials, not community groups.&lt;ref name="Definitions, Values, and Legal Enforceability" /&gt; The agreement did include significant community benefits such as $28,000,000 in grants and free tickets for local organizations.&lt;ref name=Yankees&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Timothy |title=$28 Million for the Bronx in the Yankees' Stadium Plan |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/22/nyregion/22bronx.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |via=The New York Times website |accessdate=October 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the CBA has not been smoothly implemented. In 2009, the former administer the community fund sued the Yankees' community charity, claiming that the fund had been mismanaged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/nyregion/01bronx.html?_r=3]&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], the city of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, awarded a contract to Millennium Development Corporation to build its {{convert|600000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, 600-unit athletes' village on south east False Creek. This development included a CBA with targets to create 100 jobs for locally sourced and trained inner city residents and to procure a targeted $15 million in goods and services from the inner city. It also included a $750,000 legacy fund to train inner city residents.&lt;ref&gt;City of Vancouver {{cite web|url=http://vancouver.ca/olympicvillage/pdf/CBAFactsheet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328052745/http://vancouver.ca/olympicvillage/PDF/CBAFactsheet.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBA included investment and support from the Canadian Federal Government, BC Provincial Government, the City of Vancouver and Building Opportunities with Business Inner-City Society [[Building Opportunities with Business]] (a community economic development non-profit also known as BOB) these parties collectively are recognized under the Vancouver Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouveragreement.ca/TheAgreement.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316205956/http://www.vancouveragreement.ca/TheAgreement.htm |archivedate=2005-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBA also received support from Bell, VanCity, the Canadian Housing and Mortgage Corporation and the Vancouver Regional Construction Association. Building Opportunities with Business oversaw the use of the legacy funds, sourced labor and supported the inner city residents with training and aid while the VRCA oversaw the training of residents. Though the Olympic Village was widely criticized for going over budget, in a 2008 report to the City prepared by BOB the creation of 120 jobs with procurement closer to $50 million is cited. The report also admits that tracking the actual economic activity from the development was difficult and that the procurement is not exact. Regardless of the difficulty tracking procurement and the fact that the project went over budget the CBA is widely considered to be a success.

President [[Macky Sall]] has taken some significant efforts to combat corruption in [[Senegal]], including the establishment of several anti-corruption agencies, such as the Ministry of the Promotion of Good Governance and the reactivated Court of Repression of Economic and Financial Crime.

The '''Danube Swabians''' ({{lang-de|{{Audio|Donauschwaben.ogg|Donauschwaben}}}}) is a collective term for the German-speaking population who lived in various countries of southeastern Europe, especially in the [[Danube]] River valley. Most were descended from 18th-century immigrants recruited as colonists to repopulate the area after the expulsion of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The Danube Swabians are the most recently formed distinct line of ethnic German people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Josef Volkmar |last=Senz |title=Geschichte der Donau-Schaeben: Von den Anfängen bis zur Gegenwart |location=Munich |publisher=Amalthea |year=1987 |page=dust jacket}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are made up of [[ethnic Germans]] from many former and present-day countries: [[Hungarian Germans|Germans of Hungary]]; [[Satu Mare Swabians]]; the [[Banat Swabians]]; and the [[Ethnic groups of Vojvodina#Germans|Vojvodina Germans]] in Serbia's [[Vojvodina]], and [[Croatia]]'s [[Slavonia]] (especially in the [[Osijek]] region). They called themselves ''Schwowe'' in a Germanized spelling or "Shwoveh" in an English spelling; in the singular first person, they identified as a ''Schwob'' or a ''Shwobe''.  The [[Carpathian Germans]] and [[Transylvanian Saxons]] are not included within the Danube Swabian group.

This group of people had particular challenges in World War II, when the Axis powers, including Nazi Germany, overran many of the nations where these ethnic Germans were long settled. They were first favored, yet moved from their homes, and as the war progressed and Nazi Germany in particular needed more soldiers, the men were conscripted. Many atrocities took place during and after the war, from the complicated allegiances and the brutality of the Nazis. In the long years since, German-speaking populations have re-established in the new nations formed in the early 1990s after the fall of the communist bloc.

== History ==
[[File:DSMaennertracht.jpg|thumb|right|Danube Swabian men's ''[[tracht]]'', from the historic house of the parents of [[Stefan Jäger]], Hatzfeld ([[Jimbolia]]), [[Banat#Romanian Banat|Romanian Banat]].]]

=== Origins===
Beginning in the 12th century, German [[merchants]] and [[miners]] began to settle in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] at the invitation of the Hungarian monarchy (''see [[Ostsiedlung]]''). Although there were significant colonies of [[Carpathian Germans]] in the [[Spiš]] mountains and [[Transylvanian Saxons]] in [[Transylvania]], German settlement throughout the rest of the kingdom had not been extensive until this time.

During the 17th-18th centuries, warfare between the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] devastated and depopulated much of the lands of the Danube valley, referred to geographically as the [[Pannonian plain]]. The [[Habsburgs]] ruling [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]] at the time resettled the land with people of various ethnicities recruited from the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] of the Habsburgs, including [[Magyars]], [[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]], [[Croats]], [[Serbs]], [[Romanians]], [[Ukrainians]], and Germanic settlers from [[Swabia]], [[Hesse]], Palatinate, Baden, [[Franconia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Austria]], and [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. Despite differing origins, the new immigrants were all referred to as [[Swabians]] by their neighbor Serbs, Hungarians, and Romanians. The [[Bačka]] settlers called themselves ''Schwoweh,'' the plural of ''Schwobe'' in the [[polyglot]] language that evolved there. The majority of them boarded boats in [[Ulm]], Swabia, and traveled to their new destinations down the [[Danube River]] in boats called [[Ulm boxes|''Ulmer Schachteln'']]. The Austro-Hungarian Empire had given them funds to build their boats for transport.

=== Settlement ===
[[Image:Workshop of Martin van Meytens Kaiserin Maria Theresia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maria Theresa]]]]
The first wave of resettlement came after the Ottoman Turks were gradually being forced back after their defeat at the [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683. The settlement was encouraged by nobility, whose lands had been devastated through warfare, and by military officers including [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] and [[Claudius Mercy]]. Many Germans settled in the [[Bakony Mountains|Bakony]] (''Bakonywald'') and [[Vertes Mountains|Vértes]] (''Schildgebirge'') mountains north and west of [[Lake Balaton]] (''Plattensee''), as well as around the town [[Buda]] (''Ofen''), now part of [[Budapest]]. The area of heaviest German colonization during this period was in the [[Swabian Turkey]] (''Schwäbische Türkei''), a triangular region between the Danube River, Lake Balaton, and the [[Drava]] (''Drau'') River. Other areas settled during this time by Germans were [[Pécs]] (''Fünfkirchen''), [[Satu Mare]] (''Sathmar''), and south of [[Mukachevo]] (''Munkatsch'').

After the Habsburgs annexed the [[Banat]] area from the Ottomans in the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] (1718), the government made plans to resettle the region to restore farming. It became known as the [[Banat of Temesvár]] (''Temeschwar''/''Temeschburg''), as well as the [[Bačka]] (''Batschka'') region between the Danube and [[Tisza]] (''Theiss'') rivers. Fledgling settlements were destroyed during another Austrian-Turkish war (1737–1739), but extensive colonization continued after the suspension of hostilities.

The late 18th-century resettlement was accomplished through private and state initiatives. After [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] assumed the throne as [[Queen of Hungary]] in 1740, she encouraged vigorous colonization on crown lands, especially between Timișoara and the Tisza. The Crown agreed to permit the Germans to retain their language and religion (generally [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]). The German farmers steadily redeveloped the land: drained marshes near the Danube and the Tisza, rebuilt farms, and constructed roads and canals. Many Danube Swabians served on Austria's [[Military Frontier]] (''Militärgrenze'') against the Ottomans. Between 1740 and 1790, more than 100,000 Germans immigrated to the Kingdom of Hungary.

The [[Napoleonic Wars]] ended the large-scale movement of Germans to the Hungarian lands, although the colonial population increased steadily and was self-sustaining through [[Rate of natural increase|natural increase]]. Small daughter-colonies developed in [[Slavonia]] and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. After the creation of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1867, Hungary established a policy of [[Magyarization]] whereby minorities, including the Danube Swabians, were induced by political and economic means to adopt the [[Magyar people|Magyar]] language and culture.

Beginning in 1893, Banat Swabians began to move to [[Bulgaria]], where they settled in the village of [[Bardarski Geran]], [[Vratsa Province]], founded by [[Banat Bulgarians]] several years prior to that. Their number later exceeded 90 families. They built a separate Roman Catholic church in 1929 due to conflicts with the Bulgarian Catholics. Some of these Germans later moved to [[Tsarev Brod]], [[Shumen Province]], together with a handful of Banat Bulgarian families, as well as to another Banat Bulgarian village, [[Gostilya]], [[Pleven Province]].

After the treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain|Saint-Germain]] (1919) and [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]] (1920) following [[World War I]], the Banat was divided between [[Romania]], [[Yugoslavia]], and [[Hungary]]; Bačka was divided between [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Hungary]]; and Satu Mare went to Romania. Before [[World War II]], the biggest populations of Germans in the [[Vojvodina]] were at [[Hodschag]], [[Werbass]], and [[Apatin]].

There were approximately two million ethnic Danube Swabians in the region before World War II. In Romania, census of 1930 recorded 745,421 Germans; Hungarian Census of 1933 recorded 477,153; and Yugoslavian Census of 1921, 513,472. German estimations from the interwar period place those estimations at 850,000; 600,000 and 620,000 for Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia respectively.&lt;ref name="Paikert2012"&gt;{{cite book|first=G.C. |last=Paikert |title=The Danube Swabians: German Populations in Hungary, Rumania and Yugoslavia, and Hitler’s impact on their Patterns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWL_CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=3|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-011-9717-5|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1920 and especially after World War II, many Danube Swabians migrated to the [[United States]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[Austria]], [[Australia]], and [[Argentina]]. Some of them, descending from French-speaking or linguistically mixed families from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], had maintained the French language for some generations, as well as an ethnic identity, later referred to as [[Banat French]], ''Français du Banat.'' They were resettled in [[France]] around 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.memoria.ro/francais/articles_en_francais/de_l_squote_ouest_a_l_squote_est_et_de_l_squote_est_a_l_squote_ouest_:_les_avatars_identitaires_des_francais_du_banat/1642/ |first=Smaranda |last=Vultur |title=De l’Ouest à l’Est et de l’Est à l’Ouest : les avatars identitaires des Français du Banat |conference=la conférence d'histoire orale "Visibles mais pas nombreuses : les circulations migratoires roumaines" |location=Paris |year=2001 |language=French |trans-title=From West to East and From East to West: the identity avatars of the French of Banat |accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 much of Yugoslavia was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded and occupied]] by [[Nazi Germany]] as part of the Second World War, and in the German-occupied Banat, they granted the Swabian minority superior status over the other ethnic groups in the Yugoslav population. The [[Baranja]] and [[Bačka]] Swabians reverted to Hungary, to their general disappointment.&lt;ref name="Tomasevichpg?"&gt;[[#refTomasevich1975|Tomasevich 1975]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Danube Swabians were already under heavy Nazi influence by that time and served as the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[fifth column]] during the invasion of Yugoslavia, although many served in the royal Yugoslav army in the brief war against the Nazis in April 1941.&lt;ref name="Tomasevich II"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tomasevich |first=Jozo |title=War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945: Occupation and Collaboration |volume=2 |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-8047-3615-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fqUSGevFe5MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=occupation+and+collaboration&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Tno_TfPsGsjtsgbL3ZXUBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Independent State of Croatia]] (1941–1945), a fascist [[puppet state]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-1413183/Independent-State-of-Croatia Independent State of Croatia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005456 |title=Axis Invasion of Yugoslavia |encyclopedia=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; created within Axis-occupied [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], was home to 182,000 Danube Swabian ethnic Germans (who were called ''[[Volksdeutsche|Folksdojčeri]]'' in [[Croatian language|Croatian]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8d2409V9tEC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor:Stevan+inauthor:K+inauthor:Pavlowitch&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=BOOKS |last=Pavlowitch |first=Stevan K. |title=Hitler's New Disorder |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Danube Swabian minority were granted the separate autonomous region of [[Banat (1941-1944)|Banat]] within German-occupied [[Serbia (1941-1944)|Serbia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Johann |last=Böhm |author-link=Johann Böhm (historian) |title=Die deutschen Volksgruppen im Unabhängigen Staat Kroatien und im serbischen Banat.

They actively participated in the sometimes brutal repression of Yugoslav Partisans and their suspected sympathizers, including 69,000 Jewish Jugoslavs.&lt;ref name="Tomasevich II" /&gt;

The local collaborationist authorities were forced to make it illegal to draft Danube Swabians. However, of the approximately 300,000-strong Danube Swabian minority in occupied Yugoslavia (182,000 in the [[Independent State of Croatia|NDH]], 350,000 in [[Vojvodina]]), 500,000 in [[Romania]] and 500,000 in [[Hungary]], approximately 100,000 eventually entered service in various German and Axis military organizations, most notably in the two locally formed [[Waffen-SS]] volunteer divisions, the [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen|7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division ''Prinz Eugen'']], and the [[22nd SS Volunteer Cavalry Division Maria Theresia|22nd SS Volunteer Cavalry Division ''Maria Theresa'']] (which was made-up of Hungarian Danube Swabians).

The 7th SS ''Prinz Eugen'' was one of the most infamous [[SS]] units of [[World War II]], being principally engaged in fighting the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]]. It was responsible for the massacre of tens of thousands of Yugoslav civilians, as well as brutal reprisals resulting in the desolation of entire areas.&lt;ref name="Tomasevich II" /&gt; The division became notorious for its numerous atrocities against the Yugoslav civilian population, particularly during the battles of the [[Battle of the Neretva|Neretva]] and [[Battle of the Sutjeska|Sutjeska]] (1943), in which all captured prisoners and the wounded were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN157181504X&amp;id=63tr7z2356sC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=prince+eugen+division&amp;sig=pKItiXqYZ8L3ervCjm-1tu7GR3g |last=Wolff |first=Stefan |title=German minorities in Europe: Ethnic Identity and Cultural Belonging |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2000 |isbn=978-1571817389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these military units were initially formed as volunteer units,&lt;ref name="Tomasevich II" /&gt; SS officials ultimately imposed conscription under the dubious legal pretext that occupied Serbia was ''deutsches Hoheitsgebiet'', and the archaic ''Tiroler Landsturmordung'' (Tyrol General Levy Act) of 1872 was invoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George H. |last=Stein |title=The Waffen-SS, Hitler's Elite Guard at War 1939-1945 |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1966 |page=172 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Waffen_SS.html?id=-KEtPlNQJNgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th SS ''Prinz Eugen'' was formed as a volunteer unit, but historians{{who|date=May 2017}} have demonstrated that later in the war, the local German authorities of [[Banat (1941–1944)|Banat]] came under significant pressure from the German authorities. Essentially, coercion was used to recruit more troops. Guenther Reinecke, chief of the ''Hauptamt SS-Gericht'' (SS legal office) wrote to [[Himmler]] that the ''Prinz Eugen'' was "no longer an organization of volunteers, that on the contrary, the ethnic Germans from Serbian Banat were drafted, to a large extent under threat of punishment by the local German leadership, and later by the SS ''Ergänzungsamt''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George H. |last=Stein |title=The Waffen-SS, Hitler's Elite Guard at War 1939-1945 |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1966 |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1941 and 1943, a total of 2,150 ethnic German Bulgarian citizens were transferred to Germany as part of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Heim ins Reich]]'' policy. These included 164 Banat Swabians from Bardarski Geran and 33 from Gostilya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Banatskite bǎlgari: istorijata na edna malcinstvena obštnost vǎv vremeto na nacionalnite dǎržavi |last=Njagulov |first=Blagovest |year=1999 |location=Sofia |publisher=Paradigma |language=Bulgarian |chapter=Banatskite bǎlgari v Bǎlgarija |isbn=954-9536-13-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, a joint advance of the Yugoslav Partisans, and the Soviet [[Red Army]] saw the liberation of northern areas of German-occupied Yugoslavia, which were home to the Danube Swabian minority. In Yugoslavia in particular, with many exceptions, the Danube Swabian minority "collaborated . . . with the occupation".&lt;ref name="Tomasevich II" /&gt; Consequently, on November 21, 1944 the Presidium of the [[AVNOJ]] (the Yugoslav parliament) declared the ethnic German minority in Yugoslavia collectively hostile to the Yugoslav state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRamet2006|Ramet 2006]], p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The AVNOJ Presidium issued a decree that ordered the government confiscation of all property of [[Nazi Germany]] and its citizens in Yugoslavia, persons of ethnic German nationality (regardless of citizenship), and collaborators. The decision acquired the force of law on February 6, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTomasevich1969|Tomasevich 1969]], p. 115, 337.&lt;/ref&gt; The many reasons for this announcement are still inaccessible to historians, but revenge against the traitorous activity of the ethnic German minority and the expropriation of Swabian agricultural lands to facilitate collectivization in Yugoslavia appears to have been the prime reasons.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Janjetović |first=Zoran |title=Between Hitler and Tito.

During the [[Nuremberg trials]], a photograph of SS troopers (of low rank) decapitating a Yugoslav civilian with a woodsman's axe was shown. When asked to account for the atrocities of the 7th SS, the SS Oberstgruppenführer [[Paul Hausser]] (second in command of the SS) said that the division was composed primarily of Yugoslav ethnic Germans, many trained (under conscription) in the pre-war royal Yugoslav army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George H. |last=Stein |title=The Waffen-SS, Hitler's Elite Guard at War 1939-1945 |publisher=Cornell University |year=1984 |orig-year=1966 |page=274 |isbn=0-8014-9275-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of about 100,000 Danube Swabians who served in the various SS units, approximately 29,000 were killed. This total includes 2,000 POWs from the 7th SS ''Prinz Eugen'' who were summarily executed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] Yugoslav troops as Yugoslav citizens collaborating with the enemy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

During the Second World War, many ethnic Germans sent the youngest and the oldest of their families to Germany. From 1945–48, many ethnic Germans in [[Hungary]] were dispossessed and expelled to [[Allied-occupied Germany]] under the [[Potsdam]] agreement. In the [[Bačka]], which had been part of [[Hungary]] from 1941, Schwowisch villages were emptied forcibly in March 1945. The old and the young were imprisoned in camps in several villages of  Vojvodina (in modern Serbia) including [[Gakovo]], [[Kruševlje]], [[Rudolfsgnad]] (Knićanin), [[Molin, Serbia|Molidorf]] (Molin), [[Bački Jarak]], and [[Sremska Mitrovica]], and two villages in the Slavonia region of Yugoslavia (now part of Croatia), [[Krndija]], [[Valpovo]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Those able to work were used as slave labor throughout the countryside. On March 1, 1946 there was a proposal to expel 130,388 interned Yugoslav ethnic Germans under the Potsdam Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Lt.-Gen. Avsich, Yugoslav Military Mission, Berlin to the Allied Control Commission. Foreign Office 1032/2284.&lt;/ref&gt;  This proposal was turned down but provides a good estimate of the number of Shwovish internees. Many thousands were forcibly removed by cattle cars to [[Russia]] as Allied "war reparations", being put to work as slave labor in [[Siberia]]n coal mines and elsewhere until 1949, when the program was shut down. The conditions were poor, and about half of those sent to Russia died from malnutrition or disease.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In Yugoslavia in 1941, most ethnic Germans had their land confiscated and some were stripped of their citizenship by the new communist government. They faced summary executions, massacres, deportations.  They were rounded up en masse, and some were sent to concentration and labor camps,{{where|date=May 2017}} where they died in considerable numbers. About 27,000 - 37,000 women aged 18–40 were sent to the Soviet Union to perform forced labor. In addition, 35,000-40,000 Swabian children under age sixteen were separated from their parents and force into prison camps and re-education orphanages.  Many were adopted by Serbian Partisan families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Black|first=Monica |date=Spring–Summer 2013 |title=Expellees Tell Tales: Partisan Blood Drinkers and the Cultural History of Violence after World War II|url=|journal=History and Memory|volume=25 |number=1| pages=77–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of a pre-war population of about 350,000 ethnic Germans in the [[Vojvodina]], the 1958 census revealed 32,000 left. Officially, Yugoslavia denied the forcible starvation and killing of their Schwowisch populations, but reconstruction of the death camps reveals that of the 170,000 Danube Swabians interned from 1944 to 1948, about 50,000 died of mistreatment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  Since only families with the very young (under three), very old, and mothers were interned and starved, many others were unaccounted for in slave labor settings throughout the countryside and in Russia; but their death rates were probably much lower. The Germans in Romania were not deported but were instead dispersed within [[Romania]].

==Since 1990==
Many left Romania for [[West Germany]] between 1970–90, and this trend increased in 1990.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Since the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] and the formation of new nations with new borders, the forces for movement of people among European nations have changed. [[End of communism in Hungary (1989)|Hungary]] joined the [[European Union]] and travel between nations became simpler. From 2001 to 2011, the number of those identifying as German in Hungary increased sharply, comparing the census tables from the two years. Explanations for the increase seem complex, including the willingness of citizens to claim the ethnic identity.

== Culture ==
[[File:DSFrauentracht.jpg|thumb|left|Danube Swabian women's [[tracht]], from the historic house of the parents of Stefan Jäger, Hatzfeld (Jimbolia), [[Banat#Romanian Banat|Romanian Banat]].]] Prior to the First World War, the Swabians were the largest ethnic group to assimilate into Hungarian society, seconded by the Galician Jews and the Slovaks.  They were first and foremost Catholics, peasants thereafter, and thirdly loyal subjects to Kaiser Franz Joseph.  But a distinct Hungarian Swabian ethno-national consciousness didn't develop until the spread of Romantic Nationalism in the late nineteenth century.

For the greater portion of their history, the Danube Swabian did not share a cultural identity. The term Swabian has its roots in the first wave a German-speaking immigrants from Swabia to re-settle southern Hungary after the expulsion of the Ottomans in 1689.  However, it came to encompass all German-speaking people who followed in migrations from across the Holy Roman Empire in the eighteenth and nineteenth century.  The term ''Swabian'' was not originally a self-proclaimed identity of a singular people but a term ascrided by Magyar lords to refer to German-speaking Catholic peasants, tavern keepers, and poor artisans.  For the most part Swabians lived in villages, had few privileges, and no developed intellectual layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szelényi|first=Balázs A.|date=August 2007|title=From Minority to Übermensch: The Social Roots of Ethnic Conflict in the German Diaspora of Hungary, Romania and Slovakia|url=|journal=Past &amp; Present,|volume=No. 196|pages= 215–251}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1930 Hungary 55.4% of the total Swabian population were engaged in agriculture; 28.8% in industry, crafts, commerce, or transport; and 3.1% were in state administration.  The rest were employed in the service sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= |title=The Statistical Situation of the Germans in the Trianon Treaty Reduced Territories of Hungary|last=Kovacs|first=Alajos|location=Budapest |year=1936|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- is a newspaper of 1936 involved here? any idea of its name?  --&gt;

The Danube Swabian culture is a melting pot of southern German regional [[customs]], with a large degree of Balkan and mostly Hungarian influence. This is especially true of the food, where [[paprika]] is heavily employed, which led to the German nickname for Danube Swabians as ''Paprikadeutsche''. The architecture is neither Southern German nor Balkan but is unique to itself. The houses, often made of stamped mud and straw walls or mud bricks, are ubiquitous throughout the [[Vojvodina]] region. [[Georg Weifert]] was responsible for developing one of the most famous beers in the Serbia/Yugoslavia region and later became an important banker and politician in [[Belgrade]] (his image currently features on the [[Serbs|Serbian]] 1000 dinar note).[[File:1000RSD front.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Georg Weifert]] on the 1000 [[Serbian dinar]] bill.]]

=== Language ===
The Danube Swabian language is only nominally [[Swabian German|Swabian]] (''Schwowisch'', as it was referred to locally). In reality, it contains elements or many dialects of the original German settlers, mainly [[Swabian German|Swabian]], [[Franconian languages|Franconian]], [[Austro-Bavarian language|Bavarian]], [[Pfälzisch language|Pfälzisch]], [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], and [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]], as well as Austro-Hungarian administrative and [[military jargon]]. Loanwords from [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Serbian or Croatian language|Serbian]], or [[Romanian language|Romanian]] are especially common regionally regarding cuisine and agriculture, but also regarding [[Clothing|dress]], politics, place names, and sports. Other cultures of influence include [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] (for communist concepts), [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ([[Hambar]]), [[English language|English]] (for [[association football|football]]), and general [[Balkan]] and [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] loanwords like ''Kukuruts'' (corn). The plural of loanwords is in most cases formed in the Shwovish way. Conjunctions and adverbs from the respective contact languages may be integrated as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/events/lingo/papers/michaela.bentz.pdf |last=Bentz |first=Michaela |year=2008 |title=German as a Minority Language: The "Swabians" in the Danubian States and their Language(s) |editor-last=Kokkonidis |editor-first=Miltiadis |conference=Proceedings of LingO 2007 |pages=20–26 |publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many German words used by speakers of Danube Swabian dialects may sound archaic. To the ear of a Standard German speaker, the Danube Swabian dialect sounds like what it is: a mix of southwestern German dialects from the 18th century with many strange words from other languages. Due to relative isolation and differing proximities to nearby German speakers ([[Austrians]] and [[Transylvanian Saxons]]), the language varies considerably, with speakers able to distinguish inhabitants of neighboring villages by the words they use for such things as [[marmalade]] (''Leckwaar'' and ''Schleckle'' being two variants), or by how many (usually Hungarian) loanwords they employ.This even applied to verb conjugations. For example, the German verb "haben" was conjugated as "han" in Sankt Hubert and as "hava" In Mramorak, although both were in Banat.&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Michael, personal experience with native speakers from each town&lt;/ref&gt; Herman Ruediger, a German sociologist, reports that in his trips throughout the [[Bačka]] in the 1920s, he noted that Danube Swabians from widely separated villages had to use standard high German to communicate with each other because their speech was so different. This was particularly true for towns like [[Esseg]] (Osijek) where Shwoveh were thoroughly with majority Croatians.&lt;ref&gt;Ruediger, H. (1931) Die Donauschwaben in der südslawischen Bačka, Schriften des Deutschen Ausland-Instituts Stuttgart. Reihe A. Bd. 28. Stuttgart, 1931&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, the ethnic Germans of Esseg were so thoroughly assimilated with Croatia that their Shwovish or 'Essekerish' could only be understood by those who also spoke Croatian or Serbian.

===Naming===

As is the custom in Hungary (as well as southern Germany), Danube Swabians often put the [[surname]] first, especially when writing, for example ''Butscher Jakob'' (see photo of memorial). Danube Swabian villages tend to have relatively few family names as the villagers stem from only a few families, but usually the same family name does not appear in more than a couple of villages, meaning that there are many Danube Swabian family names. The names come from throughout southern Germany, from assimilated Hungarians, and occasionally from Balkan and Italian origins. There are usually no [[middle name]]s, but often double first names, if a distinction can be made. The variety of first names is few, since children were usually named after grandparents or godparents. Popular names for women include: Anna, Barbara, Christina, Elisabeth, Katharina, Magdalena, Maria, Sophia, Theresia, and many two-name combinations thereof. Popular names for men include: Adam, Anton, Christian, Franz, Friedrich, Georg, Gottfried, Heinrich, Jakob, Johann, Konrad, Ludwig, Mathias, Michael, Nikolaus, Peter, Philipp (or Filipp), and Stefan (or Stephan). With so few names in villages, other modifiers or nicknames were almost always used to distinguish people. The modifiers were often size related (e.g., "Kleinjohann" or "Little Johann"), occupation related ("Tischler Stefan" or the "carpenter Stefan"), or location related (usually by prefixing the streetname).

== Coat of arms ==
[[File:StemaBanat.png|thumb|right|Coat of arms of the [[Banat Swabians]] created by Hans Diplich in 1950.]]
A [[coat of arms]] designed in 1950 by [[Hans Diplich]] has been adopted by many Danube Swabian cultural organizations. Its blazon is "Parti per fess wavy 1 Or, an eagle displayed couped Sable langued Gules; 2 parti per fess Argent and Vert, a fortress Argent roofed and turreted Gules surmounted with Sun and Crescent waning Or; chief wavy Azure".

It depicts:
*a black eagle representing the protection of the [[Emperor of Austria]];
*a blue ribbon representing the [[Danube River]];
*a crescent moon representing the waning of [[Islam]]ic influence through the withdrawal of the [[Ottoman Turks]];
*the Sun representing both [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] and the light of [[Christianity]]; and
*a fortress representing the fortified city of Temeschburg ([[Timișoara]]).

'''''Earth Abides''''' is a 1949 [[post-apocalyptic]] [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[George R. Stewart]]. It tells the story of the fall of civilization from deadly disease and its rebirth. The story was set in the United States in the 1940s in [[Berkeley, California]] and told by a character, Isherwood Williams, who emerges from isolation in the mountains to find almost everyone dead.

''Earth Abides'' won the inaugural [[International Fantasy Award]] in 1951. It was included in [[Locus (magazine)|''Locus'' Magazine's]] list of best All Time Science Fiction in 1987 and 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/LocusATNomList.html |title=The Locus Index to SF Awards: Locus All-Time Poll Nominees List |author=Locus Magazine |accessdate=2008-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815034424/http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/LocusATNomList.html |archivedate=2010-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a nominee to be entered into the [[Prometheus Award|Prometheus Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfs.org/hof_nominees.htm|title=Prometheus Hall of Fame Nominees|author=Libertarian Futurist Society| accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1950, it was adapted for the [[CBS]] radio program ''[[Escape (radio program)|Escape]]'' as a two-part drama starring [[John Dehner]].

==Plot==

==="Part I: World Without End"===
While working on his graduate thesis in geography in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains, Ish is bitten by a [[rattlesnake]]. As he heals from the bite, taking refuge in a cabin, he gets sick with a disease that looks like [[measles]], and he moves in and out of consciousness (at one point being approached by two men who flee in fright). He recovers and makes his way back to civilization, only to discover that it has utterly collapsed -most people had died from the same disease. He goes to his home in Berkeley. In the city near his home Ish meets few human survivors – a man drinking himself to death, a couple who seem to have lost their sanity, and a teenage girl who flees from him as someone dangerous. He comes across a dog (a beagle bitch), friendly and eager to join him.  The dog, which he names Princess, swiftly adopts Ish as her new master and sticks by him for much of the book. He sets out on a cross-country tour, traveling all the way to [[New York City]] and back, scavenging for food and fuel as he goes. As he travels, he finds small pockets of survivors, but has doubts about humanity's ability to survive the loss of civilization.

He returns to his home in California after reading [[Ecclesiastes]] (and realizing he had been throwing his life away), to find a woman, Emma (Em), living nearby.  They agree to consider themselves married and have children. They are gradually joined by other survivors. Over time the electricity fails and the comforts of civilization recede. As the children grow, Ish tries to instill basic academics by teaching reading, writing, arithmetic, and geography, but he is largely unsuccessful due to a lack of interest by the others.

Many children are born in these years and among them is Joey, Ish's youngest and favorite son. Joey is very similar in nature to Ish, as he demonstrates innate intelligence and a curiosity about the world before the epidemic. This leads Ish to believe that Joey is the key to the future.

==="Part II: The Year 22"===

Twenty-two years later, the community flourishes. The younger generation adapts easily to the more traditional world. They come to have a better grasp of the natural world than the adults, and when running water fails, the younger generation comes to the rescue, knowing where flowing streams may be found. Ish turns his attention from ecology to his newly forming society. One thing that he notices is that the children are becoming very [[superstitious]]. One day Ish asks for his [[hammer]], an antique miner's tool he found in the mountains, which he habitually carries around, and finds the children are afraid to touch it. It is a symbol for them of the old times. The long-dead "Americans" are now like gods—and Ish is too.

In the Year 22, the older boys return from a cross country trip with a stranger named Charlie, who exposes the tribe to typhoid fever. The disease kills many, including Ish's beloved son Joey.  Through his despair, Ish is forced to face the future with a different set of expectations and hopes.  His ambition to restore civilization to its original state is replaced by a more modest, practical one to simply convey a few basic survival skills.

As years go by, the community begins to grow [[corn]] and make and play with bows and arrows. Ish presides at meetings, his hammer being a [[Status symbol|symbol of his status]]. He is given respect, but his ideas are ignored by the younger men.

==="Part III: The Last American"===

Ish spends most of his elderly life in a fog, unaware of the world. Superstition has set in; the tribe has reverted to a traditional lifestyle, hunting with dogs and bow and arrow. Occasionally the fog in his mind lifts. During one such time, he finds himself aware of his great-grandson Jack, who stands before him. Jack shows him that the bow and arrow have become more reliable than the [[gun]], whose [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]] do not always work. Ish realizes that the former civilization is now completely gone. But he also wonders if the new world is that much worse off than the old world, and finds himself hoping that the new world will not rebuild civilization and its mistakes.

==Characters==
''Isherwood Williams'' (Ish) is a [[graduate student]] at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], studying the [[geography]] of an area in the mountains, somewhere in California.  He is sometimes referred to in the book as "The Last American."  Ish becomes the leader of the community, aka "the tribe", he believes due to his intellect.  His nickname, Ish, is an obvious reference to [[Ishi]], the "last Wild Indian."  Ish is also the word for "man" in Biblical Hebrew.

''Emma'' (Em) is a woman who Isherwood meets in his hometown. The author may have been taking a chance with this character, who is, at least partially, African-American,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/74664|title=The Box Of Paperbacks Book Club: Earth Abides by George R. Stewart (1949)|author=Keith Phipps|accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Isherwood is white; when the book was written, [[interracial marriages]] were heavily discouraged in American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lostbooks.org/reviews/1998-06-11-1.html |title=Lost Book Archives, Earth Abides by George R.

Em becomes the community's mother, letting it grow as it will, but stepping in to help when no one else is filling the leadership role. She was the adult while others panicked, and Ish thought of her as the "Mother of Nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |pages=295–299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ezra'' meets Emma and Ish while traveling through Berkley, he was a former liquor salesman and immigrant from Yorkshire, England. They liked him, but feared the complications of a [[love triangle]], so they encouraged him to leave. He returned with Molly and Jean, his [[Polygamy|wives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |pages=142–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ish values Ezra as a good judge of people, saying "Ezra knew people, Ezra liked people."

''George'' is a carpenter by trade. George is not intellectually intelligent but becomes a Jack-of-all-trades able to build, repair or maintain the limited infrastructure of the small community.

''Evie'' is a "half grown girl" who Ezra found living "in squalor and solitude."  She appears to have little mind left, if she ever had one, and everyone cares for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |page=144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evie grows into an attractive young woman but the tribe has a rule, that as the children grow no one will marry her—she wouldn't understand, and her mental condition could possibly be hereditary.

''Joey'' is the youngest son of Ish and Em. Of all the children in the Tribe, he is the only one that truly understands the academic skills that Ish tries to teach — geometry, reading, geography. He dies during the typhoid fever outbreak.

''Charlie'' is a stranger who arrives from Los Angeles after two of the "boys" (the second generation) make a scouting expedition in a refurbished Jeep to see what is left of America. Immediately upon his arrival Ish and Ezra become suspicious about Charlie and the type of person he might be. Their suspicions are confirmed a day later when Charlie sets his eye on Evie. He also reveals to Ezra after drinking heavily that he has had many of [[Sexually transmitted infection|"Cupid's" diseases]]. Ish confronts Charlie about Evie, Charlie is disrespectful and challenges Ish's authority as leader. It is revealed that Charlie carries a concealed pistol and his behavior reveals himself as someone who was probably a violent criminal before the epidemic. As a result, Ish, Em, Ezra and George debate what to do about Charlie for the safety of the community, exile or execution. Charlie is the carrier of the typhoid epidemic that infects the community.

''Jack'' is Ish's great-grandson. Jack is confident, intelligent and a potential leader. Ish sees something of Joey in him. As Ish dies, he gives Jack his hammer.  (The hammer became an important symbol for "the tribe" over Ish's lifetime.)

==Major themes==

===Biological controls on population===
On the title page Stewart immediately starts with the theme, quoting [[Ecclesiastes]] 1:4 — "Men go and come, but earth abides." For the first half of ''Earth Abides'', George R. Stewart concentrates on a major theme for the book, that humans have no privileged place in nature and are not immune to nature's built-in [[population control]]s. The main character, an ecologist, states it plainly, "When anything gets too numerous it's likely to get hit by some plague".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |page=125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first page Stewart tells readers how contagion could bring the end very quickly for mankind:
::"If a killing type of virus strain should suddenly arise by [[mutation]]...it could, because of the rapid transportation in which we indulge nowadays, be carried to the far corners of the earth and cause the deaths of millions of people." W.M. Stanley, in Chemical and Engineering News, December 22, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few pages he makes it clear that basic biology applies to humans too: 
::"Some zoologists have even suggested a biological law: that the number of individuals in a species never remains constant, but always rises and falls—the higher the animal and the slower its breeding-rate, the longer its period of fluctuation[...]As for man, there is littler reason to think that he can in the long run escape the fate of other creatures, and if there is a biological law of flux and reflux, his situation is now a highly perilous one....Biologically, man has for too long a time been rolling an uninterrupted run of sevens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of smaller population ===
Reviewer [[Noel Perrin]] has pointed out that George R. Stewart had written two books before this, in which the main character was not a person, but "a natural force."  In ''[[Storm (novel)|Storm]]'' the main character is weather, and in ''Fire'', a [[forest fire]] takes center stage.&lt;ref name="go.galegroup"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Perrin | first = Noel | date = Spring 2003  | title = unlisted title | journal = American Scholar | volume =  | issue = 72.2| pages = 109| publisher = Gale | location =Gale Document Number: A101175935 | url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/start.do?p=LitRC&amp;u=wylrc_sheridanc  | accessdate = 2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, Stewart centers the first half of ''Earth Abides'' on the forces of [[natural selection|natural]] and [[artificial selection]]. In freeing the landscape from humans, half of the book is devoted to looking at how the world would change in their absence. Stewart chose to make his main human character an [[ecologist]], and sends him on a cross-country tour, to see what the world is like without people. As animals and plants no longer have humans taking care of them or controlling them, they are free to breed uncontrolled and to prey upon one another. The main character sees that some have been under humans so long that they are helpless in the face of change, while others are still able to adapt and survive. Stewart shows that humans have routinely influenced the lives of almost every plant and animal around them.

Another theme of the book is what happens to human skills as the population decreases. Reviewer [[Lionel Shriver]] points out this theme in an article about literature which features human extinction:
::But as Stewart tracks three post-plague generations, he vividly demonstrates that advanced civilisation depends on numbers. Reduce the race to the size of a small town and how many residents will remember how to make [[plastic]]? The last Americans plunder [[canned goods]] (with little respect for [[sell-by date]]s), and [[literacy]] atrophies; electrical and water systems break down. At length, the community reverts to its hunter-gatherer forebears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shriver  | first = Lionel  | date = June 10, 2002  | title = Population doomsday | journal = New Statesman | volume = 131 | issue = 4591| pages = 38| publisher = EBSCO Host Academic Search Premier  | location = | url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=6808391&amp;site=ehost-live  | accessdate = 2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart uses the second half of his book to show that, if humans are reduced to low numbers, it will be difficult for them to continue civilization as we know it. Reading becomes a casualty.

::The society is so small that the death of one member—a little boy named Joey—seems likely to determine for many generations to come whether the emerging society will or won't be literate...As Ish thinks of it, each new baby is a candle lit against the dark.&lt;ref name="go.galegroup" /&gt;

If skills and customs don't work in the new situation, these die out, or those holding them do. Children adapt naturally to the new situation, and immediately useful customs and skills are more interesting to them than reading and writing. The information in libraries is useless within a generation.

One custom that Stewart predicts could die out is racism. When there are fewer partners to choose from, mankind will not be able to afford to be too choosy in picking one's partner.

Another issue he brings up is how law and order will function, when the lawmakers, courts and enforcers are all gone. Even laws won't be immune to the pressure to survive. One of the characters in the book point out, "What laws?" when they have to determine the fate of an outsider. Stewart shows how people may come to worry about potential harm rather than justice when dealing with outsiders.

===Biblical theme: replenishing the Earth===
Having explored the [[Depopulation|depopulated]] Earth, Stewart shifts his thematic focus in part 2 and 3, from the biological theme of population crash to a biblical theme of populating the world.

A 1949 book review says that ''Earth Abides'' parallels two biblical stories that shows mankind spreading out and populating the world:
::...the dual themes are as old as [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]...Not a [[Deluge (mythology)|flood]] but a swift and deadly new disease wipes out all but a few of the human race. Ish (for "Isherwood") is the Noah of this "Great Disaster."  As material civilization begins to crumble, Ish gradually devolves into a kind of Adam who, inevitably, finds his Eve, Em (For "Emma"), a level-headed lady with Negro blood, and nature takes its time-worn course. Em is  hailed by Ish as "The Mother of Nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bell  | first = Eric T.  |date=December 1949  | title = Books: Earth Abides by George R. Stewart. Random House, Inc. New York | journal = Engineering and Science Monthly | volume = XIII | issue = 3| pages = 3–4| publisher = California Institute of Technology | location = Pasadena, California | url = http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/309/01/books.pdf  | accessdate = 2008-03-15|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart, who specialized in meanings of names, chose names in [[Hebrew]] that have appropriate meanings for the biblical theme; this couple who restart the human tribe are symbolically ''man'' and ''mother.'' In Stewart’s day, most Hebrew dictionaries stated that Ish means "man" (although a more accurate English equivalent is "participant"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/JHS/Articles/article_78.pdf|title=The Noun איש ('îš) in Biblical Hebrew: A Term of Affiliation |journal=Journal of Hebrew Scriptures | volume= 8|year=2008|author=David E. S. Stein|accessdate=2009-02-15|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Em means "mother".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proz.com/kudoz/501201|title=Mother, mom, -em, ima (translation glossary|author=Thijs van Dorssen|accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both terms figure prominently in the biblical story of Adam and Eve: Ish in Genesis 2:23, and Em in Genesis 3:20.

In addition to the [[Hebraic]] names in ''Earth Abides'', the story also has a symbol in common with biblical tradition—the snake. Ish encounters a rattlesnake; before this event he is part of a larger civilization. After it bites him, his world changes, just as the snake changes Adam's world in the ''Genesis'' story. Adam loses paradise, and Ish finds civilization dead.

Aside from the biblical origin of ''Ish'', there is another tale of the fall of civilization that George R. Stewart could have taken account of, the story of [[Ishi]], the last of his tribe, who lived at Berkeley, where Stewart later taught.
''Ish'' is very similar to ''[[Ishi]]'', and it also means "man", in the language of a man whose whole tribe was dead. Ishi's story parallels the ''Genesis'' and ''Earth Abides'' stories, telling of one who has to adapt to a changed world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfsite.com/11a/ea92.htm |title=George R. Stewart |accessdate=2007-06-12 |last=Dodds |first=Georges T |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
''Earth Abides'' fits into the "[[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]]" [[genre|subgenre]] of [[science fiction]]. It was published in 1949, four years after the end of World War II and in the earliest stages of the [[Cold War]] between the United States and the Soviet Union. While [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic fiction]] is now quite common, ''Earth Abides'' distinctly predates many similar well-known novels including ''[[Alas, Babylon]]'' (1959), ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]'' (1960), and ''[[The Last Ship (novel)|The Last Ship]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparencynow.com/aptable1.htm|title= False utopias of simulation and technology|author=Ken Sanes|accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1988). It is predated, however by ''[[The Last Man]]'' (1826), ''[[The Machine Stops]]'' (1909), ''[[The Scarlet Plague]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taint.org/2004/07/27/071602a.html |title=Justin Mason's Weblog, July 27, 2004: Post-Apocalyptic Fiction|author=Justin Mason| accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1912), and [[René Barjavel]]'s ''[[Ravage (novel)|Ashes, Ashes]]'' (''Ravage'', 1943), among others.

A common theme of post-apocalyptic works is, "What if the world we know no longer exists," and each of these books paints a different picture of the future.  ''Earth Abides'' explores such issues as family structure, education, the meaning and purpose of civilization, and the basic nature of humankind — especially in regard to religion, superstition, and custom. As it was written in the beginning years of the cold war, it lacks some common post-apocalyptic conventions found in later novels: there are no warlords or biker gangs (as in ''[[Mad Max]]''); there is no fear of atomic weapons or radiation, no mutants and no warring tribes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sffworld.com/brevoff/279.html|title=Official sffworld.com Book Review: Earth Abides by George Rippey Stewart (2006-06-06)|author=Rob L. Bedford|accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as in ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]''). When the main character in ''Earth Abides'' travels through the country, he notices little sign of there having been violence or civil unrest during the plague period. Many areas seem to have been evacuated, and only in or near hospitals are there large numbers of corpses.

==Reception==
&lt;!--- I need to get access to some late 40s and early 50s newspapers or to a university library to do this section. If anyone has the ability, feel free to work on this ---&gt;
According to WorldCat.org, there have been [http://worldcat.org/oclc/2205195?tab=editions#tabs 28 editions] of ''Earth Abides'' published in English. The book has been in print in every decade from 1949 to 2008.

[[James Sallis]], writing in 2003 in the ''[[Boston Globe]]'':
{{quote|This is a book, mind you, that I'd place not only among the greatest science fiction but among our very best novels. Each time I read it, I'm profoundly affected, affected in a way only the greatest art — [[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]], [[Matisse]] or [[Beethoven]] symphonies, say — affects me. Epic in sweep, centering on the person of Isherwood Williams, ''Earth Abides'' proves a kind of antihistory, relating the story of humankind backwards, from ever-more-abstract civilization to stone-age primitivism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grasslimb.com/sallis/GlobeColumns/globe.06.earth.html Sallis, James."''Earth Abides'': Stewart's dark eulogy for humankind," ''Boston Globe'', February 16. 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Astounding Science Fiction|''Astounding'']] reviewer [[P. Schuyler Miller]] identified the novel as one of the first regarding "a young and little understood science, the science of ecology." Miller praised Stewart for "the intricacy of detail with which he has worked out his problem in ecology" and for writing "quietly, with very few peaks of melodrama as seem necessary in much popular fiction."&lt;ref&gt;"Book Reviews", [[Astounding Science Fiction|''Astounding'']], October 1950, pp.129-30&lt;/ref&gt;

It was mentioned in a serious overview of modern science fiction, ''Contemporary Science Fiction'' by [[August Derleth]], in the January 1952 edition of ''College English''. Derleth called it an "excellent example" of the "utopian theme" of "rebuilding after a holocaust leaving but few survivors."

It was described as a persuasive answer to the question, "What is man," in the October, 1973 edition of ''Current Anthropology''. The article "Anthropology and Science Fiction" &lt;ref&gt;Stover, Leon. "Anthropology and Science Fiction." ''Current Anthropology'' 14:4(471-474).&lt;/ref&gt; examines the nature of Science Fiction and its relationship to understanding people. The magazine concluded of ''Earth Abides'' that it shows ..."man is man, be he civilized or tribal. Stewart shows us that a tribal hunting culture is just as valid and real to its members as civilization is to us."

In the ''American Quarter'' article ''California's Literary Regionalism'', Autumn 1955, George R. Stewart is seen as a "humanist in the old classical sense. His novels, ''Storm'', ''Fire'', ''East of the Giants'', ''Earth Abides'', demonstrate the complex interlocking of topography, climate, and human society; and their general tone is objective and optimistic."

==References to other works==
The book makes a reference to ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' and ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]''. Ish compares the situations within these books to what he is going through. He finds Robinson Crusoe less appealing, because "his religious preoccupations seemed boring and rather silly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |page=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He looks at the ship in the ''Swiss Family Robinson'' as an "infinite grab-bag from which at any time they might take exactly what they wanted,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |pages=90–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is similar to the situation of those living after the Great Disaster.

Stewart also mentions ''[[Ecclesiastes]]'' 1:4 in the title and theme: "Men go and come, but Earth abides".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=  |nopp=true|page=title page }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ethnic groups in Armenia''' is about the [[ethnic groups]] features of the [[population]] of [[Armenia]]. 

The demographic trends in modern Armenia during its history. While [[Armenians]] formed a consistent majority, [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] were historically the second largest population in the republic under [[Armenian SSR|Soviet rule]] (forming about 2.5% in 1989&lt;ref name="1989census"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php?reg=13 The All-Union Population Census of 1989] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104081804/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php?reg=13 |date=January 4, 2012 }}. ''Demoscope.ru''&lt;/ref&gt;). However, due to hostilities with neighboring Azerbaijan over the disputed region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] virtually all Azeris emigrated from Armenia. Conversely, Armenia received a large influx of Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan, thus giving Armenia a more homogeneous character. This forceful population exchange also affected the Christian [[Udi people]] of Azerbaijan, many of whom were perceived as Armenians due to close cultural ties between both peoples.&lt;ref name="udis"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Udis residing in Armenia has increased from 19 in 1989&lt;ref name="1989census" /&gt; to about 200 by 2006.&lt;ref name="udis" /&gt;

Additionally since independence, several other ethnic groups have emigrated especially [[Russians]] (who decreased from 51,555 persons in 1989&lt;ref name="1989census" /&gt; to 14,660 in 2001&lt;ref name="2001census"&gt;[http://docs.armstat.am/census/pdfs/51.pdf Information from the 2001 Armenian National Census]&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Ukrainians]] (8,341 in 1989&lt;ref name="1989census" /&gt; to 1,633 in 2001&lt;ref name="2001census" /&gt;),Armeno-Tat (? in ?&lt;ref name="?"/&gt;to? in?&lt;ref name="? census"/&gt;), [[Greeks]] (4,650 in 1989&lt;ref name="1989census" /&gt; to 1,176 in 2001&lt;ref name="2001census" /&gt;), and [[Belarusians]] (1,061 in 1989&lt;ref name="1989census" /&gt; to 160 in 2001&lt;ref name="minorities"&gt;Garnik Asatryan and Victoria Arakelova, ''[http://www.osce.org/documents/oy/2002/01/148_en.pdf The Ethnic Minorities of Armenia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110080044/http://www.osce.org/documents/oy/2002/01/148_en.pdf |date=January 10, 2006 }}'', Routledge, part of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt;). The numbers of [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] , [[Armeno-Tats]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] have remained consistent for the most part (though approximately 2,000 Assyrians have left Armenia between 1989&lt;ref name="1989census" /&gt; and 2001&lt;ref name="2001census" /&gt;). [[Georgians]] have also historically been counted among the largest ethnic groups in modern Armenia, though it is likely that their numbers have dropped substantially since the 1989 Soviet census when they numbered 1,364 persons.&lt;ref name="1989census" /&gt;

== Background ==
According to last census, ethnic minorities in [[Armenia]] consist of less than 3% of the population. Various sources suggest different numbers, and even some of the representatives of the ethnic minorities are not informed about exact numbers. However, migration waves from Armenia always included representatives of various ethnic minorities, and as their leaders suggest, migration will continue from Armenia despite considerable improvements in the economic and political situation in Armenia.

=== Azerbaijanis ===
{{main|Azerbaijanis in Armenia}}
[[File:Comparison table of armenian azeri kurdish population of armenia.jpg|thumb|280px|Comparison table of Armenian, Azerbaijani and Kurdish population of Armenia]]

The [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] community in [[Armenia]] in the 20th century, represented a large number but have been virtually non-existent since 1988–1991. Most Azerbaijanis fled the country as a result of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] and the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] estimates the current population of Azerbaijanis in Armenia to be somewhere between 30 and a few hundred persons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoi.net/file_upload/432_1163080631_pdf-2nd-sr-armenia.pdf Second Report Submitted by Armenia Pursuant to Article 25, Paragraph 1 of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]. Received on 24 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; with majority of them living in rural areas and being members of mixed couples (mostly mixed marriages), as well as elderly and sick. Most of them are also reported to have changed their names and maintain a low profile to avoid discrimination.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"&gt;[http://www.ecoi.net/file_upload/470_1162983398_3f5f27d14.pdf International Protection Considerations Regarding Armenian Asylum-Seekers and Refugees]. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Geneva: September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2003/27823.htm Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2003: Armenia] U.S. Department of State. Released 25 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kurds ===
{{main|Kurds in Armenia}}
The [[Kurds in Armenia]] are the largest ethnic and religious minority in the country.The [[Yazidi]]s are mostly ethnic [[Kurds]] who live in the west of [[Armenia]] and are adherents of the smallest of the three branches of [[Yazdânism]].There are also a small percentage of non-Yazidi Kurds in Armenia.

===Russians===
{{main|Russians in Armenia}}
Ethnic Russians are the second largest ethnic community in Armenia after the Yazidis, with their number at 14600. Even in the days of the [[Soviet Union]], the days of the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]], the country had the smallest percentage of Russians compared to the other 14 republics. Although some ethnic Russians left the country after independence, because of economic hardship and better opportunities, there is some flux of new ethnic Russians arriving for commercial considerations.

There are a number of Russian-language publications in the Republic, including the dailies ''"Golos Armenii"'', ''"Novoye Vremia"'' and ''"Respublika Armenia"'' and the weekly ''"Delovoi Expres"''.

The educational system also uses [[Russian language|Russian]] in many domains.

=== Assyrians ===
{{main|Assyrians in Armenia}}
Assyrians are a historic presence in Armenia from very ancient times. Assyrians are the third biggest minority in Armenia after the Yazidis and Russians. Their number is estimated at 5000. There has been a higher rate of intermarriage between the Assyrians and the Armenians.

According to the 2001 census, there are 3,409 Assyrians living in Armenia, and Armenia is home to some of the last surviving Assyrian communities outside the middle east. There were 6,000 Assyrians in Armenia before the breakup of [[USSR]], but because of Armenia's struggling economy, the population has been cut by half, as many have emigrated to Russian areas.

Assyrians are a Christian Semitic people, Aramaic speakers who are descendants of the ancient Assyrians and Babylonians

===Molokans===
The [[Molokans]] ({{lang-ru|Молока́не}}) are a religious sect, among Russian peasants ([[serfs]]), who broke away from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in the 1550s. They reject the [[Trinity]] as outlined by the [[Nicene Creed]], the Orthodox fasts, [[military service]], adhering to the [[Old Testament]] [[kosher]] dietary laws and do not eat pork, shellfish, or other [[unclean food]]s. They also refuse many accepted Christian practices, including water [[baptism]]. They claim to be the direct descendants of the ancient Armenian "[[Paulicians]]". They became known as the "[[Bogomils]]" of Thrace, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Serbia. 

Molokan means "milk drinkers" in Russian, as they drank milk instead of fasting from it on Orthodox Fasts. There are around 5,000 Molokans in Armenia. They encourage [[endogamy]].

=== Greeks ===
{{main|Greeks in Armenia}}
The [[Greeks in Armenia|Greeks of Armenia]] are mainly descendants of [[Pontic Greeks]], who originally lived along the shores of the [[Black Sea]].

=== Armeno-Tats ===
{{main|Armeno-Tats in Armenia}}
Christian Tats (Armenian:hay-tater) are a distinct group of Tat-speaking Armenians that historically populated eastern parts of the South Caucasus.

===Ukrainians===
{{main|Ukrainians in Armenia}}

The origin of the [[Ukrainians]] in [[Armenia]] goes back to the mid 19th century after the migration to [[South Caucasus|Transcaucasia]] “the [[Cossack]]s from [[Little Russia|Minor Russia]]” to seal the Empire’s Southern borders. The migrants worked mostly in agriculture.

===Jews===
{{main|Jews in Armenia}}
Jews in Armenia are ethnic / religious Jews living in Republic of Armenia. Their number is around 700. Although the contemporary relations between Israel and Armenia are normally good, some anti-Jewish sentiments are still present. The Jews have their religious leaders in Armenia headed by a Chief Rabbi and sociopolitical matters are run by the Jewish Council of Armenia.

===Udis===
The Udis (the self-name Udi, Uti) – are one of the most ancient native peoples of [[Caucasus]] as they are considered to be the descendants of the people of [[Caucasian Albania]]. 

Udis reside in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Armenia]]. In Armenia, they number around 200. 

The [[Udi language]] belongs to the Nakho-Dagestanian group of the Caucasian languages.
There are two primary dialects named Nij and Vartashen. [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]] languages are also spoken. 

Most Udis belong to the Orthodox Church. Centuries of life in the sphere of [[Persianate society|Perso-Islamic culture]] made a relevant impact on the Udi culture and mentality. This trace is noticeable in Udi folk traditions and the material culture.

Most Udis speak [[Udi language]] that is a member of the [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian language family]]. Udi is related to [[Lezgian language|Lezgian]] and [[Tabasaran language|Tabasaran]].

It is believed this was the main language of [[Caucasian Albania]], which stretched from south [[Dagestan]] to current day [[Azerbaijan]]. The language is spoken by about 5,000 people including in the villages of Debedavan, Bagratashen, Ptghavan, and Haghtanak in the [[Tavush]] province of [[Armenia]] and in the village of Zinobiani (Oktomberi) in the [[Kvareli]] district of the [[Kakheti]] province in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

Versions of Udi were written in [[Armenian alphabet]] and the [[Georgian alphabet]].

The '''Fox Club''' is one of the eight originally male-only [[final clubs]] at [[Harvard University]].

==History==
The Fox Club was founded in 1898 by a group of six undergraduate students. Originally known as the ''Digamma Club'', the name '''Fox''' and the Club’s symbol, a fox carrying the letter "F", grew from the similarity between the letter "F" and the archaic Greek character for "Digamma", which primarily signifies the number 6. The clubhouse has three floors that serve both the undergraduate and alumni membership, as well as an underground level where club members may invite guests. The clubhouse was built in 1906 and designed by [[Guy Lowell]], a prominent American architect who also designed the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Boston]] and the [[New York County Courthouse|New York State Supreme Court Building]]. The building is located on 44 John F. Kennedy Street in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and is a city historic landmark or otherwise protected property.

==All-male status==
In 2015, the club was one of the first of Harvard's final clubs to admit women, but in a less than full status by the club's [[Undergraduate education#United States system|undergraduate]] board. In an August 2016 vote by the club's graduate members,  nine women were given a provisional membership to become members. The provisional member status expired in June 2017 and male provisional members could reapply to continue as graduate members, but the female provisional members, who have since graduated, were not asked to reapply. As of July 2017, the club has reverted an all-male membership going forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krantz |first=Laura |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/07/06/nine-women-stripped-membership-harvard-club/jv88gpLMR0PVsOTs2VtQVL/story.html |title=Nine women stripped of membership in Harvard club |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2017-07-06 |accessdate=2017-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helen Kendrick Johnson''' (January 4, 1844 – January 3, 1917) was an  American writer, poet, and prominent activist opposing the [[women's suffrage]] movement.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/library/bio/blbiojohnsonhk.htm|title=Helen Kendrick Johnson About.com|last=Johnson Lewis|first=Jone|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Helen Kendrick Johnson was born in Hamilton, New York to her father, Asahel Clark Kendrick&lt;ref&gt;For a biography of A. C. Kendrick, see {{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Kendrick, Clark|year=1892}} See also [https://archive.org/details/anamericanschol01coopgoog An American Scholar: A Tribute to Asahel Clark Kendrick, 1809-1895] at archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt; a professor in Greek at [[University of Rochester]] and mother Anne Elizabeth Kendrick (born Hopkins) who died in 1851 after the birth of Helen's third sister. After the death of her mother, Helen aged 7 spent much of her childhood living with her aunt in [[Clinton, Clinton County, New York|Clinton, New York]] until 1860 when she spent time in [[Savannah, Georgia]] with her father's brothers leaving in 1861 due to the outbreak of the [[American civil war]]. In 1863 she enrolled as a student in the [[Oread Institute]], in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] and studied there until June, 1864. After the end of the civil war she briefly returned to Savannah and spent the rest of her childhood between there, an aunt's house in [[Utica, New York]] and her father's house in [[Rochester, New York]] where she remained until her marriage.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;&lt;ref name="myth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kendrick Johnson|first=Helen|title=Helen Kendrick Johnson (Mrs. Rossiter Johnson) the story of her varied activities|url=https://archive.org/stream/helenkendrickjo00johngoog/helenkendrickjo00johngoog_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage and writing career ==
After marrying the newspaper editor [[Rossiter Johnson]], in 1869 she began writing children's literature and travel articles.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

== Activism ==
Both Helen and her husband were active in the anti-suffrage movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.utica.edu/academic/ssm/history/victorian/hillreigel.pdf|title = Helen Kendrick Johnson|last = Hillriegel|first = Danielle|date = 5 July 2011|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = 27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1894–1896 she was editor of the American Woman’s Journal and founded the Meridian Club in 1886. Rossiter was author of a pamphlet entitled, ''Why Women Do Not Want the Ballot.'' In 1897 Helen wrote what is often considered the best summary of the arguments against woman suffrage: ''Woman and the Republic,'' in which she argued that women didn't need the vote  to establish more legal, economic and other equality and that women's role in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] was essential for maintenance of the American republic. She was openly critical of the writings of [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and her work [[The Woman's Bible]] linking it to radicalism and [[socialism]].&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; During her time as an anti-suffragette activist she addressed several [[legislative committee]] in Albany and Washington and wrote many newspaper articles and pamphlets on the subject. In 1910 she founded the Guidon Club, an anti-suffragette organization dedicated to the study of politics and government.&lt;ref name="myth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="womenrep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/library/etext/bl_watr_ps1.htm#353|title=Woman and the Republic|last=Kendrick Johnson|first=Helen|year=1913|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Alfred Rosenberg]], head of the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories]], originally feared that targeting children aged 10 to 14 would be seen as simple abduction, and proposed instead kidnapping older children aged 15 to 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1946 |title=Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression |volume=III |location=Washington |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |at=p. 71 (doc. 031-PS) }} [https://archive.org/stream/naziconspiracyag03unit#page/n78/mode/1up Online edition], [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the actions of the [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 9th Army]] induced him to consent to the kidnapping of younger children.{{r|cruel}}

The children were transferred to special camps for children called ''Kindererziehungslager,'' where the Germans selected children whose racial traits made them suitable for [[Germanization]]. Children considered racially unsuitable were sent either to [[forced labour]] or to [[concentration camp]]s, including [[Auschwitz]], after the destruction of their birth certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wasser |first=Bruno |year=1993 |title=Himmlers Raumplanung im Osten: Der Generalplan Ost in Polen 1940-1944 |series=Stadt, Planung, Geschichte |location=Basel/Berlin |publisher=Birkhäuser |isbn=978-376432852-8 |p=221 |language=de }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The children were kidnapped by the [[Army Group Centre]] and the [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|2nd Army]], whose Chief of Staff, [[Henning von Tresckow]], signed the order to abduct the children on 28 June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;''Men of 20 July and the War in the Soviet Union'' [[Christian Gerlach]] in ''War Of Extermination: The German Military In World War II'' page 139&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation reached its peak in 1944, but due to the outcome of the war the kidnappings were not fully carried out.&lt;ref name=Timm&gt;"''Herrenmensch" und "Bandit" Deutsche Kriegsführung und Besatzungspolitik als Kontext des sowjetischen Partisanenkrieges(1941-44)''Timm C.

'''Ikpide''' is an [[Isoko people|Isoko]] town in [[Nigeria]], located on the eastern bank of the lower [[River Niger]] between the source of the River Nun and Ubioakpere. The traditional north/south boundaries of Ikpide are the Ofavre-Uto Canal and Ubioakpere

==Language==
The language spoken by the people is the [[Isoko language]]. It is similar to that spoken by the neighboring [[Urhobo language|Urhobo]].

==Founding==

Considering that at least three generations of families had lived in Ikpide before the first Christian converts in 1915, it is generally believed that the town was founded by the beginning of the 19th century.

The town is named after the founder - Ikpide who migrated from the Isoko town of Irri hence the suffix 'Irri". This indicates the ancestral home of the people of Ikpide.

==Quarters==

Ikpide has four main quarters; Ogbuku (which is occupied by the descendants of Ikpide till date), Uzi, Aboh and Otehe

==Administration==

Before the introduction of British rule in Nigeria, the day-to-day administration of Ikpide was carried out through the age grade system whereby the older grades exercised authority over the younger grades. Even today vestiges of this system remain in the town. The groups are

The children age grade: Children below 16 years. Assigned to perform minor tasks.&lt;br /&gt;
The young men age grade (EVRAWHA): Young men between the ages of 16 and 35 (40). Provides the bulk of labour.&lt;br /&gt;
The Iletu age grade: Older men supervising the activities of the Evrawha.&lt;br /&gt;
The Odio age grade: Group of elders.&lt;br /&gt;
The Odio-ologbo: The apex of the system. The equivalent of Ovie (king). He is always the oldest male member of the Ikpide family. Succession is automatic.

The '''Iraqi Turkmen''' (also spelled '''Turkoman''', '''Turcoman''', '''Turkomen''', and '''Turkman'''; {{lang-tr|Irak Türkmenleri}}), also referred to as '''Iraqi Turks''', or '''Turks of Iraq''' ({{lang-ar|تركمان العراق}}, {{lang-tr|Irak Türkleri}}), are [[Iraq]]i citizens of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] origin who mostly adhere to a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] heritage and identity.&lt;ref name="Triana"&gt;{{citation |last=Triana|first=María|year=2017|title=Managing Diversity in Organizations: A Global Perspective|place=|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=1-317-42368-2|page=168|quote=Turkmen, Iraqi citizens of Turkish origin, are the third largest ethnic group in Iraq after Arabs and Kurds, and they are said to number about 3 million of Iraq's 34.7 million citizens according to the Iraqi Ministry of Planning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bassem2016 /&gt; Most Iraqi Turkmen are the descendants of the Ottoman soldiers, traders and civil servants who were brought into Iraq from [[Anatolia]] during the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Taylor 2004 loc=31" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jawhar 2010 loc=314" /&gt;&lt;ref name="International Crisis Group" /&gt; Despite the popular reference to the Turks of Iraq as "Turkmen", they are not directly related to the [[Turkmens|Turkmen people]] of [[Turkmenistan]] and do not identify as such.

==Disambiguation==
The terms "Turkmen", "Turkman", and "Turkoman" have been used in the [[Middle East]] for centuries (particularly in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], and [[Turkey]]) to define the common genealogical and linguistic ties of the Oghuz Turks in these regions. Consequently, the Iraqi Turkmen (as well as the [[Syrian Turkmen]] and Anatolian Turkmen) '''do not''' identifity themselves with the [[Turkmen people]] of [[Turkmenistan]].&lt;ref name=Peyrouse2015&gt;{{citation |last=Peyrouse|first=Sebastien|year=2015|title=Turkmenistan: Strategies of Power, Dilemmas of Development |page=62|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=0-230-11552-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sebastien Peyrouse, who is a senior research fellow with the [[Central Asia-Caucasus Institute]], has summarised the terms thusly:

{{pull quote|Many Turkic peoples who have lived for centuries in the Middle East have been called Turkmen, Turkman, and Turkoman without being seen a part of the Turkmen nation in the Turkmenistani meaning of the term... The majority of "Turkmen" in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey have been established there for several centuries and have no relationship with contemporary Turkmenistan. "Turkmen" is often used to designate Turkic-speakers in Arab areas, or Sunnis in Shitte areas. In this case, "Oghuz" more accurately identifies the common genealogical and linguistic ties.&lt;ref name=Peyrouse2015 /&gt;}}

==History==
[[File:EmperorSuleiman.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Suleiman the Magnificent]] defeated the [[Safavids]] on December 31, 1534, gaining [[Baghdad]] and, later, southern Iraq. Throughout the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman reign]], the Ottomans encouraged Turkish migration along northern Iraq.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2004 loc=31" /&gt;]]

The Iraqi Turkmens are the descendants of various waves of Turkic migration to [[Mesopotamia]] beginning from the 7th century until the end of Ottoman rule (1919). The first wave of migration dates back to the 7th century, followed by migrations during the [[Seljuk Empire]] (1037–1194), the fleeing Oghuz during the Mongol destruction of the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] (see [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ag Qoyunlu]]), and the largest migration, during the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1535–1919). With the conquest of Iraq by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in 1534, followed by Sultan [[Murad IV]]'s capture of [[Baghdad]] in 1638, a large influx of Turks—predominately from [[Anatolia]]—settled down in Iraq. Thus, most of today's Iraqi Turkmen are the descendants of the Ottoman soldiers, traders and civil servants who were brought into Iraq during the rule of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2004 loc=31"&gt;{{citation |last=Taylor|first=Scott|year=2004|title=Among the Others: Encounters with the Forgotten Turkmen of Iraq|place=|publisher=[[Esprit de Corps (magazine)|Esprit de Corps]]|isbn=1-895896-26-6|page=31|quote=The largest number of Turkmen immigrants followed the army of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent when he conquered all of Iraq in 1535.

===Migration under Arab rule===
The presence of Turkic peoples in what is today Iraq first began in the 7th century when approximately 2,000&lt;ref name="Taylor 2004 loc=30" /&gt;–5,000&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Anderson|first1=Liam D.|last2=Stansfield|first2=Gareth R.

===Seljuk migration===
The second wave of Turkmen to descend on Iraq were the Turks of the [[Great Seljuq Empire]].&lt;ref name="Taylor 2004 loc=31" /&gt; Large scale migration of the Turkmen in Iraq occurred in 1055 with the invasion of Sultan [[Toğrül|Tuğrul Bey]], the second ruler of the [[Seljuk dynasty]], who intended to repair the holy road to [[Mecca]]. For the next 150 years, the Seljuk Turks placed large Turkmen communities along the most valuable routes of northern Iraq, especially [[Tel Afar]], [[Erbil]], [[Kirkuk]], and [[Mandali, Iraq|Mandali]], which is now identified by the modern community as [[Turkmeneli]].&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these settlers assumed positions of military and administrative responsibilities in the [[Seljuk Empire]].

===Ottoman migration===

The third, and largest, wave of Turkmen migration to Iraq arose during the four centuries of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule (1535–1919).&lt;ref name="Taylor 2004 loc=31" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stansfield|2007|loc=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the first half of the sixteenth century the Ottomans had begun their expansion into Iraq, waging wars against their arch rival, the Persian [[Safavids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Fattah|first1=Hala|last2=Caso|first2=Frank|year=2009|chapter=Turkish Tribal Migrations and the Early Ottoman State|title=A Brief History of Iraq|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1534, under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, [[Mosul]] was sufficiently secure within the Ottoman Empire and became the chief province ([[eyalet]]) responsible for all other administrative districts in the region.&lt;ref name="Fattah &amp; Caso 2009 loc=116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fattah|Caso|2009|loc=116}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans encouraged migration from Anatolia and the settlement of immigrant Turkmen along northern Iraq, religious scholars were also brought in to preach [[Hanafi]] (Sunni) Islam.&lt;ref name="Fattah &amp; Caso 2009 loc=116" /&gt; With loyal Turkmen inhabiting the area, the Ottomans were able to maintain a safe route through to the southern provinces of [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name="Taylor 2004 loc=31" /&gt; Following the conquest, Kirkuk came firmly under Turkish control and was referred to as "Gökyurt",&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is this period in history whereby modern Iraqi Turkmen claim association with Anatolia and the [[Turkey|Turkish state]].&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=17" /&gt;

With the conquest of Iraq by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in 1534, followed by Sultan [[Murad IV]]'s capture of [[Baghdad]] in 1638, a large influx of Turks settled down in the region.&lt;ref name="Stansfield 2007 loc=70" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jawhar 2010 loc=314" /&gt; After defeating the Safavids on December 31, 1534, Suleiman entered Baghdad and set about reconstructing the physical infrastructure in the province and ordered the construction of a dam in [[Karbala]] and major water projects in and around the city's countryside.&lt;ref name="Fattah &amp; Caso 2009 loc=117"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fattah|Caso|2009|loc=117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the new governor was appointed, the town was to be composed of 1,000 foot soldiers and another 1,000 cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fattah|Caso|2009|loc=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, war broke out after 89 years of peace and the city was besieged and finally conquered by [[Abbas the Great]] in 1624. The Persians ruled the city until 1638 when a massive Ottoman force, led by Sultan [[Murad IV]], recaptured the city.&lt;ref name="Fattah &amp; Caso 2009 loc=116" /&gt; In 1639, the [[Treaty of Zuhab]] was signed that gave the Ottomans control over Iraq and ended the military conflict between the two empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fattah|Caso|2009|loc=120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, more Turks arrived with the army of Sultan Murad IV in 1638 following the capture of Baghdad whilst others came even later with other notable Ottoman figures.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Talabany|first=Nouri|year=2007|title=Who Owns Kirkuk?

===Post-Ottoman era===
[[File:Misak-i milli.png|thumb|right|200px|The [[Misak-ı Millî]] ("national oath") sought to include the [[Mosul Vilayet]] in the proposals for the new borders of a Turkish nation in 1920.]]

Following the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, the Iraqi Turkmen wanted Turkey to annex the [[Mosul Vilayet]] and for them to become part of an expanded state;&lt;ref name="Stansfield 2007 loc=72"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stansfield|2007|loc=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; this is because, under the Ottoman monarchy, the Iraqi Turkmen enjoyed a relatively trouble-free existence as the administrative and business classes.&lt;ref name="Stansfield 2007 loc=72" /&gt; However, due to the demise of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman monarchy]], the Iraqi Turkmen participated in elections for the [[Constituent Assembly]]; the purpose of these elections was to formalise the 1922 treaty with Britain and obtain support for the drafting of a constitution and the passing of the 1923 Electoral law.&lt;ref name="Lukitz 1995 loc=41"&gt;{{citation |last=Lukitz|first=Liora|year=1995|title=Iraq: The Search for National Identity|publisher=Routledge|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iraqi Turkmen made their participation in the electoral process conditional that the preservation of the Turkish character in Kirkuk's administration and the recognition of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as the liwa's official language.&lt;ref name="Lukitz 1995 loc=41" /&gt; Although they were recognized as a constitutive entity of Iraq, alongside the [[Arabs]] and [[Kurds]], in the constitution of 1925, the Iraqi Turkmen were later denied this status.&lt;ref name="Stansfield 2007 loc=72" /&gt;

Since the demise of the Ottoman Empire, the Iraqi Turkmens have found themselves increasingly discriminated against from the policies of successive regimes, such as the Kirkuk Massacre of 1923, 1947, 1959 and in 1979 when the [[Ba'th Party]] discriminated against the community.&lt;ref name="Stansfield 2007 loc=72" /&gt; Although they were recognized as a constitutive entity of Iraq (alongside the Arabs and Kurds) in the constitution of 1925, the Iraqi Turkmen were later denied this status.&lt;ref name="Stansfield 2007 loc=72" /&gt;

==Culture==
The Iraqi Turkmen are mostly [[Muslims]] and have close cultural and linguistic ties with the [[Anatolia]]n region of [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

===Language===
The Iraqi Turkmen speak their own [[Turkish dialects|dialect of Turkish]]&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{cite web|author=Central Intelligence Agency|title=The World Factbook: Iraq |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html|accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have particularly close linguistic ties with the  [[Anatolia]]n region of [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; Under Article 4 of the Iraqi Constitution, the Iraqi Turkmen dialect is an official language in "the administrative units in which they constitute density of population". Article 4 (1) terms the language as "Turkmen" whilst Article 4 (4) terms it as "Turkoman".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=The Republic of Iraq Ministry of Interior|title=Iraqi Constitution|url=http://www.iraqinationality.gov.iq/attach/iraqi_constitution.pdf|pages=2–3|accessdate=18 October 2016|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128152712/http://www.iraqinationality.gov.iq/attach/iraqi_constitution.pdf|archivedate=28 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the Iraqi Turkmen use the modern [[Turkish alphabet]] as the formal written language, in accordance with the 1997 Declaration of Principles adopted by the Iraqi Turkoman Congress, Article Three of which states the following:

{{pull quote|The official written language of the Turkomans is Istanbul Turkish, and its alphabet is the new Latin alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Türkmeneli İşbirliği ve Kültür Vakfı|title=Declaration of Principles of the (Iraqi?)

Due to the existence of different Turkish migration waves to Iraq for over 1,200 years, the Iraqi Turkmen dialect is by no means homogeneous.&lt;ref name="Bulut 2000 loc=161"&gt;{{citation |last=Bulut|first=Christiane|year=2000|chapter=Optative constructions in Iraqi Turkmen|title=Studies on Turkish and Turkic Languages|editor1-last=Göksel|editor1-first=Aslı|editor2-last=Kerslake|editor2-first=Celia (eds.)|place=|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=3-447-04293-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it has been influenced by several prestige languages in the region, [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] from 1534 onwards, and then [[Persian language|Persian]] after the [[Capture of Baghdad (1624)]]. Once the Ottomans took back Iraq in 1640, the Turkish varieties of Iraq continued to be influenced by [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], as well as other languages in the region, such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]].&lt;ref name="Bulut 2000 loc=161" /&gt;

According to some linguists, the dialect spoken by Iraqi Turkmen is similar to the [[South Azeri]] dialect used by the Turkish [[Yörüks|Yörük tribes]] in the [[Balkans]] and [[Anatolia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Boeschoten|first=Hendrik|year=1998|chapter=Speakers of Turkic Languages|title=The Turkic Languages|editor1-last=Johanson|editor1-first=Lars |editor2-last=Csató|editor2-first=Éva Ágnes|publisher=Routledge|page=5|isbn=|quote=There is a Turkish – or rather Azerbaijanian-speaking part of the population of northern Iraq which is sometimes called "Turkmen", similar to the Yuruk tribes in the Balkans and in Anatolia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bayatlı|first=Hidayet Kemal|year=1996|title=İrak Türkmen Türkçesi |place=|publisher=Atatürk Kültür, Dil ve Tarih Yüksek Kurumu|page=329|isbn=9789751608338|quote=Türkmenlerinin  konuştukları ağız, Türkçenin Azeri ağzı (Doğu Oğuzca) sahası içine girmektedir.

Thus, the Iraqi Turkmen grammar differs sharply from Irano-Turkic varieties, such as South Azeri and [[Afshar language|Afshar]] types.&lt;ref name="Johanson 2001 loc=15-16" /&gt;

Under the 1925 Iraqi Constitution, the use of Istanbul Turkish in schools, government offices and the media was allowed. Modern Turkish influence remained strong until the Arabic language became the new official language in the 1930s, and a degree of Turkmen–Turkish [[diglossia]] is still observable.&lt;ref name="Johanson 2001 loc=15-16" /&gt; Restrictions on the Turkish language began in 1972 and intensified under [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Al-Shawi|first=Ibrahim|year=2006|title=A Glimpse of Iraq|publisher=Lulu|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraqi Turkmen Announce Formation of New Jihadi Group|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=4795|first=Bakier|last=Abdul Hameed|work=The Jamestown Foundation|date=March 18, 2008|accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish speakers in Iraq are often [[bilingual]] or [[trilingual]]; [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is acquired through the mass media and through education at school whilst [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is acquired in their neighbourhoods and through marriage.&lt;ref name="Bulut 2000 loc=161" /&gt;

====Education in Turkish====
[[File:Karakoyunlu Boys Secondary School.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bilingual sign (Arabic and Turkish) of an Iraqi Turkmen boys secondary school.]]
[[File:Zeynep Ana Girls Secondary School.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bilingual sign (Arabic and Turkish) of an Iraqi Turkmen girls secondary school.]]
In 2005 Iraqi Turkmen community leaders decided that the [[Turkish language]] would replace the use of traditional Turkmeni in Iraqi schools;&lt;ref name="Shanks 2016 loc=57"&gt;{{citation|last=Shanks|first=Kelsey|year=2016|title=Education and Ethno-Politics: Defending Identity in Iraq|page=57|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=1-317-52043-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkmeni had used the [[Arabic script]] whereas Turkish uses the [[Latin script]] (see [[Turkish alphabet]]).&lt;ref name="Shanks 2016 loc=57" /&gt; Kelsey Shanks has argued that "the move to Turkish can be seen as a means to strengthen the collective "we" identity by continuing to distinguish it from the other ethnic groups... The use of Turkish was presented as a natural progression from the Turkmen; any suggestion that the oral languages were different was immediately rejected."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shanks|2016|loc=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parental literacy rates in Turkish are low, as most are more familiar with the Arabic script (due to the [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'athist]] regime). Therefore, the Turkmen Directorate of Education in [[Kirkuk]] has started Turkish language lessons for the wider society. Furthermore, the Ministry of Education Turkmen officer in [[Ninewa]] has requested to the "United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq" for the instigation of Turkish language classes for parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shanks|2016|loc=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Media in Turkish====
The current prevalence of [[satellite television]] and media exposure from [[Turkey]] may have led to the standardisation of Turkmeni towards Turkish, and the preferable language for adolescents associating with the [[Turkish culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shanks|2016|loc=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the [[Türkmeneli TV]] channel was launched in [[Kirkuk]], [[Iraq]]. It broadcasts programmes in the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] languages.&lt;ref name="orsam"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|year=2012|title=Türkmeneli Tv-Radyo Genel Yayın Yönetmeni Yalman Hacaroğlu ile Söyleşi|url=http://orsam.org.tr/orsam/soylesi/10076?dil=ar|publisher=ORSAM|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, Türkmeneli TV has studios in [[Kirkuk]] and [[Baghdad]] in [[Iraq]], and in the [[Çankaya, Ankara (neighbourhood)|Çankaya]] neighbourhood in [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="orsam" /&gt; Türkmeneli TV has signed agreements with several Turkish channels, such as [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]], [[TGRT]] and [[ATV (Turkey)|ATV]], as well as with the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]]'s main broadcaster [[Bayrak|BRT]], to share programmes and documentaries.&lt;ref name="orsam" /&gt;

===Religion===
The Iraqi Turkmen  are predominately [[Muslims]]. The [[Sunni]] Turkmen form the majority (about 60%-70%) but there is also a significant number of Turkmen practicing the [[Shia]] branch of Islam (about 30% to 40%).&lt;ref name=Oğuzlu313&gt;{{citation|last=Oğuzlu|first=Tarik H.|year=2004|title=Endangered community:The Turkoman identity in Iraq|journal=Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs|volume=24|issue=2|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Jawhar|first=Raber Tal'at|year=2010|chapter=The Iraqi Turkmen Front|url=http://ifpo.revues.org/1115|title=Returning to Political Parties?|editor1-last=Catusse|editor1-first=Myriam|editor2-last=Karam|editor2-first=Karam (eds.)|place=|publisher=The Lebanese Center for Policy Studies|pages=313–328|isbn=1-886604-75-4|quote=In short, Iraqi Turkmen are a unique ethnic group; they are predominantly Muslim and divided into two main sects: Shiites (40%) Sunnites (60%), and have strong cultural ties with Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Turkmen are mainly [[secular]], having internalized the secularist interpretation of state–religion affairs practiced in the [[Republic of Turkey]] since its foundation in 1923.&lt;ref name=Oğuzlu313/&gt; Moreover, the fact that the Turkmen mainly live in urban areas, where they deal with trade and commerce, and their tendency to acquire [[higher education]], the power of religious and tribal factors inherent in Iraq’s political culture does not significantly affect the Turkmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oğuzlu|2004|loc=314}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Past censuses and controversies=====
[[File:Iraqi Turkmen man in Kirkuk.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An Iraqi Turkmen in [[Kirkuk]].]]
The 1957 Iraqi census (which is recognized as the last reliable census, as later censuses were reflections of the Arabization policies of the [[Ba'ath]] regime&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;) recorded 567,000 Turks out of a total population of 6.3 million, forming 9% of the total Iraqi population.&lt;ref name="Knights 2004 loc=262" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Güçlü 2007 loc=79" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Betts 2013 loc=86" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; This put them third, behind [[Arabs]] and [[Kurds]].&lt;ref name="Gunter 2004 loc=131"&gt;{{citation|last=Gunter|first=Michael M.|year=2004|url=http://www.navend.de/aktuell/pdf/2004-03-30/Kurds_In_Iraq_Middle_East_Policy_2004_No_1.pdf|title=The Kurds in Iraq|journal=Middle East Policy|volume=11|issue=1|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the undemocratic environment, their number has always been underestimated and has long been a point of controversy. For example, in the 1957 census, the Iraqi government first claimed that there was 136,800 Turks in Iraq. However, the revised figure of 567,000 was issued after the 1958 revolution when the Iraqi government admitted that the Iraqi Turkmen population was actually more than 400% from the previous year's total.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2004 loc=79"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2004|loc=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott Taylor (journalist)|Scott Taylor]] has described the political nature of the results thusly:

{{pull quote|According to the 1957 census conducted by King [[Faisal II]] — a monarch supported by the [[Great Britain|British]] — there were only 136,800 Turkmen in all of Iraq. Bearing in mind that since the British had wrested control of [[Mesopotamia]] from the Turks after the [[First World War]], a deliberate campaign had been undertaken to eradicate or diminish all remnants of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] influence. Therefore it should not be surprising that after [[Abdul Karim Kassem]] launched his successful [[14 July Revolution|revolution]] in 1958 – killing 23-year-old King Faisal II, expelling the British and declaring Iraq a republic – that a different set of numbers was published. According to the second census of 1958, the Turkmen registry stood at 567,000 – an increase of more than 400 per cent from the previous year's total.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2004 loc=28" /&gt;}}

Subsequent censuses, in 1967, 1977, 1987 and 1997, are all considered highly unreliable, due to suspicions of regime manipulation.&lt;ref name="International Crisis Group 2008 loc=16"&gt;{{Harvnb|International Crisis Group|2008|loc=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 census states that there was 600,000&lt;ref name="International Crisis Group" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Phillips|first=David L.|year=2006|title=Losing Iraq: Inside the Postwar Reconstruction Fiasco|place=|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-05681-4|page=304|quote=Behind the Arabs and the Kurds, Turkmen are the third-largest ethnic group in Iraq.

====Other estimates====
In 2004 [[Scott Taylor (journalist)|Scott Taylor]] suggested that the Iraqi Turkmen population accounted for 2,080,000 of Iraq's 25 million inhabitants (forming 8.32% of the population)&lt;ref name="Taylor 2004 loc=28" /&gt; whilst [[Patrick Clawson]] has stated that the Iraqi Turkmen make up about 9% of the total population.&lt;ref name="UNPO" /&gt; Furthermore, international organizations such as the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] has stated that the Iraqi Turkmen community is 3 million or 9–13% of the Iraqi population.&lt;ref name=UNPO1&gt;{{cite web|author=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization|title=Iraqi Turkmen|url=http://www.unpo.org/members/7878|accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNPO2&gt;{{cite web|author=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization|title=The Turkmen of Iraq: Underestimated, Marginalized and exposed to assimilation Terminology |url=http://www.unpo.org/article/2610|accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iraqi Turkmen claim that their total population is over 3 million.&lt;ref name="Park 2005 loc=32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kibaroğlu 2009 loc=165"&gt;{{citation|last1=Kibaroğlu|first1=Mustafa|last2=Kibaroğlu|first2=Ayșegül|last3=Halman|first3=Talât Sait|year=2009|title=Global security watch Turkey: A reference handbook|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unpo.org/article/19562] Iraqi Turkmen: Push for Self-Determination Gains Momentum&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some Kurdish groups claim that the Iraqi Turkmen make up 2–3% of the Iraqi population, or approximately 500,000–800,000.&lt;ref name="Jenkins 2008 loc=6"&gt;{{citation |last=Jenkins|first=Gareth|year=2008|title=Turkey and Northern Iraq: An Overview|url=http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Jamestown-JenkinsTurkeyNIraq.pdf|publisher=The Jamestown Foundation|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iraqi Turkmen primarily inhabit northern Iraq, particularly in a region they refer to as "[[Turkmeneli]]" – which stretches from the northwest to the east at the middle of Iraq. Iraqi Turkmen consider their capital city to be [[Kirkuk]].&lt;ref name="MEO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Park 2005 loc=32" /&gt; Liam Anderson and Gareth Stansfield describe the Turkmeneli region as follows:

Turkmen sources note that Turcomania – an anglicized version of "Turkmeneli" – appears on a map of the region published by [[William Guthrie]] in 1785, but there is no clear reference to Turkmeneli until the end of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Iraqi Turkmen generally consider several major cities, and small districts associated with these cities, as part of Turkmeneli.&lt;ref name=Oğuzlu313/&gt; The major cities claimed to be a part of their homeland include: [[Altun Kupri]], [[Badra, Iraq|Badra]], [[Bakuba]], [[Diala]], [[Erbil]],  [[Khanaqin]], [[Kifri]], [[Kirkuk]], [[Kizilribat]], [[Mendeli]], [[Mosul]], [[Salahaldeen]], [[Sancar]], [[Tal Afar]], and [[Tuz Khurmatu]].&lt;ref name=Oğuzlu313/&gt; Thus, the Turkmeneli region lies between the Arab areas of settlement to the south and Kurdish areas to the north.&lt;ref name=Oğuzlu313/&gt;

According to the 1957 census the Iraqi Turkmen formed the majority of inhabitants in the city of [[Kirkuk]], with 40% declaring their mother toungue as "[[Turkish language|Turkish]]".&lt;ref name="Park 2005 loc=32"&gt;{{citation|last=Park|first=Bill|year=2005|title=Turkey's policy towards northern Iraq: problems and perspectives|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=O'Leary|first=Brendan|year=2009|title=How to get out of Iraq with integrity|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second-largest Iraqi Turkmen city is Tel Afar where they make up 95% of the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hashim|first=Ahmed|year=2005|title=Insurgency and counter-insurgency in Iraq|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; The once mainly Turkoman cities  of the [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala Province]] and [[Kifri]] have been heavily [[Kurdification|Kurdified]] and [[Arabization|Arabified]].&lt;ref name=UNPO2 /&gt;

===Diaspora===
{{seealso|Turkish diaspora}}
Most Iraqi Turkmen migrate to [[Turkey]] followed by [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="Sirkeci 2005 loc=20"&gt;{{citation |last=Sirkeci|first=Ibrahim|year=2005|title=Turkmen in Iraq and International Migration of Turkmen|publisher=University of Bristol|page=2-|url=http://www.migrationletters.com/turkmen/turkmeneng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller communities have been formed in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]],&lt;ref name="Sirkeci 2005 loc=20" /&gt; [[Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wanche|first=Sophia I.|year=2004|title=An Assessment of the Iraqi Communityin Greece|url=http://www.aina.org/reports/aoticig.pdf|publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|isbn=|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=International Organization for Migration |first= |year=2007 |title=Iraq Mapping Exercise |url=http://www.iomlondon.org/doc/mapping/IOM_IRAQ.pdf |publisher=International Organization for Migration |isbn= |page=5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716163637/http://www.iomlondon.org/doc/mapping/IOM_IRAQ.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social issues==
The position of the Iraqi Turkmen has changed from being administrative and business classes of the [[Ottoman Empire]] to an increasingly discriminated against minority.&lt;ref name="Stansfield 2007 loc=72" /&gt; Since the demise of the Ottoman Empire, the Iraqi Turkmen have been victims of several massacres, such as the Kirkuk Massacre of 1959.  Furthermore, under the Ba'th party, discrimination against the Iraqi Turkmen increased, with several leaders being executed in 1979&lt;ref name="Stansfield 2007 loc=72" /&gt; as well as the Iraqi Turkmen community being victims of [[Arabization]] policies by the state, and [[Kurdification]] by Kurds seeking to push them forcibly out of their homeland.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they have suffered from various degrees of suppression and assimilation that ranged from political persecution and exile to terror and [[ethnic cleansing]]. Despite being recognized in the 1925 constitution as a constitutive entity, the Iraqi Turkmen were later denied this status; hence, cultural rights were gradually taken away and activists were sent to exile.&lt;ref name="Stansfield 2007 loc=72" /&gt;

===Massacres===
====Massacre of 4 May 1924====
In 1924, the Iraqi Turkmen were seen as a disloyal remnant of the [[Ottoman Empire]], with a neutral tie to [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s new Turkish nationalist ideology emerging in the [[Republic of Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=63"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Iraqi Turkmen living in the region of [[Kirkuk]] posed a threat to the stability of Iraq, particularly as they did not support the ascendancy of [[King Faisal I]] to the throne.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=63" /&gt; The Iraqi Turkmen were targeted by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in collaboration with other Iraqi elements, of these, the most willing to subjugate the Iraqi Turkmen were the [[Iraq Levies]]—troops recruited from the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian community]] that had sought refuge in Iraq from the [[Hakkari]] region of Turkey.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=63" /&gt; The spark for the conflict had been a dispute between a Levi soldier and an Iraqi Turkmen shopkeeper, which was enough for the British to allow the Levies to attack the Iraqi Turkmen, resulting in the massacre of some 200 people.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=63" /&gt;

====Kirkuk massacre of 1959====
The Kirkuk massacre of 1959 came about due to the Iraqi government allowing the [[Iraqi Communist Party]], which in Kirkuk was largely Kurdish, to target the Iraqi Turkmen.&lt;ref name="Stansfield 2007 loc=72" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the appointment of [[Maarouf Barzinji]], a Kurd, as the mayor of Kirkuk in July 1959, tensions rose following the 14 July revolution celebrations, with animosity in the city polarizing rapidly between the Kurds and Iraqi Turkmen. On 14 July 1959, fights broke out between the Iraqi Turkmen and Kurds, leaving some 20 Iraqi Turkmen dead.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, on 15 July 1959, Kurdish soldiers of the [[Fourth Brigade (Iraq)|Fourth Brigade]] of the Iraqi army mortared Iraqi Turkmen residential areas, destroying 120 houses.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=34" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ghanim|first=David|year=2011|title=Iraq's Dysfunctional Democracy|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Order was restored on 17 July by military units from [[Baghdad]]. The Iraqi government referred to the incident as a "massacre"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Entessar|first=Nader|year=2010|title=Kurdish Politics in the Middle East|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that between 31 and 79 Iraqi Turkmen were killed and some 130 injured.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=34" /&gt;

===Arabization===
[[File:Iraqi Turkmen protest in Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Turks protesting in [[Amsterdam]], the banner reads: 'Kirkuk is an Iraqi city with Turkmen characteristics'.]]

In 1980, [[Saddam Hussein]]'s government adopted a policy of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of its minorities. Due to government relocation programs, thousands of Iraqi Turkmen were relocated from their traditional homelands in northern Iraq and replaced by Arabs, in an effort to [[Arabization|Arabize]] the region.&lt;ref name="Jenkins 2008 loc=15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jenkins|2008|loc=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Iraqi Turkmen villages and towns were destroyed to make way for Arab migrants, who were promised free land and financial incentives. For example, the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'th regime]] recognised that the city of [[Kirkuk]] was historically an Iraqi Arab city and remained firmly in its cultural orientation.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the first wave of Arabization saw Arab families move from the centre and south of Iraq into Kirkuk to work in the expanding oil industry. Although the Iraqi Turkmen were not actively forced out, new Arab quarters were established in the city and the overall demographic balance of the city changed as the Arab migrations continued.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=64" /&gt;

Several presidential decrees and directives from state security and intelligence organizations indicate that the Iraqi Turkmen were a particular focus of attention during the assimilation process during the Ba'th regime. For example, the Iraqi Military Intelligence issued directive 1559 on 6 May 1980 ordering the deportation of Iraqi Turkmen officials from Kirkuk, issuing the following instructions: "identify the places where Turkmen officials are working in governmental offices [in order] to deport them to other governorates in order to disperse them and prevent them from concentrating in this governorate [Kirkuk]".&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=65"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, on 30 October 1981, the Revolution's Command Council issued decree 1391, which authorized the deportation of Iraqi Turkmen from Kiruk with paragraph 13 noting that "this directive is specially aimed at Turkmen and Kurdish officials and workers who are living in Kirkuk".&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=65" /&gt;

As primary victims of these Arabization policies, the Iraqi Turkmen suffered from land expropriation and job discrimination, and therefore would register themselves as "Arabs" in order to avoid discrimination.&lt;ref name="International Crisis Group 2006 loc=5"&gt;{{Harvnb|International Crisis Group|2006|loc=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[ethnic cleansing]] was an element of the Ba'thist policy aimed at reducing the influence of the Iraqi Turkmen in northern Iraq's Kirkuk.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=66"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Those Iraqi Turkmen who remained in cities such as Kirkuk were subject to continued assimilation policies;&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=66" /&gt; school names, neighbourhoods, villages, streets, markets and even mosques with names of Turkic origin were changed to names that emanated from the Ba'th Party or from Arab heroes.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=66" /&gt; Moreover, many Iraqi Turkmen villages and neighbourhoods in Kirkuk were simply demolished, particularly in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=66" /&gt;

===Turkmen–Kurd tension and Kurdification===
[[File:Iraqi Turkmen woman holding a placard.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Iraqi Turkmen woman holding a placard written in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: Kerkük'ü hiçbir güç Kürtleştiremez ("No power can Kurdify Kirkuk").]]

The Kurds claimed ''[[de facto]]'' [[sovereignty]] over land that Iraqi Turkmen regards as theirs. For the Iraqi Turkmen, their identity is deeply inculcated as the rightful inheritors of the region as a legacy of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is claimed that the Kurdistan Region and Iraqi government has constituted a threat to the survival of the Iraqi Turkmen through strategies aimed at eradicating or assimilating them.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=67" /&gt; The largest concentration of Iraqi Turkmen tended to be in [[Tal Afar]]. The formation of the [[Kurdistan Region]] in 1991 created high animosity between the Kurds and Iraqi Turkmen, resulting in some Iraqi Turkmen being victims of [[Kurdification]], according to the Liam Anderson. The largest concentration of Iraqi Turkmen tended to be in the de facto capital of [[Erbil]], a city which they had assumed prominent administrative and economic positions. Thus, they increasingly came into dispute and often conflict with the ruling powers of the city, which after 1996 was the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party]] of [[Massoud Barzani]].&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=68"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Anderson and Stansfield, in the 1990s, tension between the Kurds and Iraqi Turkmen inflamed as the KDP and the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] (PUK) were institutionalized as the political hegemons of the region and, from the perspective of the Iraqi Turkmen, sought to marginalize them from the positions of authority and to subsume their culture with an all-pervading Kurdistani identity. With the support of [[Ankara]], a new political front of Turkmen parties, the [[Iraqi Turkmen Front]] (ITF), was formed on 24 April 1995.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=68"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the Iraqi Turkmen Front and the KDP was tense and deteriorated as the decade went on. Iraqi Turkmen associated with the Iraqi Turkmen Front complained about harassment by Kurdish security forces.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=68" /&gt; In March 2000, the [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that the KDP's security attacked the offices of the ITF in Erbil, killing two guards, following a lengthy period of disputes between the two parties.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=68" /&gt; In 2002, the KDP created an Iraqi Turkmen political organization, the [[Turkmen National Association]], that supported the further institutionalization of the Kurdistan Region. This was viewed by pro-ITF Iraqi Turkmen as a deliberate attempt to "buy off" Iraqi Turkmen opposition and break their bonds with [[Ankara]].&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=69"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted by the KDP as the "true voice" of the Iraqi Turkmen, the Turkmen National Association has a pro-Kurdistani stance and has effectively weakened the ITF as the sole representative voice of the Iraqi Turkmen.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=69" /&gt; Beginning in 2003, there were riots between Kurds and Turkmen in Kirkuk, a city that Turkmen views as historically theirs.&lt;ref&gt;The Legacy of Iraq by Benjamin Isakhan Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to United Nations reports, the KRG and Peshmerga are "illegaily policing Kirkurk, abducting Turkmen and Arabs and subjecting them to torture". Between 2003 and 2006, Kurds have oppressed Turkmen in Tal A'far, with 1,350 deads and thousands of houses damaged or demolished and 4,685 families displaced.&lt;ref&gt;The Legacy of Iraq by Benjamin Isakhan Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Between ten and twelve Turkmen individuals were [[Iraqi legislative election, January 2005|elected]] to the transitional [[National Assembly of Iraq]] in January 2005, including five on the [[United Iraqi Alliance]] list, three from the [[Iraqi Turkmen Front]] (ITF), and either two or four from the [[Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zaman.com/?bl=columnists&amp;alt=&amp;trh=20050220&amp;hn=16703 Interesting Outcomes in Iraqi Election] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103012724/http://www.zaman.com/?bl=columnists&amp;alt=&amp;trh=20050220&amp;hn=16703 |date=2005-11-03 }}, Zaman Daily Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Setav"&gt;[http://www.setav.org/document/SE1_406_Iraq_English.pdf The New Iraq, The Middle East and Turkey: A Turkish View] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305150302/http://www.setav.org/document/SE1_406_Iraq_English.pdf |date=2009-03-05 }}, ''Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research'', 2006-04-01, accessed on 2007-09-06&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Iraqi legislative election, December 2005|December 2005 elections]], between five and seven Turkmen candidates were elected to the Council of Representatives. This included one candidate from the ITF (its leader [[Saadeddin Arkej]]), two or four from the [[United Iraqi Alliance]], one from the [[Iraqi Accord Front]] and one from the [[Kurdistani Alliance]].&lt;ref name="Setav" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kerkuk.net/haberler/haber.aspx?dil=2057&amp;metin=200601229 Turkmen Win Only One Seat in Kerkuk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619232538/http://www.kerkuk.net/haberler/haber.aspx?dil=2057&amp;metin=200601229 |date=2008-06-19 }}, Iraqi Turkmen Front&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraqi Turkmen have also emerged as a key political force in the controversy over the future status of northern Iraq and the [[Kurdish Autonomous Region]]. The government of Turkey has helped fund such political organizations as the [[Iraqi Turkmen Front]], which opposes Iraqi federalism and in particular the proposed annexation of Kirkuk to the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/563D3875-FE1D-4C26-9146-F91377A4FB19.htm Kurds Accused Of Rigging Kirkuk Vote] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821184732/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/563D3875-FE1D-4C26-9146-F91377A4FB19.htm |date=2006-08-21 }}, Al Jazeera&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions between the two groups over Kirkuk, however, have slowly died out and on January 30, 2006, the President of Iraq, [[Jalal Talabani]], said that the "Kurds are working on a plan to give Iraqi Turkmen autonomy in areas where they are a majority in the new constitution they're drafting for the Kurdistan Region of Iraq."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kurdistanweekly.dk/news.php?readmore=103| title=Talabani: Autonomy for Turkmen in Kurdistan| publisher=Kurdistan Weekly| first=Ilnur| last=Cevik| date=2006-01-30| accessdate=2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it never happened and the policies of [[Kurdification]] by [[KDP]] and [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]] after 2003 (with non-Kurds being pressed to move) have prompted serious inter-ethnic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stansfield|2007|loc=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Manila Film Center]]''': A major component of the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex|Cultural Center of the Philippines]], the facility was the site of a construction accident in 1981. When construction of the building was rushed for [[Manila Film Center#The First Manila Film Festival|a film festival]], the ceiling scaffolding collapsed, killing several workmen. Rather than halt construction to rescue survivors and retrieve the bodies of the dead workmen, First Lady [[Imelda Marcos]], the main financier of the project, was believed to have ordered cement to be poured into the orchestra, entombing the fallen workmen, some of whom were even buried alive. Various ghostly activities have been reported, including mysterious sounds, voices and [[poltergeist]] activity. In the late 1990s, a group called the Spirit Questors began to make visits to the film center, in an attempt to contact and appease the souls of the workmen who were killed in the building. Some of these spirits claimed to have moved on, but a few allegedly remain.&lt;ref name="CNNPh10HPMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PhilStarMM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gmapinoytv.igma.tv/sidetrip/blog/?/archives/42-The-Manila-Film-Center-mystery-A-ghostly-place-or-an-urban-legend.html/ |title=The Manila Film Center mystery: A ghostly place or an urban legend? |date=1 November 2005 |work=Sidetrip with Howie Severino |accessdate=14 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603051032/http://gmapinoytv.igma.tv/sidetrip/blog/?%2Farchives%2F42-The-Manila-Film-Center-mystery-A-ghostly-place-or-an-urban-legend.html%2F |archivedate=3 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PhilStarHauntedP"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.philstar.com/cebu-lifestyle/2015/11/01/1517174/haunted-places |title= Haunted places {{!}} Cebu Lifestyle, The Freeman Sections, The Freeman |author= Galan, Daniel Drake |website=PhilStar.com |publisher=[[Philippine Star]] |date=1 November 2015 |accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility, formerly abandoned due to its reputation, is now in use after restoration works.

'''Nasu''' (Naisu, Eastern Yi), or Nasu proper, is a [[Loloish language]] spoken by a quarter million [[Yi people]] of [[China]]. Nasu proper and Wusa Nasu are two of six [[Yi languages]] recognized by the government of China. Unlike most written Yi languages, Nasu proper uses the [[Pollard script|Pollard]] (Miao) script. A distinct form of the [[Yi script]] was traditionally used for Wusa, though few can still read it.

According to the ''Guizhou Ethnic Gazetteer'' (2002),&lt;ref name="Gazetteer"&gt;Guizhou Province Gazetteer: Ethnic Gazetteer [贵州省志. 民族志] (2002). Guiyang: Guizhou Ethnic Publishing House [貴州民族出版社].&lt;/ref&gt; Yi autonyms include Nasu 哪苏,&lt;ref&gt;http://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/themes/asia/docs/people-groups/China/chinaPeoples/N/NasuWusa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Tusu 兔苏,&lt;ref&gt;http://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/themes/asia/docs/people-groups/China/chinaPeoples/T/Tushu.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Lagou 腊勾,&lt;ref&gt;http://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/themes/asia/docs/people-groups/China/chinaPeoples/L/Lagou.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Guo 果,&lt;ref&gt;http://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/themes/asia/docs/people-groups/China/chinaPeoples/G/Guopu.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and so forth.

Most of Yi people of the Luquan area do not have the autonym Luoluo and Nasu (transliterasted into Chinese as 纳苏) means "black", hence the Black Yi (黑彝 Hei Yi),&lt;ref&gt;彝族文化研究文集 1988 - Page 100 "西一带的彝族,仍有自称为"罗罗"。同时,男人自称"罗颇" ,女人自称"罗摩"。前述流行《四方八虎"图的滇东北武定、禄劝一带大多数彝族,虽己没有"罗罗》之自称,而从彝族尚黑祟虎的传统中,咯虎取黑以自称"纳苏"为《黑人"或《黑族" (彝语《纳"义为黑、大、深、 ...&lt;/ref&gt; though Black Yi is an aristocratic caste distinction among the Yi People, and Black Yi Script (Heiyiwen) was a Latin script for Yi introduced by missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;黃新宪 ''基督敎敎育与中国社会变迁'' 福建教育出版社, 1996.

==Classification==
===Chen (1985)===
Chen, et al. (1985:108) recognizes 3 major varieties of ''Eastern Yi'' (i.e., Nasu) that are spoken in [[Yunnan]] and [[Guizhou]] provinces, namely ''Dianqian'' 滇黔 (Yunnan-Guizhou), ''Pan'' 盘县 ([[Pan County]] of [[Guizhou]]), and ''Diandongbei'' 滇东北 (Northeastern Yunnan).&lt;ref&gt;Chen Shilin [陈士林], et al. 1985. ''Yiyu jianzhi'' [彝语简志]. Beijing: Ethnic Publishing House [民族出版社].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exonym and endonym|Autonyms]] include ''no55 su55'' (alternatively ''nɤ55 su13''), ''na33 su33 pho55'' (including ''na33 so33 pho55'', ''nɤ55 su33 phu55'', and ''ni55 su33 phu55''), ''nɒ55 pho55'', and ''ko33 pho55''.

*'''Dianqian 滇黔次方言''': 4 dialects
**'''Shuixi 水西土语''': spoken in Bijie, Qianxi, Dafang, Zhijin, Nayong, Qingzhen, and Zhenxiong counties

===Huang (1993)===
In his description of the [[Yi script]] (not the spoken language) Huáng Jiànmíng (1993) holds that the Nasu variety of Yi script is used by the groups speaking languages of the Nasu language cluster of [[Northern Yi]] in south-eastern Sìchuān, eastern Yúnnán, Gùizhōu, as well as in Guǎngxī.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Hill Medieval Tibeto-Burman Languages IV  2012- Page 450 "The Nasu variety is used by the groups speaking languages of the Nasu language cluster of Northern Yi in the south-eastern part of Sìchuān, the eastern part of Yúnnán, Gùizhōu, as well as in Guǎngxī. Huáng Jiànmíng (1993: 152)"&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguishes two sub-groups. Nasu proper used in Wuding, Luquan and the suburbs of Kunming, and Wusa used in Guizhou and the bordering areas of Eastern Yunnan.

===Bradley (1997)===
David Bradley (1997) distinguishes three main dialects of Nasu:

*'''Southeastern''' (Panxian): 150,000 speakers in southwestern Guizhou
*'''Northeastern''' (Nesu): 300,000 speakers, comprising most of the other Nasu speakers of Guizhou, and some in extreme northeastern Yunnan and southeastern Sichuan
**Shuixi subdialect 水西土语
**Wusa subdialect 乌撒土语
**Mangbu subdialect 芒部土语
**Wumeng subdialect 乌蒙土语
*'''Western''' (Nasu proper): 250,000 speakers all in north-central Yunnan; Black (more numerous) and Red subdialects

===Lama (2012)===
Lama (2012) determined that Nasu (Western) is more closely related to [[Gepo language|Gepo]] than it is to the others:

*'''Nesu'''
**Panxian (Nasepho, ''{{IPA|na˧su˧pʰo˥}}''): North and South dialects
**Shuixi Nesu (Dafang Nesu)
**Nesu proper
***Wumeng
***Mangbu
***Wusa (Wusa Nasu)
*Nasu
**'''Nasu''' proper
**'''[[Gepo language|Gepo]]''' (''{{IPA|ko˧pʰu˦}}''): 100,000 speakers

'''New7Wonders Cities''' is the third in a series of Internet-based polls operated by the New7Wonders Foundation. Founder-President, [https://about.new7wonders.com/the-project-founder-bernard-weber-a-short-history/ Bernard Weber], is a Swiss-born Canadian filmmaker, museum curator, aviator, and explorer. Based in [[San Francisco]], [[United States]], Weber’s latest campaign to find the best cities in the world aimed to showcase the "cities that best represent the achievements and aspirations of our global urban civilization".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/seven-urban-wonders-of-the-world-2014-12|title=These 7 Cities Are The New 'Urban Wonders' Of The World|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global competition began{{when|date=June 2018}} with more than 1200 nominees from 220 countries. That list was reduced to 77, since there was a limit of one city per country. Then the 77 remaining cities were narrowed down by a panel of experts headed by [[Federico Mayor Zaragoza]], former director-general of [[UNESCO]], to 28 suggestions. Following the announcement of the 28 finalists, the winning seven cities were chosen by voters from around the world.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Announced in 2011, it culminated in 2014 with the choice of the following 7 winning cities: [[Beirut]], [[Doha]], [[Durban]], [[Havana]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[La Paz]] and [[Vigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.new7wonders.com/en/cities|title=New7Wonders Cities|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109160159/https://www.new7wonders.com/en/cities|archivedate=9 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19015">The '''non-monetary economy''' represents work such as household labor, care giving and civic activity that does not have a monetary [[Value (economics)|value]] but remains a vitally important part of the [[economy]].&lt;ref name="Cahn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cahn|first=Edgar S.|title=The Non-Monetary Economy|pages=1–8|url=http://timebanks.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Non-MonetaryEconomy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; While labor that results in monetary compensation is more highly valued than unpaid labor, nearly half of American productive work goes on outside of the [[market economy]] and is not represented in production measures such as the [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]].&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;

==Function==
The non-monetary economy undertakes tasks that benefit society (whether through producing services, products, or making investments) that the monetary economy does not value.&lt;ref name="Seyfang"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seyfang|first=Gill|title=Working Outside the Box: Community Currencies, Time Banks and Social Inclusion|journal=Journal of Social Policy|date=January 2004|volume=33|issue=1|pages=49–71|doi=10.1017/S0047279403007232}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The non-monetary economy makes the [[labor market]] more inclusive by valuing previously ignored forms of work.&lt;ref name="Seyfang" /&gt;{{examples|date=September 2018}} Some acknowledge the non-monetary economy as having a moral or socially conscious philosophy that attempts to end [[social exclusion]] by including poor and unemployed individuals, providing economic opportunities and access to services and goods.&lt;ref name="Peacock"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peacock|first=Mark S.|title=The Moral Economy of Parallel Currencies: An Analysis of Local Exchange Trading Systems|journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology|date=15 November 2006|volume=65|issue=5|pages=1059–1083|doi=10.1111/j.1536-7150.2006.00491.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community-based and [[grassroots]] movements encourage the community to be more participatory, thus providing a more democratic economic structure.&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;

== Forms of the non-monetary economy ==

=== Core (or social) economy ===
The ''social economy'' refers to the space between public and private sectors occupied by civil society, including community organizations, volunteering, social enterprises, and cooperatives. The social economy represents “a wide family of initiatives and organisational forms — i.e. a hybridisation of market, non-market (redistribution) and non- monetary (reciprocity) economies”.&lt;ref name="Seyfang 2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seyfang|first1=Gill|title=Time Banks and the Social Economy: Exploring the UK Policy Context|url=http://www.cserge.ac.uk/sites/default/files/edm_2006_01.pdf|website=www.cserge.ac.uk|publisher=CSERGE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than being fringe activities at the margins of the formal economy, this amounts to a significant level of activity: The "civil society" sector of the United Kingdom employs the equivalent of 1.4 million full-time employees (5% of the economically active population) and benefits from the unpaid efforts of the equivalent of 1.7 million full-time volunteers (5.6% of the economically active population), and contributes 6.8% of [[GDP]].&lt;ref name="Seyfang 2" /&gt;

[[Edgar S. Cahn]] developed the concept of the ''core economy'' to describe the informal social networks that he considered the bedrock of society, which he felt were eroding as monetary economies de-legitimized them. The core economy as he defined it consists of social capital,{{when defined as|date=September 2018}} and generates collective efficacy that's of critical importance to the core economy.

''Collective efficacy'' refers to the effectiveness of informal mechanisms by which residents themselves achieve public order. More specifically, this is the shared vision or fusion of shared willingness of residents to intervene and create social trust (the sense of engagement and ownership of public spaces), intervening in the lives of other residents to counter crime, increase voting, or encourage residents to recycle. These informal mechanisms are what he{{who|date=September 2018}} calls ''social capital'', a public good provided by citizens who participate to build up their communities (from raising children and taking care of the elderly to volunteer work). This kind of work is essential{{according to whom|date=September 2018}} to a democratic and stable society.

Unlike a market economy, the core economy relies on specialization reinforced by a "do-it-yourself" attitude that “Builds self-esteem and a voluntary interdependence that replaces involuntary dependence that comes w/ industrial and market specialization”&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt; and where self-sufficiency is based upon interdependent family or community units (instead of a market economy's atomized individual). This model reduces or eliminates the involuntary dependence that comes with the market economy's strict division of labor. It also focuses on alternative distribution mechanisms to pricing, using instead normative considerations like need, fairness, altruism, moral obligation, or contribution.&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;

Collective efficacy and social capital are central to two very successful examples of civic-based, non-monetary economies: [[time banks]] and local exchange trading systems ([[LETS]]). These work systems provide alternative forms of currency, earned through time spent in directly serving the community, e.g. working in the community garden, recycling, repairing leaky faucets, babysitting. These units of time can be used to ask other members of work systems to do jobs they need, or may act as a forum in which special jobs or needs can be communicated and traded. These systems operate to a large degree outside of the monetary economy, though do not negate the importance of a monetary economy or seek a return to systems of barter.&lt;ref name="Peacock" /&gt;

=== Time banks ===
{{Main|Time-based currency}}
A time bank is a community-based organization which brings people and local organizations together to help each other, utilizing previously untapped resources and skills, valuing work which is normally unrewarded, and valuing people who find themselves marginalized from the conventional economy.&lt;ref name="Seyfang 2" /&gt; These are things that family or friends might normally do for each other, but in the absence of supportive reciprocal networks, the time bank recreates those connections. These interactions are based upon the exchange of hours spent on an activity, where [[time dollars]] are the unit of measure/ currency. They are traded for hours of labour, and are redeemable for services from other members.&lt;ref name="Afshar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Afshar|first1=Anna|title=Giving and Receiving in the Nonmonetary Economy: Time Banks|url=https://www.bostonfed.org/commdev/c&amp;b/2005/fall/nonmonetary.pdf|website=www.bostonfed.org|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community building ===
In 1998, Redefining Progress estimated that housework amounted to $1.911 trillion, roughly one-fourth of the U.S. GDP that year.&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt; As of 2010, the Bureau of Economic Analysis found that household work, if tracked, would increase the GDP by 26%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bureau of Economic Analyses|title=What is the Value of Household Work?|url=http://blog.bea.gov/2012/06/11/household-work/|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Commerce}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than a decade later, household work continues to provide a key source of foundational support to the domestic economy. Such household work includes cleaning, cooking, care giving, and educating children.

There may be a [[closed household economy]], where a specific (perhaps familial) group of individuals benefits from the work performed.

In extreme cases of survival, the open nature of the household economy is most evident. Food, clothing, toiletries, and basic necessities were often shared or exchanged amongst war-torn, impoverished families in East Europe post-communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Adrian|title=Culture/Economy and Spaces of Economic Practice: Positioning Households in Post- Communism|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|year=2002|volume=27|issue=2|pages=232–250|jstor=3804544|doi=10.1111/1475-5661.00051}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooking, cleaning, clothes-making, and forms of work may seem to be intuitively thought of as work. An Australian study (1992) determined that an estimated 380 million person-hours per week were spent on these types of unpaid activities, compared to 272 million hours per week at paid work.&lt;ref name="Iron"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ironmonger|first=D. S.|title=Counting Outputs, Capital Inputs and Caring Labor: estimating Gross Household Product|journal=Feminist Economics|year=1996|volume=2|issue=3|pages=37–64|doi=10.1080/13545709610001707756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large portion of these hours can be attributed to nurturing. Nurturing can take two forms, in terms of raising children and nursing the sick, elderly, and infirm, both still usually expected from women and girls.&lt;ref name="Iron" /&gt; Children represent not only a product of a household but an asset to the community as a whole. In the home, kids may provide help in the form of chores and so are an asset. In a greater sense, children are a public good: an investment in which time, energy, and money are spent so that they can become stable adults who share in reducing national debt and contributing to Social Security, thus a public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Folbre|first=Nancy|title=Children as Public Goods|journal=The American Economic Review|date=May 1994|volume=84|issue=2|jstor=2117807}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aschildren mature and learn, they have the potential to benefit society in whatever profession or products they eventually produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vila|first=Luis E.|title=The Non-Monetary Benefits of Education|journal=European Journal of Education|year=2000|volume=35|issue=1|pages=21–32|jstor=1503615|doi=10.1111/1467-3435.00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The products and services produced within a home are open to the non-market economy at large. Society as a whole benefits from this unpaid work, whether in an immediate manner or a more abstract, macro scale. 

The other form of home-based nurturing also serves benefits society as a whole. ''Care giving'' provides assistance for those who are elderly, disabled, suffering terminal illness or chronic illness, or are generally frail or in need of assistance. Someone who cares for someone in any of these positions is a [[caregiver]]. This is largely provided unpaid by friends or family of the patient.

Care giving often exceeds the nursing tasks that come with caring for someone who is ill or recovering from surgery. Often, caregivers also must maintain the dwelling, provide meals, and interact with medical providers and doctors, among other responsibilities. Nearly 80% of labor that keeps seniors out of nursing homes is unpaid labor by families.&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;

In 1997, the value of work produced by caregivers was estimated at $196 billion. The figure was $375 billion for 2007.&lt;ref name="WM"&gt;{{cite journal|last=White-Means|first=S. I.|author2=Zhiyong, D. |title=Valuing the Costs of Family Caregiving: Time and Motion Survey Estimates|journal=Consumer Interests Annual|year=2012|volume=58|pages=1–8|url=http://www.consumerinterests.org/pdffiles/2012-conference/2012-54%20Valuing%20the%20Costs%20of%20Family%20Caregiving%20-%20Time%20and%20Motion%20Survey%20Estimates.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, only $32 billion was spent on formal health care and $83 billion spent on nursing home care by the federal government.&lt;ref name="Arno"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arno|first=P. S.|author2=Levine, C. |author3=Memmott, M. M. |title=The Economic Value of Informal Care Giving|journal=Health Affairs|year=1999|volume=18|issue=2|pages=182–188|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.18.2.182|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/18/2/182.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these statistics, only half as much money is spent on nursing and home health care as is necessary. These numbers do not take into account the financial burden as well as [[emotion work]] that is an inescapable part of this work.

The same research estimated that in 1997 caregivers would have received $8.18 as the hourly wage.&lt;ref name="Arno" /&gt; As of May 2013, the hourly wage was estimated at $9.14 when averaging the minimum wage in Florida&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Dept. of Labor|title=Minimum Wage Laws in the States - January 1, 2013|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/america.htm#Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the median wage for Home Health Aides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bureau of Labor Statistics|title=Occupational Employment and Wages, May 2012: 31-1011 Home Health Aides|url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes311011.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caregiving requires a large dedication, as much as 22 to 70 hours a week. An estimated 25.8 million people as of 1997 performed these tasks.&lt;ref name="Arno" /&gt;

Caregiving has a disproportionate affect on women and white households.&lt;ref name="WM" /&gt; The cost of caregiving is exorbitant, nearly five times what [[Medicaid]] would have spent on long-term care, meaning only wealthy families can afford to do this type of in-home care. The intersection of class and race in this phenomenon is an important place to explore as less advantaged families will have to rely on government care, potentially at the risk of having less quality care. These statistics also highlight a differential effect on women, showing that women disproportionately do caregiving work.&lt;ref name="WM" /&gt;

Valuing all work changes perceptions of what constitutes valuable work. Acknowledging a non-monetary economy may change the ways in which the unemployed, poor, women, and other stigmatized persons’ work is valued. It can allow citizens to see their community as a more cohesive, intertwined system that deserves their time and energy. Exploring this economy also exposes numerous areas of help that do not have enough support from the public and private sectors. Education and caregiving in particular highlight were assistance is needed and often not provided.

=== Barter economies ===
{{Main article|Barter}}
Barter economies also constitute an important form of non-monetized interaction, although for the most part this kind of interaction is viewed{{by whom|date=September 2018}} largely as a temporary fix as an economic system is in transition. It is also usually considered a side effect of a tight monetary policy such as in a liquidity crisis, like that of 1990s Russia where barter transactions accounted for 50 percent of sales for midsize enterprises and 75 percent for large ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barry|first1=Ellen|title=Have Car, Need Briefs? In Russia, Barter Is Back|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/world/europe/08barter.html?ref=todayspaper&amp;_r=0|work=New York Times|agency=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|date=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy implications ==
The UK in particular has been targeted by the government since the New Labor administration of the mid-1990s onwards—the social economy has been developed as a means of delivering effective public services, and mobilizing active citizenship. In 2002, for example, the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) 2002 launched the Strategy for Social Enterprise to develop “the government’s vision … of dynamic and sustainable social enterprise strengthening an inclusive and growing economy.” The intent of the Strategy was to create an enabling policy environment for social enterprise, to make social enterprises better businesses, and to establish the value of social enterprise, in order that the sector may help to deliver on a range of policy agendas: productivity and competitiveness; contributing to socially inclusive wealth creation; neighborhood regeneration; public service reform; and developing an inclusive society and active citizenship.&lt;ref name="Seyfang 2" /&gt;

However, by and large current policy does not reflect the implications of a system that does not validate actions that transmit community values, provide support, generates consensus, etc. These actions in the past were subsidized by cheap or free labor derived from subordinate groups, like women and ethnic or racial minorities, who as a result of entering the workforce to receive monetary validation negate these positive public goods.&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;

The biggest issue that time bank coordinators face, as a result, is funding. Time banks do not rely on volunteers, but require financial support — to pay the time broker’s salary, for a publicly accessible drop-in office, for marketing costs — to successfully attract socially excluded people in deprived neighborhoods. While many UK time banks have been supported by grant funding from the National Lottery, over time it becomes harder to secure ongoing funding, or to increase the funding available for time banks overall, and established projects close while new ones are begun elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Seyfang 2" /&gt;

=== United States time banks and the IRS ===
Organizations that administer time banks, barter networks, or currencies may register for tax-exempt status under section [[501(c)(3)]] as non-profit organizations working to benefit the community.&lt;ref name="SELC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tax Exemption for Organizations That Administer Time Banks, Barter Networks, or Currencies|url=http://www.communitycurrencieslaw.org/choice-of-entity-and-tax-exemption/|website=www.communitycurrencieslaw.org|publisher=SELC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRS has recognized some time banks as tax exempt; it is harder to obtain exemptions for a barter network or local currency, as they are harder to prove as operating purely on a basis of service to the community.

Being a time bank alone does not enable an organization to obtain tax exemption under 501(c)(3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cahn|first1=Edgar|title=What About Taxes?|url=http://timebanks.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/What-about-taxes_-Edgar-Cahn.pdf|website=www.timebanks.org|publisher=TimeBanks USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; If, instead of a time bank, an organization operates a local currency or barter network, such an organization may be deemed to be operating for the private benefit of individuals, even if those individuals are members of a charitable class. An exchange platform that is designed for use of the broader community, and not specifically for a charitable class, may not be considered a tax-exempt activity for a 501(c)(3) organization.&lt;ref name="SELC" /&gt;

==Pakistani students in South Korea==
Pakistani students studying in South Korean universities are predominantly students of MS and PHD in the fields of science and engineering. Students are the most vibrant segment of Pakistani society in South Korea. They regularly come up with cultural events and activities.  The surge of Pakistani students to South Korea started in 2007 with the induction of large number of HEC scholars in Korean Universities. Since then, Pakistani students have found different kinds of fundings in South Korea. In 2017, the number of Pakistani students in South Korea was estimated to be between 800-1500. The universities with largest number of Pakistani students are [[Sungkyunkwan University]] (nearly 170 students), [[Hanyang University]] (nearly 100 students), [[KAIST]] (nearly 70 students) and UST. Other major universities hosting Pakistani students are [[Sejong University]], [[Kyunghee University]], [[Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology|GIST]], [[Seoul National University]], [[Chungang University]], [[Ajou University]], [[Yonsei University]], [[Kyungpook National University]], [[SUNY Korea]],  and [[Pusan National University]]. Pakistani students generally remain in touch through Facebook groups.

{{Further|Gas depletion|Hubbert peak theory}}
{{Update|gas production having already peaked and being in short supply|date=January 2012}}

According to [[M. King Hubbert]]'s [[Hubbert peak theory]], '''peak gas''' is the point in time at which the maximum global [[natural gas]] (fossil gas) production rate will be reached, after which the rate of production will enter its terminal decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-16049551_ITM Bulls now talking up "Peak Gas" as new cause for long-term concern], Natural Gas Week, 03-06-06&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural gas is a [[fossil fuel]] formed from plant matter over the course of millions of years.  It is a finite resource and thus considered to be a [[non-renewable energy]] source.

The concept of peak gas follows from [[Hubbert peak theory]], which is most commonly associated with [[peak oil]].  Hubbert saw gas, coal and oil as natural resources, each of which would peak in production and eventually run out for a region, a country, or the world.  Since Hubbert's initial predictions in 1956, "the proper application of ever more powerful statistical techniques has reduced much of the uncertainty about the supply of oil and natural gas".{{cn|date = December 2017}}  One view in 1997 was that Hubbert's use of an exponential decline model was statistically adequate in explaining real world data.&lt;ref name=Cleveland1997&gt;{{Cite journal | author1 = Cleveland, C. | author2 = Kaufmann, R. | title = Natural Gas in the US: How Far Can Technology Stretch the Resource Base? | year = 1997 | journal = Energy Journal-Cambridge Ma then Cleveland Oh- | volume = 18 | pages = 89–108 | url = http://www.bu.edu/cees/people/faculty/cutler/articles/Natural_Gas_in_US.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = ENERGY ECONOMICS EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION INC | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080724113716/http://www.bu.edu/cees/people/faculty/cutler/articles/Natural_Gas_in_US.pdf | archivedate = 24 July 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, longer-term experience has shown the predictions to be incorrect.

== Gas demand ==
[[File:Natural gas consumption.png|thumb|right|Natural gas consumption (billions of cubic meters)]]

The world gets almost one quarter of its energy from natural gas.  The consumption of natural gas has nearly doubled in the last 30 years.  The most important energy agencies in the world are forecasting increases in natural gas demand in the next 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unctad.org/infocomm/anglais/gas/market.htm |title=Natural Gas Market |publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development |accessdate=20 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928150524/http://www.unctad.org/infocomm/anglais/gas/market.htm |archivedate=28 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest increments in future gas demand are expected to come from developing countries.

== Gas supply ==
[[File:World Gas Reserves.png|thumb|World natural gas proved reserves 1980-2011 (US EIA)]]

Hubbert’s original peak theory predicts that natural gas will experience three equally spaced events: first, the rate of discoveries will peak, then X years later reserves will peak, and finally X years after peak reserves, gas production will peak at the same rate as the previous peak of discoveries.  For the United States, for instance, Hubbert projected that the natural gas discovery rate was peaking in 1962 at about 20 trillion cubic feet (TCF) per year. From his curves, he predicted that proved reserves would peak eight years later, in 1970, and that production would peak after another eight years, in 1978, at 20 trillion cubic feet per year, about equal to the rate of peak discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;M. King Hubbert, “Energy Resources,” National Academy of Sciences, Publication 1000-D, 1962, p.82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the three peaks, Hubbert found the peak in discoveries most difficult to define, because of large year-to-year scatter, and the phenomenon of “reserve growth.” Initial estimates of a discovery are usually much lower than ultimate recovery, especially if the conservative estimate of [[proven reserves]] is the measure.  As the discovery is drilled out, estimates rise. Sometimes estimates of recoverable oil and gas in a discovery continue to rise for many years after the discovery. To find the peak in discoveries, Hubbert backdated reserve growth to the date of field discovery.&lt;ref&gt;M. King Hubbert, “Degree of advancement of petroleum exploration in the United States,” AAPG Bulletin, Nov. 1967, v.51 n.11, p.2214.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New gas discoveries ===
[[File:Global Giant Gas Discoveries 1900-2000.png|thumb|300px|right|Natural gas discoveries by decade{{citation needed|date = July 2013}}]]

According to David L. Goodstein, the worldwide rate of discovery peaked around 1960 and has been declining ever since.&lt;ref name="Goodstein2004"&gt;{{cite book  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHrv78UlK7wC |title=Out Of Gas: The end of age of oil |author=David L. Goodstein |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |year=2004 |page=128 |isbn=978-0-393-05857-4 |accessdate=30 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exxon Mobil Vice President, Harry J. Longwell places the peak of global gas discovery around 1970 and has observed a sharp decline in natural gas discovery rates since then.&lt;ref name="Longwell2002"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.worldenergysource.com/articles/pdf/longwell_WE_v5n3.pdf |format=PDF |title=The future of the oil and gas industry: past approaches, new challenges |author=Harry J. Longwell |date=December 2002 |publisher=[[World Energy]] |volume=5 |accessdate=30 September 2008 |issue=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003081853/http://www.worldenergysource.com/articles/pdf/longwell_WE_v5n3.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rate of discovery has fallen below the rate of consumption in 1980.&lt;ref name="Goodstein2004"/&gt;  The gap has been widening ever since. Declining gas discovery rates foreshadow future production decline rates because gas production can only follow gas discoveries.

Despite the reported fall in new-field discoveries, world proved reserves of natural gas have continued to grow, from 19 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 1960, 45 bcm in 1970 and 84 bcm in 1980, to a record high 200 bcm in 2012.&lt;ref name="Annual statistical bulletin 2013"&gt;OPEC, [http://www.opec.org/library/Annual%20Statistical%20Bulletin/interactive/current/FileZ/Main.htm Annual statistical bulletin 2013].&lt;/ref&gt; A researcher for the US [[Energy Information Administration]] pointed out that after the first wave of discoveries in an area, most oil and natural gas reserve growth comes not from discoveries of new fields, but from extensions and additional gas found within existing fields.&lt;ref&gt;David F. Morehouse, [ftp://eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/feature_articles/1997/intricate_puzzle_oil_gas_reserves_growth/pdf/m07fa.pdf The intricate puzzle of oil and gas reserve growth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806145740/http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/feature_articles/1997/intricate_puzzle_oil_gas_reserves_growth/pdf/m07fa.pdf |date=6 August 2010 }}, US Energy Information Administration, Natural Gas Monthly, July 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Anthony Hayward]] CCMI, chief executive of [[BP]] stated in October 2009 that proven natural gas reserves around the world have risen to {{convert|1.2|Toilbbl|km3}} of oil equivalent, enough for 60 years' supply if consumption is non-increasing,  and that gas reserves are trending upward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/6299291/Energy-crisis-is-postponed-as-new-gas-rescues-the-world.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Energy crisis is postponed as new gas rescues the world | first=Ambrose | last=Evans-Pritchard | date=11 October 2009 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar situation exists with oil reserves in that they have increased despite the actual declines of worldwide discoveries for decades and despite increases in consumption. BP’s former Chief Petroleum Engineer Jeremy Gilbert stated in 2007 that the growth in oil reserves "results largely from distortions created by the..reporting rules of the US Securities and Exchange Commission" that force companies to be overly conservative in their calculation of reserves, but that "even this illusory growth is unlikely to last," because fewer oil reserves are coming under the control of SEC-regulated companies.&lt;ref&gt;David Strahan, [http://www.energybulletin.net/node/38474 The limits to reserves growth], 18 Dec. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Gilbert's statement, proven reserves of both oil and gas have continued to rise, proven oil reserves increasing 23%, from 1.20 trillion barrels in 2007, to 1.48 trillion barrels in 2012.&lt;ref name="Annual statistical bulletin 2013"/&gt;

===Italy===
[[File:Italy natural gas production.png|thumb|Italy gas production 1970-2007]]
Italy's gas consumption is presently third-highest in Europe, behind only Germany and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pepei.pennnet.com/display_article/330194/17/ARTCL/none/none/1/Italy-needs-to-face-up-to-the-future/ |title=Italy needs to face up to the future |publisher=Power Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gas consumption is growing at a steady rate, and gas consumption in 2001 was 50% greater than it was in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geology.cz/geocapacity/participants/italy |title=Country Review Italy |publisher=EU GeoCapacity |date= |accessdate=21 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy’s major oil and gas company is [[Eni]]. Formerly state-owned, it was privatized during the 1990s, but the government still retains around one-third of the shares. Natural gas reserves in Italy were 164 billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at the beginning of 2007. Natural gas production in 2005 was 11.5 billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, while consumption was 82.6 billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The difference was imported. The primary sources of imported gas are Algeria, Russia and the Netherlands.

===Netherlands===

[[Gazprom]], Russia's state-controlled gas monopoly, is a firm which holds 25% of the world's gas reserves.  Gazprom produces the bulk of Russia's gas and exports more than 25% of West Europe's gas needs.  According to Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller on 4 July 2008 Russian gas output was no longer growing but would remain flat for the years 2007 through 2009. Russia produced 556 BCM in 2006 and 548.5 BCM in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/energy-utilities/oil-gas-industry-oil-processing/11489973-1.html |title=The Russian Oil &amp; Gas Producers - Gazprom. |publisher=APS Review Gas Market Trends |date=18 August 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, gas production resumed an upward trend in 2010, and 2012 Russian gas production was higher than it had been in 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=3&amp;pid=3&amp;aid=1 International energy statistics], accessed 21 Sept. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hubbert US Gas.png|thumb|Hubbert's 1962 peak gas prediction (black) versus actual US lower-48 state gas production (red)]]

====Steidle, 1952====
In 1952, Dr. Edward Steidle, Dean of the School of Mineral Industries at [[Pennsylvania State College]], predicted that gas production would soon decline significantly from 1952 rates, so that gas would cease to be a significant energy source by 2002, and possibly as early as 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Steidle, ''Mineral Forecast, 2000 A.D.'' (State College, Penn.: Pennsylvania State College, 1952) 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

====M. King Hubbert====
In 1956, Hubbert used an estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of {{convert|850|e12cuft|km3}} (an amount postulated by geologist [[Wallace Pratt]]) to predict a US production peak of about {{convert|14|e12cuft|km3}} per year to occur "approximately 1970".&lt;ref name=mkinghubbert1956&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |format=PDF |title=Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels 'Drilling and Production Practice' |author=M. King Hubbert |publisher=[[American Petroleum Institute|API]] |page=figure 22 and p.25,36 |date=June 1956 |accessdate=18 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233843/http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pratt, in his EUR estimate (p.&amp;nbsp;96), explicitly included what he called the "phenomenal discovery rate" that the industry was then experiencing in the offshore Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace E. Pratt (1956) "The impact of the peaceful uses of atomic energy on the petroleum industry," in ''Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy'', US Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, p.89-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Hubbert pushed his predicted peak back a few years based on a more optimistic estimation of 1,000 trillion cubic feet of total original reserves. His new peak gas curve predicted a peak in 1978 at slightly more than 20 tcf per year.&lt;ref&gt;M. King Hubbert (1962) Energy Resources, National Academy of Sciences, Publication 1000-D, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt;

US gas production reached a peak in 1973 at about {{convert|24.1|e12cuft|km3}}, and declined overall for the next decade.  But even greater new discoveries in the offshore [[Gulf of Mexico]] than anticipated, and development of "unconventional reserves",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-33573113_ITM | title=British author says world may be close to peak natural gas output | publisher=The Oil Daily | date=15 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved Pratt's EUR estimate to be too low as US gas production rose again.

In 1971, Hubbert revised his peak gas estimate based on updated reserve information.  He revised his estimated ultimate recovery upward to {{convert|1,075|e12cuft|km3}} for the lower 48 states only, and predicted: "For natural gas, the peak of production will probably be reached between 1975 and 1980."&lt;ref&gt;M. King Hubbert, 1971, ''[http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/energypower/ The energy resources of the earth]'' in ''Energy and Power", p.35.  Retrieved on 8 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gas production for the lower 48 states did peak in 1979, and declined for several years, but rose again, and once more Hubbert's assumed EUR of {{convert|1,075|e12cuft|km3|abbr=on}} proved to be too low, as actual lower 48 state production from 1936 through 2012 has already exceeded {{convert|1,265|e12cuft|km3|abbr=on}}, 18%  higher than the estimated EUR of 1,075.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n9010us2a.htm US Energy Information Agency: ''Annual U.S. Natural Gas Gross Withdrawals''(nationwide minus Alaska production)] Retrieved 7 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent US peak predictions====
Economist Doug Reynolds predicted in 2005 that the North American gas peak would occur in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energybulletin.net/11789.html |title=State's consultant says nation is primed for using Alaska gas |publisher=[[Energy Bulletin]] |author=Bill White |date=17 December 2005 |accessdate=2 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609085805/http://www.energybulletin.net/11789.html |archivedate=9 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds revised his forecast in 2009 to include Southern Canada; he predicted that the combined US Lower 48-Southern Canadian gas production would peak in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/2/2/269 |title=North American Natural Gas Supply Forecast: The Hubbert Method Including the Effects of Institutions |publisher=[[MDPI]] |author1=Douglas B. Reynolds  |author2=Marek Kolodziej  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=25 May 2009 |accessdate=25 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hubbert had acknowledged multiple peaks in oil production in Illinois, he used single peak models for oil and gas production in the US as a whole.  In 2008, [[Tad Patzek]] of the University of California rejected the single-peak model, and showed the multiple peaks of past US gas production as the sum of five different Hubbert curves.  He concluded that new technology has more than doubled gas reserves.  His figure 15 shows gas production declining steeply after a probable peak in known cycles in 2008.  However, he refrained from predicting a date after which gas production would begin terminal decline, but noted: "The actual future of US natural gas production will be the sum of known Hubbert cycles, shown in this paper, and future Hubbert cycles." and warned: "The current drilling effort in the US cannot be sustained without major new advances to increase the productivity of tight formations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tad W.

In 2005 Exxon's CEO Lee Raymond said to Reuters that "Gas production has peaked in North America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/Utilities/idUSN2163310420050621 |title=Exxon says N. America gas production has peaked |publisher=Reuters |date=21 June 2005 |accessdate=4 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reuters article continues to say "While the number of U.S. rigs drilling for natural gas has climbed about 20 percent over the last year and prices are at record highs, producers have been struggling to raise output."  North American natural gas production indeed peaked in 2001 at {{convert|27.5|e12cuft|km3|abbr=on}} per year, and declined to {{convert|26.1|e12cuft|km3|abbr=on}} by 2005, but then rose again in 2006 and 2007 to a new high of {{convert|27.9|e12cuft|km3|abbr=on}}in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/international/RecentNaturalGasProductionTCF.xls US Energy Information Administration: ''World dry natural gas production''] Retrieved 7 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This would make the 2007 figure 1.45% higher than the 2001 figure, for an average annual increase of 0.24% per year during 2001-2007.

[[File:US Natural Gas Production 1990-2040.jpg|thumb|right|The US Energy Information Administration projects US gas production to increase through 2040, due largely to increased shale gas production.]]
In December 2009 the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected US marketed gas production will have reached a first peak at {{convert|20.60|e12cuft|km3|abbr=on}} in 2009, decline to {{convert|18.90|e12cuft|km3|abbr=on}} in 2013, then rise again to {{convert|23.27|e12cuft|km3|abbr=on}} in 2035, the final year of their projection, for an average annual rate of increase of 0.47% per year during 2009-2035&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/excel/aeotab_13.xls US Energy Information Administration: ''Table 13.

[[File:Henry hub NG prices.svg|thumb|right|250px|Natural gas prices at the [[Henry Hub]] in US Dollars per million BTUs ($/mmbtu) for 2000-2012.]]

The [[natural gas]] crisis is typically described by upward price spikes of natural gas in North America from 2000 to 2008,&lt;ref name=Wiser2004&gt;{{cite web  | last1 = Wiser | first1 = R.  | last2 = Bolinger | first2 = M.  | last3 = St Clair | first3 = M.  | year = 2004  | title = Easing the natural gas crisis: Reducing natural gas prices through increased deployment of renewable  | url = http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=838985  | doi = 10.2172/838985  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the decline in production and the increase in [[Demand (economics)|demand]] for [[electricity]] generation. Gas production in the U.S. fell from {{convert|20,570,295|e6cuft|m3|abbr=on}} in 2001 to {{convert|18,950,734|e6cuft|m3|abbr=on}} in 2005, before rising again in 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n9050us2A.htm | title = U.S. Natural Gas Marketed Production 1900 - 2005 (MMcf) | accessdate =16 July 2007 | publisher = U.S. Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anticipated gas shortage in North America led some, such as former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to advocate increased imports of [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.ca.gov/lng/faq.html California Energy Commission Frequently Asked Questions About LNG]&lt;/ref&gt; However, record high natural gas production rates and proved reserves in the US have put LNG imports on hold, and even spawned projects for LNG exports from North America. As of April 2015, ten LNG export terminals had been approved and six are under construction in the US and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;US [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]], [http://www.ferc.gov/industries/gas/indus-act/lng/lng-approved.pdf], 14 April March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Estimates of total reserve base====
The Potential Gas Committee, a non-profit group at the [[Colorado School of Mines]], estimated US natural gas resources to be {{convert|1,525|e12cuft|km3}} in 2007 (86 times current annual consumption) and in 2009 raised their estimate again to {{convert|2,247|e12cuft|km3}} (almost 100 times current annual consumption).  The large increase over previous years' estimates was attributed to a surge in natural gas drilling and exploration spurred by a rise in prices and new technology allowing production from once uneconomic formations, such as shale and coal seams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Ben Casselman|title= US Has Almost 100-Year Supply of Natural Gas|url= http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=77352|date= 17 June 2009|work= [[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher= Rigzone.com|accessdate=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Potential Gas Committee Report Shows Unprecedented Increase in U.S. Natural Gas Resources|url= http://energy.ihs.com/News/natural-gas/2007/potential-gas-report-091907.htm|date= 19 September 2007|work=  |publisher= [[IHS Inc.|IHS]]|accessdate=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Energy Information Administration predicts that world gas production will continue to increase through 2030,
with a total increase of almost 50%, and an average annual rate of increase of 1.6% per year, for the 2006–2030 period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/pdf/table5.pdf US Energy Information Administration: ''Table 5.

In their March 2013 report, "Fossil and Nuclear Fuels – The Supply Outlook", the Energy Watch Group predicted that global natural gas production "will peak around or even before the year 2020".&lt;ref name="EWG_2013_report"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.energywatchgroup.org/fileadmin/global/pdf/EWG-update2013_long_18_03_2013.pdf | publisher=Energy Watch Group | title=Fossil and Nuclear Fuels - The Supply Outlook | page=91 | date=March 2013 | accessdate=1 March 2014 | format=PDF | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126081820/http://www.energywatchgroup.org/fileadmin/global/pdf/EWG-update2013_long_18_03_2013.pdf | archivedate=26 November 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same report (page 75) postulated that US natural gas production had peaked in 2012, and predicted that it would decline steeply after 2015.

{{distinguish|The Gospel of Wealth}}
'''Prosperity theology''' (sometimes referred to as the '''prosperity gospel''', the '''health and wealth gospel''', the '''gospel of success''' or '''seed faith'''){{cref2|A}} is a religious [[Christian theology|belief]] among some Christians, who hold that financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of [[God in Christianity|God]] for them, and that [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth.{{sfn|Wilson|2007|pp=140–142}} Prosperity theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity.{{sfn|Walton|2009|p=94}}

The doctrine emphasizes the importance of personal [[empowerment]], proposing that it is God's will for his people to be happy. It is based on interpretations of the Bible that are mainstream in Judaism (with respect to the Hebrew Bible),{{sfn|Cohen|2009|p=67}} though less so in Christianity.  The [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] (reconciliation with God) is interpreted to include the alleviation of sickness and poverty, which are viewed as [[curse]]s to be broken by faith. This is believed to be achieved through donations of money, visualization, and positive confession.

It was during the [[Healing Revival]]s of the 1950s that prosperity theology first came to prominence in the United States, although commentators have linked the origins of its theology to the [[New Thought]] movement which began in the 19th century. The prosperity teaching later figured prominently in the [[Word of Faith]] movement and 1980s [[televangelism]]. In the 1990s and 2000s, it was adopted by influential leaders in the [[Pentecostal Movement]] and [[Charismatic Movement]] in the United States and has spread throughout the world. Prominent leaders in the development of prosperity theology include [[E. W. Kenyon]], [[Oral Roberts]],  [[A. A. Allen]], [[Robert Tilton]], [[T. L. Osborn]], [[Joel Osteen]], [[Creflo Dollar]], [[Jesse Duplantis]], [[Kenneth Copeland]], [[Reverend Ike]], and [[Kenneth Hagin]]. 

Prosperity theology has been criticized by leaders from various Christian denominations, including within the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements, who maintain that it is irresponsible, promotes [[idolatry]], and is contrary to scripture. Secular observers have also criticized prosperity theology as exploitative of the poor.

== History ==

=== Late 19th and early 20th-century background ===
{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?318386-3/blessed Interview with Kate Bowler on ''Blessed: A History of the American Prosperity Gospel'', March 18, 2014], [[C-SPAN]]}}
According to historian [[Kate Bowler]], the prosperity gospel was formed from the intersection of three different ideologies: [[Pentecostalism]], [[New Thought]], and "an American gospel of pragmatism, individualism, and upward mobility".{{sfn|Bowler|2013|p=11}} This "American gospel" was best exemplified by [[Andrew Carnegie]]'s [[Gospel of Wealth]] and [[Russell Conwell]]'s famous sermon "Acres of Diamonds", in which Conwell equated poverty with [[Christian views on sin|sin]] and asserted that anyone could become rich through hard work. This gospel of wealth, however, was an expression of [[Muscular Christianity]] and understood success to be the result of personal effort rather than divine intervention.{{sfn|Bowler|2013|pp=31–32}}

The New Thought movement, which emerged in the 1880s, was responsible for popularizing belief in the power of the mind to achieve prosperity. While initially focused on achieving mental and physical health, New Thought teachers such as [[Charles Fillmore (Unity Church)|Charles Fillmore]] made material success a major emphasis of the movement.{{sfn|Bowler|2013|p=32}} By the 20th century, New Thought concepts had saturated American popular culture, being common features of both [[self-help]] literature and [[popular psychology]].{{sfn|Bowler|2013|pp=35–36}}

[[E. W. Kenyon]], a [[Baptist]] minister and adherent of the [[Higher Life movement]], is credited with introducing mind-power teachings into early Pentecostalism.{{sfn|Bowler|2013|pp=14,16}} In the 1890s, Kenyon attended [[Emerson College|Emerson College of Oratory]] where he was exposed to the New Thought movement. Kenyon later became connected with well-known Pentecostal leaders and wrote about [[supernatural revelation]] and positive declarations. His writing influenced leaders of the nascent prosperity movement during the post-war American healing revival. Kenyon and later leaders in the prosperity movement have denied that he was influenced by the New Thought movement. Anthropologist [[Simon Coleman (anthropologist)|Simon Coleman]] argues that there are "obvious parallels" between Kenyon's teachings and New Thought.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|pp=44–45}}

Kenyon taught that Christ's [[substitutionary atonement]] secured for believers a right to [[divine healing]]. This was attained through positive, faith-filled speech; the spoken [[Biblical inspiration|word of God]] allowed believers to appropriate the same spiritual power that God used to create the world and attain the provisions promised in Christ's death and resurrection.{{sfn|Bowler|2013|pp=18–19}} Prayer was understood to be a binding, legal act. Rather than asking, Kenyon taught believers to demand healing since they were already legally entitled to receive it.{{sfn|Bowler|2013|p=20}}

Kenyon's blend of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] religion and mind-power beliefs—what he termed "overcoming faith"—resonated with a small but influential segment of the Pentecostal movement.{{sfn|Bowler|2013|p=21}} Pentecostals had always been committed to faith healing, and the movement also possessed a strong belief in the power of speech (in particular [[speaking in tongues]] and the use of the [[Names of God in Judaism|names of God]], especially the [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament|name of Jesus]]).{{sfn|Bowler|2013|pp=23,25}} Kenyon's ideas would be reflected in the teachings of Pentecostal evangelists [[F. F. Bosworth]] and [[John G. Lake]] (who co-led a congregation with New Thought author [[Church of the Truth|Albert C. Grier]] prior to 1915).{{sfn|Bowler|2013|pp=21,23}}

=== Postwar Healing Revivals ===

{{main article|Healing Revival}}

While Kenyon's teachings on overcoming faith laid the groundwork for the prosperity gospel, the first generation of Pentecostals influenced by him and other figures, such as Bosworth, did not view faith as a means to attain material prosperity. In fact, early Pentecostals tended to view prosperity as a threat to a person's spiritual well-being.{{sfn|Bowler|2013|p=30}}{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=40}} By the 1940s and 1950s, however, a recognizable form of the doctrine began to take shape within the Pentecostal movement through the teachings of [[Deliverance ministry|deliverance]] and healing evangelists. Combining prosperity teaching with [[revivalism]] and [[faith healing]], these evangelists taught "the laws of faith ('ask and ye shall receive') and the laws of divine reciprocity ('give and it will be given back unto you')".{{sfn|Robins|2010|p=81}}

[[Oral Roberts]] began teaching prosperity theology in 1947.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=41}} He explained the laws of faith as a "blessing pact" in which God would return donations "seven fold",{{sfn|Robins|2010|p=87}} promising that donors would receive back from unexpected sources the money they donated to him. Roberts offered to return any donation that did not lead to an equivalent unexpected payment.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=41}} In the 1970s, Roberts characterized his blessing pact teaching as the "seed faith" doctrine: donations were a form of "seed" which would grow in value and be returned to the donor.{{sfn|Robins|2010|p=87}}{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=42}} Roberts began recruiting "partners", wealthy donors who received exclusive conference invitations and ministry access in exchange for support.{{sfn|Robins|2010|p=88}}

In 1953, faith healer [[A. A. Allen]] published ''The Secret to Scriptural Financial Success'' and promoted merchandise such as "miracle tent shavings" and [[Pentecostalism#Divine healing|prayer cloth]]s anointed with "miracle oil".{{sfn|Robins|2010|p=85}} In the late 1950s, Allen increasingly focused on prosperity. He taught that faith could miraculously solve financial problems and claimed to have had a miraculous experience in which God supernaturally changed one-dollar bills into twenty-dollar bills to allow him to pay his debts.{{sfn|Harrell|1975|pp=74–75}} Allen taught the "word of faith" or the power to speak something into being.{{sfn|Robins|2010|p=85}}

In the 1960s, prosperity became a primary focus in healing revivals.{{sfn|Harrell|1975|p=105}} [[T. L. Osborn]] began emphasizing prosperity in the 1960s and became known for his often ostentatious displays of personal wealth.{{sfn|Harrell|1975|p=171}} During that decade, Roberts and [[William Branham]] criticized other prosperity ministries, arguing that their fund-raising tactics unfairly pressured attendees. These tactics were prompted in part by the expense of developing nationwide radio networks and campaign schedules.{{sfn|Harrell|1975|p=105}} At the same time, leaders of the Pentecostal [[Assemblies of God USA|Assemblies of God]] denomination often criticized the focus on prosperity taken by independent healing evangelists.{{sfn|Harrell|1975|p=108}}

=== Televangelism ===
[[File:TCC-TBN.jpg|thumb|[[Trinity Broadcasting Network|TBN]] World Headquarters in [[Costa Mesa, California]]]]

During the 1960s, prosperity gospel teachers embraced [[televangelism]] and came to dominate religious programming in the United States. Oral Roberts was among the first, developing a [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] weekly program that became the most watched religious show in the United States. By 1968, television had supplanted the [[tent meeting]] in his ministry.{{sfn|Robins|2010|p=89}}

[[Reverend Ike]], a pastor from New York City, began preaching about prosperity in the late 1960s. He soon had widely aired radio and television programs and became distinguished for his flashy style. His openness about love for material possessions and teachings about the "Science of the Mind" led many evangelists to distance themselves from him.{{sfn|Harrell|1975|pp=234–235}}

In the 1980s, public attention in the United States was drawn to prosperity theology through the influence of prominent televangelists such as [[Jim Bakker]]. Bakker's influence waned, however, after he was implicated in a high-profile scandal.{{refn|name=time}}{{cref2|C}} In the aftermath, [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] (TBN) emerged as the dominant force in prosperity televangelism, having brought [[Robert Tilton]] and [[Benny Hinn]] to prominence.{{sfn|Robins|2010|p=129}}

=== Word of Faith ===

{{main article|Word of Faith}}

Although nearly all of the healing evangelists of the 1940s and 1950s taught that faith could bring financial rewards, a new prosperity-oriented teaching developed in the 1970s that differed from the one taught by Pentecostal evangelists of the 1950s. This "Positive Confession" or "Word of Faith" movement taught that a Christian with faith can speak into existence anything consistent with the will of God.{{sfn|Robins|2010|p=131}}

[[Kenneth Hagin]] was credited with a key role in the expansion of prosperity theology. He founded the RHEMA Bible Training Center in 1974, and over the next 20 years, the school trained more than 10,000 students in his theology.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=30}}{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=29}} As is true of other prosperity movements, there is no theological governing body for the Word of Faith movement, and well-known ministries differ on some theological issues.{{sfn|Billingsley|2008|p=41}} The teachings of Kenneth Hagin have been described by Candy Gunther Brown of [[Indiana University]] as the most "orthodox" form of Word of Faith prosperity teaching.{{sfn|Brown|2011|p=152}}

=== International growth ===
By the late 2000s, proponents claimed that tens of millions of Christians had accepted prosperity theology.{{refn|name=rosin}} The [[Neo-Pentecostal]] movement has been characterized in part by an emphasis on prosperity theology,{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=23}} which gained greater acceptance within [[charismatic Christianity]] during the late 1990s.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=27}} In the 2000s, churches teaching prosperity theology saw significant growth in the Third World.{{sfn|Jenkins|2011|p=99}} According to [[Philip Jenkins]] of [[Pennsylvania State University]], poor citizens of impoverished countries often find the doctrine appealing because of their economic powerlessness and the doctrine's emphasis on miracles.{{sfn|Jenkins|2006|p=95}} One region seeing explosive growth is Western Africa, particularly Nigeria.{{sfn|Jenkins|2011|p=99}} In the Philippines, the [[El Shaddai (movement)|El Shaddai movement]], part of the [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal]], has spread prosperity theology outside Protestant Christianity.{{sfn|Wiegele|2005|p=7}} One South Korean prosperity church, [[Yoido Full Gospel Church]], gained attention in the 1990s by claiming to be the world's largest congregation.{{sfn|Jenkins|2006|p=91}}

A 2006 poll by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that 17% of Christians in America said they identified with the movement.{{refn|name=time}} By the 2000s, adherents of prosperity theology in the United States were most common in the [[Sun Belt]].{{refn|name=rosin}} By 2006, three of the four largest congregations in the United States were teaching prosperity theology, and [[Joel Osteen]] has been credited with spreading it outside of the Pentecostal and Charismatic movement through his books, which have sold over 4 million copies.{{refn|name=time}}{{cref2|D}} [[Bruce Wilkinson]]'s ''[[The Prayer of Jabez]]'' also sold millions of copies and invited readers to seek prosperity.{{sfn|Jenkins|2006|p=91}} There is no official governing body for the movement, though many ministries are unofficially linked.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=30}}

=== Recent history ===
In 2005, [[Matthew Ashimolowo]], the founder of the largely African [[Kingsway International Christian Centre#Charity Commission enquiries|Kingsway International Christian Centre]] in southern England, which preaches a "health and wealth" gospel and collects regular tithes, was ordered by the [[Charity Commission]] to repay money he had appropriated for his personal use. In 2017, the organisation was under criminal investigation after a leading member was found by a court in 2015 to have operated a [[Ponzi scheme]] between 2007 and 2011, losing or spending £8 million of investors' money.{{refn|name=Booth}}

In 2007, [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Chuck Grassley]] opened a probe into the finances of six televangelism ministries that promoted prosperity theology: [[Kenneth Copeland]] Ministries, [[Creflo Dollar]] Ministries, Benny Hinn Ministries, [[Eddie L. Long|Bishop Eddie Long Ministries]], [[Joyce Meyer|Joyce Meyer Ministries]], and [[Paula White|Paula White Ministries]]. In January 2011, Grassley concluded his investigation stating that he believed self-regulation by religious organizations was preferable to government action.{{refn|name=goodstein}}{{cref2|E}} Only the ministries led by Meyer and Hinn cooperated with Grassley's investigation.{{refn|name=goodstein}}

The [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]] of [[Donald Trump]] as the 45th [[President of the United States]] featured prayers from two preachers known for advocating prosperity theology.{{refn|name=Zoll}} [[Paula White]], one of Trump's spiritual advisers, gave the invocation.{{refn|name=Posner}}

== Theology ==

[[File:Parable of talents.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[parable of the talents]] (as depicted in a 1712 woodcut) is often cited in support of prosperity theology.]]

Prosperity theology teaches that Christians are entitled to well-being and, because physical and spiritual realities are seen as one inseparable reality, this is interpreted as physical health and economic prosperity.{{sfn|Hunt|2000|p=332}}
Teachers of the doctrine focus on personal empowerment,{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=28}} promoting a positive view of the [[spirit]] and [[Human body|body]]. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they are made in the [[image of God]] and teach that positive confession allows Christians to exercise dominion over their [[Soul in the Bible|souls]] and material objects around them.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=28}} Leaders of the movement view the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] as providing for the alleviation of sickness, poverty, and spiritual corruption;{{sfn|Hunt|2000|p=333}} poverty and illness are cast as curses which can be broken by faith and righteous actions.{{sfn|Jenkins|2006|p=91}} There are, however, some prosperity churches which seek a more moderate or reformed paradigm of prosperity.{{sfn|Brown|2011|p=152}} [[Kirbyjon Caldwell]], pastor of a [[United Methodist Church|Methodist]] mega-church, supports a theology of [[abundant life]], teaching prosperity for the whole human being, which he sees as a path to combating poverty.{{refn|name=time}}{{cref2|B}}

Wealth is interpreted in prosperity theology as a blessing from God, obtained through a spiritual law of positive confession, visualization, and donations.{{sfn|Wilson|2007|pp=141–142}} This process is often taught in almost mechanical terms;{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=28}} [[Kenneth Copeland]], an American author and televangelist, argues that prosperity is governed by laws,{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=30}} while other teachers portray the process formulaically.{{sfn|Hunt|2000|p=333}} Journalists David van Biema and Jeff Chu of ''Time'' have described Word of Faith pastor [[Creflo Dollar]]'s teachings about prosperity as an inviolable contract between God and humanity.{{refn|name=time}}

The prosperity theology teaching of positive confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible is seen as a faith contract between God and believers; God is understood to be faithful and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive confession means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. Positive confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking it brings it into reality.{{sfn|Walton|2009|pp=93–94}}

The teaching is often based on non-traditional interpretations of Bible verses,{{sfn|Hunt|2000|p=333}} the [[Book of Malachi]] often being given special attention. While Malachi has generally been celebrated by Christians for its passages about the messiah, teachers of prosperity theology usually draw attention to its descriptions of physical wealth.{{sfn|Jenkins|2006|p=92}} Frequently quoted verses include:

* {{Bibleverse||Malachi|3:10|NCV}}: {{"'}}Bring to the storehouse a full tenth of what you earn so there will be food in my house. Test me in this,' says the Lord All-Powerful. 'I will open the windows of heaven for you and pour out all the blessings you need.{{'"}} ([[New Century Version|NCV]]){{refn|name=time}}
* {{Bibleverse||Matthew|25:14–30|KJV}}: the [[Parable of the talents or minas|Parable of the talents]]{{refn|name=rosin}}
* {{Bibleverse||John|10:10|KJV}}: {{"'}}I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.{{'"}} ([[King James Version|KJV]]){{refn|name=time}}
* {{Bibleverse||Philippians|4:19|KJV}}: "My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus." (KJV){{sfn|Hunt|2000|p=333}}
* {{Bibleverse|3|John|1:2|KJV}}: "Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth." (KJV){{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=41}}

Prosperity theology casts itself as the reclamation of true doctrine and thus part of a path to Christian dominion over secular society.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=27}} It contends that God's promises of prosperity and victory to Israel in the [[Old Testament]] apply to [[New Covenant|New-Covenant]] Christians today, and that faith and holy actions release this prosperity.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=28}} [[C. Peter Wagner]], a leader of the [[New Apostolic Reformation]], has argued that if Christians take dominion over aspects of society, the Earth will experience "peace and prosperity".{{refn|name=wagner}} Some [[Latin America]]ns who have embraced prosperity theology argue that Christianity has historically placed an unnecessary focus on suffering. They often view this as a [[Roman Catholic]] doctrine that should be discarded and replaced with an emphasis on prosperity.{{sfn|Patterson|Rybarczyk|2007|p=77}} Prosperity theology advocates also argue that biblical promises of blessings awaiting the poor have been unnecessarily spiritualized, and should be understood literally.{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=43}}

=== Practices ===

Prosperity churches place a strong emphasis on the importance of giving. Some services include a teaching time focused on giving and prosperity, including Biblical references to [[tithe|tithing]]; and then a sermon on another topic which follows the offering. Prosperity church leaders often claim a specific blessing can be exchanged for the money being donated to their ministry; some have been reported to instruct worshipers to hold their donations above their heads during the prayer.{{sfn|Klassen|2009|p=133}} &lt;!-- Is this distinctive enough for inclusion here? Prosperity churches may also allot time to pray for sick members of the congregation during services.{{refn|name=b88}}--&gt;

Congregants in prosperity churches are encouraged to speak positive statements about aspects of their lives that they wish to see improved. These statements, known as positive confessions (distinct from confessions of sin), are said to miraculously change aspects of people's lives if spoken with faith.{{sfn|Brown|2011|p=88}} Prosperity churches also encourage people to "live without limits"{{sfn|Walton|2009|p=109}} and cultivate optimism about their lives.{{sfn|Elisha|2011|p=45}} [[T. D. Jakes]], pastor of [[The Potter's House]] non-denominational mega-church, has argued in favor of prosperity, rejecting what he sees as the demonization of success. He views poverty as a barrier to living a Christian life, suggesting that it is easier to make a positive impact on society when one is affluent.{{sfn|Walton|2009|p=109}}

While some prosperity churches have a reputation for manipulating and alienating the poor,{{sfn|Clifton|2009|p=199}} many are involved in social programs. Underlying these programs is a theology of empowerment and human flourishing with the goal of releasing people from a "welfare" or "victim" mentality.{{sfn|Clifton|2009|p=199}} Many prosperity churches hold seminars on financial responsibility. Kate Bowler, an academic who studies prosperity theology, has criticized such seminars, arguing that though they contain some sound advice the seminars often emphasize the purchase of expensive possessions.{{refn|name=rosin}} [[Hanna Rosin]] of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' argues that prosperity theology contributed to the [[Real estate bubble|housing bubble]] that caused the [[late-2000s financial crisis]]. She maintains that home ownership was heavily emphasized in prosperity churches, based on reliance on divine financial intervention that led to unwise choices based on actual financial ability.{{refn|name=rosin}}

Most churches in the prosperity movement are non-denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=30}} Prosperity churches typically reject [[presbyterian polity]] (or governance) and the idea that a pastor should be accountable to [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]; it is common for pastors of prosperity churches to be the highest organizational authority figure.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=95}} Critics, including [[Sarah Posner]] and [[Joe Conason]], maintain that prosperity teachers cultivate [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian organizations]]. They argue that leaders attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority.{{sfn|Posner|Conason|2008|pp=61–62}} Jenkins contends that prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of pastors.{{sfn|Jenkins|2006|p=93}}

== Reception ==

=== Socioeconomic analysis ===
In the United States, the movement has drawn many followers from the [[middle class]]{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=28}} and is most popular in [[Commuter town#Exurbs|commuter towns]] and [[urban areas]].{{refn|name=rosin}} In ''Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism'' Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that the movement was fueled by a prevailing disdain for [[social liberalism]] in the United States that began in the 1970s.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=27}}{{cref2|G}} Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the [[University of Virginia]] has also compared the teaching to [[manifest destiny]],{{refn|name=rosin}} the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the [[Western United States|West]]. [[Marvin Harris]] argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world is a symptom of the [[secularization]] of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the [[American Dream]] by using supernatural power.{{sfn|Harris|1981|p=141}}

[[File:Hillsong church worship01.jpg|thumb|Hillsong Church in [[Sydney]]]]

Prosperity theology has become popular among [[poor Americans]], particularly those who seek personal and social advancement.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=28}} It has seen significant growth in black and Hispanic churches and is particularly popular among immigrants.{{refn|name=rosin}} Apologists for the movement note its ethnic diversity and argue that it encompasses a variety of views.{{refn|name=time}} Joel Robbins of Cambridge University notes that most anthropologists attribute the theology's appeal to the poor—especially in the [[North–South divide|Global South]]—to the fact that it promises security and helps explain capitalism. Simon Coleman developed a theory based on the doctrine's rhetoric and the feeling of belonging it gave parishioners. In a study of the Swedish [[Livets Ord|Word of Life]] Church, he noted that members felt part of a complex gift-exchange system, giving to God and then awaiting a gift in return (either from God directly or through another church member).{{sfn|Robbins|2010|pp=170–171}} [[Hillsong Church]], the largest congregation in Australia, teaches a form of prosperity theology that emphasizes personal success. [[Marion Maddox]] has argued that this message has drawn a significant number of upwardly mobile Australians.{{sfn|Maddox|2012|p=205}}

In a 1998 interview in ''[[Christianity Today]]'', Bong Rin Ro of the [[Asia Graduate School of Theology]] suggested that the growth in popularity of prosperity theology in South Korea reflects a strong "shamanistic influence". Bong pointed to parallels between the tradition of paying [[Korean shamanism|shamans]] for healing and the prosperity theology's contractual doctrine about giving and blessings. Asia's economic problems, he argued, encouraged the growth of the doctrine in South Korea, though he claims it ignores the poor and needy. During the interview, he stated that he saw the problem beginning to be reversed, citing calls for renewed faith and other practices.{{refn|name=ct}} [[David Yonggi Cho|Cho Yong-gi]], pastor of [[Yoido Full Gospel Church]] in Seoul, has been criticized for shamanising Christianity. This criticism has focused on his healing and exorcism ministries and his promise of material blessings. Malaysian Christian writer Hwa Yung has defended Cho's healing and exorcism ministries, arguing that he successfully contextualized the Gospel in a culture where shamanism was still prevalent. However, Hwa criticizes Cho's teaching of earthly blessings for not reflecting a trust in God's daily provision and for their heavy focus on earthly wealth.{{sfn|Hwa|1997|pp=205–209}}

=== Comparisons with other movements ===
Historian [[Carter Lindberg]] of [[Boston University]] has drawn parallels between contemporary prosperity theology and the medieval [[Abuse of indulgences|indulgence trade]].{{sfn|Lindberg|2010|pp=59–60}} Coleman notes that several pre–20th century Christian movements in the United States taught that a holy lifestyle was a path to prosperity and that God-ordained hard work would bring blessing.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=40}}

Coleman has speculated that modern-day prosperity theology borrows heavily from the [[New Thought]] movement, though he admits that the connection is sometimes unclear.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|pp=42–43}} Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the [[cargo cult]] phenomenon.{{sfn|Jenkins|2006|p=91}} While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, he argues that it can also bear similarities to [[Traditional African religion|traditional African religious]] rituals.{{sfn|Jenkins|2006|p=72}} J. Matthew Wilson of [[Southern Methodist University]] compares the movement to [[Black theology]] owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he notes that it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.{{sfn|Wilson|2007|p=142}}

=== Criticism ===
{{see also|Social Gospel}}
Mainstream [[evangelicalism]] has consistently opposed prosperity theology as [[Heresy#Modern era|heresy]]{{refn|name=rosin}} and prosperity ministries have frequently come into conflict with other Christian groups, including those within the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=27}} Critics, such as Evangelical pastor [[Michael Catt]], have argued that prosperity theology has little in common with traditional Christian theology.{{refn|name=cp}} Prominent evangelical leaders, such as [[Rick Warren]],{{refn|name=time}} [[Ben Witherington III]],{{refn|name=time}} and [[Jerry Falwell]],{{refn|name=associatedpress}} have harshly criticized the movement, sometimes denouncing it as heretical.{{refn|name=time}} Warren proposes that prosperity theology promotes the idolatry of money, and others argue that [[Jesus]]' teachings indicate a disdain for material wealth.{{refn|name=time}} In ''Mark: Jesus, Servant and Savior'', [[R. Kent Hughes]] notes that some 1st-century rabbis portrayed material blessings as a sign of God's favor. He cites Jesus' statement in Mark 10:25 that "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God" (KJV) as evidence to oppose such thinking.{{sfn|Hughes|1989|pp=64–65}}

Other critics of the movement assail promises made by its leaders, arguing that the broad freedom from problems they promise is irresponsible.{{sfn|Coleman|2000|p=27}} [[Televangelism|Televangelists]] are often criticized for abusing the faith of their listeners by enriching themselves through large donations.{{refn|name=biema}} Prosperity theology has been opposed for not adequately explaining the poverty of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]]. For instance, some theologians believe that the life and writings of [[Paul the Apostle]], who is believed to have experienced significant suffering during his ministry, are particularly in conflict with prosperity theology.{{sfn|Ciampa|Rosner|2010|p=180}}  [[Cathleen Falsani]], religion writer in an opinion piece in ''The Washington Post'', points to the conflict with basic Christian teachings "Jesus was born poor, and he died poor. During his earthly tenure, he spoke time and again about the importance of spiritual wealth and health. When he talked about material wealth, it was usually part of a cautionary tale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Falsani|first1=Cathleen|title=The Worst Ideas of the Decade: The prosperity gospel|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/opinions/outlook/worst-ideas/prosperity-gospel.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book ''Health, Wealth and Happiness'', theologians David Jones and Russell Woodbridge characterize the doctrine as poor theology.{{sfn|Jones|Woodbridge|2011|p=81}} They suggest that righteousness cannot be earned and that the Bible does not promise an easy life.{{sfn|Jones|Woodbridge|2011|pp=82–84}} They argue that it is inconsistent with the gospel of Jesus and propose that the central message of the gospel should be Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.{{sfn|Jones|Woodbridge|2011|pp=82–84}} Jones and Woodbridge see Jesus' importance as vital, criticizing the prosperity gospel for marginalizing him in favor of a focus on human need.{{sfn|Jones|Woodbridge|2011|pp=85–86}} In another article, Jones criticizes the prosperity theology interpretation of the [[Covenant (biblical)#Abrahamic covenant|Abrahamic covenant]], God's promise to bless Abraham's descendants, arguing that this blessing is spiritual and should already apply to all Christians. He also argues that the proponents of the doctrine misconstrue the atonement, criticizing their teaching that Jesus' death took away poverty as well as sin. He believes that this teaching is drawn from a misunderstanding of Jesus' life and criticizes [[John Avanzini]]'s teaching that Jesus was wealthy as a misrepresentation,{{refn|name=jones}} noting that Paul often taught Christians to give up their material possessions. Although he accepts giving as "praiseworthy",{{refn|name=jones}} he questions the motives of prosperity theology and criticizes the "Law of Compensation",{{refn|name=jones}} which teaches that when Christians give generously, God will give back more in return. Rather, Jones cites Jesus' teaching to "give, hoping for nothing in return".{{refn|name=jones}} Jones and Woodbridge also note that Jesus instructed followers to focus on spiritual rewards, citing his command in Matthew 6:19–20 "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth&amp;nbsp;... But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven" (KJV).{{sfn|Jones|Woodbridge|2011|p=149}} Jones criticizes the doctrine's view of faith: he does not believe that it should be used as a spiritual force for material gain but seen as selfless acceptance of God.{{refn|name=jones}}

In 1980, the [[Assemblies of God USA|General Council of the Assemblies of God]] criticized the doctrine of positive confession,{{sfn|Poloma|1989|p=152}} noting examples of negative confessions in the Bible (where Biblical figures express fears and doubts) that had positive results and contrasting these examples with the focus on positive confessions taught by prosperity theology. The Council argues that the [[Koine Greek|biblical Greek]] word often translated as "confess" literally translates as "to speak the same thing", and refers to both positive and negative confessions.{{sfn|General Council of the Assemblies of God|1980|p=3}} The statement also criticizes the doctrine for failing to recognize the will of God: God's will should have precedence over the will of man,{{sfn|General Council of the Assemblies of God|1980|p=4}} including their desires for wealth, and Christians should "recognize the sovereignty of God".{{sfn|Poloma|1989|p=152}} The statement further criticizes prosperity theology for overlooking the importance of prayer, arguing that prayer should be used for all requests, not simply positive confession.{{sfn|General Council of the Assemblies of God|1980|p=5}} The Council noted that Christians should expect suffering in this life.{{sfn|Poloma|1989|p=152}} They urge readers to apply practical tests to positive confession, arguing that the doctrine appeals to those who are already in affluent societies but that many Christians in other societies are impoverished or imprisoned.{{sfn|General Council of the Assemblies of God|1980|p=8}} Finally, the paper criticizes the distinction made by advocates of prosperity theology in the two Greek words that mean "speaking", arguing that the distinction is false and that they are used interchangeably in the Greek text.{{sfn|General Council of the Assemblies of God|1980|p=8}}{{cref2|F}} The Council accused prosperity theology of taking passages out of context to fulfill its own needs, with the result that doctrine of positive confession is contradictory to the [[holism|holistic]] message of the Bible.{{sfn|General Council of the Assemblies of God|1980|p=9}}

In April 2015, [[The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints|LDS]] apostle [[Dallin H. Oaks]] stated that people who believe in "the theology of prosperity" are deceived by riches. He continued by saying that the "possession of wealth or significant income is not a mark of heavenly favor, and their absence is not evidence of heavenly disfavor". He also cited how Jesus differentiated the attitudes towards money held by the young rich man in Mark 10:17–24, the good Samaritan, and Judas Iscariot in his betrayal. Oaks concluded this portion of his sermon by highlighting that the "root of all evil is not money but the love of money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/the-parable-of-the-sower?lang=eng|title=The Parable of the Sower|author=Elder Dallin H.

In 2015, well known pastor and prosperity gospel advocate Creflo Dollar launched a fundraising campaign to replace a previous private jet with a $65 million Gulfstream G650.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/06/03/pastor-creflo-dollar-might-get-his-65-million-private-jet-after-all/|title=Pastor Creflo Dollar might get his $65 million private jet after all|author=AbOhlheiser|date=June 3, 2015|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the August 16, 2015 episode of his [[HBO]] weekly series ''[[Last Week Tonight]]'', [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] satirized prosperity theology by announcing that he had established his own tax-exempt church, called [[Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption]]. In a lengthy segment, Oliver focused on what he characterized as the predatory conduct of televangelists who appeal for repeated gifts from people in financial distress or personal crises, and he criticized the very loose requirements for entities to obtain tax exempt status as churches under U.S. tax law. Oliver said that he would ultimately donate any money collected by the church to [[Doctors Without Borders]].&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Locker, "[http://time.com/3999933/john-oliver-televangelist-church-alst-week-tonight/ John Oliver Becomes a Televangelist and Finally Starts His Own Church]", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', August 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Antonio Spadaro and Marcelo Figueroa, in the Jesuit journal ''[[La Civilità Cattolica]]'', examined the origins of the prosperity gospel in the United States and described it as a reductive version of the [[American Dream]] which had offered opportunities of success and prosperity unreachable in the [[Old World]]. The authors distinguished the prosperity gospel from [[Max Weber]]'s [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|Protestant ethic]], noting that the protestant ethic related prosperity to religiously inspired austerity while the prosperity gospel saw prosperity as the simple result of personal faith. They criticized many aspects of the prosperity gospel, noting particularly the tendency of believers to lack compassion for the poor, since their poverty was seen as a sign that they had not followed the rules and therefore are not loved by God.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Spadaro | first = Antonio | author-link = Antonio Spadaro | last2 = Figueroa | first2 = Marcelo | date = July 18, 2018 | title = The Prosperity Gospel: Dangerous and Different | journal = La Civilità Cattolica | volume = 2 | issue = 7 | language = English | url = https://laciviltacattolica.com/the-prosperity-gospel-dangerous-and-different/ | accessdate = July 18, 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Spadaro | first = Antonio | author-link = Antonio Spadaro | last2 = Figueroa | first2 = Marcelo | date = July 21, 2018 | title = Teologia della Prosperità.

The '''Quiet Revolution''' ({{lang-fr|Révolution tranquille}}) was a period of intense socio-political and socio-cultural change in the [[Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]], characterized by the effective [[secularization]] of government, the creation of a state-run [[welfare state]] (''état-providence''), and realignment of  into [[Quebec federalism|federalist]] and [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereignist]] factions and the eventual election of a pro-sovereignty provincial government in the 1976 election. The Quiet Revolution typically refers to the efforts made by the Liberal governments of [[Jean Lesage]] (elected in 1960) and [[Robert Bourassa]] (elected in 1970), though given the profound effect of the changes, most provincial governments since the early 1960s have maintained an orientation based on core concepts developed and implemented in that era.

A primary change was an effort by the provincial government to take more direct control over the fields of health care and education, which had previously been in the hands of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It created ministries of [[Ministry of Health and Social Services (Quebec)|Health]] and [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|Education]], expanded the public service, and made massive investments in the public education system and provincial infrastructure. The government further allowed [[trade union|unionization]] of the [[civil service]]. It took measures to increase Québécois control over [[economy of Quebec|the province's economy]] and [[Nationalization|nationalized]] electricity production and distribution and worked to establish the [[Canada Pension Plan|Canada/Quebec Pension Plan]].

The Quiet Revolution was a period of unbridled economic and social development in [[Quebec]] and [[Canada]] and paralleled similar developments in the [[Western world|West]] in general. It was a byproduct of Canada's 20-year post-war expansion and Quebec's position as the leading province for more than a century before and after [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]]. It witnessed particular changes to the built environment and social structures of [[Montreal]], Quebec's leading city. The Quiet Revolution also extended beyond Quebec's borders by virtue of its influence on contemporary Canadian politics. During the same era of renewed Quebecois nationalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |page= 372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; French Canadians made great inroads into both the structure and direction of the federal government and national policy. Moreover, certain facets of the welfare state, as they developed in Quebec in the 1960s, became nationalized by virtue of Quebec's acceptance and promotion. This would include [[rural electrification]] and healthcare initiatives undertaken by [[Tommy Douglas]] in [[Saskatchewan]] twenty years earlier.

== Origins ==
[[File:PlaceDArmes by Msteckiw.jpg|thumb|The hill leading to [[Place d'Armes]] in Montreal, an important historic site of French Canada]]

The Quiet Revolution began with the enacted [[Parti libéral du Québec|Liberal]] provincial government of [[Jean Lesage]], who was elected in the June [[Quebec general election, 1960|1960 provincial election]], shortly after the death of Premier [[Maurice Duplessis]], whose reign was known by some as the [[Grande Noirceur]] (Great Darkness), but viewed by conservatives as epitomizing a religiously and culturally pure Quebec.

Prior to the 1960s, the government of Quebec was controlled by conservative Maurice Duplessis, leader of the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] party. Not all the Catholic Church supported Duplessis—some Catholic unions and members of the clergy criticized him, including Montreal Archbishop [[Joseph Charbonneau]]—but the bulk of the small-town and rural clergy supported him.&lt;ref name="Behiels 1985"&gt;{{cite book |last=Behiels |first=Michael |title=Prelude to Quebec's Quiet Revolution |date=1985 |publisher=McGill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some quoted the Union Nationale slogan ''Le ciel est bleu, l'enfer est rouge'' (The sky (Heaven) is blue, Hell is red) as a reference to the colours of the Union Nationale (blue) and the Liberals (red), the latter accused often of being pro-communist.{{Citation needed |date=April 2014}} [[Radio-Canada]], the newspaper ''[[Le Devoir]]'' and political journal ''[[Cité Libre]]'' were [[intellectual]] forums for critics of the Duplessis government.&lt;ref name="Behiels 1985" /&gt;

Prior to the Quiet Revolution, the province's natural resources were developed mainly by foreign investors.{{Citation needed |date=April 2014}} As an example, the process of mining iron ore was developed by the US-based [[Iron Ore Company of Canada]]. In the spring of 1949, a group of 5,000 asbestos miners went on strike for three months. The 1949 [[Asbestos Strike]] found Quebecer miners united against a nationalist foreign corporation. Those who supported the miners included Monsignor Charbonneau, Bishop of Montreal, the Québécois nationalist newspaper, ''Le Devoir'', and a small group of [[intellectual]] individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Cook. R (1986) ''Canada, Quebec and the uses of Nationalism'' Toronto: McLelland &amp; Stewart Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the second half of the 20th century, the majority of Francophone Quebec workers lived below the poverty line,{{Citation needed |date=April 2014}} and Francophones did not join the executive ranks of the businesses of their own province.{{Citation needed |date=October 2010}} Singer and political activist [[Félix Leclerc]] described this phenomenon, writing, "Our people are the waterboys of their own country."

In many ways, Duplessis's death in 1959, quickly followed by the sudden death of his successor [[Paul Sauvé]], triggered the Quiet Revolution. The [[Parti Libéral du Québec|Liberal Party]], led by [[Jean Lesage]] and campaigning under the slogans ''Il faut que ça change'' ("Things have to change") and ''Maîtres chez nous'' ("Masters of our own house", a phrase coined by ''[[Le Devoir]]'' editor [[André Laurendeau]]), was voted into power within a year of Duplessis's death.

It is generally accepted that the revolution ended before the [[October Crisis]] of 1970, but Quebec's society has continued to change dramatically since then, notably with the rise of the sovereignty movement, evidenced by the election of the sovereignist [[Parti Québécois]] (first in 1976),&lt;ref name="Dickinson Young 324"&gt;{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |page= 324 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the formation of a sovereignist political party representing Quebec on the federal level, the [[Bloc Québécois]] (formed in 1991),&lt;ref name="Dickinson Young 324" /&gt; as well as the 1980 and 1995 Sovereignty Referendums.&lt;ref name="Dickinson Young 327"&gt;{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |page= 327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dickinson Young 354"&gt;{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |page= 354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that the rise of the Quebec sovereignty movement during the 1970s is also part of this period.&lt;ref name="Dickinson Young 324" /&gt;

==Secularization and education==
The [[Constitution Act, 1867|Canadian Constitution of 1867]] made education an area of provincial responsibility. Quebec set up a Ministry of Public Instruction in 1868 but abolished it in 1875 under pressure from the Catholic Church. The clergy believed it would be able to provide appropriate teaching to young people and that the province should not interfere. By the early 1960s, there were more than 1,500 school boards, each responsible for its own programs, textbooks and the recognition of diplomas according to its own criteria.

In addition, until the Quiet Revolution, higher education was accessible to only a minority of French Canadians because of the generally low level of formal education and the expense involved.&lt;ref name=parent&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/scripts/explore.php?Lang=1&amp;elementid=107__true&amp;tableid=11&amp;tablename=theme&amp;contentlong |title= Education in Québec, before and after the Parent reform |author= Mathieu Pigeon |publisher= McCord Museum |accessdate=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], while most of the United States and Canada was enjoying a long period of prosperity and modernization, economic growth was slower in Quebec.{{Citation needed| date=February 2013}} The level of formal schooling among French Canadians was quite low: only 13% finished grade 11, as opposed to 36% of English Canadians. One of the most scathing attacks on the educational system was levelled by Brother [[Jean-Paul Desbiens]], writing under the pseudonym of Frère [[wikt:Untel|Untel]]. The publication of his book ''[[Les insolences du Frère Untel]]'' (1960) quickly sold over 100,000 copies and has come to be recognized as having important impact on the beginning of the Quiet Revolution.{{Citation needed |date=October 2010}}

[[Alphonse-Marie Parent]] presided over a commission established in 1961 to study the education system and bring forth recommendations, which eventually led to the adoption of several reforms, the most important of which was secularization of the education system. In 1964 a [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec) |Ministry of Education]] was established with [[Paul Gérin-Lajoie]] appointed the first Minister of Education since 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Nemni, Max and Monique. ''Young Trudeau: 1919-1944: Son of Quebec, Father of Canada'', [[McClelland and Stewart|Douglas Gibson Books]]. {{ISBN|978-0-7710-6749-5}}, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Although schools maintained their Catholic or Protestant character, in practice they became secular institutions. Reforms included: the age for compulsory schooling was raised from 14 to 16, free schooling until the 11th grade, school boards were reorganized, school curricula were standardized, and [[classical college]]s were replaced with [[CEGEP]]s (publicly funded pre‑university colleges) in 1965, then the [[Université du Québec]] network in 1969—both as an effort to improve access to higher education, geographically and financially.&lt;ref name=parent/&gt;

Also during this period the Ministry of Social Affairs was created, which in June 1985 became the [[Ministry of Health and Social Services (Quebec) |Ministry of Health and Social Services]], responsible for the administration of health and social services in the province.

The Quiet Revolution combined declericalization with the dramatic reforms of [[Vatican&amp;nbsp;II]]. There was a dramatic change in the role of nuns, which previously had attracted 2–3% of Québec's young women. Many left the convent while very few young women entered. The Provincial government took over the nuns' traditional role as provider of many of Quebec's educational and social services. Often ex-nuns continued the same roles in civilian dress; and for the first time men started entering the teaching profession.&lt;ref&gt;Micheline D'Allaire, "Les Religieuses du Quebec dans le Courant de la Laicisation", ''Cultures du Canada Francais'' (1986), Vol. 3, pp 38-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during the time of the Quiet Revolution, Quebec experienced a large drop in the [[total fertility rate]] (known as TFR: the lifetime average number of live births per woman of child-bearing age) falling from 3.8 in 1960 to 1.9 in 1970.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Jean |last1= Bernier |first2= Laurent |last2= Roy |title= Family Policy, Social Trends and Fertility in Québec: Experimenting with the Nordic Model?| publisher= The Quebec Ministry of Families, Seniors and Status of Women |year= 2003 |page= 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study commissioned in 2007 by The Quebec Ministry of Families, Seniors and Status of Women on possible way to address problems related to a by then even lower TFR (1.6) "Starting in 1960, Québec experienced a drop in fertility that was so sharp and rapid, it was almost unparalleled in the developed countries." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Jean |last1= Bernier |first2= Laurent |last2= Roy |title= Family Policy, Social Trends and Fertility in Québec: Experimenting with the Nordic Model?| publisher= The Quebec Ministry of Families, Seniors and Status of Women |year= 2003 |page= 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2003 article "Where Have All the Children Gone?", published in the academic journal ''Canadian Studies in Population'' by Professor Catherine Krull of Queen's University and Professor Frank Trovato of The University of Alberta, point to the decline in influence of the Roman Catholic Church over the lives of French-Canadians as one of the causes of the great reduction in the TFR during the Quiet Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Catherine |last1= Krull |first2= Frank |last2= Trovato |title= Where Have All the Children Gone?| publisher= Canadian Studies in Population |year= 2003 |pages= 197–198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=September 2018}}

== Economic reforms ==
[[File:Manic-2 (2).jpg|right|upright=1.2|thumb|Hydro-Québec's [[Jean-Lesage generating station]], formerly known as Manic-2, built between 1961 and 1965.|alt=A big concrete structure.]]

Seeking a mandate for its most daring reform, the nationalization of the province's electric companies under [[Hydro-Québec]], the Liberal Party called for a new [[Quebec general election, 1962|election in 1962]]. The Liberal party was returned to power with an increased majority in the [[Legislative Assembly of Quebec]] and within six months, [[René Lévesque]], Minister of Natural Resources, enacted his plans for Hydro-Québec. The Hydro-Québec project grew to become an important symbol in Quebec. It demonstrated the strength and initiative of the Quebec government and was a symbol of the ingenuity of Québécois in their capability to complete such an ambitious project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |pages= 319, 350 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Hydro-Québec project ushered in an era of "megaprojects" that would continue until 1984, seeing Quebec's hydroelectric network grow and become a strong pillar of the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |page= 351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Hydro-Québec remains a crucial element to the Quebec economy, with annual revenues of $12.7 billion Canadian dollars, $1.1 billion going directly into the province's coffers.&lt;ref name="Hydro-Québec"&gt;{{cite book |title= Hydro-Québec Annual Report 2008 |publisher= Hydro-Québec |year= 2009 |url= http://www.hydroquebec.com/publications/en/annual_report/pdf/annual-report-2008.pdf |accessdate= September 26, 2009 |issn= 0702-6706 |isbn= 978-2-550-55046-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hydro Québec, building in Montreal 2005-10-21.JPG|thumb|Hydro-Québec headquarters in Montréal]]

More public institutions were created to follow through with the desire to increase the province's economic autonomy. The public companies SIDBEC (iron and steel), SOQUEM (mining), REXFOR (forestry) and SOQUIP (petroleum) were created to exploit the province's natural resources. This was a massive shift away from the Duplessis era in which Quebec's abundant natural resources were hardly utilized. Duplessis' policy was to sell off untransformed natural resources at bargain prices in order to create more employment in Quebec's regions. This strategy, however, proved weak as Quebec's natural resources were exploited for little profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Leandre |last= Bergeron |title= The History of Quebec |location= Toronto |publisher= NC Press |year= 1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift in mentality of the Quiet Revolution allowed Quebec to gain further financial autonomy by accessing this area of the economy which, as is evidenced by Hydro-Québec, is extremely profitable.&lt;ref name="Hydro-Québec" /&gt; The [[Société générale de financement]] (General financing corporation) was created in 1962 to encourage Québécois to invest in their economic future and to increase the profitability of small companies. In 1963, in conjunction with the [[Canada Pension Plan]] the government of Canada authorized the province to create its own ''Régie des Rentes du Québec'' (RRQ, Quebec Pension Plan); universal contributions came into effect in 1966. The [[Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec]] (CDPQ, Quebec Deposit and Investment Fund) was created in 1965 to manage the considerable revenues generated by the RRQ and to provide the capital necessary for various projects in the public and private sectors.

A new labour code (''Code du Travail'') was adopted in 1964. It made unionizing much easier and gave public employees the right to strike. It was during the same year that the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec|Code Civil]]'' (Civil Code) was modified to recognize the legal equality of spouses. In case of divorce, the rules for administering the [[Divorce Act (Canada)|Divorce Act]] were retained using Quebec's old [[community property]] [[matrimonial regime]] until 1980, when new legislation brought an automatic equal division of certain basic family assets between spouses.

==Nationalism==

The societal and economic innovations of the Quiet Revolution, which empowered Quebec society, emboldened certain nationalists to push for political independence.&lt;ref name="Dickinson Young 321"&gt;{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |page= 321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
While visiting Montreal for [[Expo 67]], General [[Charles de Gaulle]] proclaimed ''[[Vive le Québec libre!]]'' in [[Vive le Québec libre speech|a speech]] at Montreal City Hall, which gave the [[Quebec sovereigntism|Quebec independence movement]] further public credibility. In 1968, the [[Quebec sovereigntism|sovereigntist]] [[Parti Québécois]] was created, with [[René Lévesque]] as its leader. A small faction of Marxist sovereignists began terrorist actions as the [[Front de libération du Québec]], the zenith of their activities being the 1970 [[October Crisis]], during which British diplomat [[James Cross]] as well as Labour Minister [[Pierre Laporte]] were both kidnapped by FLQ cells, with Laporte eventually being killed.&lt;ref name="Dickinson Young 321" /&gt;

The Parti Québécois has twice led Quebecers through unsuccessful referendums, the first in 1980 on the question of political sovereignty with economic association to Canada,&lt;ref name="Dickinson Young 327" /&gt; and the second in 1995 on full sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Dickinson Young 354" /&gt;

In 1977, during their first term in office, the Parti Québécois enacted the [[Charter of the French Language]], known in English as Bill 101, whose goal is to protect the French language by making it the language of business in Quebec, as well as restricting the use of English on signs. The bill also restricted the eligibility for elementary and high school students to attend school in English, allowing this only for children of parents who had studied in English in Quebec. Children may also be eligible for English education if their parents or grandparents received a certain amount of English education outside of the province (ex. another Canadian province). Once a child has been permitted to attend an English primary or high school, the remaining children in that family are also granted access.&lt;ref name="Dickinson Young 324" /&gt;

== Historiography==
Several historians have studied the Quiet Revolution, presenting somewhat different interpretations of the same basic facts.  For example,  Cuccioletta and Lubin raised the question of whether it was an unexpected revolution or an inevitable evolution of society.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Cuccioletta and Martin Lubin. "The Quebec quiet revolution: a noisy evolution." ''Quebec Studies'' (2003) 36#1 pp: 125-138.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Behiels|Behiels]] asked, how important are economic factors such as outside control of Quebec's finance  and industry? Was the motivating force one of liberalism or one of nationalism?&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Behiels, ''Prelude to Quebec's Quiet Revolution: Liberalism vs Neo-Nationalism, 1945-60'' (McGill-Queen's Press-MQUP, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Gauvrea raised the issues of religious factors, and of the changes going on inside the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gauvreau, ''Catholic Origins of Quebec's Quiet Revolution, 1931-1970'' (McGill-Queen's Press-MQUP, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Seljak felt that the Catholic Church could have responded with a more vocal opposition.&lt;ref&gt;David Seljak, "Why the quiet revolution was ‘Quiet’: the Catholic church’s reaction to the secularization of nationalism in Quebec after 1960." ''Historical Studies'' (1996) 62#1 pp: 109-24. [http://www.cchahistory.ca/journal/CCHA1996/Seljak.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A revolution or a natural course of action? ===

Modern Quebec historians have brought some nuance to the importance of the Quiet Revolution. Though the improvements made to Quebec society during this era make it seem like an extremely innovative period, it has been posited that these changes follow a logical revolutionary movement occurring throughout North America in the 1960s. Noted Quebec historian [[:fr:Jacques Rouillard|Jacques Rouillard]] took this [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] stance in arguing that the Quiet Revolution may have accelerated the natural evolution of Quebec’s francophone society rather than having turned it on its head.&lt;ref name="Jacques Rouillard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |title=La révolution tranquille, rupture ou tournant? |author=Jacques Rouillard |date=hiver 1998 |work=32:4 |publisher=Journal of Canadian Studies/Revue d’études canadiennes |accessdate=September 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514054757/http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several arguments support this view. From an economic perspective, Quebec’s manufacturing sector had seen important growth since the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Buoyed by significant manufacturing demand during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], the Quebec economy was already expanding before the events of the Quiet Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |title=La révolution tranquille, rupture ou tournant? Section 1 |author=Jacques Rouillard |date=hiver 1998 |work=32:4 |publisher=Journal of Canadian Studies/Revue d’études canadiennes |accessdate=September 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514054757/http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rouillard also argues that traditional portrayals of the Quiet Revolution falsely depict it as the rise of [[Liberalism in Canada|Liberalism in Quebec]]. He notes the popularity enjoyed by federal Liberal Prime Minister [[Sir Wilfrid Laurier]] as well as the Premiership of [[Adélard Godbout]] as examples of Québec Liberalism prior to the events of the Quiet Revolution. The Godbout administration was extremely innovative. Its notable achievements include nationalizing the electricity distribution network of the city of Montreal, granting universal suffrage, instituting mandatory schooling until the age of 14 and establishing various social programs in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |title=La révolution tranquille, rupture ou tournant? Section 2 |author=Jacques Rouillard |date=hiver 1998 |work=32:4 |publisher=Journal of Canadian Studies/Revue d’études canadiennes |accessdate=September 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112200807/http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |archivedate=November 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception of the Quiet Revolution as a great upheaval in Quebec society persists (with significant merit), but the revisionist argument that describes this period as a natural continuation of innovations already occurring in Québec cannot be omitted from any discussion on the merits of the Quiet Revolution.&lt;ref name="Jacques Rouillard"/&gt; The historiography of the period has been notably explored by Ronald Rudin, who describes the legacy of the Lesage years in the depiction of what preceded them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudin|first1=Ronald|title=Revisionism and the Search for a Normal Society: A Critique of Recent Quebec Historical Writing|journal=Canadian Historical Review|date=March 1992|volume=73|issue=1|pages=30–61|doi=10.3138/chr-073-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though criticized as apologists for Duplessis, Robert Rumilly and Conrad Black did add complexity to the narrative of neo-nationalists by contesting the concept of a "Grande Noirceur," the idea that Duplessis's tenure in office was one of reactionary policies and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rumilly|first1=Robert|title=Maurice Duplessis et son temps, Tome II|date=1978|publisher=Fides|location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Conrad|title=Duplessis|date=1977|publisher=McClelland and Stewart|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dale Thomson, for his part, noted that Jean Lesage, far from seeking to dismantle the traditional order, negotiated a transition with (and sought to accommodate) Quebec's Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomson|first1=Dale|title=Jean Lesage and the Quiet Revolution|date=1984|publisher=Macmillan|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars have lately sought to mediate the neo-nationalist and revisionist schools by looking at grassroots Catholic activism and the Church's involvement in policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gauvreau|first1=Michael|title=The Catholic Origins of Quebec's Quiet Revolution, 1931-1970|date=2005|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montreal/Kingston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lacroix|first1=Patrick|title=Immigration, Minority Rights, and Catholic Policy-Making in Post-War Canada|journal=Histoire sociale/Social History|date=May 2014|volume=47|issue=93|pages=183–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Federal politics ====

Politics at the federal level were also in flux. In 1957, the federal government passed the [[Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act]]. This was, effectively, the beginning of a pan-Canadian system of public health insurance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |first1= Ann |last1= Silversides |title= Conversations with Champions of Medicare |location= Ottawa |publisher= Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions |year= 2007 |page= 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc= 1829926 |title= The Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act: Its Impact on Hospital Administration |author= J. Gilbert Turner |date= May 15, 1958 |publisher= Canadian Medical Association Journal |pages= 768–70 |pmid=13523526 |volume=78 |issue=10 |journal=Can Med Assoc J}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Prime Minister Diefenbaker instituted the [[National Hospital Insurance Plan]], the first public health insurance plan adhered to by all the provinces. In 1966, the National Medicare program was created.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Federal politics were further influenced by the election of [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Gordon |last1= Robertson |title= Memoirs of a Very Civil Servant: Mackenzie King to Pierre Trudeau |location= Ottawa |publisher= University of Toronto Press |year= 2007 |page= 253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise to power of arguably Canada's most influential Prime Minister was unique in Canadian politics. The charisma and charm he displayed throughout his whirlwind campaign swept up much of the country in what would be referred to as [[Trudeaumania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Gordon |last1= Robertson |title= Memoirs of a Very Civil Servant: Mackenzie King to Pierre Trudeau |location= Ottawa |publisher= University of Toronto Press |year= 2007 |page= 254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of the 1960s, Trudeau would pass the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]] (1969), which aimed to ensure that all federal government services were available in both of Canada's official languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Gordon |last1= Robertson |title= Memoirs of a Very Civil Servant: Mackenzie King to Pierre Trudeau |location= Ottawa |publisher= University of Toronto Press |year= 2007 |pages= 259–261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1960s, Trudeau had also passed legislation decriminalizing homosexuality and certain types of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/rights_freedoms/topics/538/ |title= Trudeau's Omnibus Bill: Challenging Canadian Taboos |author= The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date= December 21, 1967 |work= |publisher= CBC Digital Archives |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |last=English |first=John |title=Trudeau, Pierre Elliott  |volume=22 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/trudeau_pierre_elliott_22E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Municipal politics ====

Montreal municipal politics were also going through an important upheaval. [[Jean Drapeau]] became Montreal mayor on October 24, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Benoit |last1= Gignac |title= Jean Drapeau: Le maire qui rêvait sa ville |location= Montréal |publisher= La Presse |year= 2009 |page= 105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first few years of his tenure, Drapeau oversaw a series of infrastructure projects, including the expansion of Dorval airport (now [[Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport]]), the opening of the [[Champlain Bridge, Montreal|Champlain bridge]] and the renaissance of [[Old Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Benoit |last1= Gignac |title= Jean Drapeau: Le maire qui rêvait sa ville |location= Montréal |publisher= La Presse |year= 2009 |page= 108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also oversaw the construction and inauguration of [[Place des Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Benoit |last1= Gignac |title= Jean Drapeau: Le maire qui rêvait sa ville |location= Montréal |publisher= La Presse |year= 2009 |page= 111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drapeau was also instrumental in the construction of the [[Montreal metro]] system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Benoit |last1= Gignac |title= Jean Drapeau: Le maire qui rêvait sa ville |location= Montréal |publisher= La Presse |year= 2009 |page= 122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was inaugurated on October 14, 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Benoit |last1= Gignac |title= Jean Drapeau: Le maire qui rêvait sa ville |location= Montréal |publisher= La Presse |year= 2009 |page= 127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Drapeau, Montreal was awarded the 1967 International and Universal Exposition ([[Expo 67]]), whose construction he oversaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Benoit |last1= Gignac |title= Jean Drapeau: Le maire qui rêvait sa ville |location= Montréal |publisher= La Presse |year= 2009 |pages= 133–137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also one of the key politicians responsible for [[National League]] of baseball granting Montreal a franchise, the now-defunct [[Montreal Expos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Benoit |last1= Gignac |title= Jean Drapeau: Le maire qui rêvait sa ville |location= Montréal |publisher= La Presse |year= 2009 |page= 157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Drapeau's major projects was obtaining and holding the [[1976 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Benoit |last1= Gignac |title= Jean Drapeau: Le maire qui rêvait sa ville |location= Montréal |publisher= La Presse |year= 2009 |page= 172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruben "Doc" Cavazos''' (born December 28, 1956) is an [[United States|American]] criminal, and former International President of the [[Mongols (motorcycle club)|Mongols Motorcycle Club]]. His autobiography, ''Honor Few, Fear None: The Life &amp; Times of a Mongol'', was published by [[HarperCollins]] in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgvtribune.com/ci_10801614 |title=Police Knew of Mongols in Suburbs |publisher=Sgvtribune.com |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavazos was raised by his father in [[Highland Park, Los Angeles, California]] and joined the [[The Avenues (gang)|Avenues]], a [[Mexican American]] [[Gang|street gang]], at an early age before serving time in county jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States District Court|website=Mnginteractive.com|url=http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site205/2009/0707/20090707_022007_cavazos.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a license to work as a radiology technician, hence the nickname "Doc".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Honor-Few-Fear-None/Ruben-Cavazos/e/9780061137891/?itm=1 |title=Honor Few, Fear None: The Life and Times of a Mongol |publisher=Search.barnesandnoble.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later became a member of the Mongols and is one of the gang's most infamous members. He has been blamed for turning the club into one of the largest [[criminal organization]]s on the [[West Coast of the United States]] during his time as President. In order to bolster the club's ranks, he also recruited members of street gangs into the club, much to the disgust of the old school bikers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlCf3loTfPQ |title=Bikers Lay Blame As Club Falls |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voted out of the club on August 30, 2008, during a meeting in [[Vernon, California]], due to the majority of the membership believing that he was stealing from the club and provoking a war with the [[Mexican Mafia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agingrebel.com/?p=435 |title=Will Doc Cavazos Flip? |publisher=Agingrebel.com |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August, 2008 he was voted out of the Mongols Motorcycle Club, along with his brother and son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onepercenterbikers.com/ruben-doc-cavazos/ Ruben "Doc" Cavazos] from [http://www.OnePercenterBikers.com One Percenter Bikers].&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2008, Cavazos and 37 other Mongols were arrested by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] after an investigation into the club, known as [[Operation Black Rain]]. Police raided his {{convert|2760|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home in [[South Hills (California)|South Hills]], [[West Covina, California]], where he lived with his son, Ruben "Lil Rubes" Cavazos Jr, and brother, Al "the Suit" Cavazos, and seized firearms and bulletproof vests. After his arrest during the Operation Black Rain, he pleaded guilty to the [[racketeering]] charge. He has been sentenced to 14 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruben Cavazos|website=Biography.com|url=http://www.biography.com/people/ruben-cavazos-21241549#president-of-the-mongols-motorcycle-club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sabaot Land Defence Force''' (SLDF) was a guerrilla militia operating in the [[Mount Elgon District]] of [[Kenya]] since 2005. It had been accused of killing more than 600 people, and of committing a variety of atrocities including murder, torture, rape, and the theft and destruction of property.&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=3 April 2007|title=Kenya: Army and Rebel Militia Commit War Crimes in Mt.

Commentators had attributed the outbreaks of violence and rise of the militias to several factors: conflict over scarce land resources, widespread unemployment among young men, and a fast-growing population (50% of the Kenyan population is aged below 16).&lt;ref name="unreportedworld"/&gt; In local tradition it had been considered good for a man to have as many children as possible, and international [[aid agencies]] which receive any portion of funding from the US federal government have been prohibited from providing advice on [[family planning]].&lt;ref name="unreportedworld"&gt;{{cite news|title=Unreported World – 10/10 – Kenya's Human Time Bomb|date=22 April 2008|publisher=Channel 4|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/ontv/unreported_world/kenyas+human+time+bomb/2036247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/16/aids.usa|title=George Bush's Aids relief plan is undermined by morality clauses|date=16 April 2008|author=Nina O'Farrell|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|title=Abortion battle shifts to aid for family planning|author=Robin Toner|date=5 February 1986|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9A0DEFDE113EF936A35751C0A960948260}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in a fast-growing population which is stressing agricultural resources. Tensions between different ethnic groups were also manifested in the [[2007–2008 Kenyan crisis]].

==Government response==

The government initially treated the SLDF as common criminals, but has begun to treat them as an organised group. An amnesty offered  equivalent to $2.65&lt;ref&gt;Conversion from https://transferwise.com/gb/currency-converter/ugx-to-gbp-rate?amount=10000&lt;/ref&gt;) to fighters surrendering their weapons, but no weapons were surrendered.&lt;ref name="thestandard"/&gt; Security forces have found it difficult to gain information on the group, due to intimidation and the threat of violence towards the families of those who might come forward with information.

A large scale military assault in March 2008 has resulted in allegations of serious human rights abuses by the Kenya Army, including murder, torture, rape, and arbitrary detention.&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7288900.stm|date=11 March 2008|title=Kenya MPs try to fast-track bills | accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Same-sex marriage''' (also known as '''gay marriage''') is the [[marriage]] of a same-sex couple, entered into in a civil or religious ceremony. The term '''marriage equality''' refers to a political status in which the marriages of same-sex couples and the marriages of opposite-sex couples are recognized as equal by the law.

The introduction of same-sex marriage has varied by jurisdiction, being variously accomplished through legislative change to [[marriage law]], an apex court ruling based on constitutional guarantees of equality, by recognition that the existing marriage laws did not prevent it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koco.com/news/oklahomanews/around-oklahoma/samesex-oklahoma-couple-marries-legally-under-tribal-law/-/12530084/22553184/-/101ihp0z/-/index.html |title=Same-sex Oklahoma couple marries legally under tribal law |publisher=KOCO |date=September 26, 2013 |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by direct popular vote (via [[referenda]] and [[initiative]]s).

A [[#Child suicide|study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015]] revealed that the establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation, resulting in approximately 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States.

===Alternative terms===

The [[AP Stylebook]] recommends the usage of the phrase ''marriage for gays and lesbians'' or the term ''gay marriage'' in space-limited headlines.

===Child suicide===
The establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation. A study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the rate of attempted suicide among all schoolchildren in grades 9–12 declined by 7% and the rate of attempted suicide among schoolchildren of a minority sexual orientation in grades 9–12 declined by 14% in states which established same-sex marriage, resulting in approximately 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States. The researchers took advantage of the gradual manner in which same-sex marriage was established in the United States (expanding from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015) to compare the rate of attempted suicide among children in each state over the time period studied. Once same-sex marriage was established in a particular state, the reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children in that state became permanent. No reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children occurred in a particular state until that state recognized same-sex marriage. The lead researcher of the study observed that "laws that have the greatest impact on gay adults may make gay kids feel more hopeful for the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Difference-in-Differences Analysis of the Association Between State Same-Sex Marriage Policies and Adolescent Suicide Attempts|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2604258|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|volume=171|issue=4|pages=350–356|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.4529|pmid=28241285|pmc=5848493|year=2017|last1=Raifman|first1=Julia|last2=Moscoe|first2=Ellen|last3=Austin|first3=S.

===Parenting===
Professional organizations of psychologists have concluded that children stand to benefit from the well-being that results when their parents' relationship is recognized and supported by society's institutions, e.g. civil marriage. For example, the [[Canadian Psychological Association]] stated in 2006 that "parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally-recognized union."&lt;ref name=cpa2006&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20(1).pdf|title=Marriage of Same-Sex Couples – 2006 Position Statement Canadian Psychological Association|year=2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419195945/http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20%281%29.pdf|archivedate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPA has stated that the stress encountered by gay and lesbian parents and their children are more likely the result of the way society treats them than because of any deficiencies in fitness to parent.&lt;ref name=cpa2006&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20(1).pdf|title=Marriage of Same-Sex Couples – 2006 Position Statement Canadian Psychological Association|year=2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419195945/http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20%281%29.pdf|archivedate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] concluded in 2006, in an analysis published in the journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'':
{{quote|author=The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]|text=''There is ample evidence to show that children raised by same-gender parents fare as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. More than 25 years of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents' sexual orientation and any measure of a child's emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment. Conscientious and nurturing adults, whether they are men or women, heterosexual or homosexual, can be excellent parents. The rights, benefits, and protections of civil marriage can further strengthen these families.''&lt;ref name="aap2006"/&gt;}}

In 2010, a [[Columbia University]] [[Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health|Mailman School of Public Health]] study examining the effects of institutional discrimination on the psychiatric health of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals found an increase in psychiatric disorders, including a more than doubling of [[anxiety disorders]], among the LGB population living in states that instituted bans on same-sex marriage. According to the author, the study highlighted the importance of abolishing institutional forms of discrimination, including those leading to disparities in the mental health and well-being of LGB individuals. Institutional discrimination is characterized by societal-level conditions that limit the opportunities and access to resources by socially disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hasin|first=Deborah|title=Lesbian, gay, bisexual individuals risk psychiatric disorders from discriminatory policies|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-03/cums-lgb030210.php|publisher=[[Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health]]|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psychtoday"&gt;{{cite news|title=New study suggests bans on gay marriage hurt mental health of LGB people|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-sexual-continuum/201003/new-study-suggests-bans-gay-marriage-hurt-mental-health-lgb-people|accessdate=8 November 2010|newspaper=[[Psychology Today]]|date=22 March 2010|author= Brian Mustanski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and journalist [[Jonathan Rauch]] has argued that marriage is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rauch|first=Jonathan|title=For Better or Worse?

New York, NY: Henry Holt and Company, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; The data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to mixed-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and mixed-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated to their ability to provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex parents and carers and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.&lt;ref name="aap2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Herek, Gregory M.

The [[American Psychological Association]] stated in 2004: "Denial of access to marriage to same-sex couples may especially harm people who also experience discrimination based on age, race, ethnicity, disability, gender and gender identity, religion, socioeconomic status and so on." It has also averred that same-sex couples who may only enter into a civil union, as opposed to a marriage, "are denied equal access to all the benefits, rights, and privileges provided by federal law to those of married couples," which has adverse effects on the well-being of same-sex partners.&lt;ref name="psychological"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/gay-marriage.pdf|title=Resolution on Sexual Orientation and Marriage|year=2004|author=[[American Psychological Association]]|accessdate=10 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511190536/http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/gay-marriage.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous polls and studies on the issue have been conducted, including those that were completed throughout the first decade of the 21st century. A consistent trend of increasing support for same-sex marriage has been revealed across the world, often driven in large part by a significant generational gap in support. Polling that that been conducted in developed democracies in the first decade of the 21st century shows a majority of people in support of same-sex marriage. Support for legal same-sex marriage has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race and region of various developed countries in the world.&lt;ref name=Gallup2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Newport|first=Frank|title=For First Time, Majority of Americans Favor Legal Gay Marriage|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/147662/First-Time-Majority-Americans-Favor-Legal-Gay-Marriage.aspx|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Opinion: Nationally|url=http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/wp/who-supports-equality/a-majority-of-australians-support-marriage-equality|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303043929/http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/wp/who-supports-equality/a-majority-of-australians-support-marriage-equality/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 March 2011|publisher=australianmarriageequality.com|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Life in Estonia|url=http://www.globalgayz.com/europe/estonia/gay-life-in-estonia|publisher=globalgayz.com |accessdate=25 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716100828/http://www.globalgayz.com/europe/estonia/gay-life-in-estonia|archivedate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jowit|first=Juliette|title=Gay marriage gets ministerial approval|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/12/gay-marriage-receive-ministerial-approval|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 June 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Most Irish people support gay marriage, poll says|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/02/24/most-irish-people-support-gay-marriage-poll-says|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=PinkNews|date=24 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926032112/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/02/24/most-irish-people-support-gay-marriage-poll-says|archivedate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], continual polling by [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] over the course of more than two decades has shown that support for same-sex marriage has grown rapidly, while opposition has simultaneously collapsed. In 1996, 68% of Americans opposed same-sex marriage, while only 27% supported. In 2018, 67% of Americans supported same-sex marriage, while only 31% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/234866/two-three-americans-support-sex-marriage.aspx|title=Two in Three Americans Support Same-Sex Marriage|website=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient===
A reference to same-sex marriage (by the Egyptians and Canaanites) exists in the [[Talmud]]. The [[Book of Leviticus]] prohibited homosexual relations (Lev. 18:22, 20:13), and the Jewish sages provide the reason for this as being that the Hebrews were warned not to "follow the acts of the land of Egypt or the acts of the land of Canaan." The sages explicitly state: "what did [the Egyptians and Canaanites] do? A man would marry a man and a woman [marry] a woman."&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Joel Roth. [https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/assets/public/halakhah/teshuvot/19912000/roth_homosexual.pdf Homosexuality] ''rabbinicalassembly.org'' 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Child emperor [[Elagabalus]] referred to his [[quadriga|chariot]] driver, a blond slave from [[Caria]] named [[Hierocles (charioteer)|Hierocles]], as his husband.&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, M., ''Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire'', Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; He also married an athlete named Zoticus in a lavish public ceremony in Rome amidst the rejoicings of the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html |title=Cassius Dio — Epitome of Book 80 |website=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Herodian |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/herodian_05_book5.htm |title=Herodian of Antioch, History of the Roman Empire (1961) pp.135-152.

The first Roman emperor to have married a man was [[Nero]], who is reported to have married two other males on different occasions. The first was with one of Nero's own [[Freedman|freedmen]], [[Pythagoras (freedman)|Pythagoras]], with whom Nero took the role of the bride.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, CA., ''Roman Homosexuality: Second Edition'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as a groom, Nero married [[Sporus]], a young boy, to replace the adolescent female concubine he had killed&lt;ref name="dio-history-LXII-28"&gt;Nero missed her so greatly that, on learning of a woman who resembled her, he sent for her and kept her; but later he caused a boy of the freedmen, whom he used to call Sporus, ... "he formally "married" Sporus, and assigned the boy a regular dowry according to contract;" q.v., Suetonius ''Nero'' 28; Dio Cassius '' Epitome '' 62.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62.html |title=Bill Thayer's Web Site |website=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and married him in a very public ceremony with all the solemnities of matrimony, after which Sporus was forced to pretend to be the female concubine that Nero had killed and act as though they were really married.&lt;ref name="dio-history-LXII-28"/&gt; A friend gave the "bride" away as required by law. The marriage was celebrated in both Greece and Rome in extravagant public ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html |title=Cassius Dio — Epitome of Book 62 |website=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted, however, that ''conubium'' existed only between a ''civis Romanus'' and a ''civis Romana'' (that is, between a male Roman citizen and a female Roman citizen), so that a marriage between two Roman males (or with a slave) would have no legal standing in Roman law (apart, presumably, from the arbitrary will of the emperor in the two aforementioned cases).&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, ''The Roman Law of Marriage'' (Oxford, 1969), pp. 24–28; Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), pp. 43–49.; "Marriages where the partners had ''conubium'' were marriages valid in Roman law (''iusta matrimonia'')" [Treggiari, p. 49]. Compare Ulpian (''Tituli Ulpiani'') 5.3–5: "''Conubium'' is the capacity to marry a wife in Roman law. Roman citizens have ''conubium'' with Roman citizens, but with Latins and foreigners only if the privilege was granted. There is no ''conubium'' with slaves"; compare also Gaius (''Institutionum'' 1:55–56, 67, 76–80).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Susan Treggiari, "''matrimonium'' was then an institution involving a mother, ''mater''. The idea implicit in the word is that a man took a woman in marriage, ''in matrimonium ducere'', so that he might have children by her."&lt;ref&gt;Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 342 AD, Christian emperors [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]] issued a law in the [[Theodosian Code]] (''C. Th.'' 9.7.3) prohibiting [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|same-sex marriage in Rome]] and ordering execution for those so married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuefler|first=Mathew|year=2007|title=The Marriage Revolution in Late Antiquity: The Theodosian Code and Later Roman Marriage Law|journal=Journal of Family History|volume=32|pages=343–370|url=http://jfh.sagepub.com/cgi/content/short/32/4/343|doi=10.1177/0363199007304424|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Denmark became the first country to recognize a legal relationship for same-sex couples, establishing [[registered partnership]]s, which gave those in same-sex relationships "most rights of married heterosexuals, but not the right to adopt or obtain joint custody of a child".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rule|first=Sheila|title=Rights for Gay Couples in Denmark|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/02/world/rights-for-gay-couples-in-denmark.html|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=2 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]]{{efn|name=netherlands}} became the first country to establish same-sex marriage by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/05/26/f-same-sex-timeline.html|title=Same-sex marriage around the world|work=CBC News|location=Toronto|date=26 May 2009|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then same-sex marriage has been established by law in [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]] (2003), [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]] (2006), [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]] (2009), [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]] (2009), [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]] (2012), [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in New Zealand|New Zealand]]{{efn|name=nz}} (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] (2015), the [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|United States]]{{efn|name=usa}} (2015), [[Same-sex marriage in the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] (2015), [[Same-sex marriage in Colombia|Colombia]] (2016), [[Same-sex marriage in Finland|Finland]] (2017), [[Same-sex marriage in Malta|Malta]] (2017), [[Same-sex marriage in Germany|Germany]] (2017) and [[Same-sex marriage in Australia|Australia]] (2017).

=====European Court of Human Rights=====
In 2010, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ruled in ''[[Schalk and Kopf v Austria]]'', a case involving an Austrian same-sex couple who were denied the right to marry.&lt;ref name="CASE OF SCHALK AND KOPF v. AUSTRIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-99605|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court found, by a vote of 4 to 3, that their human rights had not been violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strasbourg court rules that states are not obliged to allow gay marriage|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/jun/24/european-court-of-human-rights-civil-partnerships|accessdate=8 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 June 2010|author=Antoine Buyse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Judge Sir [[Nicolas Bratza]], then head of the European Court of Human Rights, delivered a speech in 2012 that signaled the court was ready to declare same-sex marriage a "human right", as soon as enough countries fell into line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay marriage: the French connection|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/9859036/Gay-marriage-the-French-connection.html|accessdate=8 November 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=9 February 2013|author=Christopher Booker|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay marriage politically, rather than ethically motivated|url=http://www.sosogay.co.uk/2013/gay-marriage-politically-rather-than-ethically-motivated|website=So So Gay|publisher=So So Gay Ltd|accessdate=8 November 2013|author=Jamie Clarke|date=6 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006084549/http://sosogay.co.uk/2013/gay-marriage-politically-rather-than-ethically-motivated|archivedate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Nicholas Bratza|url=http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=ODYzMQ==|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131108001904/http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=ODYzMQ==|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 November 2013|website=Press Complaints Commission|publisher=Press Complaints Commission|accessdate=8 November 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] states that: "Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Convention on Human Rights|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf|website=ECHR.coe.int|publisher=European Court of Human Rights|accessdate=25 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703060501/http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf|archivedate=3 July 2014|format=PDF|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; not limiting marriage to those in a heterosexual relationship. However, the ECHR stated in ''Schalk and Kopf v Austria'' that this provision was intended to limit marriage to heterosexual relationships, as it used the term "men and women" instead of "everyone".&lt;ref name="CASE OF SCHALK AND KOPF v. AUSTRIA"/&gt;

=====European Union=====
On 12 March 2015, the [[European Parliament]] passed a non-binding resolution encouraging EU institutions and member states to "[reflect] on the recognition of same-sex marriage or same-sex civil union as a political, social and human and civil rights issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/03/13/ukip-and-tories-abstain-on-eu-motion-to-recognise-same-sex-marriage/|title=UKIP and Tories abstain on EU motion to recognise same-sex marriage|website=PinkNews|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P8-TA-2015-0076+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN|title=Texts adopted - Thursday, 12 March 2015 - Annual report on human rights and democracy in the world 2013 and the EU policy on the matter  - P8_TA-PROV(2015)0076|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-annual-report-on-human-rights-and-democracy-in-the-world-2013-and-the-eu-policy-on-the-matter-motion-8.html|title=Annual report on human rights and democracy in the world 2013 and the EU policy on the matter|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2018, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled, in a case from [[Same-sex marriage in Romania|Romania]], that, under the specific conditions of the couple in question, married same-sex couples have the same residency rights as other married couples in an EU country, even if that country does not permit or recognize same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://apnews.com/561b1bb4ecff48b598eb1c2c20db2735 EU court backs residency rights for gay couple in Romania – AP]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44366898 Same-sex spouses have EU residence rights, top court rules – BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Inter-American Court of Human Rights=====
After a motion lodged by Costa Rica, the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] issued a landmark advisory ruling in favour of same-sex marriage on 9 January 2018, which is expected to facilitate legalisation in several countries in the Americas.{{efn|name=IACHR}}

The Court said that governments "must recognise and guarantee all the rights that are derived from a family bond between people of the same sex". They also said that it was inadmissible and discriminatory for a separate legal provision to be established (such as [[civil union]]s) instead of same-sex marriage. The Court demanded that governments "guarantee access to all existing forms of domestic legal systems, including the right to marriage, in order to ensure the protection of all the rights of families formed by same-sex couples without discrimination". Recognising the difficulty in passing such laws in countries where there is strong opposition to same-sex marriage, it recommended that governments pass temporary decrees until new legislation is brought in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfbaytimes.com/major-advance-marriage-equality-gender-identity-rights-latin-america/ |title="Major Advance for Marriage Equality and Gender Identity Rights in Latin America". ''San Francisco Bay Times'', 2018 January 29 |publisher=Sfbaytimes.com |date= 2018-01-25|accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court issued its ruling in response to a motion brought by Costa Rica in 2016. The Costa Rican Government asked the Court to give its opinion on whether it had an obligation to extend property rights to same-sex couples, and the Court ruled that it did. The Costa Rican Government also wanted to know whether it should allow transgender people to change their name and gender on their identity documents. Again, the Court ruled that it must.

The governments of Costa Rica and Panama have announced that they will fully implement the IACHR ruling.&lt;ref name="panama"/&gt;&lt;ref name="panama1"/&gt; Additionally, on 11 January, the president of the [[Supreme Court of Peru]] and chairman of the country's [[Judiciary of Peru|judiciary]], Duberlí Rodríguez, stated that Peru should abide by the decision.&lt;ref name="peru"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20180112/434230085521/judicatura-peru-debe-respetar-decision-corteidh-sobre-matrimonio-homosexual.html Perú debe respetar decisión CorteIDH sobre matrimonio homosexual] lavanguardia&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 January 2018, Housing Minister Carlos Bruce estimated that same-sex marriage will be allowed in Peru within two years, and several former Supreme Court judges and lawmakers, notably Indira Huilca, stated that same-sex marriage will soon be legal in Peru, regardless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ojo.pe/actualidad/carlos-bruce-matrimonio-gay-pronto-peru-251881/|title=Carlos Bruce hace anuncio: "Matrimonio gay se dará pronto en Perú"|website=ojo.pe|date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://rpp.pe/politica/actualidad/huilca-matrimonio-entre-personas-del-mismo-sexo-debe-implementarse-en-el-peru-noticia-1104560 Huilca: "Matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo debe implementarse en el Perú"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Peruvian Government, however, has yet to issue a formal decision on the matter.

On 29 June 2018, two family judges in [[Cuenca, Ecuador]] ruled that the Civil Registry must issue same-sex marriage licenses on request, stating that the decision of the IACHR trumped the [[Constitution of Ecuador|Ecuadorian Constitution]]'s definition of marriage. The Registry has appealed, but the Constitutional Court has indicated that it is likely to rule in favor of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="ecuador"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.advocate.com/marriage-equality/2018/7/05/ecuadorian-court-rules-marriage-equality|title=Ecuadorian Court Rules for Marriage Equality|date=2018-07-05|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [https://www.ecuavisa.com/articulo/noticias/actualidad/403051-union-gay-seria-reconocida-corte-constitucional Unión gay sería reconocida por Corte Constitucional]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August 2018, the [[Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica|Costa Rican Supreme Court]] delcared Costa Rica's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional, and gave the [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica|Legislative Assembly]] 18 months to reform the law accordingly, otherwise the ban would be abolished automatically. This was in line with the IACHR ruling.&lt;ref name="chinch"/&gt;

Besides Ecuador and Costa Rica, lawsuits regarding same-sex marriage have been filed in El Salvador (halting a proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage),&lt;ref name="el salvador"/&gt; Honduras,&lt;ref&gt;[https://wockner.blogspot.com/2018/06/worldwide-marriage-equality-watch-list.html?m=1 Worldwide Marriage Equality Watch List]&lt;/ref&gt; Panama,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonblade.com/2018/02/16/panama-supreme-court-judge-withdraws-draft-ruling-marriage/ Panama Supreme Court judge withdraws draft ruling against marriage]&lt;/ref&gt; Paraguay (to recognize marriages performed abroad),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hoy.com.py/nacionales/lgtbi-anuncia-presin-a-corte-para-aceptar-unin-igualitaria-y-habr-guerra|title=LGTBI anuncia presión a Corte para aceptar unión igualitaria y habrá ‘guerra’|publisher=Hoy (Paraguay)|date=12 January 2018|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peru,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpp.pe/lima/actualidad/tribunal-constitucional-debate-reconocimiento-de-matrimonio-gay-noticia-1130829 Tribunal Constitucional debate reconocimiento de matrimonio gay realizado en México]&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are under the jurisdiction of the IACHR.

=== Legal recognition ===
====Argentina====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Argentina}}
[[File:Crowd in support of Gay Marriage 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Crowd in support of same-sex marriage in [[Buenos Aires]]]]
On 15 July 2010, the [[Argentine Senate]] approved a bill extending marriage rights to same-sex couples. It was supported by the government of [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] and opposed by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barrionuevo|first=Alexei|title=Argentina Approves Gay Marriage, in a First for Region|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/world/americas/16argentina.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=9 February 2012|date=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls showed that nearly 70% of Argentines supported giving gay people the same marital rights as heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/world/americas/14argentina.html|work=The New York Times|title=Argentina Senate to Vote on Gay Marriage|first=Alexei|last=Barrionuevo|date=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law came into effect on 22 July 2010 upon promulgation by the Argentine President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2010/07/22/cristina-kirchner-signs-bill-legalizing-same-sex-couples-marriage|title=Cristina Kirchner signs bill legalizing same-sex couples' marriage|website=mercopress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina thus became the first country in [[Latin America]], the second in the [[Americas]], and the tenth in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.

====Australia====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Australia}}
Australia became the second nation in [[Oceania]] to legalise same-sex marriage when the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] passed a bill on 7 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-07/same-sex-marriage-bill-passes-house-of-representatives/9235560|title=Same-sex marriage bill passes House of Representatives, paving way for first gay weddings|website=ABC News|date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill received [[royal assent]] on 8 December, and took effect on 9 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-08/same-sex-marriage-legal-after-gg-approval/9239334|title=Same-sex marriage signed into law by Governor-General, first weddings to happen from January 9|website=ABC News|date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ausleg&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017A00129|title=Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017|date=9 December 2017|website=Federal Register of Legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law removed the ban on same-sex marriage which previously existed and followed a [[Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey|voluntary postal survey]] held from 12 September to 7 November 2017, which returned a 61.6% ''Yes'' vote for same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/15/australia-says-yes-to-same-sex-marriage-in-historic-postal-survey|title=Australia says yes to same-sex marriage in historic postal survey|date=15 November 2017|journal=The Guardian|last1=Karp|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same legislation also legalised same-sex marriage in all of Australia's [[States and territories of Australia|external territories]].&lt;ref name=Ausleg/&gt;

====Austria====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Austria}}
Since 1 January 2010, same-sex couples have been allowed to enter registered partnerships (''Eingetragene Partnerschaft'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/austrian-embassy-london/service-for-citizens/civil-status-family/registered-civil-partnerships/|title=Registered (civil) partnerships – Österreichische Botschaft London|first=Außenministerium der Republik|last=Österreich|website=www.bmeia.gv.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2013, the [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Greens]] introduced a bill in the [[National Council (Austria)|Austrian Parliament]] that would legalise same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thinkoutsideyourbox.net/?p=33177|title=Nationalrat: Grüne bringen Antrag zur Ehe-Öffnung für Lesben und Schwule ein|publisher=Thinkoutsideyourbox.net|date=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sent to the Judiciary Committee on 17 December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXV/A/A_00049/index.shtml Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, Änderung]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was supposed to be debated in Autumn 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.ggg.at/index.php?id=62&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=6230&amp;cHash=3d81365a9088534c41b5d7ef6d9b02d5 Abstimmung über Ehe-Öffnung ohne Klubzwang?]&lt;/ref&gt; but was delayed by the ruling coalition.

In December 2015, the Vienna Administrative Court dismissed a case challenging the same-sex marriage ban. The plaintiffs appealed to the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.at/20160323/families-fight-austrias-gay-marriage-ban|title=Families fight Austria's gay marriage ban|date=23 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 2017, the [[Constitutional Court (Austria)|Constitutional Court]] agreed to consider one of the cases challenging the law barring same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ggg.at/2017/10/17/verfassungsgerichtshof-koennte-noch-heuer-die-ehe-in-oesterreich-oeffnen/ |title=Verfassungsgerichtshof könnte die Ehe in Österreich noch dieses Jahr öffnen |publisher=Ggg.at |date=2017-10-17 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/2000066167782/Verfassungsgericht-prueft-Eheoeffnung-fuer-Homosexuelle |title=Verfassungsgericht prüft Öffnung der Ehe für Homosexuelle |publisher=Derstandard.at |date= |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kurier.at/politik/inland/vfgh-prueft-eheoeffnung-fuer-gleichgeschlechtliche-paare-in-oesterreich/292.567.898 |title=VfGH prüft Eheöffnung für gleichgeschlechtliche Paare in Österreich |publisher=Kurier.at |date=2017-10-17 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December 2017, the Court struck down the ban on same-sex marriage as [[unconstitutional]]. Thus, same-sex couples will be allowed to marry from 1 January 2019. The Court also decided that [[civil union]]s will be open for both same-sex and different-sex couples from that date onwards. The Austrian Parliament can, however, choose to pass a bill legalising same-sex marriage before that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vfgh.gv.at/downloads/VfGH_G_258-2017_Press_release_same-sex_marriage.pdf|title=Press release from the Austrian constitution court|last=|first=|date=2017-12-05|work=Distinction between marriage and registered partnership violates ban on discrimination|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/2000069288003/Verfassungsgerichtshof-oeffnet-Ehe-fuer-Homosexuelle-ab-2019 |title=Verfassungsgericht öffnet Ehe für Homosexuelle ab 2019 |publisher=Der Standard.at |date=2017-12-05 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Verfassungsgericht öffnet Ehe für Homosexuelle ab 2019|url=http://derstandard.at/2000069288003/Verfassungsgerichtshof-oeffnet-Ehe-fuer-Homosexuelle-ab-2019|accessdate=5 December 2017|work=Der Standard|date=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutsche Welle"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/gay-marriage-in-austria-approved-by-constitutional-court/a-41654156|title=Gay marriage in Austria approved by Constitutional Court|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=5 December 2017|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/austria-same-sex-gay-marriage-legal-constitutional-court-lgbt-rights-start-date-couples-a8092516.html|title=Austria court legalises same-sex marriage from start of 2019, ruling all existing laws discriminatory|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Harriet|last=Agerholm|date=5 December 2017|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Belgium}}
[[File:Tchemiguel Liège Willy Demeyer.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|The Mayor of [[Liège]], Willy Demeyer, officiating at the wedding of a gay couple]]

Belgium became the second country in the world to legally recognize same-sex marriages when a bill passed by the [[Belgian Federal Parliament]] took effect on 1 June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2003/01/31/Belgium-legalizes-gay-marriage/UPI-46741044012415/|title=Belgium legalizes gay marriage|publisher=UPI|date=31 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Belgium allowed the marriages of foreign same-sex couples only if their country of origin also allowed these unions, however legislation enacted in October 2004 permits any couple to marry if at least one of the spouses has lived in the country for a minimum of three months. A 2006 statute legalized [[LGBT adoption|adoption by same-sex spouses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.euronews.net/2005/12/02/belgium-moves-to-allow-gay-adoption/|title=Belgium moves to allow gay adoption|publisher=Euronews|date=2 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Brazil}}
{{Same-sex marriage map South America|align=left}}
[[Supreme Federal Court|Brazil's Supreme Court]] ruled in May 2011 that same-sex couples are legally entitled to legal recognition of cohabitation (known as {{lang|pt|união estável}}, one of the two possible family entities in Brazilian legislation. It included almost all of the rights available to married couples in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brazil's supreme court recognizes gay partnerships|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/06/us-brazil-gayrights-idUSTRE74503V20110506|accessdate=16 February 2012|agency=Reuters|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between mid-2011 and May 2013, same-sex couples had their cohabitation issues converted into marriages in several Brazil states with the approval of a state judge. All legal Brazilian marriages were always recognized all over Brazil.&lt;ref name="WPost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/brazil-judge-approves-what-appears-to-be-countrys-first-gay-marriage-between-2-men/2011/06/27/AGYN2znH_story.html|title=Brazilian judge gives male couple approval for what court says is country's first gay marriage|date=27 June 2011|work=The Washington Post|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zsXujTvb?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/brazil-judge-approves-what-appears-to-be-countrys-first-gay-marriage-between-2-men/2011/06/27/AGYN2znH_story.html|archivedate=2 July 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, the Court of Bahia equalized marriage in the state of [[Bahia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www5.tjba.jus.br/corregedoria/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=420:uniaohomoafetiva&amp;catid=31:noticias&amp;Itemid=142 |title=Provimento Conjunto trata de união homoafetiva |website=Tribunal de Justiça do Estado da Bahia (official web site of the state supreme court) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927065759/http://www5.tjba.jus.br/corregedoria/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=420%3Auniaohomoafetiva&amp;catid=31%3Anoticias&amp;Itemid=142|archivedate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brasil247.com/pt/247/bahia247/86361/Bahia-já-pode-oficializar-casamento-homoafetivo.htm|language=Portuguese|date=27 November 2012|title=Bahia já pode oficializar casamento homoafetivo|work=brasil247.com|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] likewise had same-sex marriage legalized by court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norma do TJ obriga cartórios de SP a registrar casamento gay|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/1203680-norma-do-tj-obriga-cartorios-de-sp-a-registrar-casamento-gay.shtml|newspaper=Folha de S. Paulo|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriages also became equalized in relation to opposite-sex ones between January 2012 and April 2013 by court order in Alagoas, Ceará, Espírito Santo, the Federal District, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraíba, Paraná, Piauí, Rondônia, Santa Catarina and Sergipe, and in Santa Rita do Sapucaí, a municipality in Minas Gerais. In Rio de Janeiro, the State Court facilitated its realization by district judges in agreement with the equalization (instead of ordering notaries to accept same-sex marriages in demand as all others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virgula.uol.com.br/ver/noticia/lifestyle/2013/04/20/324152-rio-de-janeiro-retira-impedimentos-a-casamento-entre-gays|title=Rio de Janeiro state legalizes gay marriage|date=17 April 2013|accessdate= 22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May 2013, the Justice's [[National Justice Council|National Council of Brazil]] issued a ruling requiring all civil registers of the country to perform same-sex marriages by a 14–1 vote, thus legalizing same-sex marriage in the entire country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/cidades,cnj-obriga-cartorios-a-celebrar-casamento-entre-homossexuais,1031678,0.htm |title=CNJ obriga cartórios a celebrar casamento entre homossexuais |publisher=Estadao.com.br |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2013/05/apos-uniao-estavel-gay-podera-casar-em-cartorio-decide-cnj.html|title=G1 - Decisão do CNJ obriga cartórios a fazer casamento homossexual - notícias em Política|website=Política|accessdate=26 July 2015|date=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jb.com.br/pais/noticias/2013/05/14/cnj-obriga-cartorios-a-converterem-uniao-estavel-gay-em-casamento/|title=Jornal do Brasil|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution came into effect on 16 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.cnj.jus.br/dje/jsp/dje/DownloadDeDiario.jsp?dj=DJ89_2013-ASSINADO.PDF&amp;statusDoDiario=ASSINADO DIÁRIO DA JUSTIÇA CONSELHO NACIONAL DE JUSTIÇA Edição nº 89/2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2013/05/regra-que-obriga-cartorios-fazer-casamento-gay-vale-partir-do-dia-16.html Regra que obriga cartórios a fazer casamento gay vale a partir do dia 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, polls suggested that 47% of Brazilians supported marriage equalization and 57% supported adoption equalization for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portugues.christianpost.com/news/quase-metade-dos-internautas-brasileiros-aprova-o-casamento-gay-15398/ Almost half of Brazilian internet users support gay marriage], christianpost.com; accessed 5 July 2017. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the distinction between same-sex unions that are not termed marriages in relation to same-sex marriage is made, the difference in the numbers of approval and disapproval is still insignificant, below 1%; the most frequent reason for disapproval is a supposed 'unnaturalness' of same-sex relationships, followed by religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telelistas.net/blog/62-das-pessoas-nao-aprovam-o-casamento-gay-segundo-enquete/ 62% of people aren't approving of gay marriage, according to poll – Telelistas] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.gospelmais.com.br/pesquisa-maioria-brasileiros-contra-casamento-gay-55261.html A majority of Brazilians is against same-sex marriage and regards church as the most trustworthy institution, reveals research – Gospel+] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Canada}}
Legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Canada followed a series of constitutional challenges based on the [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|equality provisions]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. In the first such case, ''[[Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'', same-sex marriage ceremonies performed in [[Same-sex marriage in Ontario|Ontario]] on 14 January 2001 were subsequently validated when the [[common law]], mixed-sex definition of marriage was held to be unconstitutional. Similar rulings had legalized same-sex marriage in eight provinces and one territory when the ''2005 [[Civil Marriage Act]]'' defined marriage throughout Canada as "the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others."

====Colombia====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Colombia}}

In February 2007, a series of rulings by the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia|Constitutional Court]] meant that same-sex couples could apply for all the rights that heterosexual couples have in ''de facto'' unions (''uniones de hecho'').&lt;ref name="2009 ruling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentences/C-029-2009.pdf|title=Decision C-029 of 2009|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-10938.html Colombian court confirms equal rights for same-sex couples], Pink News, 30 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2011, the Constitutional Court of Colombia ordered the Congress to pass the legislation giving same-sex couples similar rights to marriage by 20 June 2013. If such a law were not passed by then, same-sex couples would be granted these rights automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentences/C-577-2011.pdf|title=DECISION C-577/11 The homosexuals have the right to form a family|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/07/27/colombia.gay.marriage/|work=CNN| title=Colombian court says Congress must decide on gay marriage|date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Senator [[Armando Benedetti]] introduced a bill legalizing same-sex marriage. It initially only allowed for civil unions, but he amended the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/articulo-382915-matrimonio-gay-empieza-ser-tramitado-senado "Matrimonio gay" empieza a ser tramitado en Senado]&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate's First Committee approved the bill on 4 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia-politics.com/gay-marriage-bill-passes-first-hurdle/|title=Gay marriage bill passes first hurdle - Colombia Politics|website=Colombia Politics|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.semana.com/nacion/primera-vez-comision-del-congreso-aprueba-matrimonio-gay/189204-3.aspx Por primera vez una comisión del Congreso aprueba el matrimonio gay]&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April 2013, the bill was defeated in the full Senate on a 51–17 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/04/24/uk-colombia-gaymarriage-idUKBRE93N1EJ20130424|publisher=Reuters |title=Colombia lawmakers reject controversial gay marriage bill | date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 2015, a bill to legalize same-sex marriage was introduced in the [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica]] by Deputy Ligia Elena Fallas Rodríguez of the [[Broad Front (Costa Rica)|Broad Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asamblea.go.cr/Centro_de_Informacion/Consultas_SIL/Pginas/Detalle%20Proyectos%20de%20Ley.aspx?Numero_Proyecto=19508 |title=Páginas - Detalle Proyectos de Ley |website=Asamblea.go.cr |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December 2015, the organization Front for Equal Rights (''Frente Por los Derechos Igualitarios'') and a group of deputies presented another bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.cr/2015/12/10/proyecto-de-organizaciones-sociales-para-matrimonio-igualitario-ya-esta-en-la-asamblea-legislativa/ |title=Proyecto de organizaciones sociales para Matrimonio Igualitario ya está en la Asamblea Legislativa – Diario Digital Nuestro País |website=Elpais.cr |date=2015-12-10 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=www.diarioextra.com |url=http://www.diarioextra.com/Noticia/detalle/278377/12-diputados-respaldan-proyecto-de-ley-para-permitir-matrimonio-gay |title=12 Diputados respaldan proyecto de ley para permitir matrimonio gay |publisher=Diario Extra |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/fdicr/docs/proyectoleymatrimonioigualitario_20 |title=Proyecto de Ley Matrimonio Igualitario by Frente por los Derechos Igualitarios |website=Issuu.com |date=2013-06-27 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 February 2016, the [[Supreme Court of Costa Rica|Constitutional Court of Costa Rica]] announced it would hear a case seeking to legalize same-sex marriage in Costa Rica and declare the country's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ameliarueda.com/nota/sala-estudio-recursos-de-inconsticuionalidad-prohibicion-matrimonio-gay|title=Sala IV admite para estudio 2 recursos de inconstitucionalidad contra prohibición de matrimonio gay - AmeliaRueda.com|website=ameliarueda.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] (IACHR) ruled that the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] mandates and requires the recognition of same-sex marriage. The ruling is fully binding on [[Same-sex marriage in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], who within hours agreed to adhere to it and fully implement it. Costa Rican Vice President [[Ana Helena Chacón Echeverría]] announced that the Government would implement the ruling "in its totality". Costa Rica's [[Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones de Costa Rica|Supreme Electoral Court]] (the institution in charge of [[civil registration]], including the issuance of [[marriage certificate]]s) announced that it will obey the ruling of the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights|IACHR]] and will adapt the necessary by-laws once the [[Executive Branch]] notifies the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cerdas|first1=Daniela|title=Registro Civil solo espera notificación del Ejecutivo para adecuar reglas al matrimonio gay|url=http://www.nacion.com/el-pais/gobierno/registro-civil-solo-espera-notificacion-del/2FTLNLISQRCBTEBAMQ6MXYBLQM/story/?rel=none|accessdate=13 January 2018|agency=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official notification was done on 12 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://qcostarica.com/costa-ricas-foreign-ministry-initiates-notification-process-to-execute-court-order-on-gay-marriage/|title=Costa Rica’s Foreign Ministry Initiates Notification Process To Execute Court Order On Gay Marriage|publisher=[[Q Costa Rica]]|date=12 January 2018|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 January, a same-sex couple applied for a marriage certificate. Their marriage was set to be performed on 20 January, and would have been the first same-sex marriage in Costa Rica,&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.nacion.com/el-pais/gobierno/pareja-gay-se-alista-para-dar-el-si-tras/SRU23EOHAFDFJARID4YNKHS4RY/story/ Pareja gay se alista para dar el ‘sí’ tras criterio de la Corte IDH]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the marriage date, however, the Superior Council of Notaries stated that notaries cannot perform same-sex marriages until legislative change or a Supreme Court decision, putting them at odds with the Costa Rican Government and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which stated in its ruling that legislative change is unnecessary and that governments may simply issue an executive decree legalising same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="IACHR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-costarica-lgbt/costa-ricas-first-gay-marriage-suffers-bureaucratic-hitch-idUSKBN1F82O0|title=Costa Rica's first gay marriage suffers bureaucratic hitch|publisher=Reuters|first=Enrique Andres|last=Pretel|date=19 January 2018|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Costa Rican general election, 2018|2018 Costa Rican general election]], the IACHR ruling on same-sex marriage became a prominent issue. [[Carlos Alvarado Quesada]], who supports LGBT rights and favors the implementation of the ruling, won the election with 60.7% of the vote, defeating by wide margin [[Fabricio Alvarado]], a vocal opponent of LGBT rights who was against the implementation of the ruling. On 8 August 2018, the [[Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica|Supreme Court of Costa Rica]] ruled that the prohibition of same-sex marriage in the Family Code is unconstitutional, giving Congress 18 months to reform the law or the prohibition will be automatically lifted without legislation so it will be legal after 26 May 2020.&lt;ref name="chinch"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chinchilla |first1=Sofía |title=Sala IV da 18 meses para que entre en vigencia el matrimonio homosexual |url=https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/politica/sala-iv-da-18-meses-para-que-entre-en-vigencia-el/CZK6BUA5GRFSRJMN7H6H25BLNY/story/ |accessdate=9 August 2018 |agency=La Nación |date=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Denmark}}
On 25 May 1989, Denmark wrote history as the first country to make it legal to be in a registered partnership with one of the same sex. A registered partnership was the same as a civil marriage, but was not seen as marriage in the eyes of the church. Axel and Eigil Axgil were the first ones to get married this way.&lt;ref name="Sabinsky_5/24/2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=SABINSKY | first=SONJA | title=Da Danmark skrev verdenshistorie | website=Jydske Vestkysten | date=May 24, 2014 | url=https://www.jv.dk/livsstil/Da-Danmark-skrev-verdenshistorie/artikel/1750195 | language=no | access-date=November 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2012, the [[Folketing]] (Danish Parliament) approved new laws regarding same-sex civil and religious marriage. These laws permit same-sex couples to get married in the [[Church of Denmark]]. The bills received [[royal assent]] on 12 June and took effect on 15 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanners |first=Peter |title=Gay marriage legalised |url=http://cphpost.dk/news/national/updated-gay-marriage-legalised |accessdate=25 September 2012 |newspaper=The Copenhagen Post |date=7 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818162542/http://cphpost.dk/news/national/updated-gay-marriage-legalised |archivedate=18 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 2015, in the [[Faroe Islands]] (the realm's other constituent country), a same-sex marriage bill entered Parliament (''[[Løgting]]'').

{{main|Same-sex marriage in France}}
Since November 1999, France has had a [[civil union]] scheme known as a [[civil solidarity pact]] that is open to both opposite-sex and same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/N144 Pacte civil de solidarité (Pacs)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Government introduced a bill to legalize same-sex marriage, ''[[Bill 344 (2012)|Bill 344]]'', in the National Assembly on 17 November 2012. Article 1 of the bill defining marriage as an agreement between two people was passed on 2 February 2013 in its first reading by a 249–97 vote. On 12 February 2013, the National Assembly approved the entire bill in a 329–229 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France's parliament passes gay marriage bill|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/02/12/france-gay-marriage-adoption.html|accessdate=24 April 2013|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main right-wing opposition party UMP challenged the law in the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], which had one month to rule on whether the law conformed to the Constitution.

====Germany====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Germany}}

Prior to the legalisation of same-sex marriage, Germany was one of the first countries to legislate [[Civil union|registered partnerships]] (''Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft'') for same-sex couples, which provided most of the rights of marriage. The law came into effect on 1 August 2001, and the act was progressively amended on subsequent occasions to reflect [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|court]] rulings expanding the rights of registered partners.

Same-sex marriage has been legal in Germany since 1 October 2017. A bill recognising marriages and adoption rights for same-sex couples passed the [[Bundestag]] on 30 June 2017 after [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] stated that she would allow her [[CDU/CSU]] parliamentarians a [[conscience vote]] on such legislation, shortly after it was made a requirement for any future coalition by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], the [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]] and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/politik/bundesparteitag-der-spd-schulz-macht-ehe-fuer-alle-zur-koalitionsbedingung-27856194|title=Bundesparteitag der SPD Schulz macht Ehe für alle zur Koalitionsbedingung|work=[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]]|publisher=[[Berliner Zeitung]]|language=de|date=25 June 2017|accessdate=26 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625220038/http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/politik/bundesparteitag-der-spd-schulz-macht-ehe-fuer-alle-zur-koalitionsbedingung-27856194|archivedate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-governing [[SPD]] consequently forced a vote on the issue together with the opposition parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/world/europe/germany-gay-marriage.html|title=Parliament in Germany Approves Same-Sex Marriage|last=Smale|first=Alison|date=30 June 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=30 June 2017|last2=Shimer|first2=David|language=en-US|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703142747/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/world/europe/germany-gay-marriage.html|archivedate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous attempts by smaller parties to introduce same-sex marriage were blocked by the CDU/CSU-led government over several years.

====Iceland====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Iceland}}
Same-sex marriage was introduced in Iceland through legislation establishing a gender-neutral definition of marriage introduced by the Coalition Government of the [[Social Democratic Alliance]] and [[Left-Green Movement]]. The legislation was passed unanimously by the Icelandic [[Althing]] on 11 June 2010, and took effect on 27 June 2010, replacing an earlier system of registered partnerships for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65A3V020100611|title=Iceland passes gay marriage law in unanimous vote|agency=Reuters|date= 11 June 2010|accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2010/06/28/new-gay-marriage-law-in-iceland-comes-into-force/|title=New gay marriage law in Iceland comes into force|work=Icenews|date= 28 June 2010|accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]] and her partner were among the first married same-sex couples in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/iceland/7858150/Iceland-PM-weds-as-gay-marriage-legalised.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Iceland PM weds as gay marriage legalised|date=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in the Republic of Ireland}}
Prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, the ''Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010'' allowed same sex couples to enter civil partnerships. The Act came into force on 1 January 2011 and gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar to, but not equal to, those of civil marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/partnership-laws-come-into-force-1.869456 |title=Partnership laws come into force |publisher=The Irish Times |date=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2015, Ireland held a [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015|referendum]]. The referendum proposed to add to the [[Irish Constitution]]: "marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex". The proposal was approved with 62% of voters supporting same-sex marriage. On 29 August 2015, Irish President [[Michael D. Higgins]] signed the result of the May referendum into law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/president-signs-same-sex-marriage-into-constitution-1.2333882|title=President signs same-sex marriage into Constitution|date=29 August 2015|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made Ireland the first country in the world to approve same-sex marriage at a nationwide referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/vote2015/2015/0523/703205-referendum-byelection/|title=Ireland says Yes to same-sex marriage|journal=Rte.ie|date=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriage became formally legally recognised in Ireland on 16 November 2015.&lt;ref name="legal123"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34810598|title=Same-sex marriage is now legal in Republic of Ireland|journal=BBC News|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malta====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Malta}}
Malta has recognized same-sex unions since April 2014, following the enactment of the ''Civil Unions Act'', first introduced in September 2013. It established civil unions with same rights, responsibilities, and obligations as marriage, including the right of joint adoption and recognition of foreign same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="tvm.com.mt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvm.com.mt/news/aggornat-ryan-u-jamie-jirregistraw-l-ewwel-zwieg-gay-fmalta|title=Aġġornat: Ryan u Jaime jirreġistraw l-ewwel żwieġ gay f'Malta - TVM|website=TVM|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliament of Malta|Maltese Parliament]] gave final approval to the legislation on 14 April 2014 by a vote of 37 in favour and 30 abstentions.

Same-sex couples can marry in [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico City|Mexico City]] and in the states of [[Same-sex marriage in Baja California|Baja California]], [[Same-sex marriage in Campeche|Campeche]], [[Same-sex marriage in Chiapas|Chiapas]], [[Same-sex marriage in Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], [[Same-sex marriage in Coahuila|Coahuila]], [[Same-sex marriage in Colima|Colima]], [[Same-sex marriage in Jalisco|Jalisco]], [[Same-sex marriage in Michoacán|Michoacán]], [[Same-sex marriage in Morelos|Morelos]], [[Same-sex marriage in Nayarit|Nayarit]], [[Same-sex marriage in Puebla|Puebla]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Quintana Roo|Quintana Roo]] as well as in some municipalities in [[Same-sex marriage in Querétaro|Querétaro]]. In individual cases, same-sex couples have been given judicial approval to marry in all other states. Since August 2010, same-sex marriages performed within Mexico are recognized by the 31 states without exception.

On 21 December 2009, [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico City|the Federal District]]'s [[Legislative Assembly of the Federal District|Legislative Assembly]] legalized same-sex marriages and [[gay adoption|adoption by same-sex couples]]. The law was enacted eight days later and became effective in early March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|publisher=MSNBC|title=Mexico City's gay marriage law takes effect|date=4 March 2010|url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35714490/ns/world_news-americas/|accessdate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 August 2010, the [[Mexican Supreme Court]] ruled that while not every state must grant same-sex marriages, they must all recognize those performed where they are legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-10932748|publisher=BBC News|title=Supreme court rules gay weddings valid in all Mexico|date=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 2011, the first two same-sex marriages occurred in [[Quintana Roo]] after it was discovered that Quintana Roo's Civil Code did not explicitly prohibit same-sex marriage,&lt;ref name="QR marriages legal"&gt;{{cite news|author=Brisa Muñoz|publisher=CNN México|title=Dos matrimonios homosexuales se casaron en un municipio conservador|date=2 December 2011|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/12/02/los-matrimonios-del-mismo-sexo-despiertan-polemica-en-quintana-roo|language=Spanish|accessdate=2 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106064114/http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/12/02/los-matrimonios-del-mismo-sexo-despiertan-polemica-en-quintana-roo|archivedate=6 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these marriages were later annulled by the [[Governor of Quintana Roo]] in April 2012.&lt;ref name="QR marriages annulled"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=304595|website=[[Proceso (magazine)|Proceso]]|publisher=Comunicación e Información, S.A. de C.V|title=Anula gobernador de Quintana Roo dos bodas gay; lo acusan de homofóbico|language=Spanish|date=17 April 2012|accessdate=20 April 2012|first=Rosa|last=Santana}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, the Secretary of State of Quintana Roo reversed the annulments and allowed for future same-sex marriages to be performed in the state.&lt;ref name="QR marriages reinstated"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/845171.html|language=Spanish|title=Revocan anulación de bodas gay en QRoo|first=Adriana|last=Varillas|work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|date=3 May 2012|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2014, the Congress of [[Coahuila]] approved adoptions by same-sex couples. A bill legalizing same-sex marriages passed on 1 September 2014, making Coahuila the first state (and second jurisdiction after Mexico City) to reform its Civil Code to allow for legal same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aprueban matrimonios gay en Coahuila|date=1 September 2014|url=http://www.vanguardia.com.mx/apruebanmatrimoniosgayencoahuila-2155742.html|publisher=Vangardia.com.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took effect on 17 September, and the first couple married on 20 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ontopmag.com/article.aspx?id=19500&amp;MediaType=1&amp;Category=24|title=First Gay Couple Marries In Coahuila, Mexico|date=21 September 2014|publisher=On Top Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 2015, the Governor of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] announced that his administration would no longer oppose same-sex marriages in the state. The order was effective immediately, thus making Chihuahua the third state to legalize such unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mexico state of Chihuahua officially approves same-sex marriage|date=2015-06-12|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/mexico-state-chihuahua-officially-approves-same-sex-marriage120615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mexican state to allow same-sex marriage| date=2015-06-12|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/06/12/mexican-state-to-allow-same-sex-marriage/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June 2015, the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation]] released a "jurisprudential thesis" which found state-laws defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman unconstitutional. The ruling standardized court procedures across Mexico to authorize same-sex marriages. However, the process is still lengthy and more expensive than that for an opposite-sex marriage, as the ruling did not invalidate any state laws, meaning same-sex couples will be denied the right to wed and will have to turn to the courts for individual injunctions ({{lang-es|amparo}}). However, given the nature of the ruling, judges and courts throughout Mexico must approve any application for a same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/mexico-supreme-court-opens-door-to-gay-marriage-nationwide/307197801|title=Mexico supreme court says state laws limiting marriage to man and woman unconstitutional|publisher=Minneapolis Star Tribune|date=12 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614004959/http://www.startribune.com/mexico-supreme-court-opens-door-to-gay-marriage-nationwide/307197801|archivedate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official release of the thesis was on 19 June 2015, which took effect on 22 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mexico avalara matrimonio gay partir lunes|date=2015-06-19|url=http://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2015/06/19/nota/4972027/mexico-avalara-matrimonio-gay-partir-lunes|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 2015, following the Supreme Court's ruling striking down district same-sex marriage bans, the Civil Registry of [[Guerrero]] announced that they had planned a collective same-sex marriage ceremony for 10 July 2015 and indicated that there would have to be a change to the law to allow gender-neutral marriage, passed through the state Legislature before the official commencement.&lt;ref name="La Jornada"&gt;{{cite web|author=La Jornada|url=http://www.lajornadaguerrero.com.mx/2015/06/26/index.php?section=sociedad&amp;article=008n1soc|title=A partir de julio, en Guerrero se permitirá casarse a parejas del mismo sexo|publisher=Lajornadaguerrero.com.mx|accessdate=3 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701075751/http://www.lajornadaguerrero.com.mx/2015/06/26/index.php?section=sociedad&amp;article=008n1soc|archivedate=1 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The registry announced more details of their plan, advising that only select registration offices in the state would be able to participate in the collective marriage event.&lt;ref name="collective marriage"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trujillo|first1=Javier|title=Invitan a boda colectiva del mismo sexo en Acapulco|url=http://www.milenio.com/estados/Invitan_a_boda_colectiva_del_mismo_sexo_en_Acapulco_0_545345734.html|accessdate=30 June 2015|publisher=Milenio|date=29 June 2015|location=Acapulco, Mexico|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state Governor instructed civil agencies to approve same-sex [[marriage license]]s.

{{Main|Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands}}
The Netherlands was the first country to extend marriage laws to include same-sex couples, following the recommendation of a special commission appointed to investigate the issue in 1995. A same-sex marriage bill passed the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] and the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] in 2000, taking effect on 1 April 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/20/world/same-sex-dutch-couples-gain-marriage-and-adoption-rights.html|title=Same-Sex Dutch Couples Gain Marriage and Adoption Rights|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 2000|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Caribbean Netherlands|Dutch Caribbean special municipalities]] of [[Bonaire]], [[Sint Eustatius]] and [[Saba]], marriage is open to same-sex couples. A law enabling same-sex couples to marry in these municipalities passed and came into effect on 10 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=18 December 2010|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0028129/geldigheidsdatum_18-12-2010|publisher=[[Cabinet of the Netherlands|Government of the Netherlands]]| title=Aanpassingswet openbare lichamen Bonaire, Sint Eustatius en Saba|date=1 September 2010|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caribbean countries [[Same-sex marriage in Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten|Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten]], forming the remainder of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, do not perform same-sex marriages, but must recognize those performed in the Netherlands proper.

Same-sex marriage became legal in Norway on 1 January 2009 when a gender-neutral marriage bill was enacted after being passed by the Norwegian legislature, the [[Storting]], in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norway adopts gay marriage law|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jko_BIHizUFFqUtmEaUrAEoPXFWw|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[Agence France-Presse]] via [[Google]]|date=11 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913230714/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jko_BIHizUFFqUtmEaUrAEoPXFWw |archivedate=13 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-06-17-gaymarriage_N.htm|title=New law in Norway grants gay couples marriage rights|work=USA Today|location =Washington DC|date=17 June 2008|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway became the first [[Scandinavia]]n country and the sixth country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage. Gender-neutral marriage replaced Norway's previous system of registered partnerships for same-sex couples. Couples in registered partnerships are able to retain that status or convert their registered partnership to a marriage. No new registered partnerships may be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2313762.ece|title=Gays to win marriage rights|first=Nina|last=Berglund|website=Aftenposten|date=14 March 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618014019/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2313762.ece|archivedate= 18 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portugal====

{{See also|De facto union in Portugal}}

Portugal created de facto unions similar to common-law marriage for cohabiting opposite-sex partners in 1999, and extended these unions to same-sex couples in 2001. However, the 2001 extension did not allow for same-sex adoption, either jointly or of stepchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistoriaconmapas.com/war-maps/Same-sex-marriage-Legal-recognition-War-Maps.htm|title=Historia con Mapas|accessdate=26 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082229/http://www.lahistoriaconmapas.com/war-maps/Same-sex-marriage-Legal-recognition-War-Maps.htm|archivedate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2010, Parliament approved a bill legalizing same-sex marriage. The Portuguese President promulgated the law on 8 April 2010 and the law was effective on 5 June 2010, making Portugal the eighth country to legalize nationwide same-sex marriage; however, adoption was still denied for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.57883.com/en/wiki/wiki/people/201502/Same-sex_marriage0_en.57883.com.html|title=Same-sex marriage in Portugal|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, the Portuguese Parliament approved a bill to recognise adoptions rights for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/portugal-sex-adoption-artificial-insemination-35322018|title=International News: Latest Headlines, Video and Photographs from Around the World|first=ABC|last=News|website=go.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/portuguese-parliament-backs-adoption-gay-couples-182121858.html|title=Portuguese parliament backs adoption by gay couples|website=yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/11/20/portugal-just-equalised-its-adoption-laws-for-gay-couples|title=Portugal just equalised its adoption laws for gay couples|website=pinknews.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came into effect in March 2016.

====South Africa====
[[File:Gay troue.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Same-sex wedding in South Africa, 2007]]
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in South Africa}}

Legal recognition of same-sex marriages in South Africa came about as a result of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]]'s decision in the case of ''[[Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie]]''. The court ruled on 1 December 2005 that the existing marriage laws violated the [[Section Nine of the Constitution of South Africa|equality clause]] of the ''[[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]]'' because they discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. The court gave [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] one year to rectify the inequality.

The ''[[Civil Union Act (South Africa)|Civil Union Act]]'' was passed by the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] on 14 November 2006, by a vote of 230 to 41. It became law on 30 November 2006. South Africa became the fifth country, the first in Africa, and the second outside Europe, to legalize same-sex marriage.

====Spain====

[[Spain]] was the third country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage, which has been legal since 3 July 2005, and was supported by the majority of the Spanish people.&lt;ref name="SPTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain approves liberal gay marriage law|publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=1 July 2005|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/07/01/Worldandnation/Spain_approves_libera.shtml|accessdate=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PlanOut&gt;{{cite web|last=Giles|first=Ciaran|title=Spain: Gay marriage bill clears hurdle|publisher=Planetout.com|date=21 April 2005|url=http://www.planetout.com/news/article.html?2005/04/21/5|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227125726/http://www.planetout.com/news/article.html?2005%2F04%2F21%2F5|archivedate=27 December 2007|accessdate=22 December 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Same-sex marriage in Sweden has been legal since 1 May 2009, following the adoption of a new gender-neutral law on marriage by the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish Parliament]] on 1 April 2009, making Sweden the seventh country in the world to open marriage to same-sex couples nationwide. Marriage replaced Sweden's registered partnerships for same-sex couples.

{{main|Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom}}

Since 2005, same-sex couples have been allowed to enter into [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]], a separate union providing the [[Legal consequences of marriage and civil partnership in the United Kingdom|legal consequences of marriage]]. In 2006, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] rejected a legal bid by a British [[Celia Kitzinger and Sue Wilkinson|lesbian couple]] who had [[Same-sex marriage in British Columbia|married]] in Canada to have their union recognised as a marriage in the UK rather than a civil partnership.

In September 2011, the Coalition Government announced its intention to introduce same-sex civil marriage in England and Wales by the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|May 2015 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Jessica|title=Government proposes introducing gay marriage after Cameron intervention|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/09/16/government-proposes-introduction-of-full-gay-marriage-after-cameron-intervention/|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|date=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike the Scottish Government's consultation, the UK Government's consultation for England and Wales did not include provision for religious ceremonies. In May 2012, three religious groups (Quakers, Liberal Judaism and Unitarians) sent a letter to David Cameron, asking that they be allowed to solemnise same-sex weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/05/29/religious-groups-urge-david-cameron-to-maintain-equal-marriage-support/|title=Religious groups urge David Cameron to maintain equal marriage support|website=PinkNews|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the UK Government completed the consultation to allow civil marriage for same-sex couples in [[England and Wales]].&lt;ref name="grauni1127"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay marriages and heterosexual civil partnerships may soon be welcomed|first=Alan|last=Travis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/17/civil-partnerships-marriage|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its response to the consultation, the Government said that it also intended "...to enable those religious organisations that wish to conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies to do so, on a permissive basis only."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/equal-marriage-consultation|title=Equal marriage consultation|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]], announced that, whilst he favoured allowing same-sex marriage within a religious context, provision would be made guaranteeing no religious institution would be required to perform such ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20642428|title=Gay marriage: David Cameron backs church role|journal=BBC News|accessdate=26 July 2015|date=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third [[Reading (legislature)|reading]] took place on 21 May 2013, and was approved by 366 votes to 161.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay marriage: Commons passes Cameron's plan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22605011|accessdate=21 May 2013|date=21 May 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 July 2013, the Commons accepted all of the Lords' amendments.&lt;ref name=BBC23338279&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23338279|title=Same-sex marriage becomes law in England and Wales|date=17 July 2013|accessdate=5  July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 July 2013, the bill received [[royal assent]] becoming the ''[[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013]]'', which came into force on 13 March 2014.&lt;ref name="BBC23338279"/&gt; The first same-sex marriages took place on 29 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26793127|title=Same-sex marriage now legal as first couples wed|journal=BBC News|accessdate=26 July 2015|date=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Government]] conducted a three-month-long consultation which ended on 9 December 2011. The analysis was published in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Consultation sees 50,000 responses|work=The Scotsman|location=Edinburgh|url=http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/politics/consultation_sees_50_000_responses_1_2001639|accessdate=9 February 2012|date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the consultation held in England and Wales, Scotland considered both civil and religious same-sex marriage. Whilst the Scottish Government was in favour of same-sex marriage, it stated that no religious body would be forced to hold such ceremonies once legislation is enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Parliament Website|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/09/05153328/1|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=9 February 2012|date=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 June 2013, the Government published the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2013/06/same-sex-marriage-27062013|title=Same sex marriage|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015|date=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to preserve the freedom of both religious groups and individual clergy, the Scottish Government believed it necessary for changes to be made to the ''Equality Act 2010'' and communicated with the UK Government on this matter; thus, the first same-sex marriages in Scotland did not occur until this had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-23067324|title=Scotland's gay marriage bill published at Holyrood|journal=BBC News|accessdate=26 July 2015|date=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Celebrating a new America -lovewins 58242 (18588276403).jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[White House]], illuminated in rainbow colors, on the evening of the ''Obergefell'' ruling, June 26, 2015.]]
[[Same-sex marriage in the United States]] expanded from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015 through various state court rulings, state legislation, direct popular votes, and federal court rulings.

Civil rights campaigning in support of marriage without distinction as to sex or sexual orientation began in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=The Same-Sex Couple Who Got a Marriage License in 1971|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/us/the-same-sex-couple-who-got-a-marriage-license-in-1971.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 16, 2015|accessdate=April 6, 2018|last1=Eckholm|first1=Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the now overturned ''[[Baker v.

Miike|Baehr v. Lewin]]'' that it was unconstitutional under the [[Constitution of Hawaii|state constitution]] for the state to abridge marriage on the basis of sex. That ruling led to federal and state actions to explicitly abridge marriage on the basis of sex in order to prevent the marriages of same-sex couples from being recognized by law, the most prominent of which was the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) that attempted to create a federal definition, regardless of state law. In 2003, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] ruled in ''[[Goodridge v. Department of Public Health]]'' that it was unconstitutional under the [[Constitution of Massachusetts|state constitution]] for the state to abridge marriage on the basis of sex. From 2004 through to 2015, as [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States|the tide of public opinion]] continued to move towards support of same-sex marriage, various state court rulings, state legislation, direct popular votes ([[referenda]] and [[initiative]]s), and federal court rulings established same-sex marriage in 36 of the 50 states.

In 2004, [[Coretta Scott King]], a leader of the [[African-American civil rights movement]] and the widow of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], expressed her support for same-sex marriage and publicly denounced attempts to define marriage as the "union of a man and a woman" as a form of "gay bashing".&lt;ref name="Michael Long"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeanne Theoharis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; In 2007, [[Mildred Loving]], the joint plaintiff alongside her husband [[Richard Loving]] in the 1967 landmark civil rights case of ''[[Loving v.

Windsor]]'', leading to federal recognition of same-sex marriage, with federal benefits for married couples connected to either the state of residence or the state in which the marriage was solemnized. In 2015, [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States|national public support for same-sex marriage]] rose to 60% for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Record-High 60% of Americans Support Same-Sex Marriage|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/183272/record-high-americans-support-sex-marriage.aspx|website=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark]] [[civil rights]] case of ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that the [[Fundamental rights in the United States|fundamental right]] of same-sex couples to marry on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples, with all the accompanying rights and responsibilities, is guaranteed by both the [[Due Process Clause]] and the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

The ruling of the Supreme Court in ''Obergefell'' occurred following decades of consistently rising [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States|national public support for same-sex marriage in the United States]], with support continuing to rise thereafter.

The [[United States of America]] is the most populous country in the world to have established same-sex marriage nationwide.

====Uruguay====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Uruguay}}
Uruguay's [[Chamber of Deputies (Uruguay)|Chamber of Deputies]] passed a bill on 12 December 2012, to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diputados aprobó el matrimonio igualitario Pasada la mediano|url=http://www.unoticias.com.uy/2012/12/12/informacion_nacional/diputados_aprobo_el_matrimonio_igualitario/|website=Noticias|publisher=Diario UNoticias|accessdate=31 July 2013|language=Spanish|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Senate (Uruguay)|Senate]] passed the bill on 2 April 2013, but with minor amendments.

===National debates===
====Armenia====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Armenia}}
Armenia has historically had few protections or recognition in law of same-sex couples. This changed in July 2017, when the Ministry of Justice revealed that all marriages performed abroad are valid in Armenia, including marriages between people of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/m/eng/news/243348 |title=Mobile |website=Panarmenian.Net |date=2017-07-03|accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; That made Armenia the second country of the former [[Soviet Union]], after
[[Recognition of same-sex unions in Estonia|Estonia]], to recognise same-sex marriages performed abroad, though it's not clear if such recognition has any practical effect.

====Bulgaria====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Bulgaria}}
The Bulgarian Constitution forbids the legalisation of same-sex marriage, stipulating that marriage can only be between a man and a woman.

In late 2017, a Bulgarian same-sex couple, who [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|married in the United Kingdom]], filed a lawsuit in order to have their marriage recognised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sofiaglobe.com/2017/12/05/woman-sues-bulgarian-authorities-for-recognition-of-same-sex-marriage/ Woman sues Bulgarian authorities for recognition of same-sex marriage] ''The Sofia Globe'', 5 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The Sofia Administrative Court ruled against them in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/186950/The+Court+did+not+Recognize+a+Marriage+Between+Bulgarian+Women+in+the+UK |title=The Court did not Recognize a Marriage Between Bulgarian Women in the UK |publisher=Novinite.com |date=2018-01-12 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sofia]] court granted a same-sex couple the right to live in Bulgaria on 29 June 2018.

====Chile====

[[Michelle Bachelet]], the President of Chile, who was elected to a second term in March 2014, promised to work for the implementation of same-sex marriage and had a majority in both houses of [[National Congress of Chile|Congress]].

On 10 December 2014, a group of [[Senate of Chile|senators]] from various parties, joined LGBT rights group [[MOVILH]] (Homosexual Movement of Integration and Liberation) in presenting a bill to allow same-sex marriage and adoption to Congress. MOVILH had been in talks with the Chilean Government to seek an amiable solution to the pending marriage lawsuit brought against the state before the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cascaraamarga.es/politica-lgtb/lgtb-internacional/10299-el-proyecto-de-ley-de-matrimonio-igualitario-llega-al-parlamento-de-chile.html|title=El proyecto de ley de matrimonio igualitario llega al Parlamento de Chile|publisher=Cáscara Amarga|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 February 2015, lawyers representing the Government and MOVILH met to discuss an amicable solution to the same-sex marriage lawsuit. The Government announced that they would drop their opposition to same-sex marriage. A formal agreement between the two parties and the [[Inter-American Commission of Human Rights]] was signed in April 2015.&lt;ref name="blade"&gt;[http://www.washingtonblade.com/2018/01/15/latin-america-countries-urged-to-abide-by-landmark-lgbt-rights-ruling/ Latin America countries urged to abide by landmark LGBT rights ruling] ''The Washington Blade'', 15 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Chilean Government pledged to legalise same-sex marriage.

On 28 January 2015, the National Congress approved a bill recognizing civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples offering some of the rights of marriage. Bachelet signed the bill on 14 April, and it came into effect on 22 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=Chile recognises same-sex civil unions|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-32296246|journal=BBC News|date=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters-bill-pass&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esposito|first1=Anthony|title=Socially-conservative Chile approves civil unions|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/28/chile-civilunions-idUSL1N0V71X020150128|accessdate=28 January 2015|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruling regarding the legalisation of same-sex marriage in countries that have ratified the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] applies to Chile.

====China====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in China}}
The ''Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China'' explicitly defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman. No other form of civil union is recognized. The attitude of the Chinese Government towards homosexuality is believed to be "three nos": "No approval; no disapproval; no promotion." The Ministry of Health officially removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses in 2001.

[[Li Yinhe]], a sociologist and sexologist well known in the Chinese gay community, has tried to legalize same-sex marriage several times, including during the National People's Congress in 2000 and 2004 (''Legalization for Same-Sex Marriage'' 《中国同性婚姻合法化》 in 2000 and the ''Same-Sex Marriage Bill'' 《中国同性婚姻提案》 in 2004). According to Chinese law, 35 delegates' signatures are needed to make an issue a bill to be discussed in the Congress. Her efforts failed due to lack of support from the delegates. CPPCC National Committee spokesman [[Wu Jianmin]]
when asked about Li Yinhe's proposal, said that same-sex marriage was still too "ahead of its time" for China. He argued that same-sex marriage was not recognized even in many Western countries, which are considered much more liberal in social issues than China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2006-03-05/10278364854s.shtml|title=政协发言人称同性婚姻太超前 李银河提案再受挫_新闻中心_新浪网|publisher=News.sina.com.cn|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement is understood as an implication that the Government may consider recognition of same-sex marriage in the long run, but not in the near future.

On 5 January 2016, a court in [[Changsha]], southern [[Hunan|Hunan Province]], agreed to hear the lawsuit of 26-year-old Sun Wenlin filed in December 2015 against the Bureau of Civil Affairs of Furong District for its June 2015 refusal to let him marry his 36-year-old male partner, Hu Mingliang. On 13 April 2016, with hundreds of same-sex marriage supporters outside, the Changsha court ruled against Sun, who vowed to appeal, citing the importance of his case for LGBT progress in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/13/474065742/chinese-court-rules-against-gay-couple-seeking-to-get-married|title=Chinese Court Rules Against Gay Couple Seeking To Get Married|publisher=The Two-Way|date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a man filed a challenge against Georgia's same-sex marriage ban, arguing that while the Civil Code of Georgia states that marriage is explicitly between a man and a woman; the Constitution does not reference gender in its section on marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/77221|title=Gay Marriage Lawsuit Launched in Georgia|first=Giorgi|last=Lomsadze|date=8 February 2016|publisher=|via=EurasiaNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the Georgian Parliament approved a constitutional amendment establishing marriage as "a union between a woman and a man for the purpose of creating a family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dumbadze |first=Devi |url=https://jamestown.org/program/georgias-ruling-party-supermajority-passes-unilateral-constitutional-reform/ |title=Georgia's Ruling Party 'Supermajority' Passes Unilateral Constitutional Reform |publisher=Jamestown.org |date=2017-09-28 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Giorgi Margvelashvili]] vetoed the constitutional amendment on 9 October.

====India====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in India}}
Same-sex marriage is not explicitly prohibited under Indian law and at least one couple has had their marriage recognised by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.despardes.com/lifestyle/feb05/lesbian-marriages.htm|title=Lesbian marriages in India|publisher=despardes.com|accessdate=11 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203064928/http://www.despardes.com/lifestyle/feb05/lesbian-marriages.htm|archivedate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, [[Medha Patkar]] of the [[Aam Aadmi Party]] stated that her party supports the legalisation of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Morgan |url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/india-party-people-promises-legalize-gay-sex-marriage110414|title=India 'party of the people' promises to legalize gay sex, marriage|publisher=Gay Star News|date=11 April 2014|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, a draft of a [[Uniform Civil Code]] that would legalise same-sex marriage has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.catchnews.com/amp/india-news/a-new-ucc-for-a-new-india-progressive-draft-ucc-allows-for-same-sex-marriages-85386.html|title=A new UCC for a new India?

====Israel====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Israel}}
In 2006, Israel's High Court of Justice ruled to recognize foreign same-sex marriages for the limited purpose of registration with the Administration of Border Crossings, Population and Immigration; however, this is merely for statistical purposes and grants no state-level rights. Israel does not recognize civil marriages performed under its own jurisdiction. A bill was raised in the [[Knesset]] (Israeli Parliament) to rescind the High Court's ruling, but the Knesset did not advance the bill. A bill to legalize same-sex and interfaith civil marriages was defeated in the Knesset, 39–11, on 16 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Jerusalem Post|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=270221|title=Knesset rejects marriage equality bill|date=16 May 2012|author=Harkov, Lahav|accessdate=28 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522013505/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=270221|archivedate=22 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the National LGBT Taskforce of Israel petitioned the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] to allow same-sex marriage in the country, arguing that the refusal of the rabbinical court to recognise same-sex marriage should not prevent civil courts from performing same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.jpost.com/Israel-News/NGO-The-Aguda-petitions-Supreme-Court-to-allow-same-sex-marriage-Israel-431733#article=6017RkIwRTRGQ0UyQzlCNUYxOUM3OUI5QTc1RTJGQkVGMkU=|title=NGO petitions High Court to allow same-sex marriage in Israel|website=The Jerusalem Post|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court handed down a ruling on 31 August 2017, determining the issue was the responsibility of the Knesset, and not the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jpost.com/Israel-News/Supreme-Court-rejects-petition-to-recognize-same-sex-marriage-503894|date=31 August 2017|website=Jerusalem Post|title=Supreme Court rejects petition to recognize same-sex marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion polls have shown that Israelis overwhelmingly support recognizing same-sex unions. A 2017 opinion poll showed that 79% of the Israeli public were in favor of legalizing same-sex unions (either marriage or civil unions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/israeli-support-for-gay-marriage-is-at-an-all-time-high/|title=Israeli support for gay marriage is at an all-time high|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 poll showed that 58% of Israelis were specifically in favor of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/most-israelis-favor-same-sex-marriage-but-half-of-mks-mum-on-issue/ Most Israelis favor same-sex marriage, but half of MKs mum on issue], ''The Times of Israel'', 5 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Japan}}
Same-sex marriage is not legal in Japan. Article 24 of the Japanese Constitution states that "Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of husband and wife as a basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constitution of Japan|date=3 November 1946|location=Tokyo|url=http://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 24 was created to establish the equality of both sexes in marriage, in opposition to the pre-war legal situation whereby the husband/father was legally defined as the head of household and marriage require permission from the male head of the family.

51% of the Japanese population supports same-sex marriage, according to the latest poll carried out in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-29/majority-of-japanese-support-same-sex-marriage-poll-shows|title=Majority of Japanese Support Same-Sex Marriage, Poll Shows|publisher=Bloomberg|date=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Latvia====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Latvia}}
On 27 May 2016, the [[Constitutional Court of Latvia]] overturned an administrative court decision which refused an application to register a same-sex marriage in the country. A Supreme Court press spokeswoman said that the court agrees with the administrative court that current regulations do not allow for same-sex marriages to be legally performed in Latvia. However, the matter should have been considered in a context not of marriage, but of registering familial partnership. Furthermore, it would have been impossible to conclude whether the applicants' rights were violated or not unless their claim is accepted and reviewed in a proper manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsm.lv/en/article/societ/society/supreme-court-rules-same-sex-marriage-request-will-be-considered.a184891/ |title=Supreme Court rules same-sex marriage request will be considered |publisher=Public broadcasting of Latvia |date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court will now decide whether the refusal was in breach of the Latvian Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.

President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] supports the legalization of same-sex marriage, but feels that such a law may not pass in Congress yet as many are still influenced heavily by colonial-era Christian ideals.

====Slovenia====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Slovenia}}
Slovenia recognises registered partnerships for same-sex couples.

In December 2014, the eco-socialist [[United Left (Slovenia)|United Left]] party introduced a bill amending the definition of marriage in the 1976 ''Marriage and Family Relations Act'' to include same-sex couples. In January 2015, the Government expressed no opposition to the bill. In February 2015, the bill was passed with 11 votes to 2. In March, the Assembly passed the final bill in a 51–28 vote. On 10 March 2015, the National Council rejected a motion to require the Assembly to vote on the bill again, in a 14–23 vote. Opponents of the bill launched a petition for a referendum and managed to collect 40,000 signatures. The Parliament then voted to block the referendum with a clarification that it would be against the [[Constitution of Slovenia|Slovenian Constitution]] to vote on matters concerning human rights. Finally, the Constitutional Court ruled against the banning of the referendum (5–4) and [[Slovenian same-sex marriage referendum, 2015|the referendum]] was held on 20 December 2015.

In the referendum, 63.4% of the voters voted against the law, rendering Parliament's same-sex marriage act invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/referendum/pobudniki-referenduma-uspeli-novela-zakona-o-zakonski-zvezi-zavrnjena/381559 |title=Pobudniki referenduma uspeli, sprememba zakona o zakonski zvezi zavrnjena |language=Slovenian|date=20 December 2015 |access-date=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, [[Kim Jho Kwang-soo]] and his partner, Kim Seung-Hwan, filed a lawsuit seeking legal status for their marriage after their marriage registration form was rejected by the local authorities in [[Seoul]]. On 25 May 2016, a South Korean district court ruled against the couple and argued that without clear legislation a same-sex union can not be recognized as a marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/25/south-korea-rejects-film-director-kim-jho-gwang-so-same-sex-marriage-case|title=South Korean court rejects film director's same-sex marriage case|journal=The Guardian|date=25 May 2016|last1=France-Presse|first1=Agence}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple quickly filed an appeal against the district court ruling.

The [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland]] (CVP/PDC) started in 2011 with gathering signatures for a [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)|popular initiative]] entitled "For the couple and the family - No to the penalty of marriage". This initiative would change article 14 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] and aimed to put equal fiscal rights and equal social security benefits between married couples and unmarried cohabiting couples. However, the text aimed to introduce as well in the Constitution for the first time ever the definition of marriage, which would be the sole "union between a man and a woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/vi/vis404t.html|title=Eidgenössische Volksinitiative 'Für Ehe und Familie - gegen die Heiratsstrafe'|website=admin.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June 2015, the Parliament recommended that voters reject the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/federal-gazette/2015/4403.pdf Arrêté fédéral concernant l’initiative populaire «Pour le couple et la famille – Non à la pénalisation du mariage»], Admin.ch; accessed 5 January 2017.{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Council (Switzerland)|Federal Council]] also recommended rejecting the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://queer.ch/politik/schweiz/bundesrat-gegen-cvp-initiative Bundesrat gegen CVP-Initiative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125082428/https://queer.ch/politik/schweiz/bundesrat-gegen-cvp-initiative/ |date=25 November 2015 }}, Queer.ch, 18 November 2015; accessed 5 January 2017.{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen/bundesrat.msg-id-59493.html Bundesrat lanciert Abstimmungskampf zur Volksinitiative gegen die «Heiratsstrafe»], 17 November 2015, admin.ch&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss people voted on the Christian Democrats' proposal in a referendum on 28 February 2016&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/kriminelle-auslaender-gotthard-und-heiratsstrafe-1.18626026 Kriminelle Ausländer, Gotthard und Heiratsstrafe], NZZ.ch, 7 October 2014.{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rejected it by 50.8% of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/february-28-vote_gender-terms-could-sink-bid-for-tax-equality/41984688 Tax break for married couples rejected], Swissinfo.ch, 28 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taiwan====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Taiwan}}
On 22 December 2014, a proposed amendment to the Civil Code which would legalize same-sex marriage was due to go under review by the Judiciary Committee. If the amendment passes the committee stage, it will then be voted on at the plenary session of the [[Legislative Yuan]] in 2015. The amendment, called the marriage equality amendment, would insert neutral terms into the Civil Code replacing ones that imply heterosexual marriage, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage. It would also allow same-sex couples to adopt children.

[[Yu Mei-nu]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP), who is the convener of the current legislative session, has expressed support for the amendment as have more than 20 other DPP lawmakers as well as two from the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] and one each from the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lii Wen|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/12/21/2003607251|title=Gay marriage proposal set for review|website=Taipei Times|date=21 December 2014|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan would become the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage if the Civil Code is amended.

A poll carried out between August and October 2015 found that 71% of the Taiwanese population supported same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/11/30/nearly-two-thirds-of-taiwan-supports-marriage-equality-survey-finds/ |title=Nearly two thirds of Taiwan supports marriage equality, survey finds |publisher=PinkNews |date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tsai Ing-wen]], the President of Taiwan since May 2016, announced her support of same-sex marriage in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/watch-taiwan-presidential-frontrunner-officially-endorses-marriage-equality/|title=Watch: Taiwan presidential frontrunner officially endorses marriage equality|date=2 November 2015|website=gaystarnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, two new same-sex marriage bills were introduced to the [[Legislative Yuan]]. Subsequently, protests have been staged by groups opposing and by groups supporting legalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/12/04/2003660533 |title=Thousands protest gay marriage in Taipei |author=Gerber, Abraham|date=4 December 2016|work=[[Taipei Times]]|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/12/11/2003660976|title=Thousands rally to support equal marriage rights - Taipei Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry, and gave the Taiwanese Government two years to amend the law to that effect. If the law is not amended after two years, same-sex couples will be able to register a valid marriage application in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="NBC News"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/taiwan-court-rules-same-sex-marriage-legal-asia-first-n763931|title=Taiwan Court Rules Same Sex Marriage Legal in Asia First|date=May 24, 2017|work=[[NBC News]]|access-date=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vietnam, currently only a marriage between a man and a woman is recognized.

The 100,000–500,000 [[VND]]  ($24[[USD]]) fine will be abolished. Although same-sex marriages are not permitted in Vietnam, the policy will decriminalize the relationship, habitual privileges such as household registry, property, child raising, and co-habitual partnerships are recognized.&lt;ref&gt;S.

===International organizations===
The terms of employment of the staff of [[international organizations]] (not [[Business|commercial]]) in most cases are not governed by the laws of the country where their offices are located. Agreements with the host country safeguard these organizations' impartiality.

Despite their relative independence, few organizations recognize same-sex partnerships without condition. The agencies of the [[United Nations]] recognize same-sex marriages if the country of citizenship of the employees in question recognizes the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Secretary-General Bulletin|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/522/40/PDF/N0452240.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, these organizations do offer a limited selection of the benefits normally provided to mixed-sex married couples to de facto partners or [[domestic partner]]s of their staff, but even individuals who have entered into a mixed-sex civil union in their home country are not guaranteed full recognition of this union in all organizations. However, the [[World Bank]] does recognize domestic partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTHRJOBS/0,,contentMDK:20522360~menuPK:1353209~pagePK:64262408~piPK:64262191~theSitePK:1058433,00.html|title=Jobs&amp;nbsp;— Compensation &amp; Benefits|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-sexual same-sex marriage===
====Kenya====
{{main|LGBT rights in Kenya}}
Female same-sex marriage is practiced among the [[Gikuyu people|Gikuyu]], [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Kamba people|Kamba]], [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]], and to a lesser extent neighboring peoples.  Approximately 5–10% of women are in such marriages.  However, this is not seen as homosexual, but is instead a way for families without sons to keep their inheritance within the family.&lt;ref&gt;''Gender and Language in Sub-Saharan Africa,'' 2013:35&lt;/ref&gt;  The laws criminalizing homosexuality are generally specific to men, though in 2010 the prime minister called for women to be arrested as well.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

====Nigeria====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Nigeria}}
In Nigeria, homosexual activity between men, but not between women, is illegal.  In 2006, Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] introduced legislation that prohibits same-sex marriages and criminalizes anyone who "performs, witnesses, aids or abets" such ceremonies.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleshman|first=Michael|title=African gays and lesbians combat bias: An 'invisible' minority seeks legal safeguards, acceptance|url=https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol21no1/211-gays-lesbians-combat-bias.html|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=28 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212183121/http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol21no1/211-gays-lesbians-combat-bias.html|archivedate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Igbo people]] and probably other peoples in the south of the country, there are circumstances where a marriage between women is considered appropriate, such as when a woman has no child and her husband dies, and she takes a wife to perpetuate her inheritance and family lineage.&lt;ref name=NigeriaTribune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111010506/http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html|archivedate=11 January 2010|title=Tradition of same gender marriage in Igboland|first=Leo|last=Igwe|website=Nigerian Tribune|date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
{{See also|LGBT rights opposition}}
While few societies have recognized same-sex unions as marriages, the [[history of same-sex unions|historical and anthropological record]] reveals a large range of attitudes towards same-sex unions ranging from praise, through full acceptance and integration, sympathetic toleration, indifference, prohibition and discrimination, to persecution and physical annihilation.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that same-sex marriage, while doing good for the couples that participate in them and the children they are raising,&lt;ref name="Laurie"/&gt; undermines a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-blankenhorn19-2008sep19,0,6057126.story|title=Protecting marriage to protect children|last=Blankenhorn|first=David|date=19 September 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some supporters of same-sex marriages take the view that the government should have no role in regulating personal relationships,&lt;ref name="findlaw1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://family.findlaw.com/marriage/marriage-agreements|title=See discussion of prenuptial and postmarital agreements at Findlaw|publisher=Family.findlaw.com|accessdate=5 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025170627/http://family.findlaw.com/marriage/marriage-agreements/|archivedate=25 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that same-sex marriages would provide social benefits to same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="indegayforum1"&gt;Dale Carpenter is a prominent spokesman for this view.

===Parenting===
{{Main|LGBT parenting|Same-sex marriage and the family}}
Scientific literature indicates that parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union (either a mixed-sex or same-sex union). As a result, professional scientific associations have argued for same-sex marriage to be legally recognized as it will be beneficial to the children of same-sex parents or carers.&lt;ref name="amici"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/10/27/amicus29.pdf|title=Brief of the American Psychological Association, The California Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy as amici curiae in support of plaintiff-appellees&amp;nbsp;– Appeal from United States District Court for the Northern District of California Civil Case No. 09-CV-2292 VRW (Honorable Vaughn R.

====Adoption====
{{main|LGBT adoption}}
All states that allow same-sex marriage also allow the joint [[adoption]] of children by people of the same sex, with the exceptions of Jalisco, Nayarit and Quintana Roo in Mexico. In addition, [[Andorra]], [[Austria]] and [[Israel]] as well as several subnational jurisdictions which do not recognize same-sex marriage nonetheless permit joint adoption by unmarried same-sex couples: Querétaro and Veracruz in Mexico as well as Northern Ireland and Jersey in the United Kingdom. Some additional states allow stepchild adoption by those who are in a same-sex relationship but are unmarried: [[Croatia]], [[Estonia]], [[Italy]] (on a case-by-case basis), [[Slovenia]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://euroclashblog.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/austrian-court-rules-to-allow-same-sex-adoptions/|title=Austrian court rules to allow same-sex adoptions|website=The Privateer|date=16 January 2016|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, more than 16,000 same-sex couples were raising an estimated 22,000 adopted children in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LGBT Adoption Statistics|url=http://www.lifelongadoptions.com/lgbt-adoption/lgbt-adoption-statistics|website=lifelongadoptions.com|access-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4% of all adopted children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Families are created with love|url=http://gayadoption.org/facts-supporting-gay-adoption|website=gayadoption.org|access-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Surrogacy and IVF treatment====
{{main|Assisted reproductive technology}}
A gay or bisexual man has the option of [[surrogacy]], the process in which a woman bears a child for another person through [[artificial insemination]] or carries another woman's surgically implanted [[fertilized egg]] to birth. A lesbian or bisexual woman has the option of artificial insemination.&lt;ref&gt;The Fertility Sourcebook, Third Edition&amp;nbsp;– Page 245, M.

===Transgender and intersex people===
{{synthesis|date=May 2017}}
{{See also|Transgender|Legal aspects of transsexualism|Intersex|Intersex human rights}}
When sex is defined legally, it may be defined by any one of several criteria: the [[XY sex-determination system]], the type of [[gonad]]s, the type of external sexual features, or the person's social identification.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Consequently, both [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] individuals may be legally categorized into confusing gray areas, and could be prohibited from marrying partners of the "opposite" sex or permitted to marry partners of the "same" sex due to legal distinctions.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} This could result in long-term marriages, as well as recent same-sex marriages, being overturned.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The problems of defining gender by the existence/non-existence of gonads or certain sexual features is complicated by the existence of [[Gender Reassignment Surgery|surgical methods]] to alter these features.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Estimates run as high as one percent of live [[childbirth|births]] exhibiting some degree of sexual ambiguity,&lt;ref name="Laurie"&gt;{{citation |last=Laurie|first=Timothy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-03/laurie-bigotry-or-biology/6514156|title=Bigotry or biology: the hard choice for an opponent of marriage equality|publisher=The Drum|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Fausto-Sterling ''et al.'', 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and between 0.1% and 0.2% of live births being ambiguous enough to become the subject of specialist medical attention, including sometimes involuntary surgery to address their sexual ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency|title=How common is intersex?|publisher=Intersex Society of North America|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transgender male or female to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;Bockting, Walter, Autumn Benner, and Eli Coleman. "Gay and Bisexual Identity Development Among Female-to-Male Transsexuals in North America: Emergence of a Transgender Sexuality." ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' 38.5 (October 2009): 688–701. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. 29 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the ''[[Gender Recognition Act 2004]]'' allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the United Kingdom marriages were until recently only for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are only for same-sex couples, a person must dissolve his/her civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate, and the same was formerly true for marriages in England and Wales, and still is in other territories. Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual people to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|title=Austria gets first same-sex marriage|publisher=365gay.com|date=5 July 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017161302/http://365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|archivedate=17 October 2007|accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Quebec, prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried people could apply for legal change of gender. With the advent of same-sex marriage, this restriction was dropped. A similar provision including sterilization also existed in Sweden, but was phased out in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/sweden-ends-forced-sterilization-trans110113|title=Sweden ends forced sterilization of trans|date=11 January 2013|website=gaystarnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, transgender and intersex marriages typically run into similar complications.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} As definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/us/19brfs-USDEFENDSMAR_BRF.html|title=U.S. Defends Marriage Law|work=The New York Times|date=18 September 2009|accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as some of them prohibit legal changes of gender.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Divorce===
{{Main|Divorce of same-sex couples}}
In the United States of America before the case of ''Obergefell v. Hodges'', couples in same-sex marriages could only obtain a divorce in jurisdictions that recognized same-sex marriages, with some exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matthew S. Coleman, Esq.|title=Obergefell v. Hodges|url=http://www.einhornharris.com/familylawblog/obergefell-v-hodges|publisher=Einhorn Harris|accessdate=8 November 2015|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial and legislative===
{{Main|Conflict of marriage laws#Same-sex marriage}}
There are differing positions regarding the manner in which same-sex marriage has been introduced into democratic jurisdictions. A "[[direct democracy|majority rules]]" position holds that same-sex marriage is valid, or void and illegal, based upon whether it has been accepted by a simple majority of voters or of their elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-12-04-gay-poll_N.htm|title=Poll: Calif. gay marriage ban driven by religion|author=Leff, Lisa|agency=Associated Press|date=4 December 2008|work=USA Today|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208080418/http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-12-04-gay-poll_N.htm|archivedate=8 December 2008}} archived here.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a [[civil rights]] view holds that the institution can be validly created through the ruling of an impartial judiciary carefully examining the questioning and finding that the right to marry regardless of the gender of the participants is guaranteed under the civil rights laws of the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7723645.stm|title= Divisions persist over gay marriage ban|author=Mirchandani, Rajesh|publisher=BBC News|date=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Second International''' (1889–1916), the original Socialist International, was an organization of [[workers' movement|socialist and labour parties]] formed in [[Paris]] on 14 July 1889. At the Paris meeting, delegations from twenty countries participated.&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Rubio (1971). ''Las internacionales obreras en América''. Madrid. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The International continued the work of the dissolved [[First International]], though excluding the still-powerful [[anarcho-syndicalist]] movement and [[Trade unions|unions]] and by 1922 April 2 at a major post-World War I conference it began to reorganize into the [[Labor and Socialist International]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Braunthal, History of the International, 1914-1943, Vol 2, p245-247 &lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
Among the Second International's famous actions were its 1889 declaration of 1 May ([[May Day]]) as [[International Workers' Day]] and its 1910 declaration of the [[International Women's Day]], first celebrated on 19 March and then on 8 March after the main day of the women's marches in 1917 during the [[Russian Revolution]]. It initiated the international campaign for the [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour working day]].&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Rubio (1971). ''Las internacionales obreras en América''. Madrid. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International's permanent executive and information body was the [[International Socialist Bureau]] (ISB) based in [[Brussels]] and formed after the International's Paris Congress of 1900. [[Emile Vandervelde]] and [[Camille Huysmans]] of the [[Belgian Labour Party]] were its chair and secretary. [[Vladimir Lenin]] was a member from 1905.

The Second International became ineffective in 1916 during [[World War I]] because the separate national parties that composed the International did not maintain a unified front against the war, instead generally supporting their respective nations' role. The Secretary General of the ISB, Camille Huysmans, moved the ISB from German-occupied Brussels to The Hague in December 1914 and attempted to coordinate socialist parties from the warring states to at least July 1916.&lt;ref&gt;History of the International, 1914-1943, Vol 2, p38, 52&lt;/ref&gt; [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) leader [[Jean Jaurès]]'s assassination, a few days before the beginning of the war, symbolized the failure of the [[antimilitarism|antimilitarist]] doctrine of the Second International. At the [[Zimmerwald Conference]] in 1915, anti-war socialists attempted to maintain international unity against the [[social patriotism]] of the [[Social democracy|social democratic]] leaders.

In July 1920 at Geneva, the last congress of the Second International was held, following its functional collapse during the war. However, some European socialist parties refused to join the reorganized International and decided instead to form the [[International Working Union of Socialist Parties]] (IWUSP) (Second and a half International or Two-and-a-half International), heavily influenced by [[Austromarxism]]. In 1923, IWUSP and the Second International merged to form the social democratic [[Labour and Socialist International]] which continued to exist until 1940. After [[World War II]], a new [[Socialist International]] was formed to continue the policies of the Labour and Socialist International and it continues to this day.

Another successor was the Third International organized in 1919 under the soon-to-be [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. It was officially called the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) and lasted until 1943 when it was dissolved by then Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]].

=== Latin America ===
In [[Latin America]], the International had two affiliates, namely the [[Socialist Party of Argentina]] and the [[Socialist Party of Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubio, José Luis (1971). ''Las internacionales obreras en América''. Madrid. p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The exclusion of anarchists ===
[[Anarchism|Anarchists]] tended to be excluded from the Second International, nevertheless "anarchism had in fact dominated the London Congress of the Second International".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Woodcock]] (1962). ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements''. pp. 263–264.&lt;/ref&gt; This exclusion received the criticism from anti-authoritarian socialists present at the meetings.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Woodcock]] (1962). ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements''. pp. 263–264. "As well as all the anarchist leaders, Keir Hardie and Tom Mann appeared on the platform to make speeches asserting the rights of minorities, and [[William Morris]], now nearing his death, sent a message to say that only sickness prevented him from adding his own voice to the chorus of protest".&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that at some point the Second International turned "into a battleground over the issue of [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] versus [[authoritarian socialism]]. Not only did they effectively present themselves as champions of minority rights, they also provoked the German Marxists into demonstrating a dictatorial intolerance which was a factor in preventing the British labor movement from following the Marxist direction indicated by such leaders as [[Henry Hyndman]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Woodcock]] (1962). ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements''. pp. 263-264.&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War I, there were three Socialist Conferences in Switzerland. These were as a bridge to the creation of the [[Labour and Socialist International]].

'''Shannon LaRhea Marketic''' (born January 14, 1971), is an American actress and beauty pageant titleholder who was [[Miss California USA]] and [[Miss USA]] 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19920210&amp;id=ilkmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e5ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3699,2537062|title=California Student Crowned Miss USA|last=|first=|date=10 February 1992|work=|newspaper=New Straits Times|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, Marketic won the [[Miss California USA]] 1992 title, and went on to represent [[California]] in the [[Miss USA 1992]] pageant, which was broadcast live from [[Wichita, Kansas]] in February of that year. She placed [[Miss USA 1992#Final competition|second]] in semifinal interview, [[Miss USA 1992#Final competition|sixth]] in [[swimsuit]] and [[Evening gown#Black tie occasions|evening gown]], which allowed her to advance as one of the Top 6 finalists of the competition with the [[Miss USA 1992#Final competition|third]] highest semi-finals average score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=19920209&amp;id=1pAzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DOcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5228,3388317|title=New Miss USA displays sense of humour|last=|first=|date=10 February 1992|work=|newspaper=Lawrence Journal|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After answering the judges' questions, she went into the final 3 in [[Miss USA 1992#Final competition|second]] place, eventually winning the Miss Photogenic award and the Miss USA title.

Marketic went on to compete in the 1992 [[Miss Universe 1992|Miss Universe]] pageant held in [[Bangkok, Thailand]] on May 8 and was one of 10 semifinalists who competed for the title. She eventually placed 8th overall.

Its use was common among the successors of the [[Mongol Empire]].

==Etymology==
The origin of the word is not known.

Iron ævzag}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkic languages|Turkic]],&lt;ref name="Turkic1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Róna-Tas, András; "[https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&amp;id=tQi4AAAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Tarkhan Hungarians and Europe in the early Middle Ages]", Central European University Press, p 228, 1999, {{ISBN|9639116483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turkic2"&gt;{{Citation | last = Frye | first = Richard N | title = Tarxun-Turxun and Central Asian History | journal = Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies | volume = 14 | number = 1/2 | pages = 105–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]].

Although [[Richard N. Frye]] reports that the word "was probably foreign to Sogdian", hence considered to be a loanword from Turkic, [[Gerhard Doerfer]] points out that even in Turkic languages, its [[plural]] is not Turkic (sing. ''tarxan'' --&gt; plur. ''tarx'''at'''''), suggesting a non-Turkic origin.&lt;ref name="Doerfer"&gt;{{Citation | first = Gerhard | last = Doerfer | title = Mongolo-Tungusica | editor-first = O | editor-last = Harrassowitz | year = 1985 | publisher = University of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; L. Ligeti comes to the same conclusion, saying that ''"tarxan and tegin [prince] form the wholly un-Turkish plurals tarxat and tegit"'' and that the word was unknown to medieval western Turkic languages, such as [[Bulgar language|Bulgar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = L | last = Ligeti | title = Researches in Altaic languages | editor-first = A | editor-last = Kiadó | year = 1975 | publisher = University of Michigan | page = 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking this into consideration, the word may be derived from medieval Mongolian ''darqat'' (plural suffix ''-at''), itself perhaps derived from the earlier Sogdian word ''*tarxa''n''t'' ("free of taxes").&lt;ref name = "Doerfer" /&gt; A. Alemany gives the additional elaboration that the related East Iranian Scythian (and [[Alans|Alanic]]) word ''*tarxan'' still survives in [[Ossetian language|Ossetic]] ''tærxon'' ("argument, trial") and ''tærxon kænyn'' ("to judge").&lt;ref name="Ossetic" /&gt; [[Harold Walter Bailey]] also proposes an Iranian ([[Saka language|Khotanese Saka]]) root for the word,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bailey | first = Harold W | year = 1985 | url = https://archive.org/details/EtymologyOfXiongnuNamesByTheLateH.w.Bailey | title = Indo-Scythian Studies: being Khotanese Texts | volume = VII | publisher = Cambridge Univ. Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; L. Rogers bears in mind that the word may have originated among the [[Xiongnu]] and [[Huns]] where it was associated with a title for nobility. [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank]] also suggests that both, Turkic ''tarqan'' and Mongolian ''darxan''/''daruyu'', may preserve an original [[Hunnic language|Hunnic]] word.&lt;ref name="Universität Bonn."&gt;Universität Bonn. Seminar für Sprach- und Kulturwissenschaft Zentralasiens: Zentralasiatische Studien, Vol. 24–26, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was borrowed by many languages, including Armenian [[wikt:թարխան|tʿarxan]], Georgian [[wikt:თარხანი|t’arxani]] and Russian [[wikt:тархан|тархан]] through the Mongolian conquests.

==History==
Tarkhan was used among some [[Iranian groups of Turkic descent]] ([[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], [[Saka language|Saka]]), [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalite]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], and [[proto-Mongols|proto-Mongol]] peoples of [[Central Asia]] and by other [[Eurasian nomads]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} It was a high rank in the army of [[Timur]]. Tarkhans commanded military contingents (roughly of regimental size under the Turkic [[Khazars]]) and were, roughly speaking, [[general officer|general]]s. They could also be assigned as military governors of conquered regions.

The [[Göktürks]] probably adopted the title darqan from the proto-Mongol [[Rouran Khaganate|Rourans]] or [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author= Pelliot | title = Neuf Notes | language = French |trans-title=Nine notes | page = 250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tarkhan were cited in the [[Orkhon inscriptions|Orkhon inscription]] of [[Kul Tigin]] (d. c. 731 CE). They were given high honors such as entering the [[yurt]] of the [[khagan]] without any prior appointment and shown unusual ninefold pardon to the ninth generation from any crime they committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Eberhard | title = Conquerors and Rulers | page = 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the etymology of the word is unknown, it is attested under the [[Khitan people]], whose [[Liao dynasty]] ruled most of Mongolia and [[North China]] from 916–1125.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wittfogel  | title = Liao dynasty | page = 433|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many titles, Tarkhan also occurs as a personal name, independent of a person's rank, which makes some historical references confusing.  For example, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] texts refer to a "Tarkhan, king of the Khazars" as reigning in the mid ninth century. Whether this is a confused reference to a military official or the name of an individual Khazar [[khagan]] remains unclear. The name is occasionally used today in Turkish and Arabic speaking countries. It is used as family name in Hungary today.

In the [[Mongol Empire]], the darkhans were exempted from taxation, socage and requisitioning. [[Genghis Khan]] made those who helped his rise darkhans in 1206. The families of the darkhans played crucial roles later when the succession crisis occurred in [[Yuan dynasty]] and [[Ilkhanate]]. [[Abaqa Khan]] (1234–82) made an [[Indian people|Indian]] Darkhan after he had led his mother and her team all the way from Central Asia to Persia safely. A wealthy merchant of Persia was made of Darkhan by [[Ghazan]] (1271–1304) for his service during the early defeat of the Ilkhan. In Russia, the Khans of the [[Golden Horde]] assigned important tasks to the Darkhan. A [[jarlig]] of [[Temür Qutlugh]] (ca. 1370–1399) authorized rights of the tarkhan of Crimea.&lt;ref&gt;http://reff.net.ua/26327-YArlyki_hanov_Zolotoiy_Ordy_kak_istochnik_prava_i_kak_istochnik_po_istorii_prava.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After suppressing the rebellion of the right three tumens in Mongolia, [[Dayan Khan]] exempted his soldiers, who participated the battle of Dalan-Terqin, from imposts and made them Darkhan in 1513. Even after the collapse of [[Northern Yuan dynasty]] with the death of [[Ligdan Khan]] in 1635, the title of darkhan continued to be bestowed on religious dignitaries, sometimes on persons of low birth. For example, in 1665, [[Erinchin Lobsang Tayiji]], the [[Altan Khan of the Khalkha]], bestowed the title on a Russian interpreter and requested the [[Tsar#Russia|Tsar of Russia]] to exempt the interpreter from all tax obligations.&lt;ref name="Genghis Khan p.82" /&gt;

A tarkhan established the [[Tarkhan dynasty]], which ruled [[North India]] from 1554–91.

All craftsmen held the status of darkhan and were immune to occasional requisitions levied incessantly by passing imperial envoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Christopher | last = Atwood | title = Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire | page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, the word referred to craftsmen or [[blacksmith]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Paul | last = Ratchnevsky | title = Genghis Khan: his life and legacy | page = 243}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Mongolian language]] now and is still used in Mongolia as privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Kohn | title = Mongolia | page = 126}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who served the [[Orda (organization)|Khagan's orda]] were granted the title of darkhan and their descendants are known as the ''darkhad'' in [[Ordos City]], [[Inner Mongolia]].

One of the seven [[Magyar tribes|Magyar (Hungarian) tribes]] was called Tarjan (''Ταριάνου'') according to [[Constantine VII|Constantin VII]]'s [[De Administrando Imperio]], and it is a common geographical name used in many villages and city names.

==In fiction==
* In [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series of novels, the apparent spelling variation ''Tarkaan'' is the title of a [[Calormen]] nobleman, ''tarkheena'' that of a noble woman.
* In ''[[Age of Empires II: The Conquerors]]'', the ''tarkan'' is the Huns' unique unit with the appearance of a horseman with a torch and scourge in place of sword. Their strength is destroying buildings.
* Tarkan in the [[Tarkan (comics)|comic Tarkan]] is a fictional Hun warrior created by Turkish cartoonist [[Sezgin Burak]].

'''Tom Carnegie''', born '''Carl Lee Kenagy''', (September 25, 1919{{spaced ndash}}February 11, 2011) was an [[Americans|American]] radio and television broadcaster, [[public address|public-address]] [[announcer]], sports columnist, documentary filmmaker, and educator from [[Norwalk, Connecticut]]. Carnegie's radio and television broadcasting career, which spanned from 1942 to 1985, included work at KITE radio in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[WOWO (AM)]] radio in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]; and [[WXNT|WIRE (AM)]] radio in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. Carnegie was also sports director for [[WRTV]] television in Indianapolis for thirty-two years, and broadcast the [[Indiana High School Boy's Basketball Tournament|Indiana high school boys' basketball tournament]] for twenty-four years.

Carnegie is best known for his deep and resonant voice as the public-address announcer from 1946 to 2006 for the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], which earned him the title of the "Voice of the Speedway." Carnegie's signature calls during the [[Indianapolis 500]]-mile race qualifying attempts were "He's on it" and "It's a new track record," which he repeated many times during his six decades as the Speedway's public address announcer.

==Early life and education==
Born Carl Lee Kenagy on September 25, 1919, in [[Norwalk, Connecticut]],

During his high school years in Missouri, Carl wanted to be an athlete. He excelled in several sports, including football and basketball, but baseball was his favorite. Carl's interest in playing sports shifted to other activities after he contracted a [[polio]]-related virus before his senior year in high school. The illness affected the strength in his legs for the remainder of his life and caused him to begin training his voice for a career in broadcasting. Carl entered extemporaneous speech and debate competitions while still in high school, and won an American Legion oratorical contest during his senior year.&lt;ref name=Price16/&gt;&lt;ref name=WN111-12&gt;{{cite book|authors =Linda Weintraut and Jane Nolan | title ="In the Public Interest": Oral Histories of Hoosier Broadcasters | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1999 | location =Indianapolis | pages =111&amp;ndash;12 | url = | isbn =0-87195-131-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl continued his voice training while attending [[William Jewell College]], a four-year liberal arts college in [[Liberty, Missouri]], ten miles northeast of Kansas City.&lt;ref name=CarnigieIMSdies&gt;{{cite news|title=Tom Carnegie IMS Announcer Dies|url=http://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/tom-carnegie-ims-announcer-dies/|accessdate=4 June 2015|publisher=Motorsport.com|date=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a college student he majored in theater, was on the school's debate team, and worked part-time at KITE radio station in Kansas City, his first radio job. Carl also did public-address announcements at the college's ball games. He graduated from college in 1942.&lt;ref name=Price16/&gt;&lt;ref name=WN111-12/&gt;

==Early career==

After graduating from college in 1942, Carl took a  job at [[WOWO (AM)]] radio in [[Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]]. That same year, Eldon Campbell, the station's program manager, persuaded Carl to change his on-air name to Tom Carnegie because he thought it sounded better. Carnegie continued to use the on-air name for the remainder of his broadcasting career, but he never changed it to his legal name.&lt;ref name=Price16/&gt;&lt;ref name=WN111&gt;Weintraut and Nolan, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WTHR&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | vauthors = | title =Speedway Announcer Tom Carnegie Dies at 91 | work = | publisher =WTHR.com  | date =2011-02-11 |url=http://www.wthr.com/story/14012762/speedway-announcer-carnegie-dies-at-91 | format = | accessdate =2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Fort Wayne station Carnegie worked as a staff announcer, covered sporting events, including broadcasts of [[Fort Wayne Pistons]] games, and did a few comedy programs before taking a job in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Weintraut and Nolan, p. 111 and 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945 Carnegie moved to Indianapolis, where he became sports director at [[WXNT|WIRE (AM)]] radio. The station was owned by [[Eugene S. Pulliam]], who also owned the ''[[The Indianapolis Star|Indianapolis Star]]''. In addition to his radio broadcasts, Carnegie wrote a sports column for Pulliam's newspaper.&lt;ref name=WN111/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price18&gt;Price, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television broadcaster==
In 1953 Carnegie became sports director for WFBM-TV, later known as [[WRTV]] (Channel 6), in Indianapolis. He remained at the station for thirty-two years, retiring in 1985.&lt;ref name=WN111/&gt; Carnegie is best known for initiating WRTV's broadcasts of daily trackside reports of the [[Indianapolis 500]]-mile race during the month of May.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | vauthors = | title ='Voice Of The Speedway' Tom Carnegie Dies| work = | publisher =WRTV Channel 6: The Indy Channel  | date =2011-02-11 | url =http://www.theindychannel.com/sports/26808889/detail.html | accessdate =2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; WRTV also aired one-hour broadcasts with Carnegie as the program's announcer on each of the four qualifying days in May.&lt;ref name=WN119&gt;Weintraut and Nolan, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his work at the Speedway, Carnegie's other assignments for the Indianapolis television station included covering the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], and the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]. In the late 1960s he also covered the first [[United States Auto Club|U.S. Auto Club]]-sanctioned race outside the United States.&lt;ref name=Price16/&gt; Carnegie retired from WRTC in 1985, but continued his work at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] until 2006.&lt;ref name= death/&gt;

==Indianapolis Motor Speedway announcer==
[[File:TomCarnegie1985.JPG|thumb|Carnegie at the 1985 Indianapolis 500]]
Carnegie was the [[public address|public-address]] [[announcer]] for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway from 1946 until his retirement in 2006.&lt;ref name=retirement/&gt; Carnegie's six decades of service in that capacity earned him the title the "Voice of the Speedway."&lt;ref name=WN111/&gt; Carnegie called sixty-one Indianapolis 500-mile races and six Grand Prix races during his tenure at the Speedway.&lt;ref name=WTHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price15&gt;Price, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie got his start at the Speedway in 1946. Three-time Indianapolis 500 winner [[Wilbur Shaw]], who was involved in helping revive the auto race on [[Memorial Day]] weekend, first heard Carnegie's voice in 1945, when Carnegie was announcing an antique car show in Indianapolis. Shaw urged [[Tony Hulman]], the new Speedway owner, to hire Carnegie as the lead public-address announcer for the 500-mile auto race in May 1946, the first one held after its temporary suspension during World War II.&lt;ref name=retirement/&gt;

At that time Carnegie, who knew nothing about auto racing, had no advance reparation for the event. All he had was a list of drivers and the numbers of their racecars. As with all the other spectators, Carnegie could not see the entire {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} of the oval track.&lt;ref name=Price15/&gt; He later remarked: "I had never seen such a crowd, let alone a 500-Mile Race" and "it took me ten to fifteen years to have any confidence that what I was saying was right."&lt;ref name=Price18&gt;Price, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie remained the Speedway's announcer for six decades.&lt;ref name=death/&gt; His signature phrases were "H's onnnnn it" as a driver would come down the Speedway's front stretch to take the green flag, which signaled the start of the driver's qualifying four-lap run, and reported especially fast laps in qualifying efforts with "Listen to this one, fans, you won't believe this!" followed by his favorite line, "It's a neeeeeww track record!"&lt;ref name=Price15/&gt; National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing driver [[Tony Stewart]] once remarked: "You take him and put him on a microphone at a race track and if you know anything about racing, you know who that is on the other end of the microphone."&lt;ref name=death/&gt; Later in life Carnegie acknowledged, "I'm on the P.A. to inform,"&lt;ref name=WN120&gt;Weintraut and Nolan, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; but he also wanted to create excitement for the fans, and considered his broadcasts as "speed theater."&lt;ref name=Price18/&gt;

During his years as the Speedway's announcer, Carnegie witnessed and reported many changes, including the introduction of new technology and real-time, electronic updates of race events that eventually decreased the fans' reliance on Carnegie's announcements.&lt;ref name=Price15/&gt; He was also on hand to witness many Speedway firsts including the debut in 1977 of [[Janet Guthrie]], the first woman driver at the Indianapolis 500-mile race, and the introduction of [[NASCAR]] events at the Speedway with the debut of the [[Brickyard 400]] in 1994, among others.&lt;ref name=Price19&gt;Price, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The last time race fans heard Carnegie say "It's a new track record!" during qualifications was for driver [[Arie Luyendyk]] in May 1996. Carnegie retired from his work at the Speedway in 2006.&lt;ref name=WTHR/&gt;

==Basketball tournament announcer==
Although Carnegie is renowned for his work as the Speedway's announcer, he is also famous in Indiana for his announcing the Indiana high school boys' basketball tournament, which he began broadcasting on television in 1953.&lt;ref name=WN111/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price15/&gt; Carnegie later commented about his first experience with [[Hoosier Hysteria]]: "I had no idea what I was getting into. I'd never seen anything like it."&lt;ref name=Price17&gt;Price, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He broadcast the state high school boys' basketball championships for twenty-four years.&lt;ref name=retirement/&gt; During that time Carnegie paired with Howdie Bell, and for more than twenty years with [[Butler University]] coach [[Tony Hinkle|Paul D. "Tony" Hinkle]] for broadcasts of the tournament.&lt;ref name=Price19/&gt;&lt;ref name=WN112&gt;Weintraut and Nolan, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie's later acknowledged his all-time favorite sporting event broadcasts were the 1954, 1955, and 1956 Indiana high school boys' basketball tournaments.&lt;ref name=Price19/&gt; Carnegie was the game announcer for the 1954 tournament at [[Hinkle Fieldhouse]] on the Butler University campus, where the [[Milan High School (Indiana)|Milan High School]] team upset [[Muncie Central High School]] to win the state championship. The game and [[Bobby Plump]]'s buzzer-beating shot were the inspiration for the film ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]'' (1986).&lt;ref name=WTHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=death/&gt; Carnegie was also the announcer for [[Crispus Attucks High School]]'s back-to-back wins in 1955 and 1956.&lt;ref name=Price19/&gt;

==Educator==
In addition to broadcasting, Carnegie was a part-time instructor at Butler University. He began teaching in 1949, chaired the school's radio department, and directed its radio station, [[WJJK|WAJC]], until his departure in 1953 to become sports director for WFBM television in Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=WN111/&gt; Howdy Bell, Carnegie's former student and later his television partner for broadcasts of Indiana's high school boys' basketball tournament, explained that Carnegie "knew exactly how to build excitement among the spectators and the TV audience."&lt;ref name=Price16/&gt;

==Filmmaker and author==
In 1965, following [[Jim Clark]]'s win at the Indianapolis 500-mile race, Carnegie and a crew traveled to [[Scotland]] to film a documentary called ''The Flying Scot'', which Carnegie produced and narrated. The documentary was the "first driver-feature shown on national television in the United States"&lt;ref name=death/&gt; (on [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]]); it also aired on the [[BBC]] in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name=Price16/&gt;

Carnegie made a brief appearance in the film ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]'' (1986), where he portrayed the announcer for the film's climactic championship game. The scenes were shot on location at Hinkle Fieldhouse on Butler campus in Indianapolis, where Carnegie announced Milan High School's upset of Muncie Central in the 1954 state championship game.&lt;ref name=death/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price15/&gt;

Carnegie appears as himself in three [[ESPN]] ''[[SportsCentury]]'' television documentaries: "A. J. Foyt," (2001) "Rick Mears," (2001) and "Al Unser Sr." (2002).&lt;ref name=IMDb&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | vauthors = | title =Tom Carnegie | work = | publisher =IMDb.com | date = | url =https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0138656/| format = | accessdate =2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community service==
Carnegie helped establish the [[Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame]] in [[New Castle, Indiana]]; it is the only statewide basketball hall of fame in the United States with a permanent facility. He also assisted in launching New Castle's annual Hall of Fame Classic basketball game.&lt;ref name=Price15/&gt;

==Later years==
In his later years Carnegie acknowledged his favorite Indianapolis 500 drivers were Jim Clark, the subject of Carnegie's documentary film in 1965, and [[Eddie Sachs]], who was killed in a crash during the Indianapolis 500-mile race in 1964. Carnegie also recalled that the 1973 race was the "most emotionally shattering" for him.&lt;ref name=Price21&gt;Price, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; That May the race was held over three days due to bad weather and two drivers were killed: [[Art Pollard]] (during practice) and [[Swede Savage]] (from injuries during the race). By 2007 Carnegie had spoken at the memorial services of twenty-four racecar drivers.&lt;ref name=Price21/&gt;

===Death and legacy===
As Carnegie grew older, mobility in his legs became more difficult.&lt;ref name=retirement/&gt; He died on February 11, 2011 at age 91.&lt;ref name=death/&gt; A memorial event was held at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum]] following his death.&lt;ref name=Price21/&gt;

Carnegie was known for his deep, rich, and "almost thundering voice."&lt;ref name=Price15/&gt; He was also known for his wit and rapport with the sports personalities he interviewed.&lt;ref name=Price19/&gt; As former Indianapolis 500-mile auto racer [[Johnny Rutherford]] described Carnegie's broadcasts: "The delivery, the way Tom said them, his timing on everything was impeccable."&lt;ref name=retirement/&gt; For many, Carnegie's presences at the Speedway was a sixty-year tradition. Indianapolis Motor Speedway historian [[Donald Davidson (historian)|Donald Davidson]] suggested that "no single individual had more to do with the growth of qualifications during the month of May" than Carnegie.&lt;ref name=Price15/&gt; [[Mari Hulman George]], Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corporation's chairman of the board at the time of Carnegie's death, also commented: "Millions of race fans who never met Tom still felt as if they knew him because of his distinctive voice and his passion for the Speedway, its events and its people."&lt;ref name=WTHR/&gt;

==Personal life==
Carl and his wife Dorothy Jean (D. J.) had three children: two sons, Robert and Blair; and a daughter, Charlotte.&lt;ref&gt;Price, p. 16 and 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect|Torres language|the language spoken on the Torres Islands of Vanuatu|Lo-Toga language}}

There are three languages spoken in the [[Torres Strait Islands]], two indigenous languages and an English-based creole.  The indigenous language spoken mainly in the western and central islands is [[Kalaw Lagaw Ya]]: a language related to the [[Pama–Nyungan languages]] of the Australian mainland. The other indigenous language spoken mainly in the eastern islands is [[Meriam language|Meriam Mir]]: a member of the [[Trans-Fly languages]] spoken on the nearby south coast of New Guinea and the only [[Papuan languages|Papuan language]] native to Australia. Both languages are [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]], however Kalaw Lagaw Ya appears to be undergoing a transition into a [[declension]]al language while Meriam Mìr is more clearly agglutinative. [[Torres Strait Creole|Yumplatok]], the third language, is a non-typical Pacific English Creole and is the main language of communication on the islands.

== Kalaw Lagaw Ya ==

The language of the western and central islands of Torres Strait is related to languages of the Australian mainland and is a member of the [[Pama–Nyungan languages|Pama–Nyungan]] family of languages, which covers most of Australia. This language is known by its dialect names : Kalau Lagau Ya, Kalau Kawau Ya, Kulkalgau Ya and Kaiwaligau Ya (this latter also called Kowrareg, which is from the mid-19th century Kowrareg dialect form ''kauraraiga/kaurarega'' 'islander'. [[Kalau Lagau Ya]] is often called Kala Lagaw Ya in the literature. From here on it is known as Kalau Lagau Ya as per the High Court Decision on 7 August 2013.

Volume 3, "Linguistics", 1907, by Sydney H. Ray, of the 6 volume ''Reports of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits'' and  "Ngalmun Lagaw Yangukudu: The Language of our Homeland in Goemulgaw Lagal: Cultural and Natural Histories of the Island of Mabuyag, Torres Strait", 2015, by Rod Mitchell, of the Memoirs of the Queensland Museum: Culture, 8 (1): 323–446, April 2015, ISSN 1440-4788, are the main descriptions of the language. Ray contains a vocabulary list of both Mabuiag (as called by the Cambridge Expedition) and Meriam Mìr. In 2001 and 2003, Ron Edwards published the Torres Strait Languages vocabularies of Sydney H. Ray.  This is the only dictionary available for use by Torres Strait Islanders and people who want to teach, learn and speak the Torres Strait languages. Unfortunately, neither the Ray work nor his vocabularies are very good, and contain many mistakes. The dictionaries can only be used in conjunction with knowledgeable native speakers to point out errors and corrections.

The four dialects of the Kalau Lagau Ya are very close to each other, somewhat like Standard American and Standard Australian English are to each other.  Its vocabulary is potentially 80% non-Australian; much of the non-Australian content is Papuan (Trans-Fly) and Austronesian (South-East Papuan – see for example Bruno David, Ian McNiven, Rod Mitchell, Meredith Orr, Simon Haberle, Liam Brady and Joe Crouch, "Badu 15 and the Papuan–Austronesian Settlement of Torres Strait". In Archaeology in Oceania; 1 July 2004, and "Ngalmun Lagaw Yangukudu: The Language of our Homeland in Goemulgaw Lagal: Cultural and Natural Histories of the Island of Mabuyag, Torres Strait").  It is an interesting language in having feminine and masculine gender, though no neuter gender [this is typical among Australian languages that have gender as well as many of the neighbouring Papuan languages] – and the difference is semantically significant in that many words can be masculine or feminine according to basic reference or culturally significant reference.  For example, '''za''' as masculine means 'an important topic/subject', and as feminine is 'thing, object'. ''Gœiga'' when masculine means 'sun', and when feminine means 'day'.

== Meriam Mir ==

The language of eastern Torres Strait is [[Meriam language|Meriam Mìr]]. This is a [[Papuan language]] and is related to the languages of the nearby coast of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Meriam Mir is the only Papuan language indigenous to Australia, and used to have two dialects, Erubim Mìr and Meriam Mir.

Both languages are strictly speaking mixed languages, Meriam Mìr having some Australian/Kalaw Lagaw Ya influence as well as Austronesian.  It is probably the case that Meriam Mìr settlers 'overlaid' Kalaw lagaw ya speakers on the Eastern islands (these non-Meriam people who have always been resident on the Eastern Islands are called ''Nog Le'' 'Common People', Lawrie).{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

== Torres Strait Creole ==

The third language of the Torres Straits is a [[creole language|creole]] that developed from Torres Strait Pidgin English, the earliest records of which date to the mid 1800s, though creolisation started in the 1880s at the earliest. This [[Torres Strait Creole]] is also known as ''Blaikman Tok'', ''Broken/Brokan'' and ''Yumplatok''.  It has five dialects – Papuan, Western-Central, Eastern, TI and Cape York.

== Sign language==
{{main|Western Torres Strait Islander Sign Language|Eastern Torres Strait Islander Sign Language}}
Both languages have [[manually coded language|signed forms]], though they are not reported to be particularly well-developed compared to other [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Kendon|Kendon, A.]] (1988) ''Sign Languages of Aboriginal Australia: Cultural, Semiotic and Communicative Perspectives.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

The table below shows how some example phrases differ in the Torres Strait languages. Kalau Kawau Ya,  Kala Lagau Ya, Kulkalgau Ya and Kaiwaligau Ya, 'old' Kaiwaligau Ya are the dialects of Kalau Lagau Ya.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2335">The '''Tsamai people''' (also spelled '''Tsemay''', '''Tsamay''', '''Tsemai''', '''Tsamako''', or '''Tsamakko''') are an ethnic group of southwestern [[Ethiopia]]. They speak a [[Cushitic language]] called [[Tsamai language|Tsamai]], which is one of the [[Dullay languages]], and thus related to the [[Bussa language|Bussa]] and [[Gawwada language]]s.

According to the 1998 Ethiopian census, the Tsamai number 9,702. The number of speakers of the Tsamai language is 8,621, with 5,298 monolinguals.&lt;ref name="Ethno"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=tsb|title=Tsamai|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Tsamai use the [[Konso language]] for trade purposes.&lt;ref name=Ethno/&gt;

Most Tsamai live in the [[Bena Tsemay]] [[woreda]] of the [[Debub Omo Zone]] of the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region]], in the Lower [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo River]] Valley and just to the west of the [[Konso special woreda]]. Many Tsamai live in the town of [[Weyto, Ethiopia|Weyto]], which is approximately 50 km from the town of [[Jinka]], on the [[Konso]]-Jinka road.

Most Tsamai are agro-pastoralists, herding cattle as well as growing crops. Many Tsamai women wear clothing made from leather. Many Tsamai men carry small stools around with them, which they use in case they need to sit down.

They have a very low level of literacy: below 1% in their first language and 2.8% in their second language.&lt;ref name=Ethno/&gt;

The Tsamai live in an area that is frequented by [[Adventure travel|adventure tours]], and thus are a frequently photographed people.

'''United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS)''' is a student organization founded in 1998 with chapters at over 250 colleges and universities in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. In April 2000, USAS founded the [[Worker Rights Consortium]] (WRC), an independent monitoring organization that investigates labor conditions in factories that produce collegiate apparel all over the world. The WRC exacts an annual membership fee from participating universities, which is used to fund its monitoring work.

The WRC works with [[NGO]]s, [[human rights]] groups, and local labor unions or federations, in countries where collegiate apparel is produced. At present over 180 universities and colleges have affiliated with the WRC. USAS is also proposing that universities sign on to the [[Designated Suppliers Program]], or DSP, which would act to source collegiate apparel from factories that respect workers' rights to form unions and be paid living wages.

In 2000, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and other major clothing corporations renamed the Apparel Industry Partnership (AIP) the [[Fair Labor Association]] (FLA), in large part to compete with the WRC. The AIP, an initiative of the Clinton Administration, had become a discredited organization, because all non-profit organizations and unions that had initially supported it, withdrew from it, with the exception of the International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF), who subsequently withdrew their institutional membership on the FLA Board soon afterwards.

United Students Against Sweatshops is widely viewed as the largest [[anti-sweatshop]] community group in the United States and Canada. It was formed in 1997 as part of a broader [[anti-sweatshop movement]] increasingly popular in [[North America]].  This movement exhibited a great degree of skepticism of [[free trade]] practices, such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) or the proposed [[Free Trade Agreement of the Americas]] (FTAA).

Focusing on domestic as well as international [[sweatshops]], the group has built coalitions of students, labor groups, workers, and community members that focus on a range of campaigns:

*requesting that [[Russell Brands]] Athletic Brand significantly alter its labor policies in Central America&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.lib.washington.edu/findingaids/view?docId=BrandResponsiblityProject5683.xml Brand Responsibility Project Records] 2004-2012.0.84 cubic feet (2 boxes) of textual materials plus 83.8 GB of digital files.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*supporting an anti-sweatshop policy called the [[Designated Suppliers Program]], which would source collegiate apparel from factories that respect workers' rights to form unions and be paid living wages
*supporting the [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]]' campaign against [[Taco Bell]] to win higher wages for farm laborers ("Boot the Bell")
*protesting sweatshop working conditions at [[New Balance]] in New York and [[Forever 21]] in San Francisco

The '''Volga Germans''' ({{lang-de|Wolgadeutsche}} or ''{{lang|de|Russlanddeutsche}}'', {{lang-rus|Поволжские немцы|Povolzhskiye nemtsy}}) are [[ethnic German]]s who colonized and historically lived along the [[Volga River]] in the region of southeastern [[European Russia]] around [[Saratov]] and to the south. Recruited as immigrants to Russia in the 18th century, they were allowed to maintain their German culture, language, traditions, and churches (Lutheran, Reformed, Catholics, [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], and [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonites]]).  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many Volga Germans emigrated to [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[the Dakotas]], [[California]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and other states across the western United States, as well as to [[Canada]] and [[South America]] (mainly [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]]).

After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941 during World War II, the Soviet government considered the Volga Germans potential collaborators, and transported many of them eastwards, where thousands died. After the war, the Soviet Union expelled a moderate number of ethnic Germans to the West. In the late 1980s and 1990s, many of the remaining ethnic Germans moved from the Soviet Union to Germany.

==Catherine the Great==
[[Image:Katharina-II-von-Russland.jpg|thumb|[[Catherine the Great|Catherine II "The Great"]]]]
In 1762, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], born a [[Germans|German]] princess and a native of [[Szczecin|Stettin]], Pomerania, deposed her husband [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]], born a [[Germans|German]] prince in [[Kiel]], and took the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] imperial throne. Catherine the Great published manifestos in 1762 and 1763 inviting Europeans (except [[Jews]])&lt;ref name=Lewis1999_p61&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]], ''Semites and Anti-Semites'', New York, [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], 1999 edition, {{ISBN|0-393-31839-7}}, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; to immigrate and become Russian citizens and farm Russian lands while maintaining their language and culture. Although the first received little response, the second improved the benefits offered and was more successful in attracting colonists. People in other countries such as [[France]] and [[England]] were more inclined to migrate to the colonies in the Americas than to the Russian frontier. Other countries, such as [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], forbade emigration. The settlers came mainly from [[Bavaria]], [[Baden]], [[Hesse]], the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], and the [[Rhineland]], over the years 1763 to 1767. They indeed helped modernize the backward agricultural sector by introducing numerous innovations regarding wheat production and flour milling, tobacco culture, sheep raising, and small-scale manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;"The Economic Contributions of the German Russians to the Imperial Russian Economy." ''Journal of the American Historical Society of Germans from Russia'' (2012) 35#2 pp 1-34&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Fred C. Koch, ''The Volga Germans: in Russia and the Americas, from 1763 to the present'' (Penn State Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the Volga Germans helped to populate Russia's South adding a buffer against possible incursions by the Ottoman Empire. 

The early German settlements were attacked during the [[Pugachev's Rebellion|Pugachev uprising]] from 1773 through 1775, which was centred on the Volga area, but they survived the rebellion. According to Darrel P. Kaiser, "[[Kazakhs|Kazakh]]-Kirghiz tribesmen kidnapped 1573 settlers from colonies in 1774 alone and only half were successfully ransomed. The rest were killed or enslaved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Darrel P. Kaiser|title=Origin &amp; Ancestors Families Karle &amp; Kaiser Of the German-Russian Volga Colonies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=He-n20u0pW0C|accessdate=May 31, 2012|year=2006|publisher=Darrel P. Kaiser|isbn=978-1-4116-9894-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite rough relations between the local Russians and German immigrants, several Germans married into local Russian families. Most Russo-German marriages occurred in families that left their respective villages, and despite mixing with the Slavs, their patriarchal nature would help preserve German language and culture.{{citation needed|date=June 2018|reason=Initially said reason was because Germans were "patronymic", changed to patriarchal, but still should be confirmed.}}

Those who went to Russia had special rights under the terms of the manifesto. Some, such as being exempt from military service, were revoked in the latter part of the 19th century when the government needed more conscripts for the Russian army. The German [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonite]] communities were opposed to military service because of their pacifist beliefs, so many Mennonites emigrated to the Americas instead.

==20th century==
[[File:Volga German03.png|thumb|left|Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, 1924-1941]]
Following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the [[Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (''Autonome Sozialistische Sowjet-Republik der Wolga-Deutschen'' in German; АССР Немцев Поволжья in Russian) was established in 1924, and it lasted until 1941. Its capital was [[Engels, Saratov Oblast|Engels]], known as ''Pokrovsk'' (''Kosakenstadt'' in German) before 1931.

Of all the ethnic German communities in the Soviet Union, the Volga Germans represented the single largest group expelled from their historical homeland. Shortly after the German invasion, on June 22, 1941, Stalin sent [[Lavrentiy Beria|Beria]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]] to the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic to determine a course of action for its German inhabitants. On return, they recommended the deportation of the entire German population. Consequently, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued a resolution on August 12, calling for the expulsion of the entire German population. With this authority, Beria on August 27 issued an order entitled "On Measures for Conducting the Operation of Resettling the Germans from the Volga German Republic, Saratov, and Stalingrad Oblasts," assigning the deputy head of the NKVD, (secret police) Ivan Serov, to command this operation. He also allocated NKVD and Red Army troops to carry out the transfer. The Germans were to be sent to various oblasts (provinces) in Siberia and Kazakhstan, beginning on September 3, and ending on September 20, 1941. On September 7, 1941, the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was officially abolished, clearly showing that the Soviets considered the expulsion of the Germans final.

On August 28, 1941, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR approved and published a decree, which was the only official decree ever published by the Soviet Union concerning the deportation and exile of the German Russian community. The Soviet regime stated that the evacuation was a preventive measure—so that the German population would not be misled into collaborating with the German Army—rather than a punitive measure. Stalin allegedly gave the following "secret" order to the NKVD, produced in [[German occupation of Latvia during World War II|Nazi controlled Latvia]] on September 20, 1941:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
        	 "After the house search, tell everyone who is scheduled to be deported that, according to the government’s decision, they are being sent to other regions of the USSR. Transport the entire family in one car until the train station, but at the station, heads of families [read: men] must be loaded into a separate train car prepared especially for them....Their families are deported for special settlements in the far away regions of the Union. [Family members] must not know about the forthcoming separation from the head of the family."&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Merten, Voices from the Gulag: The Oppression of the German Minority in the Soviet Union, American Historical Society of Germans from Russia, Lincoln, Nebraska, 2015, page 167,{{ISBN|978-0-692-60337-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This above document may be a fabrication, as Latvia was under German occupation at that time. Nevertheless, the instructions were followed by the NKVD troops who directed the deportation.&lt;ref name="Merten 2015 p 168"&gt;Merten 2015 p 168&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for separating the men is that they were all destined for the forced labor camps, ''Trudarmii'' (labor army). The German exiles coined this phrase, whereas Soviet documents only referred to "labor obligations" or "labor regulations." Men between the ages of 15 and 55 and, later, women between the ages of 16 and 45 were forced to do labor in the forests and mines of Siberia and Central Asia under conditions similar to that prevalent in the Gulag slave labor camps.&lt;ref name="Merten 2015 p 168"/&gt;
The expulsion of the Volga Germans finished on schedule at the end of September 1941. The number sent to [[Siberia]] and Kazakhstan totaled approximately 438,000. Together with 27,000 expelled in the same [[ethnic cleansing]] action from the Stalingrad Oblast and 47,000 from the [[Saratov Oblast]], the total number sent to forced internal exile was about 512,000. It should be noted that the source of these figures is from the Soviet Union. It took 151 train convoys to accomplish the transfer of the Volga German population, an astounding figure when one considers that the Soviet Union was heavily engaged fighting the advancing German army, and all railway stock was required to bring soldiers to the front. This operation also involved 1,550 NKVD and 3,250 police agents assisted by 12,150 soldiers of the Red Army.&lt;ref&gt;Merten, 2015 p 170)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 after the Nazi invasion, the [[NKVD]] (via [[decree|Prikaz]] №35105) banned ethnic Germans from serving in the Soviet military.  They sent tens of thousands of these soldiers to the ''Trudarmii''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Otto Pohl, ''Ethnic cleansing in the USSR, 1937-1949,'' Greenwood Publishing Group, via books.google.com, accessed 12 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, nearly all the able-bodied German population was conscripted to the [[NKVD labor columns]]. About one-third did not survive the camps.&lt;ref name="conquest59"&gt;Robert Conquest, ''The Nation Killers'' (Macmillan, 1970), pages 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent years==
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-000471, Russland, Dorf Streckerau an der Wolga.jpg|thumb|Streckerau, 1920, nowadays Novokamenka, Rovnoye (Rovensky) district, [[Saratov Oblast]]]]

The Volga Germans never returned to the Volga region in their old numbers. They were not allowed to settle in the area for decades.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}. After the war, many remained in the [[Ural Mountains]], [[Siberia]], [[Kazakhstan]] (1.4% of today's Kazakh population are recognized as Germans - around 200,000), [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] (about 16,000 = 0.064%).&lt;ref name="Stat.kz"/&gt; After the initial period of persecution, they recovered in their new locations, where their numbers increased, and they continued to preserve their distinct cultural identity. Decades after the war, some talked about resettling where the German Autonomous Republic used to be.  They met opposition from the population that had been resettled in the territory and did not persevere. 
[[File:Volga German area.gif|thumb|left|Volga German cities and settlements]]

A proposal in June 1979 called for a new German Autonomous Republic within Kazakhstan, with a capital in [[Ermentau]]. The proposal was aimed at addressing the living conditions of the displaced Volga Germans. At the time, around 936,000 ethnic Germans were living in Kazakhstan, as the republic's third-largest ethnic group. On June 16, 1979, demonstrators in Tselinograd ([[Astana]]) protested this proposal. Fearing a negative reaction among the majority [[Kazakhs]] and calls for autonomy among local [[Uyghurs]], the ruling Communist Party scrapped the proposal for ethnic German autonomy within Kazakhstan.

Since the late 1980s and the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], some ethnic Germans have returned in small numbers to [[Engels (city)|Engels]], but many more emigrated permanently to Germany.  They took advantage of the German [[Right of return#Germany|law of return]], a [[German nationality law|policy which grants citizenship]] to all those who can prove to be a refugee or expellee of German ethnic origin or as the spouse or descendant of such a person. ([[Greece]] had a similar law for the ethnic Greek minority from the former Soviet Union).

Since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 and the independence of the Baltic states, some Russian ethnic Germans began to return to the area of the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] (formerly part of [[East Prussia]]), especially Volga Germans from other parts of Russia and Kazakhstan, as well as to the Volga Germans' old territory in southern Russia near [[Volgograd]].  This tempo increased after Germany stopped granting the free right of return to ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union. As of the 2002 Russian census, 8,340 Germans (or 0.87% of the  population) were listed in the Kaliningrad Oblast, dropping to 7,349 in 2010 due to deaths. [[Volgograd Oblast]] counted 10,102 Germans in the 2010 Census. However, almost none of the pre-World War II German population remains in the Kaliningrad Oblast, with the vast majority of the current population recent Russian-speaking migrants. Due to the new restrictions by the German government, the flow of ethnic Germans to Germany has greatly slowed if not ceased, while the remaining Germans in Central Asia continue to emigrate, but to Russia instead of Germany.

==North America==
[[File:Volga-Germans-US.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Temporary quarters for Volga Germans in central Kansas, 1875]]
{{Main article|Germans from Russia}}
Germans from Russia were the most traditional of German-speaking arrivals to [[North America]]. Although they had been promised a degree of relative autonomy (including being exempt from [[conscription]]) when they settled in Russia, the Russian monarchy gradually eroded their specific rights as time went on. Conscription was eventually reinstated; this was especially harmful to the Mennonites, who practice pacifism. Throughout the 19th century, pressure increased from the Russian government to culturally assimilate. Many Germans from Russia found it necessary to emigrate to avoid conscription and preserve their culture. About 100,000 immigrated by 1900, settling primarily in the Dakotas, Kansas, and Nebraska. The south-central part of North Dakota was known as "the German-Russian triangle". A smaller number moved farther west, finding employment as ranchers and cowboys.
[[File:Alexanderwohl-church.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Alexanderwohl Mennonite Church]] in Kansas]]
The largest groups settled mainly in the area of the [[Great Plains]]:  [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Saskatchewan]] in Canada; and North Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and nearby areas in the US. Outside that area, they also settled in Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, especially in Portland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.volgagermans.net/portland/|title=Volga Germans in Portland||website=Volgagermans.net|access-date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington, Wisconsin, and [[Fresno County]] in California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]].  They often succeeded in [[dryland farming]], which they had practiced in Russia. Many of the immigrants who arrived between 1870 and 1912 spent a period doing farm labor, especially in northeastern Colorado and in Montana along the lower [[Yellowstone River]] in [[sugar beet]] fields.  Colonies kept in touch with each other through newspapers, especially ''[[Der Staats Anzeiger]]'', based in North Dakota.

Germans from Russia also settled in [[Argentina]] (see [[Crespo, Argentina|Crespo]] and [[Coronel Suárez]] among others, also [[German Argentine]]), [[Paraguay]], and [[Brazil]] (see [[German-Brazilian]]s). Most Volga Germans who settled in Latin America were [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]]. Many Catholic Volga Germans chose South America as their new homeland because the nations shared their religion.

==Language==
The greatest number of Volga Germans emigrated from [[Hesse]] and the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], and spoke [[Hessian dialects|Hessian]] and [[Palatine German language|Palatine]] [[Rhine Franconian dialects]]&lt;ref name="Koch"&gt;Fred C. Koch, ''The Volga Germans: In Russia and the Americas, from 1763 to the Present'' (1977, {{ISBN|0271012366}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GandA"&gt;''Germany and the Americas: O-Z'' (2005, {{ISBN|1851096280}})&lt;/ref&gt; to which the colonists from other regions, and even from other countries like Sweden, assimilated.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, page 238: "even nationals like Scandinavians, Frenchmen, Italians, and Englishmen among the colonists became submerged and lost ethnically in the highly dominant Rhineland culture and dialects."&lt;/ref&gt; Some Volga German dialects are very similar to [[Pennsylvania German language]], another Palatine Rhine Franconian language; in either dialect, one could say:&lt;ref name="Koch"/&gt;
* ''(spelled per standard German pronunciation rules:)'' Mehr volla mohl gaern in die sche gehl Kaerrich geha.
* ''(spelled per English pronunciation rules:)'' Mair volla mole gairn in dee shay gehl Kairrikh gai'uh.

Volga Germans borrowed some Russian words, like ''Erbus'' "watermelon" from Russian ''арбуз'' "watermelon",&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the American Historical Society of Germans from Russia'', volumes 15-16, (1992), page 46: Who could ever forget the ''eigemachte{{sic}} Erbusen''? The Germans call them ''Wassermelone''. [''Ed. note'': ''Erbus'' probably was borrowed from the Russian ''arbuz'' (watermelon).] For this delicacy the watermelons would be picked late in the season when they were not too ripe and would remain firm.&lt;/ref&gt; which they carried with them on their subsequent moves to North America&lt;ref name="GandA"/&gt; and Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;''Veröffentlichungen des Instituts für Volkskunde der Universität Wien'', volume 4 (Verlag A. Schendl), page 49: "Grün wie Schnee / Weiß wie Klee / Rot wie Blut / Schmeckt sehr gut. (''Erbus'', so nannten die Rußlanddeutschen die ''Wassermelone'', Teresa Hardt, [[Urdinarrain]])"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shah Zaman Durrani Sadozai''', ([[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]], [[Arabic]]: {{Nastaliq|زماں شاہ درانی سدوزئی}}), (c. 1770 – 1844) was ruler of the [[Durrani Empire]] from 1793 until 1800. He was the grandson of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] and the fifth son of [[Timur Shah Durrani]]. An ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] like the rest of his family and Durrani rulers, Shah Zaman became the third [[Afghanistan|King of Afghanistan]]. Zaman Shah belonged to Sadozai family

== Early Years ==
[[File:Zaman Shah Durrani in Durbar.jpg|thumb|left|Zaman Shah Durrani in Durbar]]
[[File:Silver rupee issued by Zaman Shah Durrani (struck at the Peshawar mint).jpg|thumb|Silver [[rupee]] of Zaman Shah Durrani, struck at the [[Peshawar]] mint, dated 1797]]
He seized the throne of the [[Durrani Empire]] on the death of his father, [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur Shah]]. He defeated his rivals, his brothers, with the help of Sardar Payenda Khan, chief of the [[Barakzai dynasty|Barakzais]]. He extracted an oath of allegiance from the final challenger, Mahmud, and in return relinquished the governorship of [[Herat]]. In so doing, he divided the power base between Herat and his own government in [[Kabul]], a division which was to remain in place for a century. Kabul was the primary base of power, while Herat maintained a state of quasi-independence. Kandahar was fought over for the spoils.

During his reign he tried to combine his dispersed relatives together who were deported by his father Timur Shah. His uncle Saifullah Khan Durrani, his sons Mohammad Umar, Bashir Ahmad Khan and Shams Ur Rehman, his cousins Faizullah Khan and Abdullah Khan lived in [[Akora Khattak]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} in present-day [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. They were contacted to come back to Afghanistan but without success. Saifullah Khan died in 1779 and after that the family was led by Faizullah Khan but he disliked the bad habits of Abdullah Khan and Bashir Ahmad Khan and left Akora Khattak and went to [[Bannu]] without informing his relatives.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Later on, after the death of his wife, Abdullah Khan Durrani migrated to [[Kohat]] in 1791 where he married a widow, Pashmina.

Shah Zaman tried his best to recombine his family members and relatives so as to gain power but many of them were living an unknown life. Some of them have even been forgotten their identity.

He attempted to repeat his father's success in [[India]], but his attempts at expansion attempts were failed by the Sikhs and also brought him into conflict with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]. The British induced the [[Qajar dynasty|Shah of Persia]] to invade Durrani, thwarting his plans by forcing him to protect his own lands.

In his own lands things went well for Zaman, at least initially. He was able to force Mahmud from Herat and into a [[Persia]]n exile. However, Mahmud established an alliance with [[Fateh Khan]], with whose support he was able to strike back in 1800, and Zaman had to flee toward [[Peshawar]]. But he never made it; on the way, he was captured, blinded and imprisoned in Kabul, in the [[Bala Hissar, Kabul|Bala Hissar]].

==Later Years==
Zaman Shah was rescued when his brother Shujah Shah Durrani became the king after toppling Mahmud Shah Durrani in 1803. He lived in 'blinded' luxury up to 1809 when Mahmud Shah Durrani again seized the throne. While his brother, Shujah Shah was captured by the Governor of Attock, Zaman Shah managed to escape with the zenana (ladies of the house) of his brother and his own to Lahore and sought asylum from [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] in 1810. He was first allowed to stay at Rawalpindi but, in 1811, Zaman Shah received full state honours at Lahore by Sikh ruler [[Ranjit Singh]]. After a few years, Zaman Shah moved to Ludhiana where he lived with a  pension of Rs 24,000 from the British. Zaman Shah never went back to Afghanistan even after his brother, Shujah Shah Durrani was reinstated on the throne with the help of the British and the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh. He died at Ludhiana in 1844.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newslaundry.com/2017/10/24/general-analyses-panag-ahmad-sirhindi|title=Newslaundry - Sabki Dhulai|first=|last=Newslaundry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried at the mazar of [[Ahmad Sirhindi|Ahmad al-Fārūqī al-Sirhindī]] in [[Sirhind]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] (India).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
