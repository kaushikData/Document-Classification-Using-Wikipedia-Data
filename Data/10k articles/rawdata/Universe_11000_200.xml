The '''1888 Sundsvall fire''' ({{lang-sv|Sundsvallsbranden 1888}}) was a fire in [[Sundsvall]], [[Sweden]] on 25 June 1888. The fire occurred during a storm, allowing the fire to spread fast among the wooden houses in town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1602&amp;artikel=482253|title=Branden i Sundsvall 1888 |trans-title=1888 Sundsvall fire |publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]] |language=Swedish|date=8 October 2004 |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, a [[Umeå city fire|fire also occurred]] in [[Umeå]].

==History==
The spark from the steam boat ''Selånger'' traveling on [[Selångersån]] landed in the brewhouse of the widow Märta Charlotta Styf on Stora Nygatan. The fire was quick - and devastating. At 12:25 o'clock all of the city's bells rang to warn people that a fire had broken out. But the fire was overpowering. Strong winds to the northwest and the dry hot air made did that the wooden houses one by one soon was devoured by the flames. 9,000 people became homeless in just 9 hours. In addition to thousands of people left homeless the property damage was estimated to SEK 30 million, corresponding to almost SEK 2 billion (USD 241.42 million) in 2015. In the wake of the fire the city was looted on what was left. When evening came on 25 June the city of Sundsvall was a smoking ruin.&lt;ref name="Fahlberg (2015)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.st.nu/medelpad/sundsvall/sundsvallsbranden-nyheten-som-st-missade |newspaper=[[Sundsvalls Tidning]] |title=Sundsvallsbranden – nyheten som ST missade |trans-title=Sundsvall fire – the news that ST missed |first=Kenneth |last=Fahlberg |date=8 June 2015 |access-date=29 March 2016 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major investigation into the cause of the fire was started, which included hearing of the captain of ''Selånger''. He stated that he saw smoke rising up through the bridge cabin chimney when  passing the Styfska yard, a claim which, however, contested by all the witnesses. There was no other reasonable explanation than that the fire was started by sparks from one of the steamboats ''Selånger'', or possibly ''Högom''. Four people died in the fire: the workers Mikael Olof Norvall and Charlotta Eufrosina Askling, the maritime pilot C.E. Carlsson and a man so severely burned that he could not be identified.&lt;ref name="Fahlberg (2015)"/&gt;

The coppersmith journeyman Arvid Göhle from [[Hudiksvall]] without regard to himself saved several lives, including the wife of tailor Otzén and her newborn child that was born during the morning of that day. Without considering to first save his own belongings he went into the house and carried out the bed with the wife, the newborn baby and a little girl on the farm. With the bed set on a cart, he pulled the whole equipage through the burning city via Norrmalm and on to Heffners, away from the flames. When he returned to his own home everything he had owned was burnt.&lt;ref name="Fahlberg (2015)"/&gt;

The '''Alpaslan-2 Dam''' is an [[embankment dam]] currently under construction on the [[Murat River]] in [[Muş Province]], [[Turkey]]. The dam is located about {{Convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the provincial capital, [[Muş]]. The primary purpose of the dam is [[hydroelectric]] power production and irrigation. Its power station will have an installed capacity of 280 MW and the reservoir will help irrigate {{Convert|78000|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=280 Million Payment|url=http://www.sarktelgraf.com/haberdetay/8925-hak-sahiplerine-280-milyon-odeme-yapildi.html|publisher=Topkan Haber Ajansi|accessdate=30 May 2013|language=Turkish|date=7 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917234915/http://www.sarktelgraf.com/haberdetay/8925-hak-sahiplerine-280-milyon-odeme-yapildi.html|archive-date=2013-09-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enerjisa Power Generation Inc. acquired the license for the power station from Özışık İnsaat &amp; Enerji in April 2011 and Yenigün Construction started excavating the diversion tunnels May 2012.&lt;ref name=LICE&gt;{{cite web|title=ENERJISA TAKES OVER THE 204 MW ALPASLAN 2 DAM AND HEPP|url=http://www.enerjisa.com.tr/en-US/Media/Pages/PressBulletin_84.aspx|publisher=EnerjisaSA|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=19 April 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615204323/http://www.enerjisa.com.tr/en-US/Media/Pages/PressBulletin_84.aspx|archive-date=2013-06-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diversion tunnels are expected to be complete by the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alpaslan II Barajı ve HES 1|url=http://www.yenigun.com.tr/lang_eng/devamproje/proje10.asp?sayfa=projeler|publisher=Yenigun|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late May 2013 [[Pöyry]] was awarded the detailed design of the dam, power station, spillway and switch yard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pöyry awarded detailed design services assignment for Alpaslan II dam and hydroelectric power plant, Turkey|url=http://www.informazione.it/c/0409D99C-704E-4031-BC19-4B23010DF1D6/Poyry-awarded-detailed-design-services-assignment-for-Alpaslan-II-dam-and-hydroelectric-power-plant-Turkey|publisher=Informazione|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enerjisa expects the project to be complete in 2016.&lt;ref name=LICE/&gt;

The '''Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962''' occurred on March 5–9, 1962 along the [[Atlantic Ocean|mid-Atlantic]] coast of the [[United States]]. Also known as the '''Great March Storm of 1962''', it was considered by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] to be one of the most destructive storms ever to affect the [[mid-Atlantic states]]. Classified as a level 5 or Extreme [[Nor'easter]] by the Dolan-Davis scale for classification of Atlantic Nor'easters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=Maurice|title=Encyclopedia of Coastal Science|date=Nov 8, 2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-1903-6|page=680}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was one of the ten worst storms in the United States in the 20th century. It lingered through five high [[tide]]s over a three-day period, killing 40&amp;nbsp;people, injuring over 1,000, and causing hundreds of millions in property damage in six states. The storm also deposited significant snowfall over the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], with a regional snowfall index of 12.663.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/rsi/societal-impacts/southeast|title=Regional Snowfall Index (RSI)|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meteorological history and naming==
On March&amp;nbsp;4, 1962, a large [[low pressure area]] developed along a [[cold front]] off the southeast coast of the United States, with several ill-defined circulation centers. At the same time, a large [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] was over [[Atlantic Canada]], and a powerful [[upper-level low]] was over the [[Ohio Valley]]. The upper-level low reached the  North Carolina coast on March&amp;nbsp;6, which aided in the intensification of the frontal system, reaching a minimum [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] of {{convert|979|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}. From March&amp;nbsp;6&amp;ndash;8, the storm drifted northeastward, but quicker movement was [[Block (meteorology)|blocked]] by the ridge.&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt; The interaction between the storm and the ridge produced a steep [[pressure gradient]] that produced hurricane-force wind gusts along the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic coast]]. The storm also produced a {{convert|600|mi|km|abbr=on}} long [[Fetch (geography)|fetch]] of flow of winds from the Atlantic Ocean, building the height of the waves as high as {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=great/&gt;&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt; Storm conditions diminished along the coast on March&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;Ref name="mwl"&gt;{{cite journal|author=A.I. Cooperman|author2=H.E.

In most areas, the peak of the storm in most areas occurred on March&amp;nbsp;7, which was the [[Christian]] holiday of [[Ash Wednesday]], the first day of [[Lent]] that year. Outer Banks writer Aycock Brown named the coastal storm as the "Ash Wednesday Storm".&lt;ref name="cr"&gt;{{cite news|title=Remembering the Ash Wednesday Storm|date=March 9, 2012|author=Frank Tursi|publisher=Coastal Review|url=https://www.coastalreview.org/2012/03/remembering-the-ash-wednesday-storm/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;Ref name="twc"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Weather Channel|author=Brian Donovan|title=Ash Wednesday 1962: The Most Extreme Nor'easter on Record to Hit the Mid-Atlantic Coast|date=March 1, 2018|accessdate=July 27, 2018|url=https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/march-1962-ash-wednesday-storm-noreaster-mid-atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their [[Mariners Weather Log]] summary, the [[U.S. Weather Bureau]] referred to the weather system as the "Great Atlantic Coastal Storm".&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt; The storm is also known as the "Five High Storm" because it lingered off the Atlantic Coast of the northeast United States over a period of five high tides.&lt;ref name="nj"&gt;{{cite news|author=Lisa Rosa|date=March 8, 2012|title=50 years later, N.J. remembers the storm that swallowed the Jersey Shore|publisher=NJ.com|accessdate=July 27, 2018|url=https://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/50_years_later_nj_remembers_wh.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Impacts==
The Weather Bureau described the storm as "one of the most damaging [[extratropical cyclone]]s to hit the United States coastline," with damage estimated around $200&amp;nbsp;million. The storm destroyed 1,793&amp;nbsp;houses, and damaged another 16,782.&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt; According to the [[American Red Cross]], the storm killed 40&amp;nbsp;people in the United States,&lt;ref name=great/&gt; with 1,252&amp;nbsp;people injured.&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt;

At the same time of the storm reaching its maturity, the moon was at its [[perigee]] &amp;ndash; its closest point to [[Earth]] during its 28-day [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbit) &amp;ndash; while the moon was also in alignment with the sun and moon, a set of conditions known as the [[Perigean spring tide]].&lt;Ref name="cr"/&gt; High tides lasted over five successive high tides. The large storm dropped heavy snowfall as far south as Alabama, with the heaviest accumulations in western Virginia and Maryland. Little precipitation occurred to the storm's north over New England.&lt;ref name=great/&gt;&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt;

During the storm, several ships came into danger amid the high waves. The British vessel ''Arthur Albright'' was blown ashore at [[Port Tampa, Florida]]. About 200&amp;nbsp;mi (320&amp;nbsp;km) southeast of Charleston, three people were rescued when the yacht ''Guinevere'' sank during the storm. Offshore Cape Hatteras, a {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} tanker broke in two; one member of the crew died while attempting to launch lifeboats, but the remaining crew were rescued by a passing cruise ship and the [[United States Navy|Navy]]. Two ships &amp;ndash; one off Cape Hatteras and another east of Virginia &amp;ndash; sustained damage to their [[rudder]]s. A {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} wave damaged the [[United States lightship Chesapeake (LV-116)|Chesapeake lightship]] east of [[Cape Henry, Virginia]]; the lightship had to evacuate, and the Coast Guard sent another ship in its place. Two freighters were washed ashore New Jersey, and two fishing trawlers with nine people onboard went missing.&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt;

===Southeast and inland United States===

The weather system in the southeastern United States dropped snow as far south as Alabama, and dropped the temperature in [[Miami, Florida]] to {{convert|31|F|C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=great&gt;{{cite book|first=Margaret|last=Buchholz|author2=Larry Savadove|year=1993|title=Great Storms of the Jersey Shore|publisher=Down the Shore Publishing|isbn=0-945582-51-X|pages=148–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold, northerly winds first affected Florida on March&amp;nbsp;5, with peak gusts of {{convert|42|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]]. Tides reached {{convert|6.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} above normal in [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]]. The high tides caused minor beach erosion and extensive drifting of sand. Flooding entered oceanfront properties, damaging docks, streets, and cabanas. Monetary damage was estimated around $1&amp;nbsp;million. Impacts were minimal in Georgia. In neighboring South Carolina, the high tides eroded beaches, with [[Folly Beach, South Carolina|Folly Beach]] losing up to {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} of sand. [[Charleston, South Carolina]] reported wind gusts of {{convert|42|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and tides {{convert|8.1|ft|m|abbr=on}} above normal. The storm wrecked a few beachside cottages, and one person drowned along the [[Santee River|Santee-Cooper Lakes]].&lt;Ref name="mwl"/&gt; 

A [[gale warning]] was issued for North Carolina on March&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;ref name="cr"/&gt; Along the Atlantic side of the [[Outer Banks]] of North Carolina, high waves eroded sand dunes and created a new {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} inlet on [[Hatteras Island]], about 2&amp;nbsp;mi (3&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Buxton, North Carolina|Buxton]]. Several sections of [[North Carolina Highway 12]] were washed out or covered with sand, covering cars with sand.&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt;

Heavy snowfall occurred in North Carolina and into Virginia, reaching {{convert|42|in|cm|abbr=on}} in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] of western Virginia. [[Winchester, Virginia]] reported {{convert|23|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snowfall, a city record at the time.&lt;Ref name="twc"/&gt;

===Mid-Atlantic states and New England===
[[File:Harvey Cedars 1962.png|thumb|Beach erosion and wave overwash in [[Harvey Cedars, New Jersey]]]]
In [[Norfolk, Virginia]], the storm produced the third highest tide on record, and highest unrelated to a tropical cyclone, reaching {{convert|8.2|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The tides flooded thousands of cars and damaged thousands of houses, especially near the coast. Wind gusts in the [[Hampton Roads]] area reached {{convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, although even stronger winds occurred over [[Chesapeake Bay]], reaching {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} gusts and producing {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} waves.&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt; Construction of the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel]] was disrupted when the waves knocked over the world's largest [[pile driver]], which stood on four {{Convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} legs. The $1.5&amp;nbsp;million machine was buried in sand, and the two workers onboard were rescued by helicopter.&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dave Forster|title=When men split the sea: Building the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel |date=April 13, 2014|newspaper=The Virginian-Pilot |accessdate=July 28, 2018|url=https://pilotonline.com/news/local/transportation/article_1ed50968-e8cd-11e7-9663-0f540dac1d6c.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]], high waves damaged installations at the [[Wallops Flight Facility]]. Thousands of people had to be evacuated to the mainland during the storm. On [[Chincoteague, Virginia|Chincoteague Island]], the storm damaged boats and homes and also killed several livestock.&lt;Ref name="mwl"/&gt; Several [[Chincoteague Pony|Chincoteague Ponies]] died during the floods, but [[Misty of Chincoteague|Misty]] &amp;ndash; the subject of a book and movie &amp;ndash; survived.&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt; Damage throughout Virginia reached over $30&amp;nbsp;million, with half in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], and there were five deaths in the state.&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt;

At the [[Chincoteague, Virginia|Town of Chincoteague]] on Virginia's [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Eastern Shore]] near the border with [[Maryland]], six feet (2 m) of water covered parts of Main Street, and most of the island was flooded to various depths. On adjacent [[Assateague Island]], the Chincoteague Fire Company lost a portion of its herd of wild [[Chincoteague Ponies]]. Misty, the local pony made famous by [[Marguerite Henry]]'s award-winning children's book ''[[Misty of Chincoteague]]'' and the 1961 movie [[Misty (film)|''Misty'']], survived by being brought inside a house. Also along the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], at [[Wallops Island]], a million dollars in damage was done to [[Wallops Flight Facility|NASA's Wallops Flight Facility]].

Along the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland]] and in eastern Delaware, the high waves eroded beaches and damaged boardwalks. In [[Ocean City, Maryland]], wind gusts reached {{convert|64|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, while tides were estimated at {{convert|5|to|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} above normal. The tides washed away dunes and beaches Flooding closed down roads and entered houses along the coast, causing significant damage to [[seaside resort]]s.&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt; Farther inland, the floods killed over 1.2&amp;nbsp;million [[broiler]] chickens and many incubating eggs due to power outages.&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt; Saltwater intrusion damaged fields in northern Delaware.&lt;Ref name="sd"&gt;{{cite report|journal=Storm Data|title=Storm Data and Unusual Weather Phenomena|volume=4|number=3|date=March 1962|publisher=United States Department of Commerce|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HB17iJB|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url=https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/orders/IPS/IPS-9522E59B-335B-4DA8-826F-CD7C253D742F.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2018|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Delaware Breakwater]], winds reached {{convert|72|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and the highest tide was {{convert|9.3|ft|m|abbr=on}} above normal before the tidal gauge failed; the high tide was estimated at {{convert|11|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Damage in the region was estimated at $50&amp;nbsp;million, and ten people were killed &amp;ndash; seven fatalities were in Delaware and the other three were in Maryland.&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt;

Further north, 7.6&amp;nbsp;m (25&amp;nbsp;ft) waves struck [[Ocean City, Maryland]] and the resort developments beginning on [[Assateague Island]] were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bayjournal.com/article/last_cedar_island_house_slips_into_sea&lt;/ref&gt; Waves more than 12&amp;nbsp;m (40&amp;nbsp;ft) high occurred at [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware]] destroying the boardwalk and beach front homes. The flow of water flooded waterfront areas of Philadelphia and [[Camden, New Jersey]]. 

The Weather Bureau forecast for Atlantic City failed to anticipate the severity of the storm, and there was little warning for the flooding along the coasts.&lt;ref name=great/&gt; High waves battered the [[Jersey Shore]] and the Delaware Bay, along with strong wind gusts, reaching {{convert|73|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in [[Long Branch, New Jersey|Long Branch]]. Damage was estimated at $80&amp;nbsp;million statewide, one of the most damaging storms on record for the coast. The highest tide in the state was {{convert|7.7|ft|m|abbr=on}} in [[Harrison, New Jersey|Harrison]]. High waves and tides changed the New Jersey coastline. Floodwaters breached [[Long Beach Island]] in five locations, and about half of [[Harvey Cedars, New Jersey|Harvey Cedars]] was wrecked during the storm. In coastal towns, about 4,000&amp;nbsp;houses were destroyed and another 40,000 were severely damaged after being inundated with {{convert|4|to|5|ft|abbr=on}} of water. In Atlantic City, the waves knocked a {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} barge into [[Steel Pier]], which washed out a quarter-mile section, including the tank used for the [[diving horse]]. Also lost was the wave sensor, which last reported a tide of {{convert|6.9|ft|m|abbr=on}} on March&amp;nbsp;6. The estimated high tide was {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} above normal. Stranded residents along the coast attempted to evacuate by boat, but were impeded by icy waters. About 2,000&amp;nbsp;people were evacuated by army trucks and helicopters. Boardwalks were damaged in several towns, and rail lines were shut down. The high tides cut power and phone lines, which sparked fires that were unable to be reached by fire trucks until the floods subsided. There 14&amp;nbsp;fatalities, as well as 12&amp;nbsp;people missing and presumed killed.&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt;&lt;ref name=great/&gt; [[Avalon, New Jersey]] lost 6 blocks. 

In New York, high waves and tides affected [[Long Island]] and the [[New York metro]]. [[Willets Point, Queens|Willets Point]] reported a high tide of {{convert|8.6|ft|m|abbr=on}} before the gauge failed. Waves up to {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} in height washed away about 100&amp;nbsp;houses in the state, including 35 on [[Fire Island]], and flooded coastal roads, forcing families to evacuate. [[The Battery (Manhattan)|The Battery]] reported wind gusts of {{Convert|56|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} during the storm. The winds knocked down power lines, trees, and signs. Damage in New York was estimated at over $10&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt;

High winds and waves affected southern New England, with a peak wind gust of {{convert|84|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on [[Block Island, Rhode Island]]; the same station recorded sustained winds of {{convert|76|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The highest tide in New England was {{convert|13.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. High waves flooded coastal and low-lying areas, inundating roads and houses' cellars, and washing over seawalls as far north as [[Portland, Maine]]. Near [[New Haven, Connecticut]], a barge and an oyster boat sank. Little precipitation occurred in New England, and the Weather Bureau referred to the storm as a "dry nor'easter". Flights in and around the region were canceled during the storm. Damage in New England was estimated at $1.3&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="mwl"/&gt; Extensive damage to trees and structures and beach erosion was also reported along the southern New England coast.&lt;ref name="sd"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the storm, stranded residents in the Outer Banks had food and emergency supplies delivered by ferry.&lt;ref name="cr"/&gt; The governor of Virginia declared a state of emergency for the Hampton Roads area and the Eastern Shore.&lt;Ref name="sd"/&gt; President [[John F. Kennedy]] declared a disaster area for the affected areas in New Jersey. Following the storm, the police and National Guard patrolled the damaged barrier islands to keep order. Shore towns cleared sand and restored road access ahead of the summer tourist season.&lt;ref name=great/&gt; The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] made emergency [[beach nourishment|beach replenishment]]s to shore towns to protect from further storms.&lt;Ref name="nj"/&gt;

Perhaps a fitting memorial to what was lost in the storm is [[Assateague Island National Seashore]], a unit of the [[National Park Service]]. In the 1950s, some 5,000 private lots comprising what is now National Park Service land were zoned and sold for resort development. The Ash Wednesday Storm halted the plans for development, as it destroyed the few existing structures on the island and ripped roads apart. Instead, in 1965, Assateague Island became a [[National Seashore]].

==Popular culture==
Shortly after the storm subsided, [[Marguerite Henry#Misty of Chincoteague|Misty]], the famous horse from Chincoteague who spent the storm in the family's kitchen (her barn was flooded) gave birth to a [[foal]]. The family named her "Stormy", laying the basis for another book in [[Marguerite Henry]]'s award-winning ''[[Misty of Chincoteague]]'' series. The new book was named ''Stormy, Misty's Foal''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4576">'''Carbon dioxide equivalent''' ('''CDE''') and '''equivalent carbon dioxide''' ('''{{CO2}}e''' and '''{{CO2}}eq''') are two related but distinct measures for describing how much [[global warming]] a given type and amount of [[greenhouse gas]] may cause, using the functionally equivalent amount or concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) as the reference.

== Global warming potential ==
{{Main|Global warming potential}}

Carbon dioxide equivalency is a [[quantity]] that describes, for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse gas, the amount of {{CO2|link=yes}} that would have the same [[global warming potential]] (GWP), when measured over a specified timescale (generally, 100 years). Carbon dioxide equivalency thus reflects the time-integrated radiative forcing of a quantity of ''emissions'' or rate of greenhouse gas emission—a ''flow'' into the atmosphere—rather than the instantaneous value of the radiative forcing of the ''stock'' (concentration) of greenhouse gases ''in the atmosphere'' described by {{CO2}}e.

The carbon dioxide equivalency for a gas is obtained by multiplying the mass and the GWP of the gas. The following [[Units of measurement|units]] are commonly used:
*By the [[UN]] climate change panel [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]: n×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; [[tonne]]s of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent (GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq).
*In industry: million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (MMTCDE).
*For vehicles: g of carbon dioxide equivalents / km (gCDE/km).

For example, the GWP for methane over 100 years is 34&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.climatechange2013.org/report/full-report/ |contribution=Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis |title=IPCC, 2013: Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Ch.8, p. 711-714, Table 8.7. |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for nitrous oxide 298. This means that emissions of 1 million metric tonnes of methane and nitrous oxide respectively is equivalent to emissions of 34 and 298 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc-wg1.unibe.ch/publications/wg1-ar4/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf IPCC AR4 WG1, Table 2.14, p.212]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equivalent carbon dioxide ==
Equivalent {{CO2}} ({{CO2}}e) is the concentration of {{CO2}} that would cause the same level of [[radiative forcing]] as a given type and concentration of greenhouse gas. Examples of such greenhouse gases are [[methane]], [[perfluorocarbons]], and [[nitrous oxide]]. {{CO2}}e is expressed as parts per million by [[volume]], [[ppmv]].

: {{CO2}}e calculation examples:
:* The radiative forcing for pure {{CO2}} is approximated by &lt;math&gt;RF = \alpha \ln(C/C_0)&lt;/math&gt; where C is the present concentration, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, 5.35, and &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt; is the pre-industrial concentration, 280 ppm. Hence the value of {{CO2}}e for an arbitrary gas mixture with a known radiative forcing is given by &lt;math&gt;C_0 \exp(RF/\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; in ppmv.
:* To calculate the radiative forcing for a 1998 gas mixture, [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] 2001 gives the radiative forcing (relative to 1750) of various gases as: {{CO2}}=1.46 (corresponding to a concentration of 365 ppmv), CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;=0.48, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=0.15 and other minor gases =0.01 W/m2. The sum of these is 2.10 W/m2. Inserting this to the above formula, we obtain {{CO2}}e = 412 ppmv.
:* To calculate the {{CO2}}e of the additional radiative forcing calculated from April 2016's updated data:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | title=Current Greenhouse Gas Concentrations
 | author=Blasing, T.J.
 | doi=10.3334/CDIAC/atg.032
 | date=April 2016
 | url=http://cdiac.ornl.gov/pns/current_ghg.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ∑ RF(GHGs) = 3.3793, thus {{CO2}}e = 280 e&lt;sup&gt;3.3793/5.35&lt;/sup&gt; ppmv = 526.6 ppmv.

The '''center of pressure ''' is the point where the total sum of a [[pressure]] field acts on a body, causing a [[force]] to act through that point. The total force vector acting at the center of pressure is the value of the integrated vectorial pressure field.  The resultant force and center of pressure location produce equivalent force and moment on the body as the original pressure field. Pressure fields occur in both static and dynamic fluid mechanics.  Specification of the center of pressure, the reference point from which the center of pressure is referenced, and the associated force vector allows the moment generated about any point to be computed by a translation from the reference point to the desired new point. It is common for the center of pressure to be located on the body, but in fluid flows it is possible for the pressure field to exert a [[Moment (physics)|moment]] on the body of such magnitude that the center of pressure is located outside the body.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Hydrostatic example (dam)==
Since the forces of water on a dam are [[hydrostatic]] forces, they vary linearly with depth.  The total force on the dam is then the integral of the pressure multiplied by the width of the dam as a function of the depth.  The center of pressure is located at the [[centroid]] of the triangular shaped pressure field 2/3 from the top of the water line. The hydrostatic force and tipping moment on the dam about some point can be computed from the total force and center of pressure location relative to the point of interest.

==Historical usage for sailboats==
Center of pressure is used in [[sailboat]] design to represent the position on a [[sail]] where the [[aerodynamic force]] is concentrated.

The relationship of the aerodynamic center of pressure on the sails to the hydrodynamic center of pressure (referred to as the [[center of lateral resistance]]) on the hull determines the behavior of the boat in the wind.  This behavior is known as the "helm" and is either a [[weather helm]] or lee helm. A slight amount of weather helm is thought by some sailors to be a desirable situation, both from the standpoint of the "feel" of the helm, and the tendency of the boat to head slightly to windward in stronger gusts, to some extent self-feathering the sails. Other sailors disagree and prefer a neutral helm.

The fundamental cause of "helm", be it weather or lee, is the relationship of the center of pressure of the sail plan to the center of lateral resistance of the hull. If the center of pressure is astern of the center of lateral resistance, a weather helm, the tendency of the vessel is to want to turn into the wind.

If the situation is reversed, with the center of pressure forward of the center of lateral resistance of the hull, a "lee" helm will result, which is generally considered undesirable, if not dangerous. Too much of either helm is not good, since it forces the helmsman to hold the rudder deflected to counter it, thus inducing extra drag beyond what a vessel with neutral or minimal helm would experience.&lt;ref&gt;Marchaj, C.A. (1985). Sailing Theory and Practice, Revised edition. Putnam. {{ISBN|978-0-396-08428-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft aerodynamics==
A stable configuration is desirable not only in sailing, but in aircraft design as well.  Aircraft design therefore borrowed the term center of pressure.  And like a sail, a rigid non-symmetrical [[airfoil]] not only produces lift, but a [[moment (physics)|moment]].
The center of pressure of an aircraft is the point where all of the aerodynamic pressure field may be represented by a single force vector with no moment.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John D., ''Aircraft Performance and Design'', Section 2.3&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar idea is the [[aerodynamic center]] which is the point on an [[airfoil]] where the [[pitching moment]] produced by the aerodynamic forces is constant with [[angle of attack]].&lt;ref name="selkirk"&gt;{{cite web

The [[aerodynamic center]] plays an important role in analysis of the [[longitudinal static stability]] of all [[flying machine]]s.  It is desirable that when the pitch angle and angle of attack of an aircraft are disturbed (by, for example [[turbulence]]) that the aircraft returns to its original trimmed pitch angle and [[angle of attack]] without a pilot or [[autopilot]] changing the control surface deflection. For an aircraft to return towards its trimmed attitude, without input from a pilot or autopilot, it must have positive [[longitudinal static stability]].&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Sections 16.1 and 16.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missile aerodynamics==
Missiles typically do not have a preferred plane or direction of maneuver and thus have symmetric airfoils.  Since the center of pressure for symmetric airfoils is relatively constant for small angle of attack, missile engineers typically speak of the complete center of pressure of the entire vehicle for stability and control analysis.  In missile analysis, the center of pressure is typically defined as the center of the additional pressure field due to a change in the angle of attack off of the trim angle of attack.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, F.G., Approximate Methods for Weapon Aerodynamics, AIAA Progress in Astronatuics and Aeronautics, Volume 186
&lt;/ref&gt;

For unguided rockets the trim position is typically zero angle of attack and the center of pressure is defined to be the center of pressure of the resultant flow field on the entire vehicle resulting from a very small angle of attack (that is, the center of pressure in the limit as angle of attack goes to zero).  For positive stability in missiles, the total vehicle center of pressure defined as given above must be further from the nose of the vehicle than the [[center of gravity]].  In missiles at lower angles of attack, the contributions to the center of pressure are dominated by the nose, wings, and fins.  The normalized [[normal force]] coefficient derivative with respect to the angle of attack of each component multiplied by the location of the center of pressure can be used to compute a centroid representing the total center of pressure.  The center of pressure of the added flow field is behind the center of gravity and the additional force "points" in the direction of the added angle of attack; this produces a moment that pushes the vehicle back to the trim position.

In guided missiles where the fins can be moved to trim the vehicles in different angles of attack, the center of pressure is the center of pressure of the flow field at that angle of attack for the undeflected fin position.  This is the center of pressure of any small change in the angle of attack (as defined above).  Once again for positive static stability, this definition of center of pressure requires that the center of pressure be further from the nose than the center of gravity.  This ensures that any increased forces resulting from increased angle of attack results in increased restoring moment to drive the missile back to the trimmed position.  In missile analysis, positive static margin implies that the complete vehicle makes a restoring moment for any angle of attack from the trim position.

== Movement of center of pressure for aerodynamic fields ==
The center of pressure on a symmetric [[airfoil]] typically lies close to 25% of the chord length behind the leading edge of the airfoil.  (This is called the "quarter-chord point".)  For a symmetric airfoil, as [[angle of attack]] and [[lift coefficient]] change, the center of pressure does not move.  It remains around the quarter-chord point for angles of attack below the stalling angle of attack.  The role of center of pressure in the control characterization of aircraft takes a different form than in missiles.

On a [[Camber (aerodynamics)|cambered]] airfoil the center of pressure does not occupy a fixed location.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.6&lt;/ref&gt;  For a conventionally cambered airfoil, the center of pressure lies a little behind the quarter-chord point at maximum [[lift coefficient]] (large [[angle of attack]]), but as lift coefficient reduces (angle of attack reduces) the center of pressure moves toward the rear.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.11&lt;/ref&gt;  When the lift coefficient is zero an airfoil is generating no lift but a conventionally cambered airfoil generates a nose-down pitching moment, so the location of the center of pressure is an infinite distance behind the airfoil.

For a [[Camber (aerodynamics)#Definition|reflex-cambered]] airfoil, the center of pressure lies a little ahead of the quarter-chord point at maximum [[lift coefficient]] (large [[angle of attack]]), but as lift coefficient reduces (angle of attack reduces) the center of pressure moves forward.  When the lift coefficient is zero an airfoil is generating no lift but a reflex-cambered airfoil generates a nose-up pitching moment, so the location of the center of pressure is an infinite distance ahead of the airfoil.  This direction of movement of the center of pressure on a reflex-cambered airfoil has a stabilising effect.

The way the center of pressure moves as lift coefficient changes makes it difficult to use the center of pressure in the mathematical analysis of [[longitudinal static stability]] of an aircraft.  For this reason, it is much simpler to use the [[aerodynamic center]] when carrying out a mathematical analysis.  The aerodynamic center occupies a fixed location on an airfoil, typically close to the quarter-chord point.

The aerodynamic center is the conceptual starting point for longitudinal stability. The [[Stabilizer (aircraft)|horizontal stabilizer]] contributes extra stability and this allows the center of gravity to be a small distance aft of the aerodynamic center without the aircraft reaching neutral stability. The position of the center of gravity at which the aircraft has neutral stability is called the [[neutral point (aeronautics)|neutral point]].

'''Characterization''', when used in [[materials science]], refers to the broad and general process by which a material's structure and properties are probed and measured. It is a fundamental process in the field of materials science, without which no scientific understanding of engineering materials could be ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kumar|first1=Sam Zhang, Lin Li, Ashok|title=Materials characterization techniques|date=2009|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=1420042947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leng2009 /&gt; The scope of the term often differs; some definitions limit the term's use to techniques which study the microscopic structure and properties of materials,&lt;ref name=Leng2009&gt;{{cite book |last= Leng|first= Yang|date= 2009|title= Materials Characterization: Introduction to Microscopic and Spectroscopic Methods|url= |location= |publisher= Wiley |page= |isbn= 978-0-470-82299-9|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others use the term to refer to any materials analysis process including macroscopic techniques such as mechanical testing, thermal analysis and density calculation.&lt;ref name="Materials Characterization Techniques"&gt;{{cite book |last= Zhang|first= Sam|date= 2008|title= Materials Characterization Techniques|url= |location= |publisher= CRC Press|page= |isbn= 1420042947|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of the structures observed in materials characterization ranges from [[angstroms]], such as in the imaging of individual atoms and chemical bonds, up to centimeters, such as in the imaging of coarse grain structures in metals.

While many characterization techniques have been practiced for centuries, such as basic optical microscopy, new techniques and methodologies are constantly emerging. In particular the advent of the [[electron microscope]] and [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry]] in the 20th century has revolutionized the field, allowing the imaging and analysis of structures and compositions on much smaller scales than was previously possible, leading to a huge increase in the level of understanding as to why different materials show different properties and behaviors.&lt;ref name=EM&gt;Mathys, Daniel, Zentrum für Mikroskopie, [[University of Basel]]: ''Die Entwicklung der Elektronenmikroskopie vom Bild über die Analyse zum Nanolabor'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[atomic force microscopy]] has further increased the maximum possible resolution for analysis of certain samples in the last 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US4724318?dq=4724318&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RByQU8KZFe_Q7AbK_4Fg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA Patent US4724318 - Atomic force microscope and method for imaging surfaces with atomic resolution - Google Patents&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''composite fermion''' is the topological bound state of an electron and an even number of quantized [[Quantum vortex|vortices]], sometimes visually pictured as the bound state of an electron and, attached, an even number of magnetic flux quanta.&lt;ref name=CFbook&gt;{{cite book |title=Composite Fermions |author=J.K.

Vortices are an example of [[topological defect]], and also occur in other situations. Quantized vortices are found in type II superconductors, called [[Abrikosov vortex|Abrikosov vortices]]. Classical vortices are relevant to the [[Kosterlitz–Thouless transition|Berezenskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless]] transition in two-dimensional [[XY model]].

== Description ==
When electrons are confined to two dimensions, cooled to very low temperatures, and subjected to a strong magnetic field, their kinetic energy is quenched due to [[Landau quantization|Landau level quantization]]. Their behavior under such conditions is governed by the Coulomb repulsion alone, and they produce a strongly correlated quantum liquid. Experiments have shown&lt;ref name=CFbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heinonenbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=DPbook/&gt; that electrons minimize their interaction by capturing quantized vortices to become composite fermions.&lt;ref name=Jaincf&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.K. Jain |title=Composite fermion approach for fractional quantum Hall effect |year=1989 |journal= [[Physical Review Letters]] |volume= 63 |issue= 2 |pages=199–202 |doi=  10.1103/PhysRevLett.63.199|pmid=10040805 |bibcode = 1989PhRvL..63..199J }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between composite fermions themselves is often negligible to a good approximation, which makes them the physical [[quasiparticle]]s of this quantum liquid.

The signature quality of composite fermions, which is responsible for the otherwise unexpected behavior of this system, is that they experience a much smaller magnetic field than electrons. The magnetic field seen by composite fermions is given by

:&lt;math&gt; B^*=B-2p \rho \phi_0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; is the external magnetic field, &lt;math&gt; 2p &lt;/math&gt; is the number of vortices bound to composite fermion (also called the vorticity or the vortex charge of the composite fermion), &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the particle density in two dimensions, and &lt;math&gt;\phi_0=hc/e&lt;/math&gt; is called the “flux quantum” (which differs from the [[Magnetic flux quantum|superconducting flux quantum]] by a factor of two). The effective magnetic field is a direct manifestation of the existence of composite fermions, and also embodies a fundamental distinction between electrons and composite fermions.

Sometimes it is said that electrons "swallow" &lt;math&gt; 2p &lt;/math&gt; flux quanta each to transform into composite fermions, and the composite fermions then experience the residual magnetic field &lt;math&gt;B^*.&lt;/math&gt;  More accurately, the vortices bound to electrons produce their own [[geometric phase]]s which partly cancel the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect|Aharonov–Bohm phase]] due to the external magnetic field to generate a net geometric phase that can be modeled as an Aharonov–Bohm phase in an effective magnetic field &lt;math&gt; B^*.&lt;/math&gt;

The behavior of composite fermions is similar to that of electrons in an effective magnetic field &lt;math&gt;B^*.&lt;/math&gt; Electrons form Landau levels in a magnetic field, and the number of filled Landau levels is called the filling factor, given by the expression &lt;math&gt; \nu=\rho \phi_0/B.&lt;/math&gt; Composite fermions form Landau-like levels in the effective magnetic field &lt;math&gt;B^*,&lt;/math&gt; which are called composite fermion Landau levels or &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; levels. One defines the filling factor for composite fermions as  &lt;math&gt; \nu^*=\rho \phi_0/|B^*|.&lt;/math&gt; This gives the following relation between the electron and composite fermion filling factors

:&lt;math&gt; \nu=\frac{\nu^*}{2p\nu^*\pm 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The minus sign occurs when the effective magnetic field is antiparallel to the applied magnetic field, which happens when the geometric phase from the vortices overcompensate the Aharonov–Bohm phase.

== Experimental manifestations ==

The central statement of composite fermion theory is that the strongly correlated electrons at a magnetic field &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (or filling factor &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;) turn into weakly interacting composite fermions at a magnetic field &lt;math&gt;B^*&lt;/math&gt; (or composite fermion filling factor &lt;math&gt;\nu^*&lt;/math&gt;).  This allows an effectively single-particle explanation of the otherwise complex many-body behavior, with the interaction between electrons manifesting as an effective kinetic energy of composite fermions. Here are some of the phenomena arising from composite fermions:&lt;ref name=CFbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heinonenbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=DPbook/&gt;

=== Fermi sea ===

The effective magnetic field for composite fermions vanishes for &lt;math&gt;B=2p\rho\phi_0&lt;/math&gt;, where the filling factor for electrons is &lt;math&gt;\nu=1/2p&lt;/math&gt;.  Here, composite fermions make a Fermi sea.&lt;ref name=HLR&gt;{{cite journal |author1=B.I. Halperin |author2=P.A. Lee |author3=N.

Also, the observed direction of trajectory is opposite to that of electrons when &lt;math&gt;B^*&lt;/math&gt; is anti-parallel to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Cyclotron resonance ===

In addition to the cyclotron orbits, cyclotron resonance of composite fermions has also been observed by photoluminescence.&lt;ref name=cfresonance&gt;

=== Shubnikov de Haas oscillations ===

As the magnetic field is moved further away from &lt;math&gt;B^*=0&lt;/math&gt;, [[quantum oscillations (experimental technique)|quantum oscillations]] are observed that are periodic in &lt;math&gt;1/B^*.&lt;/math&gt; These are Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations of composite fermions.&lt;ref name=Leadley&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D.R.

From the analysis of the Shubnikov–de Haas experiments, one can deduce the effective mass and the quantum lifetime of composite fermions.

=== Integer quantum Hall effect ===

With further increase in &lt;math&gt;|B^*|&lt;/math&gt; or decrease in temperature and disorder, composite fermions exhibit integer quantum Hall effect.&lt;ref name=Jaincf/&gt; The integer fillings of composite fermions, &lt;math&gt;\nu^*=n&lt;/math&gt;, correspond to the electrons fillings

:&lt;math&gt; \nu=\frac{n}{2pn\pm 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Combined with

:&lt;math&gt; \nu=1-\frac{n}{2pn\pm 1},&lt;/math&gt;

which are obtained by attaching vortices to holes in the lowest Landau level, these constitute the prominently observed sequences of fractions. Examples are

:&lt;math&gt;{n\over 2n+1}={1\over 3},\, {2\over 5},\, {3\over 7},\, {4\over 9},\,{5\over 11},\cdots &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{n\over 2n-1}={2\over 3},\, {3\over 5},\, {4\over 7},\, {5\over 9},\,{6\over 11},\cdots &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{n\over 4n+1}={1\over 5},\, {2\over 9},\, {3\over 13},\, {4\over 17},\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

The [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] of electrons is thus explained as the integer quantum Hall effect of composite fermions.&lt;ref name=Jaincf/&gt;  It results in fractionally quantized Hall plateaus at

:&lt;math&gt; R_H={h\over \nu e^2},  &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\nu &lt;/math&gt;  given by above quantized values. These sequences terminate at the composite fermion Fermi sea. Note that the fractions have odd denominators, which follows from the even vorticity of composite fermions.

=== Fractional quantum Hall effect ===

The above sequences account for most, but not all, observed fractions. Other fractions have been observed, which arise from a weak residual interaction between composite fermions, and are thus more delicate.&lt;ref name =cffqhe&gt;{{cite journal |title= Fractional quantum Hall effect of composite fermions |author1=W.

For example, the fractional quantum Hall effect of composite fermions at &lt;math&gt;\nu^*=4/3&lt;/math&gt; produces the fraction 4/11, which does not belong to the primary sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C.-C.

=== Superconductivity ===

An even denominator fraction, &lt;math&gt;\nu=5/2,&lt;/math&gt; has been observed.&lt;ref name=willetteven&gt;{{cite journal |title=Observation of an even-denominator quantum number in the fractional quantum Hall effect |author1=R.

=== Spin ===

At high magnetic fields the spin of composite fermions is frozen, but it is observable at relatively low magnetic fields. The fan diagram of the composite fermion Landau levels has been determined by transport, and shows both spin-up and spin-down composite fermion Landau levels.&lt;ref name=cfspin&gt;{{cite journal

=== Effective magnetic field ===

The effective magnetic field of composite fermions has been confirmed by the similarity of the fractional and the integer quantum Hall effects, observation of Fermi sea at half filled Landau level, and measurements of the cyclotron radius.

=== Mass ===

The mass of composite fermions has been determined from the measurements of: the effective cyclotron energy of composite fermions;&lt;ref name=cfmass&gt;{{cite journal

(It is unrelated to the electron band mass in GaAs, which is 0.07 of the electron mass in vacuum.)

== Theoretical formulations ==

Much of the experimental phenomenology can be understood from the qualitative picture of composite fermions in an effective magnetic field.  In addition, composite fermions also lead to a detailed and accurate microscopic theory of this quantum liquid. Two approaches have proved useful.

=== Trial wave functions ===

The following trial wave functions&lt;ref name=Jaincf/&gt; embody the composite fermion physics:

&lt;math&gt; \Psi^{\rm FQHE}_{\nu}=P\;\; \Psi^{\rm IQHE}_{\nu^*} \prod_{1\leq j&lt;k\leq N}(z_j-z_k)^{2p}  &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\Psi^{\rm FQHE}_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the wave function of interacting electrons at filling factor &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\Psi^{\rm IQHE}_{\nu^*}&lt;/math&gt; is the wave function for weakly interacting electrons at &lt;math&gt;\nu^*&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of electrons or composite fermions; &lt;math&gt;z_j=x_j+iy_j&lt;/math&gt; is the coordinate of the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th particle; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is an operator that projects the wave function into the lowest Landau level. This provides an explicit mapping between the integer and the fractional quantum Hall effects. Multiplication by &lt;math&gt;\prod_{j&lt;k=1}^N(z_j-z_k)^{2p}  &lt;/math&gt; attaches &lt;math&gt;2p&lt;/math&gt; vortices to each electron to convert it into a composite fermion. The right hand side is thus interpreted as describing composite fermions at filling factor &lt;math&gt;\nu^*&lt;/math&gt;.  The above mapping gives wave functions for both the ground and excited states of the fractional quantum Hall states in terms of the corresponding known wave functions for the integral quantum Hall states. The latter do not contain any adjustable parameters for &lt;math&gt;\nu^*=n&lt;/math&gt;, so the FQHE wave functions do not contain any adjustable parameters at &lt;math&gt;\nu=n/(2pn\pm 1) &lt;/math&gt;.

Comparisons with exact results show that these wave functions are quantitatively accurate. They can be used to compute a number of measurable quantities, such as the excitation gaps and exciton dispersions, the phase diagram of composite fermions with spin, the composite fermion mass, etc. For &lt;math&gt;\nu^*=1&lt;/math&gt; they reduce to the [[Laughlin wavefunction]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Anomalous Quantum Hall Effect: An Incompressible Quantum Fluid with Fractionally Charged Excitations |author=R.B. Laughlin |year=1983 |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=50 |issue=18 |page=1395 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.50.1395|bibcode = 1983PhRvL..50.1395L }}&lt;/ref&gt; at fillings &lt;math&gt;\nu=1/(2p+1)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Chern–Simons field theory ===

Another formulation of the composite fermion physics is through a Chern–Simons field theory, wherein flux quanta are attached to electrons by a singular gauge transformation.&lt;ref name=HLR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fractional quantum Hall effect and Chern–Simons gauge theories |author1=A.

== Background and process ==
=== Cellular process ===
Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium is a two step process, reducing NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; then NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, though the reaction may begin with NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; directly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each step is mediated by a different [[enzyme]], the first step of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium is usually mediated by a [[periplasm]]ic [[nitrate reductase]]. The second step (respiratory NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; reduction to NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is mediated by [[cytochrome c nitrite reductase]], occurring at the periplasmic membrane surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon, J.

=== Denitrification ===
Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium is similar to the process of [[denitrification]], though NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is reduced farther to NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; rather than to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, transferring eight electrons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both denitrifiers and nitrate ammonifiers are competing for NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; in the environment. Despite the redox potential of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium being lower than [[denitrification]] and producing less [[Gibbs free energy]], energy yield of denitrification may not be efficiently conserved in its series of enzymatic reactions and nitrate ammonifiers may achieve higher growth rates and outcompete denitrifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strohm, T.

==Marine context ==

=== Marine microorganisms ===
As dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium is an [[anaerobic respiration]] process, marine [[microorganism]]s capable of performing DNRA are most commonly found in environments low in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as [[oxygen minimum zone]]s (OMZs) in the water column, or sediments with steep O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gradients.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamp|first=Anja|last2=Beer|first2=Dirk de|last3=Nitsch|first3=Jana L.|last4=Lavik|first4=Gaute|last5=Stief|first5=Peter|date=2011-04-05|title=Diatoms respire nitrate to survive dark and anoxic conditions|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/14/5649|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=108|issue=14|pages=5649–5654|doi=10.1073/pnas.1015744108|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3078364|pmid=21402908}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamp|first=Anja|last2=Stief|first2=Peter|last3=Knappe|first3=Jan|last4=Beer|first4=Dirk de|date=2013-12-02|title=Response of the Ubiquitous Pelagic Diatom ''Thalassiosira weissflogii'' to Darkness and Anoxia|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082605|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=12|pages=e82605|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0082605|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3846789|pmid=24312664}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The nitrogen cycle with the role of DNRA..png|thumb|The oceanic nitrogen cycle with the role of DNRA. Blue line represents the ocean surface, with the atmosphere above. Notice how NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; produced by DNRA can be taken up by biota and converted into organic nitrogen, while N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced by denitrification is removed from the system, and may only re-enter via [[nitrogen fixation]]. It should also be noted that organisms undertaking denitrification and DNRA compete for NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the balance of the two processes depends on the abiotic and biotic conditions of the ecosystem (see section ‘DNRA in the Marine Context’, subheading ‘Ecological Role’).  ]]
DNRA has been documented in [[prokaryote]]s inhabiting the upper layer of marine sediments. For example,[[Benthos|Benthic]] [[sulfur bacteria]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2017}} in genera such as ''[[Beggiatoa]]'' and ''[[Thioploca]]'' inhabit [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] sediments on continental shelves and obtain energy by oxidizing sulfide via DNRA. These bacteria are able to carry out DNRA using intracellular nitrate stored in vacuoles.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Preisler|first=André|last2=de Beer|first2=Dirk|last3=Lichtschlag|first3=Anna|last4=Lavik|first4=Gaute|last5=Boetius|first5=Antje|last6=Jørgensen|first6=Bo Barker|date=2007-06-28|title=Biological and chemical sulfide oxidation in a Beggiatoa inhabited marine sediment|url=http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v1/n4/full/ismej200750a.html|journal=The ISME Journal|language=en|volume=1|issue=4|pages=341–353|doi=10.1038/ismej.2007.50|issn=1751-7362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Otte|first=Sandra|last2=Kuenen|first2=J.

While dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium is more commonly associated with prokaryotes, recent research has found increasing evidence of DNRA in various [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] microorganisms. Of the known DNRA-capable fungal species, one is found in marine ecosystems; an isolate of [[Ascomycota|ascomycete]] ''[[Aspergillus terreus]]'' from an OMZ of the Arabian Sea has been found to be capable of performing DNRA under anoxic conditions.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stief|first=Peter|last2=Fuchs-Ocklenburg|first2=Silvia|last3=Kamp|first3=Anja|last4=Manohar|first4=Cathrine-Sumathi|last5=Houbraken|first5=Jos|last6=Boekhout|first6=Teun|last7=de Beer|first7=Dirk|last8=Stoeck|first8=Thorsten|date=2014-01-01|title=Dissimilatory nitrate reduction by Aspergillus terreus isolated from the seasonal oxygen minimum zone in the Arabian Sea|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-14-35|journal=BMC Microbiology|volume=14|pages=35|doi=10.1186/1471-2180-14-35|issn=1471-2180|pmc=3928326|pmid=24517718}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of DNRA has also been found in marine [[Foraminifera|foraminifers]].&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

More recently, it has been discovered that using intracellular nitrate stores, [[diatom]]s can carry out dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, likely for short-term survival or for entering resting stages, thereby allowing them to persist in dark and anoxic conditions.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamp|first=Anja|last2=Høgslund|first2=Signe|last3=Risgaard-Petersen|first3=Nils|last4=Stief|first4=Peter|date=2015-01-01|title=Nitrate Storage and Dissimilatory Nitrate Reduction by Eukaryotic Microbes|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01492/abstract|journal=Aquatic Microbiology|pages=1492|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.01492|pmc=4686598|pmid=26734001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their metabolism is probably not sustained by DNRA for long-term survival during resting stages, as these resting stages often can be much longer than their intracellular nitrate supply would last.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The use of DNRA by diatoms is a possible explanation for how they can survive buried in dark, anoxic sediment layers on the ocean floor, without being able to carry out [[photosynthesis]] or [[Cellular respiration|aerobic respiration]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Currently, DNRA is known to be carried out by the benthic diatom ''[[Amphora coffeaeformis]]'', as well as the pelagic diatom ''[[Thalassiosira weissflogii]]''.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; As diatoms are a significant source of oceanic [[primary production]], the ability for diatoms to perform DNRA has major implications on their ecological role, as well as their role in the marine [[nitrogen cycle]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Ecological role ===
Unlike [[denitrification]], which removes reactive nitrogen from the system, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium conserves nitrogen within the system. Since DNRA takes [[nitrate]] and converts it into [[ammonium]], it does not produce N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Consequently, DNRA recycles nitrogen rather than causing N-loss, which leads to more sustainable [[primary production]] and [[nitrification]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Within an ecosystem, denitrification and DNRA can occur simultaneously. Usually DNRA is about 15% of the total nitrate reduction rate, which includes both DNRA and denitrification.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the relative importance of each process is influenced by environmental variables. For example, DNRA is found to be three to seven times higher in sediments under fish cages than nearby sediments due to the accumulation of [[organic carbon]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Conditions where dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium is favoured over denitrification in coastal ecosystems include the following:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Giblin, A.E., C.R. Tobias, B. Song, N. Weston, G.T. Banta, and V.H. Rivera-Monroy. 2013. The importance of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in the nitrogen cycle of coastal ecosystems. Oceanography, 26(3):124–131, Retrieved from  https://dx.doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2013.54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Marchant, H. K., Lavik, G., Holtappels, M., and Kuypers, M. M. M. (2014). The Fate of Nitrate in Intertidal Permeable Sediments. PLoS ONE, 9(8): e104517. {{doi|10.1371/}} journal.pone.0104517&lt;/ref&gt;
* High carbon loads and high sulfate reduction rates (e.g. areas of coastal or river runoff)
* Unvegetated subtidal sediment 
* Marshes with high temperatures and sulfate reduction rates (producing high levels of sulfides), e.g. mangroves 
* High organic matter deposition (e.g. aquacultures)
* Ecosystems where organic matter has a high [[Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio|C/N ratio]]
* High [[electron donor]] (organic carbon) to acceptor (nitrate) ratio
* High summer temperatures and low NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations

High sulfide concentration can inhibit the processes of nitrification and denitrification. Meanwhile, it can also enhance dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium since high sulfide concentration provides more electron donors.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;An, S. and Gardner, W. S. (2002). Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) as a nitrogen link, versus denitrification as a sink in a shallow estuary (Laguna Madre/Baffin Bay, Texas). MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES, 237: 41–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosystems where DNRA is dominant have less nitrogen loss, resulting in higher levels of preserved nitrogen in the system.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Within sediments, the total dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium rate is higher in spring and summer compared to autumn. Prokaryotes are the major contributors for DNRA during summer, while eukaryotes and prokaryotes contribute similarly to DNRA during spring and autumn.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Potential benefits of using dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium for individual organisms may include the following:&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Tiedje, J. M. (1988). Ecology of denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium. p. 179-244. In A. J. B. Zehnder (ed.), Environmental Microbiology of Anaerobes. John Wiley and Sons, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Detoxification]] of accumulated [[nitrite]]: if an [[enzyme]] uses nitrate as an [[electron acceptor]] and produces [[nitrite]], it can result in high levels of intracellular nitrite concentrations that can be toxic to the cell.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; DNRA does not store nitrite within the cell, reducing the level of toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;Tiso, M. and Schechter, A. N. (2015). Nitrate Reduction to Nitrite, Nitric Oxide and Ammonia by Gut Bacteria under Physiological Conditions. PLOS ONE. 10(3): e0119712. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0119712}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* DNRA produces an electron sink that can be used for NADH re-oxidation: the need for having an electron sink is more apparent when the environment is nitrate-limited.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Changes to f-ratio calculation ===
The balance of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and [[denitrification]] alters the accuracy of [[f-ratio]] calculations. The f-ratio is used to quantify the efficiency of the [[biological pump]], which reflects sequestering of carbon from the atmosphere to the deep sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ducklow, H. W., Steinberg, D. K. and Bueseler, K. O.|first=|year=2001|title=Upper ocean carbon export and the biological pump|url=|journal=Oceanography|volume=14|pages=50–58|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The f-ratio is calculated using estimates of 'new production' (primary productivity stimulated by nutrients entering the [[photic]] zone from outside the photic zone, for example from the deep ocean) and 'regenerated production' (primary productivity stimulated by nutrients already in the photic zone, released by [[remineralisation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/courses/OCN626/2010/N%20cycle%20lecture%20%5BCompatibility%20Mode%5D.pdf|title=Determining the f-ratio|last=|first=|date=21 March 2017|website=University of Hawaii|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculations of the f-ratio use the nitrogen species stimulating primary productivity as a proxy for the type of production occurring; productivity stimulated by NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; rather than NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is 'regenerated production'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=W. G. Harrison, Platt, T. and Marlon, L. R.|first=|year=1987|title=f-Ratio and its relationship to ambient nitrate concentration in coastal waters|url=|journal=Journal of Plankton Research|volume=9|pages=235–248|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNRA also produces NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in addition to remineralisation) but from organic matter which has been exported from the photic zone; this may be subsequently reintroduced by mixing or [[upwelling]] of deeper water back to the surface, thereby, stimulating [[primary productivity]]; thus, in areas where high amounts of DNRA is occurring, f-ratio calculations will not be accurate.

'''Electrocar, Electrocart''' is an [[electric vehicle]], typically a small [[cart]] with an electrical driving gear and a [[storage battery]].

In the United Kingdom, similar small electric vehicles were known as electric drays.

A typical [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]/[[Belarus]]ian electrocar EC-1.00 (and also its modifications, including EC-1.00-1 designed and manufactured ({{As of|2007|lc=on}}) at [[Mogilev]] Automobile Plant ([[MoAZ]]) is frequently used in factories for the transportation of not so heavy loads, because it does not emit harmful [[exhaust gas|exhaust]].

In [[mathematics]], the '''Euclidean distance''' or '''Euclidean metric''' is the "ordinary" [[straight line|straight-line]] [[distance]] between two points in [[Euclidean space]]. With this distance, Euclidean space becomes a [[metric space]]. The associated [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] is called the '''[[Norm (mathematics)#Euclidean norm|Euclidean norm]].''' Older literature refers to the [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] as the '''Pythagorean metric'''. A [[generalized]] term for the Euclidean norm is the '''[[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; norm]]''' or L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; distance.

==Definition==
The '''Euclidean distance''' between points '''p''' and '''q''' is the length of the [[line segment]] connecting them (&lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbf{p}\mathbf{q}}&lt;/math&gt;).

In [[Cartesian coordinates]], if '''p'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''q'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) are two points in [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n''-space]], then the distance (d) from '''p''' to '''q''', or from '''q''' to '''p''' is given by the [[Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean formula]]:&lt;ref name=Anton&gt;{{citation|pages=170-171|first=Howard|last=Anton|title=Elementary Linear Algebra|edition=7th|year=1994|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-58742-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}d(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = d(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}) &amp; = \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2 + (q_2-p_2)^2 + \cdots + (q_n-p_n)^2} \\[8pt]
&amp; = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (q_i-p_i)^2}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

The position of a point in a Euclidean ''n''-space is a [[Euclidean vector]]. So, '''p''' and '''q''' may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The '''[[Euclidean norm]]''', or '''Euclidean length''', or '''magnitude''' of a vector measures the length of the vector:&lt;ref name=Anton /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \left\| \mathbf{p} \right\| = \sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2+\cdots +p_n^2} = \sqrt{\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{p}} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where the last expression involves the [[dot product]].

Describing a vector as a directed line segment from the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] of the Euclidean space (vector tail), to a point in that space (vector tip), its length is actually the distance from its tail to its tip. The Euclidean norm of a vector is seen to be just the Euclidean distance between its tail and its tip.

The relationship between points '''p''' and '''q''' may involve a direction (for example, from '''p''' to '''q'''), so when it does, this relationship can itself be represented by a vector, given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p} = (q_1-p_1, q_2-p_2, \cdots, q_n-p_n).&lt;/math&gt;

In a two- or three-dimensional space (''n'' = 2, 3), this can be visually represented as an arrow from '''p''' to '''q'''. In any space it can be regarded as the position of '''q''' relative to '''p'''. It may also be called a [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] vector if '''p''' and '''q''' represent two positions of some moving point. 

The Euclidean distance between '''p''' and '''q''' is just the Euclidean length of this displacement vector:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \left\| \mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p} \right\| = \sqrt{(\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{p})\cdot(\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{p})} .&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

which is equivalent to equation 1, and also to:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\| \mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p} \right\| = \sqrt{ \left\| \mathbf{p} \right\|^2 + \left\| \mathbf{q} \right\| ^2 - 2 \mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{q}} .&lt;/math&gt;

===One dimension===
In the context of [[Euclidean geometry]], a metric is established in one dimension by fixing two [[Point (geometry)|points]] on a [[Line (geometry)|line]], and choosing one to be the [[Origin (geometry)|origin]]. The length of the [[line segment]] between these points defines the unit of distance and the direction from the origin to the second point is defined as the ''positive direction''. This line segment may be [[Translation (geometry)|translated]] along the line to build longer segments whose lengths correspond to multiples of the unit distance. In this manner [[real number]]s can be associated to points on the line (as the distance from the origin to the point) and these are the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] of the points on what may now be called the [[real line]]. As an alternate way to establish the metric, instead of choosing two points on the line, choose one point to be the origin, a unit of length and a direction along the line to call positive. The second point is then uniquely determined as the point on the line that is at a distance of one positive unit from the origin.

The distance between any two points on the real line is the [[absolute value]] of the numerical difference of their coordinates. It is common to identify the name of a point with its Cartesian coordinate. Thus if ''p'' and ''q'' are two points on the real line, then the distance between them is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(q-p)^2} = |q-p|.&lt;/math&gt;

In one dimension, there is a single homogeneous, translation-invariant [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] (in other words, a distance that is induced by a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]]), up to a scale factor of length, which is the Euclidean distance. In higher dimensions there are other possible norms.

===Two dimensions===
[[file:Euclidean distance 2d.svg|thumb|right|Euclidean distance in R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] 
In the [[Euclidean plane]], if '''p'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''q'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) then the distance is given by

:&lt;math&gt;d(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})=\sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2 + (q_2-p_2)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to the [[Pythagorean theorem]].

Alternatively, it follows from ({{EquationRef|2}}) that if the [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] of the point '''p''' are (''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and those of '''q''' are (''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then the distance between the points is

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2 r_1 r_2 \cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Three dimensions===
In three-dimensional Euclidean space, the distance  is
:&lt;math&gt;d(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = \sqrt{(p_1 - q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2+(p_3 - q_3)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===''n'' dimensions &lt;!-- This is a lower-case italicized "n" for a reason. --&gt;===
In general, for an ''n''-dimensional space, the distance is

:&lt;math&gt;d(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = \sqrt{(p_1- q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2+\cdots+(p_i - q_i)^2+\cdots+(p_n - q_n)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Squared Euclidean distance===
The standard Euclidean distance can be squared in order to place progressively greater weight on objects that are farther apart. In this case, the equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;d^2(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = (p_1 - q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2+\cdots+(p_i - q_i)^2+\cdots+(p_n - q_n)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Squared Euclidean distance is not a [[Metric_(mathematics)|metric]], as it does not satisfy the [[triangle inequality]]; however, it is frequently used in optimization problems in which distances only have to be compared.

It is also referred to as [[rational trigonometry#Quadrance|quadrance]] within the field of [[rational trigonometry]].

The '''Formula Sun Grand Prix''' (FSGP) is an annual [[solar car race|solar-car race]] that takes place on closed-loop race tracks. In the race, teams from colleges and universities throughout North America design, build, test, and race [[solar vehicle|solar-powered vehicles]].

Every two years the race serves as a qualifier for the [[American Solar Challenge]] road race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americansolarchallenge.org/about/formula-sun-grand-prix FSGP Info Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

FSGP 2017 took place between July 6 and 8 at [[Circuit of the Americas]] in [[Austin]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://americansolarchallenge.org/the-competition/ascfsgp-2017/ ASC/FSGP 2017 page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format and organization ==

===Rules===
* The race consists of three days of freely driving laps around the race track.
* The team with the most total laps driven wins.
* The total area of all solar cells and related reflectors, etc., must not exceed six-square meters.
* The solar array may be reoriented toward the sun for charging batteries for specified time periods before and after race hours.
* Strict specifications and engineering scrutiny process is provided for vehicle configuration, safety requirements, and other standards.
* Previous races have divided teams into "open" and "stock" classes based on levels of solar cell and battery technologies.

==History==
'''Formula Sun Grand Prix''' is governed by the [[Innovators Educational Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://americansolarchallenge.org/about/innovators-educational-foundation IEF Info Page]&lt;/ref&gt; and was started in summer 2000 at [[Heartland Park Topeka|Heartland Park]] race track in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Kansas]], in conjunction with a [[solar bike|solar-bike]] race.

It has served as a qualifying race for the biennial [[American Solar Challenge]] road race.

The race was held there every year through 2005 until the 2007 American Solar Challenge was canceled due to funding issues. It resumed in 2009 and has been held every year since then at a few different venues.

===2000===
The inaugural race was held at [[Heartland Park Topeka]] race track in [[Topeka]], [[Kansas]]. It was won by [[Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology]]'s ''Solar Phantom V''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rose-hulman.edu/SolarPhantom/fsgp2000.html RHIT history]&lt;/ref&gt; The stock class was won by the [[Missouri University of Science and Technology|University of Missouri-Rolla]]'s ''Solar Miner II''.

'''Friends of the Earth (HK) Charity Limited (FoE (HK))''' is  a [[Hong Kong]] based [[environmental organisation]] founded in 1983. Commonly known as Friends of the Earth (HK)or FoE (HK), it has  a membership of more than 12,000 individuals.&lt;ref name=Members /&gt;

As FoE (HK) receives no regular funding from governments, it relies on donations from the public and volunteer work.&lt;ref name=Members /&gt;

The organisation is active in environmental campaigns and environmental education.  It is not a member group of [[Friends of the Earth International]], owing to disagreements over the latter's policy against commercial sponsorship.

==Leadership==
The former Director, Mrs [[Mei Ng]], achieved recognition of her work with the organisation when she was elected to the [[United Nations]] Global 500 Roll of Honor on [[World Environment Day]] in 2000.

==Work in mainland China==
Since 1992, FoE (HK)'s China team has been networking in [[mainland China]] with  women's groups, students, academics, NGOs, cadres and governmental agencies. Hundreds of people in China are enlisted as advisors and honorary members. FoE (HK) has also given an "Earth Award" to people dedicated to environmental issues.&lt;ref name=Members /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="948">'''Gonçalo alves''' is a hardwood (from the [[Portuguese (language)|Portuguese]] name, '''Gonçalo Alves'''). It is sometimes referred to as tigerwood — a name that underscore the wood's often dramatic, contrasting color scheme, that some compare to [[rosewood]].

While the sapwood is very light in color, the heartwood is a sombre brown, with dark streaks that give it a unique look. The wood's color deepens with exposure and age and even the plainer-looking wood has a natural luster.

Two [[species]] are usually listed as sources for gonçalo alves: ''[[Astronium fraxinifolium]]'' and ''[[Astronium graveolens]]'', although other species in the genus may yield similar wood; the amount of striping that is present may vary.  All trees grow in [[neotropical]] forests; [[Brazil]] is a major exporter of these woods.

They are proprietary materials owned by the Graphite Metallizing Corp.

==Construction==
When the metal is impregnated in the graphite it forms long continuous filaments. These are what gives the material its [[ductility]], [[strength of materials|strength]], and [[heat sink|heat dissipation]] properties.&lt;ref name="bloch"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bloch | first = Heinz P. | last2 = Geitner  | first2 = Fred K. | title = Major process equipment maintenance and repair | page = 110 | publisher = Gulf Professional Publishing | year = 1997 | edition = 2nd | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IpBaybUJ5T8C&amp;pg=PA110 | isbn = 978-0-88415-663-5 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Graphalloy is used in applications where high and low temperatures are encountered, [[grease (lubricant)|grease]] or [[oil]] is not feasible, expulsion of wear particles is prohibited, or in dusty, submerged, or [[corrosion|corrosive]] environments. It is non-corrosive in [[gasoline]], [[jet fuel]], [[solvent]]s, [[bleach]]es, [[Corrosive|caustics]], [[dye]]s, [[liquefied gas]]es, [[acid]]s, and many more chemicals. It is not used in highly [[abrasive]] applications. Common applications include [[pump]]s, bleaching and washing tanks, [[oven]]s, [[industrial dryer]]s, [[steam turbine]]s, [[kiln]]s, [[cryogenics]].&lt;ref name="bloch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tribomat"&gt;{{Citation |title = Typical applications|url = http://www.tribomat.com/html/typicalapp.htm|accessdate = 2010-04-07|archiveurl = |archivedate = |postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used as bearing in applications where [[electrical conduction]] is necessary. It is used in when high frequency current degrades [[ball bearing|ball]] or [[needle bearing]]s. Examples of applications include [[packaging and labeling|packaging machine]]s, [[radar]] joints, and [[welding]] equipment.&lt;ref name="tribomat"/&gt;

'''Heated hoses''' are  used in bonding technology, filling and dosing systems, [[medical technology]], chemical, [[pharmaceutical]] and [[food]] industry, [[extruder]] applications, and research &amp; development. The heated hoses are used wherever a liquid, viscous or melted medium has to be transported from one place to another, e.g. [[chocolate]], [[Fruit preserves|jelly]] or [[hotmelt]]. In most applications, the temperature of the medium needs to remain constant at a specified value irrespective of variations in ambient temperature.

Heated hoses are suitable for environments from -40°C to 80°C and can be used in [[explosion proof|explosion-proof]] zones 1/21 and 2/22, if required.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newtronic.dk/picture/upload/catalogue_heated_lines_WEX.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A heated hose consists of a flexible hose, through which the media is pumped. This hose determines the resistance against temperature and chemicals. A [[heating element]] is wrapped on the hose and then it is covered with insulation material. Possible insulation materials are [[Polyamid]], steel wire or [[silicone]]. The [[heating element]] contains a heat [[sensor]]. Fittings and fixtures can vary with the application.

Heated hose are generally specified by required inside diameter, working pressure, operating conditions, voltage, temperature sensor  and hose fitting.

Heated hoses are now available for use around the home and farm. Commonly used on farms to get water to livestock in northern climates during the winter.

A '''lithium-ion capacitor''' ('''LIC''') is a hybrid type of [[capacitor]] classified as a type of [[supercapacitor]]. Activated [[carbon]] is typically used as the [[cathode]]. The [[anode]] of the LIC consists of carbon material which is pre-doped with [[lithium]] ions. This pre-doping process lowers the potential of the anode and allows a relatively high output [[voltage]] compared with other supercapacitors.

==History==
In 1981, Dr. Yamabe of Kyoto University, in collaboration with Dr. Yata of Kanebo Co., created a material known as PAS (polyacenic semiconductive) by pyrolyzing phenolic resin at 400–700&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings Annual Meeting of the Physical Society of Japan (Yokohama) 31p-K-1, 1982, March&lt;/ref&gt; This amorphous carbonaceous material performs well as the electrode in high-energy-density rechargeable devices. Patents were filed in the early 1980s by Kanebo Co.,&lt;ref&gt;Japanese patent application No. 56-92626,1981&lt;/ref&gt; and efforts to commercialize [[PAS capacitor]]s and lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) began. The PAS capacitor was first used in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;International Conference on Science and Technology of Synthetic Metals 1986, Kyoto&lt;/ref&gt; and the LIC capacitor in 1991.

==Concept==
[[File:Supercapacitors-Short-Overview.png|thumb|right|300px|Hierarchical classification of supercapacitors and related types]]
A lithium-ion capacitor is a hybrid electrochemical energy storage device which combines the [[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] mechanism of a [[lithium-ion battery]] anode with the double-layer mechanism of the [[cathode]] of an electric double-layer capacitor ([[EDLC]]). The packaged energy density of an LIC is approximately 20&amp;nbsp;Wh/kg, roughly four times higher than an EDLC and five times lower than a lithium-ion battery. The power density, however, has been shown to match that of EDLCs, as it is able to completely discharge in seconds.&lt;ref name="refone"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468612001144 |title=Evaluation of lithium-ion capacitors assembled with pre-lithiated graphite anode and activated carbon cathode |date=20 March 2012 |access-date=2014-01-14 |doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2012.01.076 |volume=65 |journal=Electrochimica Acta |pages=280–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the negative electrode (cathode), for which [[activated carbon]] is often used, charges are stored in an [[Double-layer capacitance|electric double layer]] that develops at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte.

The positive electrode ([[anode]]) was originally made from [[lithium titanate oxide]], but is now more commonly made from [[graphite|graphitic carbon]] to maximize energy density. The graphitic electrode potential initially at -0.1&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|V]] versus SHE (standard hydrogen electrode) is lowered further to -2.8&amp;nbsp;V by intercalating lithium ions. This step is referred to as "doping" and often takes place in the device between the anode and a sacrificial lithium electrode. The pre-doping process is critical to the device functioning as it can significantly affect the development of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Doping the anode lowers the anode potential and leads to a higher output voltage of the capacitor. Typically, output voltages for LICs are in the range of 3.8–4.0&amp;nbsp;V but are limited to minimum allowed voltages of 1.8–2.2&amp;nbsp;V. If the voltage drops any lower than this lithium ions will deintercalate more rapidly than they can be restored during normal use. Like EDLCs, LIC voltages vary linearly adding to complications integrating them into systems which have power electronics that expect the more stable voltage of batteries. As a consequence, LICs have a high energy density, which varies with the square of the voltage. The capacitance of the anode is several orders of magnitude larger than that of the cathode. As a result, the change of the anode potential during charge and discharge is much smaller than the change in the cathode potential.

The electrolyte used in an LIC is a lithium-ion salt solution that can be combined with other organic components and is generally identical to that used in lithium-ion batteries.

A separator prevents direct electrical contact between anode and cathode.

==Properties==
Typical properties of an LIC are

* high capacitance compared to a capacitor, because of the large anode, though low capacity compared to a Li-ion cell
* high energy density compared to a capacitor(14&amp;nbsp;Wh/kg reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/01/fdk-to-begin-ma.html |date=4 January 2009 |title=FDK To Begin Mass Production of High-Capacity Li-Ion Capacitors |access-date=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;), though low energy density compared to a Li-ion cell
* high [[Electric power|power]] density
* high reliability
* [[operating temperature]]s ranging from &amp;minus;20&amp;nbsp;°C to 70&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jsrmicro.be/sites/default/files/attachments/ultimo_lithium_ion_capacitor_brochure_nv_0.pdf|title=ULTIMO Li-ion hybrid capacitor Spec Sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* low self-discharge (&lt;5% voltage drop at 25&amp;nbsp;°C over three months)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Comparison to other technologies==
[[File:Lithium Ion Capacitor Chart.png|thumb|250px|Ragone plot comparing LIC to other technologies]]

[[Battery (electricity)|Batteries]], [[EDLC]] and LICs each have different strengths and weaknesses, making them useful for different categories of applications.
LICs have higher power densities than batteries, and are safer than [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]] (LIBs), in which [[thermal runaway]] reactions may occur.
Compared to the electric double-layer capacitor ([[EDLC]]), the LIC has a higher output voltage. Although they have similar power densities, the [[energy density]] of an LIC is much higher than those of the others.

The [[Ragone plot]] in figure 1 shows that LICs combine the high energy of LIBs with the high power density of EDLCs.

Cycle life performance of LICs is much better than batteries and is similar to EDLCs.

==Applications==
Lithium-ion capacitors are quite suitable for applications which require a high energy density, high power densities and excellent durability. Since they combine high energy density with high power density, there is no need for additional electrical storage devices in various kinds of applications, resulting in reduced costs.

Potential applications for lithium-ion capacitors are, for example, in the fields of [[wind power]] generation systems, [[uninterruptible power source]] systems (UPS), [[voltage sag]] compensation, [[photovoltaic]] power generation, energy recovery systems in industrial machinery, and transportation systems.

The '''Ministry of Oil Industry''' ('''Minnefteprom'''; {{lang-ru|Министерство нефтяной промышленности СССР}}) was a [[government ministry]] in the [[Soviet Union]].

==History==
The Ministry of the Petroleum Industry was created by the 28 December 1948 [[ukase]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] USSR merging the Ministry of the Petroleum Industry of the Southern and Western Regions, the Ministry of the Petroleum Industry of the Eastern Regions, Glavgaztoppron (Main Administration of Synthetic Liquid Fuel and Gas) and Glavneftegazstroy (Main Administration for the Construction of the Petroleum and Gas Industry) under the [[Council of Ministers USSR]], and Glavneftesnab (Main Administration for the Supply of Petroleum Products to the National Economy) under [[Gossnab]] USSR (State Committee of the Council of Ministers USSR for Material and Technical Supply to the National Economy).&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

The Ministry of Petroleum Industry (People's Commissariat of Petroleum Industry prior to 15 March 1946) was established 12 October 1939 by ukase of the Presidium, Supreme Soviet USSR, and was subdivided on 4 March 1946 into the Ministry of the Petroleum Industry of the Southern ard Western Regions of the USSR and the Ministry of the Petroleum Industry of the Eastern Region of the USSR.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

Prior to 1939 it had been a part of the All-Union People's Commissariat of the Fuel Industry, established 24 January 1939 by ukase of the Presidium, Supreme Soviet USSR, as a result of the subdivision of the [[People's Commissariat of Heavy Industry]] USSR.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

==Organization==
The Ministry of the Petroleum Industry was an [[all-Union ministry]] which administered the petroleum extraction, petroleum refining, and gas industries, the production of liquid fuels, the construction of installations for the petroleum and gas industries, the construction of petroleum-drilling machinery, and the marketing of petroleum products.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

The Ministry of the Petroleum Industry was headed by a minister who directed the entire work of the Ministry of the Petroleum Industry and of the enterprises and organizations under its jurisdiction. The Minister of the Petroleum Industry issued, within the limits of his competence, orders and directives based on, and in execution of, existing laws, as well as of decrees and regulations of the Council of Ministers USSR, and he checked on their execution.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

The Minister of the Petroleum Industry appointed directors of main administrations, administrations, and divisions of the Ministry and of the enterprises and organizations under its jurisdiction; he organized enterprises and organizations in accordance with established procedures; he approved statutes on main administrations, administrations, and divisions of the Ministry as well as the statutes and charters of organizations and enterprises under the jurisdiction of the Ministry.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

A collegium was formed within the Ministry of the Petroleum Industry, consisting of the Minister (chairman), his deputies, and the supervisory personnel of the Ministry. The membership of the collegium was approved by the Council of Ministers USSR, upon recommendation of the Minister of the Petroleum Industry.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

The collegium of the Ministry of the Petroleum Industry, at its regular sessions, considered questions of practical supervision, of checking on the execution of decisions, and of selection of personnel, as well as the most important orders and directives of the Ministry; it hears the reports of the directors of main administrations, administrations, and divisions of the Ministry and of organizations and enterprises under its jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

The decisions of the collegium are carried out by orders of the Minister. The basic task, for the carrying out of which the Ministry of the Petroleum Industry is responsible, is to assure the development of the petroleum industry in accordance with plans approved by the USSR government, with the goal of completely satisfying the requirement of the rational economy for petroleum products and gas.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

This goal was to be achieved by the introduction of the most modern equipment, by mechanizing and automatizing production processes in the extraction and refining of petroleum and gas, by the construction of oil fields, refineries, gas plants, plants for the production of synthetic liquid fuels, pipelines and petroleum tanks by the development of petroleum machinery building, by the creation of permanent cadres of qualified workers, engineers, and technicians, by increasing labor productivity, and by improving the quality of production and reducing its costs. The Ministry of the Petroleum Industry prepares production plans (prospective, yearly, quarterly), plans for capital construction, marketing, and railroad and water transport, as well as for balancing income and expenditures.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

It submitted these plans for ratification by the Council of Ministers USSR in accordance with established procedure, and it takes measures toward the fulfillment of plans that have been ratified.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

==Role==
The Ministry of the Petroleum Industry organized the prospecting and surveying of new petroleum, gas, and [[ozocerite]] deposits by geological, geophysical, and geochemical surveying methods. It takes measures to increase labor productivity, to improve the quality of production, and to reduce the cost of production and construction. It exercises technical and production supervision over enterprises of the Ministry, and introduces the most modern equipment, technical improvements and inventions, mechanization and automatization of production processes,and established norms for the consumption of materials, power and fuel.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; 

It drafts plans for production standards in branches of industry under the jurisdiction of the Ministry- and submits them for ratification according to established procedure. The Ministry directs the construction of enterprises and installations of the petroleum industry and, in accordance with established procedure, ratifies planned quotas, technical plans, and estimates for capital construction. It organizes and supervises the material and technical supply of enterprises, organizations, and installations. It supervises the operations of enterprises which produce industrial and construction materials required by branches of industry under the jurisdiction of the Ministry.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

The Ministry handled the sales of petroleum products produced by enterprises of the Ministry of the Petroleum Industry through a system of administrations and petroleum bases of Glavneftesbyt (Main Administration of Petroleum Sales).&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

It selected the personnel of the Ministry, takes measures to provide enterprises and construction projects of the Ministry with personnel and to utilize them properly, at the same time providing for their living conditions.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

It draws up regulations on the wages of workers, engineers, technicians, and employees of the enterprises, submits them for ratification by the Council of Ministers USSR, in accordance with established procedure, and supervises their application. It determines technical norms and the revision of output norms (except for the basic revision of norms carried out with the permission of the government), and checks on their fulfillment.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

It supervised the observance of labor legislation and rules for accident prevention. It directs the conclusion of collective contracts and checks on their fulfillment. The Ministry directs socialist competition to develop the creative initiative of workers, engineers, and technicians, to increase labor productivity further, to fulfill production plans ahead of schedule, to improve the quality of production, to increase profits of the enterprises, and to acquire above-plan accumulations.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

It financed the enterprises and organizations of the Ministry in accordance with established procedure, supervises their financial activity, and takes measures to speed up the turnover of working capital and to increase the profits of the enterprises. It supervises the organization and system of accounting, approves balances and reports of main administrations and organizations under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry, and draws up periodic and yearly accounting records for all types of industrial and administrative activity of the Ministry.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

It administers scientific research institutes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, planning organizations, and educational establishments and directs the training of workers in the mass professions. It directs the activity of administrations and divisions of labor supply and subsidiary economies.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

It takes measures for the protection of state socialist, property in enterprises, establishments, and organizations under the Ministry. It publishes literature on the technology, economics, and organization of the petroleum and gas industries. The structure of the Ministry of the Petroleum Industry is determined by the Council of Ministers USSR to utilize to the best advantage outstanding experiences of directors, ordinary workers, and Stakhanovites, the Ministry of the Petroleum Industry, its chain administrations associations, trusts and enterprises summon meetings at which reports are heard and discussed dealing with the most important party and government decisions as well as administrative directives of the Ministry. To develop criticism and self-criticism, questions on the activity of production and management are also discussed.&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Organization Of The Ministry of Oil Industry USSR|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00809A000700040140-0.pdf|publisher=CIA|accessdate=18 November 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nigerian Gas Association''' is the [[professional body]] responsible for the promotion and protection of the interests of the gas industry in [[Nigeria]].

Formed in 1999, the NGA's initial membership came from the primary gas production and utilization companies in Nigeria. The earliest members include the [[Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation]] (NNPC), the [[Shell Nigeria|Shell Petroleum Development Company]] (SPDC), the [[Nigeria LNG|Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Limited]] (NLNG), [[Chevron Nigeria|Chevron Nigeria Limited]], the Nigerian Gas Company (NGC), Elf Petroleum, [[Mobil Producing Nigeria]], the [[Agip|Nigerian Agip Oil Company]] (NAOC) and Conoco Energy Nigeria Limited.

The NGA has since grown to encompass the entire gamut of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and operators in the Nigerian gas industry – from gas producers, to transmitters, gas industry [[service provider]]s, students, members of the academia and government. The association presently has over 40 corporate members, 800 individual professional industry members, and more than 100 [[student]] members. The NGA is also a full chartered member of the International Gas Union (IGU), representing Nigeria on the Council of the global gas body.

== Aims and objectives ==
The aims of the Nigerian Gas Association include:
# Providing enlightenment to [[gas]] industry players and the general public on various developments in the Nigerian and global gas business.
# Engaging the Nigerian [[government]] and other key industry stakeholders with a view to creating policy and laws that enhance the growth and development of the Nigerian gas industry.
# Providing an avenue for unique, non-biased intervention on issues concerning the Nigerian gas industry.
# Creating [[Business networking|networking]] opportunities for individuals and organizations involved in the gas business, enabling them to create better value for themselves.

== Organization ==
The Nigerian Gas Association (NGA) is run by a council of elected officers who serve for a single term of two years. The Association’s elections usually hold just before the commencement of its [[Annual General Meeting]] (AGM). The Association also has a functional [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] that is staffed by competent administrative personnel to provide members and non-members with information and other support activities as required.

The Nigerian Gas Association's Council comprises the following officers:
# The President
# The First Vice President
# The Second Vice President
# The General Secretary
# The Assistant General Secretary
# The Legal Adviser
# The Publicity Secretary

== Events and activities ==
The Nigerian Gas Association usually organizes events and activities through which it drives to achieve its [[Political agenda|agenda]]-setting and industry engagement activities. Some of these events include:

===Quarterly Business Fora===
Business leaders and other prespected parties in the Nigerian gas business/industry are usually invited to the NGA Business Fora, where they speak and share their thoughts on agreed themes. The quarterly fora are free to all NGA members and serve as a pint for the gathering of the latest thoughts on the Nigerian gas industry.

===Conference and exhibition===
Held every two years, the NGA Conference and Exhibition serve as the highlights of the NGA's calendar. The events are usually attended by experts, members of the [[academia]] from within and outside Nigeria. The theme for the [[Academic conference|conference]] is set from the end of the previous conference, and papers are delivered by subject-matter experts. The event is also characterised by syndicate sessions and an [[exhibition]], where all gas industry players exhibit their products, services and projects to attendees.

===Training series===
To be launched in June 2010, The NGA Training Series are a set of training programmes organized by the NGA to address certain skill and [[Competence (human resources)|competency]] gaps identified in the Nigerian gas industry. The training programmes will be contextualised to fit and meet with the requirements of the Nigerian market, and will prosecuted by both professional experts with real industry experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201004191737.html|title=NGA Hails Implementation Efforts of Gas Master Plan|first=Daniel|last=Alfred|date=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patch cuts''' are logging cuts too small to be considered [[clearcutting|clearcut]]s, and are instead considered a form of [[selection cut]]. A typical patch cut might be 2-3 tree lengths. Below a certain size, seedling regeneration advantage shifts from the [[shade tolerance|shade intolerant]] species favored in clearcuts to the shade tolerant species favored by [[Selection cutting|selection harvests]].

An areas of patch cuts of different shapes were tried in the Northern hemisphere to see where shade tolerant and shade intolerant species might regenerate. It was found in small patches (1/10 acre) N. 44° that there was a limited solar exposure of only a few hours (3-4) and this would lead to strongly shade tolerant and moderately shade tolerant trees dominating over time. Yet at slightly larger (1/2 acre) patches much more sunlight for longer was reaching the forest floor. This would warm the floor more, increase nutrient release and thus more light demanding species could grow faster and might then reach maturity in the stand.&lt;ref&gt;Patterns of light and shade in clearcut openings of two shapes and sizes, Marquis D.A. US Forestry Service Research Report NE-39 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as light other factors to be considered are wind to avoid [[windthrow]], [[forest pathology|pathogens]] and [[wild fire|fire risk]]. Positive benefits can also be gained if patches keep horizontal biodiversity in a forest stand and for an owner with not so much forest this may be useful for keeping [[non-timber forest product]]s in usable amounts.

Patch cuts can have less visual impact than clearcuts, and can mimic some [[Forest dynamics|stand disturbance]] processes. Patch cuts can also be simpler to implement than trying to selectively [[logging|log]] individual trees within a selection cut.

Patch cuts are distinct from the group selection method. A patch would pick several trees to be big enough to allow regeneration of a specific species, perhaps that has problems growing due to shade intolerance or another factor, as several together. Whereas a group would be only a few mature trees (3-5) and would not necessarily favor a shade intolerant species to establish into a group. In a patch the edge effect would be overcome but in a group most likely not.&lt;ref&gt;Silviculture: Concepts and Applications 2nd Edition by Ralph D. Nyland Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Patch cuts may be used in a hybrid system with the '''single tree selection cut''' method or the '''group tree selection cut method'''.

The '''Patterson power cell''' is an [[electrolysis]] device invented by chemist James A. Patterson,&lt;ref name="voodoo science"/&gt; which he said created 200 times more energy than it used,&lt;ref name=simon/&gt; and neutralize radioactivity without emitting any harmful radiation.&lt;ref name="voodoo science"/&gt; It is one of several cells that some observers classified as [[cold fusion]]; cells which were the subject of an intense scientific controversy in 1989, before being discredited in the eyes of mainstream science.&lt;ref name="voss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Bart (2002) ''Undead Science''; Park, Robert L. (2002) Voodoo Science&lt;/ref&gt;

The Patterson power cell is given little credence by scientists.&lt;ref name="voss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Bart (2002) ''Undead Science'', pp= 160–164; Park, Robert L. (2002) Voodoo Science, pp= 11–12, 114–119&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist [[Robert L. Park]] describes the device as [[fringe science]] in his book ''[[Voodoo Science]]''.&lt;ref name="voodoo science"/&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Patterson Power Cell.png|thumb|Drawing of the cell.&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;{{US patent |5494559}} ''System for electrolysis.'' February 27, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The cell has a [[Non-conductor|non-conductive]] housing. The [[cathode]] is composed of thousands of sub-millimeter [[microsphere]]s (co-polymer beads), with a [[Electroplating#Strike|flash coat]] of copper and multiple layers of electrolytically deposited [[thin film]] (650 Angstrom) [[nickel]] and [[palladium]]. The beads are submerged in water with a [[lithium sulfate]]&lt;ref name=simon/&gt; (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) [[electrolyte]] solution. The cell uses lithium sulphate for electrolyte and nano nickel or nickel spheres. It splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. I refer you to the U.S. Patent.

==Company formed==
In 1995, Clean Energy Technologies Inc. was formed to produce and promote the power cell.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;Bishop, Jerry E., ''A bottle rekindles scientific debate about the possibility of cold fusion'', [[Wall Street Journal]], January 29, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Patterson died in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newenergytimes.com/v2/views/Group1/Patterson.shtml|title=New Energy Times – James "Doc" Patterson Remembrance|work=newenergytimes.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014221603/http://newenergytimes.com/v2/views/Group1/Patterson.shtml|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims and observations==

Patterson variously said it produced a hundred or two hundred times more power than it used.&lt;ref name=simon&gt;Simon, Bart (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dEJJqgw8pvwC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=ICCF-5+Patterson+demonstra#v=onepage&amp;q=hundred%20times%20more&amp;f=false ''Undead science: science studies and the afterlife of cold fusion'']. [[Rutgers University Press]], page 159. {{ISBN|0-8135-3154-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8135-3154-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, Robert L. (2002) Voodoo Science p. 11-12, claimed 200 times in 1996 ABC's ''Good Morning America''&lt;/ref&gt; Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (CETI) representatives promoting the device at the Power-Gen '95 Conference said that an input of 1&amp;nbsp;watt would generate more than 1,000&amp;nbsp;watts of [[excess heat]].&lt;ref name=wired2&gt;{{cite journal |first=Charles |last=Platt |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=November 1998 |volume=6 |number=11 |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.11/coldfusion_pr.html |title=What If Cold Fusion Is Real?}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supposedly happens as [[hydrogen]] or [[deuterium]] nuclei fuse together to produce heat through a form of [[LENR|low energy nuclear reaction]].&lt;ref name="voodoo science"&gt;[[Robert L. Park|Park, Robert L.]] ''[[Voodoo Science|Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud]]''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2002, p. 114–118. Retrieved December 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The byproducts of nuclear fusion, e.g. a [[tritium]] [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and a [[proton]] or an &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He nucleus and a [[neutron]], have not been detected in a reliable way, leading a vast majority of experts to think that no such fusion is taking place.&lt;ref name="voss"&gt;Voss, David. [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/1258 "Whatever happened to cold fusion?"],  ''[[Physics World]],'' March 1, 1999. Retrieved December 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is further claimed that if [[radioactive]] [[isotope]]s such as [[uranium]] are present, the cell enables the hydrogen nuclei to fuse with these isotopes, transforming them into stable [[Chemical element|elements]] and thus neutralizing the radioactivity; and this would be achieved without releasing any radiation to the environment and without expending any energy.&lt;ref name="voodoo science" /&gt; A televised demonstration on June 11, 1997, on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' was not conclusive because there was no measurement of the radioactivity of the beads after the test, thus it cannot be discarded that the beads had simply absorbed the uranium ions and become radioactive themselves.&lt;ref name="voodoo science" /&gt; In 2002, the neutralization of radioactive isotopes has only been achieved through intense neutron bombardment in a [[nuclear reactor]] or large scale high energy [[particle accelerator]], and at a large expense of energy.&lt;ref name="voodoo science" /&gt;

When asked about reliability in 1998, Gabe Collins, a chemical engineer at CETI, stated: "When they don't work, it's mostly due to contamination. If you get any sodium in the system it kills the reaction&amp;nbsp;– and since sodium is one of the more abundant elements, it's hard to keep it out."&lt;ref name=wired2 /&gt;

Patterson has carefully distanced himself from the work of Fleischmann and Pons and from the label of "cold fusion", due to the negative connotations associated to them since 1989.&lt;ref name="voss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bart Simon (2002) ''Undead Science'' pp. 160–164,  Park, Robert L. (2002) Voodoo Science p. 12, 115&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, this effort was unsuccessful, and not only did it inherit the label of [[pathological science]], but it managed to make cold fusion look a little more pathological in the public eye.&lt;ref&gt;Bart Simon (2002) ''Undead Science'' p. 163-164&lt;/ref&gt; Some cold fusion proponents view the cell as a confirmation of their work, while critics see it as "the fringe of the fringe of cold fusion research", since it attempts to commercialize cold fusion on top of making bad science.&lt;ref&gt;Bart Simon (2002) ''Undead Science'' p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[John R. Huizenga]], professor of nuclear chemistry at the University of Rochester, who was head of a government panel convened in 1989 to investigate the cold fusion claims of Fleischmann and Pons, and who wrote a book about the controversy, said "I would be willing to bet there's nothing to it", when asked about the Patterson Power Cell.&lt;ref name="voodoo science" /&gt;

In 2006, Hideo Kozima, professor emeritus of physics at [[Shizuoka University]], has suggested that the byproducts are consistent with cold fusion.&lt;ref&gt;Kozima, Hideo (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=kB0nS1i-tdgC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=The+science+of+the+cold+fusion+phenomenon&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Patterson&amp;f=false ''The Science of the Cold Fusion Phenomenon''].

==Replications==
[[George H. Miley]] is a professor of nuclear engineering and a [[cold fusion]] researcher who claims to have replicated the Patterson Power Cell. During the 2011 World Green Energy Symposium, Miley stated that his device continuously produces several hundred watts of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Xiaoling Yang, George H. Miley, Heinz Hora. [http://link.aip.org/link/?APCPCS/1103/450/1 "Condensed Matter Cluster Reactions in LENR Power Cells for a Radical New Type of Space Power Source"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714111519/http://link.aip.org/link/?APCPCS/1103/450/1 |date=July 14, 2012 }}. ''[[American Institute of Physics]] Conference Proceedings,'' March 16, 2009, vol. 1103, pp. 450–458. The conference was [http://www.worldgreenenergysymposium.us/newsroom.html "2011 World Green Energy Symposium"]. October 19–21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier results by Miley have not convinced mainstream researchers, who believe that they can be explained by contamination or by misinterpretation of data.&lt;ref name="voss"/&gt; &lt;!-- source is from 1999, fixed that --&gt;

On the television show ''[[Good Morning America]]'', Quintin Bowles, professor of mechanical engineering at the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City]], claimed in 1996 to have successfully replicated the Patterson power cell.&lt;ref name="GMA"&gt;{{cite video | people= | date=January 7, 1996 | url= | title=Good Morning America | medium=Television Show | location=United States | publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''[[Voodoo Science]]'', Bowles is quoted as having stated: "It works, we just don't know how it works".&lt;ref name="voodoo science"/&gt;

A replication has been attempted at Earthtech, using a CETI supplied kit. They were not able to replicate the excess heat. They looked for cold fusion products, but only found traces of contamination in the electrolyte.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthtech.org/experiments/rifex/rifex.pdf Search for Evidence of Nuclear Transmutations in the CETI RIFEX Kit]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Petrobras 36''''' ('''''P-36''''') was at the time the largest floating [[semi-submersible]] [[oil platform]] in the world prior to its sinking on 20 March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Petrobras P-36 | url=http://www.bluestarline.org/farstad/p36.html | work=Bluestarline | date= | accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was owned by [[Petrobras]], a semi-public [[Brazil]]ian [[Petroleum|oil]] company headquartered in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Investor Relations | title=Shareholders' Information | url=http://www2.petrobras.com.br/ri/ing/InformacoesAcionistas/ComposicaoCapitalSocial.asp | publisher=Petrobras | date= | accessdate=20 May 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530215456/http://www2.petrobras.com.br/ri/ing/InformacoesAcionistas/ComposicaoCapitalSocial.asp | archivedate=30 May 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the platform was US$350 million (currently US${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|350000000|2001|r=-6}}}}).{{Inflation-fn|US}}

The vessel was built at the [[Fincantieri]] shipyard in [[Genoa]], [[Italy]] in 1995 as a [[drilling rig]]. She was owned then by Società Armamento Navi Appoggio S.p.A.  The {{convert|33000|t|ST}} rig was converted by Davie Industry, Levis, [[Canada]] to the world's largest oil production platform.

''P-36'' was operating for Petrobras on the [[Roncador Oil Field]], {{convert|130|km|mi|-1}} off the [[Brazil]]ian coast, producing about {{convert|84000|oilbbl|m3}} of crude per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Petrobras P-36 | url=http://home.versatel.nl/the_sims/rig/p36.htm | work=Oil Rig Disasters | date=14 April 2008  | accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P-36 was replaced by FPSO-Brasil which is a leased vessel from SBM Offshore. The FPSO-Brasil started its lease contract with Petrobras in December 2002.

==Accident==
In the early hours of March 15, 2001 there were two explosions in the aft starboard column at or around the emergency drain tank. The first explosion was caused by an overpressure event, the second by ignition of leaking hydrocarbon vapor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Petrobras Platform P-36 Explosions, Brazil | url=http://www.mace.manchester.ac.uk/project/research/structures/strucfire/CaseStudy/HistoricFires/Other/petrobras.htm | work=Oil Rig Disasters | date=14 April 2008  | accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there were 175 people on the rig; 11 were killed. Following the explosions, the rig developed a 16° [[List (watercraft)|list]], sufficient to allow down-flooding from the submerged fairlead boxes.

[[Marine salvage]] teams tried over the weekend to save the platform by pumping [[nitrogen]] and [[compressed air]] into the tanks to expel the water, but they abandoned the rig after bad weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1233083.stm| title=Post mortem into rig disaster begins| date=21 March 2001| publisher=BBC| first=Tom| last=Gibb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform sank five days after the explosions (March 20), in {{convert|1200|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} of water with an estimated {{convert|1500|t|short ton}} of [[crude oil]] remaining on board.

[[Image:Polyhydroxyalkanoates.png|thumb|400px|right|Chemical structures of P3HB, PHV and their copolymer PHBV]]

'''Polyhydroxyalkanoates''' or '''PHAs''' are [[polyester]]s produced in nature by numerous microorganisms, including through [[bacteria]]l [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of [[sugar]] or [[lipid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Jingnan|last2=Tappel|first2=Ryan C.|last3=Nomura|first3=Christopher T.|date=2009-08-05|title=Mini-Review: Biosynthesis of Poly(hydroxyalkanoates)|journal=Polymer Reviews|volume=49|issue=3|pages=226–248|doi=10.1080/15583720903048243|issn=1558-3724}}&lt;/ref&gt; When produced by bacteria they serve as both a source of energy and as a carbon store. More than 150 different [[monomer]]s can be combined within this family to give materials with extremely different properties.&lt;ref name="doi-2002"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Doi |first1=Yoshiharu |last2=Steinbuchel |first2=Alexander |year=2002 |title=Biopolymers |location=Weinheim, Germany |publisher=Wiley-VCH |isbn=978-3-527-30225-3 }}{{page needed|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These plastics are biodegradable and are used in the production of [[bioplastics]].

They can be either [[thermoplastic]] or [[elastomer]]ic materials, with [[melting point]]s ranging from 40 to 180&amp;nbsp;°C.

The mechanical properties and [[biocompatibility]] of PHA can also be changed by blending, modifying the surface or combining PHA with other polymers, enzymes and inorganic materials, making it possible for a wider range of applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tissue.medicalengineer.co.uk/Polyhydroxyalkanoates+for+tissue+engineering.php |title=Polyhydroxyalkanoates for tissue engineering |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128234757/http://tissue.medicalengineer.co.uk/Polyhydroxyalkanoates+for+tissue+engineering.php |archivedate=January 28, 2007 |first1=Anne John |last1=Michael |date=September 12, 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosynthesis==
[[Image:Bacillus subtilis Gram.jpg|thumb|right|Certain strains of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' bacteria can be used to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates]]

To produce PHA, a culture of a micro-organism such as ''[[Cupriavidus necator]]'' is placed in a suitable medium and fed appropriate nutrients so that it multiplies rapidly. Once the population has reached a substantial level, the nutrient composition is changed to force the micro-organism to synthesize PHA. The yield of PHA obtained from the intracellular granule inclusions can be as high as 80% of the organism's dry weight.

The biosynthesis of PHA is usually caused by certain deficiency conditions (e.g. lack of macro elements such as phosphorus, nitrogen, trace elements, or lack of oxygen) and the excess supply of carbon sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Y. B.|last2=Lenz|first2=R. W.|date=2001|title=Polyesters from microorganisms|journal=Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology|volume=71|pages=51–79|issn=0724-6145|pmid=11217417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyesters are deposited in the form of highly refractive granules in the cells.  Depending upon the microorganism and the cultivation conditions, homo- or [[copolyester]]s with different hydroxyalkanic acids are generated. PHA granules are then recovered by disrupting the cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bej.2007.11.029 |title=Isolation and purification of bacterial poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) |journal=Biochemical Engineering Journal |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=15–27 |year=2008 |last1=Jacquel |first1=Nicolas |last2=Lo |first2=Chi-Wei |last3=Wei |first3=Yu-Hong |last4=Wu |first4=Ho-Shing |last5=Wang |first5=Shaw S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recombinant ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' str. pBE2C1 and ''Bacillus subtilis'' str. pBE2C1AB were used in production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and it was shown that they could use [[malt]] waste as carbon source for lower cost of PHA production.

PHA synthases are the key enzymes of PHA biosynthesis.  They use the coenzyme A - thioester of (r)-hydroxy fatty acids as substrates. The two classes of PHA synthases differ in the specific use of hydroxy fatty acids of short or medium chain length.

The resulting PHA is of the two types:

*Poly (HA SCL) from hydroxy fatty acids with short chain lengths including three to five carbon atoms are synthesized by numerous bacteria, including ''[[Cupriavidus necator]]'' and ''[[Alcaligenes latus]]'' ([[Polyhydroxybutyrate|PHB]]).
*Poly (HA MCL) from hydroxy fatty acids with medium chain lengths including six to 14 carbon atoms, can be made for example, by ''[[Pseudomonas putida]]''.

A few bacteria, including ''[[Aeromonas hydrophila]]'' and ''[[Thiococcus pfennigii]]'', synthesize copolyester from the above two types of hydroxy fatty acids, or at least possess enzymes that are capable of part of this synthesis.

Another even larger scale synthesis can be done with the help of soil organisms. For lack of nitrogen and phosphorus they produce a kilogram of PHA per three kilograms of sugar.

The simplest and most commonly occurring form of PHA is the fermentative production of [[Polyhydroxybutyrate|poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate]] (poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, P3HB), which consists of 1000 to 30000 hydroxy fatty acid monomers.

==Industrial production==

In the industrial production of PHA, the polyester is extracted and purified from the bacteria by optimizing the conditions of microbial fermentation of [[sugar]] or [[glucose]].

In the 1980s, [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] developed [[Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)|poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-''co''-3-hydroxyvalerate)]] obtained via fermentation that was named "Biopol". It was sold under the name "Biopol" and distributed in the U.S. by [[Monsanto]] and later [[Metabolix]].&lt;ref name="Rudnik2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ewa Rudnik|title=Compostable Polymer Materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrQwn8XzKlEC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=3 January 2008|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-045371-2|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As raw material for the fermentation, carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose can be used, but also vegetable oil or glycerine from biodiesel production. Researchers in industry are working on methods with which transgenic crops will be developed that express PHA synthesis routes from bacteria and so produce PHA as energy storage in their tissues.  Several companies are working to develop methods of producing PHA from waste water, including start-up Micromidas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Micromidas to test sludge-to-plastic tech |author=Martin Lamonica |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/micromidas-to-test-sludge-to-plastic-tech/ |publisher=[[CNET]] |date=May 27, 2010 |accessdate=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Veolia]] subsidiary Anoxkaldnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A New Way to Make Plastic |author=Seb Egerton-Read |url=http://circulatenews.org/2015/09/a-new-way-to-make-plastic/ |publisher=Circulate |date=September 9, 2015 |accessdate=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PHAs are processed mainly via injection molding, extrusion and extrusion bubbles into films and hollow bodies.

==Material properties==
PHA polymers are thermoplastic, can be processed on conventional processing equipment, and are, depending on their composition, ductile and more or less elastic.  They differ in their properties according to their chemical composition (homo-or copolyester, contained hydroxy fatty acids).

They are [[ultraviolet|UV]] stable, in contrast to other bioplastics from polymers such as [[polylactic acid]], partial ca. temperatures up to {{nowrap|180 °C}}, and show a low permeation of water. The [[crystallinity]] can lie in the range of a few to 70%. Processability, impact strength and flexibility improves with a higher percentage of [[valerate]] in the material. PHAs are soluble in halogenated solvents such [[chloroform]], [[dichloromethane]] or [[dichloroethane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/aic.11274 |title=Solubility of polyhydroxyalkanoates by experiment and thermodynamic correlations |journal=AIChE Journal |volume=53 |issue=10 |pages=2704–14 |year=2007 |last1=Jacquel |first1=Nicolas |last2=Lo |first2=Chi-Wei |last3=Wu |first3=Ho-Shing |last4=Wei |first4=Yu-Hong |last5=Wang |first5=Shaw S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PHB is similar in its material properties to polypropylene (PP), has a good resistance to moisture and aroma barrier properties. Polyhydroxybutyric acid synthesized from pure PHB is relatively brittle and stiff.  PHB copolymers, which may include other fatty acids such as beta-hydroxyvaleriate acid, may be elastic.

==Applications==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Due to its biodegradability and potential to create [[bioplastic]]s with novel properties, much interest exists to develop the use of PHA-based materials. PHA fits into the [[green economy]] as a means to create plastics from non-fossil fuel sources. Furthermore, active research is being carried out for the [[biotransformation]] "[[upcycling]]" of plastic waste (e.g., [[polyethylene terephthalate]] and [[polyurethane]]) into PHA using ''[[Pseudomonas putida]]'' bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.p4sb.eu/|title=Homepage - P4SB|website=www.p4sb.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A PHA copolymer called [[PHBV]] (poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)) is less stiff and tougher, and it may be used as packaging material.

In June 2005, a US company (Metabolix, Inc.) received the US [[Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award]] (small business category) for their development and commercialisation of a cost-effective method for manufacturing PHAs.

There are potential applications for PHA produced by micro-organisms&lt;ref name="doi-2002" /&gt; within the medical and pharmaceutical industries, primarily due to their biodegradability.

Fixation and orthopaedic applications have included [[Surgical suture|sutures]], suture fasteners, [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] repair devices, [[rivet]]s, tacks, staples, screws (including interference screws), bone plates and bone plating systems, surgical mesh, repair patches, slings, cardiovascular patches, orthopedic pins (including bone.lling augmentation material), [[adhesion barrier]]s, [[stent]]s, guided tissue repair/regeneration devices, articular [[cartilage]] repair devices, nerve guides, [[tendon]] repair devices, [[atrial septal defect]] repair devices, pericardial patches, bulking and filling agents, [[vein]] valves, [[bone marrow]] scaffolds, meniscus regeneration devices, [[ligament]] and tendon grafts, [[human eye|ocular]] cell implants, spinal fusion cages, skin substitutes, [[dural]] substitutes, bone graft substitutes, bone dowels, wound dressings, and [[hemostat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.04.036 |pmid=15946738 |title=The application of polyhydroxyalkanoates as tissue engineering materials |journal=Biomaterials |volume=26 |issue=33 |pages=6565–78 |year=2005 |last1=Chen |first1=Guo-Qiang |last2=Wu |first2=Qiong }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radiation exposure''' is a measure of the ionization of [[air]] due to [[ionizing radiation]] from [[photon]]s; that is, [[gamma ray]]s and [[X-ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt; ''Knoll'', p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as the [[electric charge]] freed by such radiation in a specified volume of air divided by the [[mass]] of that air. 

The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of exposure is the [[Coulomb (unit)|coulomb]] per [[kilogram]] (C/kg), which has largely replaced the [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] (R).&lt;ref&gt;''Holmes-Siedle and Adams'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; One roentgen equals {{val|0.000258|u=C|up=kg}}; an exposure of one coulomb per kilogram is equivalent to 3876 roentgens.

As a measure of [[radiation damage]] '''exposure''' has been superseded by the concept of [[absorbed dose]] which takes into account the absorption characteristic of the target material. 

==Exposure conversion to absorbed dose==
{{main|Absorbed dose}}
Dose is the measure of energy per unit mass deposited by ionizing radiation. For a given radiation field, the absorbed dose will depend on the type of matter which absorbs the radiation. For instance, for an exposure of 1 [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] by gamma rays with an energy of 1 [[MeV]], the dose in air will be 0.877 [[rad (unit)|rad]], the dose in [[water]] will be 0.975 rad, the dose in [[silicon]] will be 0.877 rad, and the dose in averaged [[tissue (biology)|human tissue]] will be 1 rad. A table giving the exposure to dose conversion for these four materials for a variety of gamma ray energies can be found in the reference.&lt;ref&gt;Carron, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposure rate constant==
The gamma ray field can be characterized by the exposure rate (in units of, for instance, [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] per hour). For a point source, the exposure rate will be linearly proportional to the source's [[radioactivity]] and inversely proportional to the square of the distance,&lt;ref&gt;Knoll, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

:F = Γ×α / r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

where ''F'' is the exposure rate, ''r'' is the distance, ''α'' is the source activity, and ''Γ'' is the exposure rate constant, which is dependent on the particular [[radionuclide]] used as the gamma ray source.

Below is a table of exposure rate constants for various radionuclides. They give the exposure rate in roentgens per hour for a given activity in [[curie (unit)|millicuries]] at a distance in [[centimeter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/dept/EHS/prod/researchlab/radlaser/RSDS.html Stanford University Environmental Health and Safety, radionuclide safety data sheets]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10097">A '''renewable portfolio standard''' ('''RPS''') is a [[regulation]] that requires the increased production of [[energy]] from [[renewable resource|renewable energy sources]], such as [[Wind energy|wind]], [[Solar power|solar]], [[biomass]], and [[Geothermal power|geothermal]]. Other common names for the same concept include '''Renewable Electricity Standard''' ('''RES''') at the United States federal level and '''Renewables Obligation''' in the [[UK]].

The RPS mechanism places an obligation on [[electricity supply]] companies to produce a specified fraction of their electricity from renewable energy sources. Certified renewable energy generators earn certificates for every [[Units of measurement|unit]] of electricity they produce and can sell these along with their electricity to supply companies. Supply companies then pass the certificates to some form of regulatory body to demonstrate their compliance with their regulatory obligations. RPS can rely on the private market for its implementation. In jurisdictions such as California, minimum RPS requirements are legislated. California Senate Bill 350 passed in October 2015 requires retail sellers and publicly owned utilities to procure 50 percent of their electricity from eligible renewable energy resources by 2030. RPS programs tend to allow more [[market price|price]] [[competition (economics)|competition]] between different types of renewable energy, but can be limited in competition through eligibility and multipliers for RPS programs. Those supporting the adoption of RPS mechanisms claim that market implementation will result in competition, efficiency, and innovation that will deliver renewable energy at the lowest possible cost, allowing renewable energy to compete with cheaper [[fossil fuel]] energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awea.org/policy/rpsbrief.html awea.org &gt;&gt; Policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202081631/http://www.awea.org/policy/rpsbrief.html |date=2007-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RPS-type mechanisms have been adopted in several countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Sweden]], [[Belgium]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/RPSReportFinal.pdf Race to the Top: The Expanding Role of U.S. State Renewable Portfolio Standards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913070544/http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/RPSReportFinal.pdf |date=2012-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chile]], as well as in 29 of 50 [[U.S. state]]s, and the [[District of Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Policy by country==

===Australia===
''Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000'' (Cth){{cn|date=December 2016}}

===China===
China adopted a renewable energy target in 2006 and modified it in 2009 to the following targets:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2010/07/renewable-energy-policy-update-for-china|title=Renewable Energy Policy Update For China|author=Martinot, Eric and Li Junfeng |publisher=RenewableEnergyWorld|date=2010-07-21|accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Renewable [[electricity]] – 500 [[Gigawatt|GW]] by 2020 (300 from hydro, 150 from wind, 30 from biomass, and 20 from solar PV)
* Renewable [[energy]] – 15% by 2020 (15% non-fossile-fuel, which includes nuclear)

===European Union===
The European Union passed the [[Directive on Electricity Production from Renewable Energy Sources]] in 2001 and expanded it in 2007 to the following EU-wide targets (although [[Member State of the European Union|member states]] are free to pass more aggressive targets):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/energy/eu-renewable-energy-policy-linksdossier-188269|title=EU renewable energy policy|author=|publisher=EurActiv|date=2010-11-09|accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/3560/eu-to-meet-renewable-energy-target|title=EU to meet renewable energy target|author=Austin, Anna|publisher=Biomass Power &amp; Thermal Magazine|date=2010-03-12|accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Renewable [[electricity]] – 33% by 2020
* Renewable [[energy]] – 20% by 2020

====Germany====

The [[German Renewable Energy Act]], since its adoption in 2000, is producing strong growth in renewable power capacity by encouraging private investors through guaranteed [[Feed-in tariff]]s.
Germany adopted targets more aggressive than EU mandated targets on September 2010:

* Renewable [[electricity]] – 35% by 2020 and 80% by 2050
* Renewable [[energy]] – 18% by 2020, 30% by 2030, and 60% by 2050&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbose|first1=Galen|journal=Energy Policy|date=September 2016|volume=96|page=645 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516303408

Based on the 1997 Act on the Promotion of New Energy Usage, 118 million KWh was targeted in 2012 (METI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?id=1892&amp;vm=04&amp;re=01|title=日本法令外国語訳データベースシステム – [法令本文表示] – 新エネルギー利用等の促進に関する特別措置法|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Korea===
The Republic of Korea adopted the ''Act on the Promotion of the Development, Use, and Diffusion of New and Renewable Energy'' since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/lsInfoP.do?lsiSeq=136967&amp;efYd=20130323#0000|title=국가법령정보센터|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The Renewables Obligation (RO)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Sustainability/Environment/RenewablObl/Pages/RenewablObl.aspx Ofgem and ROC] Ofgem: What is the Renewables Obligation&lt;/ref&gt; is designed to encourage generation of [[electricity]] from eligible [[Renewable energy in the United Kingdom|renewable sources in the United Kingdom]]. It was introduced in [[England and Wales]] and in a different form (the Renewables Obligation (Scotland)) in [[Scotland]] in April 2002 and in [[Northern Ireland]] in April 2005, replacing the [[Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation]] which operated from 1990.&lt;ref name=postnote164&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/pn164.pdf |title=Renewable Energy |date=October 2001 |id=postnote 164 |publisher=[[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology]] |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RO places an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers in the United Kingdom to source an increasing proportion of electricity from renewable sources, similar to a renewable portfolio standard. In 2010/11 it is 11.1% (4.0% in Northern Ireland). This figure was initially set at 3% for the period 2002/03 and under current political commitments will rise to 15.4% (6.3% in Northern Ireland) by the period 2015/16 and then it runs until 2037 (2033 in Northern Ireland). The extension of the scheme from 2027 to 2037 was declared on 1 April 2010 and is detailed in the [[United Kingdom National Renewable Energy Action Plan|National Renewable Energy Action Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/what%20we%20do/uk%20energy%20supply/energy%20mix/renewable%20energy/ored/25-nat-ren-energy-action-plan.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Since its introduction the RO has more than tripled the level of eligible renewable electricity generation (from 1.8%{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} of total UK supply to 7.0% in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/stats/publications/dukes/2329-statistical-press-release.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829125252/http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/stats/publications/dukes/2329-statistical-press-release.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===United States===
The [[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act]] is a law, passed in 1978 by the United States Congress as part of the [[National Energy Act]]. It was meant to promote{{clarify|date=January 2015}} greater use of renewable energy.

In 2009, the US Congress considered Federal level RPS requirements. The [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]] reported out of committee in July by the Senate Committee on Energy &amp; Natural Resources includes a Renewable Electricity Standard that called for 3% of U.S. electrical generation to come from non-hydro renewables by 2013, but the full Senate did not pass the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/07/house-and-senate-move-to-address-climate-and-energy-mixed-bag-for-clean-energy|title=House and Senate Move to Address Climate and Energy: Mixed Bag for Clean Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different state RPS programs issue a different number of Renewable Energy Credits depending on the generation technology; for example, solar generation counts for twice as much as other renewable sources in Michigan and Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mjbeckconsulting.com/publications Challenges of Playing Favorites: State &amp; Federal RPS Programs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015030407/http://mjbeckconsulting.com/publications |date=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory claims that RPS requirements were responsible for 60% of the total increase in American renewable electricity generation since the year 2000. However, the LBNL also reports that RPSs' role has been declining in recent years from 71% of the annual American renewables builds in the year 2013 to 46% just two years later, in 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rps.lbl.gov|title=Renewables Portfolio Standards Resources|website=rps.lbl.gov|language=en|accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roaring 40s''' is an electricity generator formed in 2005 as a joint venture between [[Hydro Tasmania]], [[Australia]] and Hong Kong-based [[China Light and Power|China Light &amp; Power (CLP)]]. Since the beginning in 2005, Roaring 40s has had 13 sites in operation or in planning in [[Australia]], [[India]], [[Hong Kong]] and mainland [[China]]. [[Cathedral Rocks Wind Farm, South Australia|Cathedral Rocks]], [[Woolnorth Wind Farm, Tasmania|Woolnorth]], Waterloo Wind Farm and [[Musselroe Wind Farm, Tasmania|Musselroe]] are four notable [[power plant]]s that the company owns. 

Roaring 40s partnership will be splitting in June 2011 with the projects being divided between the two original partners, CLP and Hydro Tasmania.

[[File:Paolo Monti - Serie fotografica (Venezia, 1969) - BEIC 6357461.jpg|thumb|Sandolo, detail. Photo by [[Paolo Monti]], 1969]]
The '''sandolo''' is a traditional, flat-bottomed [[Venice|Venetian]] [[watercraft rowing|rowing]] [[boat]] designed for the generally shallow waters of the [[Venetian Lagoon]]. The plural is '''sandoli'''.
==Description==
A sandolo is of a much simpler build than a [[gondola]] but also has a pointed, decorated metal nose. It is also lighter and smaller than a gondola,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Charles Davis, Garry Marvin, ''Venice, the tourist maze'' (2004), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; and can be recognized at a glance, as it always lacks the benches and high steel [[prow]] (called ''ferro'') which is seen on a gondola.&lt;ref&gt;George Goodchild The Lore of the Wanderer (2007 reprint), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Holmes Agnew, [[Walter Hilliard Bidwell]], ''Eclectic magazine: foreign literature'' vol. 36 (Leavitt, Throw and Co., 1882), p. 766: "The sandolo is a boat shaped like the gondola, but smaller and lighter, without benches, and without the high steel prow or ferro which distinguishes the gondola."&lt;/ref&gt; The sandolo, like the larger craft, is rowed while standing up.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothea Ritter, [[John Julius Norwich]], ''Venice in old photographs, 1841-1920'' (Laurence King, 1994), p. 65: "The sandolo, a small, typically Venetian boat, is rowed, like the gondola, while standing up..."&lt;/ref&gt; It can be fitted with a sail,&lt;ref&gt;Horatio F. Brown, ''[[Life on the Lagoons]]'' (2008 reprint), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; and also with an outboard motor.

In the past, the police used an extant variant of the sandolo called vipera, which differed in having no [[Stem (ship)|stem]], being sharply pointed at both ends and constructed so that it can be rowed from either end.&lt;ref&gt;Damien Simonis, ''Venice'' (2004), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Space in the sandolo is limited, with enough room for one [[Watercraft rowing|oarsman]], [[aft]], two passengers on the main seat, and two more passengers sitting on small stools towards the [[Bow (ship)|bow]].&lt;ref&gt;Ginnie Siena-Bivona, Mitchel Whitington, Dorothy McConachie, ''Ghost Stories from Around the World'' (2004), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional use of the sandolo is for [[recreation]] and racing, and it is considered one of the four principal types of boat used in and around Venice.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Wilson, ''The Woodenboat'' (2000), pp. 25, 52, 56&lt;/ref&gt; Rather less stable than a gondola, it has a rocking motion all of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Heaton Vorse, ''The breaking in of a yachtsman's wife'' (Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1908), p. 155: "Our sandolo darted off with its peculiar rocking motion".&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not often used for fishing, as such, the craft is used for collecting [[crab]]s and [[mussel]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Geographical magazine]]'', vol. 32 (1959), p. 66: "The journey from Venice to [[Chioggia]] takes about ninety minutes, with never a dull moment... always and ever the tiny sandolo boat busy about some crab- or mussel-bed."&lt;/ref&gt; while an early 20th-century writer noted that he had heard the sandolo called "the donkey cart of Venice".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Henry Wade, ''Primer [first-fifth] reader'', vol. 4 (Ginn &amp; company, 1907), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;
The boat has also been called "without doubt one of if not the most graceful of all Venetian craft". Less manoevrable but lighter than a gondola, it was in the past used especially by boys, artists, and women.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaretta M. Lovell]], ''Venice: the American view, 1860-1920'' (1984), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Gondola Days'' (1897), [[Francis Hopkinson Smith]] (1838–1915) stated that the sandolo was "the only boat of really modern design, and this is rarely used as a fishing-boat". He went on to describe it as "a shallow [[skiff]] [[Draft (hull)|drawing]] but a few inches of water, and with bow and [[stern]] sharp and very low", and considered that it was originally intended for greater speed in [[Rowing (sport)|boat racing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Hopkinson Smith]], Gondola Days'' (1897), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4LL4EQvNgPcC&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 99-100]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horatio Brown]] said in his ''[[Life on the Lagoons]]'' (1884), "The Venetians are not good boat-builders. The only boats they make successfully are gondolas and sandoli.&lt;ref&gt;Horatio F. Brown, ''[[Life on the Lagoons]]'' (1884), chapter 'Sails and Sailmaking', [https://books.google.com/books?id=5wyJw5vwYDUC&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt; In a later book he wrote, "The pleasantest way to go to [[Malamocco]] is to take a sandolo, if you can.&lt;ref&gt;Horatio Forbes Brown, ''In and around Venice'' (1905), pp. 175-177&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Robertson said of Venice in 1898, "Their streets are canals, their carriages are gondolas and sandolos..."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Robertson, ''The Bible of St. Mark, St. Mark's Church the Altar and Throne of Venice'' (1898), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5xrA5mB67RUC&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 80]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:AlmoraSeer.jpg|thumb|right|A standard ''seer'' from [[Almora]], [[India]].]]
A '''Seer''' (also '''sihr''') is a traditional unit of mass and volume used in large parts of [[Asia]] prior to the middle of the 20th century. It remains in use only in a few countries such as [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iran]], although in the latter it indicates a smaller unit of weight than the one used in India.

==India==
{{British Indian units of mass}}
In India, the seer (Government seer) was defined by the Standards of Weights and Measures Act (No. 89 of 1956, amended in 1960 and 1964) as being exactly equal to 1.25&amp;nbsp;kg (1.792&amp;nbsp;lb). However, there were many local variants of the seer in India.

| mass of 40 local rupees
|-
| [[Mumbai]] (formerly Bombay)
| 28&amp;nbsp;lb (10.45&amp;nbsp;kg) called the ''Old Seer''
|}

==Oman, Nepal and Pakistan==
In [[Aden]] ([[Oman]]), [[Nepal]], and [[Pakistan]] a seer was approximately 0.93310&amp;nbsp;kg (2.057&amp;nbsp;lb) derived from the Government seer of [[British Raj|British colonial]] days.

==Afghanistan==
In [[Afghanistan]], it was a unit of mass, approximately 7.066&amp;nbsp;kg (15.58&amp;nbsp;lb).

==Persia/Iran==
In Persia (and later [[Iran]]), it was and remains in two units. 
# The '''metric seer''' was 74.22&amp;nbsp;g (2.618&amp;nbsp;oz)
# The seer (''sihr'') was 160&amp;nbsp;g (5.64&amp;nbsp;oz)

The smaller weight is now part of the national weight system in Iran and is used on daily basis for small measures of delicate foodstuff and choice produce.

==Sri Lanka==
In [[Sri Lanka]], it was a measure of capacity, approximately 1.86&amp;nbsp;pint (1.024&amp;nbsp;litres)

The [[carbon footprint]] of [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s depends on the fuel and technology used for [[electricity generation]].]]
'''The long tailpipe''' is an argument stating that usage of [[electric vehicle]]s does not always result in fewer emissions (e.g. [[greenhouse gas]]es) compared to those from non-electric vehicles. While the argument acknowledges that [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s operating in [[all-electric mode]] have no greenhouse gas emissions from the onboard source of power, it claims that these emissions are shifted from the vehicle [[tailpipe]] to the location of the electrical generation plants. From the point of view of a [[Tank-to-wheel|well-to-wheel assessment]], the extent of the actual [[carbon footprint]] depends on the fuel and technology used for [[electricity generation]].

[[Plug-in electric vehicle]]s operating in [[all-electric mode]] do not emit [[greenhouse gases]] from the onboard source of power but emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. From the point of view of a [[Tank-to-wheel|well-to-wheel assessment]], the extent of the actual [[carbon footprint]] depends on the fuel and technology used for [[electricity generation]]. From the perspective of a full [[life cycle analysis]], the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as [[wind power|wind]], [[solar energy|solar]], [[hydroelectric]], or [[nuclear power]] for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion&gt;{{Cite book | last = Sperling, Daniel and Deborah Gordon | title = Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability |year =2009| pages=22–26 and 114–139|publisher =[[Oxford University Press]], New York| isbn=978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PEVs&gt;{{cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|editor=[[David B.

Because plug-in electric vehicles do not produce emissions at the point of operation are often perceived as being [[environmentally friendlier]] than vehicles driven through [[internal combustion]].  Assessing the validity of that perception is difficult due to the [[greenhouse gas]]es generated by the power plants that provide the electricity to charge the vehicles' batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analyzing effects from well to wheel to air (the long tailpipe)|url=http://greentransportation.info/analyzing-effects-from-well-to-wheel-to-air-the-long-tailpip|work=Green Transportation|accessdate=20 December 2012|date=27 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hickman|first=Leo|title=Are electric cars bad for the environment?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/05/electric-cars-emissions-bad-environment|accessdate=20 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[New York Times]] reported that a [[Nissan Leaf]] driving in [[Los Angeles]] would have the same environmental impact as a gasoline-powered car with {{convert|79|mpgUS|abbr=on}} compared to the same trip in Denver would only have the equivalent of {{convert|33|mpgUS|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=STENQUIST|first=PAUL|title=How Green Are Electric Cars?

==Carbon footprint in selected countries==
A study published in the UK in April 2013 assessed the carbon footprint of plug-in electric vehicles in 20 countries. As a baseline the analysis established that manufacturing emissions account for 70 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/km. The study found that in countries with coal-intensive generation, PEVs are no different from conventional petrol-powered vehicles. Among these countries are China, Indonesia, Australia, South Africa and India. A pure electric car in India generates emissions comparable to a {{convert|20|mpgUS|abbr=on}} petrol car. The country ranking was led by [[Paraguay]], where all electricity is produced from [[hydropower]], and [[Iceland]], where electricity production relies on [[renewable power]], mainly hydro and [[geothermal power]]. Resulting carbon emissions from an electric car in both countries are 70 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/km, which is equivalent to a {{convert|220|mpgUS|abbr=on}} petrol car, and correspond to manufacturing emissions. Next in the ranking are other countries with similar low carbon electricity generation, including Sweden (mostly hydro and nuclear power ), Brazil (mainly hydropower) and France (predominantly [[nuclear power]]). Countries ranking in the middle include Japan, Germany, the UK and the United States.&lt;ref name=Guardian022013&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/feb/07/india-green-country-electric-cars|title=India named least green country for electric cars |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2013-02-07|accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avem.fr/news?id=3964|title=Véhicules électriques et émissions de CO2 – de 70 à 370 g CO2/km selon les pays|language=French|trans-title=Electric Vehicles and CO2 emissions - 70 to 370 g CO2/km by country |author=Michaël Torregrossa|publisher= Association pour l'Avenir du Véhicule Electrique Méditerranéen (AVEM)|date=2013-03-21|accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ShadeOG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/electric-car-emissions#.UWMjH5xsYH4.email|title=Shades of Green: Electric Cars’ Carbon Emissions Around the Globe|author=Lindsay Wilson|publisher=Shrink That Footprint|date=February 2013|accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carbon footprint in the United States==
In the case of the United States, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS) conducted a study in 2012 to assess average greenhouse gas emissions resulting from charging plug-in car batteries from the perspective of the full life-cycle ([[well-to-wheel]] analysis) and according to fuel and technology used to generate electric power by region. The study used the [[Nissan Leaf]] all-electric car to establish the analysis baseline, and electric-utility emissions are based on EPA's 2007 estimates. The UCS study expressed the results in terms of [[miles per gallon]] instead of the conventional unit of grams of greenhouse gases or [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] emissions per year in order to make the results more friendly for consumers. The study found that in areas where electricity is generated from natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric or renewable sources, the potential of plug-in electric cars to reduce greenhouse emissions is significant. On the other hand, in regions where a high proportion of power is generated from coal, [[hybrid electric car]]s produce less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent emissions than plug-in electric cars, and the best fuel efficient gasoline-powered [[subcompact car]] produces slightly less emissions than a PEV. In the worst-case scenario, the study estimated that for a region where all energy is generated from coal, a plug-in electric car would emit greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to a gasoline car rated at a combined city/highway driving fuel economy of {{Convert|30|mpgUS|abbr=on}}. In contrast, in a region that is completely reliant on natural gas, the PEV would be equivalent to a gasoline-powered car rated at{{Convert|50|mpgUS|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=UCS2012EVs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_vehicles/electric-car-global-warming-emissions-report.pdf|title=State of Charge: Electric Vehicles' Global Warming Emissions and Fuel-Cost Savings across the United States|author=Don Anair and Amine Mahmassani|publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] |date=April 2012|accessdate=2012-04-16}} ''pp. 16-20''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTCO201&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/automobiles/how-green-are-electric-cars-depends-on-where-you-plug-in.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1&amp;pagewanted=all|title=How Green Are Electric Cars?

An analysis of EPA power plant data from 2016 showed improvement in mpg-equivalent ratings of electric cars for nearly all regions, with a national weighted average of 80 mpg for electric vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.ucsusa.org/dave-reichmuth/new-data-show-electric-vehicles-continue-to-get-cleaner|title=New Data Show Electric Vehicles Continue to Get Cleaner|date=2018-03-08|work=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regions with the highest ratings include upstate New York, New England, and California at over 100 mpg, while only Oahu, Wisconsin, and part of Illinois and Missouri are below 40 mpg, though still higher than nearly all gasoline cars. 

==Criticism==
The long tailpipe has been the target of criticism, ranging from claims that many estimates are methodologically flawed to estimates that state that electricity generation in the United States will become less carbon-intensive over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Dean|title=Holes in the Long Tailpipe|url=http://www.neohouston.com/2010/04/holes-in-the-long-tailpipe/|publisher=neoHOUSTON|accessdate=21 December 2012|date=5 Apr 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tesla Motors]] CEO [[Elon Musk]] published his own criticism of the long tailpipe.&lt;ref name=Tesla&gt;{{cite web|last=Musk|first=Elon|title=The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me)|url=http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me|work=Tesla Blog|publisher=Tesla Motors|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The extraction and refining of carbon based fuels and its distribution is in itself an energy intensive industry contributing to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. In 2007 U.S. refineries consumed 39353 million kWh, 70769 million lbs of steam and 697593 million cubic feet of Natural Gas. And the refining energy efficiency for gasoline is estimated to be, at best, 87.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wang|first=Michael|title=Estimation of Energy Efficiencies of U.S. Petroleum Refineries|url=https://greet.es.anl.gov/files/hl9mw9i7|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=Mar 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1058">In [[physics]], the term '''total pressure''' may indicate two different quantities, both having the dimensions of a [[pressure]]:
* In [[fluid dynamics]], ''total pressure'' (&lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;) refers to the sum of [[static pressure]] p, [[dynamic pressure]] q, and gravitational head, as expressed by [[Bernoulli's_principle#Incompressible_flow_equation|Bernoulli's principle]]:
:&lt;math&gt;p_0 = p + q + \rho g z\,&lt;/math&gt;
:where ρ is the density of the fluid, g is the local acceleration due to gravity, and z is the height above a datum.
:If the variation in height above the datum is zero, or so small it can be ignored, the above equation reduces to the following simplified form:
:&lt;math&gt;p_0 = p + q\,&lt;/math&gt; 
:Because this is the static pressure that occurs in locations where the fluid flow is entirely stopped (stagnated), this case is also called the [[stagnation pressure]].

* In a mixture of [[ideal gas]]es, ''total pressure'' refers to the sum of each gas' [[partial pressure]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6889">In [[organic chemistry]], the '''tropylium ion''' or '''cycloheptatrienyl cation''' is an [[aromatic]] species with a formula of [C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=molecule|file=M04002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name derives from the molecule [[tropine]] (itself named for the molecule [[atropine]]). Salts of the tropylium cation can be stable, even with nucleophiles of moderate strength e.g., [[tropylium tetrafluoroborate]] and tropylium bromide (''see below''). Its bromide and chloride salts&lt;ref&gt;A mixture of [C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and [C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[PCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] is produced by treatment of tropylidene with phosphorus pentachloride.&lt;/ref&gt; can be made from [[cycloheptatriene]] (tropylidene) and [[bromine]] or [[phosphorus pentachloride]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;''Tropylium tetrafluorate'' Organic Syntheses, Coll.

It is a regular [[heptagon]]al, planar, cyclic ion; as well, it has 6 π-electrons (4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2, where ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1), which fulfills [[Hückel's rule]] of aromaticity. It can coordinate as a [[ligand]] to [[metal]] [[atoms]].

The structure shown is a composite of seven [[resonance contributor]]s in which each carbon atom carries part of the positive charge.

In 1891 G. Merling obtained a water-soluble bromine containing compound from a reaction of [[cycloheptatriene]] and [[bromine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merling |first=G. |date=1891 |title=Ueber Tropin |journal=Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft |volume=24 |pages=3108–3126 |doi=10.1002/cber.189102402151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most hydrocarbyl bromides, this compound, later named tropylium bromide, is a water-soluble solid and is insoluble in hydrocarbons, chloroform, and ether.  It is purified by crystallization from hot ethanol.  Reaction with aqeuous silver nitrate immediately gave a precipitate of silver bromide.  The structure of tropylium bromide was deduced to be a salt, C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Br&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;, by [[William von Eggers Doering|Doering]] and Knox in 1954 by analysis of its infrared and ultraviolet spectra.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Cycloheptatrienylium (Tropylium) Ion |first1=W. von |last1=Eggers Doering |first2=L.

The tropylium ion is an acid in aqueous solution (i.e., an [[Acid–base reaction|Arrhenius acid]]) as a consequence of its Lewis acidity: it first acts as a Lewis acid to form an adduct with water, which can then donate a proton to another molecule of water: C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ⇌ C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;OH + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.  ([[Boric acid]] gives acidic aqueous solutions in much the same way.)  The equilibrium constant is 1.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–5&lt;/sup&gt;, making it about as acidic in water as acetic acid.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Mass spectrometry==
The tropylium ion is frequently encountered in [[mass spectrometry]] in the form of a signal at [[Mass-to-charge ratio|''m''/''z'']]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;91 and is used in [[mass spectrum analysis]]. This fragment is often found for aromatic compounds containing a benzyl unit. Upon [[Electron ionization|ionization]], the benzyl fragment forms a cation ({{chem|PhCH|2|+}}), which rearranges to the highly stable tropylium cation ({{chem|C|7|H|7|+}}).

==Reactions==
The tropylium cation reacts with nucleophiles to form substituted cycloheptatrienes, for example:&lt;ref name="agarwai"&gt;{{cite book | title = Reactions and Reagents | author = O. P. Agarwai | publisher = Krishna Prakashan Media | isbn = 9788187224655 | year = 2009 | edition = 46th | pages = 614–615}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{chem|C|7|H|7|+}} + {{chem|CN|-}} → {{chem|C|7|H|7|CN}}

Reduction by [[lithium aluminum hydride]] yields [[cycloheptatriene]].&lt;ref name="agarwai"/&gt;

Reaction with a [[sodium cyclopentadienide|cyclopentadienide]] salt of [[sodium]] or [[lithium]] yields 7-cyclopentadienylcyclohepta-1,3,5-triene:&lt;ref name="agarwai"/&gt;
:{{chem|C|7|H|7|+|X|-}} + {{chem|C|5|H|5|-|Na|+}} → {{chem|C|7|H|7|C|5|H|5}} + {{chem|Na|X}}

When treated with oxidising agents such as [[chromic acid]], the tropylium cation undergoes rearrangement into [[benzaldehyde]]:&lt;ref name="agarwai"/&gt;

:{{chem|C|7|H|7|+}} + {{chem|H|Cr|O|4|-}} → {{chem|C|6|H|5|C|H|O}} + {{chem|Cr|O|2}} + {{chem||H|2|O}}

Many metal complexes of tropylium ion are known.  One example is [Mo(η&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which is prepared by hydride abstraction from [[cycloheptatrienemolybdenum tricarbonyl]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, Malcolm L. H.; Ng, Dennis K. P. "Cycloheptatriene and -enyl Complexes of the Early Transition Metals" Chemical Reviews 1995, volume 95, pp. 439-73. {{DOI|10.1021/cr00034a006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1869">In [[turbomachinery]], a '''velocity triangle''' or a '''velocity diagram''' is a triangle representing the various components of velocities of the [[working fluid]] in a [[turbomachinery|turbomachine]]. Velocity triangles may be drawn for both the inlet and outlet sections of any turbomachine. The [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] nature of [[velocity]] is utilized in the triangles, and the most basic form of a velocity triangle consists of the tangential velocity, the absolute velocity and the relative velocity of the fluid making up three sides of the triangle.

==Velocities involved==

'''Woodchopping''' (also spelled '''wood-chopping''' or '''wood chopping'''), called '''woodchop''' for short, is a sport that has been around for hundreds of years in several cultures. In woodchopping competitions, skilled contestants attempt to be the first to cut or saw through a log or other block of wood. It is often held at [[state fair]]s and [[agricultural show]]s.  Participants (especially men) are often referred to as '''axemen'''.
[[Image:Corte hachu.jpg|thumb|right|Woodchopping competition at [[Avilés]], Spain]]

==History==
The modern sport of woodchopping is said to have had its genesis in 1870 in [[Ulverstone, Tasmania]], as the result of a £25 ($50) bet between two axemen as to who could first fell a tree.&lt;ref name="nswaxemen.asn.au"&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew |url=http://www.nswaxemen.asn.au/Introduction/Introduction.html |title=Introduction to woodchopping |publisher=Nswaxemen.asn.au |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative origin story comes from 16th century [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], in which a man ran a marathon and chop ten logs to be allowed to propose to his future wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=English|first1=Nick|title=Woodchopping Is the Best Strength Workout You've Never Tried - BarBend|url=https://barbend.com/woodchopping-best-strength-workout-youve-never-tried/|website=BarBend|accessdate=24 January 2017|date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first woodchopping championship was held in 1891, at Bell's Parade, [[Latrobe, Tasmania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.axemanscomplex.com.au/history.html |title=History of the Australian Axeman's Hall of Fame &amp; Timberworks &amp;#124; Latrobe &amp;#124; Tasmania &amp;#124; Australia |publisher=Axemanscomplex.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426045230/http://www.axemanscomplex.com.au/history.html |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was celebrated and commemorated with the selection of the site to be the home of the Australian Axemen's Hall of Fame and Timberworks.

==Areas of practice==
Woodchopping is practiced in regions where forestry is or has been an important part of the economy:
* In [[North America]]: in [[Canada]] and in the north of the [[United States]].
* In [[Europe]]: in [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]], [[England]], [[Slovenia]], the Alpine region of [[France]], the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]], other parts of [[Spain]] (mainly in [[Asturias]] and [[Cantabria]], but also in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and [[Madrid]]).
* In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

==Events==
[[Image:144th Wagga Wagga Show wood chopping.jpg|thumb|Woodchopping (standing block) at the [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]] [[Agricultural show|Show]], Australia]]
[[File:Wood chopping competion (standing block cut).webm|thumb|Wood chopping competition (standing block cut with handicap start), [[Ekka]], Brisbane, 2015 (audio/video 56s)]]
[[File:Woodchoppers competing.JPG|thumb|Underhand cutting]]
[[File:Queensland State Archives 5507 Tree felling contest at the Royal National Show Brisbane c 1958.png|thumb|Tree felling]]
Many woodchopping events are [[Handicapping|handicap]] events, where the axemen start at different times, depending on how fast they are expected to chop through the log. In New Zealand and parts of Australia, each axeman's individual handicap is recorded in performance books which are graded on how many events they win and how many events they enter. Championship events are scratch events with no handicap, and typically use larger diameter logs (375&amp;nbsp;mm).

Handicap events may use logs of 250&amp;nbsp;mm to 350&amp;nbsp;mm, depending on the skill of the competitors. All competitors have the same size log; the handicap is based purely on time.

=== Standing block ===
This event is done by an individual cutting a scarf in one side.  Once the first side has been completed the individual starts cutting another scarf on the opposite side, slightly higher than the first, generally about two inches higher but can vary with each axeman’s individual preference.&lt;ref name="NZAN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://axemen.co.nz/ |title=New Zealand Axemen's News |publisher=Axemen.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underhand ===
In this event, the axeman stands on the top of the log and uses a downwards motion to chop the log in two as fast as possible.  This is done by cutting a scarf in the front side and then turning around on the block and completing it from the other side. These scarfs are generally offset from each other, the degree of offset depending on the size of the log and the axeman’s preference.&lt;ref name="NZAN" /&gt;

=== Tree felling ===
In this event the axeman cuts a small pocket in the side of a pole and jams a wooden jigger board with a metal shoe on the end of it into the hole. The shoe is designed to grip into the wood when pressure is put on it from the top. After the axeman has climbed onto his first board he then cuts another pocket and so on. Once up on his top board he proceeds to cut the block on the top of the pole.

There are two distinct versions of tree felling:
* The three board,&lt;ref name="nswaxemen.asn.au" /&gt; which is most common in Australia and New Zealand. The axeman goes up one side of the pole and cuts his first scarf in the side of the block. The axeman then descends the pole and repeats this on the other side of pole. This event is seen as the marathon event of woodchopping and it typically lasts three to five minutes.
* The two (and one) board, commonly called the spring board, which is the most common in North America In the spring board the axeman climbs the one or two boards,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlog.com/CANLOGrules09.doc ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927165149/http://www.canlog.com/CANLOGrules09.doc |date=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then makes a large scarf in the front of the log - unlike on the ground where it is usually half and half. The axeman then turns around on the top board and chops through the block using downwards blows only.  This event lasts 50 to 80 seconds, much less than the jigger board.&lt;ref name="NZAN" /&gt;

=== Single saw or single buck ===
This event is often considered the hardest discipline in woodchopping. The competitor pulls and pushes a razor sharp saw specifically designed for the event. The saws vary in length from five foot six inches to six foot four inches. The saws cost between $1500 and $2000.

=== Double saw or double buck ===
[[File:Trontzea, Euskal Herria.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Woodchopping in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]]]
This event consists of two people pulling and pushing a saw to cut a log. It is far faster than the single saw event as there are two people using the saw yet times for this event can be two or three times faster in the same size wood.  The saws used in double tend to be a lot hungrier, that is, they cut and draw more wood out with each stroke. This, however, makes it far harder to push and pull the saw.

=== Stock saw ===
In this event the axemen use identically tuned and sharpened chainsaws to cut through a log, once downwards and once upwards, within a 3-inch space of wood. The competitor starts with their hands on top of the log. On a buzzer the axeman picks up the saw and pulls the starting cord and then makes his first cut downward, then his second cut upward. If the saw does not start that is just bad luck and they get a slow time. If the axeman takes over more than the allocated wood then they are disqualified and no time is recorded.&lt;ref name="espn_stihl"&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/timbersports/index Stihl Timbersports website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210183037/http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/timbersports/index |date=2009-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hot saw===
This event is often the crowd's favourite {{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2017}}, and certainly the loudest. It uses a large homemade methanol-run chainsaw. The saws used by top competitors are typically snowmobile engines cut in half and are far heavier than regular chainsaws.  The start for this event is exactly the same as the stock saw except the log is bigger and the axeman has to do three cuts: the first in a downwards motion, the second upwards, and the third down. This event is the fastest by far, lasting between five and seven seconds.&lt;ref name="espn_stihl" /&gt;

== Equipment ==
* [[Axe]]s are the main piece of equipment used in the sport of woodchopping. As there are many different types of wood, there are naturally a large  variety of axes.
* Purpose-built racing saws have developed over the years into two different types – the Peg and Raker saw and the 'm tooth' saw. There are a number of different suppliers of gear that sell to the select market of woodchoppers.
* Also used in chopping wood, although alone would not likely get the job done, is a wedge and sledgehammer.

== Different types of woods ==
[[Image:Stacked wood.JPG|thumb|250px|Chopped and stacked [[oak]] wood]]
Many different types of wood are used in the sport and they vary between countries. Common woods used in competition in Australia are gum, mountain ash, woolley butt and poplar. The most common woods cut in New Zealand are radiata pine (''Pinus radiata''), poplar and ''Pinus strobus''. Woods cut in America include white pine, alder, aspen frozen wood and cotton wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuatahiaxes.com/ |title=Tuatahi Racing Axes and Saws |publisher=Tuatahiaxes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Woodchopping by country==
The rules of the sport vary from country to country.

=== Australia ===
Woodchopping events in Australia are generally run in conjunction with [[agricultural show]]s. Competitions can run for up to 10 days, with over 100 competitors at each show.

In the [[Jack Pollard]]'s 1968 or 1969 editions of the ''Ampol's Australian Sporting Records'' woodchopping records appear to run from the 1920s &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Pollard, Jack, 1926- | title=Ampol's Australian sporting records | publication-date=1969 | publisher=Pollard Publishing Co | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21444147 | accessdate=23 January 2017 }} page 548&lt;/ref&gt;

The Axeman's Hall of Fame is located in [[Latrobe, Tasmania]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The peak body for the sport in Australia is the Australian Axemen's Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Woodchopping|url=http://www.australianaxemen.org.au/|website=Australian Axemen's Association|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basque Country===
{{main|Aizkolaritza}}

The sport is called ''aizkolaritza'' in [[Basque language|Basque]] from ''aizkolari'' "wood-chopper".  The sport is very popular and competitions are common at most festivals.

=== New Zealand ===
New Zealand is a leading country in the sport of woodchopping, having had the world's top two competitors; [[Jason Wynyard]], and [[David Bolstad]] who died in November 2011. Competitions are generally held at A &amp; P shows, but there are also shows dedicated to wood chopping.&lt;ref name="NZAN" /&gt;
