      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6226">[[Abstinence]] is the refraining from enjoyments which are lawful in themselves. Abstinence in general can be considered a virtue only when it serves the purpose of consecrating a life to a higher purpose. The saints, or adherents of religious and philosophical systems that teach the [[mortification of the flesh]], practice [[asceticism]] only with the view of perfecting the soul for the higher state of bliss for which they believe it to be destined.

== Disapproved of in  the Prophets ==
The [[Jewish religion]], having for its fundamental ethical principle the law of holiness: "Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy" ([[Lev.]] xix. 2), accentuates the perfectibility of the whole man, while demanding the sanctification of all that pertains to human existence. "The Lord did not create the world for desolation; he formed it for human habitation" ([[Isa.]] xlv. 18) is the principle emphasized by the rabbis ([[Pes.]] 88b). In the ideal state of things nothing should be profane. "In that day there shall be [inscribed] upon the bells of the horses: Holiness unto the Lord! And the pots in the Lord's house shall be like the bowls before the altar" ([[Zech.]] xiv. 20, 21). This view is expressed in no uncertain terms by [[Abba Arika|Rab]] in [[Yer.]] [[Kid.]] iv., at the end: "Man in the life to come will have to account for every enjoyment offered him that was refused without sufficient cause."

== Disapproved of in the Talmud ==
Accordingly, we find [[asceticism in Judaism|asceticism]], or abstinence as a principle, condemned in the [[Talmud]]. "Why must the Nazarite bring a sin-offering at the end of his term? ([[Num.]] vi. 13, 14). Because he sinned against his own person by his vow of abstaining from wine," says [[Eliezer ha-Kappar]] ([[Sifra]], ad loc., and [[Ned.]] 10a), drawing his conclusion from this Biblical passage: "Whosoever undergoes fasting and other penances for no special reason commits a wrong." "Is the number of things forbidden by the Law not enough that you venture to add of your own accord by your inconsiderate vow?" says [[R. Isaac]] ([[Yer.]] [[Ned.]] ix. 41b). See [[Maimonides]], ''Yad ha-chazakah'', De'ot, iii. 1, where the monastic principle of abstinence, whether in regard to marriage or to eating of meat and drinking of wine, or to any other personal comfort, is most emphatically condemned as antagonistic to the spirit of [[Judaism]].

== Tolerated in the Talmud ==
Still abstinence is frequently considered meritorious, if not actually necessary, as a means of self-discipline. [[Simon the Just]] said: "I partook of a Nazarite meal only once, when I met with a handsome youth from the South who had taken the vow. When I asked him the reason, he said: 'I saw the Evil Spirit pursue me as I beheld my face reflected in the water, and I swore that these long curls shall be cut off and offered as a sacrifice to the Lord.' Whereupon I kissed him upon his forehead and blessed him, saying: 'May there be many Nazarites like thee in Israel!'" ([[Nazir (Talmud)|Nazir]], 4b). In this sense abstinence is supposed to have a positive value, as a training in self-control. Consequently, the law: "Be holy!" was interpreted: Exercise abstinence in order to arrive at the state of purity and holiness ([[Ab. Zarah]], 20b; [[Sifra]], [[Kedoshim]], beginning). 

Excessive indulgence in wine or in any form of enjoyment being harmful ([[Prov.]] xxiii. 20), man must learn self-restraint in due time. "Haste!" people say to the Nazarite. "Pass quickly around the vineyard, come not too near the grape" ([[B. M.]] 92a) became the proverbial warning. "Make a fence around the Law" ([[Pirkei Avot|Ab.]] i. 1; [[Ab. R. N.]] ii.). "Abstain from everything evil and from whatsoever is like unto it," a rule found alike in the ''[[Didache]]'', iii. 1, and in the Talmud ([[Hul.]] 44b)—a saying based on [[Book of Job]], xxxi. 1. "Abstain from lusts of the flesh and the world" (''Didache,'' i. 4). All the Mosaic laws concerning diet are declared by [[Abba Arika|Rav]] to have for their purpose the purification of Israel ([[Lev. R.]] 13)—to train the Jew in self-discipline.

Accordingly, there were those that taught and practised abstinence for the purpose of self-consecration. Such were the followers of the Rechabites ([[Book of Jeremiah|Jer.]] xxxv. 2) among the [[Essenes]], "the water-drinkers" ([[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mek.]], [[Yithro]], Amalek 2). A revival of their principles was attempted in [[Persia]] by [[Abu Isa al-Ispahani]] in the 8th century, who added to the prohibition of wine also that of meat. With this may be compared the [[vegetarianism]] of the modern sect of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]]. The tendency to mysticism induced moral philosophers of the Middle Ages like [[Bahya ibn Paquda]] to favor abstinence as a mode of moral self-elevation (see ''Chobot ha-Lebabot,'' ix. 5, xi. 6).

The Biblical narrative, however, according to which man, in the golden age of innocence ([[Gen.]] i. 29), abstained from eating the flesh of animals, while after the flood, in an age of decline, the eating of meat, with the exception of the blood, was permitted (Gen. ix. 2 et seq.), is in striking accord with [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] or [[Aryan]] tradition ([[Plato]], ''De Legibus,'' vi. 782; [[Plutarch]], ''Symposion,'' viii. 83; [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyrius]], ''De Abstinentia,'' iii. 25, 26; [[Diogenes Laertius]], viii. 20; Spiegel, ''Eranische Alterthümer,'' i. 455).

== The rule ==
As a rule, however, Jewish opinion has been against total abstinence, and is best represented by [[Maimonides]], who advocates the "golden middle way" of moderation (''Yad ha-Chazakah'', Hilkot De'ot, i.-iii.).

'''Anglo''' is a prefix indicating a relation to the [[Angles]], [[England]], the [[English people]] or the [[English language]], such as in the term ''[[Anglo-Saxon language]]''.  It is often used alone, somewhat loosely, to refer to people of [[British Isles]] descent in the [[Americas]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and [[Australia]].  It is also used, both in English-speaking and non-English-speaking countries, to refer to Anglophone people of other [[Europe]]an origins.

Anglo is a [[Late Latin]] [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] used to denote ''English-'' in conjunction with another [[toponym]] or [[demonym]].  The word is [[Etymology|derived]] from Anglia, the Latin name for England and still used in the modern name for its eastern region, [[East Anglia]].  Anglia and England both mean ''land of the [[Angles]]'', a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] people originating in the north German [[peninsula]] of [[Angeln]], that is, the region of today's Lower Saxony that joins the Jutland Peninsula and thus forms an angle, so the Romans named it "Angulus".

It is also often used incorrectly to refer to ''British'' in historical and other contexts after the [[Acts of Union 1707]], for example such as in the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]], where in later years agreement was between the British government and the Dutch, not an English government.  Typical examples of this use are also shown below, where non-English people from the British Isles are described as being ''Anglo''.

''Anglo'' is not an easily defined term.  For traditionalists, there are [[natural language|linguistic]] problems with using the word as an adjective or noun on its own.  For example, the purpose of the ''-o'' ending is to enable the formation of a compound term (for example ''Anglo-Saxon'' meaning of Angle and [[Saxons|Saxon]] origin), so there is only an apparent parallelism between, for example, [[Latino (demonym)|Latino]] and Anglo.  However, a [[semantic change]] has taken place in many English-speaking regions so that in informal usage the meanings listed below are common. The definition is changed in each region which defines how it is identified.

===Australia===
{{Main article|Anglo-Celtic Australian}}
In Australia, ''Anglo'' is used as part of the terms ''Anglo-Australian'' and ''[[Anglo-Celtic]]'', which refer to the majority of Australians, who are of English, Scottish, [[Welsh people|Welsh]] and Irish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/49f609c83cf34d69ca2569de0025c182!OpenDocument |title=1301.0 – Year Book Australia, 1995 |accessdate=24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], and especially in [[Canadian French]], the terms ''[[English speaking|Anglophone]]'', ''[[English Canadian|Anglo-Canadian]]'' or simply ''Anglo'', are widely used to designate someone whose [[mother tongue]] is English, as opposed to ''[[Francophone]]'', which describes someone whose mother tongue is French, and to ''[[Allophone (Canadian usage)|Allophone]]'', which describes someone whose mother tongue is a language other than English or French. (In Quebec, the word ''[[English speaking|Anglophone]]'' or ''Anglo'' refers to [[English-speaking Quebecer]]s in both English and French.) ''[[Anglo-Metis]]'' is also sometimes used to refer to a historical ethnic group.

===Israel===
Immigrants from English-speaking countries are sometimes referred to as ''Anglos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/LiArt.jhtml?contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=16&amp;sbSubContrassID=0 |title=Israel Anglo File news, Israel diplomatic map}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
In [[Scotland]] the term ''Anglo-Scot'', often shortened to ''Anglos'', is used to refer to people with mixed Scottish-English ancestry, or people with English ancestry born in Scotland.

The term Anglo-Scot is more often used to describe Scottish sports players who are based in England or playing for English teams, or vice versa. This usage is especially used in football and notably in rugby union, where the [[Scottish Exiles (rugby union)|Anglo Scots]] were a Scottish non-native select provincial District side that competed in the [[Scottish Inter-District Championship]].

===United States===
{{Main article|Anglo-America}}
In many parts of the United States, especially those with high Hispanic populations, "Anglo-American" is shortened to "Anglo" and applied to white Americans who are not of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] origin and sometimes to those who are not of French origin, but the latter criterion is based on specific linguistic considerations and limited to Louisiana and parts of Texas.&lt;ref name=dictionary.com&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Anglo | title = Anglo – Definitions from Dictionary.com; American Heritage Dictionary | accessdate =29 March 2008 | publisher= Lexico Publishing Group, LLC| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080315013806/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Anglo| archivedate= 15 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in citation|date=October 2018}}

If language is taken into consideration the term "Anglo-American" also excludes [[Franco-American]]s such as the [[Cajun]]s of [[Louisiana]], but would include them when language is excluded as a criterion.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In the [[Southwest United States]], "Anglo", short for "Anglo American", is used as a synonym for [[non-Hispanic Whites]]; that is [[European American]]s (except people who speak Latin languages), most of whom speak the English language, even those who are not necessarily of English or British descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Marian Jean|last=Barber|title=How the Irish, Germans, and Czechs Became Anglo: Race and Identity in the Texas-Mexico Borderlands PhD dissertation|publisher=University of Texas|location=Austin|date=2010|oclc=876627130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some non-Hispanic whites in the United States who speak English but are not of English or British ancestry do not identify with the term ''Anglo'' and find the term offensive. For instance, some [[Cajuns]] in south [[Louisiana]] use the term to refer to area whites who do not have [[Francophone]] backgrounds. [[Irish American]]s, the second largest self-identified ethnic group in the United States following [[German-Americans]], also sometimes take umbrage at being called "Anglo".&lt;ref&gt;"The Irish-Mexican Thing" by Julie Reynolds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1201">'''Art in Public Places''' ('''AiPP''') is a common term for [[public art]] programs at the local government level (cities, counties).  Art in Public Places programs manage the selection, installation, and maintenance of public art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americansforthearts.org/by-program/networks-and-councils/public-art-network/tools-resources/public-art-administrators|title=Program Management and Best Practices, Americans for the Arts|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The term does not refer to [[public art]] in general or to individual public artworks.  Art in Public Places programs are publicly administered, often overseen by public art review committees and permanent staff (Arts Coordinators).  Under the auspices of local government they may receive public funding as well as private funding.&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley, John.  1980.

{{Bosniaks}}

'''Bosniaks''' are an ethnic group living in '''Slovenia'''. According to the last census from 2002, the total number of [[Bosniaks]] in [[Slovenia]] was 32,009 as they comprised 1.6% of the [[Demographics of Slovenia|total population of Slovenia]]. According to the last census, they are the third largest minority ethnic group in Slovenia, after [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]].

==Geography==
Bosniaks in Slovenia primarily live in the capital city of Slovenia; [[Ljubljana]]. There are dispersed populations of Bosniaks living in various cities and towns in Slovenia, though most choose to live in Ljubljana. Many Bosniaks have left Slovenia for other Western countries and [[Bosnia]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://balkanologie.revues.org/index585.html|title=Changing Contexts and Redefinitions of Identity among Bosniaks in Slovenia|first=Špela|last=Kalčić|date=1 December 2005|journal=Balkanologie. Revue d'études pluridisciplinaires|issue=Vol. IX, n° 1-2|accessdate=28 August 2017|via=balkanologie.revues.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosniaks make up a tiny percentage of Slovenia's population, however today, many Bosniaks have retained their identity and culture.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mošeja-Log pod Mangartom1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The first Bosniak [[mosque]] in Slovenia was built in 1916 in [[Log pod Mangartom]] on the slopes of the [[Alps]].]]
During the [[World War I|First World War]], a [[Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry|Bosniak regiment]] made up primarily of Bosnian Muslims were sent to fight on the [[Italy|Italian]] front.&lt;ref name="webs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bogbosnaibosnjastvo.webs.com/drugiobosnjacimaopisi.htm|title=Drugi o Bosnjacima opisi|website=BOG BOSNA I BOSNJASTVO - Bosnian history info|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the soldiers who fought there was a boy called [[Elez Dervišević]], the youngest soldier to fight in the Soca battle in World War I.&lt;ref name="webs.com"/&gt; Elez was 11 years old when he served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. In [[Log pod Mangartom]] there is a statue of Elez's father dedicated to him.&lt;ref name="webs.com"/&gt;

Many Bosniaks have migrated to Slovenia since the 1960s due to economic factors. Most of these Bosniaks were not well liked by Slovenians.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Slovenians grouped Bosniaks with Serbians, Croatians and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]]. These groups were often called ''južnjaki'' (southerners), ''ta spodni'' (those from down there), ''čefurj'' and ''Švedi'' ([[Swedes]]), all had negative connotations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Religion==
Today, the majority of Bosniaks are predominantly Sunni Muslim and adhere to the [[Hanafi]] school of thought, or law, the largest and oldest school of [[Islamic law]] in jurisprudence within [[Sunni Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?rog3=SI&amp;peo3=10953|title=Bosniak in Slovenia|website=Joshuaproject.net|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Capital punishment]]''' is a legal penalty in '''[[Malaysia]]'''. It is a mandatory punishment for [[murder]], [[capital punishment for drug trafficking|drug trafficking]], [[treason]], and waging war against [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (the King). Recently, the law was extended to include acts of terrorism. Any terrorists, and anyone who aids terrorists, financially or otherwise, is liable to face the death penalty. Since January 2003, the death penalty in Malaysia has been a mandatory punishment for rapists that cause death and [[child rape|child rapists]]. A 1961 law states that kidnapping carried a life sentence or a death sentence, preceded by a whipping. {{cn|date=June 2018}}

In October 2018, the [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian government]] announced that it would be tabling a bill to abolish the death penalty in Malaysia. In addition, the Government has also imposed a moratorium on all executions until the death penalty is abolished.&lt;ref name="NST 11 Oct 18"&gt;{{cite news |title=Death penalty to be abolished |url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2018/10/419931/death-penalty-be-abolished |accessdate=11 October 2018 |publisher=''[[New Straits Times]]'' |date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA 10 Oct 18"&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia to abolish death penalty; Bill may be tabled soon |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/malaysia-to-abolish-death-penalty-bill-may-be-tabled-soon-10812718 |accessdate=11 October 2018 |publisher=[[Channel News Asia]] |date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC 11 Oct 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shelton |first1=Tracey |last2=Renaldi |first2=Erwin |title=Malaysian Government's plans to abolish death penalty could save Sydney grandmother's life |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-11/malaysia-to-abolish-the-death-penalty/10363948 |accessdate=11 October 2018 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea behind capital punishment in Malaysia arose from a mix between the common law system that Malaysia inherited during their colonisation period from the British and the authorisation of certain punishments from Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Novak Global Decline of Mandatory Death Penalty: Constitutional Jurisprudence and Legislative Reform in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean (Ashgate Publishing Ltd, Burlington, England, 2014) page 76&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, death penalties are carried out in Malaysia through hanging and the penalty is used for a variety of offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Universal Periodic Review Second Cycle - Malaysia - Reference Documents |url=https://archive.is/20150428060804/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRMYStakeholdersInfoS17.aspx |publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Malaysia carried out nine executions, imposed 36 death sentences, and two death sentences were commuted. Malaysia was also reported to have 1,042 death row inmates, including 413 foreign nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Death sentences and executions in 2016|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/5740/2017/en/ |publisher= amnesty.org |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 10 October 2018, [[Liew Vui Keong]], the minister in charge of law in the [[Prime Minister's Department (Malaysia)|Prime Minister's Department]], announced that the Malaysian Government would abolish the death penalty. A proposed bill is expected to be tabled at the next sitting of Parliament. The minister also announced that the Government had imposed a moratorium on all executions until the passage of the new law. The current [[Pakatan Harapan]] government had campaigned on reviewing capital punishment and other "unsuitable" national security laws during the [[2018 Malaysian general election]].&lt;ref name="NST 11 Oct 18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA 10 Oct 18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC 11 Oct 2018" /&gt; The Government's announcement to abolish capital punishment was welcomed by [[Kumi Naidoo]], [[Amnesty International]]'s Secretary General, who called on the [[Parliament of Malaysia|Malaysian Parliament]] to consign the death penalty to the history books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Malaysia: Parliament must consign death penalty to the history books |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/10/malaysia-death-penalty-abolition/ |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Abduction, wrongful restraint or wrongful confinement for ransom – ''Section 3(1) [[Kidnapping Act 1961]]''

Only [[Courts of Malaysia#High Courts|High Courts]] had jurisdiction in capital cases. Appeals to the [[Courts of Malaysia#Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] and the [[Courts of Malaysia#Federal Court|Federal Court]] are automatic. The last resort for the convicted is to plead [[pardon]] for clemency. Pardons or clemency were granted by the [[Malay Ruler|Ruler]] or [[Yang di-Pertua Negeri]] (Governor) of the [[States of Malaysia|state]] where the crime was committed or the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] if the crime was committed in the [[Federal Territory (Malaysia)|Federal Territories]] or when involving members of the [[Malaysian Armed Forces|armed forces]]. Death sentences were carried out by [[Executed by hanging|hanging]] as provided in Section 277 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Pregnant women and minors may not be sentenced to death. In lieu of the death penalty, women pregnant at the time of sentencing would have their sentences reduced to life imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;As provided by the [[Criminal Justice Act 1953]], a life sentence is deemed as 30 years imprisonment. The sentence may be remitted after serving two-thirds of the sentence, i.e. 20 years.&lt;/ref&gt; as provided by Section 275 of the Criminal Procedure Code, while juvenile offenders would be detained [[at Her Majesty's pleasure|at the pleasure]] of the Ruler, Governor or Yang di-Pertuan Agong depending on where the crime was committed as provided by the Child Act 2001.

===Dangerous Drugs Act===
The death penalty for drug trafficking was made mandatory in 1983. The main reason for this was because drug trafficking was seen as one of the national challenges of the country. Since then, there has been a relaxation on this rule as death penalties may sometimes be substituted with a lighter sentence which includes mandatory whippings, forced rehabilitation or preventive detention.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Novak Global Decline of Mandatory Death Penalty: Constitutional Jurisprudence and Legislative Reform in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean (Ashgate Publishing Ltd, Burlington, England, 2014) pg 81&lt;/ref&gt; 

The presumption is that a person would be considered to be trafficking drugs if they were in possession of a certain amount of dangerous drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmacy.gov.my/v2/sites/default/files/document-upload/dangerous-drugs-act-1952.pdf Act 234 Dangerous Drugs Act,  1952 (Revised 1980), s37]&lt;/ref&gt; Under section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act, those in possession of 15&amp;nbsp;g or more heroin and morphine; 1,000&amp;nbsp;g or more opium (raw or prepared); 200&amp;nbsp;g or more cannabis; and 40&amp;nbsp;g or more cocaine will receive the mandatory death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysian Law Dangerous Drugs Act 1952|url=http://kl98.thecgf.com/athletes/drugs.html|website=The Official 16th Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur Website|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courts have affirmed that to establish prima facie drug trafficking, it has to be shown that the accused party was in actual possession of the drug and that the person has to have knowledge that they were in possession of the dangerous drug.&lt;ref&gt;Pendakwa Raya v Ouseng Sama-Ae [2008] 1 CLJ 337 at paragraph [7]&lt;/ref&gt; Once the death sentence has been passed, the sentence shall be passed on to the chief minister of the state where the judgment was given where a note about the evidence used in the case and a report about the judges opinion of the sentence would be included.&lt;ref name="593, s281(b)"&gt;[http://54.251.120.208/doc/laws/Act_593_-_Criminal_Procedure_Code_%28CPC%29.pdf Criminal Procedure Code No.593, s281(b)]&lt;/ref&gt; The minister then has a choice of either fixing a time and place for the execution to be carried out or may substitute in a lesser punishment if the minister wishes.&lt;ref name="593, s281(b)"/&gt;

The courts though have noted the severity of the sentence and in several instances have tried to impose a lower sentence where possible. One of the methods employed by the court would be to ensure that the procedures set out for the sentence have been strictly adhered to by the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Kwan Who v Public Prosecution [2009] 1 LNS 778 at paragraph [16] to [20]&lt;/ref&gt; The court in that case paid close attention to the evidence presented to ensure that the judgment made was the right one. The court has also acquitted a person when the reported amount of drugs seized was only slightly different from the amount of drugs received by the forensics lab chemist.&lt;ref&gt;Yusri bin Pialmi v Pendakwa Raya [2010] 6 CLJ 878 FC at paragraph [11]&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in amount was 10.21 grams.

There have also been suggestions by those in the executive for a re-appeal of the death sentence for drug trafficking. The Law Minister in 2012 held that the government may replace the death sentence with an imprisonment term instead in recognition that such a sentence only punishes the drug mules and not those higher up in the chain.&lt;ref&gt;Bernama, (20 October 2011). [http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/possible-moratorium-on-death-sentences-pending-govts-final-decision-nazri "Possible Moratorium on Death Sentences Pending Government’s Final Decision: Nazri"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303211824/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/possible-moratorium-on-death-sentences-pending-govts-final-decision-nazri |date=3 March 2016 }}, ''The Malaysian Insider''&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the fact that the death penalty does not seem to have the deterring effect that such a penalty was hoped to create, thus questioning the need for the penalty for that particular offence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2013&amp;dlid=220209, Bureau of Democrary, Human Rights and Labour, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2013 Malaysia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion and calls for abolition==
The abolition of the death penalty has started to gain momentum in Malaysia. The government has started to consider more humane ways to "uphold the justice for the people."&lt;ref&gt;Churchill Edward, (30 October 2011), [http://www.theborneopost.com/2011/10/30/abolition-of-death-penalty-in-malaysia/ "Abolition of Death Penalty in Malaysia?"], ''The Borneo Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The public are not as unsupportive for the abolishment of the death penalty as imagined. It was found that although a substantive portion of the public would agree for the death penalty in cases of murder, drug trafficking or firearms offences, this number took a considerable drop once the participants were told about the various scenarios which merited capital punishment as defined in the relevant statute.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hubert, 10 July 2013 [http://www.worldcoalition.org/death-penalty-project-malaysia-bar-public-opinion-roger-hood-mandatory-sentence.html "Malaysian Popular Support for Mandatory Death Penalty Overstated"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Universal Periodic Review 2009===
Malaysia has been reviewed twice by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] under the [[Universal Periodic Review]] (UPR). First in 2009 and the other in 2013. In 2009, Malaysia reported in their national report that the death sentence was only imposed on the most serious crimes and was in line with Article 6 of the ICCPR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/MY/A_HRC_WG6_4_MYS_1_E.PDF General Assembly report A/HRC/WG.6/4/MYS/Rev.1 at paragraph &amp;#91;89&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; They also held that there were several safeguards in place in the legal system that have to be met before a death penalty can be passed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/MY/A_HRC_WG6_4_MYS_1_E.PDF General Assembly report A/HRC/WG.6/4/MYS/Rev.1 at paragraph &amp;#91;90&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Of the various non-governmental organisations that made a submission for the review, three had an extract about the death penalty. The first was the [[Human Rights Commission of Malaysia]] [[Human Rights Commission of Malaysia|(SUHAKAM)]]. In their report, they noted that they were against the death penalty and natural life sentences and recommended that such cases be reviewed by the Pardon Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/MY/SUHAKAM_MYS_UPR_S4_2009_HumanRightsCommissionofMalaysia_NHRI_upr.pdf SUHAKAM Report 2009 at pg 3, paragraph &amp;#91;17&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International reported that although such a heavy punishment was being carried out, very little information about execution itself was actually made public. This included when the punished was set to be carried out, the person being punished and who had been executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/MY/AI_MYS_UPR_S4_2009_AmnestyInternational_upr.pdf Amnesty International Report 2008 at page 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

It appeared in the same report that according to 'Malaysians Against Death Penalty' there were a total of 300 inmates on death row in prison on January 2008. Most of them were for drug related offences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/MY/AI_MYS_UPR_S4_2009_AmnestyInternational_upr.pdf Amnesty International Report 2008 at page 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition of Malaysian NGOs in the UPR Process stated that they took the same stance as Amnesty International and noted that the death penalty went against the [[Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/MY/COMANGO_MYS_UPR_S4_2009_CoalitionofMalaysianNGOsintheUPRProcess_JOINT_upr.pdf The Coalition of Malaysian NGOs in the UPR Process Report at page 1]&lt;/ref&gt;
As for the Working Groups report, several nations including France, Djibouti, Egypt and Sudan recommended for a range of actions to be taken against the death penalty. This included suggestions of outright abolition to ratifying the ICCPR and applying the relevant standards when the death penalty was imposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/163/60/PDF/G0916360.pdf?OpenElement Working Group Report A/HRC/11/30* 2009 at pg 6 and 18]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia re-affirmed their position on the matter and stated that the death penalty was only applied in the most severe cases. However, they noted that they were at the time attempting to remove the death penalty and caning of those below the age of 18 through an amendment of the Essential (Security Cases) Regulations 1975 and at the same time, would consider a reduction in offences which carry the death penalty in a step towards the abolition of the death penalty outright.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/163/60/PDF/G0916360.pdf?OpenElement Working Group Report A/HRC/11/30* 2009 at pg 12]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Universal Periodic Review 2013===
In its national report, Malaysia re-iterated its statement made in the 2009 Periodic Review. They added though that there has recently been discussion with the public about the possibility of abolishment of the death penalty. They also noted that a study has been undertaken to reform the criminal justice in which included offences with a death penalty upon conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G13/161/32/PDF/G1316132.pdf?OpenElement Malaysia General Assembly Report A/HRC/WG.6/17/MYS/1 at paragraph &amp;#91;45&amp;#93; – &amp;#91;47&amp;#93;]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Amnesty International prepared another report for submission for the 2013 Universal Periodic Review. With regards about their submission to the death penalty in 2009, the organisation reported that none of the past recommendations have been implemented yet and reported that currently, there were a total of 930 inmates on death row.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRMYStakeholdersInfoS17.aspx Amnesty International Report page 2]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Child Rights Information Network]] reported that the death penalty was still in force in Malaysia which allowed for the death penalty sentence to be passed under Article 97 of the Child Act 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRMYStakeholdersInfoS17.aspx The Child Rights International Network Report at page 1]&lt;/ref&gt; The report submitted Joint Submission number 8 reported that convictions under s302 of the Penal code for murder still occurs in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt; Bernama,  (1 November 2012). [http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/death-sentence-on-duo-upheld-for-murder-of-businessman "Death sentence on duo upheld for murder of businessman"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233935/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/death-sentence-on-duo-upheld-for-murder-of-businessman |date=3 March 2016 }}, ''The Malaysian Insider''&lt;/ref&gt;

The report noted that Malaysia's approach to drug offences violated international standards. They further noted that there was a serious lack of due process given that those accused of drug trafficking are presumed guilty upon arrest. The organisation argued that as a result of these presumptions, it has led to hundreds of death sentences and executions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRMYStakeholdersInfoS17.aspx Joint Submission No.8 Joint Submission No.8 Report at paragraph 9]&lt;/ref&gt; They next reported that for treason which was punishable by death, at least 4 people were executed because of it in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/malaysia/report-2007 Amnesty International Report for 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the working group's report, several nations commented on the fact that Malaysia still has the death penalty and suggested that the death penalty be abolished or that a moratorium on the death penalty be recognised. Some of the nations that recommended this included Spain, Switzerland, Argentina, Belgium, Costa Rica and Kazakhstan. Malaysia responded with a statement that they would keep their options open and continue to engage the public on this subject. They would also look into alternatives to the death penalty. Malaysia pledged that it would complete its review on the moratorium of the death penalty with the intent to abolish it at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G13/188/48/PDF/G1318848.pdf?OpenElement Working Group Report A/HRC/25/10 at paragraph 146.106 to 146.111]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Bray''' (31 January 1811 – 5 October 1884) was a prosperous British ribbon manufacturer, social reformer, philanthropist, philosopher, and [[phrenology|phrenologist]].

==Life==

Charles Bray was a prosperous ribbon manufacturer who owned the ''[[Coventry Herald]]'' newspaper. His father had died in 1835, leaving him and each of his seven siblings a substantial inheritance. Charles married [[Cara Hennell|Caroline "Cara" Hennell]] (4 June 1814 – 21 February 1905) on 26 May 1836 at Hackney, Middlesex, England. A disciple of the social reformer [[Robert Owen]] (1771–1858), he used the wealth generated from his businesses to establish nonsectarian public schools and to try to bring about changes in society.

Bray was a freethinker in religious matters and a progressive in politics. He was also a disciple of the phrenologist [[George Combe]] (1788–1858).

==The Brays' "Rosehill Circle" in Coventry, Warwickshire==

The Brays' home "Rosehill" (in Coventry, Warwickshire) was a haven for people who held and debated radical views. People who participated in the "Rosehill Circle" included (among many others) social reformer [[Robert Owen]], philosopher/sociologist [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Harriet Martineau]], and transcendentalist [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. Most of the people who participated in the Rosehill Circle tended to have theologies that were considerably more liberal than the average (for example, many participants cast doubt on the supernatural elements of Bible stories).

The core group of the Rosehill Circle consisted of Charles Bray, his wife Caroline, and some of the members of Caroline's immediate family along with several of their close friends. The core group members from Caroline's immediate family were her sisters Mary Hennell (23 May 1802 – 16 May 1843) and [[Sara Hennell]] (1812–1899), and her brother [[Charles Christian Hennell]] (1809–1850). Charles Hennell was a writer on theological and philosophical topics whose most important work was ''An Inquiry Concerning the Origin of Christianity'' (London, 1838). Although Caroline's father James Hennell (8 October 1782 – 30 January 1816) was a devout Unitarian who raised his children as Unitarians, his 3 children who were core members of the Rosehill Circle all entertained serious reservations about many Unitarian beliefs.
 
On 1 November 1843 Charles C. Hennell married Elizabeth Rebecca "Rufa" Brabant (28 September 1811 – 1 March 1898), another core member of the Rosehill Circle. Elizabeth's father, physician Robert Herbert Brabant (14 November 1781 – 13 May 1866), was a core member as well. Elizabeth, in the months immediately preceding her engagement and marriage to Charles Hennell, had been under commission (by a private group associated with the Rosehill Circle) to translate into English the great theological treatise ''Das Leben Jesu, kritisch bearbeitet'' by [[David Friedrich Strauss]] (1808–1874). As soon as it had been first published (in Tübingen, Germany – vol. 1 in 1835, and vol. 2 in 1836), Strauss' ''Das Leben Jesu'' was recognized internationally as one of the most revolutionary and important theological treatises of the 19th century. Not surprisingly, the members of the private group which had commissioned the translation, led by the radical politician [[Joseph Parkes]] (1796–1865), were very eager to be able to read this great work in their native English. However, once it was realized that Elizabeth's marriage would mean an end to her translation work, in January 1844 it was decided that Mary Anne Evans (1819–1880) (later known as the novelist [[George Eliot]]) would take up the translating where Elizabeth had left off at the time of her marriage (which was about halfway through volume 1 of ''Das Leben Jesu''). Mary Anne had quickly become an integral part of the Rosehill Circle after she met and befriended Charles and Caroline Hennell in November 1841. Somewhat later she became an intimate friend of Elizabeth Brabant as well (Mary Anne served as a bridesmaid at Elizabeth's wedding in 1843). Mary Anne worked on the translation of Strauss' ''Das Leben Jesu'' (fourth German edition, 2 vols., 1840) for over 2 years, and in June 1846 the fruit of her (and Elizabeth's) labor was finally published (as an anonymous translation) under the title ''The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined'' (3 vols., London: Chapman Brothers, 1846).

As a leading light in the Coventry 'intelligentsia,' Bray helped to found The Coventry Labourers &amp; Artisans Co-operative Society Circa 1840–60, which provided gardens for working men and a co-op store. Inspired by the cottage factories in Coventry, he drew up a plan for a small community based on the same system – squares of 3–400 houses, each with their own steam engine to provide power and would be surrounded by enough land for each house to have its own allotment.

==Charles Bray – Publications==
(for the most part, only First Editions are listed below)

* 1836 – The Education of the Body : An Address to the Working Classes (Coventry, England: Printed by H. Merridew, 1836) (26 p.)
* 1838 – The Education of the Feelings (London: Taylor &amp; Walton, 1838) (195 p.)
* 1841 – The Philosophy of Necessity; or, The Law of Consequences; as Applicable to Mental, Moral, and Social Science (2 vols.) (London: Longman, Orme, Brown, Green and Longmans, 1841) (viii, 663 p.)

[ Vol. 2 ( pp.&amp;nbsp;493–663 ) contains an anonymous, untitled Appendix by Mary Hennell (1802–1843). Mary's authorship of this Appendix is known because the Appendix was reprinted ( under the title "Social Systems and Communities" ) in a book published in 1844, and in that book the authorship of the Appendix is attributed by Charles Bray to Mary ( see the next item for a complete explanation ). ]

* 1844 – An Outline of the Various Social Systems &amp; Communities which have been Founded on the Principle of Co-operation – With an Introductory Essay by the Author of "The Philosophy of Necessity" (London: Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1844) (cxiv, 252 p.)

[ Neither Charles Bray's nor Mary Hennell's name appears on the title page of this book, but bibliographers usually attribute the book to Mary Hennell. It is known that Charles Bray authored this book's "Preface" (pp. iii–iv) and "Introduction" (pp. v–cxiv) since Bray was the author of ''The Philosophy of Necessity''. The work by Mary Hennell ( 1802–1843 ) which had appeared as the anonymous, untitled Appendix in vol. 2 of Bray's ''The Philosophy of Necessity'' (1841) appears in this book under the title "Social Systems and Communities" as the second part (pp.&amp;nbsp;1–252) of the book. On p. iii of this book (in the Preface) Bray reveals that Mary Hennell was the author of the Appendix in vol. 2 of his ''The Philosophy of Necessity''. Also on p. iii of this book Bray states that Mary Hennell died of consumption in March 1843. However, other unrelated, genealogical sources exist which state that Mary Hennell died on 16 May 1843. At this time it is believed that 16 May 1843 is the correct date of Mary's death, but this has not been verified. ]

* 1844 – An Essay upon the Union of Agriculture and Manufactures : And upon the Organization of Industry (London: Longman &amp; Co., 1844) (114 p.)
* 1844 – An outline of the various social systems &amp; communities which have been founded on the principle of co-operation
* 1857 – The industrial employment of women : being a comparison between the condition of the people in the watch trade in Coventry, in which women are not employed, and the people in the ribbon trade
* 1871 – A manual of anthropology, or, The Science of man
* 1872 – The Education of the Feelings: A Moral System, Revised and Abridged for Secular Schools

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1825">A '''design code''' is a document that sets rules for the design of a new development in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is a tool that can be used in the design and planning process, but goes further and is more regulatory than other forms of guidance commonly used in the English planning system over recent decades. It can be thought of as a process and document – and therefore a mechanism – which operationalises design guidelines or standards which have been established through a masterplan process. The masterplan or design framework is the vision. It should be accompanied by a [[design rationale]] that explains the objectives, with the design code providing instructions to the appropriate degree or precision of the more detailed design work.

In this way a design code may be a tool which helps ensure that the aspirations for quality and quantity for housing developments, particularly for large-scale projects, sought by the Government and other agencies are actually realised in the final schemes. It has the potential to deliver the consistency in quality exposed as lacking by [[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment|CABE]]’s [[Housing Audit]] (2004).

Examples of developments where design codes are being used include:
*[[Poundbury]], [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]]
*[[Fairford Leys]], [[Aylesbury]]
*[[Fairfield Park]], [[Letchworth]]
*[[Ashford Barracks]], [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]]
*[[Upton, Northamptonshire|Upton, Northampton]]

{{English Feudalism}}
An [[oath]] of '''fealty''', from the [[Latin]] '''''fidelitas''''' ([[faithfulness]]), is a pledge of [[allegiance]] of one person to another.

==Definition==
In [[medieval]] [[Europe]], the swearing of fealty took the form of an oath made by a [[vassal]], or subordinate, to his [[lord]]. "Fealty" also referred to the duties incumbent upon a vassal that were owed to the lord, which consisted of service and aid.&lt;ref name=Coredon120&gt;Coredon ''A Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases'' p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

One part of the oath of fealty included swearing to always remain faithful to the lord. The oath of fealty usually took place after the act of [[homage (medieval)|homage]], when, by the symbolic act of kneeling before the lord and placing his hands between the hands of the lord, the vassal became the "man" of the lord. Usually, the lord also promised to provide for the vassal in some form, either through the granting of a [[fief]] or by some other manner of support.&lt;ref name=Saul102&gt;Saul "Feudalism" ''Companion to Medieval England'' pp. 102-105&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the oath took place upon a religious object such as a [[Bible]] or [[saint|saint's]] [[relic]], often contained within an [[altar]], thus binding the oath-taker before God. Fealty and homage were key elements of European [[feudalism]].

Fealty is distinct from other parts of the homage ceremony, and is usually used only to refer to that part of the ceremony where the vassal swore to be a good vassal to his lord.&lt;ref name=mcgurk13&gt;McGurk ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], an oath of fealty (German: '''''Lehnseid''''') was a fundamental element of the [[feudal system in the Holy Roman Empire]]. It was sworn between two people, the obliged person (''vassal'') and a person of rank (''liege lord''). The oath of allegiance was usually carried out as part of a traditional ceremony in which the liegeman or vassal gave his lord a pledge of loyalty and acceptance of the consequences of a breach of trust. In return the liege lord promised to protect and remain loyal to his vassal. The rights conferred on the vassal were so similar to actual possession that it was described as beneficial ownership (''[[dominium utile]]''), whereas the rights of the lord were referred to as direct ownership (''[[dominium directum]]'').

In the [[Late Middle Ages]], the investiture and oath of fealty were invariably recorded by a deed; in modern times this replaced the traditional ceremony. Where the geographical distance between the two parties was significant, the lord could name a representative before whom the oath was to be sworn.

The whole contract including the oath of fealty was part of a formal [[commendation ceremony]] that created the feudal relationship.&lt;ref name=Saul102/&gt;

The term is also used by English-speakers to refer to similar oaths of allegiance in other feudal cultures, as with [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan (1185–1868)|medieval Japan]], as well as in modern political contexts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6810">The '''[[Fiji]]an honours system''' dates from the granting of [[Dominion of Fiji|dominion]] status in 1970, when the [[Fijian Independence Medal]] was awarded to participants in the Fijian independence celebrations.  Prior to [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|two military coups]], which deposed [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as [[Monarchy of Fiji|Queen of Fiji]], ending the Fijian Monarchy, Fiji also had use of the [[British Honours System]].

==Republican honours==
After Fiji was declared a republic, outside the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in October 1987, there was no full honours system until 1995. However, in 1988 the [[Fiji Republic Medal]] was established with a military and civil division. The medal was awarded for meritorious and faithful service in the military, disciplined services, or civil service. For Fijian civilians the medal was awarded for outstanding public service to Fiji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI DECREE NO. 42 FIJI REPUBLIC MEDAL DECREE 1988 |url=http://www.paclii.org/fj/promu/promu_dec/frmd1988172.rtf |website=Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute |accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 with the passage of the Honours and Awards Act, 1995 established the [[Order of Fiji]] and a system of civil, military, and awards for the disciplined services.  One recipient was Sir [[Paul Reeves]], a former [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] of [[New Zealand]], who was awarded this honour for his work in drafting the 1997 [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|Constitution]] by the then [[President of Fiji|President]], [[Ratu]] [[Sir]] [[Kamisese Mara]].  Also made a Companion in  1997 was [[Satya Nandan]]. Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Sir [[Michael Somare]] was made a Companion during a state visit in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meeting the Prime Minister, Hon. Qarase, in his office|url=http://www.fiji.gov.fj/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=Somare&amp;id=11_G|work=State Visit by Sir Michael Somare, the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea|publisher=Government of Fiji|accessdate=1 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024224947/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=Somare&amp;id=11_G|archivedate=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After nobody claimed the boat, passers-by began painting messages and pictures on the boat. It became an unofficial symbol of Folly Beach.

On September 11th, 2017, flooding from [[Hurricane Irma]] again moved Folly Boat, depositing it next to a privately owned dock on Sol Legare Road.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2728">'''Gramanya''' ([[Devanagari]]:ग्रामण्य,{{IAST|Grāmaṇya}}) refers to a village-dispute or discussion (esp. upon matters of caste) in India in the past few centuries. 

==Overview==
Gramanya is a crystallisation of conflicts between two castes of individuals belonging to the same caste, and the same group, about observance of certain religious practices vis-a-vis, other members of the society or of the particular caste group. There are two types of Gramanyas inter-caste, and intra-caste.&lt;ref name=grm&gt;{{cite book|last=Kulakarni|first=Sumitra|title=The Satara raj, 1818–1848: a study in history, administration, and culture|pages=Pages: 187,188}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Records mention that Gramanyas took place in Maharashtra in late 18th and 19th century and various castes were involved in many disputes. There are also recorded instances of ''Gramanyas'' between [[Saraswat]]s and the [[Chitpawan]]s, [[CKP]]s and [[Chitpawan]]s, [[Pathare Prabhu]]s and the Chitpawans and the Shukla Yujurvedi [[Deshastha Brahmin]]s and the Chitpawans. The intra-caste disputes involved the supposed violation of the Brahmanical ritual code of behavior.
The disputes between the [[Maratha]]s and the [[Brahmin]]s happened in and 19th and 20th centuries. The disputes between [[Daivadnya]] and Brahmins happened in the 19th century. These disputes between castes were common in maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Chitpwans |last=Gokhale|first=Sandhya|publisher=Shubhi Publications|date=2008|pages=204|quote=The jati disputes were not a rare occurrence in Maharashtra. There are recorded instances of disputes between jatis such as Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhus and the Chitpawans, Pathare Prabhus and the Chitpawans, Saraswats and the Chitpawans and Shukla Yajurvedi and the Chitpawans. These intra-caste dispute involving the supposed violation of the Brahmanical ritual code of behavior was called Gramanya in marathi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wag"&gt;{{Citation|last=Israel|first=Milton |author2=Narendra K.

The '''Gulbenkian Commission''' sought to address inadequacies in the organization of the [[social sciences|social science]] disciplines that developed in the nineteenth century by indicating a direction for social scientific inquiry for the next 50 years. It was founded by the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]]. It held three meetings in 1994 and 1995.

== Members ==
Its members included [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (chair), Calestous Juma, [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], [[Jürgen Kocka]], Dominique Lecourt, [[Valentin Y. Mudimbe]], Kinhide Mushakoji, [[Ilya Prigogine]], Peter J. Taylor, Michel-Rolph Trouillot. Six of them were drawn from the [[social science]]s, two from the [[natural sciences]] and two from the humanities. The commission sought to produce a book length work that would identify new directions for the organization of knowledge in the next fifty years. The report was published in 1996 by [[Stanford University]] as the book, ''Open the Social Sciences'' by [[Immanuel Wallerstein]]. To foster international debate, the report has been published in numerous languages including [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbocroat]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

== Debate ==

The ideas in the report have stimulated [[debate]] around the [[world]]. For example, in the Indian Magazine Frontline, Sundar Sarukkai discussed its conclusions and applicability to the [[India]]n context, which he criticizes for being cliquish and unprofessional.&lt;ref&gt;Sarukkai, Sundar (2001). "The Gulbenkian Prognosis", ''Frontline'', 18(22). Retrieved from http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1822/18220900.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Michael Burawoy, at Berkeley, offered a highly critical perspective: "We hear nothing about how and where this new knowledge will be produced. Nor do we hear for whom this knowledge will be produced, nor for what ends. Instead we have an abstract and totalizing [[utopia]] that reflects the concerns of Western academics, perched high up in the [[ivory tower]], seemingly unaware that the fortress beneath them – supporting them -- was under siege".&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, Michael (2001). "Open the Social Sciences: To whom and for what?", Portuguese Journal of Social Science, 6(3). Retrieved from http://burawoy.berkeley.edu/PS/Open%20the%20Social%20Sciences.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; This comment was made in spite of the fact that the commission itself included academics from the Caribbean, Africa, and East Asia, as well as Europe and North America. Richard Lee suggests concrete ways that the Commission's goal of breaking down barriers between the disciplines of the social sciences might be achieved.

'''Homosexual transsexual''',&lt;ref name="EkinsKing2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Ekins|author2=Dave King|title=The Transgender Phenomenon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2TlvmbN9X7wC&amp;pg=PA88|date=23 October 2006|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-84787-726-0|pages=88–}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used by various [[sexology|sexologists]], [[psychologist]]s, and [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]] to describe [[trans women]] who are exclusively attracted to men, and less often [[trans men]] who are attracted to women. The term has become controversial. The concept of [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomically]] categorizing trans women by [[sexual orientation]] originated with [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] in 1923, and was further posited by [[Harry Benjamin]] in 1966 as a component of the [[Benjamin scale]]. The specific term ''homosexual transsexual'' was coined by [[Kurt Freund]] in 1973, and used from 1982 onward by him and others, notably [[Ray Blanchard]], as part of a two-type taxonomy of [[trans woman|male-to-female]] [[transsexuality]]. This taxonomy has subsequently evolved into, and is in the present day referred to, as [[Blanchard's transsexualism typology]].

In the [[DSM III]], published in 1980, transsexualism was to be diagnosed and the sexual orientation of a transsexual specified using the terms ''homosexual'', ''[[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]]'', ''[[Asexuality|asexual]]'', or unspecified. This convention had its origins in the taxonomic work of researchers like Hirschfeld, Benjamin, and Freund and the fact that grouping trans women by sexual orientation reveals important qualitative and statistical differences between them, and that said differences have been maintained by various researchers as indicative or suggestive of multiple, distinct [[etiology|etiologies]]. The term ''homosexual transsexual'' has since been used in publications by a variety of academics, including Benjamin, Freund, Blanchard, and [[Anne Lawrence]], as well as [[J. Michael Bailey]] and [[James Cantor]], among others.

The term ''homosexual transsexual'' has been criticized from a lexical standpoint by Benjamin, [[Bruce Bagemihl]], and [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] (though supported ''conceptually'' by the former two), as being confusing, as well as insensitive to the [[gender identity|gender identities]] of those whom it is intended to describe. The alternatives [[androphilia|''androphilic'']] and [[gynephilia|''gynephilic'']] have been proposed by [[Milton Diamond]] as descriptors for sexual orientation that do not make assumptions about the [[sex]] or gender identity of the person being described. Terms such as ''androphilia'' and ''gynephilia'' are sometimes used instead of, or concurrently with, ''homosexual'', ''heterosexual'', or ''non-homosexual'' in current research, such as research which has used the [[Androphilia and gynephilia#Androphilia and gynephilia scales|Modified Androphilia Scale]] to assess the attraction to men of a given trans woman.&lt;!--In the body of the article, I have pointed out that Blanchard, as well as Leavitt and Berger, have used the so called "modified androphilia scale", a psychological test, to assess the sexual orientation of a given transsexual. Finding one homosexual or non-homosexual based on the result.--&gt; S. J. Whang contended in 2004 that the term ''homosexual transsexual'' is "archaic". Though the term ''transsexuality'' was removed as a mental disorder from the [[DSM-IV]] and was replaced with [[gender identity disorder]] as a diagnostic label, attraction to males, females, both, or neither remains specified in the [[DSM IV-TR]].

Most research of the research on homosexual transsexuality has been conducted on trans women. They are usually socioeconomically disadvantaged, born later in a series of brothers, are unlikely to display cross-gender [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]] or [[autogynephilia]],&lt;!--For the person who feels a citation is needed here. Please see Blanchard 1987 http://www.springerlink.com/content/q025616175225557/ Referred to as classic Blanchard in this document's ref tags.  This same paper is linked in the body of the article.  The style guidelines do not provide for references inside the lead which is just a summary or abstract for the article. It is also more proper for this to be linked to autogynephilia than to feminization.--&gt; and [[Coming out|come out]] at a younger age than non-homosexual trans women. Relatively little research has been done on gender variance in assigned women  and the prevalence of [[trans men|female-to-male]] [[gender identity disorder]] (GID) is less than that of male-to-female GID.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The transsexual feels himself to be a woman ("trapped in a man’s body") and is attracted to men." (Benjamin 1966).&lt;ref name="benjamin1966"/&gt;

Homosexuality was removed as a mental disorder from the [[DSM-II]],  the diagnostic manual published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]], the most widely used diagnostic manual worldwide.&lt;ref name="Spitzer"&gt;

In 1980 in the DSM III, a new diagnosis was introduced, that of "302.5 Transsexualism" under "Other Psychosexual Disorders".

===Terminological debate===
The concept that transsexuals with homosexual and non-homosexual sexual orientations are etiologically different has a long history in this field.&lt;ref name="wahng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bagemihl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benjamin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diamond1980"/&gt;  However the terms used have not always been agreed on.&lt;ref name="bagemihl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benjamin"/&gt; In recent years scientists working on the topic have criticized the practice of categorizing transsexuals by sexual orientation and sex at birth.&lt;ref name="bagemihl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benjamin"&gt;{{cite book|last=BenjaminQ |first=Harry |authorlink= |title=The Transsexual Phenomenon |publisher= |date= |location=Chapter 2, Paragraph 16 |pages= |url=http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/chap_02.htm#Relationship%20to%20homosexuality |doi= |isbn= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913065950/http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/chap_02.htm |archivedate=September 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diamond2006"&gt;Diamond M (2006).

Others, such as biologist and linguist [[Bruce Bagemihl]], agree with what Benjamin wrote about the use of this term.&lt;ref name="bagemihl"/&gt; Bagemihl wrote that this terminology makes it easy to say transsexuals are really homosexual males seeking to escape from stigma.&lt;ref name="bagemihl"&gt;Bagemihl B.

====Alternative terms====
Professor of anatomy and reproductive biology, [[Milton Diamond]] (1990, 2002) proposed the use of the terms androphilic and gynephilic as alternatives to homosexual and heterosexual. Diamond wrote that the terms homosexual and heterosexual are confusing as applied to transsexual persons because it is not instantly clear whether they reference the pre- or post-transition state.&lt;ref name="diamond1980"&gt;Diamond M, Karlen A (1980). ''Sexual Decisions''.

Wahng said in 2004 that the diagnosis homosexual transsexual is archaic and conflates homosexuality with transsexuality.&lt;ref name="wahng"/&gt;

Sexological research has been done using these alternative terms by researchers such as Sandra L. Johnson (1990).&lt;ref name="Johnson1990"&gt;Johnson SL, Hunt DD (1990). The relationship of male transsexual typology to psychosocial adjustment. ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'', Volume 19, Number 4 / August, 1990 349-360.&lt;/ref&gt; In research done by Blanchard in 1985, and Leavitt they used a psychological test called the "modified androphilia scale" to assess whether a transsexual was homosexual or not.&lt;ref name="Blanchard1985b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"/&gt;

===Transgender community reaction===
According to Leavitt and Berger, "transsexuals, as a group, vehemently oppose the label and its pejorative baggage."&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"&gt;Leavitt, Frank; Berger, Jack C. (October), "Clinical patterns among male transsexual candidates with erotic interest in males", Archives of Sexual Behavior 19 (5): 491-505, doi:10.1007/BF02442350, 1573-2800&lt;/ref&gt; Trans woman [[Andrea James]] has called the term "inaccurate and offensive,"&lt;ref name="james2006"&gt;James A (2006). A defining moment in our history: Examining disease models of gender identity. ''Gender Medicine''. 3:56 {{ISSN|1550-8579}}&lt;/ref&gt; and trans man [[Aaron Devor]] wrote, "If what we really mean to say is attracted to males, then say 'attracted to males' or androphilic...

===Androphilic male-to-female transsexuals===

====Sexual activity====
Building on work by Freund, Frank Leavitt and Jack C. Berger in 1990 further categorized homosexual transsexuals by three patterns of sexual activity in how they used their penis.&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"/&gt; In their study 44% were sexually inactive, 19% avoided use of the penis during sex, and 37% derived pleasure from using the penis during sex. The groups showed varying levels of masculinity and emotional disturbance in development.&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"/&gt; Leavitt and Berger found that transsexuals in the avoidant group are different from those in the other two groups. They fit the description of the "nuclear transsexual".&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"/&gt; They had a strong cross gender identification, wanted female anatomy, had never married and little to no sexual activity with females.&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"/&gt; Of all the subgroups this group had the least comorbid [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"/&gt; The transsexuals in the pleasure group behaved sexually in ways that were "classically homosexual".&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"/&gt; They were more likely than those in the avoidant group to have had sexual experience with females.&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"/&gt; They also rated higher on a test of general [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]].&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"/&gt; Other than this, transsexuals in the pleasure group were similar to the description of a "nuclear transsexual".&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"/&gt; They found that transsexuals in the inactive group had characteristics which most differed from that of the "nuclear transsexual",&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"/&gt; such as strong heterosexual orientations (as determined from psychological testing), and fetish histories. "The pattern exhibited generally conforms to that exhibited by heterosexual transsexuals."&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"/&gt; The inactive group was found to share little with the other groups of transsexuals other than a stated sexual interest in males.&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"/&gt; Leavitt and Berger also mentioned studies by Blanchard which suggest that heterosexual transsexuals will adjust their life stories to ensure that they get sex reassignment surgery. (Leavitt 1990)&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"/&gt;

In ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', [[J. Michael Bailey]] (2003) wrote that the homosexual transsexuals he studied are comfortable with [[prostitution]],&lt;ref name="bailey2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bailey JM|year=2003|url=|title=The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism|work= }}Joseph Henry Press, {{ISBN|0-309-08418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that they have a masculine sexual appetite,&lt;!-- Read the book TMWWBQ one of Bailey's main points about "homosexual transsexuals" as he wrote was that they have the sex drive of a gay male, which like a straight male, is not the sex drive of a female.--&gt; but are attracted to men.&lt;ref name="bailey2003"/&gt; He reviewed evidence for a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] according to which there are two forms of [[transsexualism]] in males, one that is an extreme type of homosexuality and one that is an expression of a [[paraphilia]] known as [[autogynephilia]]. In ''[[The Transsexual Phenomenon]]'' (1966), [[Harry Benjamin]] writes that "Other transsexuals find prostitution a useful profession for emotional as well as practical reasons..."&lt;ref name="benjamin1966"/&gt;{{rp|50&amp;ndash;51}} Benjamin goes on to say "How much more can his femininity be reaffirmed than by again and again attracting normal, heterosexual, and unsuspecting men and even being paid for rendering sex service as a woman?"&lt;ref name="benjamin1966"/&gt;

====Socioeconomic factors====
Researchers have recently found several [[Demography|demographic]] features that homosexual transsexuals tend to have in common.&lt;ref name="zucker22002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen-Kettenis

They were, on average, in their mid-teens to mid-20s when they reported to a gender clinic for sex reassignment.&lt;ref name="psychology Research"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchardequation"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanchard | first1 = R | year = 1994 | title = A structural equation model for age at clinical presentation in nonhomosexual male gender dysphorics | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/w8351l1562t1g836/ | journal = [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 311–320 | doi=10.1007/bf01541566}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The homosexual transsexuals are more likely to have [[immigration|recent immigrant]] status, nonintact families, non-[[Caucasian race]], and childhood [[Anti-social behaviour|behavior problems]]).&lt;ref name="zucker22002"/&gt; Bailey found that most homosexual transsexuals learn to live on the streets, resorting to prostitution, or shoplifting.&lt;ref name="bailey2003"/&gt;

D.F. MacFarlane studied transsexuals in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; MacFarlane found that in New Zealand that 90% of the homosexual transsexual prostitutes were [[Māori people|Māori]],&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; an ethnic group who are only 9% of the overall population.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; In ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'' [[J. Michael Bailey]] writes that about 60% of homosexual transsexuals he studied in Chicago were [[Latina]] or black;&lt;ref name="bailey2003"/&gt; in his studies of gay males only 20% were non-white.(Bailey 2003)&lt;ref name="bailey2003"/&gt; Bailey quoted the opinions of two of his subjects who attributed the difference to genetics, or inflexible gender roles in their respective cultures.&lt;ref name="bailey2003"/&gt; MacFarlane similarly concluded that culture influenced the number of Māori homosexual transsexuals he observed.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt;

====Fraternal birth order effect====
Recent research on the causes of homosexual transsexualism, transsexualism, and homosexuality overlap to a large degree.&lt;ref name="Blanchardbrothers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zuckerbrothers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenbrothers"/&gt; The [[etiology of transsexualism]] concerns the causes of transsexuality in general, including the theory that transsexualism is caused by differences in specific areas of the brain, while relationships between [[biology and sexual orientation]] have been studied in depth as possible causes of homosexuality.&lt;!--Look at the sources on the fraternal birth order effect. Note that in particular Blanchard's study mentions homosexual transsexuals. Further consider the other causes found in both articles on etiology of transsexualism. (G'guy: Also please don't use self references in Wikipedia articles, except as hatnotes.)--&gt;

Blanchard (1996) and Zucker (2007) came to the general conclusion that birth order has some influence over sexual orientation in biological males in general, and homosexual male-to-female transsexuals in specific.&lt;ref name="Blanchardbrothers"&gt;{{Cite journal

Each older brother increases the odds that a male transsexual is homosexual by 40%."&lt;ref name="Greenbrothers"/&gt; Green did not find a higher incidence of homosexuality in the younger brothers of homosexual transsexuals.

Zucker and Blanchard wrote that studies have consistently supported the "fraternal birth order effect" that homosexual transsexuals have more brothers than sisters and are born later in birth order. In contrast, in their study using an Asian sample they found that the transsexual men had significantly more sisters than controls.&lt;ref name="Zuckerbrothers"/&gt; Zucker attributes this to the preference for males in Korean society causing parents to stop having children once they have a boy.&lt;ref name="Zuckerbrothers"/&gt; Therefore, all male children are less likely to have older brothers and hence no fraternal birth order effect is observed.&lt;ref name="Zuckerbrothers"/&gt; According to Bailey's interpretation of Blanchard's theory the causes of homosexual transsexuality are extreme examples of the causes of homosexuality in males.&lt;ref name="bailey2003"/&gt;

 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan (1978), Blanchard (1985), Lawrence (2005) and other researchers have asserted that many "non-homosexual" transsexuals systematically distort their life stories because "non-homosexuals" were often screened out as candidates for surgery&lt;ref name="morgan1978" /&gt; and because some see "homosexual transsexual" as a more socially desirable diagnosis. According to Blanchard (1985, 1987) key characteristics include conspicuous cross-gender behavior from childhood through adulthood, and a "[[homosexual]]" [[sexual orientation]].  Blanchard also says that non-homosexual transsexual women (as well as all other non-homosexual male gender dysphorics) have a condition called [[autogynephilia]] and are aroused by the idea or image of themselves as women.&lt;ref name="blanchard1987"/&gt;  Blanchard (1987) found in his studies that homosexual transsexuals were younger when applying for sex reassignment, reported a stronger cross-gender identity in childhood, had a more convincing cross-gender appearance, and functioned psychologically better than "non-homosexual" transsexuals.&lt;ref name="blanchard1987"&gt;Blanchard R, Clemmensen LH, Steiner BW (1987).

===Gynephilic female-to-male transsexuals===
In 2000 [[Meredith L. Chivers]] and Bailey wrote "Transsexualism in genetic females has previously been thought to occur predominantly in homosexual (gynephilic) women."  According to them Blanchard reported in 1987 that only one in 72 female-to-male transsexuals he saw at his clinic were primarily attracted to men. They write that these individuals were so uncommon that some researchers thought that androphilic female-to-male transsexuals did not exist or they were misdiagnosed them as homosexual transsexuals, attracted to women. Relatively few studies have examined childhood gender variance in biological females.&lt;ref name="chivers2000"/&gt;

In the 2005 study by Smith and van Goozen, their findings in regards to female-to-male transsexuals were different from their findings for male-to-female transsexuals.&lt;ref name="psychology Research"/&gt; Smith and van Goozen's study included 52 female-to-male transsexuals, who were categorized as either homosexual or non-homosexual. Smith concluded that female-to-male transsexuals, regardless of sexual orientation, reported more GID symptoms in childhood, and a stronger sense of gender dysphoria.  Smith wrote that she found some differences between homosexual and non-homosexual female-to-male transsexuals. Smith says that non-homosexual female-to-males reported more gender dysphoria than any group in her study. Smith says "It is of interest, though, that a few female-to-male transsexuals reported to have been sexually aroused in adolescence when dressing in male clothes, as this has never been reported before."&lt;ref name="psychology Research"/&gt;

==MRI studies and neurological differences==
The concept that androphilic male-to-female transsexualism is related to homosexuality in masculine homosexual males has been tested by MRI studies.&lt;ref name="Kozak"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=Lajos|author2=Lajos R.

A more precise recent study looked at the brains of homosexual aspiring transsexual males and females who reported to a gender clinic who had also not had any hormonal treatments.&lt;ref name=Kozak /&gt; The question the research wished to address was the existence of any differences between transsexual and non-transsexual brains. Wishing to avoid clouding the issue with a sample of mixed sexual orientations given Blanchard's theory was their stated reason for selecting homosexual transsexuals.  This study also controlled for possible influence of external hormones by looking at subjects who had not taken any yet.&lt;ref name=Kozak /&gt; The study found the following in its sample of homosexual transsexuals:

&lt;blockquote&gt; We found that transsexual subjects did not differ significantly from controls sharing their gender identity but were different from those sharing their biological gender in their regional GM volume of several brain areas, including the left and right precentral gyri, the left postcentral gyrus (including the somatosensory cortex and the primary motor cortex), the left posterior cingulate, precueneus and calcarinus, the right cuneus, the right fusiform, lingual, middle and inferior occipital, and inferior temporal gyri. Additionally, we also found areas in the cerebellum and in the left angular gyrus and left inferior parietal lobule that showed significant structural difference between transgender subjects and controls, independent from their biological gender.&lt;ref name=Kozak /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11385">'''Hunting with eagles''' is a traditional form of [[falconry]] found throughout the [[Eurasia]]n [[steppe]], practiced by [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] and [[Kyrgyz people]] in contemporary Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, as well as diasporas in [[Bayan-Ölgii Province|Bayan-Ölgii]], [[Mongolia]], and [[Xinjiang]], [[China]]. Though these [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people are most famous for hunting with [[golden eagles]], they have been known to train [[northern goshawk]]s, [[peregrine falcon]]s, [[saker falcon]]s, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keen|first1=Dennis|title=Kyrgyz Falconers Use Falcons, Too|url=http://centralasianfalconry.org/kyrgyz-falconers-use-falcons/|website=The Central Asian Falconry Project|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
In both [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], there are separate terms for those who hunt with birds of prey in general, and those who hunt with eagles.

In Kazakh, both ''qusbegi'' and ''sayatshy'' refer to falconers in general. ''Qusbegi'' comes from the words ''qus'' ("bird") and ''bek'' ("lord"), thus literally translating as "lord of birds." In [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]], ''kush begi'' was a title used for the [[khan (title)|khan]]'s most respected advisors, reflecting the valued role of the court falconer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Bosworth, C.

The Kazakh word for falconers that hunt with eagles is ''bürkitshi'', from ''bürkit'' ("golden eagle"), while the word for those that use goshawks is ''qarshyghashy'', from ''qarshygha'' ("goshawk").

In Kyrgyz, the general word for falconers is ''münüshkör''. A falconer who specifically hunts with eagles is a ''bürkütchü'', from ''bürküt'' ("golden eagle").

== History ==
[[Image:MongolHuntersSong.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Khitans]] eagle hunters on horse, ([[Song Dynasty]]).]]

=== Khitans ===
In 936-45 AD the [[Khitans]], a nomadic people from Manchuria, conquered part of north [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;The Art of War by Sun Tzu - Special Edition by Sun Tzu and Lionel Giles (2005) p.170&lt;/ref&gt; In 960 AD [[China]] was conquered by the [[Song dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;China: Its History and Culture (4th Edition) by W. Scott Morton, Charlton M. Lewis, and Charlton Lewis (2004) p.100&lt;/ref&gt; From its beginnings, the Song dynasty was unable to completely control the Khitan who had already assimilated much of Chinese culture. Throughout its 300-year rule of China, the [[Song]] had to pay tribute to the Khitan to keep them from conquering additional [[Song]] territory.&lt;ref&gt;5 Steps to a 5: AP World History (5 Steps to a 5) by Peggy Martin (2004) p.115&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the [[Khitans]] assimilated Chinese culture, they retained many nomadic traditions, including eagle hunting&lt;ref&gt;Eagle Dreams: Searching for Legends in Wild Mongolia by Stephen J. Bodio (2003) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; (see the unknown Chinese painting from [[Song]] dynasty).

===Jurchen===
Many [[Jurchen people|Jurchen tribes]] hunted the hai dong qing, the Khitan tried to take the eagle hunting for themselves by force, but it did not end in the Khitan's favour. The Jurchen started a revolt against them, which let them regain access to the hai dong qing that they hunted previously.

===Kyrgyz===
In 1207, the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] [[nomad]]s surrendered to [[Genghis Khan]]'s son [[Jochi]]. Under [[Mongol]] rule, the Kyrgyz preserved their nomadic culture as well as eagle falconry tradition until the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Soma, Takuya. 2007. ‘Kyrgyz Falconry &amp; Falconers and its Transition’.

===Kazakhs===
[[File:Kazakh-Mongolian Eagle Hunter.JPG|right|thumb|300px|[[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] eagle hunter in [[Altai Tavan Bogd National Park]], [[Mongolia]].]]

During the communist period in Kazakhstan, many [[Kazakhs]] fled for [[Mongolia]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/asia/kz.htm&lt;/ref&gt; settling in [[Bayan-Ölgii Province]] and bringing with them their tradition of hunting with eagles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3771">'''Invisible Battalion''' is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] advocacy campaign, a [[Sociology|sociological]] research group, and a [[civil rights]] project for [[Gender equality|gender equality]] in the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine]].

== Activities ==
It was launched in 2015 as a sociological survey conducted by the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]] sociologists on women's participation in [[War in Donbass|the war]] in the [[Eastern Ukraine|East of Ukraine]]&lt;ref name="uwf.org.ua"&gt;https://www.uwf.org.ua/files/invisible_batallion_eng_short.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. The survey revealed a number of problems: [[Legislation of Ukraine|Ukrainian legislation]] didn’t allow women to be assigned to combat positions, so they were enlisted as cooks, seamstresses, cleaners, accountants etc. while taking part in military combat operations as snipers, grenade launcher operators, reconnaissance soldiers, artillerists etc. This was done on semi-legal grounds. Thus, the majority of women who served in the war in Donbass were not enlisted officially and subsequently had no access to social or military benefits, military awards, social status, or career opportunities in the Armed Forces&lt;ref name="uwf.org.ua"/&gt;. 
With the support of Ukrainian Women's Fund and [[UN Women]], the ''Invisible Battalion'' survey turned into an ambitious photo project: about half a hundred portraits of Ukrainian women combatants were shot and exhibited at the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (Ukraine)|Ministry of Defense of Ukraine]].
In 2016 the Invisible Battalion year calendar won the Grand Prix at the National Festival of Social Advertising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uwf.org.ua/en/news/1142|title=Calendar "Invisible Battalion" won at the National Festival of Social Advertising|website=www.uwf.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Later on, the Invisible Battalion social project turned into a full-length [[documentary]] Invisible Battalion: six stories of six women who were (or are) combatants at war in the East of Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uacrisis.org/57284-nevidimij-bataljon|title=Invisible battalion: film about war in Donbas through Ukrainian women's eyes - UACRISIS.ORG|date=9 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Three women directors–[[Iryna Tsilyk]], Alina Gorlova, and Svitlana Lischynska–offer female perspectives on war that are bluntly honest. This documentary is a female account of war in the East of Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YBS1Hf6TvM|title=Trailer Invisible Battalion|first=|last=Марія Берлінська|date=7 November 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Accomplishments ==
Both as a result of the campaign, and the pressure of society and different international organizations the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine expanded the number of military jobs (63 in total) available to women (Directive #292 “On expanding military jobs for soldier, sergeant, and officer staff)&lt;ref&gt;http://zakon3.rada.gov.ua/laws/file/text/55/f428526n45.zip&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eca.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2016/10/women-are-changing-the-face-of-armed-forces-in-ukraine|title=Women are changing the face of armed forces in Ukraine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, even now {{frac|2|3}} of soldier and officer jobs are still unavailable to women. Moreover, women don’t have equal access to military education and careers.

Invisible Battalion is still fighting for the legal status of women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the civil rights of women veterans and other aspects of female involvement in the military.

'''Islam Said''' ([[Arabic]]: الإسلام سعيد), referred as '''Islam Chipsy,''' is a member of Egyptian electronic music group [[Dabke]], whose style incorporates elements of traditional Arabic wedding and electronic instruments. Their style is seen as part of a new wave of [[Shaabi]] music, referred to as Electro Shaabi or Mahraganat ([[Arabic language|Arabic:]] مهرجانات‎). 

== Career ==
Said plays the keyboard alongside two other band members, both drummers. They are collectively styled as "Islam Chipsy" and "EEK".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/14507-islam-chipsy-eek-interview|title=The Quietus {{!}} Features {{!}} Escape Velocity {{!}} The Revolutionary Party: Islam Chipsy Of EEK Interviewed|work=The Quietus|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://crackmagazine.net/article/long-reads/islam-chipsy-eek-cairos-power-trio/|title=Islam Chipsy &amp; EEK: Cairo's Power Trio {{!}} Crack Magazine|work=Crack Magazine|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said has been referred to as a "preternaturally talented keyboard player", with a unique style consisting of blasts of tone clusters deployed by alternately punching, slapping and karate-chopping his keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/oct/15/playlist-world-eek-islam-chipsy-souad-abdullah-maurice-louca-faycal-azizi|title=The playlist: Middle Eastern and North African – EEK &amp; Islam Chipsy, Souad Abdullah and more|last=Doran|first=John|date=2014-10-15|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Personal life ==
Said adopted the stage name ''Chipsy'' when another keyboardist with the same name began to take credit for his tracks.  Supposedly, since Said was frequently seen eating Chipsy (local brand of [[Lay's]] in Egypt), people started to refer to him by the name, and it stuck.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.madamasr.com/en/2014/04/01/feature/culture/band-of-the-week-islam-chipsy/|title=Band of the week: Islam Chipsy|work=Mada Masr|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He has become more prominent in Western media along with other Electro Chaabi artists such as Sadat, Figo and Alaa Fifty Cent, all coming from ''100COPIES'' label in Cairo, where Said signed an open contract in 2014.  

Said does not want to be associated with the Mahraganat movement, as it is very much based on [[Master of ceremonies|MCs]], and his genre is generally instrumental. His success has been propelled by the development of the Shabbi selection and deviates from its main patterns.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In Western countries, he has been aided by the spread and circulation of Middle Eastern music online. 

Said collaborates with Dubstep producers from the United Kingdom, such as Faze Miyake, Kode 9, Pinch, Mumdance and Artwork, as part of working with the [[British Council]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Jalaa''' (autonym: ''bàsàrə̀n dà jàlààbè̩''), also known as '''Cèntûm''',&lt;ref name="Blench2014"&gt;{{cite web|author=Blench, Roger|title=African language isolates|url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Africa/General/African%20language%20isolates.pdf|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Centúúm''' or '''Cen Tuum''', is an [[endangered language]] of northeastern [[Nigeria]] (Loojaa settlement in [[Balanga, Nigeria|Balanga]] Local Government Area, [[Bauchi State]]), of uncertain origins. It is nearly extinct and the [[Jalabe people|Jalabe]] (as speakers of the language are called) often use the Bwilim dialect of the [[Dikaka language]] in daily life, and the few remaining speakers of Jalaa, all elderly, are much more fluent in Dikaka than Jalaa.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Jalabe are said to have come to Loojaa from an area a few miles south within the Muri Mountains, where they had shared a settlement with Tso and Kwa clans. (The name of this settlement, Cèntûm or Cùntûm, is used as a name for the language in some sources.) Later, during the nineteenth century, the [[Dikaka language|Dikaka]] arrived in the area, fleeing attacks from the larger [[Waja languages|Waja]] to the north; the Cham intermarried with the Jalabe, and the Jalabe began to adopt the Dikaka language.

==Lexicon==
The Jalaa lexicon is also strongly influenced by Dikaka (which it has in turn influenced); some similarities are also found with the nearby [[Tso language|Tso]]. However, most of its vocabulary is extremely unusual. In Kleinewillinghöfer's words, "The major part of the lexicon seems to differ entirely from all the surrounding languages, which themselves represent different language families."

Both Dikaka and the Tso traditionally avoided using names of the dead. When those names were also words of the language, as often happened, this forced them to change the word, sometimes by replacing it with a word from a neighboring language. Kleinewillinghöfer regards this as a motivation for certain cases of borrowing from Jalaa into Dikaka.

===Numerals===

The numerals 1-6 in Jalaa are:

# ''násán''
# ''tiyú, tə́só''
# ''tətáá, bwànbí''
# ''təbwár, ŋbár''
# ''(tə)nó''
# ''tənúkùn''

Above 5, the numerals are almost identical to Dikaka. The numerals 2 through 5 are almost identical with Tso, while "one" has no clear cognates.

==Morphology==

Jalaa morphology (at least in its present form) is almost identical to that of [[Dikaka language|Cham]]. The main differences in the [[noun class]] system are two of the plural suffixes: Jalaa ''-ta'' versus Cham ''-te̩'' and (for humans) Jalaa ''-bo, -ba'' versus Cham ''-b(e̩)''.

'''Japanese Paraguayans''' ({{lang-es|Japonés Paraguayo}}, {{lang-ja|日系パラグアイ人}} ''Nikkei Paraguaijin'') are [[Paraguay]]ans of [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese ethnicity]].

==History==

Japanese immigration was not permitted by the Paraguayan government until the 20th century. The first [[Latin America]]n country that Japanese people settled was [[Brazil]]. But when Brazil decided to halt Japanese immigration in the 1930s, a Japanese land company built an agricultural settlement southeast of [[Asunción]]. Two more colonies near [[Encarnación, Paraguay|Encarnación]] followed in the 1950s; many Japanese settlers came from neighboring [[Bolivia]]. During [[World War II]], many Japanese Paraguayans were accused, alongside [[Germans of Paraguay|German Paraguayans]] and [[Italians in Paraguay|Italian]] Paraguayans. Until the end of World War II, many Japanese [[refugee]]s arrived. The Japanese and Paraguayan governments made a bilateral agreement in 1959 to continue Japanese settlement in Paraguay. Although most ethnic minorities chose urban life, Japanese remained in agriculture- there were 8,000 Japanese settlers in rural colonies in the 1980s. The remaining Japanese settlers who are living in urban areas number 2,321{{When|date=February 2011}}. In spite of the long period of Japanese settlement in the country, there was a strong [[Social stigma|stigma]] against Japanese-Paraguayan intermarriage, but a number of Japanese Paraguayans are [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]] of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and Japanese descent or of other European (mostly [[germans in Paraguay|German]] or [[Italians|Italian]]) and Japanese descent.

==Language==

By the late 1960s to present, Japanese Paraguayans speak Japanese, Spanish, and Guaraní. The earliest settlement supported a parallel educational system with subjects taught entirely in Japanese; the colonists eventually limited this to supplemental Japanese-language classes.

==Religion==

First-generation Japanese Paraguayans were generally followers of Shinto and Buddhism. The first Japanese settlers at La Colmena brought a piece of stone from the [[Ise Shrine]] which was gazetted as a monument mark the settlement's founding. Japanese religious festivals were celebrated within the first few decades among the first and second-generation Japanese settlers, and in the late 1960s a majority identified themselves with the Buddhist and Shinto faiths. Conversion to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Christianity increased from the late 1970s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Masterson/Funada-Classen (2004), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
There is a [[Nihonjin gakko|Japanese international school]] in [[Asunción]]: the ''Colegio Japonés en Asunción'' (アスンシオン日本人学校 ''Asunshion Nihonjin Gakkō'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.jp/coljap2/ Home page].

'''Kenyan Australians''' are [[Australian]] citizens and residents of [[Kenyan]] origin and descent. They may be of indigenous African, European, or Indian heritage.&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF |title=Community Information Summary: Kenya-born (2011 census) |url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/comm-summ/_pdf/kenya.pdf |work=Department of Immigration &amp; Citizenship |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212100612/http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/comm-summ/_pdf/kenya.pdf |archivedate=12 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Uncertainties about the future of colonial-run Kenya prompted many Kenyan-born settlers of both European and Indian backgrounds to migrate to other countries, including Australia. There are also many Swahili-speaking Kenyans of indigenous African ancestry.&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au"/&gt; The majority of such migrants had no difficulty getting work and settling into the Australian community.&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au"/&gt;

The majority of Kenyan Australians are skilled and educated, with 72.5% of the Kenyan-born aged 15 years and over possessing higher non-school qualifications, compared to 55.9% of the Australian population.&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au"/&gt;

==Population==
The 2011 Census noted there are 13,832 Kenya-born people in Australia.&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au"/&gt; About one in five Australians who claim Kenyan ancestry live in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;2006 Census&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
The languages most commonly spoken at home by Kenyan-born Australians are English and Swahili, however Gujurati, Dinka and other languages are not uncommon.&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au"/&gt; Kikuyu is a Kenyan language spoken by over one hundred Australians at home, and Luo is also spoken by about one hundred Australians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|format=PDF|title=The People of Australia: Statistics from the 2011 Census|url=http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/publications/LocalGovernment/The_People_of_Australia.pdf|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Immigration and Border Protection|year=2014|isbn=978-1-920996-23-9|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529194052/http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/publications/LocalGovernment/The_People_of_Australia.pdf|archivedate=29 May 2014|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 5,000 Kenyan-born Australians speak a language indigenous to Africa at home.&lt;ref name="sbs.com.au"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/censusexplorer/|title=SBS Census Explorer|work=SBS Online|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the over 10,700 Australian-born who speak an African language may also speak a language of Kenya.&lt;ref name="sbs.com.au"/&gt;

The 74 languages the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] broadcasts in includes [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Dinka language|Dinka]], both languages spoken by many Kenyan-born Australians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2012/12/01/sbs-unveils-new-radio-schedule|title=SBS unveils new Radio Schedule|work=SBS News|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hyundai.Universe.Bloodmobile.jpg|thumb|A [[Hyundai Universe]] bloodmobile of Korean Red Cross]]
The '''Republic of Korea National Red Cross''' (more commonly known as the '''Korean Red Cross''') is a [[humanitarian]] organization that provides emergency assistance, disaster relief and education inside [[South Korea]]. It is the designated South Korean affiliate of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]].

==History==
When [[Emperor Kojong]] promulgated a decree to proclaim the formation of the Korean Red Cross in 1905, the society was founded in [[Seoul]]. The organization was recognized by the [[International Federation of Red Cross|International Red Cross Society]] in 1955 and became a member of the [[International Life Saving Federation]] (I.L.S.F) on Saturday 11 November 1995. The institution has contributed to not only the dissemination of health-related skills and knowledge, but also to the protection of public health since 1949.

==Activity==
'''''All activities are based on fundamental activity of Red Cross (activity in Korea)'''''
* Therapy to relief work of the victim and prisoners of [[Korean War]] as military medical institution by Red Cross renegotiation. (negotiation about the prisoner in armistice talks, 1952)
* Aid for sufferers who get problem such as cataclysm, disease, emergency and many problems. (accident about collapse of [[Seongsu Bridge]] in 1994, collapse of [[Sampoong Department Store]] in 1995)

The '''Kurya''' (also known as '''AbaKurya''', as they prefer to call themselves) are a community of [[Bantu people|Bantu]] people who inhabit [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]].

==History of the Abakurya and the origin of the name 'Kurya'==
{{Copypaste|section|url=http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/68766|date=June 2015}}
The people now known as AbaKurya are of diverse origins and clans. Before the twentieth century, they did not refer to themselves as the AbaKurya but by their various clans, or by the "provinces" from which they came.
The Kurya people known as the Abakurya live astride the Kenyan-Tanzanian border and in [[South Nyanza]] on the Kenyan side. They are divided into clans (''ibiaro'') which some researchers refer to as sub-tribes, but they are not real sub-tribes as the differences among the clans are minor. The laws and practices are the same and the language is also the same among all clans with minor variations.

Each clan inhabits a geographically defined area, that is, the clans are localised. Each clan is divided into sub-clans called ''ibisaku''; into generation-sets known as ''amakora'' of which there are only eight (8) and the same in all clans; and into age-sets referred to as ''ichisaro''. Every clan has its own council of elders (''inchama'') who controlled the clan (''ikiaro'', singular) as political and religious leaders. The Abakurya believed in taboos and superstition and they generally feared punishment from the ''inchama'' for not observing the taboos. The punishment could be either death or barrenness or other misfortunes. The Abakurya customary law is made up of rules and practices accepted and sanctioned by the community. The custom had many do's and don'ts (taboos/superstitions) called ''imigiro''. Even the marriage laws were full of taboos and superstition and there was automatic punishment for breaking these ''imigiro''. Hence the laws were followed so strictly both before and after [[colonization]], because after colonization the Abakurya went back to their original life and were not influenced by [[westernization]].

Their strictness made Abakurya marriages (''oboteti'') binding to the extent that divorce was something almost impossible. Their marriage was potentially polygamous like any other customary marriage in Kenya. Marriage was valued very much, as one way of family sustenance and continuation. As such everybody had to marry and get married. Even for someone who was naturally incapable of marrying on his own like the lunatic, the dead, the cripple (''irigata'') among others, there was a way of ensuring that there was a wife in his name. There was also a way of caring for the barren or childless through marriage so that their houses would not be extinguished. There was no singlehood as a marital status to adults and as such even the divorcees had to remarry and every man had to marry in order to establish his own home (''umugi goe''). Also every woman had to be married to establish her own house (''inyumba yae''). ''Umugi'' and ''inyumba'' had to be sustained, that is, had to continue growing at whatever cost. All these factors led to certain marriages like ghost marriages, female to female (''busino'') and others. The stigma and disregard attached to divorcees, and given the fact that everyone had to marry, made people stick to their marriages however frustrating or bad some of them were.

==Abakurya in the Present Day==
The homeland of the Abakurya is between River Migori to the east and the eastuary of River Mara to the west. The area stretches from Migori District, Kenya on the east to Musoma District, Tanzania on the west. To the south their land borders Transmara District in Kenya and the Nguruimi area in Tanzania. To the north is Lake Victoria, with a small corridor occupied by the Luo and some other Bantu peoples.

The Abakurya are found both in Kenya and Tanzania. In Kenya they live in Kurya East (headquartered in Kegonga) and Kurya West districts (headquartered in Kehancha). In Tanzania they live in Serengeti, Tarime, Musoma town, Musoma rural, Bunda and some parts of Mwanza districts. Mara as a province in Northern Tanzania has mostly been occupied by the Abakurya since recent times.

The immediate neighbours of the Abakurya are the Maasai, Kalenjin (Kipsigis clan in Transmara west), Ikoma, Luo and Suba.

Socially, The Abakurya are divided into several clans which live both in Kenya and in Tanzania.
In Kenya, there are 4 clans found: the Abagumbe, Abairege, Abanyabasi and Abakira. In Tanzania there are 13: the Abapemba, Ababurati, Abakira, Abamera, Simbete, Abanyabasi, Watobori, Abakunta, Wiga, Kaboye, Abakenye, Abagumbe and  Wasweta, Abatimbaru, with other minor clans.

The Abakurya are traditionally a farming community, mainly planting maize, beans and cassava as food crops. The cash crops grown include coffee and maize. Tobacco has over time been phased as a cash crop among the people. The Kurya also keep cattle and in times past, this used to lead to inter-clan and/or intertribal clashes over cattle rustling.

==Origin of the name 'Kurya'==
The name Kurya seems to have been applied to the whole group by the early colonial chiefs mainly to distinguish them from the other Luoised groups along the southern shores of Lake Victoria who were known as Abasuba (a name which at times also  included the Abakurya proper).  
 
The Abagusii state that their ancestors originally came from "Misiri" and that they migrated with the ancestors of the Abakurya, Abalogoli, Ababukusu, and Abasuba and that they lost contact with these people in the Mount Elgon area. The Abagusii and Abalogoli followed river Nzoia Valley which eventually took them to the northern shores of Lake Victoria probably between AD 1500 and 1560. At this early stage there  doesn't seem to have been significant differences between the Abagusii, Abakurya, Abalogoli and Abasuba among others. Their distinctive names and identities appear to have developed much later when they had separated into their present homelands.The origin of the name Kurya is a thorny point in Abakurya history. The major Abakurya sub-tribes such as Abanyabasi, Abatimbaru, Abanyamongo, Abakira, Abairegi, Abakenye,Abanchaari, and Abagumbe have  traditions to the effect that their ancestor was Mokurya (or Mukurya) who lived in   "Misiri". His descendants migrated from "Misiri" and after many years of wandering on the other  side of Lake Victoria, they eventually reached and settled in the present Bukurya.
 
According to this tradition, the Abakurya have been divided from time immemorial into two 
families: the Abasai of the elder wife of Mokurya and the Abachuma of the younger wife. But this 
tradition does not explain how the Abakurya people got their generation sets, such as Maina, 
Nyambiriti, Gamnyeri on the Abasai side, and Mairabe (Norongoro), Gini, Nyangi on the 
Abachuma side. These generation set names are also found among other people such as the 
Ababukusu, Kalenjin, Agikuyu, Aembu/Ambeere and Ameru. It is therefore most probable that 
the early Abakurya people who brought the generation set system into Abakurya society were a 
splinter group from a much larger community living in the area of Mount Elgon from which the 
Kalenjin people, a section of the Ababukusu and the Agikuyu clusters emerged. Paul Aseka Abuso 
in his book A Traditional History of the Abakurya has written thus: Abakurya section of the Abagumbe, Abapemba, Abaasi and Abasonga also state in their tradition that they travelled together with the ancestors of the Kikuyu among other people from Misiri to 
Lake Baringo in the Kenya Rift Valley where they finally separated. Although Kikuyu history 
does not corroborate this point it looks as if at one time the ancestors of these people originally 
lived together in some area north of Mount Elgon. Perhaps the people known as Sirikwa mentioned above were part of that larger ancestral community — or possibly their descendants. 
This is not yet clear.

The other view of the origin of the name Kurya is as follows. Between about 1774 and 1858, some 
of the Abakurya people were living in Musoma district in the present Tanzania and were settled 
in a hilly area north of the River Mara then known as Korea hill. The inhabitants of that area in 
time became known as Korea people after the name of the hill, which eventually changed to 
Kurya hill whereby the people became known as the Abakurya. The divergent views on the origin 
of the name would explain why the name had not gained wide acceptance among the Abakurya 
even at the beginning of the last century, as people still largely identified themselves by the sub-group names. During the colonial period, it was the name Abatende (after the Abatende clan in Bugumbe area) rather than Abakurya, which was in common use among the Kenya Abakurya. 
Those living in Tanzania continued to be known by their totems. It is only in about the 1950s that 
the name Abakurya gained wide usage. In a similar manner the Mijikenda, Abaluyia and Kalenjin 
became generally accepted as collective ethnic names in the 1940s and 1950s, at a time when in 
Kenya they were seeking political recognition by the colonial authorities.

The Abakurya people appear to have sprung from too many directions to have a common 
historical origin, although a number of clans claim to have come from Egypt. The culture of the 
present Abakurya therefore is an amalgam of many different cultures which may originally have 
been opposed to each other in content and practice. Among the Abakurya today are found people 
who were originally from the Kalenjin, Maasai, Bantu and Luo speaking communities. 
 
Between AD 1400 and 1800 when migrations into Bukurya took place, the foundation was laid for 
the future Abakurya cultural and political developments. Early inhabitants of Bukurya came from 
both Bantu and Nilotic speakers who brought into Bukurya their peculiar cultures. Predominantly 
agricultural Bantu came into close contact with predominantly Nilotic pastoralists. Thus a blend 
of cultures took place among the early inhabitants of Bukurya from the start by combining 
agricultural practice with pastoral pursuit as well as tendencies towards nomadic life. Today 
elements of Abakurya agriculture is much like that of the Abagusii and the Luo while in cattle 
keeping they have borrowed the practices of the Maasai, Zanaki and Nguruimi. 
 
Before the population had increased very much, it appears that a number of the Abakurya 
communities developed independently without many interactions with the others. Many of those 
who lived at the foothills of such places as Gutura, Maheta and Gwasi tended to carry on with 
their mode of life as if there were no other people around them. During the seventeenth and the 
eighteenth centuries, more and More immigrants settled into the region and whether they liked it 
or not, the earlier communities were forced to interact with the new arrivals or at any rate to 
confront them. Some of the newcomers were aggressive and would not let their neighbours live 
in peace as they engaged in raiding for cattle and at times fought for dominance in the region. 
This meant that the small family clusters that had hitherto lived peacefully in the region shifted 
location and internal migration and resettlements were a continuous and repetitive process 
within and around Bukurya. In this way new social groups were formed. Many of these new 
societies were often swelled by splinter groups running away from other broken-up communities as a result of disruptions of war and raids. The Abamerani, for example, are said to have 
swallowed up many other clans.

In 2006 the Kurya population was estimated to number 909,000, with 608,000 living in Tanzania and 301,000 in Kenya. The latest (2012) anthropological research estimate the population of the Abakurya in Kenya to be about 650,000 and those of Tanzania to about 700,000.

The Kurya people were mainly pastoralists in the pre-colonial era but currently the Kenyan kuryans lean towards crop production and the Tanzanian Kuryans learn more towards pastoralism. The Abakurya are said to have abandoned Pastrolism after they were forced to do so by the Germans when they landed in the modern-day Northern Tanzania. The Kuryans in the Serengeti district are distinctly pastoralist. Details on how Abakurya started crop production and abandoned pastrolism will be available as a researcher is currently working on the same.

The Kurya are closely related to the Kisii people of Kenya both in language and physique among other cultural practices and beliefs.

The Kurya are closely related to the Kisii people of Kenya both in language and physique among other cultural practices and beliefs.

==Ancestor names (ichindoko)==
Kurya also name their children after the names of the ancestors (Abhakoro). Such naming will occur if the wish of the dead grandfather or mother requested to be named a boy or girl. That is why there is mwita for both girls and boys. Some for sake of love one would like to name the ancestors as a sign that the ancestor has been reborn. A child can have two names, one for obhotangi and another for endoko. For example, a boy can have one name from being a firstborn, and another name after his great-grandfather. The other cause of naming ancestors will result when the child is sick or misfortunes come to a family and they seek omogabho/omoraguli to find out the problem. The omoraguli will advise to name a child an ancestor whose spirits have been troubled by the family. When naming the child, the family will be required to sacrifice (kumwensa) a goat or a cow depending on the wish of the spirits and the magnitude of the problem. Similarly names like Nyamohanga, Ryoba, Magaigwa, Nsato, Sabure, Wankuru, Ng’oina, Wanchoka, Mwikwabhe are named after the spirits. That is why when Kuryas were baptized their native names were rejected because they were assumed to be associated with the spirits (Evil spirits?).

==Wakurya generations (Amakora)==

Wakurya have developed a generation system which place every individual in a generation group.  There are two sets of generations

The first set is called Monyasae and the other is Monyachuma.

The Monyasae has a four circle generations as follows:

:Abasae—Abanyamburiti—Abagamnyeri—Abamaina

The Monyachuma has also four circle generations as follows:

:Abachuma—Abangorongoro—Abagini—Abanyangi

The generations identifies an individual in the Kurya society. For example, a child of a Mosae from the monyasae generation circle will be a munyamburiti and will give forth to Omogamunyeri.  No one is allowed to marry a child of the same generation.  One generation circle is considered to last 25 years.  A complete generation circle is hundred yearS. By knowing your  generation you can easily calculate the age of your parents and grandparents.  In the case of a mugamunyeri, his or her father is a Mnyamburiti.

By using the generation system you can even know when a major event took place by associating the event and those who witnessed the event if their generation is known e.g. Uhuru, Second World War etc.

== Circumcision ==
Change from childhood to adulthood is an important Kurya ritual which transform individual to another stage of life. The change known as ''saro'' is a passage to adulthood. Every boy or girl must pass through ''saro'' to be recognised as an adult; otherwise, he is ''Mulisya'' or ''Mosagane''.

When one is circumcised he/she is placed into an age-set (''esaro''). It is not the purpose of this issue to describe the circumcision process but to emphasise the importance of the ritual. In Kurya society one is recognised by the age set group. All people circumcised at the same time are given an age set (''saro''). When a girl is married her age set group is changed to that of the husband if their ''saro'' are different. No one is allowed to marry children of same ''saros'', All ceremonies are done on the basis of ''saro'' or ''amakora''. One will not be allowed to marry or married if he has not gone through circumcision. In modern times boys are circumcised in hospitals and it is slowly being accepted but looked down as an inferior process. A real ''mkurya'' should face a ''mosali'' get circumcised without a wink.

Traditionally, circumcision was done at the age around 13 years, but this differed significantly from one clan to another. The Abairege had most of their men circumcised at 15–18 years and above. However, this has changed to the onset of puberty. To this date, various organisations are working to ensure the tradition of female genital mutilation is aborted. Also, due to increased spread of HIV/AIDS organisations advocate for care during circumcision rituals. Many families are opting to take their children to hospitals and the traditional circumcision experts have now opted to use individual razors for each person during circumcision. After the cut, the boys or girls that have undergone the practice are normally led back home by fellow villagers amidst singing and dancing and money is pinned onto their ''shukas''. The ''shukas'' are one-piece coloured sheets that the circumcised tie around themselves so as to let the blood drip freely to the ground. Once circumcision has taken place, according to tradition, the boy or girl is deemed ready for marriage.

'''Kwakum''' (ISO [kwu]) is classified as belonging to the Bantu subgroup A90 (Kaka) of the Zone “A” Bantu languages, and specifically labelled A91 by Guthrie&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, Malcolm. 1953. ''The Bantu languages of western equatorial Africa''. London: Oxford University Press. &lt;/ref&gt;. According to one of the newest updates to the Bantu classification system,&lt;ref&gt;Maho, Jouni. 2003. A classification of the Bantu languages: An update of Guthrie’s referential system. In Derek Nurse &amp; Gérard Philippson (eds.), ''The Bantu languages'', 639–651. London: Routledge. &lt;/ref&gt; other languages belonging to this subgroup are: Pol (A92a), Pɔmɔ (A92b), Kweso (A92C) and Kakɔ (A93). The Kwakum people refer to themselves (and their language) as either Kwakum or Bakoum (sometimes spelled Bakum). However, they say that the "Bakoum" pronunciation only began after the arrival of Europeans in Cameroon, though it is frequently used today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diu.edu/documents/theses/Hare_David-thesis.pdf|title=Tense in Kwakum Narrative Discourse|last=Hare|first=David|date=June 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kwakum is mainly spoken in the East region of Cameroon, southwest of the city Bertoua. 

== Dialects ==
Kwakum is listed by Simons &amp; Fennig&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/kwu|title=Kwakum|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as having three dialects: Til, Beten (or Mbeten, or Petem), and Baki (or Mbaki). According to David Hare&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, there are two main districts in which Kwakum is spoken: Dimako and Doumé. The Dimako district has 8 villages centered around the town of Dimako. The Doumé district has 8 villages centered around the town of Doumé. The lexical similarity between the Kwakum spoken in these two districts is 92.3%. Among these villages are the two villages of Baktala and Longtimbi. The people who live in these villages consider themselves to be Kwakum, but also call themselves Til. There is a lexical similarity of 91.4% between the Kwakum spoken in the Dimako district and the language spoken in the Til villages.

There are four villages of people who consider themselves to be Mbeten (and not Kwakum). The lexical similarity between the Kwakum of the Dimako district and the Mbeten villages is 81.3%. The Mbaki live far from the Kwakum and the lexical similarity is only 47.7%. It is thus unlikely that Mbaki should be considered a dialect of Kwakum.

== Tone ==
Kwakum is a tonal language, and has been analyzed by Stacey Hare as having three tones.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diu.edu/documents/theses/Hare_Stacey-thesis.pdf|title=Tone in Kwakum (A91) with an application to orthography|last=Hare|first=Stacey|date=June 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Literature ==
The first analysis of Kwakum was completed in 2005 by François Belliard.&lt;ref&gt;Belliard, François. 2005. ''Instruments, chants et performances musicales chez les Kwakum de l'arrondissement de Doume (est-Cameroun) : Étude ethnolinguistique de la conception musicale d'une population de langue Bantu A91''. Paris: Institut National des Langues et Civilisations Orientales PhD dissertation. &lt;/ref&gt; Though this work focused on the music of the Kwakum, there is a brief description of the phonology and grammar. This dissertation was simplified into the form of a book entitled ''Parlons Kwakum'' (Let's Speak Kwakum) and published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.intercommunications.be/fr/parlons/73311-parlons-kw%C3%A0k%C3%B9m-9782296038417.html|title=Parlons Kwàkùm - InterCommunications|website=www.intercommunications.be|language=fr-fr|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both works by Belliard are only available in French. 

David Hare completed an MA thesis entitled Tense in Kwakum Narrative Discourse in June 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Stacey Hare wrote her MA thesis on Tone in Kwakum (A91) with an application to orthography.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Elisabeth Njantcho Kouagang wrote a doctoral dissertation entitled A grammar of Kwakum in 2018 as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theses.fr/s105027|title=A grammar of Kwakum|last=KOUAGANG|first=Elisabeth NJANTCHO|date=2018-07-06|website=www.theses.fr|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three works are only available in English.

Sweeney develops technology to assess and solve societal problems and teaches others how to use the same technology. She has made several discoveries related to identifiability and privacy technologies. Her work has received awards from numerous organizations, including the [[American Psychiatric Association]], the [[American Medical Informatics Association]], and the [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association]]. Her work was praised in the TAPAC Report that reviewed the Total Information Awareness Project of [[DARPA]]. She has testified before the Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and the European Union Commission. Sweeney  was a Distinguished Career Professor of Computer Science, Technology and Policy in the School of Computer Science at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. In 2001, she received her PhD in computer science from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where she became the first [[African American]] woman to earn a PhD in computer science from that school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/05/new-faculty-deans-appointed/|title=New faculty deans appointed|date=9 May 2016|website=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her undergraduate degree in computer science was completed at Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biographical sketches of Latanya Sweeney|url=http://dataprivacylab.org/people/sweeney/bio.html|publisher=Data Privacy Lab, Harvard University|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweeney went to Dana Hall Schools in [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]], MA, where she received her high school diploma in 1977. She delivered the valedictory at the graduation ceremony.

Sweeney did undergraduate studies at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)]], where she focused on Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

She went to [[Harvard Extension School]] to study Computer Science, where she received an ALB degree (Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies) in Computer Science, Cum Laude. Her undergraduate research thesis was called “A Coin Toss: the Dialectical Odds Aren't Always 50/50”. She received honors grades in all courses and completed graduate courses in computer science, mathematics, physics, educational psychology, and philosophy. She also delivered the graduation speech.

Sweeney returned to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to study for her master degree, where she received an S.M. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1997. During her studying of master degree, she received a GPA of 4.9/5.0. Sweeney wrote a Master's thesis called “Sprees, a Finite-State Orthographic Learning System that Recognizes and Generates Phonologically Similar Spellings”, where she was the finalist in MasterWorks. She continued to study at MIT for her Ph.D. degree, where she advanced in Computer Science. She received the degree in 2001 and finished her Ph.D. thesis “Computational Disclosure Control: Theory and Practice”.

== Career and Research ==
In 2001, Sweeney became director and founder of the [[Data Privacy Lab]], at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. She was a member of the Program Committee for Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence (MDAI) in 2005. In 2004, she founded the Journal of Privacy Technology, later becoming the editor-in-chief in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latanyasweeney.org/bio.html|title=Biographical sketches of Latanya Sweeney, Ph.D.|website=latanyasweeney.org|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her PhD dissertation at [[MIT]] (Computational Disclosure Control: Theory and Practice), Sweeney examines various computational methodologies for the secure dissemination of anonymous data without revealing any identifying, or potentially identifying, information. She proposes novel approaches for secure data disclosure, defining and describing null-map, k-map and wrong-map models of protection. Sweeney then critiques and compares four electronic data-based computational programs on their capacity to protect private information. The systems evaluated are her Scrub System, her Datafly II System, Statistics Netherlands’ u-Argus System, and her k-Similar algorithm – which she concludes as the most effective system in minimizing privacy risks. Prior to her dissertation, Sweeney has already been published numerous times, in topics pertaining to healthcare data security, and she has also completed a Masters Thesis at MIT and a ALB Thesis at Harvard. Currently, Sweeney is a prominent data security researcher and continues ongoing work to advance this field.

[https://techscience.org/a/2015103001/ Who Knows What About Me? A Survey of behind the Scenes Personal Data Sharing to Third Parties by Mobile Apps.]

By conducting research on 110 mobile apps over 9 categories (including business, games, fitness &amp; health etc.), Sweeney found that many mobile apps transmits sensitive personal data to third-party domains, particularly name, location and email etc. According to her study, [[Android (operating system)|Android]] apps send potential sensitive personal data to 3.1 third-party domains. As for [[App Store (iOS)|iOS apps]], they connected with an average of 2.6 third party domains. While increasing bringing up awareness for current risks for privacy leakage, Sweeney also inspires us to think about possible future sharing permission system on mobile phones.

In 2016 L. Sweeny, M. Bar-Sinai, M. Crosas, introduced Data Tags, Data Handling Policy Spaces and the Tags Language in IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops 2016 in San Jose CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sweeney|first=Latanya|last2=Bar-Sinai|first2=Michael|date=May 2016|title=Data Tags, Data Handling Policy Spaces and the Tags Language|url=|journal=IEEE 2016 Security and Privacy Workshops|volume=|pages=1–8|doi=10.1109/SPW.2016.11|via=IEEE Explore}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper introduces the Tags programming language and toolset which through questionnaires suggests data handling policies appropriate to the level of security the dataset requires.  The Tags Language and Tools simplifies the development of security policies by recommending policies that meet the legal requirements for that dataset, like HIPAA.

=== Early Publication and Challenges ===
In 1997, Sweeney conducted her first re-identification experiment wherein she successfully identified then Massachusetts governor, William Weld to his medical records using publicly accessible records. Her results had a significant impact on privacy centered policymaking including the health privacy legislation HIPAA, however publication of the experiment was rejected twenty times. The several re-identification experiments she conducted after this were met with serious publication challenges as well. In fact, a court ruling in Southern Illinoisian v. Department of Public Health barred her from publication and sharing of her methods for a successful re-identification experiment. Fear of publicly exposing a serious issue with no known solution fueled majority of the backlash against publication of her works and similar re-identification experiments for over a decade. Unless experiments concluded that no risk existed or that the issue could be resolved through reasonable technological advancement, publication was largely denied.

In her article “[https://techscience.org/a/2015092903/ Only You, Your Doctor, and Many Others May Know],” writer Latanya Sweeney discusses her research project in which she located and matched up identities and personal health records through a number of methods. Such methods, as she explains in depth later on, include looking at public health records from hospitals and newspaper stories. Towards the end of the article, Sweeney touches upon the different approaches of how she analyzed and matched the data, either through using computer programs or human effort. She then makes the conclusion that new and improved methods of data sharing are necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sweeney|first=Latanya|date=2015-09-29|title=Only You, Your Doctor, and Many Others May Know|url=https://techscience.org/a/2015092903/|journal=Technology Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011 Sweeney’s Data Privacy Lab has been conducting research about data privacy at Harvard. It intends to provide a cross-disciplinary perspective about privacy in the process of disseminating data. The Data Privacy Lab is sponsored by government, corporate, and nonprofit organizations. It is also in partnership with Berkman Klein Center, the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Center for Research on Computation and Society, and Program on Informational Sciences. One of her missions of the Data Privacy Lab includes creating a conversation about data in technology and policies on protecting personal data in technology.  Sweeney’s Data Privacy Lab is working on 102 different projects regarding data privacy. Some of which include: The Genomic Privacy Project, Discrimination in Online Ad Delivery Project, Privacy-Enhanced Linking Project, and the Identifiability Project. The Genomic Privacy Project attempts to question the privacy of our genetic code and the use of genetic code to identify individuals. The Discrimination in Online Delivery Project examines the possibility of discrimination in the type of ads that show up in a search on a particular individual. There is a possibility that some searches will yield ads that are discriminatory to racial minorities. The Privacy-Enhanced Linking Project attempts to create algorithms in computer coding that will automatically protect privacy in the process of linking—which is the chain of searches that can be traced. The Identifiability Project examines how individuals can be identified through the use public census data. She argues that individuals can be identified using population census data through the combination of zip code, gender, and date of birth.

A '''mental timeline''' is a mental representation of time that is spatial in nature. The mental timeline is similar to the mental [[number line]] where numbers are perceived increasing left to right. 
&lt;br&gt;

Earlier time periods (the past) are associated with the left side of space and later time periods (the future) with the right. It is typically thought of as being presented left to right for populations who read left to right (e.g. English) and right to left for populations who read right to left (e.g. Arabic).

==Rationale==
One rationale behind the connection between time and space is that space is an easier concept to understand than time. Space is three dimensional and can be perceived directly using visual sensors, that is, we can physically see a space. In contrast time is one dimensional and can only be perceived indirectly, for example, by seeing that a person has aged, we can infer that time has passed however we do not physically see time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weger|first1=Ulrich W.|last2=Pratt|first2=Jay|title=Time flies like an arrow: Space-time compatibility effects suggest the use of a mental timeline|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date=4 December 2013|volume=15|issue=2|pages=426–430|doi=10.3758/PBR.15.2.426}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many other examples of spatial representations of time around the world such as clocks, calendars and hourglasses. 

This reasoning is also given for the use of [[conceptual metaphor|spatial metaphors]] connecting the intangible concept of time with a more solid concept of space. Spatial metaphors such as, ‘there’s a big day ahead’ or ‘put the past behind you’ are common colloquialisms that represent the idea of a mental timeline. They provide linguistic evidence that our cognitive perception of time is linked to our representation of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eikmeier|first1=Verena|last2=Schröter|first2=Hannes|last3=Maienborn|first3=Claudia|last4=Alex-Ruf|first4=Simone|last5=Ulrich|first5=Rolf|title=Dimensional overlap between time and space|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date=19 April 2013|volume=20|issue=6|pages=1120–1125|doi=10.3758/s13423-013-0431-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boroditsky|first1=Lera|title=Metaphoric structuring: understanding time through spatial metaphors|journal=Cognition|date=April 2000|volume=75|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(99)00073-6|pmid=10815775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
===Linguistic evidence===
Evidence the mental timeline can be seen in experiments such as Santiago, Lupianez, Perez and Funes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Santiago|first1=Julio|last2=Lupáñez|first2=Juan|last3=Pérez|first3=Elvira|last4=Funes|first4=María Jesús|title=Time (also) flies from left to right|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date=June 2007|volume=14|issue=3|pages=512–516|doi=10.3758/BF03194099}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participant was shown a list of words categorized into the past or the future on either the left or the right of a computer screen. They were asked to respond by pushing a button either on the left or the right of the keyboard. In the first half of the experiment the left button meant past and right meant future, in the second half these were switched to mean the opposite. The study found that participants responded faster if the response key was aligned with the mental timeline. That is, the participant was faster to respond when the left key was aligned with the past and the right key with the future. This effect mimics the [[spatial-numerical association of response codes |spatial-numerical association of response codes (SNARC)]] that is shown when testing for the mental number line. 

===Non-linguistic evidence===
Evidence for this effect has also been shown using non-linguistic stimuli. Fuhrman and Boroditsky ran a similar experiment to the one described above but with pictorial cues rather than linguistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fuhrman|first1=Orly|last2=Boroditsky|first2=Lera|title=Cross-Cultural Differences in Mental Representations of Time: Evidence From an Implicit Nonlinguistic Task|journal=Cognitive Science|date=November 2010|volume=34|issue=8|pages=1430–1451|doi=10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01105.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;Participants were shown pictures of a banana at three time points, unopened or ‘earlier’, half-peeled or ‘middle’ and empty banana peel or ‘later’. Again, participants were asked to respond by pushing a button either on the left or the right of the keyboard. The results showed the same effect as before, where response times were faster when the key was aligned with the direction of the mental timeline. 

===Evidence in the visually impaired===
The effect of the mental timeline does not appear to be reliant on visual experience. An experiment using [[braille]] showed that blind participants had the same left to right mental timeline as sighted participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hendricks|first1=Rose K.|last2=Boroditsky|first2=Lera|title=Constructing mental time without visual experience|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=August 2015|volume=19|issue=8|pages=429–430|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2015.06.011|issn=1364-6613}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought to be due to the fact that both the sighted and blind participants, in this case, read left to right.

==The effect of visual neglect==

There is evidence that patients with left [[hemispatial neglect]] ignore the left side of the mental timeline. Saj, Fuhrmann, Boroditsky conducted an experiment where patients with left spatial neglect were measured against controls in remembering pictorial cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saj|first1=Arnaud|last2=Fuhrman|first2=Orly|last3=Vuilleumier|first3=Patrik|last4=Boroditsky|first4=Lera|title=Patients With Left Spatial Neglect Also Neglect the “Left Side” of Time|journal=Psychological Science|date=November 2013|volume=25|issue=1|pages=207–214|doi=10.1177/0956797612475222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cues were pictures of food that a fictional character ‘David’ liked to eat. Foods David liked to eat in the past were shown with a white cap above them, while foods he will like to eat in the future were shown with a black top hat above them. The results showed that the participants with neglect recalled fewer items coded to the past and mislabelled more past items as future items than the control group. This suggests that the left side of time (the past) was neglected much like the patients have visual neglect of the left side giving more evidence to the use of the mental timeline.

'''Miss Tibet''' is an annual [[Beauty contest|beauty pageant]] held in [[McLeod Ganj]], India.&lt;ref name="mit-site"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.misstibet.com | title=MissTibet.com | publisher=Lobsang Wangyal Productions | accessdate=22 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced by [[Lobsang Wangyal|Lobsang Wangyal Productions]].

==History==
The first-ever Miss Tibet Pageant was produced by [[Lobsang Wangyal]] in October 2002. The pageant was criticized as "aping western culture" and "un-Tibetan". The pageant has continued yearly since then.

In 2017 director Lobsang Wangyal announced that he would not continue organising the Pageant, and it could be sold to someone who would carry on its ideals.&lt;ref name="lw-divest-2017-ht"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tenzin-paldon-wins-miss-tibet-2017-title/story-1o6m8uaX4Dr9IHaEAWqJkI.html | title=Karnataka’s Tenzin Paldon wins Miss Tibet 2017 title | date=5 June 2017 | author=Naresh K Thakur | publisher=Hindustan Times | accessdate=22 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, four Tibetan girls participated in the competition. Four editions of the Pageant's 15 year history—2003, 2005, 2013, and 2014—had only one participant. In 2006, the swimsuit competition was opened to the public.

The Miss Tibet Pageant 2012 was cancelled in response to increased tensions in Tibet and in support of the protests there.&lt;ref name="twa-201204"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tibetanwomen.org/2012/05/miss-tibet-pageant-suspended/ | title=Miss Tibet Pageant suspended | date=5 May 2012 | publisher=Tibetan Women's Association | accessdate=13 May 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415233041/http://tibetanwomen.org/2012/05/miss-tibet-pageant-suspended/ | archivedate=15 April 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ians-201204"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/246446/miss-tibet-pageant-cancelled.html | title=Miss Tibet Pageant Cancelled | date=2 May 2012 | publisher=Deccan Herald | accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miss Tibet 2002, [[Dolma Tsering]], has competed in two international pageants. She also won the [[Miss Goodwill]] subsidiary title from the pageant in [[Malaysia]] and the [[Best National Costume]] from another pageant in [[Mexico]].

The [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] considers the pageant unimportant, but it is still held due to popular demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.misstibet.com/audio/ His Holiness Dalai Lama — Comments on Miss Tibet 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of late, the Chinese government has interfered, pressuring international directors to name Miss Tibet as "Miss Tibet-China". Two Miss Tibets had to withdraw from international pageants — Zimbabwe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimbabwesituation.com/feb20_2005.html#link7 Tibetan beauty banned from pageant in Zim]&lt;/ref&gt; and Malaysia&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gfRGMeisoYP7LoRv3Nh2B3t_7GDA Miss Tibet slams China over expulsion from pageant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116074034/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gfRGMeisoYP7LoRv3Nh2B3t_7GDA |date=16 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; — after they were asked to wear sashes with this title. Miss Tibet 2007 Tenzin Dolma was asked to wear such a sash in the Philippines at the last minute, but she refused, and was allowed to go ahead with the Miss Tibet sash. Miss Tibet 2006 Tsering Chungtak withdrew from the Miss Tourism Pageant in Malaysia after Chinese government representatives pressured the organiser to enter her as "Miss Tibet-China" in November 2007. Miss Tibet 2004 Tashi Yangchen had to withdraw from a pageant in Zimbabwe after the Chinese embassy in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, in a similar case of Chinese interference, asked her to wear a "Miss Tibet-China" sash in February 2005.

In October 2011, Tenzin Yangkyi, Miss Tibet 2011, was sent to the [[Miss Asia Pacific World 2011]] beauty pageant, held in [[Daegu]], [[Seoul]], and [[Busan]] in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.misstibet.com/archive/activities/2011/10/24/peoples-choice-award-goes-to-tenzin-yangkyi-in-korea Tenzin Yangkyi in Korea ]&lt;/ref&gt; During the pageant, Yangkyi received pressure from the Chinese government to wear a sash saying "Tibet-China", but she refused.

==Miss Tibet 2012==
The Miss Tibet Pageant 2012 was cancelled in response to increased tensions in Tibet and in support of the protests there.&lt;ref name="twa-201204" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ians-201204" /&gt; The Pageant was to be held in Dharamshala, India, from 8 to 10 June 2012.&lt;ref name="misstibet-2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.misstibet.com/history/year-2012 | title=Miss Tibet 2012 | date=2 May 2012 | author=Lobsang Wangyal | publisher=MissTibet.com | accessdate=13 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miss Tibet 2011==
Miss Tibet Pageant 2011 was the 10th edition of the annual event. The pageant was held in Dharamshala from 3 to 5 June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.misstibet.com/history/year-2011  MissTibet.com history page]&lt;/ref&gt; Tenzin Yangkyi was selected by the judges as Miss Tibet 2011. She represented Tibet in the [[Miss Asia Pacific World 2011]] beauty pageant.

===Controversy/Accusations of fraud===
On 5 June 2012 Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Foreign Correspondent program aired a report which had followed contestants preparing for and undertaking the Miss Tibet 2011 contest. The report outlined the contestant's understanding of how they would be judged - a judging panel of non-Tibetans would be marking the contestants presentations. At the end of the program controversy erupted when the winner was announced.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Mark (Producer). Foreign Correspondent [http://abc.net.au/foreign/content/2012/s3518891.htm "Miss Tibet"], [television broadcast]. Australia, ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation).&lt;/ref&gt;

One contestant remarked that she thought Tenzin Khecheo would have won. Another stated "I think Lobsang Wangyul cheated - he's a fraud." The pageant organiser, Lobsang Wangyal, was confronted by the contestants who wanted to know how the judging had been processed. At first Lobsang Wangyal claimed the marking sheets had been stolen. "I don't have the judges' sheet.  It was stolen ... on the night. ... It's not in the file. The file is empty. ... When I went onstage somebody stole it. I too was surprised." The contestants then pressed Lobsang Wangyal further, at which point he admitted the non-Tibetan judge's markings only affected 25% of the overall evaluation - that he himself controlled the remaining 75% of the marking, and as such, had effectively decided by himself which contestant had won. The confrontation then ended with the contestants walking out and stating to Lobsang Wangyal "You are a fraud." To which Lobsang Wangyal responded "Yeah ... yeah I am."

Lobsang Wangyal then made a follow up statement to the camera saying "Miss Tibet should be someone who should be calm and, you know ... listen and ... be respectful and see ... if this is how Miss Tibetan will be ... oh my god ... no way."

The report then finished with a comment from Ngodop Dolma: "When I look back into Miss Tibet what I've come to realise is that Lobsang's Miss Tibet does not empower Tibetan women but it does the opposite. It actually disempowers Tibetan women. So, I believe the only way it could have any values is if it were run by a woman."

====Director Lobsang Wangyal's response====

Lobsang Wangyal responded a few months after the report was made through a posting on  [http://www.misstibet.com/archive/event/2012/12/24/directors-reply-to-mark-goulds-video-miss-tibet misstibet.com] in which he says that Mr Gould's recruited contestant Ngodup Dolma made the accusation only after she was unsuccessful in the contest. In his statement Lobsang accepted that the folder containing the mark sheets of the finale night had been stolen after the coronation, and suggested that Mr Gould or an accomplice was involved.

==Miss Tibet 2010==
Tenzin Norzom from Varanasi, holder of a Shastri degree (equivalent to Bachelor of Arts in Buddhist Philosophy), was crowned Miss Tibet 2010 at the Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts in McLeod Ganj, India, on 6 June 2010. She received one lakh (100,000.00) Indian rupees (equivalent to 2,200 USD). After the crowning, Norzom said she would use the title to promote the Tibetan cause.

Yangchen Metok, a 19-year-old girl who had escaped to India in 2008, was judged the first runner-up. She received Rs 50,000.00. Rinchen Choden, a 25-year-old hair stylist from Bangalore, was chosen as the second runner-up. She was given a cheque of Rs 25,000.00. The fourth place Tenzin Namchoe from Golok, Tibet, was given a token prize of Rs 10,000.

Considering the Kyigudo earthquake in eastern Tibet in April, the pageant was kept low-profile. No firecrackers were set off, but instead a short prayer session was held at the opening of the show. [[Lobsang Wangyal]], the director and the producer of the event, gave Rs.10,000 in donation to the victims of the earthquake.

Kingfisher, a leading Indian brand, sponsored the pageant.

[[File:Zhu-Zhanji-Gibbons-at-Play.jpg|thumb|''Gibbons at play'', 1427 painting by the [[Xuande Emperor]]]]
'''[[Monkey]]s''', particularly [[macaque]]s and monkey-like [[gibbon]]s, have played significant roles in '''[[Chinese culture]]''' for over two thousand years. Some examples familiar to English speakers include the [[Chinese zodiac|zodiacal]] Year of the [[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]], the Monkey King [[Sun Wukong]] in the novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', and [[Monkey Kung Fu]].

==Terminology==
The [[Chinese language]] has numerous words meaning "simian; monkey; ape". Some diachronically changed meanings in reference to different simians. For instance, Chinese ''xingxing'' 猩猩 originally named "a mythical creature with a human face and pig body", and became the modern name for the "[[orangutan]]".

Within the classification of [[Chinese characters]], almost all "monkey; ape" words – with the exceptions of ''nao'' 夒 and ''yu'' 禺 that were originally monkey [[Pictogram|pictographs]] – are written with [[Chinese character classification#Phono-semantic compound characters|radical-phonetic compound characters]]. These characters combine a [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]] or classifier that roughly indicates [[semantic field]], usually the "[[Radical 94|dog/quadruped radical]]" 犭 for simians, and a phonetic element that suggests pronunciation. For instance, this animal classifier is a graphic component in ''hou'' 猴 (with a ''hou'' 侯 "marquis" phonetic) "macaque; monkey" and ''yuan'' 猿 (with ''yuan'' 袁 "long robe") "gibbon; monkey".

Note that the following discussion of "monkey; ape" terminology will cite three fundamental sources. The oldest extant Chinese dictionary, the (c. 3rd century BCE) ''[[Erya]]'' ([[s:zh:爾雅#釋獸 第十八|Chapter 18, 釋獸 "Explaining Wild Animals"]]) glosses seven names for monkeys and monkey-like creatures in the 寓屬 "Monkey/Wild Animal" taxonomy. The first Chinese character dictionary, the (121 CE) ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' defines many names of simians, primarily under the ([[s:zh:說文解字#犬部/11|犬部 "dog/quadruped" radical]]) in Chapter 11. The classic Chinese pharmacopoeia, [[Li Shizhen]]'s (1597) ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' ([[s:zh:本草綱目/獸之四|獸之四 "Animals No. 4" chapter]]) lists medical uses for five ''Yu'' 寓 "monkeys" and three ''Kuai'' 怪 "supernatural beings". The latter are ''[[wangliang]]'' 魍魎 "a demon that eats the livers of corpses", ''[[penghou]]'' 彭侯 "a tree spirit that resembles a black tailless dog", and ''[[Feng (mythology)|feng]]'' 封 "an edible monster that resembles a two-eyed lump of flesh".

Li Shizhen distinguishes 11 varieties of monkeys: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;A small one with a short tail is called Hou ([猴] monkey). If it looks like a monkey but has a prominent moustache, then it is called Ju [狙]. If it looks like a monkey but is bigger, then it is Jue [貜]. A monkey that is big, with red eyes and a long tail, is called Yu [禺]. A monkey that is small but has a long tail and an upright nose is called You [狖]. A monkey that is similar to You but is bigger is called Guoran [果然]. A monkey that is similar to You but smaller is called Mengsong [蒙頌]. A monkey that is similar to You but jumps a lot is called Canhu [獑猢]. A monkey that has long arms is called Yuan ([猿] ape). A monkey that is similar to Yuan but has a golden tail is called Rong [狨]. A monkey that is similar to Yuan but bigger, and can eat apes and monkeys, is called Du [獨]. (s.v. ''Jue'', tr. Luo 2003: 4124, cf. Read 1931: no. 400B) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nao===
[[File:夒-oracle.svg|thumb|90 px|Oracle script for ''nao'' 夒 "a monkey"]]
[[File:夒-bronze-spring.svg|thumb|90 px|bronze script for ''nao'' 夒 "a monkey"]]
[[File:夒-seal.svg|thumb|90 px|Seal script for ''nao'' 夒 "a monkey"]]
[[File:夔-seal.svg|thumb|90 px|[[Seal script]] for ''kui'' 夔 "a demon"]]
'''Nao''' 夒 was the first "monkey" term recorded in the historical corpus of [[written Chinese]], and frequently appeared in (14th-11th centuries BCE) [[Shang dynasty]] [[oracle bone inscriptions]]. This oracle pictograph of "a monkey" showed its head, arms, legs, and short tail; which were convergented as 目/頁 (“head”/“eye”), 又/爪 (“hand”/“claw”) and later 止 (“foot”, which was a corruption from 爪 in this character), 已/巳 ("finished"/"foetus", which was corrupt from the tail) not later than the end of  (6th century BCE) [[Spring of Autumn Period]] [[bronze script]]. Compare the seal character for ''[[Kui (Chinese mythology)|kui]]'' 夔 "a legendary demon with a human face and body of a monkey/dragon", which resembles the seal character for ''nao'' with the addition of what appears to be long hair on its head.

This graphically complex character ''nao'' 夒 "monkey" had an early variant ''nao'' 獿 (with the "quadruped" radical and ''nao'' phonetic), and a simpler replacement ''nao'' 猱 "monkey" (same radical and a ''rou'' 柔 phonetic), which is common in modern usage.

The etymology of ''nao'' &lt; *''nû'' 夒 or 猱 "monkey" (Schuessler 2007:397) "is elusive", and may be connected with [[Proto-Mon–Khmer language|Proto-Mon–Khmer]] *''knuuy'' "macaque; monkey" or [[Proto-Tibeto-Burman language|Proto-Tibeto-Burman]] *''mruk''; compare *''ŋoh'' 禺 next.

The first Chinese character dictionary, the (121 CE) ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' defines ''nao'' 夒 as "a greedy animal, generally said to be a ''muhou'' "monkey" resembling a person" (貪獸也一曰母猴似人);, see ''muhou'' below.

The poet [[Li Bai]] alludes to ''nao'' (猱) populating the [[Taihang Mountains]], in the north of China, near the capital city [[Chang'an]], in the poem "白馬篇": it should be duly noted that this literary source contextually suggests a temporal location of the [[West Han]] era (Sun 1982:82-85).

===Yu===
'''Yu''' 禺 "monkey" appeared on (11th-3rd centuries BCE) [[Zhou dynasty]] [[Chinese ritual bronzes]] as a pictograph showing a head, arms, and a tail. ''Yu'' "forenoon, 9 to 11 AM" is the second of five daily divisions (更) in the traditional [[Chinese calendar]]. ''Banyu'' 番禺 was "a district in [[Guangzhou]]". In modern Chinese scientific usage, ''yu'' 禺 refers to the Central and South American "[[spider monkey]]".

The etymology of ''yu'' &lt; *''ŋoh'' 禺 "monkey" (Schuessler 2007:589-590) links with [[Kuki-Naga languages|Kukish]] *''ŋa:w'' "ape" &gt; [[Lushai]] ''ŋau'' "grey monkey"; compare *''nû'' 夒 above.

The ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' defines ''yu'' 禺 as "a kind of ''muhou'' "monkey" with a head resembling a ''gui'' "ghost"" (母猴屬頭似鬼). Compare the above definition of ''nao'' as a ''muhou'' "monkey" resembling a person.

''Yu'' 禺 has a graphic variant ''yu'' 寓 (with the "roof radical") "reside; imply". The ''Erya'' (18) lists monkey definitions under a ''yushu'' 寓屬 "wild animal category". Guo Pu's commentary explains ''yu'' 寓 inclusively means all ''shou'' 獸 "wild animals", and van Gulik (1967:38) says it means "primates in general".

The ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' (tr. Birrell 1999:3) uses ''yu'' 禺 to describe the ''xingxing'', "There is an animal on the mountain which looks like a long-tailed ape, but it has white ears. It crouches as it moves along and it runs like a human. Its name is the live-lively. If you eat it, you'll be a good runner".

The ''Shanhaijing'' records a mythical ''yugu'' 禺谷 "monkey valley", the place where the sun sets, which suggests that "the monkey is a kind of guardian of the approaches to the nether World" (van Gulik 1967:38). Kuafu 禺谷 "Boast Father raced with the sun and ran with the setting sun", but died of thirst on the way (tr. Birrell 1999:123). ''Yugu'' is also written as ''yu'' 虞 "predict; deceive" or ''ou'' 偶 "human image; mate".

===Hou and Muhou===
'''Hou''' 猴 "monkey; macaque" is a common name for simians. For instance, ''houzi'' 猴子 means "monkey" or "clever/glib person". '''Muhou''' 母猴 "macaque; rhesus monkey" compounds ''mu'' "mother" and ''hou'' "monkey", and can also mean "female monkey" in modern usage. Van Gulik (1967:35) says that ''muhou'' is a phonetic rendering of a non-Chinese term" because ''mu-'' occurs in four variants: 母 and 沐 "wash one's hair" in Zhou texts, and 米 "rice" or 獼 in Han texts. In modern Chinese usage, ''mihou'' 獼猴 means "macaque; rhesus monkey". The etymology of ''hou'' &lt; [[Old Chinese]] *''gô'' 猴 "monkey" (Schuessler 2007:279) probably derives from [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] *''ʔ-ko''. The first syllable in ''muhou'' &lt; *''môʔ-gô'' 母猴 or ''muhou'' &lt; *''môk-gô'' 沐猴 "macaque" may perhaps be a "pre-initial" supported by the [[Lolo-Burmese languages|Lolo-Burmese]] ''mjo k&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;œ'' &lt; *''mjok'' "monkey", which might have been the source of [[Proto-Tocharian]] *''moko''.

Lu Ji, who was from the southern state of [[Wu (state)|Wu]], noted ''muhou'' was a Chu word (tr. Van Gulik 1967:35): "The ''nao'' is the macaque [''mihou''], called by the people of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] [''muhou'']. After a macaque has grown old, he becomes a ''que'' [貜]. Macaques with long arms are called gibbons (''yuan''). Gibbons with a white waist are called [''chan'' 獑]." Van Gulik explains the legendary ''que'' with the grey whiskers of mature macaques, and associates the ''chan'' with the [[rhesus macaque]], or ''huchan'' 胡獑, found in present day Yunnan.

The ''Shuowen jiezi'' defines ''hou'' as ''nao'', and defines ''nao'' 夒, ''yu'' 禺, ''jue'' 玃, and ''wei'' 蜼 as ''muhou''.

The ''Bencao gangmu'' lists ''mihou'' synonyms of: ''muhou'' 沐猴, ''weihou'' 為猴, ''husun'' 胡孫, ''wangsun'' 王孫, ''maliu'' 馬留, and ''ju'' 狙; and Li Shizhen explains the names.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The book ''[[Bai Hu Tong|Baihu Tongyi]]'' by [[Ban Gu]]: Hou means "wait" [''hou'' 候, n.b., ''hou'' 猴 does not occur in the received text]. When it sees a man put some food in a trap, it will stay in a higher position and look at the food for a long time. It is an animal that is good at waiting. The macaque likes to wash its face by rubbing, so it is called Mu [沐 "washing"]. The character was later distorted to Mu ([母] meaning "mother"), which is even further from the original meaning. The book ''Shuowen Jiezi'' (''Book of Philology by Xu Shen''): The character Hou looks like Muhou (monkey), but it is not a female monkey. As macaque looks like a person from the Hu region (the north and west of China where non-Han ethnic groups lived in ancient times), it is called Husun [胡孫]. In the book ''Zhuang Zi'', it is called Ju [狙]. People raise macaques in stables. In this way, horses will not be attacked by disease. So it is colloquially called Maliu ([馬留] meaning "maintaining the horses") in the Hu region (the north and west of China where non-Han ethnic groups lived in ancient times). In Sanskrit books it is called Mosizha [摩斯咤] (transliteration [of ''markaţa'']). (tr. Luo 2003:4124, cf. Van Gulik 1967:35) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bernard E. Read (1931: no. 400) notes, "The menstrual discharge of the monkey [猴經] is said to give immunity to the horse against infectious disease", and suggests the Sanskrit name "is not so remote from the genus name ''Macacus''". ''Husun'' "macaque; monkey" is also written 猢猻, as punned in the surname of [[Sun Wukong]] 孫悟空 "descendent/monkey awakened to emptiness". ''Maliu'' 馬留 (lit. "horse keep") compares with the [[Cantonese]] ''ma&lt;sup&gt;B2&lt;/sup&gt;lɐu&lt;sup&gt;A1&lt;/sup&gt;'' "monkey" word (Schuessler 2007:580).

===Yuan and naoyuan===
'''Yuan''' 猿 "ape; monkey" is used in Chinese terms such as ''yuanren'' 猿人 "ape-man; [[Hominidae]]" and ''Beijing yuanren'' 北京猿人 "[[Peking Man]]".

The etymology of ''yuan'' &lt; *''wan'' 猿 "monkey" (Schuessler 2007:593-59) could be linked with Proto-Tibeto-Burman *''(b)woy'' or [[Proto-Mon–Khmer language|Proto-Mon–Khmer]] *''swaaʔ'' "monkey".

''Yuanhou'' 猿猴 "apes and monkeys", according to Van Gulik (1967:33), originally meant only "gibbons and macaques" but in the last few centuries, it has been widely used in Chinese literature as a comprehensive term for "monkeys". The [[Japanese language]] word ''enkō'' 猿猴 is likewise means "monkey" in general.

'''Naoyuan''' 猱蝯 compounds the ''nao'' 夒 variant 猱 with ''yuan'' 蝯 (combining the [[Radical 142|"insect radical"]] 虫 and ''yuan'' 爰 phonetic). ''Yuan'' has graphic variants of 猨 and 猿. The ''Erya'' defines "The ''naoyuan'' is good at climbing" (猱蝯善援), based upon a pun between ''yuan'' 蝯 "monkey" and ''yuan'' 援 "pull up; climb" (both characters written with the same phonetic element).

''Nao'' 猱 occurs once in the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'', "Do not teach a monkey to climb trees" (毋教猱升木). [[Lu Ji (Shiheng)|Lu Ji]]'s 3rd-century commentary says "The ''nao'' is the macaque [''mihou''], the people of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] call it ''muhou'' (see above). In disagreement, Van Gulik (1967:32) gives reasons why ''nao'' 猱 means "gibbon" not "macaque". First, the ''Erya'' stresses "climbing" as the simian's main characteristic. Second, [[Zhou dynasty]] texts record the ''nao'' as "a typical tree-ape". Third, numerous early literary sources use ''naoyuan'' or ''yuannao'' as a binomial compound.

Van Gulik distinguishes ''nao'' 猱 "gibbon" from the homonym ''nao'' 獶 "monkey" (with a ''you'' 憂 phonetic replacing the uncommon 夒 in ''nao'' 獿)

The term ''nao'' 獿 occurs in the ''[[Record of Music]]'' chapter of the ''[[Book of Rites]]'' criticizing vulgar pantomimes (tr. Van Gulik 1967:32), "Actors take part therein, and dwarfs who resemble ''nao'', men and women mix, and the difference between parents and children is not observed"; "here ''nao'' clearly means a macaque, familiar through the popular monkey-shows."

Van Gulik (1967:33) suggests that Chinese ''yuan'' "gibbon" was a [[loanword]] from the language of Chu, the southernmost state of the Zhou realm. [[Qu Yuan]]'s (c. 3rd-century) ''[[Chuci]]'' uses the term ''yuanyou'' 猿狖 three times (in ''[[Jiu Zhang|Nine Pieces]]''); for instance (tr. Hawkes 1985:160), "Amid the deep woods there, in the twilight gloom, are the haunts where monkeys live." This text also uses ''yuan'' 猿 once (''[[Jiu Ge|Nine Songs]]''), ''yuan'' 蝯 once (in ''[[Nine Laments]]''), and ''houyuan'' 猴猿 once (in ''[[Nine Longings]]''). If ''yuanyou'' was Qu Yuan's (or another ''Chuci'' author's) rendering of a Chu word for "gibbon", then ''naoyuan'' can be understood as a compound of the native Chinese word ''nao'' "monkey in general" and the [[Sinicization|sinified]] loanword ''yuan'' "gibbon"; and gradually, "''nao'' 猱 came to mean "gibbon", whereas ''nao'' 獶 remained reserved for monkeys." ''You'' 狖 was (Van Gulik 1967:31) a Zhou synonym for "gibbon".
&lt;blockquote&gt;During the first centuries of our era, the binoms ''naoyuan'' or ''yuannao'' were superseded as words for "gibbon" by the single term ''yuan'' 猨, written with the classifier "quadruped" instead of that for "insect" 虫; and one prefers the phonetic 袁 to 爰 (rarely 員). This character ''yuan'' 猿 has remained the exclusive term for the Hylobatidae as long as the Chinese in general were familiar with the gibbon. However, when in the course of the centuries more and more mountainous regions were brought under cultivation, and as the deforestation increased accordingly, the habitat of the gibbon shrank to the less accessible mountain forests in the south and south-west, and the Chinese had few opportunities for seeing actual specimens. Until about the 14th century A.D. one may assume with confidence that when a Chinese writer employs the word ''yuan'' 猿, he means indeed a gibbon. Thereafter, however, the majority of Chinese writers knowing about the gibbon only by hearsay, they began to confuse him with the macaque or other Cynopithecoids – a confusion which has lasted till the present day. (1967:33)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Bencao gangmu'' (tr. Van Gulik 1967:33) notes that, "the gibbon's meat may be taken as medicine against hemorrhoids, which may be cured also by always using a gibbon's skin as seat-cover. The fat used as ointment is said to be a wonderful cure for itching sores."

===Rong===
'''Rong''' 狨 was "a long-haired monkey with golden fur that was highly prized". Read (1931:401) suggests it is the "[[lar gibbon]], ''Hylobates entelloides''", and Luo (2003: 4125) identifies it as the [[golden snub-nosed monkey]] ''Rhinopitheeus roxellana''. In addition to meaning "golden snub-nosed monkey", Van Gulik (1967:36)  and notes that in modern Chinese zoological terminology, ''rong'' denotes the [[Callitrichidae]] (or Hapalidae) family including [[marmoset]]s and [[tamarin]]s.

The ''Bencao gangmu'' entry for the ''rong'' 狨 explains the synonym ''nao'' 猱 signifies this monkey's ''rou'' 柔 "soft; supple" hair.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The hair of the golden monkey is long and soft. So it is called Rong (meaning "fine hair"). Nao is a character meaning "soft." Another explanation says that the animal is found in the western Rong region [Sichuan], so it is thus named. There is a kind of long-hair dog that is also called Nao. ... The book ''Tan Yuan'' [談苑] by Yang Yi (楊億): The golden monkey is found in the deep mountains in Sichuan and Shaanxi. It looks like an ape. It has a long tail of golden color. So it is colloquially called Jinsirong [金絲狨] (meaning "golden thread monkey"). It is quick at climbing trees. It loves its tail dearly. When shot by a poisonous arrow, it will bite off its own tail when poisoned. During the Song dynasty (960-1279), only officials of the administration and military of the third rank and above were allowed to use seats and bedding made of golden monkey hide. (tr. Luo 2003: 4126, cf. Read 1931: no. 401)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This entry has two subheadings: the ''yuan'' 猨 or ''changbeihou'' 長臂猴 "gibbon, ''Hylobates agilis''" and the ''du'' 獨 (below).
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ape is good at climbing trees. It is found in the deep mountains in the Chuan and Guang regions. It looks like a monkey, but has very long arms. It is an animal that can practice [Daoist] ''qi'' (Vital Energy), so it lives a long life. Some say it has one arm stretching from one side to the other. This is not correct. Its arm bone can be made into a flute that sounds very clear and resonant. Apes come in different colors: blue-green, white, black, yellow and crimson. It is a kind and quiet animal, and likes to eat fruits. It lives in forests and can jump over a distance of several dozen ''chi''. But when it falls and drops onto the ground, it may suffer from excessive diarrhea and then die. Treatment is the drinking of juice of Fuzi/radix aconiti lateralis/daughter root of common monkshood. Apes live in groups. The male cries a lot. It makes three cries consecutively. The cry sounds miserable and is penetrating. The book ''Guihai Zhi'' [桂海志] by Fan Chengda: There are three varieties of apes: Yellow ones with golden thread; black ones with jade faces; and black ones with black faces. Some say the pure black one is the male, and the golden thread one is the female. A male one shouts and a female does not. The book ''Rixun Ji'' [日詢記] by Wang Ji: People in the Guang region say that when an ape is born, it is black and male, When it gets old, it turns yellow and its genitals become ulcerous, and then it turns into a female. Then it mates with the black one. After another several hundred years, the yellow ape will evolve into a white one. (tr. Luo 2003: 4126, cf. Read 1931 no. 401A)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Jue and Juefu===
'''Juefu''' 貜父 "a large monkey" compounds ''jue'' "an ape" and ''fu'' "father". The character ''jue'' 貜 combines the [[Radical 153|"cat/beast radical"]] 豸 and a ''jue'' 矍 "look startled" phonetic (with two 目 "eyes"); compare the graphic variants of 玃 and 蠼. Based upon this phonetic element, the ''Erya'' (tr. Van Gulik 1967:25) glosses: "''Juefu'', good at looking." (貜父善顧). The ''juefu'' is also called ''jueyuan'' 玃猿, which is known as [[Kakuen]] in Japanese mythology.

The ''fulu'' 附錄 "appendix" to the ''Bencao gangmu'' entry for ''mihou'' "macaque" adds the ''jue'' 玃 "A species of large ape or hoolock, found in Western China, and said to be six feet high, it probably denotes the great gibbon, ''Hylobates''", the "northern gray gibbon, ''Hylobates muelleri funereus''" (viz., [[Müller's Bornean gibbon]]) (Read 1931: no. 400A); and the ''ju'' 豦 (graphically "tiger" and "pig") "wild boar; a yellow and black monkey" or ''jufu'' 舉父 "lift/raise father", the "[[lion-tailed macaque]], ''Macaca/Inuus silenus''" (Read 1931: no. 400B). The ''jue'' entry says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a kind of old monkey. It lives in the mountains in western Sichuan. It looks like a monkey. But it is bigger and is gray and black. It can walk like a human. It robs things from humans, and looks around its surrounding from time to time. There are only male ones and no female ones, so it is also called Juefu (father monkey) or Jiajue. It may kidnap a girl and marry her to have children. The book ''Shenyi Jing'': There is a kind of animal called Zhou in the west that is as big as a donkey but looks like a monkey. It can climb trees. There are only female ones and no males. They block the road in the mountains and kidnap men who happen to pass on the road. The men are then forced to mate with then. This is the way the animal gets offspring. It is also a kind of Jue, but a female one. (tr. Luo 2003: 4124-4125, cf. Van Gulik 1967:26)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This all-female ''zhou'' monkey is written with a non-Unicode character, combining the 豸 radical and ''zhou'' 周 phonetic.

Li Shizhen describes the ''ju(fu)'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is found in the mountains in Jianping. It is the size of a dog but looks like a monkey. It is black and yellow, and covered with a big beard and bristles. It may throw stones to strike humans. The book ''Xishan Jing'': There is a kind of animal in Chongwu Mountain. It looks like Yu but has long arms. It is good at throwing stones. It is called Jufu. (tr. Luo 2003: 4125, cf. Read 1931: no. 400B) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ju===
'''Ju''' 狙 originally meant "macaque; monkey" and came to mean "spy; watch for" (e.g., ''juji'' 狙擊 "attack from ambush). The ''Shuowen jiezi'' defines ''ju'' as "a kind of [''jue''] monkey, also said to mean a dog that briefly bites a person" (玃屬一曰狙犬也暫齧人者).

The (c. 4th-3rd centuries BCE) ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' was the oldest [[Chinese classic]] to use ''ju''. For instance, it has two versions of a quote from [[Laozi]] (called Lao Dan 老聃, lit. "old [[helix (ear)|helix]]less-ears") using the term ''yuanzu'' 猿狙 "gibbon and macaque; monkey" to exemplify someone who is not a Daoist sage. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Compared to the sages," said Old Longears "he would be like a clerk at his labors or a craftsman tied to his work, toiling his body and vexing his mind. Furthermore, it is the patterned pelt of the tiger and the leopard that bring forth the hunter, it is the nimbleness of the gibbon and the monkey that bring forth the trainer with his leash. Can such as these be compared with enlightened kings?" (7, tr. Mair 1994:68, cf. 12 1994:109) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Shanhaijing'' mentions two mythological animals named with ''ju''. First, the ''xieju'' 猲狙 (with ''xie'' or ''he'' "short-muzzled dog"):  
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is an animal on this mountain which looks like a wolf, but it has a scarlet head and rat eyes. It makes a noise like a piglet. Its name is the snubnose-dogwolf. It eats humans. (4, tr. Birrell 1999:62-63) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Second, the ''zhuru'' 狙如 (with ''ru'' "be like"):
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is an animal on this mountain which looks like a white-eared rat; it has white ears and white jaws. Its name is the monkey-like. Whenever it appears, that kingdom will have a great war. (5, tr. Birrell 1999:96) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Xingxing===
[[File:Wakan Sansai Zue - Shojo.jpg|thumb|A ''shōjō'' illustration from the 1712 ''[[Wakan Sansai Zue]]'']]
'''Xingxing''' 猩猩 or '''shengsheng''' 狌狌"a monkey; orangutan" reduplicates ''xing'', which graphically combines the "quadruped radical" with a ''xing'' 星 "star" phonetic, or with ''sheng'' 生 "life" in the variant ''xing'' or ''sheng'' 狌. The name is used for foreign simians in modern terminology, ''xingxing'' means "[[orangutan]]", ''heixingxing'' with ''hei-'' 黑 "black" means "chimpanzee", and ''daxingxing'' with ''da-'' 黑 "large" "gorilla".

The ''Erya'' says, "The [''xingxing''] is small, and likes to cry." (猩猩小而好啼). Guo Pu's commentary (tr. Van Gulik 1967:26) notes, "The ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' says: It has a human face and the body of a pig, and it is able to speak. At present it is found in [Jiaoji] and the [Fengxi] district (i.e. North Indo-China). The [''xingxing''] resembles a [''huan'' 獾] (badger) or small pig. Its call resembles the crying of a small child." Fengxi 封谿 corresponds to modern [[Bắc Ninh Province]] in Vietnam.

The ''Huainanzi'' (tr. Major et al. 2010:508) says, "The orangutan knows the past but does not know the future; the male goose knows the future but does not know the past."; [[Gao You]]'s commentary (tr. Van Gulik 1967:26) says, "The [''xingxing''] has a human face but the body of a beast, and its colour is yellow. It is fond of wine."

The ''Bencao gangmu'' entry for the ''xingxing'' or ''shengsheng'', which Read (1931: no. 403) identifies as the "orangutan, Simia satyrus", records,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Li Shizhen: An orangutan can talk and knows about the future. Xingxing [猩猩] means [''xingxing'' 惺惺] "intelligent". The orangutan was recorded in books like ''Er Ya'' and ''Yi Zhou Shu'' several dozen times. The following explanation is a summary: It is found in the mountain valleys in the Ailaoyi area and Fengxi County in Jiaozhi. It looks like a dog or a macaque. Its yellow hair resembles that of an ape, and its white ears resemble those of a pig. Its face looks human, and its legs are similar to those of a man. It has long hair and a good-looking face and head. It cries in the same way as a baby cries, or as a dog barks. They flock together and move covertly. Ruan Qian: Local people in Fengxi catch the animal in the following way: They place some wine and straw sandals on the roadside. Orangutans will come to the spot and call out the names of the ancestors of the people who placed the things. Then they leave temporarily and come back shortly afterwards. They drink the wine and try the sandals on. While the orangutans are enjoying themselves, people catch them and then keep them in cages. When one of them is to be killed, the fattest one will be chosen. It weeps sadly. People in the Xihu area use its blood to dye a kind of woolen fabric, which will maintain its bright color for a long time. After a puncture is made in the orangutan to let out blood, the person will flog the animal and ask it for the number of beatings. The flogging will stop after one ''dou'' of blood has been collected. The book ''Li Ji'' (''Record of Rites'') said that the orangutan could speak. The book ''Guang Zhi'' by Guo Yigong said that the orangutan could not speak. The book ''Shanhai Jing'' also said that the orangutan could speak. [Li Shizhen comments]: The orangutan is a kind of animal that looks like a human being. It looks like an ape or a monkey and can speak simple words like a parrot. It may not be the same as what Ruan Qian said. The book ''Er Ya Yi'' by Luo Yuan: In ancient books, the orangutan was described as similar to a pig, dog or monkey. But now it is recorded that the animal looks like a baboon. It looks like a naked bare-foot woman with long hair hanging from the head. They do not seem to have knees, and they travel in a group. When they encounter human beings, they cover their bodies with their hands. People say this is a kind of savage human. According to what Luo Yuan said, it seems such a creature is actually a Yenü (meaning "wild girl") or Yepo (meaning "wild woman"). Are they the same? (tr. Luo 2003: 4128, cf. Read 1931: no. 403) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The subentry for the ''yenü'' 野女 "wild women" or 野婆 "wild wife" says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The book ''[[Bowuzhi|Bowu Zhi]]'' [博物志] by Tang Meng: In the Rinan area there is a kind of creature called the Yenü (meaning "wild girl") that travels in group. No male ones are to be found. They are white and crystal-like, wearing no clothes. The book ''Qidong Yeyu'' by Zhou Mi [周密]: Yepo (meaning "wild woman") is found in Nandanzhou. It has yellow hair shaped into coils. It is naked and wears no shoes. It looks like a very old woman. All of them are female and there are no male ones. They climb up and down the mountain as fast as golden monkeys. Under their waists are pieces of leather covering their bodies. When they encounter a man, they will carry him away and force him to mate. It is reported once that such a creature was killed by a strong man. It protected its waist even when it was being killed. After dissecting the animal, a piece of seal chip was found that was similar to a piece of gray jade with inscriptions on it. Li Shizhen: According to what Ruan Qian and Luo Yuan said above, it seems that this Yenü is actually an orangutan. As to the seal chip found in the animal, it is similar to the case that the testes of a male mouse are said to have seal characters [''fuzhuan'' 符篆 "symbolic [[seal script]]"] on them, and the case that under the wing of a bird a seal of mirror has been found. Such things are still unclear to us.  (tr. Luo 2003:4128, cf. Read 1931: no. 403A) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The bright scarlet dye known as ''xingxingxue'' 猩猩血 "gibbon's blood" was not used by the Chinese, but observed in imported Western textiles. Although the source for this tradition of the bloody dye remains untraced, [[Edward H. Schafer]] (1963:210) notes a Western analogue in "St. John's blood", a variety of the red dye [[Kermes (dye)|kermes]], which derives from the insect [[Kermes (genus)|kermes]]. The Tang dynasty chancellor [[Pei Yan]] wrote, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''hu'' ["barbarians"] of the Western countries take its blood for dyeing their woolen rugs; its color is clean and will not turn black. Some say that when you prick it for its blood, if you ask, "How much will you give me?" the [''xingxing''] will say, "Would two pints be truly enough?" In order to add to this amount, you thrash it with a whip before asking and it will go along with an increase, so that you can obtain up to a gallon. (''Quan Tangwen'' 全唐文, tr. Schafer 1963:209)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Edward H. Schafer]] quotes a Tang story.
&lt;blockquote&gt;A number of the beasts were captured and put in a pen, to be cooked for the magistrate of a [[Tonkin]]ese town. They picked the fattest of their number and thrust it weeping forth, to await the magistrate's pleasure in a covered cage: "The Commandant asked what thing this was, and the [''xingxing''] spoke from within the cage, and said, 'Only your servant and a jug of wine!' The Commandant laughed, and cherished it." Of course the clever, winebibbing animal became a treasured pet. (1963:209) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Chinese belief that gibbons enjoyed drinking wine has parallels in [[Classical antiquity]], "monkeys were reputed to be overfond of wine, as Aristotle, Aelian, and Pliny observed, and their drunkenness made them easy to capture."
Chinese stories about the ''xingxing'' liking wine appealed to the Japanese. In [[Japanese mythology]], the [[Shōjō]] 猩猩 was a god of wine with a red face and long, red hair, who was always drunk and dancing merrily. Compare the [[drunken monkey hypothesis]] that the human attraction to ethanol may have a genetic basis.

===Feifei===
'''Feifei''' 狒狒 "monkey; baboon" reduplicates ''fei'', written with the "dog/quadruped radical" 犭with a ''fu'' 弗 phonetic. Van Gulik (1967:29) says Chinese zoologists have adopted ''feifei'' as a convenient modern rendering of "baboon".

The ''Erya'' glosses, "The ''feifei'' resembles a person; it has long hair hanging down on its back; it runs quickly and devours people." (狒狒如人被髮迅走食人). Guo Pu's commentary says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the [''xiaoyang'' 梟羊] "owl-goat". The [''Shanhaijing''] says: As to its shape it has a human face, with long lips; its body is black, with hair hanging down to its heels. When meeting with people it laughs. This animal occurs in N[orth] Indo-China, [Guangxi], and [Guangdong]. The large ones are over ten feet tall. Locally the animal is called [''shandu'' 山都]. (tr. Van Gulik 1967:28) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Xiaoyang''' 梟羊 is a variant of the mythic ''[[Xiao (mythology)#Chinese Xiaoyang|xiaoyang]]'' 梟楊 "owl-poplar", which [[David Hawkes (Sinologist)|David Hawkes]] (1985:268) describes as "an anthropoid monster whose upper lip covers his face when he laughs. His laughter was sinister, it was said, being an indication that he was about to eat human flesh."

The ''Shuowen Jiezi'' (Liu 2003: 4129) writes ''feifei'' 𥝋𥝋 with an obsolete pictograph, and Xu Shen says: "People in the north call it Tulou [土螻 "earth cricket"]. Now people call it Renxiong [人熊 "man bear"]."

The (c. 9th century) ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'' describes the ''feifei''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;If one drinks its blood one can see ghosts. Its strength equals ten-thousand catties. When it laughs, it curls up its upper lip which then covers its forehead. It has the shape of a macaque and it is capable of human speech, which sounds like the twitter of birds. It can foretell births and deaths. Its blood can be used as a purple dye and its hair for making wigs. An old tradition says that its feet are reversed. Hunters say it has no knees, so that when sleeping it has always to lean against some support. In the early [[Liu Song dynasty]] period (420 to 479 A.D.), [[Guangxi]] sent a pair of [''feifei''] as tribute. (tr. Van Gulik 1967:28) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Regarding this widely copied ''fanzhong'' 反踵 "reversed feet" description, Van Gulik reasons that a copyist misread the ''ji'' 及 "extend; down to" in Guo Pu's 及踵 "hair hanging down to its heels" comment as ''fan'' 反 "reverse; opposite". He further (1967:29) suggests that the human face, long lips, and long red hair description of the ''feifei'' could apply to the orangutan.

The ''Bencao gangmu'' entry for ''feifei'', identified as the "golden snub-nosed monkey, Rhinopithecus roxellanae" and "baboon" ''Papio hamadryas'' (Liu 2003: 4129),  lists other synonyms of ''xiaoyang'' 梟羊 "owl goat", ''yeren'' 野人 "wild man; savage" (see [[Yeren]]), and ''shandu'' 山都 "mountain capital".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Chen Cangqi: The baboon is found in the Yi areas in the southwest. The book ''Er Ya'': The baboon is in the shape of a human being with disheveled hair. It runs very fast and may eat humans. The book ''Shanhai Jing'': Xiaoyang has a human-like face, long lips and a black body. It is covered with hair. It has reversed heels. It laughs when it sees a human being, and when it laughs its upper lip may cover its eyes. Guo Pu: In the Jiao and Guang regions and also in the mountains in Nankangjun, such creatures can be found. A big one may be as tall as 10 ''chi''. It is colloquially called Shandu. In one of the years of the Xiaojian reign of the Song dynasty (960-1279), people from the indigenous areas contributed a pair of baboons to the emperor, one male and one female. The emperor asked Ding Luan, a representative from the tribe, about the animal. Ding Luan answered: "The face of the animal looks like a human being. It is covered with red hair like a macaque. It has a tail. It can talk like a human being, but it sounds like the chirping of a bird. It can predict life and death. It is very strong and can carry very heavy things. It has reversed heels and seems to have no knees. When it sleeps, it leans against something. When it catches a human being, it first laughs and then eats him. A hunter can catch the animal by using this trick. He puts one arm through a bamboo tube to lure the animal. When the animal laughs heartily, the person uses a nail to try to pin its lip to its forehead. Then the animal will run around wildly and die shortly afterwards. It has very long hair, which can be used to make wigs. Its blood can be added in the dyeing of boots or silk fabrics. If one drinks its blood, one will be able to see ghosts." After this explanation, the emperor ordered a painter to do a portrait of the animal. Li Shizhen: The book ''Fangyu Zhi'': The baboon can also be found in the mountains in western Sichuan and Chuzhou. It is also called Renxiong. People catch it, and eat its paws and peel off its hide. In the You Mountains of Shaxian County in Fujian, the animal is also found. It is more than 10 ''chi'' tall and laughs when it encounters a human being. It is also called Shandaren, Yeren, or Shanxiao. The book ''Nankang Ji'' by Deng Deming: Shandu looks like a wild man from Kunlun Mountain. Its body is covered with hair. When it encounters a human being, it closes its eyes and opens its mouth, seeming to laugh. It turns stones in mountain streams to find crabs for food. (tr. Luo 2003: 4129, cf. Read 1931: no. 404) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Bencao gangmu'' supplement lists four other monkey-like creatures under ''feifei''.

'''Shandu''' 山都, which Read identifies as the "[[chacma baboon]], Cynocephalus porcarius":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Li Shizhen: The book ''Shuyi Ji'' [述異記] by Ren Fang: There is a kind of spirit in Nankang that is called Shandu. It looks like a human being and is just over two ''chi'' tall. It is black with red eyes and yellow hair. It makes its nest in a tree in the deep mountains. Its nest looks like bird nest over three ''chi'' tall. These nests are bright and lustrous inside, and are light and quite empty. Usually two such nests are placed together on a mattress made of bird feathers. The upper one is for the male and the lower one is for the female. Shandu may appear in different forms and can even become invisible. It is very difficult to find such a creature. It is similar to Muke and Shanxiao. (tr. Luo 2003: 4130, Read 1931: no 404A)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Shanhui''' 山𤟤: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Li Shizhen: The book ''Beishan Jing'': Shanhui looks like a dog but has a human-like face. It is good at throwing stones. When it encounters a human being, it laughs. It runs as fast as the wind. When such a creature is sighted, there will be strong winds all over the country. (tr. Luo 2003: 4130, cf. Read 1931: no. 404B)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Shanhaijing'' context describes the ''[[Xiao (mythology)#Chinese Shanxiao|shanxiao]]'' 山魈 or ''shanhui'' 山𤟤.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is an animal on this mountain which looks like a dog but it has a human face. It is good at throwing. When it sees a human being, it laughs. Its name is the mountain-monkey. It moves like the wind. Whenever it appears, there will be typhoons over all under the sky. (Yufa Mountain 獄法之山, tr. Birrell 1999:41) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Muke''' 木客 "tree guest": 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The book ''Nankang Ji'': It is found in the mountains in the south. Its head and face are similar to those of a human being, and it talks like a human. But its paws have sharp claws. They live among steep cliffs and bury the dead like human beings. It can change things with human beings, but it does not show itself in front of human beings. Now there is a kind of ghost market in the south where such trades take place. There is also a creature called Mukeniao (a bird), which is recorded in the "Category of Fowls." (tr. Luo 2003: 4130, cf. Read 1931: no. 404C) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Shanxiao''' 山 [non-Unicode character with 犭radical and ''zao'' 喿 phonetic]: "The one footed mythological monster. Numerous beings are described in the [''Shanhaijing'']. It says that people cannot see it therefore it seems utter nonsense to write so much about it." {{sic}} (tr. Read 1931: no. 404D) See the ''[[Xiao (mythology)#Chinese Shanxiao|shanxiao]]'' 山魈.

===Wei===
'''Wei''' 蜼 "a monkey" is written with a character that combines the [[Radical 142|"insect radical"]] 虫 with a ''zhui'' 隹 phonetic. The etymology of ''wei'' &lt; *''wih'' or *''ruiʔ'' (&lt; *''r-wiʔ'') 蜼 "kind of monkey-like animal" (Schuessler 2007:513) is hypothetically connected with [[Palaungic languages|Palaung-Wa]] *''rəyol'' "white-handed gibbon" or the ''-i'' in ''wei'' could be a diminutive suffix added to the ''you'' &lt; *''wu'' 猶 "monkey" word.

The ''Erya'' glosses, "The ''wei'' has an upturned nose and a long tail. It is good at climbing mountain peaks." (蜼卬鼻而長尾時善乘領). Guo Pu (tr. Van Gulik 1967:29) says, "The ''wei'' resembles the macaque but is larger. Its colour is yellowish-black, its tail several feet long, resembling an otter's tail, forked at the tip. Its nostrils are tilted upward; when it rains the ''wei'' hangs from a tree and covers its nostrils with its tail, or with two fingers. The people east of the (Yangtse) River catch and raise it. It is swift and strong." Based on this description, Van Gulik identifies ''wei'' as the [[golden snub-nosed monkey]] (''Rhinopithecus roxellana''), which is "a smaller monkey with a long tail, and a pronounced upturned nose; it has a blue-black face, and long, fluffy golden fur."

===You===
'''You''' 猶 "a monkey" has an uncertain etymology and meaning. Schuessler (2007:580) notes ''you'' &lt; *''ju'' &lt; Proto-Chinese *''wu'' 猶 "a kind of monkey" has [[comparative linguistics]] similarities with Proto-Tibeto-Burman *''myuk'' or *''mruk'' &gt; [[Burmese language|Burmese]] ''myok'' and [[Mru language|Mru]] ''yuk'' "monkey". ''You'' &lt; *''ju'' phonologically resembles two Old Chinese "monkey" words: ''yu'' &lt; *''ŋoh'' 禺 and ''hou'' &lt; *''gô'' 猴. The character猶, with the "quadruped radical" and a ''qiu'' 酋 phonetic, originally denoted a simian, but became a common Chinese [[phonetic loan character]] for ''you'' "still; yet".

The ''Erya'' glosses ''you'' as "Like a [[muntjac]] and good at climbing trees" (如麂善登木). Hao Yixing 郝懿行's 19th-century sub-commentary says, "The wild animal ''you'' is a kind of monkey, shaped like a muntjac, which resembles a hornless deer with feet like a dog." The ''you'' is also called ''youhu'' 猶猢 and identified as the ''husun'' 猢猻.

The ''Shuowen jiezi'' defines ''you'' as "a kind of ''jue'' "large monkey", ''you'' is also said to be the Longxi [modern [[Tianshui]] region] word for "puppy" (玃屬一曰隴西謂犬子為猷).

===Du===
'''Du''' 獨 (lit. "alone") named "a larger monkey", which was interpreted as a monkey with "solitary habits", based on the word's literal meaning (Van Gulik 1967:36). Read (1931: no. 401B) identifies it as "a species of baboon or mandrill".

The ''Bencao gangmu'' ''rong'' 狨 entry notes the ''du'' 獨. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Du looks like an ape but is bigger. It stays alone and gives a single cry at a time. It eats apes and monkeys. So there is an idiom saying that when a Du cries, all apes will disperse. The term "dufu" (獨夫, a lone man, or a "dictator.") has its origin in this animal. Some say this animal is actually the Huangyao [黄腰 "yellow waist"]. Also see explanations in the class of Hu (tiger). (tr. Luo 2003: 4126, cf. Read 1931: no. 401B)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Bencao gangmu'' entry for ''hu'' 虎 "tiger" lists ''huangyao'' among animals that are strong enough to kill and eat tigers.

===Guoran===
'''Guoran''' 果然 (lit. "indeed; really") or 猓然 is described as "a timid monkey with a long tail". Van Gulik (1967:36) tentatively associates ''guoran'' with the [[surili]] monkeys of the genus [[Presbytis]] found in Southeast Asia.

The ''Bencao gangmu'' entry for the ''Guoran'' 果然, which Read identifies as the "[[proboscis monkey]], ''Nasalis larvatus''", lists synonyms of ''Yu'' 禺, ''You'' 狖, ''Lei'' or ''Wei'' 蜼, and ''Xianhou'' 仙猴 "[[Xian (Taoism)|transcendent]] monkey".
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Guo Pu]]: Guoran is an animal that cries in a way as if it is calling its own name. Luo Yuan (羅願): If one of them is caught, a whole group of them will cry and attack. Even when some are being killed, others will stay by. So it is called Guoran. The term means "assured," meaning when one is endangered, it can be assured that the others will come to its rescue. A big one is called Ran, or Yu. A small one is called You or Lei. People in the south call it Xianhou [仙猴]. Chen Cangqi [陳藏器]: The book ''Nanzhou Yiwu Zhi'': In the area of Jiaozhou there is a kind of animal called Guoran. It is bigger than an ape. Its body is no more than three ''chi'' long, but its tail may rise above its head when erect. Its nostrils open upward. At times of rain, it will hang itself on a tree with its tail stuffed into its nostrils. Its hair is long, soft, fine and slippery. It is white with black stripes, resembling the colored feathers of a gray duck. Its hide and fur can be made into very warm fur coats and quilts. The book ''Er Ya'' recorded an animal with "upward nostrils and long tail," which is really this animal. Li Shizhen: Guoran is an animal that is kind. They are found in the mountains in the south-west. They live in trees. Guoran looks like an ape. It has a white face with black cheeks. It has a big moustache and multicolored hair. Its tail is long and forked at the tip. When it rains, Guoran stuffs the forked tips of its tail into its nostrils. They like to travel together, the aged ones in the front and the young ones at the back. When they find food, each gives the chance to others to eat first. They live together harmoniously and love each other dearly. When one is endangered, all the others will come to its rescue. As Liu Zongyuan [柳子] noted, it is an animal that is benevolent, polite, filial and kindhearted. In ancient times, the animal was painted as an image of politeness, filial piety and wisdom. However, it is an animal that is very suspicious. When they see a man coming they will climb up a tree and change positions many times. Sometimes they will run wildly, breaking their heads or legs. That is why people say that if a person is so suspicious, he can be compared to this animal. (tr. Luo 2003: 4127, cf. Read 1931: no. 402)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This ''guoran'' heading has two subheadings.

'''Mengsong''' 蒙頌 or '''Menggui''' 蒙貴 (see below).

'''Chanhu''' 獑猢, which the ''Shuowen'' writes with the "rat radical" 鼠 as ''zhanhu shu'' 斬𪕮鼠, is described by Li Shizhen
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a kind of Guoran. It is black with a white stripe on the waist like a belt. Its hands are covered with long white hair. They are held in a manner as if clutching a piece of board. The book ''Shudi Zhi'' [蜀地志]: The Canhu looks like a monkey. It moves very fast and stays in the trees all the time, jumping from one tree to another like a bird. (tr. Luo 2003: 4127, cf. Read 1931: no. 402B) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mengsong===
'''Mengsong''' 蒙頌 or '''menggui''' 蒙貴 (lit. "cover praise" or "cover expensive") "a dark monkey, a skillful [[rat-catcher]]" is an obscure ancient name. Read (1931: no. 402A) suggests ''mengsong'' was the "[[mongoose]], ''Herpestidae mungo''".

The ''Erya'' succinctly defines ''mengsong'' as "shaped like a [''nao''] monkey" (蒙頌猱狀). Since the ''Erya'' dictionary, which glosses words from the [[Chinese classics]], has the oldest textual usage of '''mengsong''', the name presumably comes from a lost pre-Qin classic. Guo Pu's commentary gives the synonym ''menggui'' and says (tr. Read 1931: no. 402A), "An animal like a small [''wei''] proboscis monkey, purple black in color, from Yunnan (交趾 "Annam"). They are reared as rat catchers better than cats." Guo says these monkeys came from present-day central [[Vietnam]], specifically Jiuzhen 九真 and [[Rinan]] 日南, modern [[Khánh Hòa Province]] and [[Nghệ An Province]].

The Tang author [[Duan Chengshi]]'s (853) ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'' says, "Cats are also named ''menggui'' or ''wuyuan'' 烏員 [lit. "crow member"]."

The ''Bencao gangmu'' subsumes ''mengsong'' under the ''guoran'' "monkey" entry (tr. Luo 2003: 4127): "Mengsong is also called Menggui. It is small Guoran. Purple and black, it is found in Jiaozhi. It is raised in houses. It catches mice even better than a cat or a leopard."

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Trachypithecus francoisi 3398.jpg|thumb|[[François' langur]]]]
The [[simian]]s (higher [[primate]]s) [[List of mammals of China#Order: Primates|of China]] include two families of [[Old World monkey]]s (''Cercopithecidae'') and [[lesser apes]] or [[gibbon]]s (''Hylobatidae'', lit. "wood walkers"), listed with modern Chinese [[nomenclature]]:

==Zodiac==
{{Main|Monkey (zodiac)}}
The [[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]] is the ninth of the twelve-year animal cycle in the "[[Chinese zodiac]]". The Year of the [[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]] is associated with ninth [[Earthly Branches|Earthly Branch]] symbol ''shen'' 申 denoting the [[southwest (direction)|southwest]] direction and seventh [[lunar month]]. For example, one Year of the [[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]] begins February 8, 2016.

==Mythology==
[[File:A Modern Journey to the West3.jpg|thumb|[[Sun Wukong]] fighting a wind demon.]]
Several mythical or semi-mythical monkeys are mentioned above in the Terminology section. Early texts treat the ''juefu'' 貜父 (cf. Japanese ''[[kakuen]]'') as both a factual "large ape found in western mountains" and a mythological "[[single-sex]] species that abducts and mates with humans"; said to be either all males (viz. ''fu'' 父 "father") who rape women (''[[In Search of the Supernatural|Soushenji]]'') or all females who rape men (''[[Bencao gangmu]]'', cf. ''xingxing''). The early pictographs for ''nao'' 夒 "monkey" and ''[[Kui (Chinese mythology)|kui]]'' 夔 "a legendary demon with a human face and body of a monkey/dragon" were nearly identical. Chinese legends say that foreign textiles used ''xingxing'' 猩猩 blood as a scarlet dye.

Many Chinese mythological creatures are said to resemble monkeys or apes. For instance, the ''[[Xiao (mythology)|xiao]]'' 囂 is described as "a long-armed ape"  and the ''[[Xiao (mythology)#Chinese Shanxiao|shanxiao]]'' 山魈 "mountain imp" supposedly had a human face and a monkey's body. The lake-dwelling ''shuihouzi'' 水猴子 "[[water monkey]]" is said to like drowning people.

Based on the data for the ''juefu'', ''xingxing'', and ''feifei'', Van Gulik concluded that,
&lt;blockquote&gt; [E]ach of these three "monstrosities of the mountains" is a composite figure: a combination of two entirely different creatures, as observed by those ancient Chinese – hunters, travelers and soldiers – who ventured into the virgin mountain forests of the south-west. In the first place, glimpses caught of some larger simioid. In the case of the [''feifei''], the "human" face, long lips, and long red hair could apply to the orangutan. I leave it to zoologists to decide whether it is at all possible that two thousand years ago the habitat of the orangutan could have reached as far north as Indo-China. Second, Chinese impressions gathered during encounters with the aborigines. In this direction point the "nearly human speech", the pelting with stones, and the killing and/or abducting of man and women. Ever since during the Han dynasty the southwest was brought into the orbit of Chinese administration, these mountain tribes have succeeded in retaining their identity – even though Chinese rule was oppressive, and punitive expeditions against them launched as late as the end of the nineteenth century. Relations between the tribes and the Chinese were always uneasy, and Chinese tales about the aborigines often mention their killing and abducting Chinese citizens. The theory that [''juefu''], [''xingxing''], and [''feifei''] are the combined result of such observations is also supported by the fact that in the oldest pictures preserved, the human features prevail over the simian. (1967:28-29)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like the Indian monkey-god [[Hanuman]] in [[Hindu mythology]], Chinese deities sometimes appear in the guise of monkeys. The best-known of these is [[Sun Wukong]], the main protagonist in [[Wu Cheng'en]]'s [[picaresque novel]] ''[[Journey to the West]]'', also known as ''Monkey''. In the southern regions of China, many temples were built to the monkey-god who is worshipped as the ''Qitian dasheng'' 齊天大聖 "great saint equal to heaven", which was a name of Sun Wukong.

[[Wolfram Eberhard]] (2003:192) explains, "It is not only in Indian mythology that the monkey plays a leading part; it is also found in South Chinese and in Tibetan legend. Several varieties of monkey are native to South China; and according to one Tibetan myth, the Tibetan people are descended from a monkey", namely [[Pha Trelgen Changchup Sempa]]. "Tales of women who have been abducted and ravished by monkeys and who have then given birth to children, are common in South China, and several Chinese 'clans' attribute their origins to such a union." Eberhard (1968:53) calls Yang 楊 the "Monkey Clan", citing the totemistic myth recorded in the ''[[Soushenji]]'' and ''[[Fayuan Zhulin]]'' that the Yangs living in southwestern [[Shu (state)]] (modern [[Sichuan]]) were descendants of monkeys. The ''Soushenji'' (12, tr. Eberhard 1968:52) "reported that in the southwest of Shu there were monkey-like animals whose names were [''jiaguo'' 猳國], [''mahua'' 馬化], or [''jueyuan'' 玃猿, see "Jue and Juefu"]. These animals abducted women and sent them back when they became pregnant. If the baby were not accepted, the woman would have to die. Therefore these children were raised and they received the clan name Yang. For this reason this clan occurred quite frequently in Southwest Shu."

According to orally transmitted accounts collected from the [[Miao people|Miao ethnic group]] of China, at first there were no people, but rather the ancestors of modern humans were monkeys. One day the monkeys went to play in a cave, where a divine dragon resided. The dragon blew upon the monkeys its divine breath, which caused them to be transformed into modern human beings. (Yang 2007:105)

==Religious significance==
[[File:Ohara monkey-moon.jpg|thumb|150 px|Gibbon reaching for the moon's reflection, [[Ohara Koson]], 1926.]]
[[Chinese religions]] use monkeys and apes as metaphors for people. In [[Chinese folk religion]], some shape-shifting monkeys were said to be human ancestors. In [[Daoism]], monkeys, particularly gibbons, were believed have longevity like a ''[[xian (Daoism)|xian]]'' "transcendent; immortal". In [[Chinese Buddhism]], on the one hand, monkeys symbolized restless and foolish humans, and on the other hand, Gautama Buddha was supposedly a benevolent monkey king in an earlier incarnation.

===Folk religion===
Chinese traditional folk religion regards monkeys as supernatural beings. Eberhard (1968:50) cites early reports that monkeys "could talk", "knew the past", and "were like men".

[[Jan Jakob Maria de Groot]]'s classic study of Chinese religions (1908:202) distinguishes "monkey demons" and "were-monkeys", both of which could [[shape shift]] between a monkey and a human. While a monkey demon "often acts as a dangerous devil" (frequently transforming in order to have sex with a human), a were-monkey was usually virtuous (e.g., the monkey who takes human shape in order to become a Buddhist monk, ''Xuanshizhi'' 宣室志).

"Monkey demons" could assume both male and female forms. De Groot (1908:603) describes them as either "a lewd fornicator of wives and maids" or "a seductress, in beautiful female forms, of adults and inexperienced youths, whose senses it bewitches at the detriment of their health". For instance, the (4th century) ''[[In Search of the Supernatural]]'' records a monkey-demon story from the era of [[Emperor Xiaowu of Jin]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the [Taiyuan] period (376-396) of the [Jin] dynasty they kept a monkey in the back palace of [Dizhao 昭翟], prince of [Dingling], in front of the chambers of his concubines. These women once upon a time simultaneously got in the family way, and each of them gave birth to three children that danced and hopped while discharging from the bowels. [Zhao] thus being convinced that the monkey was the culprit, killed the beast and the children; which made the women burst out all at once into wailing. He interrogated them, and they avowed they had seen a young man dressed with a yellow silk robe and a white gauze cap, a most lovely personage, jesting and chatting quite like a man (tr. de Groot 1908:603-4)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Legends about monkey-human interbreeding are common, as noted above ''Jue'' ape-men copulate with women and ''Zhou'' monkey-women copulate with men.

The ''Youyang zazu'' (tr. Eberhard 1968:51) tells a legend that the Chinese peoples were descendants of simians: "a monkey married the female servant of a daughter of heaven and thus became ancestor of the [Ji]; another monkey also married the servant of a daughter of heaven and became founder of the [Cheng]" – using ''Ji'' 姬 (lit. "imperial concubine") as "a general term for southern peoples" and ''Cheng'' 傖 (or ''cang'' 傖 "coarse; vulgar") as "an insulting word for North Chinese who had migrated to the south".

The ''Baopuzi'' lists ways to protect oneself from mountain demons associated with different astronomical days (chap. 17, tr. Ware 1967:288), including "On a day ''shen'' [申 "Monkey"], a man calling himself a lord is a monkey [猴]; a [day ''jiuqing'' 九卿], an ape [猿]."

"Were-monkeys" (named in analogy with [[werewolf]]) were frequently older monkeys that transformed into humans. The (c. 1st century) ''Wu Yue Chunqiu'' (De Groot 1908:201) tells a story about [[King Goujian of Yue]] (r. 496-465 BCE) wanting to improve his army's military skill. One of his ministers suggested: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have recently heard about a virgin girl in [Yue] who has come from the southern forest. The people of that country praise her (martial skill). I request you to summon her, and grant her an interview at once." The king of [Yue] sent envoys to summon her to be questioned about the art of fighting with sword and halberd. When the virgin set out for the north for an audience with the king; she met on her way an old man. He said his name was Mr. [Yuan] and addressed her "I have heard that you are skilled in swordsmanship, I wish you would show me!" The girl replied "Your handmaid would not dare to conceal anything from you. You just test me!" Thereupon Mr. [Yuan] swept his walking staff over a cluster of bamboo trees, and (in that one sweep) laid all the twigs and branches bare. Before the falling leaves had reached the ground, however, the girl had caught them all (on her sword), Mr. [Yuan] then flew up into a tree, and changed into a white gibbon. (tr. van Gulik 1967:40) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Mr. Yuan is named Yuan Gong 袁公, a wordplay upon ''yuan'' 猿 "gibbon; monkey". Noting that this "monkey-man" called himself a member of the [[Yuan (surname)|Yuan 袁 ("monkey") clan]], De Groot says, "In subsequent ages it continues a feature of monkey-myth to represent were-monkeys as persons bearing that tribal name, just as man-foxes were … often believed to be members of the Hu tribe."—referring to the pun between ''hu'' 狐 "fox" and the [[Hu (surname)|Hu 胡 ("barbarian") clan]] (see de Groot 1908:195).

[[File:White Ape.jpg|thumb|''Baiyuan'' "White Gibbon" painting by [[Jesuit]] lay brother [[Giuseppe Castiglione (Jesuit)|Giuseppe Castiglione]], 18th century]]
''Baiyuan'' 白猨 "white gibbons" like "Mr. Yuan" were considered to be spiritually powerful. The (c. 239 BCE) ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'' has a "knack story" about the legendary archer Yang Youji 養由基 and a ''shen baiyuan'' "supernatural white gibbon" that instinctively knew the intentions of humans.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yang Youji and Yin Ru were both men of highly refined skills. In the courtyard of the palace of Chu there was a magical white ape, which even the best archers could not hit, and so the king of Chu asked Yang Youji to try. Yang Youji picked up his bow and arrows and went to try. Before shooting, he had already pinned it with his arrows; with a single shot, the ape fell. Thus, Yang Youji had the ability to hit his target before actually hitting his target. (chap. 24, tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000:619) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The (121 BCE) ''Huainanzi'' tells a simpler version of this story.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The king of Chu had a white ape. When the king himself shot at it, the ape grabbed his arrows to show off. He ordered Yang Youji to shoot it. When [Yang] began to draw the bow and aim the arrow, [even] before he shot, the ape hugged a tree and shrieked. This is hitting the target before hitting the target. (16, tr. Major 2010:648) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Daoism===
Daoism, like Buddhism, paradoxically treats monkeys as both foolish and wise animals.

The (c. 4th-3rd centuries BCE) Daoist ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' illustrates the gibbon/macaque distinction (see Symbolism section).  The first story is about a ''jugong'' 狙公 "macaque/monkey trainer".
&lt;blockquote&gt;To weary the spiritual intelligence by trying to unify things without knowing that they are already identical is called "three in the morning." Why is this called "three in the morning"? Once upon a time, there was a monkey keeper who was feeding little chestnuts to his charges. "I'll give you three in the morning and four in the evening," he told them. All the monkeys were angry. "All right, then," said the keeper, "I'll give you four in the morning and three in the evening." All the monkeys were happy with this arrangement. Without adversely affecting either the name or the reality of the amount that he fed them, the keeper acted in accordance with the feelings of the monkeys. He too recognized the mutual dependence of "this" and " that." Consequently, the sage harmonizes the right and wrong of things and rests at the center of the celestial potter's wheel. This is called "dual procession." (chap. 2, tr. Mair 1994:16-17) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Zhuangzi tells a ''yuan'' 猿 "gibbon" parable to the King of [[Wei (state)|Wei]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;Master Chuang passed by the King of Wei wearing patched clothing made of coarse cloth and shoes tied together with twine. "How come you're so wretched, master?" asked the King of Wei. "It's poverty," said Master Chuang, "not wretchedness. When a scholar possesses the Way and integrity but cannot put them into practice, he is wretched. When his clothing is tattered and his shoes have holes in them, he is poor, not wretched. This is called, 'not having met with the right time': Has your majesty not seen the high-climbing gibbon? When it is on a nanmu, catalpa, or camphor tree [all tall, straight trees], the gibbon grasps the branches with its hands and feet or wraps around them with its tail, moving nimbly among them. Even Yi and P'engmeng [the famous mythical archers [[Houyi]] and his disciple] would not be able to take accurate aim at it. When, however, the gibbon is on a silkworm thorn, ramosissimus, thorny limebush, or matrimony vine [all short, thorny bushes], it moves furtively and glances sideways, shaking and trembling all the while. This is not because the gibbon's sinews and bones have become stiff and lost their suppleness, but because it finds itself in an inconvenient situation and cannot show off its ability. Now, if I am situated under a benighted ruler and confused ministers, and still wish not to be wretched, how could I be so?" (20, tr. Mair 1994:194) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Daoist discipline of ''[[daoyin]]'' "guide and pull" is based on the notion that circulating and absorbing ''[[qi]]'' "breath; life force" in the body can lead to longevity or even immortality. Long-limbed animals were believed to be innately adept at absorbing ''qi'' and thus acquire "occult powers, including the ability to assume human shape, and to prolong their life to several hundred years" (van Gulik1967:38). For example, the (c. 4th century) ''[[Chunqiu Fanlu]]'' (tr. Van Gulik) says, "The gibbon resembles the macaque, but he is larger, and his colour is black. His forearms being long, he lives eight hundred years, because he is expert in controlling his breathing."

The ''[[Baopuzi]]'' lists animals associated with longevity, including (chap. 3, tr. Luo 2003:4124, cf. Ware 1967:56), "A macaque may evolve into an ape after 800 years. After another 500 years it evolves into Jue, and Jue will evolve into Chanchu (toad) after 1,000 years."

[[File:Guanyin, Monkeys, and Crane.jpg|thumb|Guanyin, gibbon, and crane scrolls, [[Muqi Fachang]], 13th century]]
Another animal associated with longevity was the ''he'' 鶴 "[[Crane in Chinese mythology|crane]]", whose long neck and legs supposedly enabled the bird to absorb ''qi'' and live up to a thousand years. 
The pair of ''yuanhe'' 猿鶴 "gibbon and crane", both of which were famous for their graceful movements, became a literary and artistic trope for a "long life". The (624) ''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'' encyclopedia quotes a ''[[Baopuzi]]'' story, not found in the received text, about [[King Mu of Zhou]] (r. 976-922 BCE). "When King Mu of the [Zhou] dynasty made his expedition to the south, his entire (routed) army was transformed. The "gentlemen" [君子] among his troops changed into gibbons or cranes, the "small men" [小人] into insects or grains of sand." (tr. Van Gulik 1967:39), noting that this widely quoted passage "sets up the gibbon as the gentleman among the primates – a position he has kept till the present day."

===Buddhism===
[[File:Buddha with monkey.jpg|thumb|A monkey offering honey to help feed the Buddha.]]
{{Further|Mind monkey|Horse in Chinese mythology}}
When Buddhism was first [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|transmitted into China]] circa the 2nd century CE, monkeys were already an ancient tradition in [[Buddhist texts]].

Sutras frequently quote the Buddha to use "monkey" similes. The ''[[Dhammapada]]'' (334, tr. Buddharakkhita 1990:102) says: "The craving of a person given to heedless living grows like a creeper. Like the monkey seeking fruits in the forest, he leaps from life to life (tasting the fruits of his kamma)."  The ''[[Samyutta Nikaya]]'' (12.61, tr. Bodhi 2000:595) says: "Just as a monkey roaming through a forest grabs hold of one branch, lets that go and grabs another, then lets that go and grabs still another, so too that which is called 'mind' and 'mentality' and 'consciousness' arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and by night."

Several of the ''[[Jataka tales]]'' describe the Buddha's past lives as a monkey or an ape (see the [[Four harmonious animals]]). For example, the ''[[Mahakapi Jataka]]'' or Great Monkey King.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the heart of a Himavat there was a large tree, which bore excellent fruits even bigger than the palmyra nuts having exceedingly sweet flavor; lovely hue and fragrance, which no man had ever seen or noticed before. This tree was also the abode of several monkeys; and the Bodhisatta was born as the king of those monkeys. He was much larger in size than his followers; and was more compassionate and virtuous than others. One day, the monkey king noticed that a branch of the tree had grown just over the stream. It alarmed him, because some of the fruits might drop in the stream, which then might get carried away to the man’s world; and the men would then certainly come to have all the fruits for themselves. So, he instructed the monkeys not to let any fruit grow on that branch if they wished to enjoy the fruits for a longer period. … [However, one piece of fruit fell and floated downstream, where it came into the hands of a king who] tasted it, and then remarked, "Nothing could surpass the flavor of this fruit". He then ordered his men to hunt for the tree in and around the river-bank which bore the fruit. Soon the king’s men found out the tree laden with such luscious and delicious fruits. When they saw the monkeys enjoying those fruits, which their king wanted to have so eagerly, they attacked the monkeys mercilessly with volleys of arrows.

Witnessing the approaching attacking royal soldiers the Bodhisatta jumped on a mountain peak, which the other monkeys were not likely to copy. There, in order to save his friends he seized a strong rooted tall cane with his legs and bending it towards the tree jumped back and caught hold of the branch of the tree. He then called upon the other monkeys to use him as a bridge to jump upon the mountain peak. Taking advantage of the situation all the monkeys jumped on the mountain and darted away quickly. The monkey king was, however, terribly bruised and injured by being trampled by his mates when acting as a bridge for them. Soon he swooned. The king watched the flight of the monkeys; and also the plight of the monkey king.  He was greatly moved by the exemplification of such insight; courage; valor; and sacrifice, which an animal had just displayed to save the lives of his subjects. The king then ordered his men to delicately bring down the unconscious ape and gently place him on a couch and to render the best possible first aid. When the great monkey regained his consciousness the king asked him to explain as to why did he endangered his life to save his subjects, who were rather meant to serve or sacrifice. Like a guru, he then said, "O King! Verily my body is broken but my mind is still sound; I uplifted only those over whom I exercised my royal powers for so long." And before the king could utter some words of praise for the great monkey; he found him dead. (tr. Varma 1999) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chinese Buddhists adapted and expanded upon these traditional "monkey" metaphors for human qualities. A famous [[Chan Buddhist]] example is the Chinese ''xinyuan'' "[[mind monkey]]", which is a Buddhist psychological metaphor describing "unsettled; restless; inconstant" mentality. The word ''xinyuan'' 心猿 "heart-/mind-monkey" is frequently combined with ''yima'' 意馬 "thought-/will-horse" in the [[four character idiom]] ''xinyuan yima'' or ''yima xinyuan'', reflecting the previously mentioned association between monkeys and horses (and a major motif in the ''Journey to the West'').

==Literature==
{{Further|Journey to the West|Monkey (novel)|Simians (Chinese poetry)}}
Monkeys are a traditional theme in [[Chinese literature]]. Besides the prominent "Monkey King" [[Sun Wukong]] mentioned above, gibbons and macaques are popular images in [[Chinese poetry]]. Van Gulik (1957:51) says nearly every Chinese poet who wrote from the 3rd to 7th centuries referred to the "graceful movements of the gibbon and his saddening calls". For instance, the Tang poet [[Li Bai]] wrote poems about gibbons 白猿 in the [[Qiupu]] 秋浦 region (in south-central modern [[Anhui]] Province).
:In [Qiupu] there are many white gibbons,
:Swirling through the trees as so many snow flakes.
:Pulling their young with them along the thin branches,
:Drinking they play with the reflected moon in the water. (tr. Van Gulik 1967:61)

A modern example is [[Robert van Gulik]]'s [[Judge Dee]] story "The Morning of the Monkey", published in ''[[The Monkey and the Tiger]]''.

==Symbolism==
[[File:Modus scribendi..JPG|thumb|''Method of Writing'', a scribe with an [[ink brush]] and a monkey with paper, from [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s 1667 ''China Illustrata'']]
Reflecting the simial likenesses among humans, monkeys, and apes, many languages symbolically use "monkey; ape" words in reference to people. English [[wikt:monkey|monkey]], for instance, can mean a "mischievous child", "person with minimal intelligence and/or bad looks", or "menial employee who does a repetitive job"; and [[wikt:ape|ape]] can mean "uncivilized person", "wild; crazy", or "imitate; mimic". Compare the Chinese words ''houzi'' 猴子 "monkey; mischievous/glib person", ''hour'' 猴儿 "monkey; endearing term for a child", and ''houjing'' 猴精 "monkey spirit; clever and roguish person".

[[Zhou dynasty]] culture symbolically contrasted the gibbon as "gentleman; sage" (''[[junzi]]'' 君子 or ''sheng'' 聖) and the macaque as "commoner; petty person" (''xiaoren'' 小人).
&lt;blockquote&gt;A sharp distinction was drawn … between the superior gibbon and the inferior macaque. The macaque, frequently coming down to inhabited areas to forage, and therefore often seen and easily caught, became a familiar sight in daily life. Trained macaques formed part of the performances of travelling showmen, amusing young and old alike by their clever tricks. The gibbon, on the contrary, inhabiting as it did the upper canopy of the primeval forest, rarely seen and extremely difficult to catch, was regarded as a denizen of the inscrutable, forbidding world of the high mountains and deep valleys, peopled by fairies and goblins. Accordingly, the macaque was the symbol of human astute trickery but also of human credulity and general foolishness; and the gibbon the symbol of the world of the supernatural, mysterious and remote from man's daily life. (van Gulik 1967:37) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
See the ''Zhuangzi'' stories (under "Daoism").

Eberhard (1968:52) describes a traditional Chinese literary motif that monkeys will sometimes seduce and impregnate women, who give birth to either a monkey-child or a monkey spirit. Thus, in the "popular mind", says Eberhard (1986:192), a monkey can also symbolize an adulterer.

==Art==
[[File:Yi-Yuanji-Two-gibbons-in-an-oak-tree.jpg|thumb|100 px|''Two gibbons in an oak tree'' by the [[Song dynasty]] painter [[Yi Yuanji]].]]
[[File:Marbleized Clay, Tri-Color Glazed of Monkey Piggy-Back on Horse.JPG|thumb|100 px|[[Sancai|Tri-Color Glazed]] figure of a monkey riding a horse, [[Tang dynasty]].]]
The earliest Chinese monkey-shaped objects (Geissemann 2008:1), believed to have been [[belt hook]]s, date from the late Eastern Zhou period (4th-3rd centuries BCE) and depict a gibbon with outstretched arms and hook-shaped hands. The oldest extant painting of a monkey is attributed to the Buddhist monk and artist [[Guanxiu]] (832-912). It shows a gibbon offering peaches to a ''Luohan'' 羅漢 "[[Eighteen Arhats|arhat]]", which (Geissemann 2008:6) says "firmly establishes this painting in a Buddhistic context".

Gibbons became a popular subject for Chinese painters (for example, [[Yi Yuanji]], fl. 1050-1075) during the [[Northern Song dynasty]], and then again from the [[Southern Song dynasty]] into the [[Yuan dynasty]], especially for the [[Chan Buddhist]] monk [[Muqi Fachang]] (1210?-1269?) (Geissemann 2008:6-7).

Monkeys are a frequent motif in modern [[Chinese art]]. Several examples (Eberhard 2003:193) are based on a visual pun between ''hou'' 侯 "[[marquis]]; count" and ''hou'' 猴 "monkey". Since ''mashang'' 馬上 literally means "on horseback" or figuratively "immediately", an image of a monkey riding a horse is called ''mashang fenghou''馬上封侯 "May you immediately be conferred the rank of marquis", which is a Chinese gift of congratulations for gaining promotion. Another [[visual pun]] showing one monkey crouching on the ''bei'' 背 "back " of another ''bei'' 辈 "generation" can be interpreted as "May you rank as marquis from generation to generation"; and a painting of two monkeys in a tree has the same signification.

Another frequent image is a monkey holding a peach, as in the 16th-century novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'', which refers to a legend that a monkey stole the [[peaches of Immortality]] from the garden of [[Xi Wangmu]] "Queen Mother of the West".

The familiar [[Three wise monkeys]] are a Japanese, rather than Chinese, pictorial maxim  to "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil". See [[Monkeys in Japanese culture]] for more information.

==Pharmacology==
Simians have played a role in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], "which maintains that the meat, bones and livers of monkeys have various curative effects, ranging from detoxification to improving sex drive" (Chen 2007). [[List of State-owned enterprises in China|Chinese state-owned]] medicine companies buy about 2 tons of monkey bones annually, estimated as "taken from at least 1,500 primates."

The (1597) ''Bencao gangmu'' lists pharmacological uses for four monkeys. The ''mihou'' "monkey; macaque" (Read 1931: no. 400B) is the most versatile.
*''rou'' 肉 "meat": "Pickled in wine it is good for chronic malaria, and all kinds of lassitude. It is prophylactic against malaria. In the south it is considered a delicacy smoked or salted." 
*''tougu'' 頭骨 "skull": "Ashed and given with wine for malaria. Boiled in water it is used as a bath for children in convulsions, and for feverish chills."
*''shou'' 手 "paw": "For children in convulsions."
*''shi'' 屎 "feces": "Applied to spider bites. Ashed and given with honey to children in convulsions, and for colic."
*''pi'' 皮 "skin": "To treat infectious diseases in horses. A female monkey kept in the stable of a horse is most effective. The menstrual fluid [''houjing'' 猴經] shed on to the straw is eaten by the horse and the latter gets a lasting immunity against infectious disease."
The meat and blood of a ''rong'' 狨 "gibbon" (1931: no. 401B) are used for [[anal fistula]], and the fat for [[scabies]]. Read notes "The placenta, liver, and bile of the gibbon are used in Japanese Domestic medicine." The meat of a ''guoran'' 果然 monkey (Read 1931: no. 402) is prescribed for malaria and chills. The meat of a ''xingxing'' 猩猩 monkey (1931: no. 403) supposedly "cures drowsiness and hunger, and desire for a cereal diet, it allows an exhausted man to travel well, and old age will not tell on him". This refers to the [[Daoist]] ''[[Bigu (avoiding grains)|bigu]]'' "avoiding grains" fasting technique associated with achieving ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' "transcendence; immortality".

==Cuisine==
[[File:Monkey brains.jpg|thumb|250px|Simulated monkey brains displayed at the [[Tao Heung Foods of Mankind Museum]] as part of a [[Manchu Han Imperial Feast]]]]
Monkey meat, as mentioned above in the ''Bencao gangmu'', was traditionally considered both a medicine and a delicacy in [[Chinese cuisine]]. 

Several [[Chinese classics]] record the practice. The ''Lüshi chunqiu'' (tr. Knoblock and Reigel 2000:310) lists roast "lips of the ''xingxing'' ape" among the five finest meats. The ''Yiwuzhi'' (tr. Eberhard 1968:51) records a "special soup made of monkey head was typical for southern peoples." The ''Huainanzi'' (19, tr. Major et al 2010:784) has a story about eating monkeys: "A man from Chu had some boiled monkey meat that he gave to his neighbors. They thought it was dog meat and found its flavor pleasing. Later, when they heard it was monkey, they knelt down and vomited all they had eaten. This was a case of not even beginning to know about flavor."

Eating [[Monkey brains (cuisine)|monkey brains]], ''hounao'' 猴腦, is a controversial practice.  [[Qing dynasty|Qing emperors]] ate monkey brains during feasts known as the [[Manchu Han Imperial Feast|Manchu Han Imperial banquet]] (Gayley 2017: 42). According to Stephen Chen, the son of chef [[Joyce Chen (chef)|Joyce Chen]], Qing emperors "were partial to scooping out the brain of a living monkey for a tasty treat, and the practice continues to this day, particularly in some southern provinces" (2007).

Modern day official Chinese policy with regards to the [[procurement]] of certain monkeys for food makes their consumption illegal, with sentences of up to 10 years in prison for violators (Li 2016: 76-77, 80).

==Martial arts==
[[Monkey Kung Fu]], or ''houquan'' 猴拳 "Monkey Fist", refers to several [[Chinese martial arts]] techniques utilizing monkey-like movements. Modern Chinese movies have popularized the [[Drunken Monkey]] style.

The monkey is a secondary animal style, besides the basic [[Five Animals]], or ''wuxing'' 五形 "Five Forms", of [[Tiger Kung Fu|Tiger]], [[Crane (martial arts)|Crane]], [[Leopard Kung Fu|Leopard]], [[Snake Kung Fu|Snake]], and [[Dragon Kung Fu|Dragon]].

The ''Huainanzi'' (7, tr. Major et al 2010:250) criticized yogic practices like the ''yuanjue'' 蝯躩 "gibbon leap": "If you huff and puff, exhale and inhale, blow out the old and pull in the new, practice the Bear Hang, the Bird Stretch, the Duck Splash, the Ape Leap, the Owl Gaze, and the Tiger Stare: This is what is practiced by those who nurture the body. They are not the practices of those who polish the mind [e.g., the Perfected]."

==Pets==
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Van-Gulik-and-Bubu-page-109.png|thumb|[[Robert van Gulik]] with a baby gibbon Bubu]] --&gt;
{{Further|Pet monkey}}

The history of [[pet monkey]]s in China goes back at least to the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771-476 BCE).

The scholar Robert van Gulik, who was a great [[animal fancy|fancier]] of gibbons, wrote (1967:14), "there is only one objection to keeping a gibbon as pet, namely that one is liable to become too fond of it, and cannot bear to part after one's pet has reached maturity."

The ''Huainanzi'' (2, tr. Major et al 2010:107) mentions caging a gibbon, "If you put an ape in a cage, it will be just like a pig. It is not that it is no longer clever or agile but that it has nowhere to give free rein to its ability." The text (16, tr. Major et al 2010:639) also mentions a beloved pet gibbon, "The king of Chu lost his [pet] ape, and [to recapture it] he destroyed every tree in the forest." This was likely [[King Gong of Chu]] (r. 590-560 BCE) who is identified with a related story (16.89, tr. Major 2010:648) concerning "The king of Chu had a white ape" that could catch arrows shot by archers.

==Other==
[[Traditional Chinese holidays]] include the [[Monkey King Festival]] celebrated on the 16th day of the 8th lunar month, and the [[Birthday of the Monkey God]], celebrated in Singapore on the 16th day of the 1st lunar month.

[[Nanwan Monkey Island]] is a nature reserve in Hainan, China.

"Monkey" is also a popular name for foodstuffs including [[Chinese tea]]s:
*[[Baimao Hou]] 白毛猴 "white-haired monkey" is a type of [[green tea]] originating from the [[Wuyi Mountains]] in [[Fujian]] Province
*[[Houkui tea]] 猴魁 "monkey chief" is a type of green tea originating from Taiping County in [[Anhui]] Province
*[[Golden Monkey tea]] or ''jinhou cha'' 金猴茶 is a type of [[black tea]] originating from the Fujian and [[Yunnan]] Provinces

In [[feudal law]], '''Nulle terre sans seigneur''' is the principle that one provides services to the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] (usually serving in his [[army]]) for the right to receive land from the sovereign.  Originally a maxim of feudal law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Black's Law Dictionary |publisher=West Publishing Co. |place=St. Paul, Minnesota |date=1891-2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it applies in modern form to paying [[Land tax|rates or land tax]] for land of former [[Feudal system|feudal]] or feudal-like origin such as land with modern [[fee simple]] title, as opposed to land with [[Allodial title|allodial]] or [[Udal title|udal]] title.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In the original [[French language|French]] the expression means "No land without a lord" though the legal sense might be more akin to "no property without a liege" since it was at the basis of the link between the infeodated or [[nobility|feal]] and his [[Allegiance|liege]], in the feudal system.

'''Operation Catalonia''' (''Operació Catalunya'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is the name of a covert police operation allegedly driven by the [[government of Spain]] which aimed to curb the [[Catalan independence|Catalan independence process]]. The operation consisted of research and information gathering about [[Catalan independence]] politicians without judicial authorization.
The operation allegedly included the creation or use of false evidence, data manipulation, irregular reports, secret agents, leaks to the press and the use of threats to obtain confidential information.

The operation allegedly started after the [[2012 Catalan independence demonstration]]. The heads of the National Police started an extra-judicial operation that was kept secret even within the corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Corporació Catalana de Mitjans Audiovisuals|title=Operació Catalunya|url=http://www.ccma.cat/tv3/alacarta/30-minuts/operacio-catalunya/video/5668500/|accessdate=April 12, 2018|agency=CCMA|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation consisted of investigating and compiling information from politicians that were favorable to the independence of [[Catalonia]] without any judicial authorization. To do this, two methods were allegedly used: a special and secret unit of the [[National Police Corps]], depending on the [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)]], and also through the Spanish embassy in Andorra, dependent on the spanish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation (Spain)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation]].

== History of the case ==
On July 6, 2016, the Ex-Commissary of the National Police Corps, José Manuel Villarejo, revealed in court that he worked with former head of the internal affairs unit, Marcelino Martín Blas, to stop the pro-independence movement. Villarejo admitted that he was in charge of "investigating crimes", while Martín Blas was devoted to "appointments", "stories" and "finding sources". 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Villarejo admits that there was an "operation Catalonia"|url=https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20160706/villarejo-reconoce-trabajo-operacion-catalunya-5251375|accessdate=April 12, 2018|publisher=El Periodico|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also said that among the sources that Martín Blas had used there was the former head of the Anti-Fraud Office of Catalonia, Daniel de Alfonso, who also appeared in the recordings released earlier of the two meetings held in October 2014 with the Spanish interior minister, [[Jorge Fernández Díaz]], in which both allegedly conspired to seek evidence against pro-independence politicians.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police report confirms existence of ‘Operation Catalonia’ during Spanish Government's last term of office|url=http://www.catalannews.com/politics/item/police-report-confirms-existence-of-operation-catalonia-during-spanish-government-s-last-term-of-office|accessdate=April 12, 2018|agency=CNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2016 a police report was made public, signed by Marcelino Martín Blas, that confirmed the existence of the Operation Catalunya and which states that one of the duties of Commissary José Villarejo "during the last legislature was investigating "the Catalan independence process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A police report confirms that there was a 'Operation Catalonia'|url=https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20160711/informe-policial-dice-que-una-competencia-de-villarejo-era-el-proces-5256721|accessdate=April 12, 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2016, former president of [[Banca Privada d'Andorra]], Higini Cierco, reported that he had received pressure from members of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)]] and the heads of the national police to obtain banking information of some pro-independence politicians and their families. In particular, he assured that he had received threats and been blackmailed by Celestino Barroso, attaché from the Ministry of the Interior to the embassy of Spain in Andorra, and by Marcelino Martín Blas, Chief of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Spanish National Police .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Operation Catalonia opens a conflict between Foreign and Interior Ministries|url=https://www.eldiario.es/politica/actuacion-Andorra-conflicto-Exteriores-Interior_0_586542276.html|accessdate=April 12, 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The declaration of Cierco in Batllia compromises the Spanish embassy|url=https://www.diariandorra.ad/noticies/nacional/2016/08/20/l_ambaixada_espanyola_assenyalada_per_afer_pujol_105807_1125.html|accessdate=April 12, 2018|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andorra bank accuses Spain of blackmail to harm Mas and Junqueras|url=https://www.ara.cat/en/Andorra-Spain-blackmail-Mas-Junqueras_0_1635436574.html|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former lawyer of the Cierco brothers, [[Jaume Bartumeu]], confirmed the threats and extortions of the Spanish police in the Cierco. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bartumeu confirms the threats to Cierco and explains that it was he who informed Martin|url=http://www.ara.ad/politica/Bartume-amenaces-Cierco-comunicar-Marti_0_1634836597.html|accessdate=April 12, 2018|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 2016, the BPA case's Judge Canòlich Mingorance decided to notify the creation of two new causes as a result of the statements made by the Cierco brothers and sent an order to start a criminal investigation about the presumed threats and coercion exercised by the Government of Spain over the Managers of the Private Bank of Andorra to filter information that would undermine the independence process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andorra will investigate the Spanish police denounced by BPA|url=http://www.elpuntavui.cat/politica/article/17-politica/997835-andorra-investigara-la-policia-espanol-denunciada-per-bpa.html|accessdate=April 12, 2018|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 30, 2016 it was announced by the investigative commission formed by the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] that the Prime Minister of Spain, [[Mariano Rajoy]] participated in the operation. The president sent his head of Cabinet, [[Jorge Moragas]], and the Secretary of State for Commerce, Jaime García-Legaz, to Andorra to get the BPA owners to hand over bank statements, violating Andorran law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moragas, in the labyrinth of his operation Catalunya|url=http://www.ara.cat/politica/Moragas-laberint-seva-Operacio-Catalunya_0_1641436037.html|accessdate=April 12, 2018|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The parliamentary commission will propose to take Operation Catalonia to court|url=http://www.publico.es/politica/comision-parlament-propondra-llevar-operacion-cataluna-tribunales.html|accessdate=April 12, 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, 2017 the commission announced their intent to present a demand against the ten people under investigation for refusing to testify before the commission, all of them high ranking officials of the Spanish government. Doing so is a crime under Spanish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The commission of Operation Catalonia asks to sue against Rajoy|url=https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20170718/comision-operacion-cataluna-querella-mariano-rajoy-6176461|accessdate=April 12, 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 20, 2017 the investigation has reached impasse due to the blocking of any proposal in congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress concludes that the operation was in Catalonia but it will not take it to the public prosecutor's office|url=https://www.ara.cat/politica/Congres-conclou-existir-Operacio-Catalunya_0_1835816514.html|accessdate=April 12, 2018|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This lists people currently or previously included as part of the operation.
* [[Jorge Fernández Díaz]]: Operation Catalonia was carried out during his term as Minister of the Interior during which he commanded the National Police. The leaked recordings of his conversations with Daniel de Alfonso in October 2014 indicate that he directed the plot and that Rajoy was informed about it. With Alfonso, he reviewed which of the investigations by the anti-fraud office could be used against the parties of the pro-independence movement.
* [[Jorge Moragas]]: when he was head of the Spanish cabinet, Moragas sent several text messages to Victoria Álvarez to convince her to tell everything she knew about the Pujol family.
* Daniel de Alfonso: while he headed the Antifraud Office of Catalonia (2011–2016) he met with Fernández Díaz in Madrid to discuss what were the best tools they had for disassemble the political side of the independence movement. He also contracted Giménez Raso and Redondo Rodríguez using state funds, they are linked to José Manuel Villarejo and the operation.
* Eugenio Pino: while he was the assistant deputy director of the National Police Corps, he  considered to have been the puppeteer who really moved the strings of the operation within the police. Martín Blas, Fuentes Gago and, in theory, even Villarejo followed his orders. He is now retired.

* José Manuel Villarejo: alias "Manuel Villar", retired commissary of the National Police Corps of Spain, is the only one who has admitted the existence of the operation of Catalonia – without mentioning it by name – for which he affirms to have worked through private companies that he combined with his position in the police. He's been in a feud with Martín Blas, since he tried to involve him in the Emperador case. He would have also pressured Victoria Álvarez to present a demand.
* Rafael Redondo Rodríguez: private detective and lawyer, partner of commissary Villarejo, with whom he shares a position or a directive position in eight companies, and thirteen with the son of the commisary. He also accompanied Victoria Álvarez to testify in Madrid to demand Pujol.

He has in an open dispute with Villarejo, who considers him a man of the [[Centro Nacional de Inteligencia]], with whom he is also confronted. He traveled to Barcelona with Olivera in 2012 to try to persuade the prosecutors Bermejo and Sánchez Elled to reactivate the investigation of the Millet case, with a draft of an apocryphal report, and to search the CDC headquarters. After not accomplishing it, the draft was leaked, based on information extracted from the internet.

The lunch was secretly recorded and was later leaked to the media.
* Alícia Sánchez-Camacho: while she was the president of the Catalan PP, she knew the irregularities of the Pujol family, at least three years before they were taken to the courts, following the lunch at La Camarga with Álvarez. There she told him that she had good contacts with the police and that she reported everything to Rajoy and Moragas. Despite assuring that she did not know she was being recorded by the private detective agency Método 3, she stopped the judicial process against the detective agency with an agreement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7887">In [[Hong Kong]]'s [[List of higher education institutions in Hong Kong|universities and higher education institutions]], '''orientation camps''' ({{zh|迎新營}}), also known as “Ocamp”, are held by different student organizations in order to welcome new students before their first academic year. There are different types of orientation camps. “Big ocamps” (大O) are organized by the [[students' union]] or constituent colleges, while “small ocamp” (細O) are usually organized by faculty or departmental societies with a view to welcome students who study in the same faculty. The duration of ocamps is usually two to seven days.

The aim of organizing Ocamps is to enable freshmen in meeting new friends through getting along with a group of freshmen in the camp. Also, it aims to let freshmen understand and then adapt to the lifestyle and culture in university. It also boosts the sense of belongings of students to the university. Furthermore, some Ocamps like to spread messages to students, for example, standing up against injustice etc.

== History ==
There is no accurate information about the first orientation camp in Hong Kong but the earliest ocamp recorded was in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;The University of Hong Kong, ''Growing with Hong Kong: The University and Its Graduates-The First 90 Years'', 2002, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; held by [[University of Hong Kong]]. Then other universities started organizing it following Hong Kong University.

== Group Mother and Father ==
In each group, there will be two to four group leaders, mostly voluntary senior students (Year 2 or above) and also some alumni. They are known as “Group Mother” (組媽) and “Group Father” (組爸)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ant/hka/vol3/HKAS_2009_1.pdf Negotiating Rebellion: Obscene Poems of Chinese University Orientation Camp]'', Jimmy Tsz Hsien YUAN, 2009, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; as their role in the groups is to take care of the freshmen, i.e. the “group sons” (組仔) and “group daughters” (組女). They also have to design and create some handy gifts to the freshmen such as bags, hand fans and bracelets, which represent their groups.

== Dem Beat ==
''Dem beat'' (demonstration of beat), also known as ''dem cheers'' in some universities, means shouting slogans with a certain beat or rhythm created by claps and steps. All groups (either as university houses or colleges) have their own beat. The aim of this activity is to promote team spirit and togetherness.

== Campfire ==
[[File:Campfire in Ocamp.jpg|thumb|Students forming a circle surrounding the fire.]]

“Campfire” is held at night in which house captains start a fire together with torches and then all participants form a circle surrounding the fire and dance with music. Some common songs are ''[[My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean]]'', ''[[Dschinghis Khan (song)|Dschinghis Khan]]'' (Cantonese version) and ''Pieces of Sea Wave and Spray''. Before the activity ends, captains will share their feelings towards the camp.

== Game ==

===Situation Game===

Situation Game, known as  “Sit. Game”, in which committees of the camp first gather all participants in a venue, usually a sports centre. The committees deceive the participants by creating a situation that all group leaders have to leave the camp immediately. Group leaders sometimes cry in front of the participants to make the situation more convincing.  They then ask freshmen to speak out if there is any solution towards the situation. Before the committees announce the truth, they let participant enjoy their “last moment” with their leaders. Situation Game aims to teach and encourage participants to stand out and give voice to unfairness. Besides, it consolidates the relationship in groups including participants and group leaders.

[[File:Water game in Ocamp.jpg|thumb|Students playing with each other at the beach.]]

===Hong Kong Hunt===
Students are required to complete different tasks set by the committee as they run around in the city in limited time. By completing each task, students can get a certain score. At the end of the day, the team getting the highest score will be crowned the champion.

===Water Game===
Water game (水戰) is a common game in orientation camp. It is the game playing with water such as playing in the beach or playing with water guns. Participants will absolutely get wet.

===Room Game===
As a pastime after the conclusion of all planned activities in a day, “room games" (房 Game) are often played. Room games often last overnight. Participants will follow committees' instructions and play. Usually the games involve some penalties for the losers.

Popular room activities include "First Impression".

== Controversy ==
In recent years, orientation camp has sparked controversy owing to the games played there as criticized for ethical problems.

For example, in 2004 [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]]'s Health and Social Sciences Faculty freshmen were asked to kiss strangers on the lips, some of whom might develop a bad feeling during such an activity.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.scmp.com/article/468175/complaints-over-orientation-camp-sex-games Complaints Over Orientation Camp Sex Games]'', South China Morning Post, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides, games requiring close contact between the participants have been long described as being obscene and having too much intimacy. These include the “caterpillar game” as both the girls and boys in participation are required to wrap their legs around one another's waist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-sun.on.cc/cnt/news/20130922/00407_027.html|title= Chinese: 科大生胯下拖手玩「毛毛蟲」(HKUST students playing the "caterpillar game")|publisher=The Sun|year=2013|accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the ‘jumbo’ held by students at [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] (HKUST) in 2013, where the females were asked to lay down above the male's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-sun.on.cc/cnt/news/20130921/00407_032.html|title= Chinese: 科大迎新營淫招盡出 (HKUST's ocamp with obscene events)|publisher=The Sun|year=2013|accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities of cheers have also been condemned by some mass media for the inappropriate slogans used by students, which simply aim to verbally abuse the others. For example, in 2002, in the ocamp held by the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (CUHK), students from [[Shaw College (Hong Kong)|Shaw College]] slandered girls from [[New Asia College]] with the use of chants. Some wordings were said to be even discriminating the disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.singtao.ca/vancouver/2013-09-08/headline1378635184d4687993.html|title=Chinese: 中大迎新營 涉淫口號遭抨 (CUHK's ocamp being criticized for obscene slogans)|publisher=Sing Tao Daily|year=2013|accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://std.stheadline.com/archive/fullstory.asp?year1=2002&amp;month1=9&amp;day1=6&amp;month2=9&amp;day2=6&amp;id=20020906g01&amp;keyword1=&amp;keyword2=|title=Chinese: 迎新口號歧視殘疾種族 (Ocamp's slogans with discrimination against the disabled)|publisher=Sing Tao Daily|year=2002|accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a daily news article, the Chairperson of Joint Committee on New Student Orientation of CUHK, Kenneth W.Y. Leung, responded that the committee will explain the problems instead of launching a censorship as they believe the self-discipline of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-sun.on.cc/channels/news/20050827/20050827023152_0001.html|title= Chinese: 迎新四院互罵 校方事前默許 意淫口號響徹中大 (Obscene slogans: The School in silence)|publisher=The Sun|year=2005|accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Racism in association football''' is the abuse of players, officials, and fans because of their skin colour, nationality, or ethnicity. Some may also be targeted because of their association with an opposing team. However, there have been instances of individuals being targeted by their own fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZfYh7n2qTMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Sport+and+National+Identity+in+the+Post-War+World#v=onepage&amp;q=darkie&amp;f=false |title=Sport and national identity in the ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Centre for the Sociology of Sport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/so/css/resources/factsheets/fs6.html |title=Fact Sheet 6: Racism and Football |accessdate=2008-02-17 |publisher=[[University of Leicester]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/8318117.stm |title=Police probe into abuse of Edu |publisher=BBC News |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Racism]] in association football has been most studied in the [[European Union]] and [[Russia]], although racist incidents have been reported abroad. In response to racist incidents at association football matches, in May 2013, [[FIFA]], the international governing body of association football, announced new measures to deal with racism in the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22728162|title=Fifa racism measures could see teams expelled or relegated|date=31 May 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018 [[Antonio Rüdiger]], the victim of racist abuse, stated that authorities needed to do more to deal with racism in the sport.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45970660&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==

====Senegal====
Prior to Senegal's 2018 World Cup match against Japan, players on the Senegal team were targeted by Alan Sugar, a British businessman. Sugar tweeted, along with a picture of the Senegal team: "I recognise some of these guys from the beach in Marbella”.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/sport/football/worldcup-2018/racist-tweet-likely-to-fire-up-senegal-against-japan-1.2241044|title=Racist tweet likely to fire up Senegal against Japan|last=AFP|date=2018-06-23|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tweet reached the news in Senegal and was published in multiple newspapers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/20/lord-sugar-under-fire-over-racist-senegal-world-cup-team-tweet|title=Alan Sugar under fire over 'racist' Senegal World Cup team tweet|last=Belam|first=Martin|date=2018-06-20|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar apologized after the incident, tweeting “I misjudged me [sic] earlier tweet. It was in no way intended to cause offence, and clearly my attempt at humour has backfired. I have deleted the tweet and am very sorry.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The tweet was seen as racism for comparing the Senegalese soccer players to the rest of the 1.3 billion other residents of the African continent.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== South Africa ===
During the 20th century until 1991, South Africa had segregation policies and segregated football leagues in which the South Africans designated "black" race were not allowed to play in the Football Association of South Africa.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Alegi, Peter and Chris Bolsmann. "From Apartheid to Unity: White Capital and Black Power in the Racial Integration of South African Football, 1976–1992." ''African Historical Review'', vol. 42, no. 1, January 2010, p. 1. EBSCO''host'',&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-1950s attempts by mainly South African blacks to integrate the sport were stifled by FASA. In 1961 the FASA was suspended by the International Federation of Association Football for not complying with desegregation policies. During 1963 the ban was briefly lifted until it was reinstated in 1964 and remained in place for 28 years. In 1973 the South African games were held, and attempts by the South African government to keep the games segregated and the teams racially determined and confined led to the International Federation of Association Football to pull its support from the event. They were drawn in due to the promise of it being a multiracial event, but upon discovering that the teams were racially determined and the sports events themselves had segregated attendance, FIFA backed out. The South African Football Association (SAFA) was formed in December 1991 right before the end of Apartheid on South Africa, and has no racial requirements for play and entry.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Tunisia ===
Following the defeat of Tunisia's national football team to Equatorial Guinea in the African National Cup, at least twelve attacks were reported to have occurred in the capital and the southern city of Sfax. Some of these attacks were even against darker skinned Tunisians due to their resemblance to the sub-Saharan country. This was extended to social media through posts which focused on enslaving blacks and letting them be killed by Boko Haram, a radical group.&lt;ref&gt;The Associated, Press.

===Zambia===
Hanif Adams, the owner of [[Lusaka Dynamos F.C.|Lusaka Dynamos]], was subject to racist remarks due to his Indian heritage while running for president of the [[Football Association of Zambia]] (FAZ). Some individuals have been cited saying that a foreigner should not run FAZ. An individual when asked for reasoning stated that, "For the sake of national pride and patriotism, Faz should be run by indigenous black Zambians and not Indians or Pakistanis." Lusaka Dynamos neglected to back down from the race and told BBC Sport, "I am very disappointed for people bringing race issues into matters of football or any matter concerning the development of any country..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kennedy |last=Gondwe |title=Faz presidency marred by racial abuse. |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/7262763.stm |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=25 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==
Football racism and violence have decreased considerably during the 1990s through appropriate legislation such as the Football Offences Act (1991) which made racist chanting unlawful. However, racist chanting has not completely disappeared and much current abuse is linked to Asians, resulting in many still feeling intimidated. Institutionalized racism plays a large part in reducing prospects for footballing recruits from Asian communities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;McGuire, Brendon, et al. "Young Asian Males: Social Exclusion and Social Injustice in British Professional Football." ''Culture, Sport, Society'', vol. 4, no. 3, November 2001, p. 65. EBSCO''host''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Bains and Patel, it was recorded that over 90 percent of the Asian Heritage respondents saw both institutional racism and the existence of racist supporters as being barriers to entry into the professional game.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Johal, Sanjiev. "Playing Their Own Game: a South Asian Football Experience." ''Race', Sport and British Society'' (2001): 153-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Many cases of segregation have been recorded resulting in many Asians playing in 'Asian only leagues', thus distancing themselves further from mainstream society and popular culture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Saeed, Amir and Daniel Kilvington. "British-Asians and Racism within Contemporary English Football." Soccer &amp; Society, vol. 12, no. 5, September  2011, pp. 602-612. EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt; Subjection to overt racist abuse from coaches, players and spectators is a primary common denominator for many Asian footballers leading to feelings of isolation and exclusion from after-training socializing and ritual young male bonding.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Researchers who wrote the ''Asians Can't Play Football'' report somewhat presciently uncovered a culpable order of ignorance and thinly disguised racism that had proscribed any sustained South Asian progression in the game.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Numerous problematic stereotypes still have a firm hold over the Asian identity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The standard stereotype of South Asian people is one of the submissive, naturally placid and physically frail individual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been stated that the Asian build is not that of a footballer and that the stereotype of "weak Asian" is influenced by notions of 'race' and issues of national identity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Common stereotypes list the Asian pupil as typically seen as physically frail, lacking in stamina and likely to underachieve.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 'Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) survey highlighted that there were only 10 Asian players at Premier League academies' 48 and in 2006, there were 'only four Asian players in the professional game'. These stereotypes exist because there is an under-achievement and if they subsist, 'scouts, coaches, and managers' will not visit places of high Asian population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; What unites most South Asian teams is the common experience of racism and a particular racism that is parasitically exacted through football.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There were reports of targeted racial attacks against the [[Philippines national football team|Philippine national team]] while they competed at [[Mongkok Stadium]] in a friendly against [[Hong Kong national football team|Hong Kong]]. The event was held on 4 June 2013. Hong Kong fans reportedly called their counterparts "slaves", threw bottles at them and booed at the Philippine national anthem. Hong Kong lost the friendly match to the Philippines, 1–0. At the end of the game, Hong Kong fans reportedly threw debris at the Philippine team and gallery, occupied mostly by wives and children of the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.inquirer.net/103391/racist-issue-mars-azkals-win-vs-hk|title=Racist issue mars Azkals win vs HK|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benny Chan, spokesman of the [[Hong Kong Football Association]], announced that the football body will release an official report to FIFA and the public after its investigation is completed. Philippine football officials are likewise waiting for the report before filing a complaint to FIFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.ph/sports/football/news/hkfa-probes-claims-of-racist-abuse-in-home-friendly-against-azkals|title=HKFA probes claims of  'racist abuse' in home friendly against Azkals - SPIN.PH|date=24 September 2014|work=Sports Interactive Network Philippines|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philippine Football Federation]] filed a complaint with [[GMA Network]] over a comment made by news anchor [[Arnold Clavio]] over controversial remarks directed at the [[Philippines national football team]]. A popular radio and television newscaster and program host of morning news show [[Unang Hirit]], Clavio was quoted as saying that foreign-born players are not Filipinos (emphasizing the fact that they were not born in the Philippines). Clavio later retracted this statement, insisting that he had not intended to offend anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/03/15/12/pff-files-complaint-vs-clavio-azkals-comment|title=PFF files complaint vs Clavio for Azkals comment|work=ABS-CBNnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another racial incident occurred during a friendly match between the Philippines and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] on 5 June 2012. A number of Indonesian fans were observed to be chanting "''Hindi kayo Pilipino!''" ("You are not Filipinos!") at Filipino players of non-Philippine ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/06/05/12/indonesian-fans-hurl-racist-abuse-azkals|title=Indonesian fans hurl racist abuse at Azkals|work=ABS-CBNnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
[[Federico Valverde]] was accused of making a racist gesture by pulling his eyes back into a slit when celebrating a goal, at the Under-20 World Cup in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Madrid midfielder denies celebration was racist after Korean outcry over controversial gesture|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/world-cup-u20-uruguay-federico-valverde-celebration-racist-korean-outcry-a7774101.html|website=Independent|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 World Cup, South Korea was a target of racism by Mexican television hosts following South Korea's win over Germany. After Germany's defeat, the two Mexican hosts, on-air, were seen pulling their eyes back into a slit. The hosts, following the incident, were fired by Telemundo, the television network they were employed by. After the same match, Mexican soccer supporters rushed to the South Korean embassy to celebrate. The supporters were also seen pulling their eyes back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44652806|title=TV hosts suspended over racist gesture|date=2018-06-29|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Europe==
{{See also|Racism in Europe}}In European association football, there is racism operating at the institutional and fan cultural levels. In England, the upper levels of authority are majority white and give jobs as coaches or other positions to other already-known white men rather than making public job postings. Stereotypes about coaches of colour, that they are more physical than intellectual, limit the accessibility of people of colour into the football industry. There are also legislative restrictions that limit the number of 'non-citizens' within a team in ⅓ of the countries in the EU, specifically targeting certain minorities. Therefore, there is 'invisible centrality of whiteness' that permeates the upper levels of the football system.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradbury|first=Steven|date=April 2017|title=Institutional Racism, Whiteness and the Under-representation of Minorities in  Leadership Positions in Football in Europe|url=|journal=Soccer and Society 14.3|volume=14|pages=296–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stereotypes also apply to the players and prevent them from being treated well during matches, as seen in the racist chants heard during matches. South Asian players are considered "static" and "homogenous" while black players are considered to be "'difficult', 'bad tempered' and 'lacking in social etiquette" by clubs in Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muller|first=Floris|last2=Van Zoonen|first2=L.|last3=De Roode|first3=L.|date=April 2017|title=Accidental Racists: Experiences and  Contradictions of Racism in Local Amsterdam Soccer Fan Cultur|url=|journal=Soccer and Society|volume=8|pages=335–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minority groups are expected to leave behind their cultural identities when joining a team and are encouraged to conform to the dominant norms perpetuated by white culture. And once the players are able to break into the system, it is difficult for them to work their way up into management or coaching. Within local areas such as Amsterdam, a sort of neighborhood nationalism develops that also contributes to this discrimination towards players of different origins.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There have been a few groups who have attempted to assuage the problem of racial discrimination in European football such as the UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) who held a seminar in Amsterdam encouraging racial equality in the industry with attendees from countries across Europe.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A campaign called 'Let's Kick Racism Out Of Football' was launched in 1993 in Britain to also increase awareness and facilitate dialogue about the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cleland|first=Jamie|last2=Cashmore|first2=Ellis|date=April 2017|title=Fans, Racism and British Football in the Twenty-First  Century: The Existence of a Colorblind Ideology|url=|journal=Journal of Ethnic and Migration  Studies|volume=40|pages=638–654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The move backfired after racist elements among PSG's crowd in the Kop of Boulogne sung "Come on the whites".

[[FC St. Pauli]] fans responded decisively to outbreaks of racism in the German game. With the slogan, ''Gegen rechts'' ('Against the Right'), a combination of fans and students took to the club's terraces in 1992 to protest against politically motivated racism.

In December 1992, all the teams in the German League followed the St. Pauli lead and, over one weekend, all players played in shirts displaying the slogan "''Mein Freund ist Ausländer''" ("My friend is a Foreigner"). The German Sports Youth's 1995 "No Chance for Hatred" campaign has promoted activities against racism and [[xenophobia]] on a national scale, encouraging local clubs to participate. This campaign has not spurred German football authorities into further action.

In 1996, Merkel 1996 reports that they vehemently refuse to acknowledge that racism is a major problem, and dismiss racist abuse as isolated incidents which are unrelated to the sport. Most of their measures are concerned with law and order&amp;nbsp;— reducing violence at matches&amp;nbsp;— but anti-racist action is very sparse.

Racism in German football is much more subtle than in other parts of Europe; [[monkey chanting]] have been replaced with codes, such as the number 88, which stands for "HH" or "Heil [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]" ("H" is the eighth letter of the alphabet in both German and English). Some teams, for example [[Hannover 96]], have banned such symbols from their stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,799673,00.html |title=Fighting Racism in the Soccer Stadium |accessdate=2008-08-05 |date=6 March 2003 |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |first=Andreas |last=Tzortzis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black footballers playing in the [[Serie A]] top flight in 1992–93 were also racially abused. Two black Dutch players, [[Ruud Gullit]] and [[Aron Winter]], have spoken out against such racist taunts. Their complaints spurred a day of action on 13 December 1992, with the slogan "''No al razzimo!''" ("No to racism") being paraded by all players in the two Italian divisions.&lt;ref name="Racism in European football"/&gt;

[[Paul Ince]] also complained about open abuse during his spell with [[Inter Milan]] in Italy between 1995 and 1997.&lt;ref name="Centre for the Sociology of Sport"/&gt;

On 27 November 2005, [[Marco Zoro]] attempted to stop the [[F.C. Messina Peloro|Messina]]–Inter match by leaving the field with the ball after being tormented by racist taunts from some Inter supporters. He was eventually convinced to keep playing by other players, notably by Inter's [[Adriano (footballer, born 1982)|Adriano]]. These facts then brought strong and unanimous condemnations by the whole football community within Italy, and a five-minute delay for an anti-racism display for all the matches to be played in the next week in the country. The actions of the Inter supporters were also brought to the attention of the European football governing body [[UEFA]] and the EU.&lt;ref name="Concerns raised over racism during Cup"/&gt;

===Poland===
According to [[The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism]], football stadiums in Poland are a recruiting ground for extremist organisations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2001-2/poland.htm |title=Antisemitism And Racism |publisher=Tau.ac.il |accessdate=2010-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404043228/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2001-2/poland.htm |archivedate=4 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polityka.pl/archive/do/registry/secure/showArticle?id=3346274 |title=Polityka&amp;nbsp;— Archiwum&amp;nbsp;— Artykuł |publisher=Polityka.pl |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until a few years ago,{{when|date=September 2017}} [[neo-fascist]] symbols were a common sight there.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mihir Bose |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/mihirbose/2008/04/polish_footballs_racism_proble_1.html |title=BBC Sport &amp;#124; Mihir Bose |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Extraordinary Congress of the International Football Federation (FIFA), held in [[Buenos Aires]] from 6–7 July 2001, the problem of racism in Polish football was discussed and Polish national football association was called to join the struggle against racism.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The problem of anti-Semitism in Polish football has drawn international criticism. Poland was named as one of the worst offenders, in British Member of Parliament [[John Mann (British politician)|John Mann]] report, which describes anti-Semitic incidents in 18 countries across Europe. It was noted that Polish fans routinely call each other "Jews" as a term of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1203847451790&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.
&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, [[ŁKS Łódź]] player [[Arkadiusz Mysona]] wore a shirt which said "''Śmierć żydzewskiej kurwie''" ("Death to [[Widzew Łódź|Widzew]]-Jewish Whore", which is word play used by the LKS Łódź  supporters, who call fans of their local rivals "Jews") after a match in the Polish [[Ekstraklasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport.pl/pilka/1,79005,5169217.html|title=Śmierć żydzewskiej k.....|accessdate=2008-06-27|date=30 April 2008|publisher=sport.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mysona said afterwards that the shirt was given to him by a fan and he hadn´t checked it.

Supporters of the football club [[KS Cracovia (football)|KS Cracovia]], from [[Kraków]], often refer to themselves as "Jews" in a positive manner, much in the same way as fans of [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in the Netherlands. In a manner similar to Ajax, the self-identification is related to the team's history; quite a few of the founders of both clubs from [[Łódź]] were Polish Jews.

The [[BBC Panorama]] program toured football matches in Poland before [[UEFA Euro 2012]], jointly held in Poland and Ukraine. The journalists recorded "a chorus of anti-Semitic chanting" and witnessed "black football players enduring monkey chants from the terraces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18192375 |title=BBC News - Sol Campbell warns fans to stay away from Euro 2012 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]'s [[Dalian Atkinson]] returned from Spain after one season with [[Real Sociedad]], unhappy with the reception he received and identifying racial abuse as a major factor in his rapid departure from the Spanish club.&lt;ref name="Centre for the Sociology of Sport"/&gt;

Ivorian midfielder [[Félix Dja Ettien]] suffered racial abuse when he first signed for [[Levante UD|Levante]] (where he stayed from 1997 to 2008); he was ignored by the coach due to his inability to speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and whenever he fell ill, he was accused of having [[malaria]] or [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/4019643.stm|title=Felix who?|accessdate=2008-02-17|date=17 November 2004|author=Phil Minshull|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a training session in 2004, a Spanish TV crew filmed [[Spain national football team|Spanish national team]] head coach [[Luis Aragonés]] trying to motivate [[José Antonio Reyes]] by making offensive and racist references to Reyes' then-teammate at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Thierry Henry]]. The phrase used was "''Demuestra que eres mejor que ese negro de mierda''", translated as "Show that you're better than that black shit". The incident caused uproar in the British media, with calls for Aragonés to be sacked. When Spain played [[England national football team|England]] in a [[friendly match]] at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]] soon after, on 17 November 2004, the atmosphere was hostile. Whenever black England players touched the ball, a significant proportion of the Spanish crowd began to make monkey chants, in particular to [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]] and [[Ashley Cole]]. Additionally, when England sang their national anthem before kick-off, Spanish fans also racially chanted against English players. Aragonés' remarks were widely blamed by the British press for inciting the incident. After an investigation into the events during the match, [[UEFA]] fined the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] 100,000 [[Swiss francs|CHF]] ([[United States dollar|US$]]87,000) and warned that any future incidents would be punished more severely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1798795,00.html|title=European Soccer's Racism Problem|accessdate=2008-02-17|date=2 December 2005|publisher=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident even drew reactions from then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Tony Blair]] and Sports Minister [[Richard Caborn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/spain/article/0,2763,1354973,00.html |title=Spanish apologise for soccer racism|accessdate=2008-02-17|date=19 November 2004|author=Paul Kelso and [[Giles Tremlett]]|work=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter making the claim that the behaviour of Spanish fans was 20 or 30 years behind that of their British counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Kelso |author2=[[Giles Tremlett]]  |title=Spanish apologise for soccer racism |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/nov/19/football.spain |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 November 2004 |accessdate=2008-08-05 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; UEFA noted that possible punishments could include suspension from major international tournaments or the closure of Spain home international matches to supporters. On 7 February 2007, Aragonés won an appeal over the offence, with the misdemeanour being downgraded to "conduct which could be considered to be racist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6338381.stm|title=Aragones wins Henry case appeal|accessdate=2008-02-17|date=7 February 2007|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, [[Samuel Eto'o]] received racially driven verbal abuse from some [[Real Zaragoza]] spectators during a match for [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. The fans began making monkey-like chants whenever Eto'o had possession of the ball and peanuts were hurled onto the pitch. Eto'o threatened to leave the pitch in the middle of the game, but was prevented by the intervention of his teammates and the referee, who rushed to the pitch to calm him down. His black teammate [[Ronaldinho]], who has suffered similar abuses but less intensely, said he was fed-up with the sounds and that if Eto'o had left the pitch, he would have done the same. As Barcelona won 4–1, Eto'o danced like a monkey, saying rival fans were treating him as a monkey.&lt;ref name = "Eto'o responds to racist abuse"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/4261881.stm |title=Eto'o responds to racist abuse|accessdate=2008-02-17|date=13 February 2005|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referee Fernando Carmona Méndez did not mention the incidents in his match report, commenting only that the behaviour of the crowd was "normal".&lt;ref name="Eto'o responds to racist abuse"/&gt;  The fans were identified to police by fellow spectators and they were fined and banned from attending sporting events for five months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/4104067.stm|title=Two fined for Eto'o taunts|accessdate=2008-02-17|date=17 December 2004|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eto'o declared in the aftermath that the punishment was insufficient and that [[La Romareda]], Real Zaragoza's stadium, should have been closed for at least one year.

In 2004, [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] became the first club to be charged by The Football Association over racist behaviour by their fans.

In 2004, during a friendly match with Spain, English fans chanted racist comments towards the Spanish team and fans. This incident was widely condemned by the British government. This incident, although not a new manifestation, brought greater awareness in England to the problem of racism in sports.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajcgermany.org/atf/cf/%7B46AEE739-55DC-4914-959A-D5BC4A990F8D%7D/DB%20Racism%20in%20European%20Soccer%20-%20for%20ajc.pdf|title=Antisemitism and Racism in European Soccer|last=Pallade|first=Yves|date=May 2007|website=American Jewish Community|access-date=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March 2007, it was announced that the [[Metropolitan Police]] were investigating apparent anti-Semitic chants by West Ham fans before the match with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] two days previously after a video of the offence surfaced on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/6422059.stm|title=Police probe Hammers racism claim|accessdate=2008-02-17|date=6 March 2007|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2007, in a match between [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] and [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], Gillingham keeper [[Kelvin Jack]] was racially abused by a Rotherham fan.

In November 2008, [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]'s Egyptian forward [[Mido (footballer)|Mido]] was subjected to [[Islamophobia|Islamophobic]] chanting from a small number of Newcastle fans.

During a [[2009–10 Football League Cup|League Cup]] match between [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] at the [[Britannia Stadium]] on 22 September 2009, Blackpool player [[Jason Euell]], who at the time was sat on the substitutes bench was racially abused by a Stoke fan, who was ejected from the stadium and subsequently arrested by [[Staffordshire Police]] before being released pending inquiries.&lt;ref name="gazette5683253"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/sports-news/Racist-fans-should-go-to.5683253.jp|title=Racist fans 'should go to prison'|date=28 September 2009|work=[[Blackpool Gazette]]|accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Euell confronted the supporter that was taunting him. Blackpool manager [[Ian Holloway]], who had to restrain Euell, was furious in his post-match interview, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We are human beings and Jason is a footballer. The colour of his skin shouldn't matter. It was disgusting. The stewards believed what Jason said, got the bloke out and I hope he is banned for life. [He is] an absolute disgrace of a human being. I thought those days had gone. Jason was just sat in the dugout at the time. I saw his reaction and I had to calm him down. It's absolutely disgraceful.&lt;ref name="gazette5670407"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/sports-news/Holloway-slams-39disgusting39-attack.5670407.jp|title=Holloway slams 'disgusting' attack|last=Canavan|first=Steve|date=22 September 2009|work=[[Blackpool Gazette]]|accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Euell, who received an official apology from Stoke City, later said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It did hurt. I felt I had to stand up for all colours and creeds and show that we won't accept it. I'm proud that I made a stand. It was a shock to hear what came out of the guy's mouth. Racism in football is not dead and buried but it's still a shock to hear that kind of thing in close proximity. There were people near the idiot who didn't agree with it, but there were others who turned a blind eye, which was disappointing.&lt;ref name="guardian090924"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/24/jasone-euell-racism-blackpool-stoke-city|title=Jason Euell insists he has no regrets about confronting racist supporter|date=24 September 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=29 September 2009 | location=London}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the wake of the incident, Spurs manager [[Harry Redknapp]] called for fans who racially abuse players to be imprisoned: "That is disgusting&amp;nbsp;– there's no place for that in the game. Surely we can't have that sort of behaviour now? Anyone who does it should be put in prison&amp;nbsp;– not banned from football. Stick them where they belong, in the nut-house. It's wrong."&lt;ref name="gazette5683253"/&gt;

In April 2011, an initiative was launched by comedian [[David Baddiel]] to tackle anti-semitism in the sport, which was backed by players including [[Frank Lampard]], [[Ledley King]] and [[Kieran Gibbs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13086148.stm|title=Top players back David Baddiel's anti-semitism campaign|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=14 April 2011|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, two followers of [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] were arrested before the start of a game against [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] after racially abusing a young black Torquay player who was taking part in the pre-match entertainment.

A scandal took place during the 2018 World Cup qualifiers surrounding the match between Syria and Iran. The match was held in Kuala Lumpur during Monsoon season, making the match much more difficult and ending in a 0-0 tie. Iran then accused Syria of 'fixing' the game to prevent Iran from advancing to the World Cup.  This event shows the underlying racial tension between Syria and Iran and exemplifies how racial discrimination works its way into the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/blog/2016/11/28/conspiracy-and-heartbreak-this-week-in-middle-east-football|title=Conspiracy and heartbreak: This week in Middle East football|last=Levy|first=Uri|work=alaraby|accessdate=2017-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the game, Santos Laguna's fans had also chanted other racial slurs towards Baloy, including "''chango''" ("monkey") and "''come platano''" ("banana eater").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/noticia.php?id_noticia=23981 |title=Medio Tiempo, la casa del futbol en Prodigy MSN |publisher=Mediotiempo.com |accessdate=2012-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070629003126/http://www.mediotiempo.com/noticia.php?id_noticia=23981 |archivedate=29 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disciplinary commission of the [[Mexican Football Federation]] sanctioned the Santos club to a sum equivalent of 5,600 days of league minimum wage for the racist insults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Sasaki |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2006/08/22/racism-in-mexican-football/ |title=Racism in Mexican Football |publisher=Global Voices Online |date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racism went past the field in 2014 when Mexican politician, Carlos Trevino, called Brazilian football legend Ronaldinho an ape after he signed with a team in the Mexican league. He was quoted saying "I detest it all the more because people obstruct and flood the main avenues, causing me to spend two hours getting home … and all to see AN APE … A Brazilian, but an ape nonetheless. This has become a ridiculous circus." These outbursts were the reason why the Brazilian legend left the Mexican league after only one season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/15/mexican-politician-ronaldinho-social-media|title=Mexican politician causes outrage after racist post about Ronaldinho|last=Tuckman|first=Jo|date=15 September 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2017-04-24|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

Overt displays of racism at U.S. soccer matches are extremely rare compared to the EU and Russia, in part, because the fan base of soccer in the U.S. is ethnically diverse and much younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the18.com/news/how-diverse-soccer-united-states-really|title=How Diverse Is Soccer In The United States, Really?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during a 24 May 2008 [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) game between the [[Columbus Crew]] and the [[New England Revolution]], Revolution forward [[Kheli Dube]] (originally from Zimbabwe) scored a goal against the Crew in the 89th minute of the game. An unidentified fan in the audience shouted out a racist slur. The incident was subsequently posted to the video sharing website [[YouTube]], and MLS promised an investigation. In response to the epithet, Revolution player [[Shalrie Joseph]] reportedly made an obscene gesture towards the offending fan. Assuming that MLS could have identified the fan, Commisoner [[Don Garber]] promised to ban him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press |url=https://www.thestar.com/Article/432190 |title=MLS investigating fan's slur captured on camera |publisher=thestar.com |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-19 | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Goal.com Features |url=http://goal.com/en-us/news/145/goalcom-features/2008/05/30/716902/the-3-5-2-crewd-behavior-bad-yanks-and-mcreturn |title=The 3-5-2: Crewd Behavior, Bad Yanks and McReturn |publisher=Goal.com |date=30 May 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.mywire.com/a/AFP/US-soccer-promises-to-ban/6571332?extID=10051 |title=US soccer promises to ban racist fan&amp;nbsp;— if they find him &amp;#124; AFP &amp;#124; MyWire Reference |publisher=Mywire.com |date=4 June 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, two former (caucasian) coaches of MLS side [[Chivas USA]] filled a discrimination suit against the team. In this suit, they claimed that Chivas had become a racist squad after ridding themselves of most non-Mexican players and coaching staff following several unsuccessful seasons. After the allegations were presented to a wider audience on HBO's "Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel", MLS released a statement saying, "MLS has zero tolerance for discrimination or prejudice of any kind... And although allegations in this lawsuit raise serious issues it would not be appropriate for us to say anything more while the litigation is ongoing." Nothing significant happened following the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is This MLS Soccer Team Racist?|url = http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/chivas-usa-racist-soccer-team/story?id=19749008|website = ABC News|date = 23 July 2013|accessdate = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Major League Soccer releases statement concerning allegations of racism and discrimination at Chivas USA|url = http://www.thegoatparade.com/2013/7/29/4569558/major-league-soccer-releases-statement-chivas-usa-racism-discrimination-allegations-litigation|website = The Goat Parade|accessdate = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Watch HBO's Report on Chivas USA That Alleges Racial Discrimination at MLS Club [VIDEO]|url = http://worldsoccertalk.com/2013/07/24/watch-hbos-report-on-chivas-usa-that-alleges-racial-discrimination-at-mls-club-video/|website = World Soccer Talk|accessdate = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damien Perez of Arsenal de Sarandi labelled his opponent Jerry Bengston a "negro de mierda", roughly translated to "negro piece of shit". This is a common racial slur in Latin America.

'''Dr. Robert J.

He was sentenced to 12 years and 7 months in Federal prison.

Ahmed Bedier, a spokesman for the [[Council for American-Islamic Relations]] who worshipped at the Pinellas County mosque, alleged double standards in the treatment of Goldstein and argued that Goldstein should have been prosecuted as a terrorist, but prosecutors said the facts of the case didn't warrant such a charge.

On the afternoon of July 16, 2003, George Weller, then age 86, drove his 1992 [[Buick LeSabre]] westbound down Arizona Avenue in [[Santa Monica, California]] toward the city's popular [[Third Street Promenade]]. The last few blocks of the street, before it ends at the ocean, had been closed to vehicle traffic for the biweekly [[farmers' market]].

Weller's car struck a 2003 [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|Mercedes-Benz S430]] sedan that had stopped to allow pedestrians through a crosswalk, then accelerated around a road closure sign, crashed through wooden sawhorses, and plowed through the busy marketplace crowd, traveling nearly {{convert|1000|ft}} at speeds between {{convert|40|and|60|mph|abbr=on|-1}}. The entire sequence of collisions took at least 10 seconds.

By the time the car came to a halt, ten people had been killed and 63 were injured. Weller told investigators he had accidentally placed his foot on the accelerator pedal instead of the brake, then tried to brake but could not stop. Days after the crash, Weller issued a statement saying he was distraught and heartbroken, and his attorney called it an accident.

The crash fueled a national debate in the [[United States]] on safety risks posed by [[elderly drivers]].

Some observers questioned Weller's account; numerous witnesses and victims reported:
* Seeing no brake lights on Weller's car, which would indicate that he was not attempting to stop;{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
* Weller stared straight ahead as he drove through the crowd, with victims flying over his windshield;{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
* Weller angrily yelled from his car "Get out of the way!" as he hit pedestrians;&lt;ref name=NextEngine&gt;Eyewitness accounts from employees of NextEngine Inc. (2003-07-16 and 17)&lt;/ref&gt;
* That Weller avoided parked cars and produce tables on both sides of the road, steering instead directly down the middle of the crowded street;{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
* Weller did strike one vegetable stand, "sandwiching" victims with shelves and structural components from the stand;&lt;ref name="NextEngine"/&gt;
* Weller's car came to a stop after hitting two parked cars;&lt;ref name="NextEngine"/&gt;

Weller's supporters{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} argue that:
* Weller suffered from [[arthritis]], [[nausea]] as a side-effect of medication, and reduced mobility from a [[hip replacement]].
* Weller had a relatively clean driving record at the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]], with one minor crash and no violations. Weller had passed a vision test and written test on renewing his driver's license in November 2000.
* Since the tragedy resulted from a "misapplication" of the pedal, Weller had committed an accident, not a crime. "Pedal error cannot constitute negligence," stated Mark Overland, an attorney for Weller.

After he was found guilty of ten counts of [[vehicular manslaughter]], the sentencing judge noted that Weller "showed enormous indifference" and "unbelievable callousness."&lt;ref name=LAT052208&gt;{{cite web|author= Richard Winton and Martha Groves |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/22/local/me-market22 |title= Case is closed on deadly day at market |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 22, 2008 |accessdate=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This case became the inspiration for the [[South Park]] [[South Park (season 7)|Season 7]] episode "[[Grey Dawn]]".

==Aftermath timeline==
The day of the tragedy in Santa Monica, footage of a previous crash Weller had been in ten years earlier surfaced. While that crash was not fatal, he had driven his car off the road in much the same fashion as the Promenade crash and the footage was nearly identical in that it showed a confused Weller wandering around his crashed car in a heavily populated, public area. This further sparked debate surrounding what warning signs authorities should examine when dealing with driving privileges and the elderly.

On July 24, 2003, it was reported that state officials revoked Weller's driver's license.

On January 5, 2004, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office charged George Russell Weller with ten counts of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, carrying a penalty of up to 18 years in prison.  Weller's attorneys were ordered to surrender their client within 24 hours.

On January 6, 2004, Weller pleaded not guilty to the charges before Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Paula Adele Mabrey and was released on his own recognizance.

On January 14, 2004, victims and relatives filed suit against the City of Santa Monica and Bayside District Corp., organizers of the Santa Monica farmers' market, alleging that the crash could have been prevented by the installation of metal barriers.  Attorney Geoff Wells, representing victims and their relatives, remarked that "[The defendants] failed to take any reasonable steps to provide protection for the patrons at the farmer's market."

On October 25, 2004, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Katherine Mader convened a preliminary hearing to determine whether Weller would stand trial.

On November 3, 2004, Weller was ordered to stand trial, and his arraignment was scheduled for November 17.

On December 8, 2004, after a delay due to poor health, Weller was arraigned, again pleaded not guilty to the charges, and waived his right to a speedy trial.

On March 18, 2005, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert O'Neill denied a motion by Weller's attorneys to dismiss the manslaughter charges, remarking that "hitting the accelerator instead of the brake seems to me to be a clearly negligent act."

On October 20, 2006, by a unanimous verdict, jurors found Weller guilty on all charges, convicting him of vehicular manslaughter for killing 10 pedestrians.  The sentence was to be decided by the Court, with a maximum penalty of 18 years.

On November 20, 2006, Weller received probation on all counts after a judge determined that Weller was too ill to go to prison, where he would likely be a burden on prison authorities and taxpayers.  Weller was a month short of his 90th birthday.  He was also ordered to pay more than $100,000 in fines and restitution to the victims' families.

On May 22, 2008, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that the City of Santa Monica had thus far paid out $21 million to settle dozens of civil lawsuits stemming from the case.  The same article also noted that Weller, age 91, was now confined to his home and receiving 24-hour nursing care.&lt;ref name=LAT052208/&gt;

On December 9, 2010, George Russell Weller died at age 94, a mere two days after his 94th birthday.

'''Socrates Café''' are gatherings around the world where people from different backgrounds get together and exchange philosophical perspectives based on their experiences, using the version of the [[Socratic Method]] developed by founder Christopher Phillips. The groups model their discussions from the book of the same name by [[Christopher Phillips]] and a guide he also developed. Today, there are hundreds of such gatherings, coordinated by volunteers, worldwide.&lt;ref name="official-site"&gt;[http://www.philosopher.org/Socrates_Cafe.html Socrates Café official website], the official website of the Socrates Café movement&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Socrates Cafés began in 1996, when Christopher Phillips, then a freelance writer and editorial consultant, desired to in some way build on the legacy of historical thinkers. He proposed Socratic dialogues with anyone who wished to become more empathetic, and more objectively critical and creative philosophical inquirers.&lt;ref name="official-site" /&gt; Phillips' idea of having open-invitation meetings at cafes and other public places and spaces was inspired by [[Matthew Lipman]], the founder of the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children who advocated introducing philosophy into schools and under whom Phillips studied, as well as by [[Marc Sautet]], whose [[Café Philosophique]] Phillips became aware of after reading an article about Sautet in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[[Montclair State University]], ''Insight'', [http://www.montclair.edu/Publications/Insight/BackIssues/1997/Insight091597/Columns.html 15 September 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927055922/http://www.montclair.edu/Publications/Insight/BackIssues/1997/Insight091597/Columns.html |date=27 September 2011 }}; Bill Workman, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1998/05/21/MN79547.DTL "San Bruno Thinker Spurs Robust Chatter in Cafes"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 21 May 1998; both accessed 20 Oct 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Phillips, his version of the Socratic Method was inspired not only by the Greek interrogative elements practiced by Socrates of the ''elenctic'' (Greek for 'cross examination,' 'encounter,' 'inquiry'), ''aporia''  (Greek for 'doubt') and ''maieutic''  (Greek for 'midwifery,' in this case giving birth to ideas one harbors from within), but by the philosopher [[Justus Buchler]]'s notions of human judgment and query, by philosopher [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]'s notion of the "Socratic type" and view that the Socratic Method boils down to the sustained consideration of objections and alternatives to any given way of seeing things, as well as by [[Hannah Arendt]]'s notion of the Socratic persona and performativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Socratic Inquiry For All Ages|url = http://www.periodicos.proped.pro.br/index.php/childhood/article/view/1149|journal = childhood &amp; philosophy|date = 2012-06-10|issn = 1984-5987|pages = 131–151|volume = 8|issue = 15|language = en|first = Christopher|last = Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical Socrates Cafe group meets in a public place, is open to anyone who wishes to attend, and Socratically explores a question which is chosen by vote or which is announced shortly in advance. Typically there are no prerequisites, and no reading or other preparation is required. &lt;ref&gt;Socrates Cafe Society www.Meetup.com/Socrates-Cafe-Society&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socratic method==
Janet Sisson, a philosophy professor at [[Mount Royal College]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtroyal.ca/ProgramsCourses/FacultiesSchoolsCentres/Arts/Departments/Humanities/Faculty/jsisson.htm&lt;/ref&gt; has questioned the appropriateness of identifying the methods and goals practiced by Phillips with those of the historical [[Socrates]]:  "...the background for this enterprise [Socrates Café] is very different from that for the conversations of Socrates. [[Plato]] uses the figure of Socrates as a way of introducing the idea of intellectual discussion in order to promote the pursuit of truth, not as a path for personal discovery. ...To treat opportunities for dialogue as a means of self-discovery is a modern attitude, not the aim of Socrates own original dialectic.  American scholars have sometimes encouraged this reading of Socratic endeavors; Phillips' fondness for this line of argument perhaps owes more to idealist or [[Existentialism|existentialist]] thinking than to Socrates himself." Sisson goes on to stress that "(t)his does not undermine the aim of Phillips' cafes..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.bhg.org/books/books.php?type=de&amp;id=1718 Review of ''Socrates Café''], ''Metapsychology'', Vol. 7 No. 21, 25 May 2003, accessed 13 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Thomas V. Morris|Thomas Morris]] has praised the Socrates Cafe concept of good discussion about important topics by common people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas V. Morris|Morris, Thomas]]. [http://morrisinstitute.com/index.php?s=wisdom&amp;c=weekly_socrates_cafe The Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy], Morris Institute of Human Values, accessed 2008-10-13&lt;/ref&gt; David Blacker, professor of Philosophy of Education and Legal Studies at the University of Delaware, writes in ''Democratic Education Stretched Thin: How Complexity Challenges a Liberal Ideal (2007),'' that "one can...only applaud the efforts initiated by Christopher Phillips... In very much an extra-academic (but not anti-academic) spirit, Phillips has inspired individuals to create in their own communities voluntary groups who convene to discuss philosophical questions they themselves have chosen." ''(p. 146)'' Blacker considers the Socrates cafe endeavor to be a critical effort for evolving a democracy, the essential function and mission of which to him is for its citizens "to think for themselves about the lives they want to lead" (p.&amp;nbsp;146).

A '''Spanish Colombian''' is a Colombian of Spanish descent. Spain conquered the land now known as Colombia in the 16th century. Thus, its immigration is the most important to Colombia, whose official language is Spanish and its culture derived in great part from that of Spain.

== History ==
The Spanish arrived in Colombia in 1499 to conquer the land. They built several settlements in territories of the [[Chibcha]] Confederation and placed a new order of the territory according to the interests of each group conqueror. This ordinance responded to resources that were in the settlements, a process which is generally not taken into account the views of the people who lived there. These establishments continued for the next three centuries with an expansion and colonial warrior, besides introducing a large number of black African population as slave labor, progress on [[Amerindians|indigenous peoples]] and [[palenqueros]] that newspapers were subject to displacement.
In 1499 the Spanish explorer [[Alonso de Ojeda]] arrived on the coast of northern Colombia ([[Cabo de la Vela]]). In 1501 [[Rodrigo de Bastidas]] crossed the coast between [[Cartagena de Indias]] and [[La Guajira]] and [[Magdalena River]] discovered. In 1510 Alonso de Ojeda founded [[San Sebastián de Urabá]], the first Spanish settlement on the mainland, but that same year its provisional ruler, Francisco Pizarro, decided to leave and moved to a site in the Gulf of Urabá and founded under the direction of [[Martín Fernández de Enciso]] to [[Santa María la Antigua del Darién]]. This city, the capital of the first Spanish governor in the Castilla del Oro, was in turn abandoned in 1517. With Santa Marta (1525) and Cartagena (1533), established the Spanish control of the coast. The conquistador [[Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada]] entered a vast area in the central region of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]], conquering the powerful Chibcha culture, founding the city of Santa Fe de Bogota, Tunja ordering founding Gonzalo Suarez Rendon and naming the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] region.

To establish a civil government in New Granada created a Real Audiencia in Santa Fe de Bogota in 1548-1549. The Royal Court was a body that combined executive and judicial authority until the establishment of a presidency or governorship in 1564 assuming executive powers. Until 1550 the territory of Colombia was formed by the governors of [[Santa Marta]] and Cartagena, which were subject to the [[Audiencia of Santo Domingo]], and Popayan that was subject to the [[viceroyalty of Peru]]. The jurisdiction of the [[ Real Audiencia de Santa Fe de Bogotá]] include these governorates since 1550 and was extended in time over the surrounding provinces that were forming around the country corresponding to the New Granada.

In 1717 [[Santa Fe de Bogotá]] would become the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, although suspended in 1724 due to financial problems, was reinstated in 1740 and continued until the loss of Spanish power over the territories in the 1810s.

The [[paisas]] have been considered an isolated population, and therefore different. They are mostly of Spanish descent, because Spanish men who settled in the region during the 16th and 17th centuries were accompanied by their wives. The mountains isolated the population until the late 19th century, when entered in Antioquia industrial revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Bedoya G, Montoya P, Garcia J, Soto I, Bourgeois S, Carvajal L, Labuda D, Alvarez V, Ospina J, Hedrick PW, Ruiz-Linares A. Admixture dynamics in Hispanics: A shift in the nuclear genetic ancestry of a South American population isolate. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Apr 2, "Ancestro europeo de los antioqueños".&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], thousands of Spaniards fled from Spain to Colombia. Over the course of General [[Francisco Franco]]'s dictatorship many thousands more fled in fear of the regime. The Spanish republicans fled Franco's regime as well, seeking to escape retribution from the new government.

==20th century==
Before the 1930s children were routinely exploited in a variety of settings throughout American society. Frequently beginning their working lives before their tenth birthday, children worked in hazardous jobs at mines, mills, factories, sweatshops, and on farms, with little or no wages. [[Labor law]]s did not exist, and the common perception of the ease with which children were manipulated made them targets for a variety of rights violations.

In the 1980s the United States provided global leadership by acting as the "Tip of The Spear" among nations in crafting the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], or CRC. After the [[United Nations]] adopted the CRC in 1989, the United States became a signatory nation in 1994. However, to date the country has refused to ratify the Convention, joining only one other nation in the world with that status. Among the reasons the United States has failed to ratify the Convention is the fact that the Convention clearly states that anyone under the age of 18 is a child. The U.S. government has reservations about how that would affect matters when a 16- or 17-year-old commits a crime; currently, in certain instances, such a person can be tried as an adult in the U.S. courts.

The '''Turkic peoples''' are a collection of [[ethno-linguistic group]]s of [[Central Asia|Central]], [[East Asia|Eastern]], [[North Asia|Northern]] and [[Western Asia]] as well as parts of [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]]. They speak [[language family|related languages]] belonging to the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language family]].&lt;ref name="Turkic people"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/609972/Turkic-peoples Turkic people], [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They share, to varying degrees, certain cultural traits, common ancestry and historical backgrounds. In time, different Turkic groups came in contact with other ethnicities, absorbing them, leaving some Turkic groups more diverse than the others. Many vastly differing [[ethnic group]]s have throughout history become part of the Turkic peoples through [[language shift]], [[acculturation]], [[Interracial marriage|intermixing]], [[adoption]] and [[religious conversion]]. In their genetic compositions, therefore, most Turkic groups differ significantly in origins from one group to the next. Despite this, many do share, to varying degrees, non-linguistic characteristics, including certain cultural traits, some ancestry from a common [[gene pool]], and historical experiences. The most notable modern Turkic-speaking ethnic groups include [[Turkish people]], [[Azerbaijanis]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Kazakhs]], [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] and [[Kyrgyz people]].

Previous use of similar terms are of unknown significance, although some strongly feel that they are evidence of the historical continuity of the term and the people as a linguistic unit since early times. This includes Chinese records [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] referring to a neighbouring people as [[Beidi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.multimania.nl/kerkuk/ITP.html The Turkmen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318103736/http://members.multimania.nl/Kerkuk/ITP.html |date=2011-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, various Turkic peoples of the Eurasian steppe were subsumed under the identity of the "[[Scythians]]".&lt;ref name="G. Moravcsik, p. 236-39"&gt;G. Moravcsik, ''Byzantinoturcica'' II, p. 236–39&lt;/ref&gt; Between 400 CE and the 16th century, Byzantine sources use the name Σκύθαι (''Skuthai'') in reference to twelve different Turkic peoples.&lt;ref name="G. Moravcsik, p. 236-39"/&gt;

In the modern [[Turkish language]] as used in the [[Republic of Turkey]], a distinction is made between "Turks" and the "Turkic peoples" in loosely speaking: the term ''Türk'' corresponds specifically to the "Turkish-speaking" people (in this context, "Turkish-speaking" is considered the same as "Turkic-speaking"), while the term ''[[Turki|Türki]]'' refers generally to the people of modern "Turkic Republics" (''Türki Cumhuriyetler'' or ''Türk Cumhuriyetleri''). However, the proper usage of the term is based on [[Turkic languages|the linguistic classification]] in order to avoid any [[political]] sense. In short, the term ''Türki'' can be used for ''Türk''  or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Paul Roux]], ''Historie des Turks – Deux mille ans du Pacifique á la Méditerranée''.

The [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] clan migrated from Li-jien (modern [[Zhelai Zhai]]) to the [[Juan Juan]] seeking inclusion in their confederacy and protection from the prevalent dynasty. The tribe were famed [[metalsmith]]s and were granted land near a mountain [[quarry]] which looked like a [[helmet]], from which they were said to have gotten their name 突厥 (''tūjué''). A century later their power had increased such that they conquered the [[Juan Juan]] and established the Gök Empire.&lt;ref name="Carter V. Findley"/&gt;

Turkic peoples originally used their own alphabets, like [[Old Turkic alphabet|Orkhon and Yenisey]] runiforms, and later the [[Old Uyghur alphabet|Uyghur alphabet]]. Traditional national and cultural symbols of the Turkic peoples include [[wolf|wolves]] in [[Turkic mythology]] and tradition; as well as the color blue, [[iron]], and fire. [[Turquoise]] blue (the word ''turquoise'' comes from the [[French language|French]] word meaning "Turkish") is the color of the stone turquoise still used in [[jewelry]] and as a protection against the [[evil eye]].

University of California Press, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.kroraina.com/huns/mh/mh_6.html|title= Otto Maenchen-Helfen, Language of Huns|publisher= |accessdate= 18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the first millennium, mass-migrations to distant places were common, geographical borders were fluid and cultural identity was more likely to change dramatically during the lifetime of an individual, relative to the modern era. These factors also made it more likely that the Huns were, initially at least, closely related to the Turkic peoples.

In the 6th century, 400 years after the [[Han–Xiongnu War|collapse of northern Xiongnu]] power in [[Inner Asia]], the Göktürks assumed leadership of the Turkic peoples. Formerly in the Xiongnu nomadic confederation, the Göktürks inherited their traditions and administrative experience. From 552 to 745, Göktürk leadership united the [[nomad]]ic Turkic tribes into the [[Göktürk Empire]] on Mongolia and Cental Asia. The name derives from ''gok'', "blue" or "celestial". Unlike its Xiongnu predecessor, the Göktürk Khanate had its temporary ''[[Khan (title)|khans]]'' from the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] clan who were ''subordinate'' to a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] authority controlled by a council of tribal chiefs. The [[Khanate]] retained elements of its original [[Shamanism|shamanistic]] religion, [[Tengriism]], although it received missionaries of [[Buddhist]] monks and practiced a syncretic religion. The Göktürks were the first Turkic people to write [[Old Turkic]] in a runic script, the [[Orkhon script]]. The Khanate was also the first state known as "Turk". It eventually collapsed due to a series of dynastic conflicts, but many states and peoples later used the name "Turk".

Turkic peoples and related groups migrated west from [[Turkestan]] and present-day [[Mongolia]] towards [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Iranian plateau]] and [[Anatolia]] (modern Turkey) in many waves. The date of the initial expansion remains unknown. After many battles, they established their own state and later constructed the [[Ottoman Empire]].  The main migration occurred in medieval times, when they spread across most of Asia and into Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Carter V. Findley"&gt;Carter V. Findley, ''The Turks in World History'' (Oxford University Press, October 2004) {{ISBN|0-19-517726-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also took part in the military encounters of the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;Moses Parkson, "Ottoman Empire and its past life" p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Turkic peoples include the [[Karluks]] (mainly 8th century), [[Uyghurs]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] (or Ğuz) Turks, and [[Turkmens]]. As these peoples founded states in the area between [[Mongolia]] and [[Transoxiana]], they came into contact with [[Muslim]]s, and most of them gradually adopted [[Islam]]. Small groups of Turkic people practice other religions, including [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Jew]]s ([[Khazars]]), [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]].

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph.jpg|[[Al-Mu'tasim]]|thumb|right|upright=0.9]]
Turkic soldiers in the army of the [[Abbasids|Abbasid]] [[Caliphate|caliphs]] emerged as the de facto rulers of most of the Muslim Middle East (apart from [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]]), particularly after the 10th century. The Oghuz and other tribes captured and dominated various countries under the leadership of the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk dynasty]] and eventually captured the territories of the Abbasid dynasty and the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name="Carter V. Findley"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the Yenisei Kyrgyz allied with China to destroy the Uyghur Khaganate in 840. The Kyrgyz people ultimately settled in the region now referred to as [[Kyrgyzstan]]. The [[Bulgars]] established themselves in between the Caspian and Black Seas in the 5th and 6th centuries, followed by their conquerors, the [[Khazars]] who converted to Judaism in the 8th or 9th century. After them came the [[Pechenegs]] who created a large confederacy, which was subsequently taken over by the [[Cumans]] and the [[Kipchaks]]. One group of Bulgars settled in the Volga region and mixed with local [[Volga Finns]] to become the [[Volga Bulgars]] in what is today [[Tatarstan]]. These Bulgars were conquered by the Mongols following their westward sweep under [[Genghis Khan]] in the 13th century. Other Bulgars settled in Southeastern Europe in the 7th and 8th centuries, and mixed with the [[Slavs|Slavic]] population, adopting what eventually became the Slavic [[Bulgarian language]]. Everywhere, Turkic groups mixed with the local populations to varying degrees.&lt;ref name="Carter V.

As the [[Seljuk Empire]] declined following the [[Mongol invasions|Mongol invasion]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] emerged as the new important Turkic state, that came to dominate not only the Middle East, but even southeastern Europe, parts of southwestern Russia, and northern Africa.&lt;ref name="Carter V. Findley"/&gt;

The [[Delhi Sultanate]] is a term used to cover five short-lived, [[Delhi]]-based kingdoms three of which were of Turkic origin in [[medieval India]]. These Turkic dynasties were the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Delhi)|Mamluk dynasty]] (1206–90); the [[Khalji dynasty]] (1290–1320); and the [[Tughlaq dynasty]] (1320–1414). [[Southern India]], also saw many Turkic origin dynasties like [[Bahmani Sultanate]], [[Adil Shahi dynasty]], [[Bidar Sultanate]], [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]], collectively known as [[Deccan sultanates]].

In Eastern Europe, Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in 922 and influenced the region as it controlled many trade routes. In the 13th century, Mongols invaded Europe and established the [[Golden Horde]] in Eastern Europe, western &amp; northern Central Asia, and even western Siberia. The [[Cuman-Kipchak Confederation]] and Islamic [[Volga Bulgaria]] were absorbed by the Golden Horde in the 13th century; in the 14th century, Islam became the official religion under [[Uzbeg Khan]] where the general population (Turks) as well as the aristocracy (Mongols) came to speak the [[Kipchak language]] and were collectively known as "[[Tatars]]" by Russians and Westerners. This country was also known as the [[Kipchak Khanate]] and covered most of what is today [[Ukraine]], as well as the entirety of modern-day southern and eastern [[Russia]] (the European section). The Golden Horde disintegrated into several khanates and hordes in the 15th and 16th century including the [[Crimean Khanate]], [[Khanate of Kazan]], and [[Kazakh Khanate]] (among others), which were one by one conquered and annexed by the Russian Empire in the 16th through 19th centuries.
[[File:Khanate of Sibir.png|thumb|The Siberian Khanate (Sibir)]]
In Siberia, the [[Siberian Khanate]] was established in the 1490s by fleeing Tatar aristocrats of the disintegrating [[Golden Horde]] who established Islam as the official religion in western Siberia over the partly Islamized native [[Siberian Tatars]] and indigenous Uralic peoples. It was the northern-most Islamic state in recorded history and it survived up until 1598 when it was conquered by Russia.

The [[Chagatai Khanate]] was the eastern &amp; southern Central Asian section of the [[Mongol Empire]] in what is today part or whole of [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Xinjiang]] ("Uyghurstan"). Like the [[Moghulistan]] and Golden Horde, the Chagatai Khanate became a Muslim state in the 14th century.

The [[Timurids|Timurid Empire]] were an Uzbek-based Turkic empire founded in the late 14th century by [[Timurlane]], a descendant of Genghis Khan. Timur, although a self-proclaimed devout Muslim, brought great slaughter in his conquest of fellow Muslims in neighboring Islamic territory and contributed to the ultimate demise of many Muslim states, including the Golden Horde.

The [[Mughal Empire]] was a Turkic-founded Indian empire that, at its greatest territorial extent, ruled most of the South Asia, including [[Afghanistan]], Pakistan, India, [[Bangladesh]] and parts of [[Uzbekistan]] from the early 16th to the early 18th centuries. The Mughal dynasty was founded by a [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] Turkic prince named [[Babur]] (reigned 1526–30), who was descended from the Turkic conqueror [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) on his father's side and from Chagatai, second son of the [[Mongol]] ruler [[Genghis Khan]], on his mother's side.&lt;ref name="Mughal Dynasty"&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Article:[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9054153/Mughal-Dynasty Mughal Dynasty]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Article:[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011614/Babur Babur]&lt;/ref&gt; A further distinction was the attempt of the Mughals to integrate Hindus and Muslims into a united Indian state.&lt;ref name="Mughal Dynasty"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/taj_mahal/tlevel_1/t1_mughal.html|title=the Mughal dynasty|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/mogul/|title=Kamat's Potpourri|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Babur: Encyclopædia Britannica [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011614/Babur Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Afsharid dynasty]] was named after the Turkic Afshar tribe to which they belonged. The Afshars had migrated from [[Turkestan]] to [[Azerbaijan]] in the 13th century. The dynasty was founded in 1736 by the military commander [[Nader Shah]] who deposed the last member of the [[Safavid dynasty]] and proclaimed himself King of [[Iran]]. Nader belonged to the Qereqlu branch of the Afshars.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge History of Iran'' Volume 7, pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt; During Nader's reign, Iran reached its greatest extent since the [[Sassanid Empire]].

====Muslim Turks and non-Muslim Turks====

The Muslim Kara-Khanid Turks performed a mass conversion campaign against the Buddhist Uyghur Turks during the [[Islamicisation and Turkicisation of Xinjiang]].

The non-Muslim Turks worship of [[Tengri]] was mocked and insulted by the Muslim Turk [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]], who wrote a verse referring to them – ''The Infidels – May God destroy them!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Dankoff|title=From Mahmud Kaşgari to Evliya Çelebi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KaYZAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+Infidels+-+May+God+destroy+them+Turks&amp;dq=The+Infidels+-+May+God+destroy+them+Turks&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCGoVChMIg9Clz8KZyQIVx-MmCh3H1AhI|year=2008|publisher=Isis Press|isbn=978-975-428-366-2|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dankoff   |first= Robert |last2= |first2= |date=Jan–Mar 1975 |title=Kāšġarī on the Beliefs and Superstitions of the Turks |jstor=599159 |journal= Journal of the American Oriental Society  |publisher=American Oriental Society |volume=95 |number=1 |page=70 |doi=10.2307/599159  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muslim Kara-Khanid Turk Mahmud Kashgari insulted the Uyghur Buddhists as "Uighur dogs" and called them "Tats", which referred to the "Uighur infidels" according to the Tuxsi and Taghma, while other Turks called Persians "tat".&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20151118063834/http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/huri/files/viii-iv_1979-1980_part1.pdf p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute|title=Harvard Ukrainian studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KTYMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=aqtimiz+furxan+burxan&amp;dq=aqtimiz+furxan+burxan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAWoVChMI5feq24e_yAIVihY-Ch2RMQy0|year=1980|publisher=Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Kashgari displayed a different attitude towards the Turks diviners beliefs and "national customs", he expressed towards Buddhism a hatred in his Diwan where he wrote the verse cycle on the war against Uighur Buddhists.

Professor James A.

The Uyghurs of the [[Kingdom of Qocho|Qocho]] and [[Turfan]] – whose ancestors had adopted the Buddhism of the Tocharians when they settled in the Tarim – were forcibly converted to Islam during a ''ghazat'' (holy war) by the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] khan [[Khizr Khwaja]].&lt;ref name="Millward2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=James A.

===Modern history===
[[File:Map of independent Turkic countries..png|thumb|upright=1.55|alt=Map highlighting present-day Turkic countries|Independent Turkic states shown in red]]
The Ottoman Empire gradually grew weaker in the face of poor administration, repeated wars with [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and [[Austro-Hungary]], and the [[emergence of nationalist movements in the Balkans]], and it finally gave way after World War I to the present-day [[Republic of Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Carter V. Findley"/&gt;
Ethnic nationalism also developed in Ottoman Empire during the 19th century, taking the form of [[Pan-Turkism]] or [[Turanism]].

The Turkic peoples of Central Asia were not organized in nation-states during most of the 20th century, after the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] living either in the Soviet Union or (after a short-lived [[First East Turkestan Republic]]) in the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Chinese Republic]].

In 1991, after the disintegration of the [[Soviet Union]], five Turkic states gained their independence. These were [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]]. Other Turkic regions such as [[Tatarstan]], [[Tuva]], and [[Yakutia]] remained in the [[Russian Federation]]. [[Chinese Turkestan]] remained part of the [[People's Republic of China]].

Immediately after the independence of the Turkic states, Turkey began seeking diplomatic relations with them. Over time political meetings between the Turkic countries increased and led to the establishment of [[International Organization of Turkic Culture|TÜRKSOY]] in 1993 and later the [[Turkic Council]] in 2009.

[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]

Many of the Turkic peoples have their homelands in [[Central Asia]], where the Turkic peoples settled from China. According to historian John Foster, "The Turks emerge from among the [[Huns]] in the middle of [the] fifth century. They were living in [[Liang Dynasty|Liang]] territory when it began to be overrun by the greater principality of [[Northern Wei|Wei]]. Preferring to remain under the rule of their own kind, they moved westward into what is now the province of [[Kansu]]. This was the territory of kindred Huns, who were called the [[Rouran]]. The Turks were a small tribe of only five hundred families, and they became serfs to the Rouran, who used them as iron-workers. It is thought that the original meaning of "Turk" is "helmet", and that they may have taken this name because of the shape of one of the hills near which they worked. As their numbers and power grew, their chief made bold to ask for the hand of a Rouran princess in marriage. The demand was refused, and war followed. In 546, the iron-workers defeated their overlords."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Foster, John|title=The Church of the Tang Dynasty|page=13|year=1939|publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Turkic languages have spread, through migrations and conquests, to other locations including present-day Turkey. While the term "Turk" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.

The Turkic languages constitute a [[language family]] of some 30 languages, spoken across a vast area from [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], to [[Siberia]] and Western China, and through to the Middle East.

Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;&lt;ref name=distribution&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.&lt;/ref&gt; an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.&lt;ref name="LanguagesOfTheWorld"/&gt; More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.

At present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]]; There are also several Turkic national subdivisions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonsoftheconquerors.com/16501.html?*session*id*key*=*session*id*val* Across Central Asia], a New Bond Grows – Iron Curtain's Fall Has
Spawned a Convergence for Descendants of Turkic Nomad Hordes&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] including [[Bashkortostan]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Chuvash Republic|Chuvashia]], [[Khakassia]], [[Tuva]], [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]], the [[Altai Republic]], [[Kabardino-Balkaria]], and [[Karachayevo-Cherkessiya]]. Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).

The [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].

The Turks in Turkey are over 60 million&lt;!-- According to a 2008 report prepared for the [[National Security Council (Turkey) of Turkey by academics of three Turkish universities in eastern Anatolia, there were approximately 50 to 55 million ethnic Turks --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/turkiye-deki-kurtlerin-sayisi--magazin-873452/|title=Türkiye'deki Kürtlerin sayısı!|trans-title=The number of Kurds in Turkey!|language=tr|newspaper=[[Milliyet]]|date=6 June 2008|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 70 million worldwide, while the second largest Turkic people are the [[Azerbaijanis]], numbering 22 to 38 million worldwide; most of them live in Azerbaijan and Iran.

[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning "horde" or "army".

The [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.

There are several international organizations created with the purpose of furthering cooperation between countries with Turkic-speaking populations, such as the [[Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture]] (TÜRKSOY) and the Parliamentary Assembly of Turkic-speaking Countries (TÜRKPA).

The newly established [[Turkic Council]], founded on November 3, 2009 by the ''Nakhchivan Agreement'' confederation, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and Turkey, aims to integrate these organizations into a tighter geopolitical framework.

Additionally, Turkic people are found within [[Crimea]], [[Altishahr]] region of western [[China]], northern [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Russia]], [[Afghanistan]], and the [[Balkans]]: [[Moldova]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], and former [[Yugoslavia]]. A small number of Turkic people also live in [[Vilnius]], the capital of [[Lithuania]]. Small numbers inhabit eastern [[Poland]] and the south-eastern part of [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;Substantial numbers (possibly several millions) of maghrebis of the former Ottoman colonies in North Africa are of Ottoman Turkish descent. [[Finnish Tatars]]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.

Sometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.

Much of the Turkic population of Central Asia has significant Caucasoid and Mongoloid ancestry. The genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins. The Karakalpaks have a somewhat greater bias towards the eastern markers than the Uzbeks.&lt;ref&gt;''The Karakalpak Gene Pool'' (Spencer Wells, 2001); and discussion and conclusions at www.karakalpak.com/genetics.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkic people display a great variety of ethnic types.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/609972/Turkic-people#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Turkic%20people%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia Turkic people, Encyclopædia Britannica, Online Edition, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; They possess physical features ranging from [[Caucasoid]] to [[Northern Mongoloid]]. Mongoloid and Caucasoid facial structure is common among many Turkic groups, such as [[Chuvash people]], [[Tatars]], [[Kazakhs]], [[Uzbeks]], and [[Bashkirs]].

{{Further information|Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)}}

The Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.

The earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, Greek-derived [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.

The Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, М., 1983, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[Göktürk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century.

The Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].&lt;ref name="LanguagesOfTheWorld"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis Books Ltd.|date=March 2002|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethnologue Altaic"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.)|authorlink=Ethnologue|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90009|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Language Family Trees – Altaic|accessdate = 2007-03-18|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg, S., Michalove, P.A., Manaster Ramer, A., Sidwell, P.J.: "Telling general linguists about Altaic", ''Journal of Linguistics'' 35 (1999): 65–98 [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=17033 Online abstract and link to free pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Huns|Hunnic]] and Bulgaric, are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.

The [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.

==Cuisine==
Markets in the steppe region had a limited range of foodstuffs available—mostly [[grain]]s, [[dried fruit]]s, [[spices]], and [[tea]]. Turks mostly herded [[sheep]], [[goat]]s and [[horse]]s. Dairy was a staple of the nomadic diet and there are many Turkic words for various dairy products such as ''süt'' (milk), ''yagh'' (butter), [[ayran]], ''[[kaymak|qaymaq]]'' (similar to [[clotted cream]]), [[Kumis|qi̅mi̅z]] (fermented mare's milk) and ''[[qurut]]'' (dried yoghurt). During the Middle Ages [[Kazakh cuisine|Kazakh]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and [[Tatar cuisine|Tatars]], who were historically part of the Turkic nomadic group known as the [[Golden Horde]], continued to develop new variations of dairy products.&lt;ref name=osfc&gt;{{Cite book| title = Food on the Move| publisher=[[Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery]] |date=1996 |chapter=The Horseback Kitchen of Central Asia |accessdate = 2018-07-16| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Food_on_the_Move.html?id=uYqTiD7SbcQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nomadic Turks cooked their meals in a ''[[Kazan (cookware)|qazan]]'', a pot similar to a [[cauldron]]; a wooden rack called a ''qasqan'' can be used to prepare certain steamed foods, like the traditional meat dumplings called ''[[Manti (food)|manti]]''. They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''bïchaq'') and spoon (''qashi̅q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''süzgu̅çh'', and a grinding stone called ''tāgirmān''.&lt;ref name=osfc /&gt;

Medieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qawïrmach'', while ''köchä'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.&lt;ref name=osfc /&gt;

There are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi̅rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|chälpäk]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[chöräk]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[Börek|böräk]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].&lt;ref name=osfc /&gt;

Herd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter  months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qazı|qazi̅]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''qïyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''söklünch''—from the root ''sök-'' meaning "to tear off", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times. ''[[Kavurma|Qawirma]]'' is a typical fried meat dish, and ''[[kullama]]'' is a soup of noodles and lamb.&lt;ref name=osfc /&gt;

[[Tengri]], a [[sky god]], worshipped by the upper classes of early Turkic society until [[Manichaeism]] was introduced as the official religion of the [[Uyghur Empire]] in 763.
The [[gray wolf|wolf]] symbolizes honour and is also considered the mother of most Turkic peoples. [[Asena]] (Ashina Tuwu) is the wolf mother of [[Tumen Il-Qağan]], the first Khan of the [[Göktürks]]. The [[horse]] and [[bird of prey|predatory birds]], such as the [[eagle]] or [[falcon]], are also main figures of Turkic mythology.

Tengri Bögü Khan made the now extinct [[Manichaeism]] the state religion of [[Uyghur Khaganate]] in 763 and it was also popular in [[Karluks]]. It was gradually replaced by the [[Mahayana Buddhism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} It existed in the Buddhist Uyghur [[Gaochang]] up to the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianhistory.com/data/articles/j02/1686.html|title=关于回鹘摩尼教史的几个问题|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tibetan Buddhism]], or [[Vajrayana]] was the main religion after Manichaeism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xjass.com/mzwh/content/2008-09/08/content_29600.htm|title=元明时期的新疆藏传佛教|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092501/http://www.xjass.com/mzwh/content/2008-09/08/content_29600.htm|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worshipped [[Buddha|Täŋri Täŋrisi Burxan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xjass.com/ls/content/2009-11/15/content_117347.htm|title=回鹘文《陶师本生》及其特点|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506102536/http://www.xjass.com/ls/content/2009-11/15/content_117347.htm|archivedate=6 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guanyin|Quanšï Im Pusar]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tanghistory.net/data/articles/d02/621.html 回鹘观音信仰考]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maitreya|Maitri Burxan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BJ001/93572.htm|title=回鶻彌勒信仰考|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkic [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent]] and west [[Xinjiang]] attributed with a rapid and almost total disappearance of it and other religions in North India and Central Asia. The [[Yugur|Sari Uygurs]] "Yellow Yughurs" of Western China, as well as the [[Tuvans]] and [[Altai people|Altai]] of Russia are the only remaining [[Buddhist]] Turkic peoples.

The [[Krymchaks]] of Eastern Europe (Especially [[Crimea]]) are [[Jewish]], and there are Turks of Jewish backgrounds who live in major cities such as Istanbul, Ankara and Baku. The [[Crimean Karaites|Khazars]] widely practiced Judaism before their conversion to Islam.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Even though many Turkic peoples became [[Islam|Muslims]] under the influence of [[Sufi]]s, often of Shī‘ah persuasion, most Turkic people today are [[Sunni]] Muslims, although a significant number in Turkey are [[Alevi]]s. Alevi Turks, who were once primarily dwelling in eastern Anatolia, are today concentrated in major urban centers in western Turkey with the increased urbanism.

The major Christian-Turkic peoples are the [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]] of [[Chuvash Republic|Chuvashia]] and the [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]] (''Gökoğuz'') of [[Moldova]]. The traditional religion of the [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]] of Russia, while containing many ancient Turkic concepts, also shares some elements with [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Khazar]] Judaism, and Islam.
The Chuvash converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] for the most part in the second half of the 19th century. As a result, festivals and rites were made to coincide with Orthodox feasts, and Christian rites replaced their traditional counterparts. A minority of the Chuvash still profess their traditional faith.&lt;ref&gt;Guide to Russia:[http://russiatoday.strana.ru/en/profile/people/nat/1482.html Chuvash] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050501105730/http://russiatoday.strana.ru/en/profile/people/nat/1482.html |date=2005-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Church of the East]] was popular among Turks such as the [[Naimans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/narratives/discovery/09/index.html.zh|title=景教艺术在西域之发现|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It even revived in Gaochang and expanded in [[Xinjiang]] in the [[Yuan dynasty]] period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hk.plm.org.cn/e_book/xz-16914.pdf 高昌回鹘与环塔里木多元文化的融合] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817230447/http://hk.plm.org.cn/e_book/xz-16914.pdf |date=2011-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zzs.chd.edu.cn/kjqk/xbjzgcxyxb-shkx/xbjz2006/0603pdf/060316.pdf 唐代中围景教与景教本部教会的关系] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130074300/http://zzs.chd.edu.cn/kjqk/xbjzgcxyxb-shkx/xbjz2006/0603pdf/060316.pdf |date=2011-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xjass.com/mzwh/content/2008-06/30/content_14081.htm|title=景教在西域的传播|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101519/http://www.xjass.com/mzwh/content/2008-06/30/content_14081.htm|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It disappeared after its collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stnn.cc/geography/200607/t20060704_270851.html|title=新闻_星岛环球网|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~lewi/WPS/97%20_Duan.pdf 7–11 世紀景教在陸上絲綢之路的傳播]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33862">'''Wrecking''' is the practice of taking valuables from a [[shipwreck]] which has foundered or run aground close to shore. Often an unregulated activity of opportunity in coastal communities, wrecking has been subjected to increasing regulation and evolved into what is now known as [[marine salvage]]. Wrecking is no longer economically significant; however, as recently as the 19th century in some parts of the world, it was the mainstay of otherwise economically marginal coastal communities.

A traditional legend is of wreckers deliberately decoying ships on to coasts using tricks (in particular false lights), so that they run ashore and can be plundered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutchings|first1=Richard J|title=Smugglers of the Isle of Wight|date=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this has been depicted in many stories and legends, it is uncertain that this has ever happened.

=="False lights"==
There are legends that some ships were deliberately lured into danger by a display of false lights. John Viele, retired U. S. Navy officer and author of a history of wrecking in the Florida Keys, states that such tricks simply would not work. He points out that mariners interpret a light as indicating land, and so avoid them if they cannot identify them. Moreover, oil lanterns cannot be seen very far over water at night, unless they are large, fitted with mirrors or lenses, and mounted at a great height (i.e., in a [[lighthouse]]). In hundreds of admiralty court cases heard in [[Key West, Florida]], no captain of a wrecked ship ever charged that he had been led astray by a false light.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 94-5.&lt;/ref&gt; A Bahamian wrecker, when asked if he and his crewmates made beacons on shore or showed their lights to warn ships away from the land at night, is reported to have said, "No, no [laughing]; we always put them out for a better chance by night".&lt;ref&gt;Albury. P. 139.&lt;br&gt;Craton. P. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legend maintains that the town of [[Nags Head, North Carolina]] takes its name from wreckers or "Bankers" deploying false lights. The Nags Head urban legend states that in the 18th century, wreckers would hang lanterns from the necks of [[mule]]s (colloquially called "nags" at the time) and walk the animals very slowly up and down the beach. The alleged intent was to fool mariners into believing that the slow-moving lights were ships drifting at rest or at anchor, prompting the ships to change course and subsequently run aground.  In 1860, a writer for ''Harper’s New Monthly Magazine'' corroborates the story of the "Bankers" who gave Nags Head its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walbert|first1=David|title=Graveyard of the Atlantic|url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-colonial/2704|website=Learn NC|publisher=learnnc.org|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wrecking in the Americas==

===Spanish America===
As soon as the Spanish began sending home the treasures they found in the New World, some of the treasure was lost in shipwrecks. By the 1540s Indians along the coast of Florida, where many of the Spanish treasure ships wrecked, were diving on the wrecks and recovering significant amounts of gold and silver. By that time the Spanish had been using first Indians (the [[Lucayan people|Lucayans]] from [[the Bahamas]] were particularly prized for the task) and then Africans to dive for pearls around the islands near present-day [[Venezuela]]. The Spanish began using these divers to recover treasure from shipwrecks. The Spanish kept salvage ships with crews of African divers on-call in major ports around the Caribbean, ready to sail as soon as word of a wreck was received. In the course of the 16th through the 18th centuries the Spanish recovered more than 100,000,000 [[peso]]s worth of treasure by such means. Spanish salvage efforts had varying success. Although the Spanish carried out salvage operations on the wrecks of the [[1715 Treasure Fleet]] for four years, they recovered less than half of the treasure recorded as sent on the fleet. On the other hand, the Spanish recovered more treasure from the [[List of the 1733 Spanish Plate Fleet Shipwrecks|1733 treasure fleet]] than had been officially registered on it.&lt;ref&gt;Marx. Pp. 55-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bermuda and Jamaica===
In the 16th and 17th centuries Spanish ships returning to Spain from the Caribbean rode the [[Gulf Stream]] to [[Cape Canaveral]] and then aimed for [[Bermuda]]. Raising Bermuda was essential to Spanish ships for verifying their position before setting course for the [[Azores]]. As a result, some Spanish ships wrecked on Bermuda. After the English settled on Bermuda in the early 17th century, they quickly took up "wracking" on Bermuda, and then extended their search for wrecks to all of the Caribbean. Later in the 17th century the center for English "wracking" in the Caribbean shifted to [[Port Royal]] in [[Jamaica]]. [[William Phips]] went there to recruit the divers he used to salvage treasure from a Spanish wreck on the north shore of [[Hispaniola]], where he recovered the largest amount of treasure from a single wreck before the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Marx. P. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===The Bahamas===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Bahamas]]. --&gt;
Wrecking (or "wracking") was an important activity in the Bahamas from its first settlement in 1648. A company of religious dissidents from [[Bermuda]], the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]], established a colony on [[Eleuthera|Eleutheria]]. Their governing document, the ''Articles and Orders'', included regulations of wrecking, providing that any salvaged [[weapon|ordnance]] would be held in common for the defense of the colony, and all other salvaged goods would be delivered to designated agents, "made fit for sale" and then sold, with one-third of the proceeds going to the wreckers.&lt;ref&gt;Albury. Pp 131-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Eleutheran Adventurers were primarily farmers, seamen from Bermuda began settling on [[New Providence]] in the 1660s, attracted by [[ambergris]], [[Shipwreck|wrecks]] and salt. There were vessels dedicated to wrecking from this time, but wrecking was a secondary occupation for most men. These seamen, who called themselves "wrackers" or "wreckers", pursued wrecking aggressively, regarding all salvage as their property. They were rumored to have killed people who had inconveniently survived a shipwreck. They drove [[Spain|Spanish]] salvors away from Spanish wrecks, and even took goods that the Spanish had already salvaged. Spain regarded the Bahamian wreckers as [[pirate]]s, and retaliated by attacking the wreckers' ships, kidnapping farmers from New Providence, and burning the capital, [[Nassau, Bahamas#History|Charles Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Albury. Pp. 48, 51-2, 131, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahamian government eventually exerted control over the wreckers. The wreckers were required to carry salvaged goods to Nassau, where they were auctioned. However, goods useful on a ship or in a wrecker's home were often diverted with a blind eye turned by government officials. Increased shipping after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 led to more wrecks. Vessels specifically designed for wrecking were built in the Bahamas. A [[United States|U.S]] law of 1825 required that all goods salvaged from wrecks in U.S. waters be taken to an American [[port of entry]] (which, for the Bahamians, meant [[Key West, Florida]]). Many Bahamian wreckers eventually moved to Key West and became U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Albury. Pp. 134-5, 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wrecking was a mainstay of the Bahamian economy through most of the 19th century. In 1856 there were 302 ships and 2,679 men (out of a total population of 27,000) licensed as wreckers in the Bahamas. In that year salvaged wreck cargo brought to Nassau was valued at £96,304, more than half of all imports to the Bahamas. More than two-thirds of exports from the Bahamas were salvaged goods. The government normally took 15% customs duty on salvaged goods. If the salvaged cargo was not claimed, the Vice Admiralty Court took 30%, and the Governor took another 10%. Shore workers (warehouse workers, agents and laborers) usually received around 14% of the value. The wreckers themselves usually received 40% to 60% of the value of the salvaged goods. Even so, the average annual income of an ordinary seaman on a wrecker was about ₤20.&lt;ref&gt;Albury. Pp. 135, 137.&lt;br /&gt;Craton. P. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil War]] sharply cut the volume of shipping around the Bahamas, and the wreckers suffered with far fewer wrecks to salvage. The end of the Civil War brought back increased shipping and wrecks. In 1865, the last year of the Civil War, £28,000 worth of salvaged goods were taken to Nassau. In 1866 that rose to £108,000, and peaked at £154,000 in 1870. Wrecking then entered a decline, and was nearly gone by the end of the 19th century. More lighthouses (eventually numbering 37 in the Bahamas), better charts, more ships powered by steam, better qualified ship's officers, and more seaworthy ships all contributed to fewer wrecks.&lt;ref&gt;Albury. Pp. 143, 157.&lt;br /&gt;Craton. Pp. 226-7, 246-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Florida Keys===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Florida Keys]] and [[Key West, Florida]]. --&gt;
For several centuries wrecking was an important economic activity in the [[Florida Keys]]. During the 19th century wrecking in the Keys became a highly organized and regulated industry, with dozens of vessels and hundreds of men active in the trade at any given time. The Florida Keys form a long arc of islands extending from the southern end of the east coast of [[Florida]] to the [[Dry Tortugas]]. A line of shallow coral reefs, the [[Florida Reef]], runs parallel to the Keys from east of [[Key Biscayne|Cape Florida]] to southwest of Key West, with dangerous shoals stretching west from Key West to the Dry Tortugas. This chain of reefs and shoals is approximately {{convert|200|mi|km}} long, separated from the Keys by the narrow and relatively shallow Hawk Channel. The [[Gulf Stream]] passes close to the Florida Reef through the [[Straits of Florida]], which is the major route for shipping between the eastern coast of the [[United States]] and ports in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the western [[Caribbean Sea]]. The combination of heavy shipping and a powerful current flowing close to dangerous reefs made the Florida Keys the site of a great many wrecks, especially during the 19th century. Ships were wrecking on the Florida Reef at the rate of almost once a week in the middle of the 19th century (the collector of customs in Key West reported a rate of 48 wrecks a year in 1848). For a period of almost 100 years, wrecking captains and wrecking vessels in the Keys had to hold a license issued by the [[United States district court|Federal court]]. In 1858 there were 47 boats and ships licensed as wreckers.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 54-5, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early history====
Ships began wrecking along the Florida Reef almost as soon as Europeans reached the [[New World]]. From early in the 16th century, Spanish ships returning from the New World to Spain sailed from [[Havana]] to catch the Gulf Stream, which meant they passed close to the Florida Reef, with some wrecking. The first wreckers in the Keys were Indians; when [[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]]'s ship was wrecked in 1549, he was taken prisoner by Indians who were experienced in plundering wrecked ships. In 1622, six ships of the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] wrecked during a [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]] in the lower Keys. Spanish operations to recover the gold and silver from the lost ships continued intermittently for 21 years, but the Spanish lost track of the ''[[Nuestra Señora de Atocha]]'', which was finally found and excavated in the 20th century. In 1733, 19 ships of the Spanish treasure fleet wrecked during a hurricane in the middle and upper keys, and salvage operations lasted four years. The Spanish used dragged chains, [[grapnel]]s, [[Free-diving|free divers]] and even an early [[diving bell]] to find and recover goods from the wrecked ships.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 3-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 18th century ships from [[The Bahamas]] began frequenting the Florida Keys. The Bahamians were opportunists, [[fishing]], [[Turtling (hunting)|turtling]], [[logging]] tropical [[hardwood]]s on the Keys, and salvaging wrecks as the opportunity arose. When the Spanish were salvaging the wrecks of the 1733 treasure fleet, the Spanish commander of the operation expressed concern that the Bahamians would try to salvage some of the treasure on their own. By 1775, George Gauld, who produced a chart of the Keys that was still being used 75 years later, advised mariners to stay with their ships if they wrecked, so that the Bahamian wreckers could assist them. Although the Keys were at various times part of [[Spanish Florida]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] colony of [[East Florida]] and the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Florida Territory]], the Bahamians took goods salvaged from ships wrecked in the Keys to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] for adjudication, rather than to the Florida [[port of entry]], [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. After the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[War of 1812]] in 1815, increased shipping through the Straights of Florida resulted in an increase in wrecks on the Keys, and [[the Crown]]'s share from the auction of salvaged goods became the major support of the economy of Nassau.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 14-25, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Under United States jurisdiction====
After 1815, fishing boats from [[New England]] began visiting the Florida Keys in the winter to fish for the Havana market. These fishermen engaged in wrecking when the opportunity arose. With the acquisition of Florida by the United States in 1821 and the settlement of Key West in 1822, the New England fishermen-wreckers began moving their homes to Key West. Conflicts quickly developed with the Bahamian wreckers. [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] ships stopped and boarded Bahamian wreckers to check papers, and arrested two Bahamian captains on suspicion of smuggling slaves. American wreckers became increasingly hostile to Bahamian wreckers, and in 1825 the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed a law requiring all goods salvaged in U.S. waters to be taken to an American port of entry. This measure created a great inconvenience for the Bahamian wreckers, as they had to take salvaged goods and ships to Key West before they could return home to the Bahamas. Some of them soon moved to Key West and acquired U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 25-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Key West had become a port of entry in 1822. In the same year the U.S. Navy chose Key West as its base for suppressing [[piracy]] in the [[West Indies]]. The city quickly developed into Florida's most important port. By the 1830s Key West accounted for 60% to 90% of imports and exports for the Territory. Most of this traffic was due to the activities of the wreckers. [[Warehouse]]s for storing salvaged goods, [[shipyard]]s for repairing damaged ships that had been removed from the reefs and for building vessels to be used in wrecking, and [[ship chandler]]s for refitting ships all contributed to the city's prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 33-7, 64-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1820s and 1830s [[Indian Key, Florida|Indian Key]] functioned as a secondary center for the wrecking industry in the Keys. Closer to most of the reefs off the keys than Key West, Indian Key enjoyed a brief prosperity before being destroyed in a [[Second Seminole War#Indian Key|raid]] by [[Seminoles]] in 1840.

====Wrecking operations====
Wrecking in the Florida Keys was conducted from sailing vessels. Numerous vessels would patrol along the Florida Reef looking for wrecks. The wreckers would normally anchor at night in protected anchorages along the Keys, and then sail out in the morning to see if any ships had wrecked during the night. As a result, a ship that ran on the reef during the night might attract a dozen wreckers by the afternoon of the next day. The first wrecking captain to reach a stranded ship became the wreck master, determining how many wreckers he needed to help salvage the ship, and directing the operation. Wreckers had an obligation to save passengers and crew of the wrecked ship (for which they received no compensation), and to salvage as much of the cargo as possible, and the ship, as well. If the judge in Federal court decided that a wrecking crew had not done everything possible to salvage cargo and ship, he would reduce the award.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 95-7, 133-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The salvaged cargo and the ship, if it could be saved, were taken to Key West where they were appraised or auctioned. The wrecking vessels and crews that participated in the operations would then be awarded a share of the salvage value. Half of the salvage award went to the owners of the wrecking vessels, divided among the boats on a tonnage basis. The other half went to the wrecker crews, proportional to the number of crewmen on each vessel. Ordinary crewmen received one share, "boys" a half-share, cooks, one-and-a-quarter shares, and captains one to three shares, depending on the size of the vessel. Divers, who dove into the flooded holds of ships to retrieve cargo, received extra shares. By the time a salvage award was divided this way, individual shares were often quite small. Contemporary observers estimated that wrecking crews on average made no more than an ordinary seaman.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 73, 76-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first few years after Florida was acquired by the United States, salvage awards were determined either by prior agreement between the wreck master and the captain of the wrecked ship, or by arbitration. As the persons available to serve as arbitrators usually had ties to the wrecking industry, if not a direct business relationship with the wreck master and/or the owners of the wrecking vessels, the process was often abused, with awards as high as 90% of the salvaged value. In 1829 a United States District Court was established in Key West with admiralty jurisdiction, after which most salvage cases were decided in court. Court awards for a wrecking operation averaged about 25% of the salvage value. Private agreements and arbitration remained an option, however, particularly when the judge was not available.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 43-48.&lt;/ref&gt; A visitor to Key West in the 1880s reported that the United States District Court was in session almost every week, and had heard more than 700 [[Admiralty law]] cases during the preceding year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sunshine|first=Sylvia|title=Petals Plucked from Sunny Climes|year=1886|publisher=Southern Methodist Publishing House|location=Nashville, Tennessee|pages=319|url=https://archive.org/details/petalspluckedfro00brooiala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wreckers were required by the Federal law to carry equipment that might be needed to save cargo and ships. Such equipment included heavy anchors for kedging (hauling) ships off reefs, heavy [[hawser]]s and chain, [[fender (boating)|fenders]] and [[Block and tackle|blocks and tackle]]. Wreckers also had to be prepared to make emergency repairs to ships to refloat them or keep them afloat while they were sailed or towed back to Key West. By the middle of the 19th century [[windmill]]-powered pumps, and later a steam-powered pump, were kept in Key West. If the wreckers were not able to pump out a ship fast enough to float it using the ship's own pumps, they could rent one of the large pumps from Key West. As the wrecking vessels could not always directly approach wrecked ships, they had to carry sturdy boats.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 46, 61-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cargoes saved by wreckers varied tremendously. Cotton was perhaps the most valuable bulk cargo. A bale of cotton might be worth [[United States dollar|US$]]50 or $60 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], but a bale pulled from a flooded hold would be saturated with water, and weigh as much as half a [[ton]]. Unusual cargoes salvaged by wreckers included the fossilized [[Basilosaurus#Fossil finds|"Hydrarchos"]] skeleton collected in [[Alabama]] by Albert Koch, and a [[locomotive]]. In 1827 [[Guerrero (ship)|''Guerrero'']], a Spanish slave-runner carrying 500 African captives, and the [[Royal Navy]] warship [[HMS Nimble (1826)|HMS ''Nimble'']] ran onto the Florida Reef during a running gun battle. Wreckers went to the aid of both ships. After most of the Africans and the Spanish crewmen had been transferred to wrecker vessels, the Spanish crewmen commandeered two of the ships and sailed to Cuba with most of the Africans. The remaining 120 Africans were taken to Key West, and then to St. Augustine. After Congress passed a special law the next year, 96 surviving Africans were sent to [[Liberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 122-31, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decline====
In an effort to reduce the number of wrecks along the Florida Reef, the United States government funded the construction of lighthouses. Lighthouses were built in the 1820s at [[Cape Florida Light|Cape Florida]], Key West (both on the [[Key West Light|island]] itself and on nearby [[Sand Key Light|Sand Key]], and on [[Garden Key Light|Garden Key]] in the Dry Tortugas. A lightship was stationed at [[Carysfort Reef Light|Carysfort Reef]]. Mariners complained that the lights were not visible enough. There were also long interruptions. The Cape Florida lighthouse was burned by Seminoles in 1836 and remained dark for ten years. It was also dark while the tower was made higher in 1855. It was put out of commission again in 1860 by [[Confederate States of American|Confederate]] sympathizers and remained dark until the end of the [[American Civil War]] in 1865. The Key West and Sand Key lighthouses were destroyed by a hurricane in 1846. A lightship was placed at Sand Key until the lighthouses could be rebuilt. Beginning in 1852 lighthouses were built directly on the Florida Reef, but it was 1880 before mariners could rely on having a lighthouse in sight at all times while sailing along the Florida Reef.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 154-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wreckers were unhappy about the lights, expecting them to reduce the number of wrecks and their livelihood. Initially, however, the lights did not greatly reduce the number of wrecks. Some ships wrecked when their captains became confused about which lights they were seeing, mistaking lights on the Florida Reef for lights on the [[Bahama Banks]]. Some wrecks may have been deliberate, as well. On a few occasions wreckers trying to refloat flooded ships discovered that holes had been bored through the hull below the water line. The captain of a ship that had wrecked stated that the wreck was not to be greatly regretted, as there were too many ships in the freight business. Judge Marvin of the Federal court in Key West told a navy officer in 1860 there was "a great deal of wrecking by design."&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 140, 154-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipping through the Straits of Florida, and therefore the number of wrecks on the Florida Reef, declined sharply during the Civil War. Following the Civil War, the number of wrecks did not increase as fast as the ship traffic through the Straits. More lighthouses were in place, better charts were available, and more ships were powered by steam and thus less vulnerable to being pushed onto reefs by unfavorable winds. Steam-powered vessels began to enter the wrecking trade. Eventually ocean-going [[tugboat]]s took over what became known as [[marine salvage]] operations. By the end of the 19th century wrecks were infrequent. The last major wrecking operation was in 1905, when 77 small vessels and 500 men salvaged cargo from the steamer ''Alicia''. Salvage work was abandoned when divers refused to continue, as contaminated water in the hold was causing them to become blind for 24 hours after a dive. The salvage award was US$17,690. The last local wrecker was bought out by a New York company in 1920. The Federal court closed the book of wrecking licenses the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Viele. Pp. 169-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British North America and Canada===
Residents of the isolated communities along the outer banks of North Carolina and the Islands of [[Hatteras Island|Hatteras]], [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke]], and [[Portsmouth, North Carolina|Portsmouth]] and in Newfoundland and the islands and coastline of the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and engaged in wrecking for many years. In [[Nova Scotia]], [[Seal Island, Nova Scotia|Seal Island]] and especially [[Sable Island]] were known for wrecking. Reports of violent wreckers on Sable helped spur efforts by the colony of Nova Scotia to establish a rescue station in Sable Island in 1801.

== Wrecking in Europe ==

=== Britain ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
Wrecking was well known in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] where the rocky coastline, and strong prevailing onshore winds helped wreck many merchant ships and warships. It is rumoured that ships were sometimes deliberately attracted: false lights on the shore were said to be used sometimes to lead ships into disaster. However, there is no evidence to support these ideas.

In 1735 a law was passed to make it an offence to make false lights, but no one was prosecuted as a result. In 1769 William Pearse was hanged at [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]] in Cornwall for stealing from a wreck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/cornwall.html Death sentences - Cornwall 1735-1799]&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until after a case in the Court of Appeal in 1870 that rewards were made for rescuing people.

Wrecking was a major industry in the 19th century, and as far back as the 16th century, especially of ships returning from the New World using the [[Gulf Stream]], which passes by the south west of England. This would help to speed these ships on their way to France and Spain and put them out of position. Wreckers would attempt to frighten off the curious, suspicious or unwanted visitors, by spreading wild rumours concerning supernatural activity, ghosts and cannibals (as occurred in [[Clovelly]]) near their wrecking sites.

Wrecking was a major activity of the inhabitants of [[Stroma Island]] in the [[Pentland Firth]] off the north of [[Scotland]]. It was also well known on the [[Goodwin Sands]] off the south east of England where over 2000 wrecks have occurred. The boatmen of [[Deal, Kent|Deal]], who took supplies to ships at anchor off the coast, would plunder any wrecked vessel. Another area where wrecking was prevalent was the Wirral Peninsula, near Liverpool, where wrecking continued to be reported into the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wirralhistory.net/smugglers.html ''Wirral Smugglers, Wreckers and Pirates'' by Gavin Chappell&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 BBC documentary, [[Coast (TV series)|''Coast'']], successfully replicated the conditions of false light wrecking in an experiment which suggested that a single-candle lantern onshore would be sufficient to lure a boat into dangerous water on a dark night. It should be noted that the boat crew did not see the light until they got within 150m of it.&lt;ref&gt;''Coast'' Series 1 episode 2, BBC 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the container ship [[MSC Napoli|MSC ''Napoli'']] went aground off [[Branscombe]] beach in [[Devon]]. Some of its cargo was washed ashore and many wreckers plundered the cargo in spite of attempts to prevent this. People came long distances to retrieve such things as BMW motorcycles. Goods from wrecks are supposed by law to be reported to the "[[Receiver of Wreck]]" and finders will then be given a reward.

=== Denmark ===
Wrecking has been practised a long way back in Denmark. The long shorelines, the heavy international marine traffic in combination with some difficult and often harsh waters, has produced many wrecks here. It was only recently, that the light signalling was fully developed and deep sea-bed canals were dug in the often very shallow waters here, making seafaring relatively safe. [[Skagen's Vippefyr]] was constructed in 1627, along with several other rudimentary lighting signals in the following years, after complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfs.dk/da/soeg-i-soefartshistorien/digitale-udstillinger/navigation-og-verdensbilleder/hjaelpen-fra-kysten/skagens-vippefyr|title=Skagens vippefyr|language=Danish|publisher=Maritime Museum of Denmark|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea floor canals came centuries later. It was and still is common practice to hire skilled Danish pilots to help navigate in and out of the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfs.dk/da/soeg-i-soefartshistorien/digitale-udstillinger/navigation-og-verdensbilleder/hjaelpen-fra-kysten/ove-alexis-winsloev|title=Ove Alexis Winsløv|language=Danish|publisher=Maritime Museum of Denmark|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So-called wreck masters used to be employed in the Danish coastal communities, in order to oversee, report on and collect valuables from new wrecks. A former wreck masters home can be experienced at the Wreck Master's Farm near [[Rubjerg Knude]] on the North Atlantic coast for example. The last wreck master here left in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rubjergknude.dk/index.php?id=175|title=The Wreck Master's Farm|publisher=Vendsyssel Historical Museum|website=Rubjerg Knude's cultural and natural history|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few wreck masters are still appointed in Denmark, but nowadays the job also includes observations and reporting on oil spills, pollutions, vandalism, etc., and they work in close cooperation with the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strandfoged.dk/om-strandfogeden|title=Strandfoged |language=Danish|website=Standfogeden.dk|accessdate=28 September 2014}} Official website for wreck masters in Denmark&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional accounts==
Wreckers have been featured in a number of works of fiction, including a references in ''[[The Shipping News]]'' by [[E. Annie Proulx]], ''[[Jamaica Inn (novel)|Jamaica Inn]]'' by [[Daphne du Maurier]], ''Shipwrecks'' by  [[Akira Yoshimura]], the film ''[[The Light at the Edge of the World]]'' based on the novel ''[[The Lighthouse at the End of the World|Le Phare du bout du monde]]'' by [[Jules Verne]], and also in the opening chapter of Verne's ''[[The Archipelago on Fire]]''.

The plot of [[Compton Mackenzie]]'s novel [[Whisky Galore (novel)|''Whisky Galore'']] revolves around the inhabitants of a small Scottish island recovering as-yet-untaxed whisky from a shipwreck and their subsequent efforts at evading government officials.

Dame [[Ethel Smyth]]'s opera, [[The Wreckers (opera)|''The Wreckers'']], is set in Cornwall—the plot revolves around deliberate wrecking.

In 1942, the [[Technicolor]] Movie ''[[Reap The Wild Wind]] '' by [[Cecil B. DeMille]] depicted life in the wrecking business in the Nineteenth Century around [[Key West, Florida]]. It garnered an [[Academy Award]] for underwater [[Special Effects]].&lt;ref&gt;IMDb.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'' TV series aired a two-episode live action adventure film entitled ''The Mooncussers'' about the investigation and exposure of a gang of wreckers.

[[Enid Blyton]], specifically in the ''[[The Famous Five (novel series)|Famous Five]]'' books, writes often about the treasures of the wreckers.

''[[The Wreckers]]'', by Iain Lawrence, is a book for younger readers about ''The Isle of Skye'' (a London vessel) being shipwrecked along the shores of Pendennis, Cornwall.

Canadian [[progressive rock]] band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] included a song on their 2012 album ''[[Clockwork Angels]]'' titled "The Wreckers", the lyrics of which were inspired by historical tales of wreckers luring ships to their demise.

''[[Crimson Shore]]'' is part of the Agent Pendergast series by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child.  The main story involves a ship, the ''Pembroke Castle'', being purposefully wrecked on the rocks off the coast of Massachusetts. 

''[[Coot Club]]'', the fifth of [[Arthur Ransome]]'s [[Swallows and Amazons series|Swallows and Amazons]] series of books, features wreckers on the [[The Broads|Norfolk Broads]].

''[[The Wreck of the Zanzibar]]'' is a [[Whitbread Award]]-winning children's novel by [[Michael Morpurgo]], set on the [[Isles of Scilly]].

''[[H.M.S. Dolores]]'' is a 2016 board game whose plot centers around rival crews of wreckers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asmodee.us/en/games/hms-dolores/|title=HMS Dolores|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also played in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) for the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], [[New Jersey Nets]], [[Washington Wizards]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]].

Yi joined the Guangdong Southern Tigers for the [[2002–03 CBA season]], and subsequently won the CBA Rookie of the Year award. In his first five years with Guangdong, the team won three CBA titles. In the [[2007 NBA draft]], he was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the sixth overall pick. Initially, Yi declined to sign with Milwaukee for several months before agreeing to a contract with them on 29 August 2007. He later played for three other NBA teams until returning to the Guangdong Southern Tigers in 2012.

Yi also plays for the [[China men's national basketball team|Chinese national team]], having represented his country at the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2004]], [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008]], [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2012]] and [[Basketball at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2016]], as well as the [[2006 FIBA World Championship|2006]] and [[2010 FIBA World Championship]]s.

As a child, Yi's parents did not allow him to join a sports school, which is designed for children predicted to be future professional athletes.&lt;ref name="wanttoplay" /&gt; However, a sports school's basketball coach who noticed Yi's potential in playing street basketball persuaded Yi's family to allow him to train professionally.&lt;ref name="wanttoplay"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/2003/Sep/75681.htm |title=Little Giant Yi Jianlian: I Want to Play NBA Basketball |last=Li |first=Xiao |date=September 22, 2003 |publisher=China.org.cn |accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to sign Yi to an endorsement deal, [[Adidas]] invited him to attend the company's ABCD camp in New Jersey in 2002, where he competed against all-American high school players.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nbabio"&gt;{{cite web |title=NBA.com : Yi Jianlian Bio Page |publisher=NBA.com |url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/yi_jianlian/bio.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105060300/http://www.nba.com/playerfile/yi_jianlian/bio.html |archivedate=2012-11-05 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to China later that year, he signed a professional contract with [[Chinese Basketball Association]] side [[Guangdong Southern Tigers]] and averaged 3.5 points and 1.9 rebounds per game in his first season. He also averaged 7.3 points and 7.3 rebounds per game in four games during the playoffs, and won the Rookie of the Year award. Yi was featured in ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''{{'}}s August 2003 article titled "The Next [[Yao Ming]]".&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Brook |last=Larmer |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101030908/xyi.html |title=What's Next? |date=August 24, 2003 |accessdate=2007-05-02 | work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each of his next three seasons, Yi led Guangdong to the CBA championship and he was awarded [[CBA Finals MVP|the CBA finals' most valuable player]] honor in 2006.&lt;ref name="nbabio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite web |title=2006 FIBA World Championships |url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/06_wcm/teamPlay/play/p/competitioncode//eventid/3507/langlc/en/playernumber/44281/roundid/3507/season/0/teamnumber/262/fe_teamPlay_playProf.html |accessdate=2007-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Yi's final season in the Chinese Basketball Association before he entered the [[2007 NBA draft]], he averaged a career-high 24.9 points and 11.5 rebounds per game, but his team lost to the [[Bayi Rockets]] in the playoff finals.&lt;ref name="nbabio" /&gt;

During the [[2011 NBA lockout]], Yi signed a one-year contract to return to the Guangdong Southern Tigers. Unlike most NBA players who went to the Chinese Basketball Association during that time, he received an option to return to the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] once the lockout had been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/2011-10/08/content_13852028.htm|title=NBA star Yi Jianlian back to China-Stars-chinadaily.com.cn|publisher=|accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=aw-wojnarowski_china_nba_players_112811 |title=China could block NBA players return |first=Adrian |last=Wojnarowski |work=Yahoo!

In October 2016, Yi returned to Guangdong after spending training camp with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Huberto|last=Meersmans|url=http://nbadestiny.com/yi-jianlian-regresa-china-tras-pedir-los-lakers-le-cortaran/|title=YI JIANLIAN REGRESA A CHINA TRAS PEDIR A LOS LAKERS QUE LE CORTARAN|work=NBADestiny.com|date=October 30, 2016|accessdate=November 5, 2016|language=Spanish}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== NBA career ==
=== NBA draft ===
Yi was not expected to enter the [[NBA draft]] until 2009 because the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] ruled that players are not allowed to leave for foreign leagues until they turned 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Zhau |last=Rui |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/2006-11/03/content_723586.htm |title=Yi can enter 2007 NBA draft |date=November 3, 2006 |accessdate=2007-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2006, however, Yi announced that he would enter the [[2006 NBA draft]] although he eventually decided to withdraw, saying he was "not good enough to compete in the NBA and needed more experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-04/20/content_4451142.htm |title=China's Yi Jianlian not ready for NBA yet |date=April 20, 2006 |accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the [[Guangdong Southern Tigers]] announced that Yi would enter the [[2007 NBA draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2648042 |title=Chinese prospect Yi gets permission to enter '07 draft |date=November 3, 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yi chose [[Dan Fegan]] as his agent to represent him in the NBA draft and flew to Los Angeles to participate in pre-NBA draft camps.&lt;ref name="Feganrepresent"&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Sheridan|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2654250 |title=Fegan will represent Yi for contract, marketing |date=November 8, 2006 |accessdate=2007-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the draft, Yi was predicted by many to be picked anywhere from third to twelfth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/features/draft2007_consensus.html |title=NBA Draft 2007: What's the Consensus? |publisher=NBA.com |date=June 9, 2007 |accessdate=2008-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 June 2007, Yi was selected by the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] with the sixth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft, despite Fegan warning the Milwaukee Bucks not to pick Yi and not allowing them to be one of the teams invited to Yi's pre-draft private workouts in Los Angeles. Fegan did not want Milwaukee to select Yi because the city of Milwaukee did not have a large Asian-American community.&lt;ref name="signing"&gt;{{cite news | last = Gardner | first = Charles F. | title = Yi finally signs with the Bucks | publisher = [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] Online | date = August 29, 2007 | url = http://www.jsonline.com/sports/bucks/29465909.html | accessdate = 2008-04-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606003307/http://www.jsonline.com/sports/bucks/29465909.html | archivedate = June 6, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Milwaukee's general manager [[Larry Harris (basketball)|Larry Harris]] said they had only drafted the best player available to them.&lt;ref name="signing" /&gt; Yi and [[Sun Yue (basketball)|Sun Yue]] together marked the first time in NBA draft history where two Chinese born players were selected in the same draft, which was a feat that would not be repeated again until [[2016 NBA draft|2016]].

After the draft, Milwaukee attempted to convince Yi to sign with the team and on 2 July 2007, the owner of the Bucks franchise, [[Herb Kohl]], wrote a letter to Yi and his representatives, hoping to persuade Yi to sign with the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Marcus | first = David | title = Senator Asks Chinese Star to Consider Bucks | publisher = todaystmj4.com | date = July 1, 2007 | url = http://www.todaystmj4.com/sports/local/8265907.html | accessdate = 2008-04-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009103637/http://www.todaystmj4.com/sports/local/8265907.html | archivedate = October 9, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, head coach [[Larry Krystkowiak]] and Harris met with Yi, attempting to influence him to play for Milwaukee,&lt;ref name="Bucks espn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2928521 |title=Bucks meet with Yi in Las Vegas, begin lobbying |date=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Yi's representatives requested that the team trade Yi to another team with a city that had a large Chinese presence. Chinese officials also required that any team Yi played for would have to give him sufficient playing time for him to improve for the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="signing" /&gt; Kohl made a special trip to Hong Kong to appeal to Yi personally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Milwaukee brass signs Yi Jianlian on Hong Kong trip |work=[[USA Today]] | date = August 29, 2007 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/bucks/2007-08-29-yi-signing_N.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he assured Chinese officials that Yi would have sufficient playing time. On 29 August 2007, the Milwaukee Bucks and Yi agreed to a standard, multi-year rookie contract.&lt;ref name="signing" /&gt;

=== Milwaukee Bucks ===

On 9 November 2007, Yi played against Yao for the first time when the [[Houston Rockets]] hosted Milwaukee in a 104–88 loss.

On 26 June 2008, Yi was traded by the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] along with [[Bobby Simmons]] to the [[New Jersey Nets]] in exchange for [[Richard Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nets acquire Yi Jianlian and Bobby Simmons from Milwaukee in exchange for Richard Jefferson |publisher=NBA.com |url=http://www.nba.com/nets/news/Yi_Trade-276058-64.html |accessdate=2008-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey's team president [[Rod Thorn]] said that "we feel strongly he's going to be a real good player,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/draft2008/news/story?id=3462210 |title=Nets send top scorer Jefferson to Bucks for Yi, Simmons |date=June 27, 2008 |publisher=ESPN.com |accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the team's chief executive Brett Yormark said "it opens up a truly new fan base for us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/28/sports/basketball/28nets.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/B/Basketball |title=By Adding Yi, Nets Hope to Expand Their Market |last=Robinson |first=Joshua |date=June 28, 2008 |work=New York Times |accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yi stated that he didn't expect to be traded, but that it was "an honor to join the Nets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/sports/headlines/basketball/n214424294.shtml |title=Yi, Simmons traded for Richard Jefferson |publisher=beijing2008.cn |accessdate=2009-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902042813/http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/sports/headlines/basketball/n214424294.shtml |archivedate=September 2, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his first 37 games with New Jersey, Yi averaged 10.5 points and 6.2 rebounds per game while shooting 39% from behind the three-point line, which was well above his average from the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/yi_jianlian/career_stats.html |title=Yi Jianlian Career Stats Page |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=2009-02-08 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ac7E55tN?url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/yi_jianlian/career_stats.html |archive-date=September 12, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; But on 9 January 2009, Yi broke the little finger on his right hand and was expected to miss four to six weeks.&lt;ref name="fingerinjury"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/nets/2009/01/10/2009-01-10_yi_jianlian__nets_find_that_pinkie_injur.html |title=Yi Jianlian &amp; Nets find that pinkie injury is bad break |last=Garcia |first=Julian |date=January 11, 2009 |work=[[Daily News (New York)]] |accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thorn called it "lousy timing" because "he'd been playing well," but Yi said "(I'll) just take my time.

Yi made his return from injury after the 2009 NBA All-Star Game in a loss to the [[Houston Rockets]] on 17 February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/games/20090217/NJNHOU/recap.html |title=Battier, Yao lead Rockets past Nets 114-88 |last=Duncan |first=Chris |date=February 17, 2009 |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after averaging only six points on 36% shooting after his return, Yi was removed from the team's starting lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.nypost.com/sports/nets/archives/2009/03/yi_out_anderson.html |title=Yi Out, Anderson In, Devin Gametime |last=Kerber |first=Fred |date=March 27, 2009 |work=New York Post |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411100641/http://blogs.nypost.com/sports/nets/archives/2009/03/yi_out_anderson.html |archivedate=April 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His final averages for the season were 8.6 points and 5.3 rebounds per game, as well as a 38% shooting percentage from the field and 34% on three-point field goals.&lt;ref name="nbastats" /&gt; After New Jersey finished the season outside of the playoffs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/standings?season=2009|title=NBA Standings – 2008–2009 |publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yi's agent [[Dan Fegan]] suggested New Jersey played better when Yi played more minutes and took more shots, and said it "begs the question[sic]...who's accountable?" New Jersey's head coach [[Lawrence Frank]] said that "you have to be patient. He's only 21", and Yi assessed his season by saying he was "still too much up and down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/nets/index.ssf/2009/04/agent_suggests_new_jersey_nets.html|title=Agent suggests New Jersey Nets are to blame for Yi Jianlian's stalled development|last=D'Allesandro|first=Dave|date=April 12, 2009|publisher=New Jersey Star-Ledger|accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2009–10 NBA season|2009–10 season]], Yi returned to the starting lineup for New Jersey.

=== Dallas Mavericks ===
On 6 January 2012, Yi signed with the [[Dallas Mavericks]] to a one-year contract after starting the season with the [[Guangdong Southern Tigers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/dallas/nba/story/_/id/7432700/dallas-mavericks-sign-forward-yi-jianlian-one-year-contract|title=Mavericks sign forward Yi Jianlian|date=January 6, 2012|work=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was immediately assigned to Dallas' [[NBA Development League|D-League]] affiliate team, the [[Texas Legends]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/dleague/news/dallas_mavericks_assign_yi_jia_2012_01_06.html|title=Dallas Mavericks Assign Yi Jianlian to Texas Legends|date=January 6, 2012|work=NBA|access-date=January 7, 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ac7Fpkgt?url=http://www.nba.com/dleague/news/dallas_mavericks_assign_yi_jia_2012_01_06.html|archive-date=September 12, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yi benefited from the new collective bargaining agreement rules which allowed players with more than two years of NBA experience to be assigned to the D-League with the players' consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/dleague/news/nba_cba_boosts_nba_dleague_2011_12_08.html|title=NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement Seen Giving Boost To NBA Development League|date=December 8, 2011|work=NBA}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 January 2012, after playing two games for the Texas Legends, averaging 23 points and 12 rebounds per game, he was recalled by Dallas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2012/news/01/09/mavs-yi-jianlian.ap/index.html|title=Mavs recall Yi Jianlian from D-League affiliate|date=January 9, 2012|work=NBA|access-date=January 31, 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ac7H59HY?url=http://www.nba.com/2012/news/01/09/mavs-yi-jianlian.ap/index.html|archive-date=September 12, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/mavericks/post/_/id/4683274/yi-jianlian-will-join-mavs-in-detroit|title=Yi Jianlian will join Mavs in Detroit|date=December 9, 2011|work=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team faced the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in the playoffs and in Game 3 of the playoff series, Yi played in his first NBA playoffs game, where he scored two points for the team in five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20120503/OKCDAL/gameinfo.html|title=Mavs-Thunder box score|date=May 3, 2012|work=NBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attempted return to NBA ===
On August 22, 2016, Yi signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], returning to the NBA for the first time since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/releases/160822jianlian|title=Lakers Sign Yi Jianlian|work=NBA.com|date=August 22, 2016|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Britton|first=Patrick|url=https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1079756-report-lakers-yi-jianlian-finalizing-1-year-8m-deal|title=Report: Lakers, Yi Jianlian finalizing 1-year, $8M deal|work=TheScore.com|date=August 17, 2016|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lakers head coach [[Luke Walton]] considered Yi to be the team's best-shooting big man during the preseason, but did not provide Yi with much of a role. Yi averaged 3.0 points and 2.5 rebounds in 10.7 minutes per game over six contests with the Lakers during the preseason. Feeling he would have better opportunities elsewhere, Yi requested a release from the Lakers prior to the start of the regular season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ganguli|first=Tania|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-yi-jianlian-20161024-snap-story.html|title=Yi Jianlian asks for his release from the Lakers|work=LATimes.com|date=October 24, 2016|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakers waived him on October 24, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/releases/161024yi-jianlian-waived|title=Lakers Waive Yi Jianlian|work=NBA.com|date=October 24, 2016|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National team career ==
Yi's first major international experience came at the [[2003 FIBA Under-19 World Championship]] in which he averaged 18.9 points and 11.5 rebounds per game.&lt;ref name="ref3" /&gt; He made his debut with the [[Chinese men's national basketball team|Chinese national basketball team]] during the [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2004 Summer Olympics]] and averaged 6 points and 6 rebounds per game at the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]].&lt;ref name="ref3" /&gt; His performance impressed coaches on the Chinese national team as well as the coaches from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usabasketball.com/seniormen/2006/06_mwc_exhibition_game2_quotes.html |title=USA-China Post Game Quotes (August 7, 2006) |publisher=USA Basketball |date=August 7, 2006 |accessdate=2006-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Yi was once again selected to play for the Chinese national team at the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008 Summer Olympics]].

=== Age controversy ===
In 2004, Yi was listed as being born in 1984 during the Four Nation Tournament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Aran |last=Smith |publisher=NBADraft.net |url=http://www.nbadraft.net/jianlianstory001.asp |title=Yi Jianlian actually 19 years old |date=July 14, 2004 |accessdate=2007-05-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051222120922/http://nbadraft.net/jianlianstory001.asp |archivedate = December 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Chinese officials said that it was probably a typographical error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/sports/2004-07/19/content_1613379.htm |script-title=zh:美媒体再炒易建联年龄 一夜老了三岁潜力不再 |date=July 19, 2004 |accessdate=2008-04-01 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Fran Blinebury of ''[[The Houston Chronicle]]'' reported that Yi told [[Shane Battier]] he was 24 years old in an exhibition game before the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Fran |last=Blinebury |url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2006_4178585 |title=China rushing to match talent on court before 2008 Olympics |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=August 26, 2006 |accessdate=2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the story was refuted by both Yi and Battier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.eastday.com/eastday/sports/node72135/node72431/node72432/node76273/u1a2285195.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703142118/http://sports.eastday.com/eastday/sports/node72135/node72431/node72432/node76273/u1a2285195.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 3, 2007 |script-title=zh:年龄问题再次引起争论易建联怒斥巴蒂尔太无聊 |publisher=EastDay.com |date=August 29, 2006 |accessdate=2008-04-11 |language=zh }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.163.com/06/0901/06/2PTQJ7D8000520J1.html |title=巴蒂尔：易建联定有望进入NBA 我不知道他几岁 |publisher=163.com |date=August 29, 2006 |accessdate=2008-04-11 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yi is not the first Chinese basketball player to come under scrutiny for age discrepancy, as former NBA player [[Wang Zhizhi]] had been listed as being born in both 1977 and 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ESPN – ZhiZhi Wang Stats, News, and Photos |publisher=ESPN.com |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/players/profile?playerId=972 |accessdate=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Player profile: Wang Zhizhi, 2006 FIBA World Championship |publisher=FIBA.com |url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/06_wcm/teamPlay/play/p/competitioncode//eventid/3507/langlc/en/playernumber/22346/roundid/3507/season/0/teamnumber/262/fe_teamPlay_playProf.html |accessdate=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a senior Chinese official admitted that past youth squads had included players above the permitted age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China admits to age fraud |publisher=[[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] |date=November 15, 2006 |url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,20763990-23769,00.html |accessdate=2008-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
