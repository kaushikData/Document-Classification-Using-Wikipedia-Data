      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20540">In the pre-modern tradition, the '''aesthetics of music''' or '''musical aesthetics''' explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music.  The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term ''aesthetics'', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.
[[File:Orchestra conservatorio.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Music critic]]s listen to symphony [[orchestra]] concerts and write a review which assesses the conductor and orchestra's interpretation of the pieces they played. The critic uses a range of aesthetic evaluation tools to write their review. They may assess the tone of the orchestra, the tempos that the conductor chose for the symphony movements, the taste and judgement showed by the conductor in their creative choices, and even the selection of pieces which formed the concert program.]]

Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of [[philosophy]]. In the 20th century, important contributions to the aesthetics of music were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and [[musicologist]], and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether instrumental music could communicate emotions to the listener. Wagner and his disciples argued that instrumental music could communicate emotions and images; composers who held this belief wrote instrumental [[tone poem]]s, which attempted to tell a story or depict a landscape using instrumental music. Hanslick and his partisans asserted that instrumental music is simply patterns of sound that do not communicate any emotions or images. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a system of tuning called [[just intonation]].

Since ancient times, it has been thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in ''The Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime, music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

== History: Aesthetics and European classical music ==

=== 18th century ===
In the 18th century, music was considered so far outside the realm of aesthetic theory (then conceived of in visual terms) that music was barely mentioned in [[William Hogarth]]'s treatise ''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]''. He considered [[dance]] beautiful (closing the treatise with a discussion of the minuet), but treated music important only insofar as it could provide the proper accompaniment for the dancers.

However, by the end of the century, people began to distinguish the topic of music and its own beauty from music as part of a mixed media, as in opera and dance. [[Immanuel Kant]], whose ''Critique of Judgment'' is generally considered the most important and influential work on aesthetics in the 18th century, argued that instrumental music is beautiful but ultimately trivial. Compared to the other fine arts, it does not engage the understanding sufficiently, and it lacks moral purpose. To display the combination of genius and taste that combines ideas and beauty, Kant thought that music must be combined with words, as in song and opera.

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, the era of [[romanticism]] in music, some composers and critics argued that music should and could express ideas, images, emotions, or even a whole literary plot. Challenging Kant's reservations about instrumental music, in 1813 [[E. T. A. Hoffman]] argued that music was fundamentally the art of instrumental composition. Five years later, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' argued that instrumental music is the greatest art, because it is uniquely capable of representing the metaphysical organization of reality.

Although the Romantic movement accepted the thesis that instrumental music has representational capacities, most did not support Schopenhauer's linking of music and metaphysics. The mainstream consensus endorsed music's capacity to represent particular emotions and situations. In 1832, composer [[Robert Schumann]] stated that his piano work [[Papillons]] was "intended as a musical representation" of the final scene of a novel by [[Jean Paul]], ''[[Flegeljahre]]''. The thesis that the value of music is related to its representational function was vigorously countered by the [[Formalism (music)|formalism]] of [[Eduard Hanslick]], setting off the "War of the Romantics."

This fight divided the aesthetics into two competing groups: On one side are formalists (e.g., Hanslick), who emphasize that the rewards of music are found in appreciation of musical form or design, while on the other side are the anti-formalists, such as [[Richard Wagner]], who regarded musical form as a means to other artistic ends.

=== 20th century ===
A group of [[modernism|modernist]] writers in the early 20th century (including the poet [[Ezra Pound]]) believed that music was essentially pure because it didn't represent anything, or make reference to anything beyond itself. In a sense, they wanted to bring poetry closer to Hanslick's ideas about the autonomous, self-sufficient character of music. (Bucknell 2002) Dissenters from this view notably included [[Albert Schweitzer]], who argued against the alleged 'purity' of music in a classic work on [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]. Far from being a new debate, this disagreement between modernists and their critics was a direct continuation of the 19th-century debate about the autonomy of music.

Among 20th-century composers, [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the most prominent composer to defend the modernist idea of musical autonomy. When a composer creates music, Stravinsky claims, the only relevant thing "is his apprehension of the contour of the form, for the form is everything. He can say nothing whatever about meanings" (Stravinsky 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;115). Although listeners often look for meanings in music, Stravinsky warned that these are distractions from the musical experience.

The most distinctive development in the aesthetics of music in the 20th century was that attention was directed at the distinction between 'higher' and 'lower' music, now understood to align with the distinction between [[art music]] and [[popular music]], respectively. [[Theodor Adorno]] suggested that culture industries churn out a debased mass of unsophisticated, sentimental products that have replaced more 'difficult' and critical art forms that might lead people to actually question social life. [[False consciousness|False needs]] are cultivated in people by the culture industries. These needs can be both created and satisfied by the capitalist system, and can replace people's 'true' needs: freedom, full expression of human potential and creativity, and genuine creative happiness. Thus, those trapped in the false notions of beauty according to a capitalist mode of thinking can only hear beauty in dishonest terms (citation necessary). 

Beginning with [[Peter Kivy]]'s work in the 1970s, [[analytic philosophy]] has contributed extensively to the aesthetics of music. Analytic philosophy pays very little attention to the topic of musical beauty. Instead, Kivy inspired extensive debate about the nature of emotional expressiveness in music. He also contributed to the debate over the nature of authentic performances of older music arguing that much of the debate was incoherent because it failed to distinguish among four distinct standards of [[authentic performance]] of music (1995).

== Popular music ==

=== Bad music ===
[[Simon Frith]] (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;17-9) argues that, "'bad music' is a necessary concept for musical pleasure, for musical aesthetics." He distinguishes two common kinds of bad music: the Worst Records Ever Made type, which include "Tracks which are clearly incompetent musically; made by singers who can't sing, players who can't play, producers who can't produce," and "Tracks involving genre confusion. The most common examples are actors or TV stars recording in the latest style." Another type of "bad music" is "rock critical lists," such as "Tracks that feature sound gimmicks that have outlived their charm or novelty" and "Tracks that depend on false sentiment [...], that feature an excess of feeling molded into a radio-friendly pop song."

Frith gives three common qualities attributed to bad music: inauthentic, [in] bad taste (see also: [[kitsch]]), and stupid. He argues that "The marking off of some tracks and genres and artists as 'bad' is a necessary part of popular music pleasure; it is a way we establish our place in various music worlds. And 'bad' is a key word here because it suggests that aesthetic and ethical judgements are tied together here: not to like a record is not just a matter of taste; it is also a matter of argument, and argument that matters" (p.&amp;nbsp;28). Frith's analysis of popular music is based in sociology.

=== Philosophical aesthetics of popular music ===
[[Theodor Adorno]] was a prominent philosopher who wrote on the aesthetics of popular music. A [[Marxist]], Adorno was extremely hostile to popular music. His theory was largely formulated in response to the growing popularity of American music in Europe between World War I and World War II. As a result, Adorno often uses "jazz" as his example of what he believed was wrong with popular music; however, for Adorno this term included everyone from [[Louis Armstrong]] to [[Bing Crosby]]. He attacked popular music claiming that it is simplistic and repetitive, and encourages a fascist mindset (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;126).

However good or bad it sounds to its audience, he believed that music is genuinely good only if it challenges society through its role as an inaccessible Other. This function is advanced by musical structure, rather than lyrics. In his opinion, although many popular musicians seem to superficially oppose the political status quo, the use of familiar song forms and the artist's involvement in capitalism results in music that ultimately encourages the audience to accept things as they are - only radically [[experimental music]] can encourage audiences to become critical of prevailing society. However, the [[mass media]] cannot handle the confrontational nature of good music, and offers instead a steady diet of recycled, simplified and politically ineffective music.

Besides Adorno, Theodore Gracyk provides the most extensive philosophical analysis of popular music. He argues that conceptual categories and distinctions developed in response to art music are systematically misleading when applied to popular music (1996). At the same time, the social and political dimensions of popular music do not deprive it of aesthetic value (2007).

In 2007 musicologist and journalist [[Craig Schuftan]] published ''The Culture Club'', a book drawing links between [[modernism]] art movements and popular music of today and that of past decades and even centuries. His story involves drawing lines between [[art]], or [[high culture]], and pop, or [[low culture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illiterarty.com/reviews/book-review-culture-club-craig-schuftan&lt;/ref&gt; A more scholarly study of the same topic, ''Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde'', was published five years earlier by philosopher Bernard Gendron.

In Germany, the musicologist [[Ralf von Appen]] (2007) has published a book on the aesthetics of popular music that focuses on everyday judgments of popular records. He analyzes the structures and aesthetic categories behind judgments found on amazon.com concerning records by musicians such as Bob Dylan, Eminem, Queens of the Stone Age etc. In a second step, von Appen interprets these findings on the basis of current theoretical positions in the field of philosophical aesthetics.

==Overview==
''Algorithms of Oppression'' is a text based on over six years of academic research on Google search algorithms. Noble argues that though algorithms themselves may not be racist, they can [[Algorithmic bias|reflect the biases]] and values of the people who create them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/02/06/scholar-sets-twitter-furor-critiquing-book-he-hasnt-read|title=Scholar sets off Twitter furor by critiquing a book he hasn't read|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/algorithms-of-oppression-racist/|title=Can an algorithm be racist?

==Critical reception==
Critical reception for ''Algorithms of Oppression'' has been largely positive. In the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'', Emily Drabinski writes, "What emerges from these pages is the sense that Google’s algorithms of oppression comprise just one of the hidden infrastructures that govern our daily lives, and that the others are likely just as hard-coded with white supremacy and misogyny as the one that Noble explores."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/ideologies-of-boring-things-the-internet-and-infrastructures-of-race/#!|title=Ideologies of Boring Things: The Internet and Infrastructures of Race - Los Angeles Review of Books|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[PopMatters]],'' Hans Rollman describes writes that ''Algorithms of Oppression'' "demonstrate[s] that search engines, and in particular [[Google]], are not simply imperfect machines, but systems designed by humans in ways that replicate the power structures of the western countries where they are built, complete with all the sexism and racism that are built into those structures."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In ''[[Booklist]],'' reviewer Lesley Williams states, "Noble’s study should prompt some soul-searching about our reliance on commercial search engines and about digital social equity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Algorithms-of-Oppression-How-Search-Engines-Reinforce-Racism-Safiya-Umoja-Noble/pid=9240185|title=Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism, by Safiya Umoja  Noble {{!}} Booklist Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early February 2018, ''Algorithms of Oppression'' received press attention when the official [[Twitter]] account for the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] expressed criticism of the book, citing that the thesis of the text, based on the text of the book's official blurb on commercial sites, could not be reproduced. IEEE's outreach historian, Alexander Magoun, later revealed that he had not read the book, and issued an apology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Tooth development''' or '''odontogenesis''' is the process in which [[teeth]] develop and grow into the [[mouth]]. Tooth development varies among species.

== Tooth development in vertebrates ==

===Fish===
In [[fish]], [[Hox gene]] expression regulates mechanisms for [[teeth|tooth]] initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors =Fraser GJ, Hulsey CD, Bloomquist RF, Uyesugi K, Manley NR, Streelman JT |title=An Ancient Gene Network Is Co-opted for Teeth on Old and New Jaws |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=e31 |date=February 2009|pmid=19215146 |pmc=2637924|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000031|editor1-last=Jernvall|editor1-first=Jukka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Fraser GJ, Bloomquist RF, Streelman JT |title=A periodic pattern generator for dental diversity|journal=BMC Biology |volume=6 |issue= |page=32 |year=2008 |pmid=18625062 |pmc=2496899|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-6-32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[shark]]s continuously produce new teeth throughout their lives&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ms-starship.com/sciencenew/sharks.htm Dave Abbott, ''Sharks'', found here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/00220345700490031501 |author =Boyne PJ |title=Study of the chronologic development and eruption of teeth in elasmobranchs |journal=Journal of Dental Research |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=556–60 |year=1970 |pmid=5269110 |url=http://jdr.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=5269110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author =Sasagawa I |title=The fine structure of initial mineralisation during tooth development in the gummy shark, Mustelus manazo, Elasmobranchia |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=164 |issue= |pages=175–87 |date=June 1989 |pmid=2606790 |pmc=1256608}}&lt;/ref&gt; via a drastically different mechanism. Shark teeth form from modified [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s near the tongue and move outward on the jaw in rows until they are eventually dislodged.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Williams, ''Jaws: The early years'', found here [http://www.cmnh.org/collections/vertpaleo/jaws/jaws.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Their scales, called [[dermal denticle]]s, and [[teeth]] are [[homologous organ]]s.&lt;ref name="Luan2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luan|first=X.|last2=Ito |first2=Y. |last3=Diekwisch |first3=T.G.H.|title=Evolution and development of Hertwig's epithelial root sheath|journal=Developmental Dynamics|year=2005|volume=235|pages=1167–1180|pmid=16450392|issue=5|doi=10.1002/dvdy.20674|pmc=2734338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammals===
Generally, tooth development in non-human [[mammal]]s is similar to [[human tooth development]]. The variations usually lie in the morphology, [[Dentition#Dental formula|number]], development timeline, and types of teeth.&lt;ref&gt;Frandson and Spurgeon, ''Anatomy and Physiology of Farm Animals.'', p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some mammals' teeth do develop differently than humans'.

In [[mouse|mice]], [[Wnt signaling pathway|WNT]] signals are required for the initiation of [[teeth|tooth]] development.&lt;ref name=pmid11044393&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Dassule HR, Lewis P, Bei M, Maas R, McMahon AP |title=Sonic hedgehog regulates growth and morphogenesis of the tooth |journal=Development |volume=127 |issue=22 |pages=4775–85 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11044393 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11044393}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Järvinen E, Salazar-Ciudad I, Birchmeier W, Taketo MM, Jernvall J, Thesleff I |title=Continuous tooth generation in mouse is induced by activated epithelial Wnt/β-catenin signaling |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=103 |issue=49 |pages=18627–32 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17121988 |pmc=1693713 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0607289103}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rodent]]s' teeth continually grow, forcing them to wear down their teeth by gnawing on various materials.&lt;ref&gt;Caceci.  ''Veterinary Histology'' with subtitle "Digestive System: Oral Cavity" found here {{cite web|url=http://education.vetmed.vt.edu/Curriculum/VM8054/Labs/Lab17/Lab17.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430010601/http://education.vetmed.vt.edu/Curriculum/VM8054/Labs/Lab17/Lab17.htm |archivedate=2006-04-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; If rodents are prevented from gnawing, their teeth eventually puncture the roofs of their mouths. In addition, rodent incisors consist of two halves, known as the crown and root analogues. The labial half is made of enamel and resembles a crown, while the lingual half is made of dentin and resembles a root. The mineral distribution in [[rodent]] enamel is different from that of [[monkey]]s, [[dog]]s, [[pig]]s, and [[human]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/002203457905800224011 |author =Fejerskov O |title=Human dentition and experimental animals |journal=Journal of Dental Research |volume=58 |issue=Spec Issue B |pages=725–34 |date=March 1979 |pmid=105027 |url=http://jdr.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=105027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[horse teeth]], enamel and dentin layers are intertwined, which increases the strength and decreases the wear rate of the teeth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brushflossandmouthwash.com Jake Andersen, DMD, ''Teeth'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091029215043/http://encarta.msn.com/text_761561931__1/Teeth.html Encarta]&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, horse teeth do not "grow" indefinitely.  Rather, existing tooth erupts from below the gumline.  Horses start to "run out" of erupting tooth in their early 30's and in the rare case they live long enough, the roots of their teeth will fall out completely in the middle to latter part of their third decade.

In [[manatee]]s, mandibular molars develop separately from the jaw and are encased in a bony shell separated by soft tissue. This also occurs in [[elephant]]s' successional teeth, which erupt to replace worn teeth.

All members of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Tubulidentata]] have no incisors or canines, their teeth have no enamel, and their molars grow continuously from the root.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/resources/anatomical_images/family_pages/tubulidentata/tubulidentata.jpg/view.html Class Mammalia, Order Tubulidentata, Family Orycteropodidae, Species Orycteropus afer]," University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. Page accessed November 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Invertebrate "teeth" ==

True teeth are unique to [[vertebrates]],&lt;ref name="kardong"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kardong|first=Kenneth V.|title=Vertebrates: comparative anatomy, function, evolution|year=1995|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-697-21991-7|pages=55, 57}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some invertebrates have [[Analogy (biology)|analogous structures]] sometimes called "teeth". The [[organism]] with the simplest [[genome]] bearing such "[[teeth]]" is probably the [[worm]] genus [[Ancylostoma]] ([[Ancylostoma duodenale]], [[Necator americanus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nematode.net/Species.Summaries/Ancylostoma.duodenale/index.php|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516010133/http://www.nematode.net/Species.Summaries/Ancylostoma.duodenale/index.php|archivedate = 2008-05-16|title = Ancylostoma duodenale|publisher = Nematode.net Genome Sequencing Center |accessdate = 2009-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molluscs have a structure called a [[radula]] which bears a ribbon of [[chitin]]ous "teeth". However, these are histologically and developmentally different from vertebrate teeth, and are unlikely to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]]. For example, vertebrate teeth develop from a [[neural crest]] mesenchyme-derived [[dental papilla]], and the neural crest is specific to vertebrates, as are tissues such as [[Tooth enamel|enamel]].&lt;ref name="kardong"/&gt;

'''Biodegradation''' is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as [[bacteria]], [[fungi]].{{efn| The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] defines biodegradation as "degradation caused by enzymatic process resulting from the action of cells" and notes that the definition is "modified to exclude abiotic enzymatic processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vert M, Doi Y, Hellwich KH, Hess M, Hodge P, Kubisa P, Rinaudo M, Schué F | title=Terminology for biorelated polymers and applications (IUPAC Recommendations 2012) |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |year=2012 |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=377–410 |doi=10.1351/PAC-REC-10-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Biodegradation| vauthors = Focht DD | work = AccessScience |doi=10.1036/1097-8542.422025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
The process of biodegradation can be divided into three stages: biodeterioration, biofragmentation, and assimilation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Biodeterioration is a surface-level degradation that modifies the mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of the material. This stage occurs when the material is exposed to abiotic factors in the outdoor environment and allows for further degradation by weakening the material's structure. Some abiotic factors that influence these initial changes are compression (mechanical), light, temperature, and chemicals in the environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lucas N, Bienaime C, Belloy C, Queneudec M, Silvestre F, Nava-Saucedo JE | title = Polymer biodegradation: mechanisms and estimation techniques | journal = Chemosphere | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 429–42 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18723204 | doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.06.064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;While biodeterioration typically occurs as the first stage of biodegradation, it can in some cases be parallel to biofragmentation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Muller|first=Rolf-Joachim | editor-first =  Alexander | editor-last = Steinbüchel | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Biodegradability of Polymers: Regulations and Methods for Testing |title=Biopolymers |publisher=Wiley-VCH |isbn=978-3-527-30290-1 | chapter-url = https://application.wiley-vch.de/books/biopoly/pdf_v10/vol10_19.pdf | doi = 10.1002/3527600035.bpola012 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofragmentation of a polymer is the lytic process in which bonds within a polymer are cleaved, generating oligomers and monomers in its place.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The steps taken to fragment these materials also differ based on the presence of oxygen in the system. The breakdown of materials by microorganisms when oxygen is present is aerobic digestion, and the breakdown of materials when is oxygen is not present is anaerobic digestion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polimernet.com/Docs/Aerobic%20-%20Anaerobic%20Biodegredation%20en.pdf|title=Aerobic and Anaerobic Biodegradation| work = Fundementals of Aerobic &amp; Anaerobic Biodegradation Process | publisher = Polimernet Plastik San. Tic. Ltd. Şti. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between these processes is that anaerobic reactions produce methane, while aerobic reactions do not (however, both reactions produce carbon dioxide, water, some type of residue, and a new biomass).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ezproxy.library.wur.nl/193543|title=Analytical Methods for Monitoring Biodegradation Techniques|last=Van der Zee|first=Maarten | name-list-format = vanc |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, aerobic digestion typically occurs more rapidly than anaerobic digestion, while anaerobic digestion does a better job reducing the volume and mass of the material.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Due to anaerobic digestion's ability to reduce the volume and mass of waste materials and produce a natural gas, anaerobic digestion technology is widely used for  waste management systems and as a source of local, renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Klinkner | first = Blake Anthony | name-list-format = vanc | title = Anaerobic Digestion as a Renewable Energy Source and Waste Management Technology: What Must be Done for this Technology to Realize Success in the United States? | url = https://scholarship.law.umassd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&amp;context=umlr | journal = University of Massachusetts Law Review | volume = 9 | pages = 68–96 | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting products from biofragmentation are then integrated into microbial cells, this is the assimilation stage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some of the products from fragmentation are easily transported within the cell by membrane carriers. However, others still have to undergo biotransformation reactions to yield products that can then be transported inside the cell. Once inside the cell, the products enter catabolic pathways that either lead to the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or elements of the cells structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Factors affecting biodegradation rate ==
In practice, almost all chemical compounds and materials are subject to biodegradation processes. The significance, however, is in the relative rates of such processes, such as days, weeks, years or centuries. A number of factors determine the rate at which this degradation of organic compounds occurs. Factors include [[light]], [[water]], [[oxygen]] and temperature.&lt;ref name="pmid29972726"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haider T, Völker C, Kramm J, Landfester K, Wurm FR | title = Plastics of the future? The impact of biodegradable polymers on the environment and on society | journal = Angewandte Chemie (International Ed. In English) | volume = | issue = | pages = | date = July 2018 | pmid = 29972726 | doi = 10.1002/anie.201805766 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The degradation rate of many organic compounds is limited by their bioavailability, which is the rate at which a substance is absorbed into a system or made available at the site of physiological activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bioavailability|title=Definition of BIOAVAILABILITY|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as compounds must be released into solution before organisms can degrade them.The rate of biodegradation can be measured in a number of ways. [[Respirometry]] tests can be used for [[aerobic microbes]]. First one places a solid waste sample in a container with microorganisms and soil, and then aerates the mixture. Over the course of several days, microorganisms digest the sample bit by bit and produce carbon dioxide – the resulting amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; serves as an indicator of degradation. Biodegradability can also be measured by anaerobic microbes and the amount of methane or alloy that they are able to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Andy | last = Jessop | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://commercialwaste.trade/how-is-biodegradability-measured/ |title=How is biodegradability measured? |date=2015-09-16 |work=Commercial Waste |access-date=2018-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It’s important to note factors that effect biodegradation rates during product testing to ensure that the results produced are accurate and reliable. Several materials will test as being biodegradable under optimal conditions in a lab for approval but these results may not reflect real world outcomes where factors are more variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Research of the biodegradability of degradable/biodegradable plastic material in various types of environments| vauthors = Adamcova D, Radziemska M, Fronczyk J, Zloch J, Vaverkova MD | journal =  Przegląd Naukowy. Inżynieria I Kształtowanie Środowiska |year=2017|isbn=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a material may have tested as biodegrading at a high rate in the lab may not degrade at a high rate in a landfill because landfills often lack light, water, and microbial activity that are necessary for degradation to occur.&lt;ref name = "SLH"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/1543-measuring-biodegradability|title=Measuring biodegradability|work=Science Learning Hub|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is very important that there are standards for plastic biodegradable products, which have a large impact on the environment. The development and use of accurate standard test methods can help ensure that all plastics that are being produced and commercialized will actually biodegrade in natural environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1995 |editor-last=Scott |editor-first=Gerald |editor2-last=Gilead |editor2-first=Dan | name-list-format = vanc |title=Degradable Polymers | publisher = Dordrecht Springer | location = Netherlands | doi = 10.1007/978-94-011-0571-2 |isbn=978-94-010-4253-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One test that has been developed for this purpose is DINV 54900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Witt U, Yamamoto M, Seeliger U, Müller RJ, Warzelhan V | title = Biodegradable Polymeric Materials-Not the Origin but the Chemical Structure Determines Biodegradability | journal = Angewandte Chemie | volume = 38 | issue = 10 | pages = 1438–1442 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 29711570 | doi = 10.1002/(sici)1521-3773(19990517)38:10&lt;1438::aid-anie1438&gt;3.0.co;2-u }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plastics ==
{{Main|Biodegradable plastic#Examples of biodegradable plastics}}

The term Biodegradable Plastics refers to a material that maintains its mechanical strength during practical use but break down into low-weight compounds and non-toxic byproducts after their use.&lt;ref name = "Ikada_2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ikada |first=Yoshito |last2=Tsuji |first2=Hideto | name-list-format = vanc |date= February 2000 | title = Biodegradable polyesters for medical and ecological applications |journal=Macromolecular Rapid Communications |volume=21|issue=3|pages=117–132 |doi=10.1002/(sici)1521-3927(20000201)21:3&lt;117::aid-marc117&gt;3.0.co;2-x  | url = http://web.mit.edu/course/10/10.569/www/ikadaPEreview.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This breakdown is made possible through an attack of microorganisms on the material, which is typically a non-water soluble polymer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such materials can be obtained through chemical synthesis, fermentation by microorganisms, and from chemically modified natural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flieger M, Kantorová M, Prell A, Rezanka T, Votruba J | title = Biodegradable plastics from renewable sources | journal = Folia Microbiologica | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–44 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12744074 | doi = 10.1007/bf02931273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plastics]] biodegrade at highly variable rates.  [[Polyvinylchloride|PVC]]-based plumbing is selected for handling [[sewage]] because PVC resists biodegradation.  Some packaging materials on the other hand are being developed that would degrade readily upon exposure to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kyrikou |first=Ioanna |last2=Briassoulis |first2=Demetres | name-list-format = vanc |date=12 Apr 2007 |title=Biodegradation of Agricultural Plastic Films: A Critical Review  |journal=Journal of Polymers and the Environment |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=125–150 |doi= 10.1007/s10924-007-0053-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of [[synthetic polymer]]s that biodegrade quickly include [[polycaprolactone]], other [[polyesters]] and aromatic-aliphatic esters, due to their ester bonds being susceptible to attack by water. A prominent example is [[poly-3-hydroxybutyrate]], the renewably derived [[polylactic acid]], and the synthetic polycaprolactone. Others are the cellulose-based cellulose acetate and celluloid (cellulose nitrate).

:[[File:Polylactid sceletal.svg|thumb|150px|[[Polylactic acid]] is an example of a plastic that biodegrades quickly.]]
Under [[anaerobic decomposition|low oxygen]] conditions plastics break down more slowly. The breakdown process can be accelerated in specially designed [[compost heap]]. Starch-based plastics will degrade within two to four months in a home compost bin, while polylactic acid is largely undecomposed, requiring higher temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pls/portallive/docs/1/33773706.PDF |title= Section 6: Biodegradability of Packaging Waste |publisher=Www3.imperial.ac.uk |date= |access-date=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polycaprolactone and polycaprolactone-starch composites decompose slower, but the starch content accelerates decomposition by leaving behind a porous, high surface area polycaprolactone. Nevertheless, it takes many months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wu |first1=Chin-San | name-list-format = vanc |title=Physical properties and biodegradability of maleated-polycaprolactone/starch composite |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |date=January 2003 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=127–134 |doi=10.1016/S0141-3910(02)00393-2 | url = http://www.kyu.edu.tw/93/epaperv6/93-129.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.453.4220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, a bacterium named ''[[Ideonella sakaiensis]]'' was found to biodegrade [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]].

Many [[plastic producer]]s have gone so far even to say that their plastics are compostable, typically listing [[corn starch]] as an ingredient. However, these claims are questionable because the [[plastics industry]] operates under its own definition of compostable:
:"that which is capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a compost site such that the material is not visually distinguishable and breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with known compostable materials." (Ref: [[ASTM]] D 6002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compostable.info/compostable.htm | title = Compostable |publisher=Compostable.info |date= |access-date=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "composting" is often used informally to describe the biodegradation of packaging materials. Legal definitions exist for compostability, the process that leads to compost.  Four criteria are offered by the European Union:&lt;ref name="EN 13432"&gt;{{cite web|title=Requirements of the EN 13432 standard |url= https://docs.european-bioplastics.org/publications/bp/EUBP_BP_En_13432.pdf | date = April 2015| work =  European Bioplastics  |access-date=July 22, 2017|location=Brussels, Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Breulmann M, Künkel A, Philipp S, Reimer V, Siegenthaler KO, Skupin G, Yamamoto M | chapter = Polymers, Biodegradable | title = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | year = 2012 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | doi = 10.1002/14356007.n21_n01 | isbn = 978-3527306732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Chemical composition''': volatile matter and heavy metals as well as fluorine should be limited.
#'''Biodegradability''': the conversion of &gt;90% of the original material into CO2, water and minerals by biological processes within 6 months.
#'''Disintegrability''': at least 90% of the original mass should be decomposed into particles that are able to pass through a 2x2 mm sieve.
#'''Quality''': absence of toxic substances and other substances that impede composting.

== Biodegradable technology ==
Now biodegradable technology has become a highly developed market with applications in product [[packaging]], production, and medicine.  The biodegradation of biomass offers some guidances.&lt;ref name="pmid1736301"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luzier WD | title = Materials derived from biomass/biodegradable materials | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 839–42 | date = February 1992 | pmid = 1736301 | pmc = 48337 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyesters are known to biodegrade.&lt;ref name="pmid12161646"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gross RA, Kalra B | title = Biodegradable polymers for the environment | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = 5582 | pages = 803–7 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12161646 | doi = 10.1126/science.297.5582.803  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxo-biodegradation is defined by [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] (the European Standards Organisation) as "degradation resulting from [[oxidative]] and cell-mediated phenomena, either simultaneously or successively." Whilst sometimes described as "oxo-fragmentable," and "oxo-degradable" these terms describe only the first or oxidative phase and should not be used for material which degrades by the process of oxo-biodegradation defined by CEN: the correct description is "oxo-biodegradable."

By combining plastic products with very large polymer molecules, which contain only [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]], with [[oxygen]] in the air, the product is rendered capable of [[decomposing]] in anywhere from a week to one to two years. This reaction occurs even without prodegradant additives but at a very slow rate. That is why conventional plastics, when discarded, [[plastic waste|persist for a long time in the environment]]. Oxo-biodegradable formulations catalyze and accelerate the biodegradation process but it takes considerable skill and experience to balance the ingredients within the formulations so as to provide the product with a useful life for a set period, followed by degradation and biodegradation.&lt;ref name="pmid15864950"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agamuthu P, Faizura PN | title = Biodegradability of degradable plastic waste | journal = Waste Management &amp; Research : The Journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–100 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15864950 | doi = 10.1177/0734242X05051045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodegradable technology is especially utilized by the [[bio-medical]] community. Biodegradable polymers are classified into three groups:
medical, ecological, and dual application, while in terms of origin they are divided into two groups: natural and synthetic.&lt;ref name = "Ikada_2000" /&gt; The Clean Technology Group is exploiting the use of [[supercritical carbon dioxide]], which under high pressure at room temperature is a solvent that can use biodegradable plastics to make polymer drug coatings. The polymer (meaning a material composed of molecules with repeating structural units that form a long chain) is used to encapsulate a drug prior to injection in the body and is based on [[lactic acid]], a compound normally produced in the body, and is thus able to be excreted naturally. The coating is designed for controlled release over a period of time, reducing the number of injections required and maximizing the therapeutic benefit.  Professor Steve Howdle states that biodegradable polymers are particularly attractive for use in [[drug delivery]], as once introduced into the body they require no retrieval or further manipulation and are degraded into soluble, non-toxic by-products. Different polymers degrade at different rates within the body and therefore polymer selection can be tailored to achieve desired release rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Using Green Chemistry to Deliver Cutting Edge Drugs | author = The University of Nottingham | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070913132945.htm | work = Science Daily | date = September 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other biomedical applications include the use of biodegradable, elastic shape-memory polymers. Biodegradable implant materials can now be used for minimally invasive surgical procedures through degradable thermoplastic polymers. These polymers are now able to change their shape with increase of temperature, causing shape memory capabilities as well as easily degradable sutures. As a result, implants can now fit through small incisions, doctors can easily perform complex deformations, and sutures and other material aides can naturally biodegrade after a completed surgery.&lt;ref name="pmid11976407"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lendlein A, Langer R | title = Biodegradable, elastic shape-memory polymers for potential biomedical applications | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5573 | pages = 1673–6 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11976407 | doi = 10.1126/science.1066102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodegradation vs. composting ==
There is no universal definition for biodegradation and there are various definitions of composting, which has led to much confusion between the terms. They are often lumped together; however, they do not have the same meaning. Biodegradation is the naturally-occurring breakdown of materials by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi or other biological activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gómez |first1=Eddie F. |last2=Michel |first2=Frederick C. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Biodegradability of conventional and bio-based plastics and natural fiber composites during composting, anaerobic digestion and long-term soil incubation |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |date=December 2013 |volume=98 |issue=12 |pages=2583–2591 |doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2013.09.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composting is a human-driven process in which biodegradation occurs under a specific set of circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bpiworld.org/Composting|title=Biodegradable Products Institute - Composting|website=bpiworld.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant difference between the two is that one process is naturally-occurring and one is human-driven.

Biodegradable material is capable of decomposing without an oxygen source (anaerobically) into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass, but the timeline is not very specifically defined. Similarly, compostable material breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass; however, compostable material also breaks down into inorganic compounds. The process for composting is more specifically defined, as it controlled by humans. Essentially, composting is an accelerated biodegradation process due to optimized circumstances.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Magdoff|first=Fred | name-list-format = vanc |date= November 1993 |title=Building Soils for Better Crops |journal=Soil Science |volume=156 |issue=5 |pages=371 |doi=10.1097/00010694-199311000-00014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the end product of composting not only returns to its previous state, but also generates and adds beneficial microorganisms to the soil called humus. This organic matter can be used in gardens and on farms to help grow healthier plants in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.accessscience.com/content/325510|title=Humus|last=Morris|first=Schnitzer|last2= Martin |first2 = James P. | name-list-format = vanc | work =AccessScience |doi=10.1036/1097-8542.325510|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composting more consistently occurs within a shorter time frame since it is a more defined process and is expedited by human intervention. Biodegradation can occur in different time frames under different circumstances, but is meant to occur naturally without human intervention.
[[File:Organic Waste Disposal Streams.pdf|thumb|This figure represents the different paths of disposal for organic waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Kranert M, Behnsen A, Schultheis A, Steinbach D | chapter =Composting in the Framework of the EU Landfill Directive |date=2002 | title = Microbiology of Composting |pages=473–486 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-08724-4_39 |isbn=9783642087059 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Even within composting, there are different circumstances under which this can occur. The two main types of composting are at-home versus commercial. Both produce healthy soil to be reused - the main difference lies in what materials are able to go into the process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At-home composting is mostly used for food scraps and excess garden materials, such as weeds. Commercial composting is capable of breaking down more complex plant-based products, such as corn-based plastics and larger pieces of material, like tree branches. Commercial composting begins with a manual breakdown of the materials using a grinder or other machine to initiate the process. Because at-home composting usually occurs on a smaller scale and does not involve large machinery, these materials would not fully decompose in at-home composting. Furthermore, one study has compared and contrasted home and industrial composting, concluding that there are advantages and disadvantages to both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martínez-Blanco J, Colón J, Gabarrell X, Font X, Sánchez A, Artola A, Rieradevall J | title = The use of life cycle assessment for the comparison of biowaste composting at home and full scale | journal = Waste Management | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 983–94 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20211555 | doi = 10.1016/j.wasman.2010.02.023 | url = http://ddd.uab.cat/record/163720 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following studies provide examples in which composting has been defined as a subset of biodegradation in a scientific context. The first study, "Assessment of Biodegradability of Plastics Under Simulated Composting Conditions in a Laboratory Test Setting," clearly examines composting as a set of circumstances that falls under the category of degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Starnecker A, Menner M  |date=1996-01-01|title=Assessment of biodegradability of plastics under simulated composting conditions in a laboratory test system |journal=International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation|language=en|volume=37|issue=1–2|pages=85–92|doi=10.1016/0964-8305(95)00089-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, this next study looked at the biodegradation and composting effects of chemically and physically crosslinked polylactic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-02-01|title=Some composting and biodegradation effects of physically or chemically crosslinked poly(lactic acid) |journal=Polymer Testing |volume=31|issue=1|pages=83–92|doi=10.1016/j.polymertesting.2011.09.012 |last1=Żenkiewicz |first1=Marian |last2=Malinowski |first2=Rafał |last3=Rytlewski |first3=Piotr |last4=Richert |first4=Agnieszka |last5=Sikorska |first5=Wanda |last6=Krasowska |first6=Katarzyna | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably discussing composting and biodegrading as two distinct terms. The third and final study reviews European standardization of biodegradable and compostable material in the packaging industry, again using the terms separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Avella M, Bonadies E, Martuscelli E, Rimedio R |date=2001-01-01|title=European current standardization for plastic packaging recoverable through composting and biodegradation |journal=Polymer Testing|language=en|volume=20|issue=5|pages=517–521|doi=10.1016/S0142-9418(00)00068-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between these terms is crucial because waste management confusion leads to improper disposal of materials by people on a daily basis. Biodegradation technology has led to massive improvements in how we dispose of waste; there now exist trash, recycling, and compost bins in order to optimize the disposal process. However, if these waste streams are commonly and frequently confused, then the disposal process is not at all optimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Akullian A, Karp C, Austin K, Durbin D | title =  Plastic Bag Externalities and Policy in Rhode Island | url = http://seattlebagtax.org/referencedpdfs/en-akullianetal.pdf | journal = Brown Policy Review | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodegradable and compostable materials have been developed to ensure more of human waste is able to breakdown and return to its previous state, or in the case of composting even add nutrients to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Song JH, Murphy RJ, Narayan R, Davies GB | title = Biodegradable and compostable alternatives to conventional plastics | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 364 | issue = 1526 | pages = 2127–39 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19528060 | pmc = 2873018 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a compostable product is thrown out as opposed to composted and sent to a landfill, these inventions and efforts are wasted. Therefore, it is important for average citizens to understand the difference between these terms so that materials can be disposed of properly and efficiently.

== Environmental and social effects ==
Plastic pollution from illegal dumping poses health risks to wildlife. Animals often mistake plastics for food, resulting in intestinal entanglement. Slow-degrading chemicals, like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), nonylphenol (NP), and pesticides also found in plastics, can release into environments and subsequently also be ingested by wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Webb |first=Hayden |last2=Arnott |first2=Jaimys |last3=Crawford |first3=Russell |last4=Ivanova |first4=Elena |last5=Webb |first5=Hayden K. |last6=Arnott |first6=Jaimys |last7=Crawford |first7=Russell J. |last8=Ivanova|first8=Elena P. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2012-12-28|title=Plastic Degradation and Its Environmental Implications with Special Reference to Poly(ethylene terephthalate) |journal=Polymers |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.3390/polym5010001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel Carson, a notable environmentalist in the 1960s, provided one of the first key studies on the consequences associated with chemical ingestion in wildlife, specifically birds. In her work ''Silent Spring'', she wrote on [[DDT]], a pesticide commonly used in human agricultural activities. Birds that ate the tainted bugs, Carson found, were more likely to produce eggs with thin and weak shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosner D, Markowitz G | title = Persistent pollutants: a brief history of the discovery of the widespread toxicity of chlorinated hydrocarbons | journal = Environmental Research | volume = 120 | pages = 126–33 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 22999707 | doi = 10.1016/j.envres.2012.08.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These chemicals also play a role in human health, as consumption of tainted food (in processes called biomagnification and bioaccumulation) has been linked to issues such as cancers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelly BC, Ikonomou MG, Blair JD, Morin AE, Gobas FA | title = Food web-specific biomagnification of persistent organic pollutants | journal = Science | volume = 317 | issue = 5835 | pages = 236–9 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17626882 | doi = 10.1126/science.1138275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; neurological dysfunction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Passos CJ, Mergler D | title = Human mercury exposure and adverse health effects in the Amazon: a review | journal = Cadernos de Saude Publica | volume = 24 Suppl 4 | pages = s503–20 | date = 2008 | pmid = 18797727 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and hormonal changes. A well-known example of biomagnification impacting health in recent times is the increased exposure to dangerously high levels of mercury in fish, which can affect sex hormones in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rana SV | title = Perspectives in endocrine toxicity of heavy metals--a review | journal = Biological Trace Element Research | volume = 160 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24898714 | doi = 10.1007/s12011-014-0023-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In efforts to remediate the damages done by slow-degrading plastics, detergents, metals, and other pollutants created by humans, economic costs have become a concern. Marine litter in particular is notably difficult to quanitfy and review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Stephanie |last2=Watkins |first2=Emma |last3=Farmer |first3=Andrew |last4=Brink |first4=Patrick ten |last5=Schweitzer |first5=Jean-Pierre | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = The Economics of Marine Litter|date=2015 | title =Marine Anthropogenic Litter |pages=367–394 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_14 |isbn=978-3-319-16509-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the World Trade Institute estimate that cleanup initiatives' cost (specifically in ocean ecosystems) has hit close to thirteen billion dollars a year.&lt;ref name= "Matsangou_2018"&gt;{{cite news | first = Elizabeth | last = Matsangou | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2 July 2018 | url= https://www.worldfinance.com/markets/counting-the-cost-of-plastic-pollution | title=Counting the cost of plastic pollution |access-date=17 September 2018 | work = World Finance }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main concern stems from marine environments, with the biggest cleanup efforts centering around garbage patches in the ocean. In 2017, a [[Great Pacific garbage patch|garbage patch the size of Mexico]] was found in the Pacific Ocean. It is estimated to be upwards of a million square miles in size. While the patch contains more obvious examples of litter (plastic bottles, cans, and bags), tiny microplastics are nearly impossible to clean up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rochman CM, Cook AM, Koelmans AA | title = Plastic debris and policy: Using current scientific understanding to invoke positive change | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | volume = 35 | issue = 7 | pages = 1617–26 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27331654 | doi = 10.1002/etc.3408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''National Geographic'' reports that even more non-biodegradable materials are finding their way into vulnerable environments - nearly thirty-eight million pieces a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Shaena | last = Montanari | name-list-format = vanc |url= https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/07/ocean-plastic-patch-south-pacific-spd/ |title=Plastic Garbage Patch Bigger Than Mexico Found in Pacific |date=2017-07-25 |access-date=2018-09-17 | work = National Geographic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials that have not degraded can also serve as shelter for invasive species, such as tube worms and barnacles. When the ecosystem changes in response to the invasive species, resident species and the natural balance of resources, genetic diversity, and species richness is altered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gregory MR | title = Environmental implications of plastic debris in marine settings--entanglement, ingestion, smothering, hangers-on, hitch-hiking and alien invasions | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 364 | issue = 1526 | pages = 2013–25 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19528053 | pmc = 2873013 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0265 | url = http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1526/2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors may support local economies in way of hunting and aquaculture, which suffer in response to the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Villarrubia-Gómez P, Cornell SE, Fabres J |date=2018-10-01|title=Marine plastic pollution as a planetary boundary threat – The drifting piece in the sustainability puzzle |journal=Marine Policy|language=en|volume=96|pages=213–220|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2017.11.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, coastal communities which rely heavily on [[ecotourism]] lose revenue thanks to a buildup of pollution, as their beaches or shores are no longer desirable to travelers. The World Trade Institute also notes that the communities who often feel most of the effects of poor biodegradation are poorer countries without the means to pay for their cleanup.&lt;ref name= "Matsangou_2018" /&gt; In a positive feedback loop effect, they in turn have trouble controlling their own pollution sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hajat A, Hsia C, O'Neill MS | title = Socioeconomic Disparities and Air Pollution Exposure: a Global Review | journal = Current Environmental Health Reports | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 440–50 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26381684 | pmc = 4626327 | doi = 10.1007/s40572-015-0069-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology of "biodegradable" ==
The first known use of ''biodegradable'' in a biological context was in 1959 when it was  employed to describe the breakdown of material into innocuous components by [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/biodegradable|title=Definition of BIODEGRADABLE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now ''biodegradable'' is commonly associated with environmentally friendly products that are part of the earth's innate cycles and capable of decomposing back into natural elements.

The '''Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology''' (CEH) is the [[United Kingdom]]'s Centre of Excellence for integrated research in [[hydrology]], terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and their interaction with the atmosphere. As part of the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC), it provides services based on innovative, independent and interdisciplinary science and long-term environmental monitoring, forming an integral part of NERC's strategy.

The Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology is one of four environmental research organisations wholly owned by NERC, along with the [[British Geological Survey]], the [[British Antarctic Survey]] and the [[National Oceanography Centre]]. The single organisation CEH was established in 2000 from the combination of four existing NERC research centres. &lt;ref name="peer.eu1" /&gt;

The Centre operates from four sites across the UK: [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] (headquarters), [[Edinburgh]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] (jointly with the [[Lancaster Environment Centre]]) and [[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]] (jointly with [[Bangor University]]).

The current director is Mark J. Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=How CEH operates |url=http://www.ceh.ac.uk/science/operate.html |publisher=[[Natural Environment Research Council]] |work=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology website |accessdate=18 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319192933/http://ceh.ac.uk/science/operate.html |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Past directors include [[Pat Nuttall]] (2001–11).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= |title=Professor Mark Bailey becomes acting Director of the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology |url=http://www.ceh.ac.uk/news/news_archive/acting-director-ceh_2011_07.html |date=1 March 2011 |publisher=[[Natural Environment Research Council]] |work=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology website |accessdate=16 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723165002/http://ceh.ac.uk/news/news_archive/acting-director-ceh_2011_07.html |archivedate=23 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEH is a member of the [[Partnership for European Environmental Research (PEER)]].&lt;ref name="peer.eu1" /&gt;

==History==
CEH was formed in April 2000 by a merger of four institutions: the Institute of Hydrology, the '''Institute of Terrestrial Ecology''', the Institute of Freshwater Ecology and the Institute of Virology and Environmental Microbiology&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author= |title=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology timeline |url=http://www.ceh.ac.uk/sites/default/files/CEH%20timeline.pdf  |publisher=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology |work=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology website |accessdate=27 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3657">A '''cistron''' is an alternative term to a [[gene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewin | first = Benjamin | name-list-format = vanc | authorlink = Benjamin Lewin | title = Genes VII | year = 2000 | publisher = Oxford University Press and Cell Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-19-879276-X | page = 955}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word cistron is used to emphasize that genes exhibit a specific behavior in a [[complementation test|cis-trans test]]; distinct positions (or [[locus (genetics)|loci]]) within a [[genome]] are '''cistronic'''.

== History ==
The words ''cistron'' and ''gene'' were coined before the advancing state of [[biology]] made it clear that the concepts they refer to are practically equivalent. The same historical naming practices are responsible for many of the [[synonym]]s in the life sciences.

The term cistron was coined by [[Seymour Benzer]] in an article entitled ''The elementary units of heredity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Benzer S | date = 1957 | chapter = The elementary units of heredity | title = The Chemical Basis of Heredity | veditors =  McElroy WD, Glass B | pages = 70–93 | publisher = Johns Hopkins Press | location = Baltimore, Maryland }} also reprinted in {{cite book | vauthors = Benzer S | date = 1965 | chapter = The elementary units of heredity | title = Selected papers on Molecular Genetics | veditors = Taylor JH | pages = 451–477 | publisher = Academic Press | location = New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cistron was defined by an operational test applicable to most organisms that is sometimes referred to as a cis-trans test, but more often as a [[complementation test]].

== Definition ==
For example, suppose a [[mutation]] at a chromosome position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is responsible for a change in [[recessive trait]] in a [[diploid]] organism (where chromosomes come in pairs). We say that the mutation is recessive because the organism will exhibit the [[wild type]] [[phenotype]] (ordinary trait) unless both chromosomes of a pair have the mutation ([[homozygous]] mutation). Similarly, suppose a mutation at another position, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, is responsible for the same recessive trait. The positions &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are said to be within the same cistron when an organism that has the mutation at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; on one chromosome and has the mutation at position &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; on the paired chromosome exhibits the recessive trait even though the organism is not homozygous for either mutation. When instead the wild type trait is expressed, the positions are said to belong to distinct cistrons / genes. It's important to know that cistron localization has been studied for several years, and, depending of the organism, this gene can be found in different places. For example, the gene can be found in RNA phage and is related to the cistron coat in some particular organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hindley J, Staples DH, Billeter MA, Weissmann C | title = Location of the coat cistron on the RNA of phage Q-beta | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 1180–7 | date = November 1970 | pmid = 5274447 | jstor = 60432 | doi=10.1073/pnas.67.3.1180 | pmc=283334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of the organisms that have been study are Tobacco, grapevine.

For example, an [[operon]] is a stretch of DNA that is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] to create a contiguous segment of [[RNA]], but contains more than one cistron / gene. The operon is said to be polycistronic, whereas ordinary genes are said to be monocistronic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13460">In medicine and psychology, '''clinical significance''' is the practical importance of a treatment effect—whether it has a real genuine, palpable, noticeable effect on daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/Psy394Q/Research%20Design%20Class/Assigned%20Readings/Clinical%20Trials/Kazdin99.pdf| author= Alan E.

==Types of significance==
===Statistical significance===
{{main|statistical significance}}
Statistical significance is used in [[hypothesis testing]], whereby the [[null hypothesis]] (that there is no relationship between [[Dependent and independent variables|variables]]) is tested.&lt;ref name="Nursing Research"&gt;{{cite book |last=Polit |first=D. F. |last2=Beck |first2=C. T. |title=Nursing Research: Generating Evidence for Nursing Practice |edition=9th |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Wolters Klower/Lippincott Williams &amp;amp; Wilkins |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-60547-782-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[level of significance]] is selected (most commonly α = 0.05 or 0.01), which signifies the probability of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Nursing Research"/&gt;  If there is a significant difference between two groups at α = 0.05, it means that there is only a 5% probability of obtaining the observed results under the assumption that the difference is entirely due to chance (i.e., the null hypothesis is true); it gives no indication of the magnitude or clinical importance of the difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Haase R.F. |author2=Ellis M.V. |author3=Ladany N. | year = 1989 | title = Multiple Criteria for Evaluating the Magnitude of Experimental Effects | url = | journal = Journal of Counseling Psychology | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 511–516 | doi=10.1037/0022-0167.36.4.511}}&lt;/ref&gt; When statistically significant results are achieved, they favor rejection of the null hypothesis, but they do not prove that the null hypothesis is false.  Likewise, non-significant results do not prove that the null hypothesis is true; they also give no evidence of the truth or falsity of the hypothesis the researcher has generated.&lt;ref name="Nursing Research"/&gt;  Statistical significance relates only to the compatibility between observed data  and what would be expected under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.

===Practical significance===
{{main|effect size}}

In broad usage, the "practical clinical significance" answers the question, ''how effective'' is the intervention or treatment, or how much change does the treatment causes. In terms of testing clinical treatments, practical significance optimally yields quantified information about the importance of a finding, using metrics such as [[effect size]], [[number needed to treat]] (NNT), and [[preventive fraction]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shabbir|first1=SH|last2=Sanders|first2=AE|title=Clinical significance in dementia research: a review of the literature.|journal=American Journal of Alzheimer's Disease &amp; Other Dementias|date=September 2014|volume=29|issue=6|pages=492–7|pmid=24526758|doi=10.1177/1533317514522539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practical significance may also convey semi-quantitative, comparative, or feasibility assessments of utility.

Effect size is one type of practical significance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson, L. 2008"/&gt; It quantifies the extent to which a sample diverges from expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Vacha-Hasse, T., Nilsson, J.E., Reetz, ., Lance, T.S., &amp; Thompson, B. (2000). Reporting practices and APA editorial policies regarding statistical significance and effect size. Theory &amp; Psychology, 10, 413-425.&lt;/ref&gt; Effect size can provide important information about the results of a study, and are recommended for inclusion in addition to statistical significance.  Effect sizes have their own sources of bias, are subject to change based on population variability of the dependent variable, and tend to focus on group effects, not individual changes.&lt;ref name="Peterson, L. 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen, J. (1997). The earth is round (p.&amp;nbsp;05). The American Psychologist, 49 (12), 997-1003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wilkinson L., APA , Inference Statistical | year = 1999 | title = Statistical methods in psychology journals: Guidelines and explanations | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 594–604 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.8.594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although clinical significance and practical significance are often used synonymously, a more technical restrictive usage denotes this as erroneous.&lt;ref name="Peterson, L. 2008"&gt;Peterson, L. (2008). "Clinical" Significance: "Clinical" Significance and "Practical" Significance are NOT the Same Things. Online Submission, Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Southwest Educational Research Association (New Orleans, LA, Feb 7, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  This technical use within psychology and psychotherapy not only results from a carefully drawn precision and particularity of language, but it enables a shift in perspective from group effects to the specifics of change(s) within an individual.

===Specific usage===
In contrast, when used as a technical term within psychology and psychotherapy, clinical significance yields information on whether a treatment was effective enough to change a patient’s diagnostic label. In terms of clinical treatment studies, clinical significance answers the question "Is a treatment effective enough to cause the patient to be normal [with respect to the diagnostic criteria in question]?"

For example, a treatment might significantly change depressive symptoms (statistical significance), the change could be a large decrease in depressive symptoms (practical significance- effect size), and 40% of the patients no longer met the diagnostic criteria for depression (clinical significance). It is very possible to have a treatment that yields a significant difference and medium or large effect sizes, but does not move a patient from dysfunctional to functional.

Within psychology and psychotherapy, '''clinical significance''' was first proposed by Jacobson, Follette, and Revenstorf &lt;ref&gt;
Jacobson, N.S., Follette, W.C., and Revenstorf, D. (1984). Psychotherapy outcome research: Methods for reporting variability and evaluating clinical significance. Behavior Therapy, 15(4).&lt;/ref&gt; as a way to answer the question, is a therapy or treatment effective enough such that a client does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis? Jacobson and Truax later defined clinical significance as “the extent to which therapy moves someone outside the range of the dysfunctional population or within the range of the functional population.”&lt;ref name="Jacobson, N. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jacobson N. |author2=Truax P. | year = 1991 | title = Clinical significance: A statistical approach to defining meaningful change in psychotherapy research | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 12–19 | doi=10.1037/0022-006x.59.1.12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed two components of this index of change: the status of a patient or client after therapy has been completed, and “how much change has occurred during the course of therapy.” &lt;ref name="Jacobson, N. 1991"/&gt;

Clinical significance is also a consideration when interpreting the results of the [[psychological assessment]] of an individual. Frequently, there will be a difference of scores or subscores that is [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]], unlikely to have occurred purely by chance. However, not all of those statistically significant differences are clinically significant, in that they do not either explain existing information about the client, or provide useful direction for intervention. Differences that are small in magnitude typically lack practical relevance and are unlikely to be clinically significant. Differences that are common in the population are also unlikely to be clinically significant, because they may simply reflect a level of normal human variation. Additionally, clinicians look for information in the assessment data and the client's history that corroborates the relevance of the statistical difference, to establish the connection between performance on the specific test and the individual's more general functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Sattler JM (2008). Assessment of children: Cognitive foundations (5/e). San Diego: Sattler Publications. {{ISBN|978-0-9702671-6-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Assessing Adolescent and Adult Intelligence |last1=Kaufman |first1=Alan S. |last2=Lichtenberger |first2=Elizabeth |authorlink1=Alan S. Kaufman |edition=3rd |year=2006|publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken (NJ) |isbn=978-0-471-73553-3 |laysummary=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471735531.html |laydate=22 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation of clinical significance==
Just as there are many ways to calculate statistical significance and practical significance, there are a variety of ways to calculate clinical significance. Five common methods are the Jacobson-Truax method, the Gulliksen-Lord-Novick method, the Edwards-Nunnally method, the Hageman-Arrindell method, and hierarchical linear modeling.&lt;ref name="Peterson, L. 2008"/&gt;

===Jacobson-Truax===
Jacobson-Truax is common method of calculating clinical significance. It involves calculating a Reliability Change Index (RCI).&lt;ref name="Jacobson, N. 1991"/&gt; The RCI equals the difference between a participant’s pre-test and post-test scores, divided by the [[standard error]] of the difference. Cutoff scores are established for placing participants into one of four categories: recovered, improved, unchanged, or deteriorated, depending on the directionality of the RCI and whether the cutoff score was met.

===Gulliksen-Lord-Novick===
The Gulliksen-Lord-Novick method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hsu L. M. | year = 1999 | title = The comparison of three methods of identifying reliable and clinically significant client changes: commentary on Hageman and Arrindell | doi = 10.1016/S0005-7967(99)00033-9 | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 1195–1202 | pmid = 10596465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to Jacobson-Truax, except that it takes into account [[regression to the mean]]. This is done by subtracting the pre-test and post-test scores from a population mean, and dividing by the standard deviation of the population.&lt;ref name="Peterson, L. 2008"/&gt;

===Edwards-Nunnally===
The Edwards-Nunnally method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Speer D. C. |author2=Greenbaum P. E. | year = 1995 | title = Five methods for computing significant individual client change and improvement rates: Support for an individual growth curve approach | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 1044–1048 | doi=10.1037/0022-006x.63.6.1044}}&lt;/ref&gt; of calculating clinical significance is a more stringent alternative to the Jacobson-Truax method.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Peterson, L. (2008). "Clinical" Significance: "Clinical" Significance and "Practical" Significance are NOT the Same Things. Online Submission, Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Southwest Educational Research.&lt;/ref&gt; Reliability scores are used to bring the pre-test scores closer to the mean, and then a confidence interval is developed for this adjusted pre-test score. Confidence intervals are used when calculating the change from pre-test to post-test, so greater actual change in scores is necessary to show clinical significance, compared to the Jacobson-Truax method.

===Hageman-Arrindell===
The Hageman-Arrindell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hageman W. J. |author2=Arrindell W. A. | year = 1999 | title = Establishing clinically significant change: increment of precision and the distinction between individual and group level of analysis | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 1169–1193 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7967(99)00032-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; calculation of clinical significance involves indices of group change and of individual change. The reliability of change indicates whether a patient has improved, stayed the same, or deteriorated. A second index, the clinical significance of change, indicates four categories similar to those used by Jacobson-Truax: deteriorated, not reliably changed, improved but not recovered, and recovered.

===Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM)===
{{main|Hierarchical linear modeling}}
HLM involves growth curve analysis instead of pre-test post-test comparisons, so three data points are needed from each patient, instead of only two data points (pre-test and post-test).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A computer program, such as Hierarchical Linear and Nonlinear Modeling&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssicentral.com/hlm/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; is used to calculate change estimates for each participant. HLM also allows for analysis of growth curve models of dyads and groups.

[[File:Clipping 1KHz 10V DIV clip A 5ohms-1-.jpg|thumb|400px|The altered peaks and troughs of the [[sine wave]] form displayed on this [[oscilloscope]] indicate the signal has been "clipped."]]

'''Clipping''' is a form of [[waveform]] [[Distortion#Audio distortion|distortion]] that occurs when an [[amplifier]] is overdriven and attempts to deliver an output voltage or current beyond its maximum capability. Driving an amplifier into clipping may cause it to output power in excess of its [[power rating]].

== Overview ==
When an amplifier is pushed to create a signal with more power than its power supply can produce, it will amplify the signal only up to its maximum capacity, at which point the signal can be amplified no further.  As the signal simply "cuts" or "clips" at the maximum capacity of the amplifier, the signal is said to be "clipping". The extra signal which is beyond the capability of the amplifier is simply cut off, resulting in a [[sine wave]] becoming a distorted [[Square wave|square-wave]]-type waveform.

Amplifiers have voltage, current and thermal limits. Clipping may occur due to limitations in the power supply or the output stage. Some amplifiers are able to deliver [[Audio power|peak power]] without clipping for short durations before energy stored in the power supply is depleted or the amplifier begins to overheat.

== Effects ==
[[File:Clipping 1dB.png|thumb|right|Difference between clipped and maximum unclipped waveforms]]

The higher frequency harmonics generated by an amplifier operating in clipping can damage a connected [[loudspeaker]]. This additional high frequency energy has the potential to damage a [[tweeter]] via overheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/audio/clipping/page1.html |author=Jim Lesurf |title=Clipping tweeter damage |access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.prosoundweb.com/topics/education/why_should_we_care_about_power_amplifier_clipping/ |title=Why Should We Care About Power Amplifier Clipping? |author=Chuck McGregor |date=2017-08-24 |access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many amplifier designers have incorporated circuits to prevent clipping. The simplest circuits act like a fast [[limiter]], which engages about one decibel before the clipping point. A more complex circuit, called "soft-clip", has been used from the 1980s onward to limit the signal at the input stage. The soft-clip feature begins to engage prior to clipping, for instance starting at 10&amp;nbsp;dB below maximum output power. The output waveform retains a rounded characteristic even in the presence of an overload input signal as much as 10&amp;nbsp;dB higher than maximum specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5UPyE6dcWgC&amp;pg=PA79 |pages=79–80 |title=High Performance Audio Power Amplifiers |last=Duncan |first=Ben |publisher=Newnes |date=1996 |isbn=9780080508047}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDfKSh3Q8kAC&amp;pg=PA278 |page=278 |title=Audio Engineering: Know It All |last=Duncan |first=Ben |chapter=Interfacing and Processing |editor=Douglas Self |editor2=Ben Duncan |editor3=Ian Sinclair |editor4=Richard Brice |editor5=John Linsley Hood |editor6=Andrew Singmin |editor7=Don Davis |editor8=Eugene Patronis |editor9=John Watkinson |publisher=Newnes |series=Know It All |volume=1 |date=2009 |isbn=9780080949642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital clipping ==
[[File:Clipping.svg|thumb|right|This [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] waveform is clipped between the red lines]]
In [[digital signal processing]], clipping occurs when the signal is restricted by the range of a chosen representation. For example, in a system using 16-bit [[signed-digit representation|signed]] integers, 32767 is the largest positive value that can be represented. If, during processing, the amplitude of the signal is doubled, [[sample (signal)|sample]] values of, for instance, 32000 should become 64000, but instead cause an [[integer overflow]] and [[Saturation arithmetic|saturate]] to the maximum, 32767. Clipping is preferable to the alternative in digital systems—wrapping—which occurs if the digital processor is allowed to overflow, ignoring the [[most significant bit]]s of the magnitude, and sometimes even the sign of the sample value, resulting in gross distortion of the signal.

== Avoiding clipping ==
The simplest way to avoid clipping is to reduce the signal level. Alternatively the system can be improved to support higher signal level without clipping. A [[limiter]] can be used to dynamically bring the levels of the loud parts of a signal down (for example, [[bass drum|bass]] and [[snare drum]]s).

Clipping can occur within a system as processing (e.g. a [[all-pass filter]]) can change the phase relationship between spectral components of a signal in such a way as to create excessive peak outputs. The excessive peaks may become clipped even though the system can play any simple sine wave signals of the same level without clipping. As such, some audiophiles will use amplifiers that are rated for power outputs over twice the speaker's ratings.

== Repairing a clipped signal ==
It is preferable to avoid clipping, but if a recording has clipped, and cannot be re-recorded, repair is an option. The goal of repair is to make up a plausible replacement for the clipped part of the signal.

Complex hard-clipped signals cannot be restored to their original state because the information contained in the peaks that are clipped is completely lost. Soft-clipped signals can be restored to their original state to within a case-dependent tolerance because no part of the original signal is completely lost. In this case, the degree of information loss is proportional to the degree of compression caused by the clipping. Lightly clipped bandwidth-limited signals that are highly oversampled have the potential for perfect repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Donoho|first=David L.|author2=Philip B. Stark|date=June 1989|title=Uncertainty principles and signal recovery|journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics|publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|volume=49|issue=3|pages=906–931|issn=0036-1399|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=64952|doi=10.1137/0149053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods can partially restore a clipped signal. Once the clipped portion is known, one can attempt partial recovery. One such method is [[interpolation]] or [[extrapolation]] of known samples. Advanced implementations may use [[cubic splines]] to attempt to restore a [[continuously differentiable]] signal. While these reconstructions are only an approximation of the original, the subjective quality may be improved. Other methods include copying the signal directly from one stereo channel to another, as it may be the case that only one channel is clipped.

Several software solutions of varying results and methods exist to repair clipping: CuteStudio Declip, Sony [[Sound Forge]], [[iZotope]] Rx3, [[Adobe Audition]], [[Nero Wave Editor]], declipping solutions from CEDAR Audio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cedar-audio.com/products/cambridge/camdeclip2.shtml |title=Declip |publisher=CEDAR Audio |access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Audacity (audio editor)|Audacity]] plugins such as Clip Fix.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

== Sources ==
In [[analog signal|analog]] audio equipment, there are several causes of clipping:
# The peak-to-peak of a solid-state transformerless amplifier (most [[integrated circuit]] and discrete [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] circuits) is limited to the [[power supply]] voltage less a small amount that depends on the design of the circuit (especially the driver configuration) and the saturation voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;ce(sat)&lt;/sub&gt; for [[bipolar transistors]], or R&lt;sub&gt;ds(on)&lt;/sub&gt; for [[FET|Field Effect Transistor]]s), and further reduced if the [[Operational amplifier#Output stage|output stage]] does not have a quiescent DC output voltage set to half the supply voltage. For example, with a typical [[opamp|operational amplifier]] the [[Absolute Maximum Rating]] for the supply voltage is 36 volts, and a safe operating design supply voltage is 30 volts; if this was supplied as a perfectly balanced +15V and -15V then the theoretical peak output for an ideal [[rail-to-rail output]] opamp would be 15 Volts peak (10.6V [[Root mean square|RMS]], 30V peak-to-peak), but a real-world opamp such as the 741 is likely to only be able to drive about 10 volts peak into loads above 2 kilohms, i.e. about 7.1V RMS).
# An amplifier may have an asymmetrical output swing, perhaps because a transistor is biased so its collector voltage is not half the supply voltage (or the "balanced" [[power supply]] rails aren't perfectly balanced); clipping may begin earlier on one half of the output waveform. [[Bootstrapping (electronics)|Bootstrapping]] or a redesign of the circuit may alleviate this when it is caused by difficulties in driving [[emitter follower]] [[Operational amplifier#Output stage|output stage]]s.
# If the [[power supply]] capacitor is no longer able to keep the voltage "flat" due to a massive current draw, the positive and negative voltage supply of the amplifier will fluctuate resulting in sort of a clipped signal that contains some AC line frequency harmonics.
# A [[vacuum tube]] can only move a limited number of [[electrons]] in an amount of time, dependent on its size, temperature, and metals. Usually fall-off in amplification with increasing output current results in "soft clipping".
# Amplifying devices may also have limits on their inputs, for example the maximum base current a [[bipolar transistor]] can take, and a [[vacuum tube]] may have problems with grid current if the input signal becomes too positive.  These factors can distort (clip) the input signal, if it comes from a high enough [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] source, or destroy the device (and so the designer will probably employ other limiting circuits; see below).
# A transformer (most commonly used between stages in tube equipment) will clip when its [[ferromagnetic]] core becomes electromagnetically [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturated]].
# An amplifier can limit the current output, or the input voltage, for a variety of reasons both intentional or not.  Intentional limiting circuits would not be expected to come into effect in normal operation, but when the output load [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] is too low or the system is connected to an exceptionally high signal level, for example. The result of this form of clipping might not create a flat top to the Voltage waveform, but rather a flat top to the current waveform. 
# Certain signal processing elements can produce a unique form of phase-inverted clipping when the input signal exceeds the common-mode input range of an opamp.  The result is that the voltage waveform clips, but in the wrong direction.

Many [[electric guitar]] [[Guitarist|players]] intentionally overdrive their [[guitar amplifier]]s to cause clipping and other [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] in order to get a desired sound. 

Some [[audiophiles]] {{Who|date=July 2009}}  believe that the clipping behavior of [[vacuum tube]]s (especially when used with little or no [[negative feedback]]) is superior to that of [[transistors]], in that vacuum tubes clip more gradually than transistors, resulting in harmonic distortion that is generally less objectionable.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  This gradual onset of clipping is known as [[gain compression]] or "soft clipping".  Circuits can be designed using either tubes or transistors to achieve this effect, and the behavior can be simulated with digital processing.

==Detection==
Clipping in a circuit can be detected by comparing the original input signal with an output signal  that has been adjusted for changes in applied gain. For instance, if a circuit has 10&amp;nbsp;dB of applied gain, it can be tested for clipping by attenuating the output signal's gain by 10&amp;nbsp;dB and comparing it to the input signal. If the circuit is driven into clipping, the attenuated output signal will show less voltage in the comparison. The electrical offset between the two signals can be used to illuminate clipping detection indicators, such as a red [[LED]], and can be used to decrease the gain of a preceding circuit so that the level of clipping distortion can be limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|5430409}} "Amplifier clipping distortion indicator with adjustable supply dependence"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conservation''' is an [[ethic]] of resource use, allocation, and protection. Its primary focus is upon maintaining the health of the [[Natural environment|natural world]], its [[fishery|fisheries]], [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]], and [[biological diversity]]. Secondary focus is on material conservation, including [[non-renewable resources]] such as metals, minerals and [[fossil fuels]], and [[energy conservation]], which is important to protect the natural world. Those who follow the conservation ethic and, especially, those who advocate or work toward conservation goals are termed [[Conservation movement|conservationists]].

The terms ''conservation'' and ''preservation'' are frequently conflated outside the academic, scientific, and professional kinds of literature. The US National Park Service offers the following explanation of the important ways in which these two terms represent very different conceptions of environmental protection ethics:

″Conservation and preservation are closely linked and may indeed seem to mean the same thing. Both terms involve a degree of protection, but how that protection is carried out is the key difference. Conservation is generally associated with the protection of natural resources, while preservation is associated with the protection of buildings, objects, and landscapes. Put simply, ''conservation seeks the proper use of nature, while preservation seeks protection of nature from use''.

During the [[environmentalism|environmental movement]] of the early 20th century, two opposing factions emerged: conservationists and preservationists. Conservationists sought to regulate human use while preservationists sought to eliminate human impact altogether.″&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/klgo/learn/education/classrooms/conservation-vs-preservation.htm National Park Service: Conservation versus preservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
To [[habitat conservation|conserve habitat]] in [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s and to stop [[deforestation]] is a goal widely shared by many groups with a wide variety of motivations.

To protect sea life from [[extinction]] due to [[overfishing]] or [[climate change]] is another commonly stated goal of conservation – ensuring that "some will be available for future generations" to continue a way of life.

The consumer conservation ethic is sometimes expressed by the ''four R's'': " Rethink, Reduce, Recycle, Repair"
This social ethic primarily relates to [[local purchasing]], [[moral purchasing]], the [[sustainability|sustained]], and efficient use of [[renewable resource]]s, the moderation of destructive use of finite resources, and the prevention of harm to common resources such as [[air pollution|air]] and [[water pollution|water]] quality, the natural functions of a living earth, and cultural values in a [[built environment]].

The principal value underlying most expressions of the conservation ethic is that the natural world has intrinsic and intangible worth along with utilitarian value – a view carried forward by the scientific [[conservation movement]] and some of the older [[Romanticism|Romantic]] schools of [[ecology movement]].

More [[utilitarian ethics|Utilitarian]] schools of conservation seek a proper valuation of [[Human impact on the environment|local and global impacts of human activity]] upon nature in their effect upon human [[measuring well-being|well being]], now and to posterity. How such values are assessed and exchanged among people determines the social, political, and personal restraints and imperatives by which conservation is practiced. This is a view common in the modern [[environmental movement]].

These movements have diverged but they have deep and common roots in the [[conservation movement]].

In the United States of America, the year 1864 saw the publication of two books which laid the foundation for Romantic and Utilitarian conservation traditions in America. The posthumous publication of [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden]]'' established the grandeur of unspoiled nature as a citadel to nourish the spirit of man. From [[George Perkins Marsh]] a very different book, ''[[Man and Nature]]'', later subtitled "The Earth as Modified by Human Action", catalogued his observations of man exhausting and altering the land from which his sustenance derives.

== Terminology ==
{{quote box

Memphis, TN, October 4, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;
|width=25%
|align=right}}

In common usage, the term refers to the activity of systematically protecting natural resources such as forests, including biological diversity. [[Carl F. Jordan]] defines the term as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jordan |first=Carl|title=Replacing Quantity With Quality As a Goal for Global Management|publisher=Wiley |date=1995|isbn=0-471-59515-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|biological '''conservation''' as being a philosophy of managing the environment in a manner that does not despoil, exhaust or extinguish.}}

While this usage is not new, the idea of biological conservation has been applied to the principles of ecology, [[bio geography]], [[anthropology]], economy and sociology to maintain  [[biodiversity]].

The term "conservation" itself may cover the concepts such as [[cultural diversity]], [[genetic diversity]] and the concept of movements [[environmental conservation]], [[seedbank]] (preservation of seeds). These are often summarized as the priority to [[respect diversity]], especially by [[Green movement|Greens]].

Much recent movement in conservation can be considered a resistance to [[commercialism]] and [[globalization]]. [[Slow Food]] is a consequence of rejecting these as moral priorities, and embracing a [[voluntary simplicity|slower and more locally focused lifestyle]].

== Practice ==
[[File:Daintree Rainforest.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The [[Daintree Rainforest]] in [[Queensland]], Australia]]

Distinct trends exist regarding conservation development. While many countries' efforts to preserve [[species]] and their [[habitats]] have been government-led, those in the North Western Europe tended to arise out of the middle-class and aristocratic interest in [[natural history]], expressed at the level of the individual and the national, regional or local [[learned society]]. Thus countries like Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, etc. had what we would today term [[NGOs]] – in the shape of the [[RSPB]], [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and County Naturalists' Trusts (dating back to 1889, 1895 and 1912 respectively) Natuurmonumenten, Provincial Conservation Trusts for each Dutch province, Vogelbescherming, etc. – a long time before there were [[national parks]] and [[national nature reserve]]s. This in part reflects the absence of wilderness areas in heavily cultivated Europe, as well as a longstanding interest in [[laissez-faire]] government in some countries, like the UK, leaving it as no coincidence that [[John Muir]], the Scottish-born founder of the National Park movement (and hence of government-sponsored conservation) did his sterling work in the USA, where he was the motor force behind the establishment of such NPs as [[Yosemite]] and [[Yellowstone]]. Nowadays, officially more than 10 percent of the world is legally protected in some way or the other, and in practice, private fundraising is insufficient to pay for the effective management of so much land with protective status.

Protected areas in developing countries, where probably as many as 70–80 percent of the species of the world live, still enjoy very little effective management and protection. Some countries, such as Mexico, have non-profit civil organizations and landowners dedicated to protecting vast private property, such is the case of Hacienda Chichen's Maya Jungle Reserve and Bird Refuge&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haciendachichen.com/eco-design.htm Haciendachichen.com], "The Importance of Eco-Design"&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Chichen Itza]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]. The Adopt A Ranger Foundation has calculated that worldwide about 140,000 rangers are needed for the protected areas in developing and transition countries. There are no data on how many rangers are employed at the moment, but probably less than half the protected areas in developing and transition countries have any rangers at all and those that have them are at least 50% short This means that there would be a worldwide ranger deficit of 105,000 rangers in the developing and transition countries.

One of the world's foremost conservationists, Dr.Kenton Miller, stated about the importance of Rangers: "The future of our [[ecosystem services]] and our heritage depends upon park rangers. With the rapidity at which the challenges to protected areas are both changing and increasing, there has never been more of a need for well-prepared human capacity to manage. Park rangers are the backbone of park management. They are on the ground. They work on the front line with scientists, visitors, and members of local communities."

Adopt A Ranger,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adopt-a-ranger.org Adopt-a-ranger.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703033240/http://www.adopt-a-ranger.org/ |date=3 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fears that the ranger deficit is the greatest single limiting factor in effectively conserving nature in 75% of the world. Currently, no conservation organization or western country or international organization addresses this problem. Adopt A Ranger has been incorporated to draw worldwide public attention to the most urgent problem that conservation is facing in developing and transition countries: protected areas without field staff. Very specifically, it will contribute to solving the problem by fundraising to finance rangers in the field. It will also help governments in developing and transition countries to assess realistic staffing needs and staffing strategies.

Others, including [[Survival International]], have advocated instead for cooperation with local tribal peoples, who are natural allies of the conservation movement and can provide cost-effective protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivalinternational.org/conservation Tribal Conservationists]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7545">The Council for Educational Technology&lt;ref&gt;This text is a summary of a more detailed description here http://www.edtechhistory.org.uk/organisations/cet.html&lt;/ref&gt; (originally called the National '''Council for Educational Technology''' (NCET) but reformed as the Council for Educational Technology (CET) in 1972) was set up in 1967 by the Department of Education and Science in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1967/apr/20/national-council-for-educational&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially it consisted of a large council of experts with a small administrative team whose purpose was to "advise educational services and industrial training organisations on the use of audio visual aids and media" but it quickly became more than this, developing projects, producing an academic journal BJET and advising government on setting up major computer aided learning programmes ([[National Development Programme in Computer Aided Learning|NDPCAL]] and [[Microelectronics Education Programme|MEP]]).  It was amalgamated with the [[Microelectronics Education Support Unit]] (MESU) in 1989 to form the [[National Council for Educational Technology]] (NCET which later was renamed the British Educational and Communication Technology Agency ([[Becta]]) in 1997).

==Formation==
The original Council (NCET) consisted of a Chairman appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Science after consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland, 31 members appointed by the former and 4 members appointed by the latter. In addition, assessors from eight government departments and educational bodies attended meetings. In 1973, as a result of the recommendations of the Hudson Working Party&lt;ref&gt;Central Arrangements for promoting Educational Technology in the United Kingdom, HMSO, 1972),&lt;/ref&gt; the Council was a representative body, consisting of 59 people.&lt;ref&gt;http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directors==

===Professor Tony Becher 1967-1969 ===
Tony Becher was the first Director appointed&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard G., 1980, The Business of Educational Development, British Journal of Educational Technology, 11-3 p156&lt;/ref&gt; from the Nuffield Foundation&lt;ref&gt;"Educational Technology Two", Education + Training, Vol. 10 Iss 12 pp. 481 - 481&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geoffrey Hubbard 1969-1986 ===
Geoffrey Hubbard  was appointed as Director  in June 1969. He was previously an engineer and then a civil servant at the Ministry of Technology.  He successfully steered the Council through its sometimes difficult relationship with government.  He retired in 1986 but continued his role as Chairman of the [[National Extension College]].

===Richard Fothergill 1987-1988 ===
Richard Fothergill was appointed Director following his role as Director of the Microelectronics Education Programme.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/nov/15/guardianobituaries.obituaries&lt;/ref&gt;

==The British Journal of Educational Technology ==
The British Journal of Educational Technology (BJET) was sponsored and funded by the Council.  It published its first issue in January 1970 and  Professor Norman Mackenzie was its first editor and the prime mover behind its creation.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard G., 1980, The Business of Educational Development, British Journal of Educational Technology, 11-3 p156&lt;/ref&gt; Although sponsored by the Council it always kept a strong, peer-reviewed, academic approach to its work - as it said in its "Auspices" at the front of each volume.

''Whilst the British Journal of Educational Technology is supported by the Council for Educational Technology for the United Kingdom, it nevertheless reflects an independent, and not official view, of developments or opinions on educational technology.''

BJET continued through the decades and is now published by Blackwell and continues to publish academic articles on educational technology. Importantly its back numbers chronicle much of the history of educational technology in the UK and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-8535&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developing NDPCAL==
During the late 1960s computers were beginning to make an impact on education and John Duke, the Council's newly appointed assistant Director proposed a major initiative in computer-based learning.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper R., 1977, Editorial Introduction, British Journal of Educational Technology, 8-3 p164&lt;/ref&gt; The Council set up a Working Party to investigate the potential role of the computer and to outline a programme of research and development.  Following a feasibility study the Council set out the case for a 5-year programme in 'computer-based learning' in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edtechhistory.org.uk/history/the_1960s/orig_NCET.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Government, following much discussion amongst the interested departments and an intervening general election, announced the approval of Mrs Thatcher, Secretary of State for Education and Science to a '[[National Development Programme in Computer Aided Learning]]' in a DES press release dated 23 May 1972.

==Developing MEP==
During the late 1970s, with the rapid rise in the use of microelectronics, the Prime Minister Jim Callaghan, is reported to have asked each government department to draw up an action plan to meet the challenge of new technologies and the DES asked CET to create plans for a new programme - the [[Microelectronics Education Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;Fothergill (1988) Implications of New Technology for the School Curriculum (London, Kogan Page)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Programme was aimed at primary and secondary schools in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Although it was delayed by the change of government in 1979, Keith Joseph as Education Secretary finally approved it in 1980 and in March a four-year programme for schools, costing £9 million.

==Publications==
As well as BJET CET published a range of publications, many the result of projects it set up and funded.  The following is a selection of these publications to give a flavour of the breadth and range of the Council's activity:
* 1972 Educational Technology: The Development, Application and Evaluation of Systems, Techniques and Aids to Improve the Process of Human Learning
* 1974 Copyright and education: a guide to the use of copyright material in educational institutions

The [[dynamical systems]] approach to [[neuroscience]] is a branch of [[mathematical biology]] that utilizes [[nonlinear dynamics]] to understand and model the [[nervous system]] and its functions. In a dynamical system, all possible states are expressed by a [[phase space]]. Such systems can experience [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcation]] (a qualitative change in behavior) as a function of its bifurcation parameters and often exhibit [[Randomness|chaos]]. '''Dynamical neuroscience''' describes the non-linear dynamics at many levels of the brain from single neural cells&lt;ref&gt;Izhikevich, E. ''Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience: The Geometry of Excitability and Bursting''. Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[cognition|cognitive processes]], [[sleep]] states and the behavior of neurons in large-scale neuronal simulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://neuro.dgimeetings.com/Agenda.aspx Agenda of the Dynamical Neuroscience XVIII: The resting brain: not at rest!]&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurons have been modeled as nonlinear systems for decades now, but dynamical systems emerge in numerous other ways in the nervous system.  From chemistry, chemical species models like the Gray–Scott model exhibit rich, chaotic dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Wackerbauer R. and Showalter K. (2003) Collapse of Spatiotemporal Chaos. Phys. Rev.

==History==

One of the first well-known incidences in which neurons were modeled on a mathematical and physical basis was the [[integrate-and-fire]] model developed in 1907. Decades later, the discovery of the [[squid giant axon]] eventually led [[Alan Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] (half-brother to [[Aldous Huxley]]) to develop the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] of the neuron in 1952. This model was simplified with the [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/FitzHugh-Nagumo_model Izhikevich E. and FitzHugh R. (2006), Scholarpedia, 1(9):1349]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1981, the [[Morris–Lecar model]] had been developed for the barnacle muscle.

These mathematical models proved useful and are still used by the field of [[biophysics]] today, but a late 20th century development propelled the dynamical study of neurons even further: computer technology. The largest issue with physiological equations like the ones developed above is that they were [[nonlinear]]. This made the standard analysis impossible and any advanced kinds of analysis included a number of (nearly) endless possibilities. Computers opened a lot of doors for all of the hard sciences in terms of their ability to approximate solutions to nonlinear equations. This is the aspect of computational neuroscience that dynamical systems encompasses.

In 2007, a canonical text book was written by Eugene Izhikivech called ''Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience'', assisting the transformation of an obscure research topic into a line of academic study.

==Neuron dynamics==
(intro needed here)

===Electrophysiology of the neuron===
{{main|biological neuron model}}

The motivation for a dynamical approach to neuroscience stems from an interest in the physical complexity of neuron behavior.  As an example, consider the coupled interaction between a neuron's [[membrane potential]] and the activation of [[ion channel]]s throughout the neuron. As the membrane potential of a neuron increases sufficiently, channels in the membrane open up to allow more ions in or out. The ion flux further altars the membrane potential, which further effects the activation of the ion channels, which affects the membrane potential, and so on. This is often the nature of coupled nonlinear equations. A nearly straight forward example of this is the Morris–Lecar model:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
C {dV \over dt} &amp; = g_{Ca} M_{ss} (V-V_Ca) - g_K N (V-V_K) - g_L(V-V_L) + I_\text{app} \\[6pt]
{dN \over dt} &amp; = {{N_{ss} - N} \over {\tau_N}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

See the Morris–Lecar paper&lt;ref&gt;Morris, C. and Lecar, H. (1981) "Voltage oscillations in the barnacle giant muscle fiber". ''Biophys. J.'' 35: 193–213. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1327511/pdf/biophysj00242-0188.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; for a in-depth understanding of the model. A more brief summary of the Morris Lecar model is given by Scholarpedia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Morris-Lecar_model Lecar, H. (2007), Scholarpedia, 2(10):1333]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this article, the point is to demonstrate the physiological basis of dynamical neuron models, so this discussion will only cover the two variables of the equation:
*&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; represents the membrane's current potential
*&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the so-called "recovery variable", which gives us the probability that a particular potassium channel is open to allow ion conduction.

Most importantly, the first equation states that the change of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; with respect to time depends on both &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, as does the change in &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; with respect to time. &lt;math&gt;M_{ss}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_{ss}&lt;/math&gt; are both functions of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. So we have two coupled functions, &lt;math&gt;g(V,N)&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;g(V,N)&lt;/math&gt;.

Different types of neuron models utilize different channels, depending on the physiology of the organism involved. For instance, the simplified two-dimensional Hodgkins–Huxley model considers sodium channels, while the Morris–Lecar model considers calcium channels.  Both models consider potassium and leak current. Note, however, that the Hodgkins–Huxley model is canonically four-dimensional.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgkin, A. and Huxley, A. (1952): A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve. J. Physiol. 117:500–544. {{PMID|12991237}} [http://jp.physoc.org/content/117/4/500.full.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excitability of neurons===

One of the predominant themes in classical neurobiology is the concept of a digital component to neurons. This concept was quickly absorbed by computer scientists where it evolved into the simple weighting function for coupled [[artificial neural network]]s. Neurobiologists call the critical voltage at which neurons fire a threshold. The dynamical criticism of this digital concept is that neurons don't truly exhibit all-or-none firing and should instead be thought of as resonators.&lt;ref&gt;Izhikevich, E. ''Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience: The Geometry of Excitability and Bursting''. Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In dynamical systems, this kind of property is known as excitability. An excitable system starts at some stable point. Imagine an empty lake at the top of a mountain with a ball in it. The ball is in a stable point. Gravity is pulling it down, so it's fixed at the lake bottom. If we give it a big enough push, it will pop out of the lake and roll down the side of the mountain, gaining momentum and going faster. Let's say we fashioned a loop-de-loop around the base of the mountain so that the ball will shoot up it and return to the lake (no rolling friction or air resistance). Now we have a system that stays in its rest state (the ball in the lake) until a perturbation knocks it out (rolling down the hill) but eventually returns to its rest state (back in the lake). In this example, gravity is the driving force and spatial dimensions x (horizontal) and y (vertical) are the variables. In the Morris Lecar neuron, the fundamental force is electromagnetic and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; are the new [[phase space]], but the dynamical picture is essentially the same. The electromagnetic force acts along &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; just as gravity acts along &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. The shape of the mountain and the loop-de-loop act to couple the y and x dimensions to each other. In the neuron, nature has already decided how &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; are coupled, but the relationship is much more complicated than the gravitational example.

This property of excitability is what gives neurons the ability to transmit information to each other, so it is important to dynamical neuron networks, but the Morris Lecar can also operate in another parameter regime where it exhibits oscillatory behavior, forever oscillating around in phase space. This behavior is comparable to pacemaker cells in the heart, that don't rely on excitability but may excite neurons that do.

==Global neurodynamics==
The global dynamics of a network of neurons depend on at least the first three of four attributes:
# individual neuron dynamics (primarily, their [[Action potential|thresholds]]&lt;!-- The link to "threshold" is (obviously) in need of disambiguation. --&gt; or [[excitability]])
# information transfer between neurons (generally either [[synapse]]s or [[gap junction]]s
# [[network topology]] 
# external forces (such as thermodynamic gradients)

There are many combinations of neural networks that can be modeled between the choices of these four attributes that can result in a versatile array of global dynamics.

===Biological neural network modeling===

Biological neural networks can be modeled by choosing an appropriate [[biological neuron model]] to describe the physiology of the organism and appropriate coupling terms to describe the physical interactions between neurons (forming the network).  Other global considerations must be taken into consideration, such as the initial conditions and parameters of each neuron.

In terms of nonlinear dynamics, this requires evolving the state of the system through the functions.  Following from the Morris Lecar example, the alterations to the equation would be:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
C {dV_i \over dt} &amp; = g_{Ca} M_{ss} (V_i-V_{Ca}) - g_K N_i (V_i-V_K) - g_L(V_i-V_L) + I_\text{app} + D(V_i) \\[6pt]
{dN_i \over dt} &amp; = {{N_{ss} - N_i} \over {\tau_N}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; now has the subscript &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, indicating that it is the ith neuron in the network and a coupling function has been added to the first equation.  The coupling function, ''D'', is chosen based on the particular network being modeled.  The two major candidates are [[synapse|synaptic]] junctions and [[gap junction|gap]] junctions.

====Attractor network====

*Point attractors – memory, pattern completion, categorizing, noise reduction
*Line attractors – neural integration: [[oculomotor control]]
*Ring attractors – neural integration: spacial orientation
*Plane attractors – neural integration: (higher dimension of oculomotor control)
*Cyclic attractors – [[central pattern generator]]s
*Chaotic attractors – recognition of odors and chaos is often mistaken for random noise.

Please see Scholarpedia's page for a formal review of attractor networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Attractor_network Eliasmith, C. (2007), Scholarpedia, 2(10):1380]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond neurons==
While neurons play a lead role in brain dynamics, it is becoming more clear to neuroscientists that neuron behavior is highly dependent on their environment. But the environment is not a simple background, and there is a lot happening right outside of the neuron membrane, in the extracellular space. Neurons share this space with [[glial cell]]s and the extracellular space itself may contain several agents of interaction with the neurons.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlem, Y. A., Dahlem, M. A., Mair, T., Braun, K. &amp; Muller, S. C. (2003) Extracellular potassium alters frequency and profile of retinal spreading depression waves. Exp. Brain Res. 152, 221–228. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/uhfewxgdfrvjg6w5]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glia===
Glia, once considered a mere support system for neurons, have been found to serve a significant role in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Ullian, E., Christopherson, K. and Barres, B. (2004) Role for Glia in Synaptogenesis.  GLIA 46:209–216. [http://www.phy.duke.edu/research/chempatt/ResearchDocs/pdfs/glia47_3_2005_2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keyser, D. and Pellmar, T. (1994) Synaptic transmission in the hippocampus: critical role for clial cells. GLIA 10:237–243. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/109701158/abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of how the interaction between neuron and glia have an influence on neuron excitability is a question of dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Nadkarni, S. (2005) Dynamics of Dressed Neurons: Modeling the Neural-Glial Circuit and Exploring its Normal and Pathological Implications. Doctoral dissertation. Ohio University, Ohio. [http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi/Nadkarni%20Suhita.pdf?ohiou1125689320]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurochemistry===
Like any other [[Cell (biology)|cell]], neurons operate on an undoubtedly complex set of molecular reactions.  Each cell is a tiny community of molecular machinery ([[organelle]]s) working in tandem and encased in a lipid membrane.  These organelles communicate largely via chemicals like [[G-protein]]s and [[neurotransmitter]]s, consuming [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] for energy.  Such chemical complexity is of interest to physiological studies of the neuron.

====Neuromodulation====
:Neurons in the brain live in an extracellular fluid, capable of propagating both chemical and physical energy alike through reaction-diffusion and bond manipulation that leads to thermal gradients. Volume transmission has been associated with thermal gradients caused by biological reactions in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Fuxe, K., Rivera, A., Jacobsen, K., Hoistad, M., Leo, G., Horvath, T., Stained, W., De la calle, A. and Agnati, L. (2005) Dynamics of volume transmission in the brain.  Focus on catecholamine and opioid peptide communication and the role of uncoupling protein 2. Journal of Neural Transmission, 112:1. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/08f4rkf094lp6w9v/]&lt;/ref&gt;  Such complex transmission has been associated with migraines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scilogs.eu/en/blog/gray-matters/2009-11-25/migraine_and_chaos Dahlem, M. (2009) Migraine and Chaos. SciLogs, 25 November]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive neuroscience==
The computational approaches to [[theoretical neuroscience]] often employ artificial neural networks that simplify the dynamics of single neurons in favor of examining more global dynamics.  While neural networks are often associated with [[artificial intelligence]], they have also been productive in the cognitive sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Gluck, M. 2001. Gateway to Memory: An Introduction to Neural Network Modeling of the Hippocampus and Learning. Massachusetts: MIT. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FSKCwgITcCIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Gluck%20neural%20network%20hippocampus&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  Artificial neural networks use simple neuron models, but their global dynamics are capable of exhibiting both Hopfield and Attractor-like network dynamics.

===Hopfield network===
The [[Lyapunov function]] is a nonlinear technique used to analyze the stability of the zero solutions of a system of differential equations.  Hopfield networks were specifically designed such that their underlying dynamics could be described by the Lyapunov function.  Stability in biological systems is called [[homeostasis]].  Particularly of interest to the cognitive sciences, Hopfield networks have been implicated in the role of associative memory (memory triggered by cues).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hopfield_network Hopfield, J. (2007), Scholarpedia, 2(5):1977]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elena Ramírez Parra''' (born 1972) is a Spanish botanist who won a [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science]] in 2010. She studies the negative effects that produce [[environmental stress]] (drought, salinity of the soil, excess radiation, presence of [[heavy metals]] and the high and low temperatures). Her goal is to improve harvests.

==Life==
Ramírez studied biological sciences at the [[Autonomous University of Madrid]] and a doctorate in [[molecular biology]] from the same university (2000).

She became a senior researcher at the Centre for Plant Biotechnology and Genomics (Centro de Biotecnología y Genómica de Plantas, CBGP) of the National Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA) and the [[Technical University of Madrid]] (UPM), studying the negative effects that produce environmental stress in plants.&lt;ref name=cbgp&gt;{{cite web|title=GENETIC AND MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF CROP NATURAL VARIATION IN FRUIT QUALITY TRAITS |url=http://www.cbgp.upm.es/en/analisis_natural.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her investigation characterises the mechanisms that plants use to respond to external stresses like drought, soil salinity, heavy metals and extreme temperatures. She tries to create a generation of new varieties that will improve harvests.&lt;ref name="lo"&gt;[http://www.culturabiotec.com/2011/02/prada/ La investigación “se viste de Prada”], 2011, culturabiotec.com, Retrieved 13 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of her career, she has published many scientific articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elena_Ramirez-Parra|title=Elena Ramirez-Parra - Dr. - Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria, Madrid - INIA - CBGP- Centre of Biotechnology and Genomics in Plants|last2=|first2=|date=|website=ResearchGate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbgp /&gt;

In November 2010, she was awarded, with four scientists ([[Isabel Lastres Becker]], [[Ana Briones Alonso]], [[Mercedes Vila]] and [[María Antonia Herrero]]), the [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science]]. This endowment of €15000 is to reward the work of women scientists younger than 40.&lt;ref name="lo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pais"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/sociedad/2010/11/18/actualidad/1290034810_850215.html|title=Cinco científicas de la vida españolas reciben las becas L'Oréal-Unesco|first=|last=M.R.E|date=18 November 2010|publisher=|via=elpais.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sharav.gif|thumb|250px|Sharav Sluice Energy Tower]]

The '''energy tower''' is a device for producing [[electric power|electrical power]]. The brainchild of Dr. Phillip Carlson,{{Ref|Carlson}} expanded by Professor Dan Zaslavsky and Dr. Rami Guetta from the [[Technion]].{{Ref|ET-brochure}} Energy towers spray water on hot air at the top of the tower, making the cooled air fall through the tower and drive a turbine at the tower's bottom.

== Concept ==

An energy tower (also known as a downdraft energy tower, because the air flows down the tower) is a tall (1,000 meters) and wide (400 meters) hollow cylinder with a water spray system at the top. Pumps lift the water to the top of the tower and then spray the water inside the tower. Evaporation of water cools the hot, dry air hovering at the top. The cooled air, now denser than the outside warmer air, falls through the cylinder, spinning a turbine at the bottom. The turbine drives a generator which produces the electricity.

The greater the temperature difference between the air and water, the greater the energy efficiency. Therefore, downdraft energy towers should work best in a hot dry climate. Energy towers require large quantities of water. Salt water is acceptable, although care must be taken to prevent corrosion, so that [[desalination]] is an example to solve this problem.

The energy that is extracted from the air is ultimately derived from the sun, so this can be considered a form of [[solar power]]. Energy production continues at [[night]], because air retains some of the day's heat after dark. However, power generation by the energy tower is affected by the [[weather]]: it slows down each time the [[Surroundings (thermodynamics)|ambient]] [[humidity]] increases (such as during a [[rain]]storm), or the [[temperature]] falls.

A related approach is the [[solar updraft tower]], which heats air in glass enclosures at ground level and sends the heated air up a tower driving turbines at the base. Updraft towers do not pump water, which increases their efficiency, but do require large amounts of land for the collectors. Land acquisition and collector construction costs for updraft towers must be compared to pumping infrastructure costs for downdraft collectors. Operationally, maintaining the collector structures for updraft towers must be compared to pumping costs and pump infrastructure maintenance.

== Cost/efficiency ==

Zaslavsky and other authors estimate that depending on the site and financing costs, energy could be produced in the range of 1-4 cents per kWh, well below alternative energy sources other than hydro. Pumping the water requires about 50% of the turbine's output. Zaslavsky claims that the Energy Tower would achieve up to 70-80% {{Ref|PhysicaPlus}} of the [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot limit]]. If the conversion efficiency turns out to be much lower, it is expected to have an adverse impact on projections made for cost of energy.

Projections made by Altmann{{Ref|Altmann}} and by Czisch{{Ref|Czisch}}{{Ref|Czisch_slides}} about conversion efficiency and about cost of energy (cents/kWh) are based only on model calculations{{Ref|Gutman}}, no data on a working pilot plant have ever been collected.

Actual measurements on the 50&amp;nbsp;kW [[Manzanares, Ciudad Real|Manzanares]] pilot solar updraft tower found a conversion efficiency of 0.53%, although [[Schlaich Bergermann &amp; Partner|SBP]] believe that this could be increased to 1.3% in a large and improved 100&amp;nbsp;MW unit.{{Ref|Mills}} This amounts to about 10% of the theoretical limit for the [[Carnot cycle#The Carnot cycle 2|Carnot cycle]]. It is important to note a significant difference between the up-draft and down-draft proposals. The usage of water as a working-medium dramatically increases the potential for thermal energy capture, and electrical generation, due to its specific heat capacity. While the design may have its problems (see next section) and the stated efficiency claims has yet to be demonstrated, it would be an error to extrapolate performance from one to the other simply because of similarities in the name.

== Potential problems ==

* In salty humid air corrosion rates can be very high. This concerns the tower and the turbines.{{Ref|Zwirn}}
* The technology requires a hot and arid climate. Such locations include the coast of [[West Africa]], [[Western Australia]], northern [[Chile]], [[Namibia]], the [[Red Sea]], [[Persian Gulf]], and the [[Gulf of California]]. Most of these regions are remote and thinly populated, and would require power to be [[HVDC|transported over long distances]] to where it is needed. Alternatively, such plants could provide captive power for nearby industrial uses such as [[desalination plant]]s, [[aluminium production]] via the [[Hall-Héroult process]], or to generate [[hydrogen]] for [[ammonia production]].
* Humidity as a result of plant operation may be an issue for nearby communities. A 400 meter diameter powerplant producing wind velocity of 22 meters per second, must add about 15 grams of water per kilogram of air processed. This is equal to 41 tons of water per second.&lt;ref&gt;Pluvinergy&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of humid air, this is 10 cubic kilometers of very humid air each hour. Thus, a community even 100 kilometers away may be unpleasantly affected.  
* Brine is a problem in proportion to the humidity created, since water's vapor pressure decreases with salinity, it is reasonable to expect at least as much brine as water in humidity. This means that a river of brine flows away from the powerplant at 41 tons (m3s-1) per second, along with a river of saline water flowing in with 82 tons of water per second (m3s-1).

Large industrial consumers often locate near cheap sources of electricity. However, many of these desert regions also lack necessary [[infrastructure]], increasing capital requirements and overall risk.

== Demonstration project ==

In 2014 Maryland-based Solar Wind Energy, Inc. proposed to build a {{convert|685|m}} tower. Wind speeds were expected to reach {{convert|80|kph}}. The company claims that a tower near [[San Luis, Arizona]] would produce up to 1,250 MW on sunny days and a yearly average of 435 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.solarwindenergytower.com/the-tower.html | title=About the Tower | accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company claims to have entitlements for a San Luis site and financing agreement (with JDF Capital Inc.) for up to US$1,585,000.{{ref|Giz1406}}

[[Image:Falsevacuum.svg|thumb|240px|A [[scalar field]] ''φ'' in a false vacuum. Note that the energy ''E'' is higher than that in the true vacuum or [[ground state]], but there is a barrier preventing the field from classically rolling down to the true vacuum. Therefore, the transition to the true vacuum must be stimulated by the creation of [[particle physics|high-energy particle]]s or through [[quantum tunnelling|quantum-mechanical tunneling]].]]

In [[quantum field theory]], a '''false vacuum''' is a hypothetical [[vacuum state|vacuum]] that is somewhat, but not entirely, stable. It may last for a very long time in that state, and might eventually move to a more stable state. The most common suggestion of how such a change might happen is called [[False vacuum#Bubble nucleation|bubble nucleation]] - if a small region of the universe by chance reached a more stable vacuum, this 'bubble' would spread. 

A false vacuum may only exist at a [[maxima and minima|local minimum]] of [[energy]] and is therefore not stable, in contrast to a true vacuum, which exists at a global minimum and is stable. A false vacuum may be very long-lived, or [[metastability|metastable]].

== True vs false vacuum ==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}

A [[ground state|vacuum]] or vacuum state is defined as a space with as little energy in it as possible. Despite the name the vacuum state still has quantum fields.  A true vacuum is a global minimum of energy, and coincides with a local vacuum.  This configuration is stable.

It is possible that the process of removing the largest amount of energy and particles possible from a normal space results in a different configuration of quantum fields with a [[maxima and minima|local minimum]] of energy.  This local minimum is called a "false vacuum". In this case, there would be a barrier to entering the true vacuum. Perhaps the barrier is so high that it has never yet been overcome anywhere in the universe.

A false vacuum is unstable due to the [[quantum tunnelling]] of [[instanton|instantons]] to lower energy states. Tunnelling can be caused by quantum fluctuations or the creation of [[particle physics|high-energy particles]]. The false vacuum is a [[maxima and minima|local minimum]], but not the lowest energy state.

== Standard Model vacuum ==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}

If the [[Standard Model]] is correct, the [[elementary particle|particles]] and [[fundamental force|forces]] we observe in our universe exist as they do because of underlying [[quantum field]]s. Quantum fields can have states of differing stability, including 'stable', 'unstable', or '[[metastability|metastable]]' (meaning very long-lived but not completely stable). If a more stable vacuum state were able to arise, then existing particles and forces would no longer arise as they do in the universe's present state. Different particles or forces would arise from (and be shaped by) whatever new quantum states arose. The world we know depends upon these particles and forces, so if this happened, everything around us, from [[subatomic particle]]s to [[galaxy|galaxies]], and all [[fundamental forces]], would be reconstituted into new fundamental particles and forces and structures. The universe would lose all of its present structures and become inhabited by new ones (depending upon the exact states involved) based upon the same quantum fields.

== Stability and instability of the vacuum ==

The outer dotted line is the current measurement uncertainties; the inner ones show predicted sizes after completion of future physics programs, but their location could be anywhere inside the outer.&lt;ref name="Alekhin 2012" /&gt;]]

Many scientific models of the universe have included the possibility that it exists as a [[metastability|long-lived, but not completely stable]], sector of space, which could potentially at some time be destroyed upon 'toppling' into a more stable vacuum state.&lt;ref name="turnerwilczek"&gt;

"So in principle it could happen tomorrow, but then most likely in a very distant galaxy, so we are still safe for billions of years before it gets to us."
&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 paper published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', as part of their investigation into [[global catastrophic risk]]s, MIT physicist [[Max Tegmark]] and Oxford philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] calculate the natural risks of the destruction of the Earth at less than 1 per [[gigayear]] from all events, including a transition to a lower vacuum state. They argue that due to [[Anthropic principle|observer selection effects]], we might underestimate the chances of being destroyed by vacuum decay because any information about this event would reach us only at the instant when we too were destroyed. This is in contrast to events like risks from impacts, [[gamma-ray bursts]], [[supernova]]e and [[hypernovae]], whose frequencies we have adequate direct measures of.&lt;ref name="tegmarkbostrom"&gt;

If measurements of these particles suggests that our universe lies within a false vacuum of this kind, then it would imply—more than likely in many billions of years&lt;ref name="Boyle"&gt;{{cite news |last=Boyle |first=Alan |title=Will our universe end in a 'big slurp'?

The article quotes [[Fermilab]]'s Joseph Lykken: "[T]he parameters for our universe, including the Higgs [and top quark's masses] suggest that we're just at the edge of stability, in a "metastable" state. Physicists have been contemplating such a possibility for more than 30 years. Back in 1982, physicists Michael Turner and Frank Wilczek wrote in Nature that "without warning, a bubble of true vacuum could nucleate somewhere in the universe and move outwards..."&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The bubble's effects would be expected to propagate across the universe at the speed of light from wherever it occurred. However space is vast—with even [[Andromeda galaxy|the nearest galaxy]] being over 2 million [[light-year]]s from us, and others being many billions of light-years distant, so the effect of such an event would be unlikely to arise here for billions of years after first occurring.&lt;ref name="Peralta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyle" /&gt;|group=Note}}—that it could cease to exist as we know it, if a true vacuum happened to [[Nucleation|nucleate]].&lt;ref name="Boyle" /&gt;

In a study posted on the [[arXiv]] in March 2015,&lt;ref name="BurdaGregory2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burda|first1=Philipp|last2=Gregory|first2=Ruth|last3=Moss|first3=Ian G.|title=Vacuum metastability with black holes|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|volume=2015|issue=8|year=2015|issn=1029-8479|doi=10.1007/JHEP08(2015)114|arxiv=1503.07331|bibcode=2015JHEP...08..114B}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was pointed out that the vacuum decay rate could be vastly increased in the vicinity of black holes, which would serve as a nucleation seed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/could-black-holes-destroy-the-universe-de8a3135856f]&lt;/ref&gt; According to this study a potentially catastrophic vacuum decay could be triggered any time by [[primordial black hole]]s, should they exist. If particle collisions produce mini black holes then energetic collisions such as the ones produced in the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) could trigger such a vacuum decay event. However the authors say that this is not a reason to expect the universe to collapse, because if such mini black holes can be created in collisions, they would also be created in the much more energetic collisions of cosmic radiation particles with planetary surfaces. And if there are primordial mini black holes they should have triggered the vacuum decay long ago. Rather, they see their calculations as evidence that there must be something else preventing vacuum decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cho|first1=Adrian|title=Tiny black holes could trigger collapse of universe—except that they don't|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/08/tiny-black-holes-could-trigger-collapse-universe-except-they-dont|website=Sciencemag.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inflation====
It would also have implications for other aspects of physics, and would suggest that the Higgs [[coupling (physics)|self-coupling]] λ and its β&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; function could be very close to zero at the Planck scale, with "intriguing" implications, including for theories of gravity and Higgs-based inflation.&lt;ref name="Alekhin 2012" /&gt;{{rp|218}} A future electron-positron collider would be able to provide the precise measurements of the top quark needed for such calculations.&lt;ref name="Alekhin 2012" /&gt;

{{Further|Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider#Critics of high energy experiments|Safety of particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider}}

Vacuum decay would be theoretically possible if our universe had a false vacuum in the first place, an issue that was highly theoretical and far from resolved in 1982.&lt;ref name="turnerwilczek"/&gt; If this were the case, a bubble of lower-energy vacuum could come to exist by chance or otherwise in our universe, and [[catalysis|catalyze]] the conversion of our universe to a lower energy state in a volume expanding at nearly the speed of light, destroying all of the [[observable universe]] without forewarning.&lt;ref name="colemandeluccia" /&gt; [[Eternal inflation|Chaotic Inflation Theory]] suggests that the universe may be in either a false vacuum or a true vacuum state.

A paper by Coleman and de Luccia which attempted to include simple gravitational assumptions into these theories noted that if this was an accurate representation of nature, then the resulting universe "inside the bubble" in such a case would appear to be extremely unstable and would almost immediately collapse:&lt;ref name="colemandeluccia" /&gt;

{{Quote box|In general, gravitation makes the probability of vacuum decay smaller; in the extreme case of very small energy-density difference, it can even stabilize the false vacuum, preventing vacuum decay altogether. We believe we understand this. For the vacuum to decay, it must be possible to build a bubble of total energy zero. In the absence of gravitation, this is no problem, no matter how small the energy-density difference; all one has to do is make the bubble big enough, and the volume/surface ratio will do the job. In the presence of gravitation, though, the negative energy density of the true vacuum distorts geometry within the bubble with the result that, for a small enough energy density, there is no bubble with a big enough volume/surface ratio. Within the bubble, the effects of gravitation are more dramatic. The geometry of space-time within the bubble is that of [[anti-de Sitter space]], a space much like conventional [[de Sitter space]] except that its group of symmetries is O(3, 2) rather than O(4, 1). Although this space-time is free of singularities, it is unstable under small perturbations, and inevitably suffers gravitational collapse of the same sort as the end state of a contracting [[Friedmann universe]]. The time required for the collapse of the interior universe is on the order of ... microseconds or less.

The possibility that we are living in a false vacuum has never been a cheering one to contemplate. Vacuum decay is the ultimate ecological catastrophe; in the new vacuum there are new constants of nature; after vacuum decay, not only is life as we know it impossible, so is chemistry as we know it. However, one could always draw [[stoicism|stoic]] comfort from the possibility that perhaps in the course of time the new vacuum would sustain, if not life as we know it, at least some structures capable of knowing joy. This possibility has now been eliminated.

The second special case is decay into a space of vanishing cosmological constant, the case that applies if we are now living in the debris of a false vacuum which decayed at some early cosmic epoch. This case presents us with less interesting physics and with fewer occasions for rhetorical excess than the preceding one. It is now the interior of the bubble that is ordinary [[Minkowski space]]...|source = [[Sidney Coleman]] and Frank De Luccia|align = center}}

Such an event would be one possible [[global catastrophic risk|doomsday event]]. It was used as a [[plot device]] in a science-fiction story in 1988 by [[Geoffrey A. Landis]],&lt;ref name="landis"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Geoffrey A. Landis | title=Vacuum States| journal=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction | date=1988 | pages= July}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2000 by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]],&lt;ref name="Baxter"&gt;{{cite book | author=Stephen Baxter | title=Time | date=2000 | isbn=0-7653-1238-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002 by [[Greg Egan (author)|Greg Egan]] in his novel ''[[Schild's Ladder]]'', and in 2015 by [[Alastair Reynolds]] in his novel ''[[Poseidon's Wake]]''.

In theory, either high enough energy concentrations or random chance could trigger the tunneling needed to set this event in motion. However an immense number of [[Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray|ultra-high energy particles]] and events have occurred in the history of our universe, dwarfing by many orders of magnitude any events at human disposal. Hut and Rees&lt;ref name="hutrees"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=P. Hut |author2=M.J. Rees | title=How stable is our vacuum?| journal=Nature | date=1983 | pages= 508–509 | issue=5908 | volume=302 | doi=10.1038/302508a0|bibcode = 1983Natur.302..508H }}&lt;/ref&gt; note that, because we have observed [[cosmic ray|cosmic ray collisions]] at much higher energies than those produced in terrestrial particle accelerators, these experiments should not, at least for the foreseeable future, pose a threat to our current vacuum. Particle accelerators have reached energies of only approximately eight [[Tera-|tera]] [[electron volts]] (8×10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; eV). Cosmic ray collisions have been observed at and beyond energies of 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; [[Electronvolt|eV]], a million times more powerful&amp;nbsp;– the so-called [[Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit]] – and other cosmic events may be more powerful yet. Against this, John Leslie has argued&lt;ref name="leslie"&gt;{{cite book | author=John Leslie| title=The End of the World:The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction | publisher=Routledge | date=1998| isbn=0-415-14043-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that if present trends continue, particle accelerators will exceed the energy given off in naturally occurring cosmic ray collisions by the year 2150. Fears of this kind were raised by critics of both the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] and the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at the time of their respective proposal, and determined to be unfounded by scientific inquiry.

==Bubble nucleation==&lt;!-- [[Bubble nucleation]] redirects here --&gt;
In the theoretical physics of the false vacuum, the system moves to a lower energy state&amp;nbsp;– either the true vacuum, or another, lower energy vacuum&amp;nbsp;– through a process known as bubble [[nucleation]].&lt;ref name="M. Stone 1976 3568–3573"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P.H. Frampton 1976 1378–1380"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Therefore, the interior of the bubble has a lower energy. The walls of the bubble (or [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain wall]]s) have a [[surface tension]], as energy is expended as the fields roll over the potential barrier to the lower energy vacuum. The most likely size of the bubble is determined in the semi-classical approximation to be such that the bubble has zero total change in the energy: the decrease in energy by the true vacuum in the interior is compensated by the tension of the walls.

[[Joseph Lykken]] has said that study of the exact properties of the [[Higgs boson]] could shed light on the possibility of vacuum collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21499765 "Cosmos may be 'inherently unstable'."]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion of bubble===

Any increase in size of the bubble will decrease its potential energy, as the energy of the wall increases as the surface area of a sphere &lt;math&gt;4 \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt; but the negative contribution of the interior increases more quickly, as the volume of a sphere &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, after the bubble is nucleated, it quickly begins expanding at very nearly the speed of light. The excess energy contributes to the very large kinetic energy of the walls. If two bubbles are nucleated and they eventually collide, it is thought that particle production would occur where the walls collide.

The tunnelling rate is increased by increasing the energy difference between the two vacua and decreased by increasing the height or width of the barrier.

==Gravitational effects==

The addition of [[gravity]] to the story leads to a considerably richer variety of phenomena. The key insight is that a false vacuum with positive potential energy density is a [[De Sitter universe#No ordinary matter but a positive cosmological constant|de Sitter vacuum]], in which the potential energy acts as a [[cosmological constant]] and the [[Universe]] is undergoing the exponential expansion of [[de Sitter space]]. This leads to a number of interesting effects, first studied by [[Sidney Coleman|Coleman]] and de Luccia.&lt;ref name="colemandeluccia"/&gt;

===Development of theories===

[[Alan Guth]], in his original proposal for [[cosmic inflation]],&lt;ref name="guth"&gt;{{cite journal|author=A. H. Guth |authorlink=Alan Guth |title=The Inflationary Universe: A Possible Solution to the Horizon and Flatness Problems |url=http://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.23.347 |journal=[[Physical Review]] |oclc=4433735058 |volume=D23 |pages=347–356 |date=1981-01-15 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.23.347 |bibcode=1981PhRvD..23..347G}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that inflation could end through quantum mechanical bubble nucleation of the sort described [[False vacuum#Gravitational effects|above]]. See [[Chaotic inflation theory#History|History of Chaotic inflation theory]]. It was soon understood that a homogeneous and isotropic universe could not be preserved through the violent tunneling process. This led [[Andrei Linde]]&lt;ref name="linde"&gt;{{cite journal|author=A. Linde|title=A New Inflationary Universe Scenario: A Possible Solution Of The Horizon, Flatness, Homogeneity, Isotropy And Primordial Monopole Problems|journal=Phys. Lett.|volume=B108|page=389|date=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, independently, Andreas Albrecht and [[Paul Steinhardt]],&lt;ref name="albrechtsteinhardt"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Albrecht |author2=P. J.

Fenton's reagent can be used to destroy [[organic compound]]s such as [[trichloroethylene]] (TCE) and [[tetrachloroethylene]] (perchloroethylene, PCE). It was developed in the 1890s by [[Henry John Horstman Fenton]] as an analytical reagent.&lt;ref name="Fenton1894"&gt;{{cite journal

== Overview ==
Iron(II) is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to [[iron(III)]], forming a [[hydroxyl radical]] and a [[hydroxide ion]] in the process. Iron(III) is then reduced back to iron(II) by another molecule of hydrogen peroxide, forming a [[hydroperoxyl]] radical and a [[hydrogen atom|proton]]. The net effect is a [[disproportionation]] of hydrogen peroxide to create two different oxygen-radical species, with water ({{math|size=100%|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}}) as a byproduct.

{{NumBlk|:| Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + HO• + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
{{NumBlk|:| Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + HOO• + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

The [[free radical]]s generated by this process then engage in secondary reactions. For example, the hydroxyl is a powerful, non-selective oxidant. Oxidation of an organic compound by Fenton's reagent is rapid and [[exothermic]] and results in the oxidation of contaminants to primarily carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref&gt;http://geocleanse.com/fentonsreagent.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Reaction ({{EquationNote|1}}) was suggested by [[Fritz Haber|Haber]] and Weiss in the 1930s as part of what would become the [[Haber–Weiss reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Haber, F.  |author2=Weiss, J. | year = 1932 | title = Über die Katalyse des Hydroperoxydes | journal = [[Naturwissenschaften]] | doi = 10.1007/BF0150471|volume = 20|issue = 51|pages = 948–950}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iron(II) sulfate]] is typically used as the iron catalyst. The exact mechanisms of the redox cycle are uncertain, and non-OH• oxidizing mechanisms of organic compounds have also been suggested.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Therefore, it may be appropriate to broadly discuss ''Fenton chemistry'' rather than a specific ''Fenton reaction''.

In the electro-Fenton process, hydrogen peroxide is produced ''in situ'' from the [[electrochemical reduction]] of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Juan Casado |author2=Jordi Fornaguera |author3=Maria I. Galan |title=Mineralization of Aromatics in Water by Sunlight-Assisted Electro-Fenton Technology in a Pilot Reactor  |journal=Environ. Sci. Technol. |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=1843–47 |date=January 2005 |pmid= 15819245|doi= 10.1021/es0498787|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/esthag/2005/39/i06/abs/es0498787.html|bibcode=2005EnST...39.1843C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenton's reagent is also used in [[organic synthesis]] for the [[hydroxylation]] of [[arene]]s in a [[radical substitution]] reaction such as the classical conversion of [[benzene]] into [[phenol]].

{{NumBlk|:| C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

A recent hydroxylation example involves the [[organic oxidation|oxidation]] of [[barbituric acid]] to [[alloxane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brömme HJ, Mörke W, Peschke E |title=Transformation of barbituric acid into alloxan by hydroxyl radicals: interaction with melatonin and with other hydroxyl radical scavengers |journal=J.

As an example [[Tert-Butanol|''tert''-butanol]] is dimerized with Fenton's reagent and [[sulfuric acid]] to 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-hexanediol.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | collvol = 5  |  collvolpages = 1026 | prep = cv5p1026 | title =  α,α,α',α'-Tetramethyltetramethylene  glycol | author = E.

==Biomedical applications==
The Fenton reaction has importance in biology because it involves the creation of free radicals by chemicals that are present in vivo. Transition-metal ions such as iron and copper donate or accept free electrons via intracellular reactions and help in creating free radicals. Most intracellular iron is in [[ferric]] (+3 ion) form and must be reduced to the [[ferrous]] (+2) form to take part in Fenton reaction. Superoxide ions and transition metals act in a synergistic manner in the creation of free radical damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robbins|author2=Cotran|last-author-amp=yes|title=Pathologic Basis of Disease|edition=7th|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780808923022|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, although the clinical significance is still unclear, it is one of the viable reason to avoid iron supplementation in patients with active infections, whereas other reasons include iron-mediated infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapointe|first=Marc|date=2004-01-01|title=Iron supplementation in the intensive care unit: when, how much, and by what route?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/cc2825|journal=Critical Care|volume=8|issue=2|pages=1–5|doi=10.1186/cc2825|issn=1364-8535|pmc=3226152|pmid=15196322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fernhurst Research Station''' was a [[Crop protection|plant protection]] ([[Herbicide|weed killer]]) research institute in [[West Sussex]], mainly run by ICI, for the [[Horticulture industry|fruit industry]].

==History==
[[Plant Protection Limited]] moved to this site in 1945 and opened a research institute on the estate of Sir [[Felix Schuster]] (1854-1936). The research institute was to investigate pest and disease control, and was also known as a horticultural research station. In June 1951 an international conference, with scientists from 39 countries, took place at the site on [[Famine|food scarcity]].&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 26 June 1951, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 May 1955, the site was visited by the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]]. Another international conference took place at the site in June 1956. 

ICI Plant Protection had its international headquarters at the site in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1986 a new international conference centre was opened on the site by the Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]]. ICI Public Health was formed in 1989 and situated at the site.

In April 1990, the site won a [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise|Queen's Award for Technological Achievement]] for herbicides, fungicides and pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'',Saturday  21 April 1990, page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zeneca===
It became part of [[Zeneca]] in 1994. 

===Syngenta===
It became part of [[Syngenta]]. It became the headquarters of Syngenta Europe Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04312779/filing-history?page=3 Companies House]&lt;/ref&gt; Syngenta left the site in December 2001. This site is mostly still present.

==Structure==
It was situated to the east of the [[A286 road|A286]], around a mile north of the east-west [[Serpent Trail]]. 

==Function==
It undertook [[Pesticide research|research]] on horticultural crops. It had a 60-acre orchard with 9 acres of [[plum]]s and 26 acres of [[Table apple|dessert apple]]s. Around 700 people worked at the site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3151">Formulated in 1862 by [[Lord Kelvin]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[William John Macquorn Rankine]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Thomson |first=William |year=1862 |title=On the Age of the Sun's Heat |url=https://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/on_the_age_of_the_suns_heat.html |journal=Macmillan's Magazine |volume=5 |pages=388–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''heat death paradox''', also known as '''Clausius's paradox''' and '''thermodynamic paradox''',&lt;ref name="Cucic2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cucić |first1=Dragoljub |last2=Angelopoulos |year=2010 |title=Paradoxes of Thermodynamics |journal=AIP Conference Proceedings |volume=1203 |pages=1267 |arxiv=0912.1756|doi=10.1063/1.3322352 |series=&lt;!--AIP Conference Proceedings--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' argument that uses [[thermodynamics]] to show the impossibility of an infinitely old universe.

{{quote|Assuming that the universe is eternal, a question arises: How is it that [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] has not already been achieved?&lt;ref name="Cucic2009b"&gt;{{cite arXiv
 | last1=Cucic | first1=Dragoljub A.
 | date=2008
 | title=Astrophysical Paradoxes, long version
 | eprint=0812.1679
 | class=physics.hist-ph
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This paradox is based upon the classical model of the universe in which the universe is eternal. Clausius's paradox is a paradox of paradigm. It was necessary to amend the fundamental ideas about the universe, which brought about the change of the paradigm. The paradox was solved when the paradigm was changed.

The paradox was based upon the rigid mechanical point of view of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] postulated by [[Rudolf Clausius]] according to which heat can only be transferred from a warmer to a colder object. If the universe was eternal, as claimed in the classical stationary model of the universe, it should already be cold.&lt;ref name="Cucic2009b"/&gt;

Any hot object transfers heat to its cooler surroundings, until everything is at the same [[temperature]]. For two objects at the same temperature as much [[heat flow]]s from one body as flows from the other, and the net effect is no change. If the universe were infinitely old, there must have been enough time for the stars to cool and warm their surroundings. Everywhere should therefore be at the same temperature and there should either be no stars, or everything should be as hot as stars.

Since there are [[star]]s and the universe is not in [[thermal equilibrium]] it cannot be infinitely old.

The paradox does not arise in [[Big Bang]] or [[Steady state theory|steady state]] cosmology. In Big Bang cosmology, the current age of the universe is not old enough to have reached equilibrium; while in a steady state system, sufficient hydrogen is replenished or regenerated continuously to allow for a constant average density and preventing stars from running down.

[[Anthropology]] is the study of various aspects of&amp;nbsp;[[human]]s&amp;nbsp;within past and present&amp;nbsp;[[Society|societies]].&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anthropology?q=anthropology|title=anthropology|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27505/anthropology|title=anthropology|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm|title=What is Anthropology?|publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]]|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study is practiced in multiple countries, each of whom has their own history of how anthropology has developed in their respective countries.

== Latin America ==
Anthropology in Latin America is a well established discipline that has existed for over 100 years. The countries that are summarized in this section include Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, the Andean region, Costa Rica, and Colombia. Latin America anthropologists established their discipline in conjunction with American and European anthropologists, and revised their disciplines to study cultural phenomena through their own perspectives, independent of American and European thought.   [[File:Map-Latin America and Caribbean.png|thumb|Latin America and the Caribbean]]

=== Andes ===

Andean anthropology’s roots began during the turn of the 20th century, containing social movements between two groups in Peru, and from academia within the United States. The mestizo (non-native) and indigenous intellectuals known as indigenistas competed for political and intellectual space and recognition in Peru. Indigenous intellectuals advocated for interculturalidad, where indigenous thought could occupy Peruvian society as its own entity and not become blended as a singular national identity that the mestizaje proposed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Anthropologies: Disciplinary Transformations within Systems of Power|last=Ribiero|first=Gustavo|last2=Escobar|first2=Arturo|publisher=Berg|others=Marisol de la Cadena|year=2006|isbn=9781845201913|location=New York, New York|pages=201–224|chapter=The Production of Other Knowledges and Its Tensions: From Andeanist Anthropology to Interculturalidad?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mestizaje perspective sought to modernize Peru and model their society similar to the United States. [[José María Arguedas]] was a writer and ethnographer in Peru, who classified himself as an indigenous intellectual that challenged Western thought and ideology. [[John Victor Murra]], an anthropologist teaching in the United States collaborated with Arguedas. Their collaboration stemmed from Murra’s travels in 1952 to the Latin American region when he was working under the anthropologist [[Sidney Mintz]] as a PhD student. Indigenistas were active in social and political movements in Latin America and collaborated with people inside of the United States, but still sought to be independent from Western thought.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Logo of the American Anthropological Association.png|thumb|AAA]]
In 1936, the [[American Anthropological Association]] initiated studies in Latin America on how to incorporate indigenous people in Latin American society, termed acculturation studies, and in 1935, the [[Social Science Research Council]], the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], and the Committee on Latin American studies worked to benefit the interests of the United States. The Peruvian government funded anthropological institutions beginning in the 1940s, and the establishment of the Instiuto de Etnologia y Arqueologia and a Peruvian sector in the Instituto Indigneista Interamericano followed. By the 1960s Peruvian governmental funding decreased, and became reliant upon the United States for funding. The indigenous incorporation into the goal of a singular society was termed cholification by the Peruvian sociologist [[Aníbal Quijano|Anibal Quijano]]. In the 1990s during the Neo-liberal era, indigenous thought became more recognized with political conflicts in the Andean region, and interculturalidad was pursued again for Andean states to recognize the diversity of the people that occupied them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Argentina ===
Social Anthropology was established in Argentina in 1957. It was first institutionalized at the University of [[Buenos Aires]]. Before the institutionalization of social anthropology, the discipline largely focused on historical studies. Rosana Guber attributes the introduction of social anthropology to [[Esther Hermitte]] who was a history professor at the Ethnographic Museum in Argentina. It was during her trips to the University of Chicago that she was introduced to social anthropology, and so it was the west who influenced the institutionalization of social anthropology in Argentina. In 1965, students began to ask for a discipline separate from sociology, and that was not focused primarily on indigenous people. There was a movement around this time that called for a greater understanding of the changes modern society was going through, especially during and after the 1966 [[Revolución Argentina]]. Later, in 1974, students and faculty within departments that were studying social movements and change suffered kidnappings and murders by the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance|Argentine AntiCommunist Alliance]]. The current status of Argentinian anthropology is still deeply rooted in western influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Committed or Scientific?

=== Brazil ===
[[File:Getulio Vargas (1930).jpg|thumb|Getúlio Vargas (1930)|234x234px]]
Anthropology in Brazil was institutionalized in 1930 at the beginning of the [[Vargas Era]]. Later during the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil was experiencing political authoritarianism. As a result, anthropology began to address inter-ethnic friction. In the 1970s anthropologists began to consider nearby urban studies as a topic of research. The 1980s kicked off a more modern type of anthropology where anthropologists began to look at themselves as “the other”. Brazil did not have an issue of [[alterity]] or exoticism, because it existed within its own borders. Brazil began to value exoticism and viewed it as the acknowledgement of cultural diversity according to [[:pt:Mariza Peirano|Mariza Peirano]]. In general, the overall current goal for Brazilian anthropology was to better the future for modernization by enlightening modern political elite and identifying relevant topics for investigation. Some of Brazil’s main anthropological institutions are the University of Brazil, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, and the Brazilian Association of Anthropology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Other People's Anthropologies: Ethnographic Practice on the Margins|last=Boskovic|first=Alexander|publisher=Berghahn Books|others=Mariza G.S. Peirano|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=186–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colombia ===
Anthropology in Colombia was institutionalized during the mid-1940s. Between the 1950s-70’s, Colombian anthropologists sought to integrate into national society and began to deal with terms like culture, integration, and assimilation. However, during the 1970s, this early understanding of anthropology was opposed and anthropologists began to confront terms such as national integration because they felt it was loaded with other issues like racial supremacy. Emerging social movements encouraged this new way of thinking because it recognized the rights of peasant and ethnic populations as well as the influence of Marxism. Anthropologists continued this way of thinking through the 1980s although a larger influence from militant anthropology became apparent. By militant anthropology, Myriam Jimeno refers to anthropologists who often debate and participate, but write very little. The goal of this type of anthropology was to alter the symbols of national identity and to accompany new ethnic movements in finding representation. Anthropologists and ethnic groups aimed to challenge the way indigenous groups were being ostracized by cultural hegemony. Later on in 1991, Colombia underwent a process of constitutional reform and development in attempt to recognize more cultural and ethnic rights. Some of its current most influential institutions are the [[Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History]], the Colombian National University, and the National Institute of Ethnology.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/165081955|title=A companion to Latin American anthropology|last=Poole|first=Deborah|date=2008|publisher=Blackwell Pub|others=Jimeno, Myriam|year=|isbn=0631234683|location=Malden, MA|pages=72–89|oclc=165081955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costa Rica ===
[[File:Margarita Bolaños.jpg|thumb|305x305px|Presidenta del Partido Acción Ciudadana 
'''Margarita Bolaños Arquín'''
]]
Costa Rican anthropology was institutionalized in 1967 under political influence. According to Margarita Bolaños Arquín, increasing notions of nationalism and anti imperialism led to the institutionalization of social sciences in Costa Rica. During the 1960s, around the time of institutionalization, social scientists' primary focus was on the birth and implications of social movements, as well as the consequences of modernization in rural areas. Later, French [[Structural Marxism]] influenced the social sciences to take an interest in the study of class structures. Over time, anthropology in Costa Rica was highly criticized in its struggle to find its identity. Caught in a sort of balancing act between western and Latin American practice, anthropology in Costa Rica eventually learned to take the criticisms of other anthropologies and made a name for itself with a focus on gender studies, identity studies, and developmental problems. To legitimize their discipline, anthropology contributed to other sciences such as linguistics, agriculture, and psychology. However, during the 1980s Costa Rica endured a recession, and anthropological institutions were under threat. During this time, [[globalization]] was becoming increasingly popular and while during the recession of the 1980s Costa Rica was not seen as a power player, at the start of the 1990s, the country could now participate in ways that were productive. It was not until around the 1990s that anthropologists regained the opportunity to research and, after such political and economic turmoil, there was much to question. Throughout the 1990s the focus of anthropology and other disciplines such as sociology continued to research in rural areas but shifted their research to the survival of the poor during tough economic times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolanos|first=Margarita|date=Fall 2002|title=Costa Rican Social Anthropology in the Central American Context at the End of the Twentieth Century|url=|journal=Practicing Anthropology|volume=24|pages=17–21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
[[Manuel Gamio]], the first Mexican anthropologist, earned his PhD in 1921, having studied under [[Franz Boas]]. The first anthropology department was established in 1938. Indigenous population studies known as indigenism, are an integral part of Mexican anthropology, and became popular during the presidency of [[Lázaro Cárdenas|Lázaro Cardenas]], serving from 1934-1940. The [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|National Institute of Anthropology and History]] was established by President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] in 1939, and remains a prominent place of anthropological study in Latin America. The nation-building interests of incorporating the indigenous population into the Mexican state also led to the establishment of the Inter-American Indian Institute in 1942, in Mexico City, along with the establishment of the academic journal, America Indígena. Marxist theory was predominantly used to analyze social phenomena, and was combined with social evolution theory that viewed Mexico in three historical time phases: pre-Hispanic, Colonial, and Modern.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:Lazaro cardenas2.jpg|thumb|President Lazaro Cardenas 
In office 1934-1940
]]
In the 1970s, [[Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán]], an anthropologist who was formerly a medical doctor worked for the federal government and promoted critical anthropology in Mexico that used Marxist theory and rejected imperialistic practices from the United States. Mexico’s urban populations began to increase in the 1970s, which became another topic of study for anthropologists. In the 1980s, Gramscian Marxism became the theoretical center, and studies included rural and urban populations, and labor. Institutions of anthropology have continued to increase since the 1980s, offering undergraduate and graduate degrees. Neo-liberal market transformations in the 1990s have affected anthropological training presently, as students may find careers not only in the universities, but non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Anthropologies: Disciplinary Transformations within Systems of Power|last=Ribeiro|first=Gustavo|last2=Escobar|first2=Arturo|publisher=Berg|others=Esteban Krotz|year=2006|isbn=9781845201913|location=New York, New York|pages=87–109|chapter=Mexican Anthropology's Ongoing Search for Identity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Asia ==
Asia includes the countries China, Japan, Philippines, and Siberia. Anthropology in Asia has been influenced by Western anthropological ideologies through colonial contact, historically. While the discipline of anthropology is historically built from nation-building and colonization from core countries, language and publishing barriers, funding opportunities and political status all influence the structure of anthropological research in each Asian country. Anthropology in the social and cultural perspective have not always had a strong tradition in Asian anthropology, but ethnography, ethnology, and folklore often have dominant roots within the discipline.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== China ===
[[File:Cai_Yuanpei_1.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cai_Yuanpei_1.jpg|thumb|Cai Yuanpei, the father of anthropology in China]]
[[China|Chinese]] anthropology was founded by scholar [[Cai Yuanpei]]. Cai Yuanpei was a scholar educated at the [[University of Leipzig]], and he brought both Western influence and standardization into the discipline of anthropology in China. The first department of anthropology was founded in 1928 with Cai Yuanpei’s creation of [[Academia Sinica]] in [[Beijing]]. At Academia Sinica, physical anthropology and archaeology held focus.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62324831|title=World anthropologies : disciplinary transformations within systems of power|last=Smart|first=Josephine|publisher=|others=Ribeiro, Gustavo Lins., Escobar, Arturo, 1951-|year=|isbn=9781845201913|location=Oxford, UK|pages=69–85|oclc=62324831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz Boas also brought Western influence to China, and British functionalism would make a lasting impact on Chinese anthropology. In addition to Cai Yuanpei, [[Wu Wenzao]] was one of the most influential proponents of Western-influenced anthropology, and he took classes under [[Ruth Benedict]] (one of Boas’ students that would be influential in the field of anthropology on her own overall).&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55146652|title=The making of anthropology in East and Southeast Asia|last=Liu|first=Xin|date=2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|others=Yamashita, Shinji., Bosco, Joseph, 1957-, Eades, J.

World War II pushed back the institutional development of anthropology in China until the late 1940s. With this revitalization, Chinese anthropologists began to look inwards at themselves for subjects of study. This inward focus led anthropologists of the time to attempt to use anthropology to better Chinese society.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; 1940-late 1950s was a time of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence in China, followed by 1957-1977 and [[Mao Zedong]]’s era of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;  During this time, Maoist aims supplemented ethnology and Chinese national identity creation.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Post-1978 was a time of reform in China following the end of Mao Zedong's leadership. Academia was reconstructed, and anthropology subsequently saw a revival during this time. Exchanges between foreign faculty and students helped to globalize Chinese anthropology and bring in other perspectives.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Liang Zhaotong was an advocate for the revival of social and cultural anthropology, but for this to happen, anthropology had to be seen as a useful tool for improvements in the field of the social sciences and society.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Anthropology was held in lower regard than ethnology in China due to the ideology of Mao Zedong, and anthropologists left anthropology for other disciplines in social science, such as sociology, which subsequently saw a large period of development in the 1980s. This lower regard for anthropology also caused the field to receive less attention and less funding from the public and Chinese institutions.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

The [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] (CASS) and the [[State Education Committee]] founded the Chinese Anthropological Association in 1981 (now part of the East Asian Anthropological Association). Today, anthropology in China is still influenced by its history of being less practical and less important in the field of social sciences. This causes a lack of public interest and awareness in Chinese anthropology in favor of more “professional” disciplines, such as medicine, business, law, etc.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Japan ===
[[File:Ryuzo_Torii_01.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ryuzo_Torii_01.jpg|thumb|Torii Ryuzo 1952]]
The creation of anthropology in [[Japan]] was a response to the research of [[Edward S. Morse|Edward Morse]], the first professor of Zoology at [[Tokyo Imperial University]], where he discovered signs of cannibalism in Japan.  Japanese nationalism motivated Japanese peoples to study themselves rather than being subjects of study by outsiders.  This motivation led to the formation of Anthropological Society of [[Tokyo]] in 1886.  Tsuboi Shôgorô was a leading member of this group, and he is named one of the founding fathers of Japanese anthropology.  In 1892, he became the first professor of anthropology at [[Tokyo Imperial University]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Making of Anthropology in East and Southeast Asia|last=Bosco|first=Joseph|last2=Eades|first2=J.S.|last3=Yamashita|first3=Shinji|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2004|isbn=1-57181-259-8|location=United States|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, the Japanese colonial empire was marked by the annexation of [[Taiwan]] and led to an increase in domestic ethnographers in this region.  [[Torii Ryūzō]] was Tsuboi's successor and greatly attributed data and photographs of Taiwan during this time period.  His own research abroad redirected peoples' focus from themselves, Japanese folklore-studies, to the colonial Others.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The expansion [[List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|Japanese imperialism]] drove [[Torii Ryūzō|Ryūzō]]'s research of others.  This shift in research subjects created a separate discipline, ethnology or 'race studies.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania|last=Shimizu|first=Akitoshi|last2=van Breman|first2=Jan|publisher=Curzon Press|year=1999|isbn=0-7007-0604-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Japanese Society of Ethnology (''Nihon Minzokugakkai'') was formed, which separated Japanese folklore and ethnological studies from comparative ethnology.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In 1968, the Eighth Congress of the [[International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences]] (IUAES) was held in Japan.

In 2004, in response to the IUAES, the Japanese Society of Ethnology changed its name to the Japanese Society of Cultural Anthropology; this is one of the largest organizations at 2,000 members.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Considered to be a semi-peripheral country in comparison to the West, Japan is home to the largest number of anthropologists in Asia as well as the largest center for anthropological research in Asia.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Japan's history resembles a colonial power in East Asia.  Currently, language and audience discrepancies hinder open conversations between Japanese and American anthropologies.  Since Western academic anthropologists publish in English, their local and global audience is essentially one.  In Japan, writing for a global audience requires publishing in English.  While Japanese scholars are knowledgeable about Western anthropological theories and trends, institutional factors deter Japanese anthropologists to publish in English;  a more extensive peer review process can delay publication approval for years resulting in outdated empirical data.  Japanese academics prefer to publish in university in-house journals where there is a much shorter delay in publication approval.  A local audience means publishing in Japanese and increasing the gap between world anthropologies.

=== Philippines ===
The movement of [[indigenization]] of anthropology in the [[Philippines]] challenges foreign-adopted Western concepts, theories and methods.  To understand the viewpoints of this process, indigenization can be examined as a historical process, a perspective of native concepts, and as both a problem and solution created by colonial or neocolonial educational curriculum.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Yamashita, Shinji, et al. “Towards Indigenization: Responses, Challenges, and Experiences in the Philippines.” ''The Making of Anthropology in East and Southeast Asia'', Berghahn Books, 2004, pp. 335–353.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1560-1898, the Philippines was under Spanish colonial regime.  During this time, Spanish colonizers established society through theologoical orthodoxy.  They valued their own written history over the Philippines' native traditions, and oral tradition was undermined by colonization.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

From 1898-1941, the second period of colonization by the United States took place.  Ethnographic knowledge was established as the basis of integration of indigenous elements into mainstream Philippine society.  In 1914, anthropology curriculum was established at the [[University of the Philippines]], and three years later, an anthropology department was created.  In 1921, the anthropology department at the University of Philippines merged with the sociology department.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

During the post-war era (1946-1968), student activism, national pride and identity reinforced the process of decolonization; the University of the Philippines was at the forefront of this movement. Filipino scholars increasingly pursued graduate programs in the United States anthropology departments.  This created an issue that will be discussed further.

From 1970-1986, social and political consciousness in the Philippines marked a revolutionary period.  The country adopted conflict models; Marxist ideology was more suitable for the Philippines that was in a crisis state.  In the late 1970s, the Philippine Folklore Society was formed.  This growth of folklore studies was due to the further development of indigenization in the Philippines.  In 1977, The Philippine Anthropological Society (Ugnayan ng Agham Tao or UGAT) was founded.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

After 1986, this period was marked by a heightened cultural consciousness.  President Corazon Aquino promoted culture through creation of the National Commission for Culture and Arts (NCCA).

The distance between native and foreign anthropologists is a conflict in the Philippines.  While most scholars receive formal education in Western societies, they often return "home" and view their native society through a foreign, Westernized lens they were conditioned and educated by.  Native anthropologists are hindered by a perspective based on bias.  Interests, training, values, and field exposure can result in differences between foreign and native anthropologists.  It is important to recognize these different angles, politics of representation, and ethnographic authority in order to successful observe others as well as our own societies.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Another challenge in anthropology in the Philippines is discussed by Filipino anthropologist, Carlos Jr. P Tatel, about funding for research on governmental and regional levels.  He explains that anthropology proposals for funding often deviate from original plan in order to fit the agendas of agencies who grant travel and research funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=|last=Tatel|first=Carlos Jr. P.|date=2017|work=Video Interview|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Siberia ===
[[Siberia]] as a territory was important in the development of Russian anthropology due to its position of alterity within Russia. Siberia and the people of [[Northern Russia]] were points of great interest throughout various periods in Russian history as it tried to better understand its own people.
[[File:Vladimir_Bogoraz.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vladimir_Bogoraz.jpg|thumb|Vladimir Bogoraz, one of the founding fathers of Siberian studies in Russia]]
The beginnings of ethnographic research in Siberia were heavily influenced by anthropology in Germany and ideas of Russian nationalism in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62324831|title=World anthropologies : disciplinary transformations within systems of power|last=Vakhtin|first=Nikolai|publisher=|others=Ribeiro, Gustavo Lins., Escobar, Arturo, 1951-|year=|isbn=9781845201913|location=Oxford, UK|pages=49–65|oclc=62324831}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition led by Franz Boas, the [[Jesup North Pacific Expedition]] from 1897-1902, helped to bring international attention to the concept of doing anthropology in Siberia in relation to Russian anthropology in addition to bringing Boas’ anthropological perspective into Russia.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Also on this expedition were [[Vladimir Bogoraz]], [[Vladimir Jochelson]], and Leo Sternberg, who would be known as the founding fathers of Siberian studies, and influential ethnographers in Russia.

The nationalistic undercurrent in Russia at the time of the beginnings of researching Siberia as a place of intrigue was reflected in the Russians' attitude towards the people in Siberia. The impetus to study Siberians was rooted in the idea that one day the people in the area would all assimilate to Russian culture, and due to this, the current culture of the people should be documented and recorded.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Russian ideologies heavily influenced the research field in Siberia, and studying Russian and Siberian history was an easier route for research due to the uncertainty of what would be acceptable to study under the Russian government in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Under Soviet Russia in the early 20th century, ethnology moved toward a more l[[Structuralist anthropology|structural]] and [[Functionalism (anthropology)|functionalist]] view, with the goal of generally understanding human culture.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; When [[Joseph Stalin]] came into power, this view shifted as Stalin aimed to homogenize Russian culture and identity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Ethnologists were employed by the state with a focus on understanding, regulating, and standardizing the different ethnic groups of Russia.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Central and Eastern Europe ==
[[File:Central_and_Eastern_Europe_Map.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Central_and_Eastern_Europe_Map.png|left|thumb|468x468px|Map of Central and Eastern Europe]]
Central and Eastern Europe includes the countries of Austria, Croatia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, and Hungary among many others. Anthropological study is active in many places Europe through research centers, academic societies, and universities on a range of topics. One of the biggest problems facing anthropologists in Central and Eastern Europe is the need to define themselves as a discipline separate from any other.

== Central Europe ==
Anthropology in central European countries has its roots in [[Germany]]. The establishment of anthropology within central Europe has been a slow process that involved first understanding what the discipline was and then determining how it fit within each country's individual ideals.

[[Austria]]n anthropology has close ties to Germany and is generally intertwined with German-speaking countries.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ranzmaier|first1=Irene|date=2011|title=The Anthropological Society in Vienna and the Academic Establishment of Anthropology in Austria, 1870-1930|url=|journal=Histories of Anthropology Annual|volume=7|issue=1|page=|pages=1–22|accessdate=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karstedt|first=Lars|date=2002|title=The History and Status of Linguistic Anthropology in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland|url=|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=72–87|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the history of anthropology in Austria is foggy until the marked institutionalization of the discipline.

The discipline of [[anthropology]] in [[Switzerland]], like Austria, is closely tied to [[Germany]] and German-speaking countries in general.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; Swiss anthropology originated with studying [[folklore]], also known as [[volkskunde]], and ethnology, or völkerkunde.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Between 1912 and 1916, ethnographic museums held seminars in [[ethnology]] and folklore and were the beginning of anthropology being taught in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Eastern Europe ==
Anthropology in Eastern Europe varies in is roots, but many of the different anthropologies share a common interest in folklore and human populations. Eastern European anthropologists, official and non official, tend to focus on studying local issues and staying out of international affairs. The anthropological trend in Eastern Europe is a turn toward the social sciences and anthropology after separation from the [[Soviet Union]].

After separating from the Soviet Union, Belarus went through a period of state development that lasted from about 1990 to 1994. During this time, the focus was on nation-building. This required both an institutional and ideological change from the time when Belarus was under Soviet rule. A policy of “[[Belarusization|Belarusisation]]” was implemented in order to bring back culture and language that was understood to be native to Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bekus|first=Nelly|date=2014|title=Ethnic Identity in Post-Soviet Belarus: Ethnolinguistic Survival as an Argument in the Political Struggle|url=|journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|volume=35|issue=1|pages=43–58|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, anthropological research focused on the characteristics of populations within Belarus, looking at perceived internal “others”. In the 1980s, anthropologists were looking at the genetic structure of human populations based on demographics and environment, along with a study of Belarus’s child population. Belarusian anthropologists also looked outside of Belarus through the Research Institute and Museum of Anthropology from [[Moscow State University]] in order to study the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], [[Eskimo]]s, [[Kazakhs]], and [[Khakas people|Khakas]] peoples.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Her teacher was V.P. Alekseev of Russia. From her research, she concluded that “Belarusians manage to stay within variations which are typical for Caucasian race.” Tegako took part in much of the work in the 1980s on both the genetic structure of human populations and the child studies. She also led twenty expeditions outside of Belarus.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Lidiya Ivanovana is also an important character in Belarusian anthropology. She obtained her PhD in Russia in 1990 with a dissertation that looked at populations in Belarus. Her work was the first to take a multi-dimensional approach involving different types of materials from several different populations within Belarus. Ivanovana is attributed as having contributed many of the anthropological methods used in Belarus.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Bulgaria ===
[[File:NBU_blue.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NBU_blue.jpg|thumb|'''New Bulgarian University''']]
Anthropology appeared in an official status in [[Bulgaria]] in late 1989 due to the fall of the [[Communist Regime|communist regime]] and is thought to be a product of democratization of society. The first departments to include something like anthropology were departments of ethnology, which were concerned with ethnography and folklore, and were worked in to the departments of [[philology]] or history. Anthropology itself was introduced at [[New Bulgarian University]] (NBU) as a priority, but they had to combine with a discipline recognized by the state, which like in many other cases, was the department of sociology with the degree being a sociology one. It wasn’t until around 2004 that anthropology got its own department with its own degree in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

One of Bulgarian anthropology’s main focuses at first was to carve out their own niche as a discipline, especially considering that Bulgarian anthropologists come from a variety of backgrounds. They were also left with ideas from the socialist period and the fall of communism. There was also focus on the changing social conditions from the period of transition after the fall of communism. There was push for democratization in Bulgaria, and anthropology became something of a symbol for that change.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Despite this, there was still polarization on methods and ideology within the new discipline based on debates about Soviet versus Western styles of education, which were understood to be ideological opposites. The shift was eventually toward Western ideas. Bulgarian anthropologists tend to focus on research within their own borders, but also research in [[Balkans]]. Despite the branching out of Bulgaria, there are a limited number of field-research sites, a limited number of subjects, and a limited number of methods taken advantage of by Bulgarian anthropologists. Much attention is paid to community formation, complex societies, power, polity, statehood, nationalism, myth, ritual, religion, marriage, kinship, ethnicity, nation-hood, magic, medicine, and multiculturality.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Czech Republic ===
[[File:LocationCzechRepublic.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LocationCzechRepublic.png|thumb|250x250px|'''Location of Czech Republic on the map''']]
The [[Czech Republic]] takes a constructivist approach to anthropology (closely connected to ethnology), which they take a positivist approach to.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jakoubek|first=Marek|date=2016|title=Anthropology in Eastern Europe Between Positivism and Constructivism: A Case from the Czech Republic|url=|journal=Anthropological Notebooks|publisher=Slovene Anthropological Society|volume=22|issue=3|pages=25–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnology is taken to be trying to get at objective truth, where anthropology is getting at social constructs and beliefs. Despite this split between ideas of ethnology and anthropology in the Czech Republic, anthropology is not yet a fully established discipline. After the split from communism in 1989, there was a turn to socio-cultural anthropology in the way of ideology, but it was inconsistent. Some academics saw it as the same thing as ethnology, while others thought of it as a different research field with different methods and traditions, which resulted in the difficulty of establishing anthropology as a discipline. Many argue for there being a real epistemological difference between the two approaches.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== Hungary ===
[[Hungary|Hungarian]] anthropology is a defined discipline with its own departments and methods, though there is still overlap between anthropology and other related departments, like history and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keen|first=Mike|last2=Mucha|first2=Janusz|date=|title=Sociology in Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990s: A Decade of Reconstruction|url=|journal=European Societies|volume=6|issue=2|pages=123–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian anthropology places a premium on verifying sociological and anthropological results with scientific data.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bokonyi|first=Sandor|last2=Hofer|first2=Tamas|last3=Kiszely|first3=Istvan|last4=Szepe|first4=Gyorgy|last5=Maday|first5=Bela|date=February 1970|title=On Hungarian Anthropology|url=|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=11|issue=1|pages=61–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the ''Ethnographic Research Group'', which was attached to the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] was founded. It was led by [[Gyula Ortutay]] and had twenty-two participating members. The research focused on Hungarian folklore, but the group also looked at peasant economy, social institutions, and Siberian tribal society. If a senior member had an interest outside of Hungary, then that was also a permissible research topic.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Cultural Anthropological departments were established at the [[University of Budapest]] in 1990 and the [[University of Miskolc]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63116730|title=Three social science disciplines in Central and Eastern Europe : handbook on economics, political science and sociology, 1989-2001|date=2002|publisher=Social Science Information Centre (IZ)|others=Kaase, Max., Sparschuh, Vera., Wenninger, Agnieszka., Gesellschaft Sozialwissenschaftlicher Infrastruktureinrichtungen., Collegium Budapest.|isbn=3820601392|location=Berlin|oclc=63116730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many places to publish anthropological works within Hungary. The majority of the work is published in languages other than Hungarian and appear mostly in European periodicals. Many of the works do not appear in American anthropological journals due to a gap in how things are understood between the two anthropological fields. Many Hungarian anthropologists believe that the methods and problems that they need to consider are within their own borders or within their own region. They tend to stay out of international problems and direct their funding toward internal concerns.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Bela C. Maday points out that communication is not a strong suit for Hungarian anthropologists, which makes communicating ideas with core anthropologists, like those from the U.S. or Western Europe, difficult, but there has been much dispute on this point.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Russia ===
[[File:Russian_Academy_of_Sciences_SPB.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Russian_Academy_of_Sciences_SPB.jpg|thumb|'''[[Russian Academy of Sciences]]''' in Saint Petersburg]]
The beginnings of anthropology in [[Russia]] can be traced back to the establishment of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] under [[Peter the Great]] in 1725.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Following the Academy of Sciences, many museums were also created with the impetus for studying culture, including the Ethnographic Bureau of the [[Russian Geographical Society]] in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The 1840s also saw the creation of [[physical anthropology]] and [[archaeology]] as sub-disciplines of anthropology.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In 1864 the first university department for anthropology in Russia was created at [[Moscow University]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The first specialized journal for Russian anthropology, (trans.) The Ethnographic Review ([http://journal.iea.ras.ru/en/index.htm Etnograficheskoe obozrenie]), was created in 1889.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; As Russia did not have state-supplemented funding in the 19th century, much of the financial support came from aristocrats such as Count [[Aleksey Uvarov]] and Prince V. N. Tenishev.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
[[File:Kunstkamera_(Peter_the_Great_Museum_of_Anthropology_and_Ethnography)_in_Saint_Petersburg_3.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kunstkamera_(Peter_the_Great_Museum_of_Anthropology_and_Ethnography)_in_Saint_Petersburg_3.jpg|thumb|276x276px|'''Kunstkamera''' (Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography) in Saint Petersberg]]
In the early 20th century, St. Petersburg and Moscow would be centers for the development of anthropology—focused on ethnology and ethnography—with the formation of the Department of Ethnology in Leningrad (1928), Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (1924), the publication of the journal ''Ethnography'' (1926), the Anuchin Institute of Anthropology at the University of Moscow (1922), etc. Anthropology in Russia was also influenced by Western anthropological perspectives, such as [[Franz Boas]].

Following the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] takeover, Russia began to favor ethnology over anthropology. Ethnology was the study of different ethnic groups within the state, which supported the push for homogenization and national unification of the Russian state. [[Marxism|Marxist theory]] replaced Western anthropological theory, and various university departments were closed as Russia experienced an ideological reconstruction.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In the mid-20th century, with undercurrents of the [[Cold War]], social and cultural anthropology were rejected from ethnographic study, but ethnography was re-institutionalized and strengthened in universities and institutions across Russia.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the latter half of the 20th century, Russian ethnography to other parts of the world in which Soviet influence was strong, such as [[Eastern Europe]]. The [[Perestroika]] in 1985 led to another bout of reconstruction for anthropology, and Russian science in general. Institutes were renamed and reconfigured to match this new trend. Social anthropology also began to make a comeback, leading to identity problems for social anthropology as a discipline in a country with such a strong ethnographic tradition that had excluded it for years.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The 1990s, a time of great social and political change for Russia with the end of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], were a time for critical introspective views on the recent past.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; With this, Russian anthropology turned towards more contemporary interests, where it still is today. Even with these contemporary interests, Russian anthropology still finds itself heavily influenced by the ethnology of its past and attempting to reconcile what it means to be a “social” anthropologist in this environment.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Anthropology of the Arab World ==
The discipline of [[anthropology]] is not new to the [[Arab world]]. While there were no established anthropological institutions until the 20th century, scholars such as [[Abu Rayhan al-Biruni]] and [[Ibn Khaldun]], are recognized for their contribution to the discipline as early as the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ata.org.tn/fichier_PDF/tsr5-2012-chaabani.pdf|title=Insights on the history of Anthropology|last1=Chaabani|first1=Hassen|website=ata.org|publisher=International Journal of Modern Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egypt]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], and the [[Persian Gulf]] region have received most of the scholarly attention, with a particular focus on [[nationalism]] and the state. The Arab youth are a growing area of interest for anthropologists in the [[Arab world]]. Comparatively little research is done in [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], the [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Iraq]]. This is in part a result of accessibility and the conditions of the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That status of anthropology in the Arab world would be labeled as peripheral in relation to anthropology in other regions of the world.

== Middle East ==

=== Iran ===
The man known as the father of Iranian Anthropology was named [[Sadegh Hedayat]] (1903-1951). His focus was on folklore. In 1937, an institute of ethnology was founded in Iran, which then closed in 1941. It then reopened with the rise to power of [[Mohammed Reza Shah]]. From 1956 to 1959, it published a journal titled "Majalle-ye Mardomshenasi" (Journal of Anthropology). In 1957, the first anthropological elective course offered at a college level in Iran began at the [[University of Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shahshahani|first1=Soheila|date=1986|title=History of Anthropology in Iran|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=19|issue=1|pages=65–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, there was not as much of an emphasis placed on receiving degrees from foreign universities. Similarly, international research was also not highly valued. International study and research, however, has begun gaining more and more importance within the departments of anthropology in Iran. Anthropology in Iran suffers from a poor reputation in the public sphere. It is considered to be a weak discipline, according to Iranian anthropologist, [[Soheila Shahshahani]]. Perhaps because of this, most students of the social sciences tend to choose other disciplines, such as law, management, and psychology. As society changes, more attention is being paid to the field. Today, ethnographic research in the area focused on internal subjects, such as the pastoralists living in the arid areas around Iran. These studies continue today, but other fields of interest have started to emerge. A new focus on small town life and rural areas has recently developed. Professor Shahshanani states that the weakness of current anthology in Iran is the lack of theoretical work done by its practitioners. She also goes on to say that these issues could be solved by getting Iranian anthropologists who have trained elsewhere to come back and practice in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dominguez|first1=Virginia|last2=Metzner|first2=Emily|title=An Interview With Iranian Anthropologist Soheila Shahshahani|journal=American Anthropologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Levant ==

=== Lebanon ===
The department of sociology at the [[American University of Beirut]] was the first to offer an anthropology course, which is listed in its 1950-51 catalogue. The department of anthropology was officially founded in the 1970s, and saw 33 students graduate with a Master of Arts degree in anthropology throughout that decade. The [[Lebanese Civil War]], which lasted from 1975-1990, interfered with the development of the department and anthropology at the university saw a decline as a direct result. During this time, the new department of social and behavioral sciences (SBS) which already encompassed sociology, psychology, and communication, absorbed the anthropology department.&lt;ref name="Anthropology in Beirut"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/873907/Anthropology_in_Beirut|title=Anthropology in Beirut|last1=King|first1=Diane E|last2=Scheid|first2=Kirsten|website=academia|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, records show just one student having graduated with a Master of Arts degree in anthropology, while there were none in the 1990s. There were three anthropologists on the faculty throughout this time. Among them were Fuad Khuri, Martha Mundy, and Gerald Obermeyer.

A survey conducted in 1989 by Seteney Shami, a 1976 graduate of the BA program in anthropology at the American University in Beirut, sought to learn more about the teachings of anthropology at universities in the Arab world. Her findings suggested that the role of the discipline in the Arab world were minimal. In an academic report that came out in 2006, anthropologists at the same university claim to have found little evidence in the local community of any significant changes since.

Today's anthropology graduates in Lebanon have opportunities to work with local NGOs. However, for those interested in pursuing anthropology as a discipline, the West still stands as the one destination for that. Anthropology departments at the American University in Beirut, and in Lebanon, are stifled by war.&lt;ref name="Anthropology in Beirut"/&gt;

As a destination for anthropologists to do research, Lebanon is among the top spots for emerging scholars in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palestine ===
Palestine has seen an increase in research conducted in the territory and among the Paletinian communities in Isarel, as well as refugee camps in neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Palestinian anthropology can be marked by four modes of ethnographic engagement: Biblical Palestine, Oriental Palestine, Absent Palestine, and Post-Structural Palestine.

'''Biblical Palestine''' refers to the main method of ethnographic engagement of Palestine which took place in the first decades of the 20th century. Led predominately by Europeans, their interest was motivated by the use of the Bible as a legitimizing text to influence the region. Early work consisted of European writers fetishizing and romanticizing the land and the people based on the Biblical figures.

'''Oriental Palestine''', a term coined by a Palestinian scholar (find scholar, cite) was the leading mode of engagement throughout the first four decades of the 20th century. It was marked by a sense of urgency to document Palestine as a source of Europe's beginnings. Through this lens, a narrative was offered that challenged the colonial British vision of Palestinian history which saw the Arabs there as "transient and ephemeral". It was also marked by a sense of duty among others to capture the traditional fabric of Palestine before it's dissolution, which appeared evident at the time due to the events surrounding the rise of Zionism.

'''Absent Palestine''' follows immediately after the demise of Palestine in 1948, and can only be fully understood in terms of the success of Zionism. In this sense, the state of Palestine was eclipsed by the narrative of Israel as a place offering a safe haven to endangered refugees from Europe. This ethnographic silence of Palestinians is seen as the turning point in Israel's image of modernity.

'''Post-Structural Palestine''' is the current main method of ethnographic engagement. It is known primarily for its stance that challenges and brings to question Israel's efforts to repress Palestinian nationalism. The movement has seen a rising trend in which the Palestinian subject is explored for their national identity, rather than silenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-anthro-081309-145910|title=The Ethnographic Arriving of Palestine|last1=Furani|first1=Khaled|last2=Rabinowitz|first2=Dan|website=annualreviews.org|publisher=Review in Advance|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkey ===
Anthropology as a discipline in Turkey can trace its roots back to 1925. Developing in an nationalistic atmosphere, The Anthropology Institute, otherwise known as The Center for Anthropological Research in Turkey, was established on that year within the Faculty of Medicine at the [[University of Istanbul]]. From 1925 to the 1960s, the main topics of research centered around studies of rural and village life, with a focus on nation building. In the 1960s, a series of military coups occurred, causing considerable changes to the field and to academia itself. It was not until the year 1997 that the first official department of anthropology was established in Turkey, at the private [[Yeditepe University]] in Istanbul. As of 2010, 6 of the 53 state universities in Turkey offered training in anthropology. In contrast to this, only one of the 24 private universities offer similar training. The first anthropological association in Turkey was founded in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Other People's Anthropologies: Ethnographic Practice On The Margins|last1=Bošković,|first1=Aleksandar|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|pages=110–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persian Gulf ==

=== Saudi Arabia ===
Many Anthropologists investigate the tribal system in Saudi Arabia. Anthropology was not popular in many countries; however, the Universities in Saudi Arabia are adopting Anthropology. 
* What is the opposite of the impression of tribes is the ideology of regression. The idea that the tribe gets its meaning from the patriarchal descent. Which is now called Saudi genealogy. One of the famous genealogy is Hamad Aljassar who dead in 2000(Alshamlan). 
* Golf scholars are interested in how migrants and other racial groups are racialized by the legal system. They are also interested in examining the built environment, the history of the transnational connection and the rapid social change (Deep &amp; Winger).

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Anthropological studies, which are concerned with the privacy of the UAE community with a tribal background are rare and limited.
* Most of the studies are written with other international anthropologists such as the ethnographic observations of a British Anthropologists Bertram Thomas.
Tribes are the most form of UAE. Many anthropologists are interested in investigating the form of tribes. Many of the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] are also based on the tribal system.
* Moreover, there are many migrants in UAE from two sides: The first side is the center and the south of the Arabian Peninsula. The second side of the eastern coast of the [[Persian Gulf]], contains many foreign migrations from the neighboring countries of Asia.There are also migrants from Iran. The main intention of those migrants is settling in UAE.
* The UAE community is a multi-tribal community. A multi-cultural community that divides communities into socially and economically linked in different sectors of the workforce(Alsnagry).

=== Qatar and Bahrain ===
In Qatar and Bahrain, anthropology was not as popular as other fields, like many other countries in the Persian Gulf region. Anthropology is expanding in educational aspect. Many anthropologists are also concerned on the structure of the tribes in the Arab countries in the Persian Gulf region (Gardner).

== North Africa ==

=== Egypt ===
Within the Arab-majority countries, [[Egypt]], has established itself among the other Arab-majority countries as the main hub for anthropologists in the region, with [[Cairo]] being the center for most of this attention. The rest of the country remains relatively understudied. Increased attention to [[Cairo]] can be attributed to the rise of anthropological interest in cities, particularly to the diverse interdisciplinary scholarship.

The centrality of Middle East area studies is largely responsible for the increase in anthropological attention towards Egypt. In addition to this is the accessibility of institutional support for US scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the early 21st century, the relationship of Egypt with anthropology remains under question. Egyptian anthropologist, [[Hania Sholkamy]], remarks that there are four main points that shape this ongoing relationship: the relationship of methods to theory, the relationship between methods and their analysis, the relationship of culture to its determinants, and the relationship between having data and being able to evaluate it.

The discipline of anthropology is in a constant state of judgment within Egypt, particularly when compared with the discipline of demography. The qualitative data more common in demography is given more attention than the theoretical and analytical methods associated with anthropology.

=== Morocco ===
In Morocco, topics of anthropological research include the ethnicization of Jews, the construction of ethnicity among Berber, Arab, and Haratine groups through agricultural practices, and how Berber ethnicities are politicized in ways that create raced and gendered notions of homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==
The region of Africa has had a long history of being colonized by others in economic and cultural ways, which is why the study of anthropology in Africa is a relatively new discipline that is usually grouped with historical work. Before becoming a discipline in the region, Western anthropologists came to the area to study and conduct ethnographies pertaining to the native culture of those who inhabited the area. Anthropologists in African academia are still on looking for what anthropology means to them.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nyamnjoh|first=F.|date=2012|title=Blinded by Sight: Divining the Future of Anthropology in Africa|url=|journal=Institute of African Affairs at GIGA,|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While anthropology was initially used by states to gain knowledge about local cultures, it was later seen as a way to help them. After the recognition of its importance many universities and associations have institutionalized departments, journals and conferences to carry out this work.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62324831|title=World anthropologies : disciplinary transformations within systems of power|others=Ribeiro, Gustavo Lins., Escobar, Arturo, 1951-|isbn=9781845201913|location=Oxford, UK|oclc=62324831}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article includes the history, development, and future of African Anthropology in different regions.

The majority of British, as well as German, anthropologists dominated Kenya with their studies focusing solely on the groups of people who were considered to be distinct, or “otherly”.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; While some anthropologists studied these groups in order to achieve dominance over them, other anthropologists reasoned studying the communities for educational purposes before their culture no longer existed due to colonizing.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Thus, causing a means for Kenya anthropologists to disassociate with colonialism because of its harsh effects on Africans and their culture.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; This forced the local anthropologists to rethink about socio-cultural studies, including their own discipline and how it aided in colonialism.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Even Jomo Kenyatta, who had benefited from his education and studies, was struggling with the decision on whether to associate with the discipline anymore.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

[[Louis Leakey]] aided in bringing archaeology and physical anthropology to light in Kenya. He work as a curator in the [[National Museums of Kenya|Coryndon Memorial Museum]], which is an important establishment that helps to keep excavation sites accessible, such as [[Koobi Fora]], [[Olorgesailie]], and the [[Hyrax Hill Prehistoric Site and Museum|Hyrax Hill]], to both local and foreign archaeologists.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In the 1950s, alongside his wife, Leakey found various primate fossils, including those of [[Paranthropus boisei|Australopithecus Boisei]] (1959), [[Homo habilis|Homo Habilis]] (1964), and [[Kenyapithecus]] (1967).&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In 1960, he established the [http://www.primateresearch.org/ Institute of Primate Research] (IPR) which helped in comprehending human evolution and biomedical research for health challenges in Africa, such as HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

[[File:Daniel_arap_Moi_1979b.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Daniel_arap_Moi_1979b.jpg|thumb|230x230px|Daniel Arap Moi]]
Since the discipline of anthropology was associated with colonialism, the nation-state of Kenya did not identify with its trajectories and could not support it.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; It wasn’t until [[Daniel arap Moi|Daniel Arap Moi]], who succeeded Jomo as president, made culture a central means for socio-economic aspects, making anthropology slowly begin to gain popularity again among locals due to its national cultural ethos.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In 1965, the [[University of Nairobi]] established its Institute for Development Studies which contained two aspects of social science and cultural divisions.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The social science aspect of the department went on to develop its own Institute of Development Studies, which carried out economic development but through a multidisciplinary approach.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The cultural divisions aspect used resources that informed university students, as well as regionally, from a cultural instruction perspective.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In 1970, the two subjects came together and were known as the [[Institute of African Studies]] (IAS), in which students researched in African archaeology, history, social anthropology, musicology, linguistics, oral literature, traditional arts, crafts, and social systems;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogot|first=B.E.|date=1999|title=Building on the Indigenous: Selected Essays 1981-1998|url=|journal=Kisumu: Anyange Press|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this institute even contributed to some of the top scholars such as musicologists [[P.N.

Ochieng’]], and writers [[Okot p'Bitek|Okot p’Bitek]] and [[Taban Lo Liyong|Taban lo Liyong]].&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In 1986, the IAS had established its first anthropology training program, providing courses of medical, linguistic, economic, and ecological anthropology and material culture (Amuyunzu-Nyamongo, 2006).&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Challenges and Prospects for Applied Anthropology in Kenya|last=Amuyunzu-Nyamongo|first=M.|publisher=African Anthropology: History, Critique, and Practice|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Anthropological Future ====

The future of the discipline of anthropology consists of research projects dedicated to resolving health issues, such as malaria and HIV/AIDS, so it’s not a surprise that most anthropologists in Kenya today are either medical anthropologists or those anthropologists who study medical issues.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Many of these local anthropologists are sought out for help by national non-government health organizations, like [[United States Agency for International Development|United State Agency for International Development]], [[Family Health International]], [[EngenderHealth|Engenderhealth]], [[PATH (global health organization)|PATH]], [[Population Council]], [[African Population and Health Research Center]], [[African medical and research foundation|African Medical Research Foundation]], the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Kenyan anthropologists do not conduct research for personal needs, but for needs of their nation-state and those funding agencies that they provide information to for health resolutions.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In response to this upcoming need, universities are developing programs, like Anthropology in Developing Countries, Applied Anthropology, Medical Anthropology, and  Anthropology and Infectious Diseases, that educate for cultural developmental skills.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

==== Teaching ====

The [[University of Yaoundé I|University of Yaoundé-I]] is a main institution in the area providing students with opportunities to gain degrees in Anthropology.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; Other Institutions of importance are the [[University of Ngaoundéré|University of Ngaoundere]] and the [[University of Buea]] which in 1992 added anthropology departments.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Both of these universities produce scholars from the local communities and they promote research that is of common interest to the area. Language being a barrier in academia until its independence, in 1960, where universities were fashioned in the European style of education systems.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; The University of Buea, a public university, offered the subjects in the English language which increased the number of local students that attend. Largely associated with sociology, the first person to gain a PhD in [[Social anthropology|Social Anthropology]] from Cameroon was Paul Nkwi in 1975. In 1993, a B.A. in anthropology could be received form the [[University of Yaoundé]].&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

==== Research ====

A stepping-stone organization was [[Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa|CODESRIA]], which was an organization that helped develop and promote anthropology as an institution.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; It facilitated the establishment of the [[Pan African Anthropological Association]] (PAAA) in the 80s.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; The PAAA is cooperative movement that unified Anthropologists from all over Africa. Its goal was to make anthropology known again as a useful and essential department that Africa needed.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; This association is holding conferences annually, starting in 1989, to advance Anthropology and find ways to solve problems for the future.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; Some dominant research topics in the area are witchcraft, chiefdoms, health, violence and ethno-history.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; The PAAA started encouraging communication of cross disciplines to benefit Africa as a whole by discovering new ways of resolving issues.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; A leading journal in Africa is the [[African Anthropologist|African Anthropology]], now known as [[African Anthropologist|The African Anthropologist]], allows research from all over Africa to be shared and more easily accessible.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;

==== History ====

The history of the discipline of anthropology in South Africa comes from the result of political and ideological interpretations of the research there.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spiegel|first=Andrew D.|last2=Becker|first2=Heike|date=2015-12-01|title=South Africa: Anthropology or Anthropologies?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aman.12353/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=117|issue=4|pages=754–760|doi=10.1111/aman.12353|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the [[South African Association for the Advancement of Science]] was established, and it was here that anthropology was known.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Presentations were given by archeologists, linguists, anthropologists, and ethnologists; there was also a South African Journal of Science that many researchers published in as well.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; During the years of the 1940s to the 1990s, anthropology grew to be less popular due to the [[apartheid]] period, which in educators had strict guidelines as to what they could and couldn’t teach in the classroom, and they were not permitted to teach anything else but that particular curriculum.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Anthropological studies and research were offered at sixteen different universities, in which [[sociocultural anthropology]] and [[archaeology]] were offered within the discipline, and in another department, [[linguistics]], [[African studies]], and [[Gender studies]] were linked in the discipline.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Instead of using the word or teaching anthropology, the universities, more specifically [[Stellenbosch University]], taught [[Volkskunde|''volkekunde'']], which means knowledge about people, and it was first known from pre-WWII German passage that was written by [[wiktionary:Völkerkunde|Völkerkunde]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; This expansion of the discipline was also known as [[ethnology]] or [[cultural anthropology]], and it was paired with aspects of the apartheid period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://read.dukeupress.edu/lookup/doi/10.1215/9780822387107-012|title="Today We Have Naming of Parts"|last=Kuper|first=Adam|pages=277–299|language=en|doi=10.1215/9780822387107-012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a division between social anthropology and volkekunde, as well as Afrikaans-medium universities and English-medium universities, respectively.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

==== Stellenbosch University and South African Relationship with the U.K. and U.S. ====

[[Stellenbosch University]] (an Afrikaan-medium university) had established its first anthropological department due to [[Max Eiselen|Werner Eiselen]], who was the Permanent Secretary in the National Department of Native Affairs, as well as being a developer of the concept of apartheid, with [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] being his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Todd|date=1998|title=Review of Imperfect Interpreters: South Africa's Anthropologists 1920-1990|jstor=3034850|journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|volume=4|issue=4|pages=811–812|doi=10.2307/3034850}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were then new universities that were built in the 1960s, specifically for black students, which led to the continuation of the two types of universities within the area.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The professors who obtained jobs at the new universities had a background that dealt with a volkekunde style of teaching anthropology. This entire movement didn’t appeal to those who identified themselves as social anthropologists in the discipline.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Even with this division of the methods to anthropological research, there was a mutual respect and influence for social anthropological studies that were being conducted by researchers in the U.K., as well as the U.S. Most students were moving on to proceed in getting their doctoral degrees preferred to attend the [[University of Cambridge]], due to its influence of academia through anthropologists who were South African natives, such as [[Meyer Fortes]], [[Isaac Schapera]], and [[Max Gluckman]]. South African anthropologists, such as [[Jean Comaroff]] and [[John Comaroff]] and Namibian-born Rob Gordon, who began their studies in their home region of South Africa, and more specifically at the Afrikaans-medium University of Stellenbosch, also had influence with the U.S. in their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Robert|date=2014-04-03|title=Inside African anthropology: Monica Wilson and her interpreters|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23323256.2014.940183|journal=Anthropology Southern Africa|volume=37|issue=1-2|pages=135–138|doi=10.1080/23323256.2014.940183|issn=2332-3256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Self-Exile and Volkekunde Conference ====

[[File:The_University_of_South_Africa.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_University_of_South_Africa.jpg|thumb|290x290px|The University of South Africa]]
In the 1960s, South African anthropologists made the decision to start leaving their country for careers and research studies because of the apartheid methods, the inequality within their societies, and there was an increase in the violence that was surrounding the region. In 1967, a committee was formed in order to begin negotiating anthropological conferences that were held at the [[University of South Africa]], which added to the separation and tension of the social anthropologists and those who studied volkekunde.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Ten years later, black anthropologists started to attend these conferences, and this made the volkekunde group to initiate another new conference that was only to host research projects to those studying ethnology; this new conference was known in the [[Afrikaans]] language as ''Vereniging van Afrikaanse Volkekundiges'', which is translated to mean [[Association of Afrikaans Ethnologists]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; This conference excluded entry to those who did not speak the original Afrikaans language of South Africa, or the regional state area, and it continued to have majority and favor until the 1980s when the social anthropologists decided to have their own conference as well.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

==== Social Anthropology Conference ====

[[The Association for Anthropology in Southern Africa]] (AASA) was established in 1987 excluded membership into the group for those who believed in the apartheid concepts. Before anyone could become members of the conference, they were to sign a document, or a contract, saying that they reject any and all apartheid theories and concepts.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Regardless of this new conference, the methods of volkekunde remained to be prominent in the discipline of anthropology, though during the 1980s, the anthropology department of then known [[Rand Afrikaans University]], which was one of the newer White Afrikaans-medium universities in the area, officially denounced volkekunde as their way of research, in fact, the entire teaching department of this discipline turned their backs to apartheid concepts entirely.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Later on, [[Stellenbosch University]], which was where the first volkekunde department to be established, was closed down in the mid-1990s. A few years afterward, the discipline of social anthropology was introduced within the Department of Sociology.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

The new association of [http://www.asnahome.org/ Anthropology South Africa] was a cause to link the two distinguished branches of volkekunde and social anthropology. Its first annual conference was in 2001. In 2004, it became one of the founding members of the [https://www.wcaanet.org/ World Council of Anthropology Associations] in Brazil.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; There aren’t very many volkekundiges, or ethnologists, who have membership within the ASnA, nor do most of them attend any of the conferences that are held. A majority of those who do attend the annual conference are young, predominantly black, postgraduate anthropologists, but there are also a growing number of faculty members from the South African University anthropology programs who participate as well.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Though the faculty participation numbers are growing, the overall number of memberships within the ASnA fluctuate from year to year. This is due to postgraduates, who are members only having a membership for a year or two in order to obtain their dissertations.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; There is also a close link between membership and conference attendance, meaning that since the conferences are held in venues that are less accessible or less desirable, this doesn’t attract many anthropologists to participate and fewer people sign up for memberships.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

==== Topics of Research and Publication ====

Some of the topics of research for sociocultural anthropologists in South Africa consist of [[medical anthropology]], mostly concerning the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] in the region, [[development anthropology]], [[urbanism]], science and natural resources, conflict, violence and policing, [[human rights]], [[identity politics]] and belonging, and [[Popular culture studies|popular culture]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; There isn’t much attention paid to subjects, such as [[economic anthropology]], [[state formation]], and [[religion]] and [[religious movements]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Anthropologists at South African universities mostly publish to edited volumes and special theme collections in interdisciplinary and disciplinary journals in their own country, as well as internationally.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; One significant publication venue for South African anthropologists is the journal formerly known as the volkekunde’s Tydskrif van Suid Afrikaanse Volkekunde, which translates to [[Journal of South African Ethnology]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The journal changed its name to [http://www.asnahome.org/ Anthropology Southern Africa] in 2002.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

== Postcolonial African Anthropology ==

=== The Future of the Discipline ===

Anthropologists, who studied in Africa and began their research from basic curiosities, cannot be of aid to how the discipline stays in existence.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Anthropology thrived from outside and inside perspectives of the same region or aspect of culture; having a [[Civilizing mission|missions civilisatrice]] perspective divided observer and participant, instead of taking into consideration the culture within the region from the perspectives of those who have lived there.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The aspect of not being able, or not wanting to, collaborate with natives from the country was due to the [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowskian]] model.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Researchers developed their own personal objectives and reasoning to what and who they were observing in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faris|first=Wendy B.|last2=Clifford|first2=James|title=The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth-Century Ethnography, Literature, and Art|jstor=1770355|journal=Comparative Literature|language=en|volume=44|issue=2|doi=10.2307/1770355}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused an explicit division of Africa into several regions based on finding and observing the exotic “Other” from various basis of culture, race, and location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/605/chapter/127376/|title=Beyond "Culture"|last=Gupta|first=Akhil|last2=Ferguson|first2=James|pages=33–51|language=en|doi=10.1215/9780822382089-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Imagining insiders: Africa and the question of belonging|url=http://choicereviews.org/review/10.5860/CHOICE.37-5492|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=37|issue=10|pages=37–5492–37-5492|doi=10.5860/choice.37-5492}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] helped anthropologists to realize that their personal needs and reasoning for research correlated with the aspect of seeing people differently instead of similarly.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; There was no insight from those who had inhabited the continent for centuries, and the country is not well represented.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; There was not a lot of support for methods that contradicted what had already been practiced and known within the discipline.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Universally, there were various debates about the methodology of the discipline in relation to folklore, co-production with aid of natives, and boundaries within the field.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; These aspects had not been taken into consideration when observing the region. Anthropology surviving in Africa were due to not observing Africa explicitly as scientific (racially or geographically), not seeing African identities and cultures as scientific, redefining the Malinowskian model, and making the methods of fieldwork and participant observation more flexible.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Native anthropologists called for creative diversity and outsider anthropologists to observe themselves and how they contributed to the professional collaboration with those who were native to the region.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; This methodology or concept did not replace outside methods, but correlated the two methods together in knowledge about culture.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

'''Hotspot Ecosystem Research and Man's Impact On European Seas''' ('''HERMIONE''') is an international multidisciplinary project, started in April 2009, that studies deep-sea [[ecosystems]].&lt;ref name=hermione&gt;[http://www.eu-hermione.net/ '''HERMIONE''' website, http://www.eu-hermione.net/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weaver1&gt;Weaver et al.

Major aims of the project are to understand how humans are affecting the deep-sea environment and to provide policy makers with accurate scientific information, enabling effective management strategies to protect deep sea ecosystems.The HERMIONE project is funded by the [[European Commission]]'s [[Seventh Framework Programme]], and is the successor to the [[HERMES project]], which concluded in March 2009.&lt;ref name=hermes&gt;[http://www.eu-hermes.net/ '''HERMES''' website, http://www.eu-hermes.net/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
Europe's deep-ocean margin, from the [[Arctic]] to the [[Iberian Margin]], and across the [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Black Sea]],  spans a distance of over 15,000&amp;nbsp;km and hosts a number of diverse habitats and ecosystems. [[Deep water coral]] reefs, [[undersea mountains]] populated by a multitude of organisms, vast [[submarine canyon]] systems, and [[hydrothermal vent]]s are some of the features contained therein.&lt;ref name=schloesser2&gt;Schloesser, Manfred (2009). [http://www.innovations-report.de/html/berichte/geowissenschaften/ausbrueche_tiefsee_schlammvulkans_haakon_mosby_135655.html Ausbrüche des Tiefsee-Schlammvulkans Haakon Mosby] ("Outbreaks of the Deep Sea Mud Volcano Haakon Mosby"). ''Innovations Report'' (website).&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional view of the deep-sea realm as a hostile and barren place was discredited long ago, and scientists now know that much of Europe's deep sea is rich and diverse.&lt;ref name=marum1&gt;Marum - Zentrum für Marine Umweltwissenschaften an der Universität Bremen (2009).

''GMX'' (website).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the deep sea is increasingly threatened by humans: most of this deep-ocean frontier lies within Europe's [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ) and has significant potential for the exploitation of biological, energy, and mineral resources. Research and exploration over the last two decades has shown clear signs of direct and indirect [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic impacts]] in the deep sea, resulting from such activities as [[overfishing]],&lt;ref name=bailey1&gt;Bailey et al. (2009).

This raises concerns because deep-sea processes and ecosystems are not only important for the marine [[food chain|web of life]], but also fundamentally contribute to the global [[biogeochemical cycle]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

(PDFs viewable at website.)&lt;/ref&gt; the HERMIONE project investigates ecosystems at critical sites on Europe's deep-ocean margin, aiming to make major advances in knowledge of their distribution and functioning, and their contribution to ecosystem goods and services.{{Clarify|date=December 2009}} HERMIONE places special emphasis on human impact on the deep sea and on the translation of scientific information into science policy for the sustainable use of marine resources. To design and implement effective governance strategies and management plans to protect our deep seas for the future, understanding the extent, natural dynamics and interconnection of ocean ecosystems, and integrating socio-economic research with natural science, are important. To achieve this, HERMIONE uses a highly interdisciplinary and integrated approach, engaging experts in [[biology]], [[ecology]], [[biodiversity]], [[oceanography]], [[geology]], [[sedimentology]], [[geophysics]] and [[biogeochemistry]], who will work alongside socio-economists and policy-makers.

== Hotspot research ==
The HERMIONE project focuses on deep-sea "hotspot" ecosystems including [[submarine canyon]]s, open slopes and deep basins, [[chemosynthetic]] environments, deep water coral reefs, and [[seamount]]s.  Hotspot ecosystems support high species diversity, numbers of individuals, or both, and are therefore important in maintaining margin-wide biodiversity and abundance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  HERMIONE research ranges from investigation of the ecosystems' dimensions, distribution, interconnection and functioning, to understanding the potential impacts of [[climate change]] and anthropogenic disturbance. The ultimate objective is to provide stakeholders and policymakers with the scientific knowledge necessary to support deep-sea governance, sustainable management and conservation of these ecosystems.

To obtain the data needed, HERMIONE scientists are spending over 1000 days at sea, using more than 50 research vessels across Europe.  Sharing vessels and equipment between partners will bring benefits through shared knowledge, expertise and data, and will also maximise the research effort, increasing efficiency and productivity. State-of-the-art technology will be used, with [[remotely operated underwater vehicle|Remotely Operated Vehicles]] (ROVs) one of the critical pieces of equipment being used for a wide range of delicate manoeuvres and high-resolution surveys, from precision sampling of methane gas at [[cold seep]]s to [[bathymetry|microbathymetry]] mapping to examine the structure of the seabed.  Large arrays of [[mooring (oceanography)|instrumented moorings]], shared by different partner institutions, will be deployed in common experimental areas, allowing HERMIONE to develop experimental strategies beyond any national capacity.

=== Study areas ===
[[Image:Map of research areas.jpg|thumb|alt=map of HERMIONE scientific study areas|Map of HERMIONE areas of scientific research]]

The HERMIONE study sites were selected on the following basis:

*The Arctic because of its importance in monitoring climate change;
*Nordic margin with abundant cold-water corals, extensive [[hydrocarbon exploration]] and the Haakon-Mosby mud volcano (HMMV) natural laboratory;
*Celtic margin with a mid-latitude canyon, cold water corals and the long term [[Porcupine Abyssal Plain]] (PAP) monitoring site;
*Portuguese margin with the highly diverse [[Nazaré Canyon|Nazare]] and [[Setubal canyon]]s;
*Seamounts in the Atlantic and western Mediterranean as important biodiversity hotspots potentially under threat;
*[[Mid-Atlantic Ridge|Mid Atlantic Ridge]] (MAR) [[ESONET]] site to link [[cold seep]] to [[hydrothermal vent|hot seep]] chemosynthetic studies;
*Mediterranean cold water cascading sites in the Gulf of Lions and outflows of the Adriatic and Aegean Seas.

The HMMV, PAP, MAR and central Mediterranean sites link to the ESONET long-term monitoring sites and will provide valuable background information.

HERMIONE scientists use cutting-edge technology to try to answer these questions.&lt;ref name=weaver1 /&gt;  High-resolution mapping of the seafloor will be carried out to determine the location and distribution of cold-water corals, and photographic observations will be made to assess changes in the status of known reefs over time, such as their response to climatic variation or their recovery from destruction by fishing trawlers.  To assess biodiversity and its relationship with environmental factors such as climate change, [[DNA barcoding]] and other molecular techniques will be used.

=== Submarine canyons ===
Submarine canyons are deep, steep-sided valleys that form on continental margins.  Stretching from the shelf to the deep sea, they dissect much of the European margin.  They are one of the most complex seascapes known to humans; their rugged topography and challenging environmental conditions mean that they are also one of the least explored.  Advances in technology over the last two decades have allowed scientists to uncover some of the mysteries of canyons, the size of which often rival the [[Grand Canyon]],&lt;ref&gt;Tyler et al. (2009). [http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/22_1.html "Europe's Grand Canyon"] ''Oceanography'' 22 (1), March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; USA.

One of the most important discoveries is that canyons are major sources and sinks for sediment and organic matter on continental margins.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard et al. (1979). "Currents in submarine canyons and other seavalleys" ''AAPG Studies in Geology'' (8), Tulsa, OK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson et al.

Determining what drives sediment transport and deposition within canyons is one of the major challenges for HERMIONE.

The capacity of canyons to focus and concentrate organic matter can promote high abundances and diversity of fauna.  However, variability in environmental conditions and topography is very high, both within and between canyons, and this is reflected in the variability of the structure and dynamics of the biological communities.&lt;ref&gt;Pattenden (2009) "The influence of submarine canyons on the structure and dynamics of megafauna communities" ''PhD Thesis'', University of Southampton&lt;/ref&gt;  Our understanding of biological processes in canyons has greatly improved with the use of submersibles and ROVs, but this research has also revealed that the relationships between fauna and canyons are more complex than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia et al.

HERMIONE will address this challenge by examining canyon ecosystems from different biogeochemical provinces and topographic settings, in light of the complex interactions among habitat (topography, water masses, currents), mass and energy transfer, and biological communities.

=== Open slopes and deep basins ===
Open slopes and deep basins make up &gt; 90% of the ocean floor and 65% of the Earth's surface, and many of the goods and services provided by the deep sea (e.g., oil, gas, climate regulation and food) are produced and stored by them.  They are intricately involved in global biogeochemical and ecological processes, and so are essential for the functioning of our biosphere and human wellbeing.

Recent research in the HERMES (EC-FP6) project gathered a large body of information on local biodiversity at large scales, different latitudes and in different hotspot ecosystems, but the research also highlighted the high degree of complexity of deep-sea habitats.  This information is fundamental to our understanding of the factors that control biodiversity at much larger scales, from hundreds to thousands of kilometres.  HERMIONE will conduct further studies on the mosaic of habitats found in deep-sea slopes and basins, and will investigate the relationships within and between these habitats, their biodiversity and ecology, and their interconnection with other hotspot ecosystems.

Investigating the impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change in the deep sea is a theme that runs through all HERMIONE research.  To the biological communities on open slopes and in deep basins, seafloor warming through climate change is a major threat.  Up to 85% of methane reservoirs along the continental margin could be destabilised, which would not only release climate-warming methane gas into the atmosphere, but would also have unknown and potentially devastating consequences on benthic communities.  The role of climatic variation on deep-sea benthos is not well understood, although large-scale changes in the structure of seafloor communities have been observed over the last two decades.  The use of long-term, deep-sea observatories, e.g., the Hausgarten deep-sea observatory in the Arctic and the time-series analysis of the Catalan margin and Southern Adriatic Sea, will help HERMIONE scientists to examine recent changes in benthic communities, and to study decadal variability in physical processes, such as the dense shelf water cascading events in submarine canyons.&lt;ref name="Flushing submarine canyons"/&gt;

HERMIONE aims to provide quantitative estimates of the potential consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning, to examine how deep-sea benthos adapt to large-scale changes, and, for the first time, to create conceptual models integrating deep-sea biodiversity and quantitative analyses of ecosystem functioning and processes.

=== Seamounts ===
Seamounts are underwater mountains that rise from the depths of the ocean, and whose summits can sometimes be found just a few hundred metres below the sea surface.  To be classified as a seamount the summit must be 1000 m higher than the surrounding seafloor,&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, P. (2007) "Seamount characteristics" p. 3-25 in ''Seamounts: Ecology, Fisheries and Conservation.'' T.J. Pitcher, T. Morato, P.J.B. Hart, M.R. Clark, N. Haggan, and R.S. Santos (eds), ''Fish and Aquatic Resource Series'', Blackwell, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; and under this definition there are an estimated 1000–2800 seamounts in the Atlantic Ocean and around 60 in the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchingman, A., Lai, S., Morato, T., and Pauly, D. (2007). "How many seamounts are there and where are they located?" p.26-40 in ''Seamounts: Ecology, Fisheries and Conservation.'' T.J. Pitcher, T. Morato, P.J.B. Hart, M.R. Clark, N. Haggan, and R.S. Santos (eds), ''Fish and Aquatic Resource Series'', Blackwell, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamounts enhance water flow through localised tides, eddies, and upwelling, and these physical processes may enhance primary production.&lt;ref&gt;White, M., Bashmachnikov, I., Aristegui, H., and Martins, A. (2007). "Physical processes and seamount productivity" p.65-84 in ''Seamounts: Ecology, Fisheries and Conservation.'' T.J. Pitcher, T. Morato, P.J.B. Hart, M.R. Clark, N. Haggan, and R.S. Santos (eds), ''Fish and Aquatic Resource Series'', Blackwell, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  Seamounts may therefore be considered as hotspots of marine life; fauna benefit from the enhanced hydrodynamics and phytoplankton supply, and thrive on the slopes and summits.  Suspension feeders, such as gorgonian sea fans and the cold-water corals like Lophelia pertusa, often dominate the rich benthic (seafloor-dwelling) communities.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, A., Baco, A., Griffiths, H., Hart, T., and Hall-Spencer, J.M. (2007). "Corals on seamounts" p.141-169 in ''Seamounts: Ecology, Fisheries and Conservation.'' T.J. Pitcher, T. Morato, P.J.B. Hart, M.R. Clark, N. Haggan, and R.S. Santos (eds), ''Fish and Aquatic Resource Series'', Blackwell, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; The enhanced abundance and diversity of fauna is not limited to benthic species, as fish are known to aggregate over seamounts.&lt;ref&gt;Morato, T. and Clark, M.R. (2007). "Seamount fishes: Ecology and life histories" p.170-188 in ''Seamounts: Ecology, Fisheries and Conservation.'' T.J. Pitcher, T. Morato, P.J.B. Hart, M.R. Clark, N. Haggan, and R.S. Santos (eds), ''Fish and Aquatic Resource Series'', Blackwell, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, this knowledge has led to increasing commercial exploitation of seamount fish by the fishing industry, and a number of seamount fish populations have already been depleted.  Part of HERMIONE research will assess the threats and impacts of human activities on seamounts, including comparing data from seamounts in different stages of fisheries exploitation to understand more about the impacts of fishing activities., both on target species and non-target species, and their habitats.

Despite our increasing knowledge on seamounts, there is still very little known about the relationships between their ecosystem functioning and biodiversity, and that of the surrounding areas.  This information is vital in order to improve our understanding of connectivity between seamount hotspots and adjacent areas, and HERMIONE research will aim to discover whether seamounts act as centres of speciation (the evolution of new species), or if they play a role as "stepping stones", allowing fauna to colonise and disperse across the oceans.

=== Chemosynthetic ecosystems ===
Chemosynthetic environments - such as hot vents, cold seeps, mud volcanoes and sulphidic brine pools - show the highest biomass and productivity of all deep-sea ecosystems.  The chemicals found in the fluids, gases and mud that escape from such systems provide an energy source for chemosynthetic bacteria and archaea, which are the primary producers in these systems. A huge variety of fauna profits from the association with chemosynthetic microbes, supporting large communities that can exist independently of sunlight.  Some of these environments, such as methane (cold) seeps, can support up to 50,000 times more biomass than communities that rely on photosynthetic production alone.&lt;ref&gt;Sibuet, M. and Olu-Le Roy, K. (2002)"Cold seep communities on continental margins: Structure and quantitative distribution relative to geological and fluid venting patterns". Pp. 235-251 in ''Ocean Margin Systems'' Wefer, G., Billett, D.S.M., Hebbeln, D., Jorgensen, B.B., Schluter, M. and Van Weering, T.C.M. (eds), Springer Verlag, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the extreme gradients and diversity in physical and chemical factors, hydrothermal vents also remain incredibly fascinating ecosystems. HERMIONE researchers aim to illustrate the tight coupling between geosphere and biosphere processes, as well as their immense heterogeneity and interconnectivity, by observing and comparing the spatial and temporal variation of chemosynthetic environments in European Sea’s.

Methane cycling and carbonate formation by microorganisms in chemosynthetic environments have implications for the control of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;Boetius, A. et al. (2007) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6804/full/407623a0.html "A marine microbial consortium apparently mediating anaerobic oxidation of methane"] ''Nature'' 407, p.623-626, August 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, R.J. et al. (2007) "Biogeochemistry and biodiversity of methane cycling in subsurface marine sediments (Skagerrak, Denmark)" ''Environmental Microbiology'', 9, p.1146-1161&lt;/ref&gt;  Methane can be trapped and stored under the seabed as a gas hydrate, and under different conditions, can either be controlled by microbial consumption, or can escape into the surrounding seawater, and ultimately the atmosphere. Our understanding of the biological controls of methane seepage and feedback mechanisms for global warming is limited. The distribution and structure of cold seep communities can act as an indicator for changes in methane fluxes in the deep sea, e.g. by seafloor warming.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;Niemann H. et al.(2006) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7113/full/nature05227.html "Novel microbial communities of the Haakon Mosby mud volcano and their role as a methane sink"] ''Nature'' 443, p.854-858, August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Using multibeam echosounder data and 3D seismic data with in situ studies at seep sites, and by investigating the life histories of fauna at such ecosystems, HERMIONE scientists aim to understand more about their interconnectivity and resilience, and the implications for climate change.

The great variety of fauna present in chemosynthetic environments is a real challenge to scientists.  Only a tiny fraction of microorganisms at vents and seeps has been identified, and a huge amount is still to be discovered. Their identification, their association with fauna, and the relationship between their diversity, function and habitat, are vital areas of research as biological communities act as important filters, controlling up to 100% of vent and seep emissions.&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;  By using DNA barcoding and genome analysis in addition to traditional methods of identification and experimentation, HERMIONE scientists will study the relationship between community structure and ecosystem functioning at a variety of vents, seeps, brine pools and mud volcanoes.

== Socio-economics, governance and science-policy interfaces ==
With increasing ocean exploration over the last two decades has come the realisation that humans have had an extensive impact on the world’s oceans, not just close to our shores, but also reaching down into the deep sea.  From destructive fishing practices and exploitation of mineral resources to pollution and litter, evidence of human impact can be found in virtually all deep-sea ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, D.M., Collins, M.A., Gordon, J.D.M., Zuur, A.F., and Priede, I.G. (2009) [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1664/1965.full.pdf "Long-term changes in deep-water fish populations in the northeast Atlantic: a deeper reaching effect of fisheries?"]''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'' {{doi|10.1098/rspb.2009.0098}}, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galil, B.S., Golik, A., and Turkay, M. (1995) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V6N-3YMFRG6-3S&amp;_user=126770&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1158904856&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000010399&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=126770&amp;md5=40971b16522441babb3c3589be3dcb8b "Litter at the bottom of the sea: A sea bed survey in the Eastern Mediterranean"] ''Marine Pollution Bulletin'' 30, p22-24, January 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, the international community has set a series of ambitious goals aimed at protecting the marine environment and its resources for future generations.  Three of these initiatives, decided on by world leaders during the [[Earth Summit 2002|2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (Johannesburg), are to achieve a significant reduction in biodiversity loss by 2010, to introduce an ecosystems approach to marine resource assessment and management by 2010, and to designate a network of [[marine protected area]]s by 2012.  A crucial requirement for implementing these is the availability of high-quality scientific data and knowledge, as well as effective [[science policy|science-policy]] interfaces to ensure the policy relevance of research and to enable the rapid translation of scientific information into science policy.

HERMIONE aims to provide this by filling the knowledge gap about threatened deep-sea ecosystems and their current status with respect to anthropogenic impacts (e.g. litter, chemical contamination).  Socio-economists and natural scientists work together in HERMIONE, researching the socio-economics of anthropogenic impacts, mapping human activities that affect the deep sea, assessing the potential for valuing deep-sea ecosystem goods and services, studying governance options and designing and implementing real-time science-policy interfaces.

HERMIONE natural and social science results will provide national, regional (EU), and global policy-makers and other stakeholders with the information needed to establish policies to ensure the sustainable use of the deep ocean and conservation of deep-sea ecosystems.

An '''injection well''' is a device that places fluid deep underground into [[porous rock]] formations, such as sandstone or limestone, or into or below the shallow [[soil]] layer. The fluid may be [[water]], [[wastewater]], [[brine]] (salt water), or water mixed with chemicals.&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC| url=http://www.epa.gov/uic/general-information-about-injection-wells |title=General Information About Injection Wells |date=2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition ==
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defines an injection well as "a bored, drilled, or driven shaft, or a dug hole that is deeper than it is wide, or an improved sinkhole, or a subsurface fluid distribution system".&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt; Well construction depends on the injection fluid injected and depth of the injection zone. Deep wells that are designed to inject [[hazardous wastes]] or carbon dioxide deep below the Earth's surface have multiple layers of protective casing and cement, whereas shallow wells injecting non-hazardous fluids into or above drinking water sources are more simply constructed.&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt;

==Applications==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
Injection wells are used for many purposes.

=== Waste disposal ===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}
{{Expert-subject|Engineering|section|date=July 2010}} 
In [[waste water]] disposal, treated waste water is injected into the ground between [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impermeable]] layers of rocks to avoid polluting [[fresh water]] supplies or adversely affecting quality of receiving waters. Injection wells are usually constructed of solid walled pipe to a deep elevation in order to prevent injectate from mixing with the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt; Unlike outfalls or other direct disposal techniques, injection wells utilize the earth as a filter to further clean the treated wastewater before it reaches the receiving water.  This method of waste water disposal also serves to spread the injectate over a wide area, further decreasing environmental impacts.

Critics of waste water injection wells cite concerns relating to the injectate polluting receiving waters.&lt;ref name="ProPublica-Poison-Beneath"&gt;ProPublica non-profit news agency. New York, NY. [https://www.propublica.org/article/injection-wells-the-poison-beneath-us "Injection Wells: The Poison Beneath Us"] Updated 2014-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most [[environmental engineering]] professionals,{{who|date=September 2013}} however, consider waste water treatment followed by disposal through injection wells to be the most cost effective and environmentally responsible method of waste water treatment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The only known alternatives to injection wells are direct discharge of treated waste water to receiving waters or utilization of the treated water for irrigation. Direct discharge does not disperse the water over a wide area; the environmental impact is focused on a particular segment of a river and its downstream reaches or on a coastal waterbody. Extensive irrigation is often prohibitively expensive and requires ongoing maintenance and large electricity usage.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Since the early 1990s, [[Maui County]], Hawaii has been engaged in a struggle over the 3-5 million gallons per day of wastewater that it injects below the [[Lahaina]] sewage treatment plant, over the claim that the water was emerging in seeps that were causing [[algae bloom]]s and other environmental damage. After some twenty years, it was sued by environmental groups after multiple studies showed that more than half the injectate was appearing in nearby coastal waters. The judge in the suit rejected the County's arguments, potentially subjecting it to millions of dollars in federal fines. A 2001 consent decree required the county to obtain a water quality certification from the Hawaii Department Of Health, which it failed to do until 2010, after the suit was filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilbeat.com/2014/07/federal-judge-rejects-maui-county-arguments-on-lahaina-plant-violations/#comments |title=Federal Judge Rejects Maui County Arguments on Lahaina Plant Violations |publisher=Civil Beat |date= |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil and gas production===
{{see|Enhanced oil recovery|Hydraulic fracturing}}
Another use of injection wells is in [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]] [[Extraction of petroleum|production]]. Steam, [[carbon dioxide]], water, and other substances can be [[water injection (oil production)|injected into an oil-producing unit]] in order to maintain [[petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] pressure, heat the oil or lower its viscosity, allowing it to flow to a producing well nearby.&lt;ref name="EPA Class II"&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/uic/class-ii-oil-and-gas-related-injection-wells "Class II Oil and Gas Related Injection Wells."] Updated 2015-10-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste site remediation===
Yet another use for injection wells is in [[environmental remediation]], for cleanup of either [[soil contamination|soil]] or [[groundwater contamination]].  Injection wells can insert clean water into an [[aquifer]], thereby changing the direction and speed of groundwater flow, perhaps towards [[extraction well]]s downgradient, which could then more speedily and efficiently remove the contaminated groundwater.  Injection wells can also be used in cleanup of soil contamination, for example by use of an ozonation system. Complex [[hydrocarbons]] and other contaminants trapped in soil and otherwise inaccessible can be broken down by [[ozone]], a highly reactive gas, often with greater cost-effectiveness than could be had by digging out the affected area. Such systems are particularly useful in built-up urban environments where digging may be impractical due to overlying buildings.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. New York, NY (2003-04-17). [http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/6427a6b7538955c585257359003f0230/7bfcdcd6fef70da285257163005c159c!OpenDocument "EPA Announces Cleanup Plan for Contaminated Soil and Ground Water at Central Islip Superfund Site."] Example of use of ozonation wells for remediation ''in situ.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquifer recharge===
Recently the option of [[Groundwater recharge|refilling natural aquifers]] with injection or percolation has become more important, particularly in the driest region of the world, the [[MENA]] region (Middle East and North Africa).&lt;ref&gt;H2O magazine (2010-10-16). [http://www.h2ome.net/en/2010/10/strategic-reserve/ "Strategic reserve"] by Anoop K Menon''&lt;/ref&gt;

Surface runoff can also be recharged into [[dry well]]s, or simply barren wells that have been modified to functions as cisterns.&lt;ref&gt;H2O magazine (2011-05-03). [http://www.h2ome.net/en/2011/05/recharging-dry-wells/ "Recharging dry wells."] by Nicol-André Berdellé''&lt;/ref&gt; These hybrid [[stormwater]] management systems, called [[recharge well]]s, have the advantage of aquifer recharge and instantaneous supply of potable water at the same time. They can utilize existing infrastructure and require very little effort for the modification and operation. The activation can be as simple as inserting a polymer cover (foil) into the well shaft. Vertical pipes for conduction of the overflow to the bottom can enhance performance. The area around the well acts as funnel. If this area is maintained well the water will require little purification before it enters the cistern.&lt;ref&gt;Prototype-Creation (2011-04-20). [http://www.prototype-creation.de/recharge_wells.pdf "Recharge wells and ASR."] by Nicol-André Berdellé''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geothermal energy===
Injection wells are used to tap [[geothermal energy]] in hot, porous rock formations below the surface by injecting fluids into the ground, which is heated in the ground, then extracted from adjacent wells as fluid, steam, or a combination of both. The heated steam and fluid can then be utilized [[geothermal power|to generate electricity]] or directly for [[geothermal heating]].&lt;ref name="EERE pamphlet"&gt;{{cite web |title=Geothermal Technologies Program: Tapping the Earth’s energy to meet our heat and power needs |url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/36025.pdf |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy |accessdate=2 June 2018 |format=PDF |date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitch and Matlick 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fitch |first1=David |last2=Matlick |first2=Skip |title=Gold, silver and Other Metals in scale—  Puna Geothermal Venture, Hawaii |journal=GRC  Transactions |date=2008 |volume=32 |pages=385-388 |url=http://pubs.geothermal-library.org/lib/grc/1028353.pdf |accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Direct uses"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gill |first1=Andrea T. |title=Prospective Direct Use Enterprises in Kapoho, Hawaii |url=https://energy.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Prospective-Direct-Use-Enterprises-in-Kapoho-Hawaii.pdf |publisher=Hawaii Dept. of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, Strategic Industries Division |accessdate=2 June 2018 |format=PDF |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory requirements==
In the United States, injection well activity is regulated by EPA and state governments under the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (SDWA).&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt; EPA has issued Underground Injection Control (UIC) regulations in order to protect drinking water sources.&lt;ref name="EPA Regs"&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/uic/underground-injection-control-regulations "Underground Injection Control Regulations."] Updated 2015-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. (July 2001). [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=2000E99H.PDF "Technical Program Overview: Underground Injection Control Regulations."] Document no. EPA 816-R-02-025.&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA regulations define six classes of injection wells. Class I wells are used for the injection of municipal and industrial wastes beneath underground sources of drinking water. Class II wells are used for the injection of fluids associated with oil and gas production, including waste from hydraulic fracturing. Class III wells are used for the injection of fluids used in mineral [[solution mining]] beneath underground sources of drinking water. Class IV wells, like Class I wells, were used for the injection of hazardous wastes but inject waste into or above underground sources of drinking water instead of below. EPA banned the use of Class IV wells in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/uic/class-iv-shallow-hazardous-and-radioactive-injection-wells |title=Class IV Shallow Hazardous and Radioactive Injection Wells |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-09-06 |website=Underground Injection Control |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Class V wells are those used for all non-hazardous injections that are not covered by Classes I through IV. Examples of Class V wells include stormwater drainage wells and [[Septic drain field|septic system leach fields]]. Finally, Class VI wells are used for the injection of carbon dioxide for [[Carbon sequestration|sequestration]], or long term storage.&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt; Currently, there are no Class VI wells in operation, but 6 to 10 wells are expected to be in use by 2016.

==Injection-induced earthquakes==
[[File:Cumulative induced seismicity.png|thumbnail|Cumulative number of earthquakes in the central U.S. The red cluster at the center of the map shows an area near Oklahoma which experienced the largest increase in activity since 2009.]]
{{see also|Induced seismicity#Waste_disposal_wells|label 1=Induced seismicity § Waste disposal wells}}
A July 2013 study by US Geological Survey scientist William Ellsworth links earthquakes to wastewater injection sites. In the four years from 2010-2013 the number of earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater in the central and eastern United States increased dramatically. After decades of a steady earthquake rate (average of 21 events/year), activity increased starting in 2001 and peaked at 188 earthquakes in 2011, including [[2011 Oklahoma earthquake|a record-breaking 5.7-magnitude earthquake]] near [[Prague, Oklahoma]] which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in Oklahoma. USGS scientists have found that at some locations the increase in seismicity coincides with the injection of wastewater in deep disposal wells. Injection-induced earthquakes are thought to be caused by pressure changes due to excess fluid injected deep below the surface and are being dubbed “man-made” earthquakes.&lt;ref name="Man-Made Earthquakes Update"&gt;USGS. [http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/man-made-earthquakes/ "Man-Made Earthquakes Update"] Updated January 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On September&amp;nbsp;3, 2016, [[2016 Oklahoma earthquake|a 5.8-magnitude earthquake]] occurred near [[Pawnee, Oklahoma]], followed by nine aftershocks between magnitudes 2.6 and 3.6 within three and one-half hours. The earthquake broke the previous record set five years earlier. Tremors were felt as far away as [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[Gilbert, Arizona]]. [[Mary Fallin]], the Oklahoma governor, declared a local emergency and shutdown orders for local disposal wells were ordered by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MIDWEST_EARTHQUAKE Record tying Oklahoma earthquake felt as far away as Arizona], ''[[Associated Press]], Ken Miller, September 3, 2016.

Retrieved 4 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Results of ongoing multi-year research on induced earthquakes by the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) published in 2015 suggested that most of the significant earthquakes in Oklahoma, such as the 1952 magnitude 5.5 El Reno earthquake may have been induced by deep injection of waste water by the oil industry.&lt;ref name="usgs_2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=4362#.Vj-sOpTIxku |title=A Century of Induced Earthquakes in Oklahoma? |last1=Hough |first1=Susan E. |last2=Page |first2=Morgan |date=October 20, 2015 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=November 8, 2015 |quote=Several lines of evidence further suggest that most of the significant earthquakes in Oklahoma during the 20th century may also have been induced by oil production activities. Deep injection of waste water, now recognized to potentially induce earthquakes, in fact began in the state in the 1930s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18414">In [[computer science]], '''join-based tree algorithms''' are a class of algorithms for [[self-balancing binary search tree]]s.

The ''join-based algorithms'' can be applied to at least four balancing schemes: [[AVL tree]]s, [[red-black tree]]s, [[weight-balanced tree]]s and [[treap]]s.

The ''join''&lt;math&gt;(L,k,R)&lt;/math&gt; operation takes as input two binary balanced trees &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of the same balancing scheme, and a key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and outputs a new balanced binary tree &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; whose [[Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR)|in-order traversal]] is the in-order traversal of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; then the in-order traversal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if the trees are [[Search tree|search trees]], which means that the in-order of the trees maintain a [[total ordering]] on keys, it must satisfy the condition that all keys in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; are smaller than &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and all keys in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are greater than &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''join'' operation was first defined by Tarjan &lt;ref name="join-tarjan"&gt;{{citation

In 1998, Blelloch and Reid-Miller extended ''join'' on [[treap]]s, and proved the bound of the set functions to be &lt;math&gt;O(m\log (1+\frac{n}{m}))&lt;/math&gt; for two trees of size &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n(\ge m)&lt;/math&gt;, which is optimal in the comparison model. They also brought up parallelism in Adams' algorithm by using a [[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide-and-conquer scheme]]. In 2016, Blelloch et al. formally proposed the join-based algorithms, and formalized the ''join'' algorithm for four different balancing schemes: [[AVL tree]]s, [[red-black tree]]s, [[weight-balanced tree]]s and [[treap]]s. In the same work they proved that Adams' algorithms on union, intersection and difference are work-optimal on all the four balancing schemes.

==Join Algorithms==
The function ''join''&lt;math&gt;(t_1,k,t_2)&lt;/math&gt; considers rebalancing the tree, and thus depends on the input balancing scheme. If the two trees are balanced, ''join'' simply creates a new node with left subtree {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, root {{mvar|k}} and right subtree {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Suppose that {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is heavier (this "heavier" depends on the balancing scheme) than {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} (the other case is symmetric). ''Join'' follows the right spine of {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} until a node {{mvar|c}} which is balanced with {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. At this point a new node with left child {{mvar|c}}, root {{mvar| k}} and right child {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is created to replace c. The new node may invalidate the balancing invariant. This can be fixed with rotations.

The following is the ''join'' algorithms on different balancing schemes.

The [[AVL tree#Set operations and bulk operations|''join'' algorithm for AVL trees]]:

 '''function''' joinRightAVL(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     (l, k', c) = expose(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' (h(c) &lt; h(T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) + 1)
        T'=Node(c, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
        if (h(T') &lt;= h(l) + 1) then '''return''' Node(l, k', T')
        else '''return''' rotateLeft(Node(l, k', rotateRight(T')))
     '''else''' 
         T' = joinRightAVL(c, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
         T'' = Node(l, k', T')
         '''if''' (h(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; h(T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) + 1) '''return''' T''
         '''else''' '''return''' rotateLeft(T'')
 '''function''' joinLeftAVL(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
   /* symmetric to joinRightAVL */
 '''function''' join(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' (h(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; h(T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) + 1) '''return''' joinRightAVL(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' (h(T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; h(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) + 1) '''return''' joinLeftAVL(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''return''' Node(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)

Here &lt;math&gt;h(v)&lt;/math&gt; of a node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; the height of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. expose(v)=(l,k,r) means to extract a tree node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;'s left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, the key of the node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and the right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Node(l,k,r) means to create a node of left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Red-black tree#Set operations and bulk operations|''join'' algorithm for red-black trees]]:

 '''function''' joinRightRB(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' r(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) = ⌊r(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/2⌋ × 2:
         '''return''' Node(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, ⟨k, red⟩, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''else''' 
         (L', ⟨k', c'⟩, R') = expose(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)
         T' = Node(L', ⟨k', c'⟩, joinRightRB(R', k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
         '''if''' (c' = black) and (T'.right.color = T'.right.right.color = red):
              T'.right.right.color = black
              '''return''' rotateLeft(T')
         '''else''' return T'
 '''function''' joinLeftRB(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
   /* symmetric to joinRightRB */
 '''function''' join(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' ⌊r(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/2⌋ &gt; ⌊r(T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)/2⌋ × 2:
        T' = joinRightRB(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
        '''if''' (T'.color = red) and (T'.right.color = red):
           T'.color = black
        return T'
     '''else if''' ⌊r(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/2⌋ &gt; ⌊r(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/2⌋ × 2
        /* symmetric */
     '''else if''' (T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.color = black) and (T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = black)
        Node(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, ⟨k, red⟩, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''else'''
        Node(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, ⟨k, black⟩, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)

Here &lt;math&gt;r(v)&lt;/math&gt; of a node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; means twice the black height of a black node, and the twice the black height of a red node. expose(v)=(l,⟨k,c⟩,r) means to extract a tree node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;'s left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, the key of the node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the color of the node &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and the right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Node(l,⟨k,c⟩,r) means to create a node of left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, color &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Weight-balanced tree#Set operations and bulk operations|''join'' algorithm for weight-balanced trees]]:

 '''function''' joinRightWB(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
    (l, k', c)=expose(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' balance(|T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;|, |T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;|) '''return''' Node(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;,k,T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''else''' 
         T' = joinRightWB(c, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
         (l&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = expose(T')
         '''if''' (balance(l, T')) '''return''' Node(l, k', T')
         '''else if''' (balance(|l|, |l&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|) and balance(|l|+|l&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|, |r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|))
              '''return''' rotateLeft(Node(l, k', T'))
         '''else''' return rotateLeft(Node(l, k', rotateRight(T'))
 '''function''' joinLeftWB(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
   /* symmetric to joinRightWB */
 '''function''' join(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' (heavy(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)) return joinRightWB(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' (heavy(T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)) return joinLeftWB(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)
     Node(T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, k, T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)

Here balance&lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; means two weigthts &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are balanced. expose(v)=(l,k,r) means to extract a tree node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;'s left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, the key of the node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and the right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Node(l,k,r) means to create a node of left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

==Join-based Algorithms==
In the following, expose(v)=(l,k,r) means to extract a tree node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;'s left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, the key of the node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and the right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Node(l,k,r) means to create a node of left child &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and right child &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. right(&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;) and left(&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;) extracts the right child and the left child of a tree node&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. &lt;math&gt;k(v)&lt;/math&gt; extract the key of a node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. "&lt;math&gt;s_1 || s_2&lt;/math&gt;" means that two statements &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; can run in parallel.

===Split===
To split a tree into two trees, those smaller than key ''x'', and those larger than key ''x'', we first draw a path from the root by inserting ''x'' into the tree. After this insertion, all values less than ''x'' will be found on the left of the path, and all values greater than ''x'' will be found on the right. By applying ''Join'', all the subtrees on the left side are merged bottom-up using keys on the path as intermediate nodes from bottom to top to form the left tree, and the right part is asymmetric. For some applications, ''Split'' also returns a boolean value denoting if ''x'' appears in the tree. The cost of ''Split'' is &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt;, order of the height of the tree. 

The split algorithm is as follows:

 '''function''' split(T,k)
     '''if''' (T=nil) return (nil,false,nil)
     (L,(m,c),R)=expose(T)
     '''if''' (k=m) return (L,true,R)
     '''if''' (k&lt;m) 
        (L',b,R')=split(L,k)
        '''return''' (L',b,join(R',m,R))
     '''if''' (k&gt;m) 
        (L',b,R')=split(R,k)
        '''return''' (join(L,m,L'),b,R))

===Join2===
This function is defined similarly as ''join'' but without the middle key. It first splits out the last key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of the left tree, and then join the rest part of the left tree with the right tree with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
The algorithm is as follows:

 '''function''' splitLast(T)
    (L,k,R)=expose(T)
     '''if''' (R=nil) '''return''' (L,k)
     (T',k')=splitLast(R)
     '''return''' (join(L,k,T'),k')
 '''function''' join2(L,R)
     '''if''' (L=nil) '''return''' R
     (L',k)=splitLast(L)
     '''return''' join(L',k,R)

The cost is &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; for a tree of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

===Insert and Delete===
The insertion and deletion algorithms, when making use of ''join'' can be independent of balancing schemes. For an insertion, the algorithm compares the key to be inserted with the key in the root, inserts it to the left/right subtree if the key is smaller/greater than the key in the root, and joins the two subtrees back with the root. A deletion compares the key to be deleted with the key in the root. If they are equal, return join2 on the two subtrees. Otherwise, delete the key from the corresponding subtree, and join the two subtrees back with the root.
The algorithms are as follows:

 '''function''' insert(T,k)
    if (T=nil) '''return''' Node(nil,k,nil)
    (L,k',R)=expose(T)
     '''if''' (k&lt;k') '''return''' join(insert(L,k),k',R)
     '''if''' (k&gt;k') '''return''' join(L,k,insert(R,k))
 '''function''' delete(T,k)
    if (T=nil) '''return''' nil
    (L,k',R)=expose(T)
     '''if''' (k&lt;k') '''return''' join(delete(L,k),k',R)
     '''if''' (k&gt;k') '''return''' join(L,k',delete(R,k))
     return join2(L,R)

Both insertion and deletion requires &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; time if &lt;math&gt;|T|=n&lt;/math&gt;.

===Set-Set Functions===
Several set operations have been defined on weight-balanced trees: [[Union (set theory)|union]], [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[set difference]]. The union of two weight-balanced trees {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} representing sets {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}}, is a tree {{mvar|''t''}} that represents {{math|''A'' ∪ ''B''}}. The following recursive function computes this union:

 '''function''' union(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):
     '''if''' t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = nil:
         '''return''' t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
     '''if''' t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = nil:
         '''return''' t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
     (t&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&lt;/sub&gt;, b, t&lt;sub&gt;&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) = split t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.root
     nl=union(left(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), t&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&lt;/sub&gt;) || nr = union(right(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), t&lt;sub&gt;&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''return''' join(nl, t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.root, nr)

Similarly, the algorithms of intersection and set-difference are as follows:

 '''function''' intersection(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):
     '''if''' (t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = nil or t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = nil) '''return''' nil
     (t&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&lt;/sub&gt;, b, t&lt;sub&gt;&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) = split t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.root
     nl = t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.root, intersection(left(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) || nr = intersection(right(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), t&lt;sub&gt;&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if'''  (b) '''return''' join(nl, t&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&lt;/sub&gt;), nr)
     '''else''' '''return''' join2(nl, nr)
 '''function''' difference(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):
     '''if''' (t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = nil) '''return''' nil
     '''if''' (t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = nil) '''return''' t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
     (t&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&lt;/sub&gt;, b, t&lt;sub&gt;&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) = split t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.root
     nl = difference(left(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), t&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&lt;/sub&gt;) || nr = difference(right(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), t&lt;sub&gt;&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''return''' join2(nl, nr)

The complexity of each of union, intersection and difference is &lt;math&gt;O\left(m \log \left({n\over m}+1\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt; for two weight-balanced trees of sizes &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n(\ge m)&lt;/math&gt;. This complexity is optimal in terms of the number of comparisons. More importantly, since the recursive calls to union, intersection or difference are independent of each other, they can be executed [[parallel programming|in parallel]] with a [[Analysis of parallel algorithms|parallel depth]] &lt;math&gt;O(\log m\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="join-based"/&gt; When &lt;math&gt;m=1&lt;/math&gt;, the join-based implementation applies the same computation as in a single-element insertion or deletion if the root of the larger tree is used to split the smaller tree.

===Build===
The algorithm for building a tree can make use of the union algorithm, and use the divide-and-conquer scheme:

 '''function''' build(A[], n):
     '''if''' (n=0) '''return''' nil
     '''if''' (n=1) '''return''' Node(nil,A[0],nil)
     L = build(A,n/2) || R = (A+n/2, n-n/2)
     '''return''' union(L,R)

This algorithm costs &lt;math&gt;O(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt; work and has &lt;math&gt;O(\log^3 n)&lt;/math&gt; depth. A more-efficient algorithm makes use of a parallel sorting algorithm.

 '''function''' buildSorted(A[], n):
     '''if''' (n=0) '''return''' nil
     '''if''' (n=1) '''return''' Node(nil,A[0],nil)
     L = build(A,n/2) || R = (A+n/2+1, n-n/2-1)
     '''return''' join(L,A[n/2],R)
 '''function''' build(A[], n):
     A'=sort(A,n)
     '''return''' buildSorted(A,n)

This algorithm costs &lt;math&gt;O(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt; work and has &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; depth assuming the sorting algorithm has &lt;math&gt;O(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt; work and &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; depth.

===Filter===
This function selects all entries in a tree satisfying an indicator &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, and return a tree containing all selected entries. It recursively filters the two subtrees, and join them with the root if the root satisfies &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise ''join2'' the two subtrees.

 '''function''' filter(T,f):
     '''if''' (T=nil) '''return''' nil
     L = filter(left(T),f) || R = (right(T),f)
     '''if''' (f(k(T)) '''return''' join(L,k(T),R)
     '''else''' '''return''' join2(L,R)

This algorithm costs work &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; and depth &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; on a tree of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, assuming &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has constant cost.

[[File:Le Ménestrel 1st Edition - 1 December 1833.jpg|thumb|242 px|Front page of the first edition of ''Le Ménestrel'' (1 December 1833)]]
'''''Le Ménestrel''''' (The Minstrel) was an influential French music journal published weekly from 1833 until 1940. It was founded by Joseph-Hippolyte l'Henry and originally printed by Poussièlgue. In 1840 it was acquired by the music publishers [[Éditions Alphonse Leduc#Heugel|Heugel]] and remained with the company until the journal's demise at the beginning of World War II. With the closure of its chief rival, ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris|La Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]'' in 1880, ''Le Ménestrel'' became France's most prestigious and longest-running music journal.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2007) pp. 2 and 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
In 1827 [[François-Joseph Fétis]] had founded ''La Revue Musicale'', France's first periodical devoted entirely to classical music. By 1834 it had two serious competitors, ''Le Ménestrel'' established in 1833 and [[Maurice Schlesinger]]'s ''Gazette Musicale'' established in 1834. ''Le Ménestrel'' was founded by the Paris publisher Joseph-Hippolyte l'Henry, with the first edition (printed by Poussièlgue) appearing on 1 December 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Gautier (1995) p. 156; ''Le Ménestrel'' (1 December 1833)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1835, Schlesinger bought ''La Revue Musicale'' from Fétis and merged the two journals into ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris|La Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]''. Until ''La Revue et Gazette'' ceased publication in 1880, ''Le Ménestrel'' was to be its main rival in terms of influence and breadth of coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2007) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

E. D'Arlhac took over the directorship of ''Le Ménestrel'' in July 1835, but relinquished it the following March to the journalist and critic [[Jules Lovy]], who had been a writer for the journal since its foundation. By 1836 ''Le Ménestrel'' had a weekly print run of 600 copies, although as [[Katharine Ellis]] points out, the number of actual readers was probably much larger. At the time, Paris alone had over 500 ''[[cabinet de lecture|cabinets de lecture]]'', private reading rooms and precursors to the modern library popular in early 19th century France where for a small fee the public could read the latest issues of newspapers and journals.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2007) pp. 1-2 and 268-269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. Books: A Living History. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum, 2011. p.105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, Harry Earl. The "Cabinet de Lecture" in France, 1800-1850. The Library Quarterly, 48(1). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, the newly formed music publishing partnership of [[Jacques-Léopold Heugel]] and [[Jean-Antoine Meissonnier]] acquired ''Le Ménestrel''. Heugel became the director, and Jules Lovy stayed on as editor-in-chief until his death in 1863. Lovy was succeeded by the critic and music historian [[Joseph d'Ortigue]]. Later editors-in-chief included [[Arthur Pougin]] who served from 1885 to 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; However, after d'Ortigue's death in 1866, only the Heugel name appeared on the [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]]. When Jacques-Léopold died in 1883, his son Henri-Georges Heugel took over as director. He was in turn succeeded by his own son Jacques-Paul who served as the director for the remainder of the journal's existence.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Ménestrel'' (3 February 1933) p. 52; Feurzeig (1994) p. 126; Nichols and Drake (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Le Ménestrel'' was published weekly for a period spanning 107 years, initially coming out on Sunday (later changed to Saturday and then Friday). The [[Franco-Prussian War]] caused publication to be suspended from late December 1870 through November 1871, and publication was suspended again for the duration of [[World War I]], with the first post-war issue appearing on 17 October 1919. At the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, the journal carried on until the invasion of France. The 24 May 1940 issue announced that following the German attacks and the closure of theatres and concert halls in Europe and France as well as the [[Paris Conservatory]], the journal was suspending publication with the hope of resuming in the autumn.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Ménestrel'' (24 May 1940). Original text: "Nous souhaitons pouvoir reprendre, à l'automne, l'effort que nous nous sommes imposé pendant la première phase de la guerre, conscients d'avoir ainsi servi modestement, mais de notre mieux, la cause impérissable de la pensée et de l'art français."&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, it proved to be the last issue of ''Le Ménestrel''. The Heugel company continued to operate as an independent music publisher until 1980 when it was sold to [[Éditions Alphonse Leduc]].

Notable people who wrote for the journal include [[Henri Duponchel]], [[Max d'Ollone]], [[Alphonse Royer]] and [[Paul Collin]].

A '''hypothetical Solar System object''' is a [[planet]], [[natural satellite]], [[moonmoon]] or similar body in the [[Solar System]] whose existence is not known, but has been inferred from observational scientific evidence. Over the years a number of hypothetical planets have been proposed, and many have been disproved. However, even today there is scientific speculation about the possibility of planets yet unknown that may exist beyond the range of our current knowledge.

==Planets==
*[[Counter-Earth]], a planet situated on the other side of the Sun from that of the Earth. 
*[[Fifth planet (hypothetical)]], historical speculation about a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
**[[Phaeton (hypothetical planet)|Phaeton]], a planet situated between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]] whose destruction supposedly led to the formation of the [[asteroid belt]]. These days, this hypothesis is considered unlikely, since the asteroid belt has far too little mass to have resulted from the explosion of a large planet.
** [[Planet V]], a planet thought by [[John Chambers (scientist)|John Chambers]] and [[Jack Lissauer]] to have once existed between [[Mars]] and the [[asteroid belt]], based on computer simulations.
* [[Planet Nine]], a planet proposed to explain apparent alignments in the orbits of a number of distant trans-Neptunian objects. 
* [[Planet X]], a hypothetical planet beyond [[Neptune]]. Initially employed to account for supposed [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] (systematic deviations) in the orbits of [[Uranus]] and Neptune, belief in its existence ultimately inspired the search for [[Pluto]]. Though the concept has since been abandoned following more precise measurements of Neptune's mass, which accounted for all observed perturbations, it has been re-applied to account for supposed deviations in the motions  of [[Kuiper Belt|Kuiper belt]] objects. Such explanations are still controversial, however. 
* [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], a Mars-sized impactor believed to have collided with the Earth roughly 4.5 billion years ago; an event which created the [[Moon]].
* [[Vulcan (hypothetical planet)|Vulcan]], a hypothetical planet once believed to exist inside the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. Initially proposed as the cause for the perturbations in the orbit of Mercury, some astronomers spent many years searching for it, with many instances of people claiming to have found it. The perturbations in Mercury's orbit were later accounted for via Einstein's [[General Theory of Relativity]]. 
** [[Vulcanoid]]s, asteroids that may exist within a gravitationally stable region inside Mercury's orbit.
*[[Tyche (hypothetical planet)|Tyche]], a hypothetical planet in the [[Oort Cloud]] supposedly responsible for producing the statistical excess in long period [[comet]]s in a band.&lt;ref&gt; The Independent, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/up-telescope-search-begins-for-giant-new-planet-2213119.html "Up telescope!

* [[Mercury's moon]], hypothesised to account for an unusual pattern of radiation detected by ''[[Mariner 10]]'' in the vicinity of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. Subsequent data from the mission revealed the actual source to be the star [[31 Crateris]].
* [[Neith (hypothetical moon)|Neith]], a purported moon of [[Venus]], falsely detected by a number of telescopic observers in the 17th and 18th centuries. Now known not to exist, the object has been explained as a series of misidentified stars and internal reflections inside the optics of particular telescope designs.
* [[Themis (hypothetical moon)|Themis]], a moon of Saturn which astronomer [[William Henry Pickering|William Pickering]] claimed to have discovered in 1905, but which was never seen again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nineplanets.org/hypo.html#sat Hypothetical Planets&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Star==
* [[Nemesis (hypothetical star)|Nemesis]], a [[brown dwarf|brown ]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;or [[red dwarf]] whose existence was suggested in 1984 by physicist [[Richard A. Muller]], based on purported periodicities in [[mass extinction]]s within Earth's fossil record. Its regular passage through the Solar System's [[Oort cloud]] would send large numbers of comets towards Earth, massively increasing the chances of an impact. Also believed to be the cause of minor planet [[90377 Sedna|Sedna's]] unusual elongated orbit. The existence of the [[Nemesis (hypothetical star)|Nemesis]] in the modern Solar system was ruled out in 2014 after the infrared survey performed by [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]] spacecraft found no [[brown dwarf]] up to {{conv|10000|au|ly}} from Sun.

A '''mating system''' is a way in which a group is structured in relation to sexual behaviour. The precise meaning depends upon the context. With respect to [[animals]], the term describes which males and females [[mating|mate]], under which circumstances; recognised systems include [[monogamy]], [[polygamy]] (which includes [[polygyny]], [[polyandry]], and [[polygynandry]]), and [[promiscuity]], all of which lead to different [[mate choice]] outcomes and thus these systems affect how [[sexual selection]] works in the species which practice them. In plants, the term refers to the degree and circumstances of [[outcrossing]]. In human [[sociobiology]], the terms have been extended to encompass the formation of relationships such as [[marriage]].

==In plants==
{{See also|Plant reproduction}}
The primary mating systems in plants are [[outcrossing]] (cross-fertilisation), [[autogamy]] (self-fertilisation) and [[apomixis]] (asexual reproduction without fertilization, but only when arising by modification of sexual function). Mixed mating systems, in which plants use two or even all three mating systems, are not uncommon.&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"&gt;{{cite book | author = Brown, A. H. D.| year = 1989 | chapter = Isozyme analysis of plant mating systems |editor1=Soltis, D. E. |editor2=[[Soltis, P. S.]] | title = Isozymes in Plant Biology | pages = 73–86 | publisher = Dioscorides Press | location = Portland|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of models have been used to describe the parameters of plant mating systems. The basic model is the [[mixed mating model]], which is based on the assumption that every fertilisation is either self-fertilisation or completely random cross-fertilisation. More complex models relax this assumption; for example, the [[effective selfing model]] recognises that mating may be more common between pairs of closely related plants than between pairs of distantly related plants.&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"/&gt;

==In animals==

{{See also|Animal sexual behaviour#Mating systems|Polygyny threshold model|Monogamous pairing in animals}}
The following are some of the mating systems generally recognized in animals:
*[[Monogamy]]: One male and one female have an exclusive mating relationship. The term "[[pair bond]]ing" often implies this. This is associated with one-male, one-female group compositions. There are two types of monogamy: type 1, which is facultative, and type 2, which is obligate. Facultative monogamy occurs when there are very low densities in a species. This means that mating occurs with only a single member of the opposite sex because males and females are very far apart. When a female needs aid from conspecifics in order to have a litter this is obligate monogamy. However, with this, the habitat carrying capacity is small so it means only one female can breed within the habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kleiman | first1 = Devra G | year = 1977 | title = Monogamy in Mammals | url = | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 39–69 | doi = 10.1086/409721 | pmid = 857268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Polygamy]]: Three types are recognized:
**[[Polygyny in nature|Polygyny]] (the most common polygamous mating system in [[vertebrates]] so far studied): One male has an exclusive relationship with two or more females. This is associated with one-male, multi-female group compositions. Many perennial ''[[Vespula squamosa ]]'' (southern yellowjacket) colonies are polygynous.&lt;ref&gt;Pickett, K. M., Osborne, D. M., Wahl, D., and Wenzel, J. W. (2001). "An Enormous Nest of Vespula squamosa from Florida, the Largest Social Was Nest Reported from North America, with Notes on Colony Cycle and Reproduction", "Journal of the New York Entomological Society", 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of polygyny exist, such as lek polygyny and resource defense polygyny. Grayling butterflies (''[[Grayling (butterfly)|Hipparchia semele]]'') engage in resource defense polygyny, where females choose a territorial male based on the best oviposition site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dreisig|first=H.|date=1995-02-01|title=Thermoregulation and flight activity in territorial male graylings, Hipparchia semele (Satyridae), and large skippers, Ochlodes venata (Hesperiidae)|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=101|issue=2|pages=169–176|doi=10.1007/BF00317280|pmid=28306787|issn=0029-8549|bibcode=1995Oecol.101..169D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most animals opt for only one of these strategies, some exhibit hybrid strategies, such as the bee species, ''[[Xylocopa micans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Change in mandibular and mesosomal gland contents of maleXylocopa micans (Hymenoptera: Anthophoridae) associated with mating system|journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology|date = 1990-06-01|issn = 0098-0331|pages = 1877–1885|volume = 16|issue = 6|doi = 10.1007/BF01020501|pmid = 24263991|first = H. J.|last = McAuslane|first2 = S. B.|last2 = Vinson|first3 = H. J.|last3 = Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
**[[Polyandry in nature|Polyandry]]: One female has an exclusive relationship with two or more males. This is very rare and is associated with multi-male, multi-female group compositions. Genetic polyandry is found some insect species such as [[Western Honey Bee|''Apis mellifera'']] (the Western Honey Bee), in which a virgin queen will mate with multiple drones during her nuptial flight whereas each drone will die immediately upon mating once. The queen will then store the sperm collected from these multiple matings in her spermatheca to use to fertilize eggs throughout the course of her entire reproductive life.
**[[Polygynandry]]: Polygynandry is a slight variation of this, where two or more males have an exclusive relationship with two or more females; the numbers of males and females don't have to be equal, and in vertebrate species studied so far, the number of males is usually less. This is associated with multi-male, multi-female group compositions.
*[[Promiscuity]]: A member of one sex within the social group mates with any member of the opposite sex. This is associated with multi-male, multi-female group compositions.

These mating relationships may or may not be associated with social relationships, in which the sexual partners stay together to become parenting partners. As the alternative term "pair bonding" implies, this is usual in monogamy. In many polyandrous systems, the males and the female stay together to rear the young. In polygynous systems where the number of females paired with each male is low and the male will often stay with one female to help rear the young, while the other females rear their young on their own. In polygynandry, each of the males may assist one female; if all adults help rear all the young, the system is more usually called "[[communal breeding]]". In highly polygynous systems, and in promiscuous systems, paternal care of young is rare, or there may be no parental care at all.

These descriptions are idealized, and the social partnerships are often easier to observe than the mating relationships. In particular:
*the relationships are rarely exclusive for all individuals in a species. [[DNA fingerprinting]] studies have shown that even in pair-bonding, matings outside the pair (extra-pair copulations) occur with fair frequency, and a significant minority of offspring result from them. However, the offspring that are a result of extra-pair copulations usually exhibit more advantageous genes. These genes can be associated with improvements in appearance, mating, and the functioning of internal body systems.&lt;ref name="Bekoff"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior|last1=Bekoff|first1=Marc|date=2004|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-32747-6|location=Westport|pages=889–891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310505282|title=Female Sneak Copulation: In: Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Psychological Science|last=Howie|first=James|date=January 2017|website=Researchgate|access-date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*some species show different mating systems in different circumstances, for example in different parts of their geographical range, or under different conditions of food availability
*mixtures of the simple systems described above may occur.

[[Sexual conflict|Sexual Conflict]] occurs between individuals of different sexes that have separate or conflicting requirements for optimal mating success. This conflict may lead to competitive adaptations and co-adaptations of one or both of the sexes to maintain mating processes that are beneficial to that sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=G.

===In humans===
{{See also|Monogamy|Polygyny|Polyandry|Polyamory}}
Compared to other [[vertebrate]]s, where a species usually has a single mating system, human display great variety. Humans also differ by having formal [[marriage]]s which in some cultures involve negotiation and arrangement between elder relatives. Regarding sexual dimorphism (see the section about animals above), humans are in the intermediate group with moderate sex differences in body size but with relatively large testes. This indicates relatively frequent sperm competition which is supported by reports of extrapair paternity of 2–22% in socially monogamous and polygynous human societies. One estimate is that 83% of human societies are polygynous, 0.05% are polyandrous, and the rest are monogamous. Even the last group may at least in part be genetically polygynous.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 30 Ecological and socio-cultural impacts on mating and marriage systems by Bobbi S. Low&lt;/ref&gt;

From an evolutionary standpoint,  females are more prone to practice [[monogamy]] because their reproductive success is based on the resources she is able to acquire through reproduction rather than the quantity of offspring she produces. However, men are more likely to practice [[polygamy]] because his reproductive success is based on the amount of offsprings he produces, rather than any kind of benefit from parental investment.&lt;ref name="Cartwright 2002 19"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolutionary Explanations of Human Behaviour|last=Cartwright|first=John. H|publisher=Taylor and Franis e-Library|year=2002|isbn=978-0-203-47064-0|location=New York, NY|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polygyny is associated with an increased sharing of subsistence provided by women. This is consistent with the theory that if women raise the children alone, men can concentrate on the mating effort. Polygyny is also associated with greater environmental variability in the form of variability of [[rainfall]]. This may increase the differences in the resources available to men. An important association is that polygyny is associated with a higher [[pathogen]] load in an area which may make having good genes in a male increasingly important. A high pathogen load also decreases the relative importance of [[sororal polygyny]] which may be because it becomes increasingly important to have genetic variability in the offspring (See [[Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection]]).&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt;

Virtually all the terms used to describe animal mating systems were adopted from [[social anthropology]], where they had been devised to describe systems of [[marriage]]. This shows that human sexual behavior is unusually flexible since, in most animal species, one mating system dominates. While there are close analogies between animal mating systems and human marriage institutions, these analogies should not be pressed too far, because in human societies, marriages typically have to be recognized by the entire social group in some way, and there is no equivalent process in animal societies. The temptation to draw conclusions about what is "natural" for human sexual behavior from observations of animal mating systems should be resisted: a socio-biologist observing the kinds of behavior shown by humans in any other species would conclude that all known mating systems were natural for that species, depending on the circumstances or on individual differences.&lt;ref name="Cartwright 2002 19"/&gt;

As culture increasingly affects human mating choices, ascertaining what is the 'natural' mating system of the human animal from a zoological perspective becomes increasingly difficult. Some clues can be taken from human anatomy, which is essentially unchanged from the prehistoric past:

*humans have a large relative size of testes to body mass in comparison to most primates;
*humans have a large ejaculate volume and sperm count in comparison to other primates;
*as compared to most primates, humans spend more time in copulation;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bonobo-sex-and-society-2006-06/|title=Bonobo Sex and Society: The behavior of a close relative challenges assumptions about male supremacy in human evolution|last=De Waal|first=Frans|date=March 1996|website=Scientific American|access-date=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*as compared to most primates, humans [[copulate]] with greater frequency;
*the outward signs of [[Estrous cycle|estrous]] in women (i.e. higher body temperature, breast swelling, sugar cravings, etc.), are often perceived to be less obvious in comparison to the outward signs of ovulation in most other mammals;
*for most mammals, the estrous cycle and its outward signs bring on mating activity; the majority of female-initiated matings in humans coincides with estrous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beach|first1=Frank|title=Sexual attractivity, proceptivity, and receptivity in female mammals|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=1976|volume=7|issue=1|pages=105–138|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0018506X76900088|accessdate=20 October 2017|doi=10.1016/0018-506x(76)90008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but humans copulate throughout the reproductive cycle;

Some have suggested that these anatomical factors signify some degree of [[sperm competition]], though as levels of genetic and societal promiscuity are highly varied across cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://raptor1.bizlab.mtsu.edu/s-drive/TEFF/662/papers2010/men_dominance/The%20Mating%20System%20of%20Foragers%20in%20the%20Standard%20Cross-Cultural%20Sample.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302125838/http://raptor1.bizlab.mtsu.edu/s-drive/TEFF/662/papers2010/men_dominance/The%20Mating%20System%20of%20Foragers%20in%20the%20Standard%20Cross-Cultural%20Sample.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; this evidence is far from conclusive.

==In microorganisms==

===Bacteria===

Mating in [[bacteria]] involves transfer of DNA from one cell to another and incorporation of the transferred DNA into the recipient bacteria’s [[genome]] by [[homologous recombination]].  Transfer of DNA between bacterial cells can occur in three main ways.  First, a bacterium can take up [[exogenous DNA]] released into the intervening medium from another bacterium by a process called [[Transformation (genetics)|'''transformation''']].  DNA can also be transferred from one bacterium to another by the process of [[Transduction (genetics)|'''transduction''']], which is mediated by an infecting virus (bacteriophage).  The third method of DNA transfer is [[Bacterial conjugation|''conjugation'']], in which a [[plasmid]] mediates transfer through direct cell contact between cells.

Transformation, unlike transduction or conjugation, depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process,&lt;ref name="pmid15083159"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen I, Dubnau D |title=DNA uptake during bacterial transformation |journal=Nat. Rev. Microbiol. |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=241–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15083159 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro844 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial [[adaptation]] for DNA transfer.  In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed [[natural competence]].  In ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' about 40 genes are required for the development of competence and DNA uptake.&lt;ref name="pmid8901420"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Solomon JM, Grossman AD |title=Who's competent and when: regulation of natural genetic competence in bacteria |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=150–5 |year=1996 |pmid=8901420 |doi= 10.1016/0168-9525(96)10014-7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The length of DNA transferred during ''B. subtilis'' transformation can be as much as a third and up to the whole chromosome.&lt;ref name="pmid11388459"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akamatsu T, Taguchi H |title=Incorporation of the whole chromosomal DNA in protoplast lysates into competent cells of Bacillus subtilis |journal=Biosci.

===Archaea===

In several species of [[archaea]], mating is mediated by formation of cellular aggregates.
''[[Halobacterium]] volcanii'', an extreme [[Halophile|halophilic]] archaeon, forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells that appear to be used for transfer of DNA from one cell to another in either direction.&lt;ref name="pmid2818746"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosenshine I, Tchelet R, Mevarech M |title=The mechanism of DNA transfer in the mating system of an archaebacterium |journal=Science |volume=245 |issue=4924 |pages=1387–9 |year=1989 |pmid=2818746 |doi= 10.1126/science.2818746|url=|bibcode=1989Sci...245.1387R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggregation in ''S. solfataricus'' could not be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift,&lt;ref name=Frol /&gt; suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by DNA damage.  Ajon et al.&lt;ref name=Ajon /&gt; showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in ''S. acidocaldarius''.  Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude.  Frols et al.&lt;ref name=Frol /&gt; and Ajon et al.&lt;ref name=Ajon /&gt; hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species-specific DNA transfer between ''Sulfolobus'' cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of [[homologous recombination]]. This response appears to be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.&lt;ref name=Bernstein13&gt;Bernstein H and Bernstein C (2013).

===Protists===

Protists are a large group of diverse [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s, mainly [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] animals and plants, that do not form [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Eukaryotes emerged in evolution more than 1.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="pmid11452306"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Javaux EJ, Knoll AH, Walter MR |title=Morphological and ecological complexity in early eukaryotic ecosystems |journal=Nature |volume=412 |issue=6842 |pages=66–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11452306 |doi=10.1038/35083562 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest eukaryotes were likely protists.  Mating and [[sexual reproduction]] are widespread among extant eukaryotes. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, Dacks and Roger&lt;ref name="pmid10229582"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dacks J, Roger AJ |title=The first sexual lineage and the relevance of facultative sex |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=779–83 |year=1999 |pmid=10229582 |doi= 10.1007/pl00013156|url=|bibcode=1999JMolE..48..779D }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that facultative sex was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes.

However, to many biologists it seemed unlikely until recently, that mating and sex could be a primordial and fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes. A principal reason for this view was that mating and sex appeared to be lacking in certain [[pathogen]]ic protists whose ancestors branched off early from the eukaryotic family tree.  However, several of these protists are now known to be capable of, or to recently have had, the capability for [[meiosis]] and hence mating. To cite one example, the common intestinal parasite ''[[Giardia lamblia|Giardia intestinalis]]'' was once considered to be a descendant of a protist lineage that predated the emergence of meiosis and sex.  However, ''G. intestinalis'' was recently found to have a core set of genes that function in meiosis and that are widely present among sexual eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid15668177"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramesh MA, Malik SB, Logsdon JM |title=A phylogenomic inventory of meiotic genes; evidence for sex in Giardia and an early eukaryotic origin of meiosis |journal=Curr.

Furthermore, direct evidence for meiotic recombination, indicative of mating and sexual reproduction, was also found in ''G. intestinalis''.&lt;ref name="pmid17980591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper MA, Adam RD, Worobey M, Sterling CR |title=Population genetics provides evidence for recombination in Giardia |journal=Curr.

Protists generally reproduce asexually under favorable environmental conditions, but tend to reproduce sexually under stressful conditions, such as starvation or heat shock.&lt;ref name=Bernstein13 /&gt;

===Viruses===

Both animal viruses and bacterial viruses ([[bacteriophage]]) are able to undergo mating.  When a cell is mixedly infected by two genetically marked viruses, recombinant virus progeny are often observed indicating that mating interaction had occurred at the DNA level.  Another manifestation of mating between viral genomes is multiplicity reactivation (MR).  MR is the process by which at least two virus genomes, each containing inactivating genome damage, interact with each other in an infected cell to form viable progeny viruses.  The genes required for MR in bacteriophage T4 are largely the same as the genes required for allelic recombination.&lt;ref name="pmid6261109"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernstein C |title=Deoxyribonucleic acid repair in bacteriophage |journal=Microbiol. Rev. |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=72–98 |year=1981 |pmid=6261109 |pmc=281499 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of MR in animal viruses are described in the articles ''[[Herpes simplex virus]]'', ''[[Influenza A virus]]'', ''[[Adenoviridae]]'', ''[[Simian virus 40]]'', ''[[Vaccinia virus]]'', and ''[[Reoviridae]]''.

The '''medieval art''' of the [[Western world]] covers a vast scope of time and place, over 1000 years of art in [[Western art history|Europe]], and at times the Middle East and North Africa. It includes major art movements and periods, national and regional art, genres, revivals, the artists' crafts, and the artists themselves.

Art historians attempt to classify medieval art into major periods and styles, often with some difficulty.  A generally accepted scheme includes the later phases of [[Early Christian art]], [[Migration Period art]], [[Byzantine art]], [[Insular art]], [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]], [[Romanesque art]], and [[Gothic art]], as well as many other periods within these central styles. In addition each region, mostly during the period in the process of becoming  [[nation]]s or cultures, had its own distinct artistic style, such as [[Anglo-Saxon art]] or [[Norse art]].

Medieval art was produced in many media, and works survive in large numbers in [[sculpture]], [[illuminated manuscript]]s, [[stained glass]], [[metalwork]] and [[mosaic]]s, all of which have had a higher survival rate than other media such as [[fresco]] wall-paintings, work in precious metals or [[History of clothing and textiles#Medieval clothing and textiles|textile]]s, including [[tapestry]].  Especially in the early part of the period, works in the so-called "minor arts" or [[decorative arts]], such as metalwork, ivory carving, [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[embroidery]] using precious metals, were probably more highly valued than paintings or [[monumental sculpture]].&lt;ref&gt;Heslop traces the beginning of the change to "around the twelfth century", quoted, 54; Zarnecki, 234&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval art in Europe grew out of the artistic heritage of the [[Roman art|Roman Empire]] and the [[Christian iconography|iconographic traditions]] of the [[early Christian church]]. These sources were mixed with the vigorous "barbarian" artistic culture of Northern Europe to produce a remarkable artistic legacy. Indeed, the history of medieval art can be seen as the history of the interplay between the elements of [[classical art|classical]], early Christian and "barbarian" art.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger (throughout), Hinks (especially Part 1) and Henderson (Chapters 1, 2 &amp; 4) in particular are concerned with this perennial theme. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDNobJFWygcC&amp;pg=PA407&amp;lpg=PA407&amp;dq=Medieval+art+classical+barbarian+Gardner's&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AUZrn-wyQw&amp;sig=y2nS9GdW5mslQ8b5r7aRRr4119s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=m5KBStT8HIy5jAfaocSKCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the formal aspects of classicism, there was a continuous tradition of realistic depiction of objects that survived in Byzantine art throughout the period, while in the West it appears intermittently, combining and sometimes competing with new expressionist possibilities developed in Western Europe and the Northern legacy of energetic decorative elements.  The period ended with the self-perceived [[Renaissance]] recovery of the skills and values of classical art, and the artistic legacy of the [[Middle Ages]] was then [[Dark Ages (historiography)|disparaged]] for some centuries.  Since a revival of interest and understanding in the 19th century it has been seen as a period of enormous achievement that underlies the development of later Western art.

==Overview==

[[File:Lorenzetti amb.effect2.jpg|thumb|400px|Detail of ''The Effects of Good Government'', a [[fresco]] in the [[Palazzo Pubblico|City Hall of Siena]] by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]], 1338.]]

The [[Middle Ages]] in Europe saw a decrease in prosperity, stability, and population in the first centuries of the period—to about 800 AD, and then a fairly steady and general increase until the massive setback of the [[Black Death]] around 1350, which is estimated to have killed at least a third of the overall population in Europe, with generally higher rates in the south and lower in the north.  Many regions did not regain their former population levels until the 17th century.  The [[Medieval demographics|population of Europe]] is estimated to have reached a low point of about 18 million in 650, to have doubled around the year 1000, and to have reached over 70 million by 1340, just before the Black Death. In 1450 it was still only 50 million. To these figures, Northern Europe, especially Britain, contributed a lower proportion than today, and Southern Europe, including France, a higher one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html Fordham University] Josiah Russell's figures - all estimates are of course very imprecise.  See [[Consequences of the Black Death]] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;  The increase in prosperity, for those who survived, was much less affected by the Black Death. Until about the 11th century most of Europe was short of agricultural labour, with large amounts of unused land, and the [[Medieval Warm Period]] benefited agriculture until about 1315.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 2002AGUFMPP71C..09L | title=Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Periods in Eastern China as Read from the Speleothem Records | journal=AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts | year=2002 | authors=Li, H.; Ku, T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval period eventually saw the falling away of the invasions and incursions from outside the area that characterized the first millennium.  The [[Islamic conquests]] of the 6th and 7th century suddenly and permanently removed all of North Africa from the Western world, and over the rest of the period Islamic peoples gradually took over the [[Byzantine Empire]], until the end of the Middle Ages when Catholic Europe, having regained the Iberian peninsula in the southwest, was once again under Muslim threat from the southeast.

At the start of the medieval period most significant works of art were very rare and costly objects associated with secular elites, monasteries or major churches and, if religious, largely produced by monks.  By the end of the Middle Ages works of considerable artistic interest could be found in small villages and significant numbers of [[bourgeois]] homes in towns, and their production was in many places an important local industry, with artists from the [[clergy]] now the exception.  However the [[Rule of St Benedict]] permitted the sale of works of art by monasteries, and it is clear that throughout the period monks might produce art, including secular works, commercially for a lay market, and monasteries would equally hire lay specialists where necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), pp.&amp;nbsp;22–23, and Chapter III&lt;/ref&gt;

The impression may be left by the surviving works that almost all medieval art was religious.  This is far from the case; though the church became very wealthy over the Middle Ages and was prepared at times to spend lavishly on art, there was also much secular art of equivalent quality which has suffered from a far higher rate of wear and tear, loss and destruction.  The Middle Ages generally lacked the concept of preserving older works for their artistic merit, as opposed to their association with a saint or founder figure, and the following periods of the Renaissance and [[Baroque]] tended to disparage medieval art.  Most luxury illuminated manuscripts of the Early Middle Ages had lavish [[treasure binding]] book-covers in precious metal, ivory and jewels; the re-bound pages and ivory [[relief]]s for the covers have survived in far greater numbers than complete covers, which have mostly been stripped off for their valuable materials at some point.
[[File:Codex Aureus Sankt Emmeram.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Treasure binding|jewelled cover]] of the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]], c. 870, a Carolingian [[Gospel book]].]]

Most churches have been rebuilt, often several times, but medieval palaces and large houses have been lost at a far greater rate, which is also true of their fittings and decoration. In England, churches survive largely intact from every century since the 7th, and in considerable numbers for the later ones—the city of [[Norwich]] alone has 40 medieval churches—but of the dozens of royal palaces none survive from earlier than the 11th century, and only a handful of remnants from the rest of the period.&lt;ref&gt;The [[White Tower (Tower of London)]] was started in 1078, and some later royal apartments in the [[Tower of London]] survive, as do the hall and parts of [[Eltham Palace]], the most significant medieval remains from an unfortified royal palace. Royal apartments survive in some castles.&lt;/ref&gt;  The situation is similar in most of Europe, though the 14th century [[Palais des Papes]] in [[Avignon]] survives largely intact.  Many of the longest running scholarly disputes over the date and origin of individual works relate to secular pieces, because they are so much rarer - the Anglo-Saxon [[Fuller Brooch]] was refused by the [[British Museum]] as an implausible fake, and small free-standing secular bronze sculptures are so rare that the date, origin and even authenticity of both of the two best examples has been argued over for decades.&lt;ref&gt;the small Carolingian(?) ''Equestrian Statue of an Emperor'' in the [[Carnavalet Museum]] in Paris, Hinks, 125-7; and the 12th(?)-century bronze of a man wrestling with a lion, variously considered English, German or [[Sicily|Sicilian]] in origin, discussed by Henderson (1977), 135–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of valuable materials is a constant in medieval art; until the end of the period, far more was typically spent on buying them than on paying the artists, even if these were not monks performing their duties.  [[Gold]] was used for objects for churches and palaces, personal jewellery and the fittings of clothes, and—fixed to the back of glass [[tesserae]]—as a solid background for [[mosaic]]s, or applied as [[gold leaf]] to miniatures in manuscripts and panel paintings.  Many objects using precious metals were made in the knowledge that their bullion value might be realized at a future point—only near the end of the period could money be invested other than in [[real estate]], except at great risk or by committing [[usury]].
[[File:Wilton diptych.jpg|thumb|360px|The small private [[Wilton Diptych]] for [[Richard II of England]], c. 1400, with stamped gold backgrounds and much [[ultramarine]].]]

The even more expensive [[pigment]] [[ultramarine]], made from ground [[lapis lazuli]] obtainable only from [[Afghanistan]], was used lavishly in the Gothic period, more often for the traditional blue outer mantle of the [[Virgin Mary]] than for skies.  [[Ivory]], often painted, was an important material until the very end of the period, well illustrating the shift in luxury art to secular works; at the beginning of the period most uses were shifting from [[consular diptych]]s to religious objects such as book-covers, [[reliquaries]] and [[crozier]]s, but in the Gothic period secular mirror-cases, caskets and decorated combs become common among the well-off.  As thin ivory panels carved in [[relief]] could rarely be recycled for another work, the number of survivals is relatively high—the same is true of manuscript pages, although these were often re-cycled by scraping, whereupon they become [[palimpsest]]s.

Even these basic materials were costly: when the Anglo-Saxon [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey]] planned to create three copies of the bible in 692—of which one survives as the [[Codex Amiatinus]]—the first step necessary was to plan to breed the cattle to supply the 1,600 [[calf (animal)|calves]] to give the skin for the [[vellum]] required.&lt;ref&gt;Grocock, Chris has some calculations in [http://www.mayoalive.com/Mag1096/AbbyTalk.htm ''Mayo of the Saxons and Anglican Jarrow'', Evidence for a Monastic Economy], according to which sheep required only one third as much land per page as calves.  1,600 calves seems to be the standard estimate, see {{citation |last=John |first=Eric |title=Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England |year=1996 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |isbn=0-7190-5053-7 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7ju8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paper]] became available in the last centuries of the period, but was also extremely expensive by today's standards; [[woodcut]]s sold to ordinary pilgrims at shrines were often [[matchbook]] size or smaller.  Modern [[dendrochronology]] has revealed that most of the [[oak]] for panels used in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of the 15th century was felled in the [[Vistula]] basin in Poland, from where it was shipped down the river and across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea]]s to [[Flanders|Flemish]] ports, before being seasoned for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 29 – the following pages describe gold, pigments and other materials.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art in the Middle Ages is a broad subject and art historians traditionally divide it in several large-scale phases, styles or periods.  The period of the Middle Ages neither begins nor ends neatly at any particular date, nor at the same time in all regions, and the same is true for the major phases of art within the period.&lt;ref&gt;Dates are discussed in Calkins (1979), xix-xx, Kitzinger (1955), 1, Beckwith (1964), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The major phases are covered in the following sections.

==Early Christian and Late Antique art==
{{Main|Early Christian art}}
[[File:Arco di Costantino (Roma) - tondo lato settentrionale destro.jpg|thumb|[[Arch of Constantine]], Rome, completed 315: The lower long [[relief]], with squat figures of size varying with status, is of that date, while the [[roundels]] are taken from a monument of nearly 200 years earlier, which maintains a classical style.]]

Early Christian art, more generally described as [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] art, covers the period from about 200 (before which no distinct Christian art survives), until the onset of a fully [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]] in about 500.  There continue to be different views as to when the medieval period begins during this time, both in terms of general history and specifically art history, but it is most often placed late in the period.  In the course of the 4th century Christianity went from being a persecuted popular sect to the official religion of the Empire, adapting existing Roman styles and often [[iconography]], from both popular and Imperial art.  From the start of the period the main survivals of Christian art are the tomb-paintings in popular styles of the [[catacombs of Rome]], but by the end there were a number of lavish mosaics in churches built under Imperial patronage.

Over this period imperial Late [[Roman art]] went through a strikingly "baroque" phase, and then largely abandoned classical style and Greek realism in favour of a more mystical and hieratic style—a process that was well underway before Christianity became a major influence on imperial art.  Influences from Eastern parts of the Empire—[[Egypt]], [[Syria]] and beyond, and also a robust "Italic" vernacular tradition, contributed to this process. Figures are mostly seen frontally staring out at the viewer, where classical art tended to show a profile view - the change was eventually seen even on coins. The individuality of portraits, a great strength of Roman art, declines sharply, and the anatomy and drapery of figures is shown with much less realism. The models from which medieval Northern Europe in particular formed its idea of "Roman" style were nearly all portable Late Antique works, and the Late Antique carved [[sarcophagi]] found all over the former Roman Empire;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson (1977), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; the determination to find earlier "purer" classical models, was a key element in the art ''all'antica'' of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Hinks, chapters 1 &amp; 2, and Kitzinger, 1955, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Byzantine art==
{{Main|Byzantine art}}
[[File:Paris psaulter gr139 fol1v.jpg|thumb|left|[[King David]] plays the [[harp]] in the 10th century [[Paris Psalter]], a classicising work of the Macedonian period.]]

Byzantine art is the art of the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire formed after the division of the Roman Empire between Eastern and Western halves, and sometimes of parts of Italy under Byzantine rule.  It emerges from Late Antiquity in about 500 CE and soon formed a tradition distinct from that of Catholic Europe but with great influence over it.  In the early medieval period the best Byzantine art, often from the large Imperial workshops, represented an ideal of sophistication and technique which European patrons tried to emulate.  During the period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] in 730-843 the vast majority of [[icon]]s (sacred images usually painted on wood) were destroyed; so little remains that today any discovery sheds new understanding, and most remaining works are in Italy (Rome and [[Ravenna]] etc.), or Egypt at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]].

Byzantine art was extremely conservative, for religious and cultural reasons, but retained a continuous tradition of Greek realism, which contended with a strong anti-realist and hieratic impulse.   After the resumption of icon production in 843 until 1453 the Byzantine art tradition continued with relatively few changes, despite, or because of, the slow decline of the Empire.  There was a notable [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|revival of classical style]] in works of 10th century court art like the [[Paris Psalter]], and throughout the period manuscript illumination shows parallel styles, often used by the same artist, for iconic figures in framed miniatures and more informal small scenes or figures added unframed in the margins of the text in a much more realist style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitzinger|pp=57–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monumental sculpture]] with figures remained a taboo in Byzantine art; hardly any exceptions are known.  But small ivory reliefs, almost all in the iconic mode (the [[Harbaville Triptych]] is of similar date to the Paris Psalter, but very different in style), were a speciality, as was relief decoration on bowls and other metal objects.

The Byzantine Empire produced much of the finest art of the Middle Ages in terms of quality of material and workmanship, with court production centred on [[Constantinople]], although some art historians have questioned the assumption, still commonly made, that all work of the best quality with no indication as to origin was produced in the capital. Byzantine art's crowning achievement were the monumental [[fresco]]s and [[mosaic]]s inside domed churches, most of which have not survived due to natural disasters and the appropriation of churches to [[mosques]].
[[File:L'abbé Ména et le Christ 01.JPG|thumb|6th or 7th century [[Coptic art|Coptic]] [[Icon of Christ and Abbot Mena|icon of Jesus and an abbot]] shares in more homely form the anti-realist style of Byzantine iconic art.]]

Byzantine art exercised a continuous trickle of influence on Western European art, and the splendours of the Byzantine court and monasteries, even at the end of the Empire, provided a model for Western rulers and secular and clerical patrons.  For example, [[Byzantine silk]] textiles, often woven or embroidered with designs of both animal and human figures, the former often reflecting traditions originating much further east, were unexcelled in the Christian world until almost the end of the Empire.  These were produced, but probably not entirely so, in Imperial workshops in Constantinople, about whose operations we know next to nothing—similar workshops are often conjectured for other arts, with even less evidence.  Some other decorative arts were less developed; Byzantine [[ceramic art|ceramics]] rarely rise above the level of attractive [[folk art]], despite the [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek heritage]] and the impressive future in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period of [[İznik pottery|İznik wares]] and other types of pottery.

The [[Coptic art]] of Egypt took a different path; after the [[Coptic Church]] separated in the mid-5th century it was never again supported by the state, and native Egyptian influences dominated to produce a completely non-realist and somewhat naive style of large-eyed figures floating in blank space.  This was capable of great expressiveness, and took the "Eastern" component of Byzantine art to its logical conclusions.  Coptic decoration used intricate geometric designs, often anticipating Islamic art.  Because of the exceptionally good preservation of Egyptian burials, we know more about the textiles used by the less well-off in Egypt than anywhere else.  These were often elaborately decorated with figurative and patterned designs.  Other local traditions in [[Armenia]], [[Syria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and elsewhere showed generally less sophistication, but often more vigour than the art of [[Constantinople]], and sometimes, especially in [[architecture]], seem to have had influence even in Western Europe.  For example, figurative monumental sculpture on the outside of churches appears here some centuries before it is seen in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Atroshenko and Judith Collins cover the Eastern influences on Romanesque art in detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration Period through Christianization==
{{Main|Migration Period art}}
[[File:Sutton.Hoo.ShoulderClasp2.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|left|Shoulder-clasp from [[Sutton Hoo]], Anglo-Saxon, c. 620. Interlaced biting snakes and confronted [[boar]]s (end sections) are depicted entirely schematically.]]

Migration Period art describes the art of the "[[barbarian]]" Germanic and Eastern-European peoples who were on the move, and then settling within the former Roman Empire, during the [[Völkerwanderung|Migration Period]] from about 300-700; the blanket term covers a wide range of ethnic or regional styles including early [[Anglo-Saxon art]], [[Visigothic art]], [[Norse art]], and [[Merovingian art]], all of which made use of the [[animal style]] as well as geometric motifs derived from classical art.  By this period the animal style had reached a much more abstracted form than in earlier [[Scythian art]] or [[La Tène style]].  Most artworks were small and portable and those surviving are mostly jewellery and metalwork, with the art expressed in geometric or schematic designs, often beautifully conceived and made, with few human figures and no attempt at realism.  The early Anglo-Saxon [[grave good]]s from [[Sutton Hoo]] are among the best examples.

As the "barbarian" peoples were [[Christianization|Christianized]], these influences interacted with the post-classical Mediterranean Christian artistic tradition, and new forms like the [[illuminated manuscript]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henderson|1977|loc=ch. 2}}; {{Harvnb|Calkins|1979|loc=chs 8 &amp; 9}}; {{Harvnb|Wilson|1984|pp=16–27}} on early Anglo-Saxon art.&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed [[coin]]s, which attempted to emulate [[Roman provincial coins]] and [[Byzantine coinage|Byzantine]] types.  Early coinage like the [[sceat]] shows designers completely unused to depicting a head in profile grappling with the problem in a variety of different ways.

As for larger works, there are references to Anglo-Saxon wooden pagan statues, all now lost, and in Norse art the tradition of carved [[runestone]]s was maintained after their conversion to Christianity. The Celtic [[Picts]] of Scotland also [[Pictish stones|carved stones]] before and after conversion, and the distinctive Anglo-Saxon and Irish tradition of [[High cross|large outdoor carved crosses]] may reflect earlier pagan works.  [[Viking art]] from later centuries in [[Scandinavia]] and parts of the British Isles includes work from both pagan and Christian backgrounds, and was one of the last flowerings of this broad group of styles.

==Insular art==
{{Main|Insular art}}
[[File:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|[[Book of Lindisfarne]], [[Northumbria]], c. 715; decoration invades the text of the beginning of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]:"Liber generationis Jesu Christi filii David, filii Abraham".]]

Insular art refers to the distinct style found in Ireland and Britain from about the 7th century, to about the 10th century, lasting later in Ireland, and parts of Scotland.  The style saw a fusion between the traditions of [[Celtic art]], the Germanic [[Migration period art]] of the [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxons]] and the Christian forms of the book, [[high cross]]es and liturgical metalwork.

Extremely detailed geometric, [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]], and stylised animal decoration, with forms derived from secular metalwork like [[brooch]]es, spread boldly across manuscripts, usually [[gospel book]]s like the [[Book of Kells]], with whole [[carpet page]]s devoted to such designs, and the development of the large decorated and [[historiated initial]].  There were very few human figures—most often these were [[Evangelist portrait]]s—and these were crude, even when closely following Late Antique models.

The insular manuscript style was transmitted to the continent by the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]], and its anti-classical energy was extremely important in the formation of later medieval styles.  In most Late Antique manuscripts text and decoration were kept clearly apart, though some initials began to be enlarged and elaborated, but major insular manuscripts sometimes take a whole page for a single initial or the first few words (see illustration) at beginnings of gospels or other sections in a book.  Allowing decoration a "right to roam" was to be very influential on Romanesque and Gothic art in all media.

The buildings of the monasteries for which the insular gospel books were made were then small and could fairly be called primitive, especially in Ireland.  There increasingly were other decorations to churches, where possible in precious metals, and a handful of these survive, like the [[Ardagh Chalice]], together with a larger number of extremely ornate and finely made pieces of secular high-status jewellery, the [[Celtic brooch]]es probably worn mainly by men, of which the [[Tara Brooch]] is the most spectacular.

"Franco-Saxon" is a term for a school of late Carolingian illumination in north-eastern France that used insular-style decoration, including super-large initials, sometimes in combination with figurative images typical of contemporary French styles. The "most tenacious of all the Carolingian styles", it continued until as late as the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodwell|1993|pp=74(quote)–75}}, and see index.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The influence of Islamic art==

{{main|Islamic influences on Western art}}
[[Islamic art]] during the Middle Ages falls outside the scope of this article, but it was widely imported and admired by European elites, and its influence needs mention.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, 324; Mack, Chapter 1, and passim throughout; [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sumay/hd_sumay.htm The Art of the Umayyad Period in Spain (711–1031), Metropolitan Museum of Art timeline] Retrieved April 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic art covers a wide variety of media including calligraphy, illustrated manuscripts, textiles, ceramics, metalwork and glass, and refers to the art of Muslim countries in the Near East, Islamic Spain, and Northern Africa, though by no means always Muslim artists or craftsmen.  [[Islamic glass|Glass production]], for example, remained a [[Jewish]] speciality throughout the period, and Christian art, as in [[Coptic art|Coptic Egypt]] continued, especially during the earlier centuries, keeping some contacts with Europe.  There was an early formative stage from 600-900 and the development of regional styles from 900 onwards.  Early Islamic art used mosaic artists and sculptors trained in the Byzantine and Coptic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|pp=256–262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of wall-paintings, Islamic art used painted [[tile]]s, from as early as 862-3 (at the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque]] of [[Kairouan]] in modern [[Tunisia]]), which also spread to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[John Ruskin]], the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in [[Venice]] contains "three elements in exactly equal proportions — the Roman, the Lombard, and Arab. It is the central building of the world.&amp;nbsp;... the history of Gothic architecture is the history of the refinement and spiritualisation of Northern work under its influence".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'', [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/sov/1.html chapter 1, paras 25 and 29]; discussed pp.&amp;nbsp;49–56 here [https://books.google.com/books?id=QzI3Pf0TSn4C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=Ruskin+Orientalism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TF5qlcqm2M&amp;sig=PwSUx7Ghq5kozj-Y7AIWLOxPlk8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3AqjTfWYOpG4hAfP2tDWCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ruskin%20Orientalism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Islamic rulers controlled at various points parts of Southern Italy and most of modern Spain and Portugal, as well as the [[Balkans]], all of which retained large Christian populations. The Christian [[Crusade]]rs equally ruled Islamic populations. [[Crusader art]] is mainly a hybrid of Catholic and Byzantine styles, with little Islamic influence, but the [[Mozarabic art]] of Christians in [[Al Andaluz]] seems to show considerable influence from Islamic art, though the results are little like contemporary Islamic works. Islamic influence can also be traced in the mainstream of Western medieval art, for example in the Romanesque portal at [[Moissac]] in southern France, where it shows in both decorative elements, like the scalloped edges to the doorway, the circular decorations on the [[lintel]] above, and also in having ''Christ in Majesty'' surrounded by musicians, which was to become a common feature of Western heavenly scenes, and probably derives from images of Islamic kings on their [[Divan (furniture)|diwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|pp=206–209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calligraphy]], ornament and the [[decorative arts]] generally were more important than in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Dalu &amp; Michell, George, (eds); ''The Arts of Islam'', [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], 9, 1976, {{ISBN|0-7287-0081-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pre-Romanesque'' is a term for architecture and to some extent pictorial and portable art found initially in Southern Europe (Spain, Italy and Southern France) between the Late Antique period to the start of the Romanesque period in the 11th century.  Northern European art gradually forms part of the movement after [[Christianization]] as it assimilates post-classical styles.  The [[Carolingian art]] of the [[Frankish Empire]], especially modern France and Germany, from roughly 780-900 takes its name from [[Charlemagne]] and is an art of the court circle and a few monastic centres under Imperial patronage, that consciously sought to revive "Roman" styles and standards as befitted the new [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire of the West]].  Some centres of Carolingian production also pioneered expressive styles in works like the [[Utrecht Psalter]] and [[Ebbo Gospels]].  Christian [[monumental sculpture]] is recorded for the first time, and depiction of the human figure in narrative scenes became confident for the first time in Northern art.  [[Carolingian architecture]] produced larger buildings than had been seen since Roman times, and the [[westwork]] and other innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinks|1974|loc=Parts II &amp; III}}; {{Harvnb|Kitzinger|1955|loc=ch. 2}}; {{Harvnb|Calkins|1979|loc=chs 11 &amp; 12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of the dynasty there was a hiatus before a new dynasty brought a revival in Germany with [[Ottonian art]], again centred on the court and monasteries, with art that moved towards great expressiveness through simple forms that achieve monumentality even in small works like [[ivory]] [[relief]]s and [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|manuscript miniatures]], above all those of the [[Reichenau School]], such as the [[Pericopes of Henry II]] (1002–1012).  Later [[Anglo-Saxon art]] in England, from about 900, was expressive in a very different way, with agitated figures and even drapery perhaps best shown in the many pen drawings in manuscripts.  The [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic art]] of Christian Spain had strong Islamic influence, and a complete lack of interest in realism in its brilliantly coloured miniatures, where figures are presented as entirely flat patterns.  Both of these were to influence the formation in France of the Romanesque style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitzinger|1955|pp=75–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romanesque art==
{{Main|Romanesque art}}
[[File:Saint-Julien 03.jpg|thumb|[[Tympanum (architecture)|Tympanum]] at [[Saint-Julien-de-Jonzy]], mid-12th century. ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'' above, the ''[[Last Supper in Christian art|Last Supper]]'' below.]]

Romanesque art developed in the period between about 1000 to the rise of Gothic art in the 12th century, in conjunction with the rise of monasticism in Western Europe. The style developed initially in France, but spread to Christian Spain, England, Flanders, Germany, Italy, and elsewhere to become the first medieval style found all over Europe, though with regional differences.&lt;ref&gt;A complicated subject, covered in Dodwell (1993), 175, 223, 258 among many other passages.&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrival of the style coincided with a great increase in church-building, and in the size of [[cathedral]]s and larger churches; many of these were rebuilt in subsequent periods, but often reached roughly their present size in the Romanesque period.  [[Romanesque architecture]] is dominated by thick walls, massive structures conceived as a single organic form, with [[vault (architecture)|vault]]ed roofs and round-headed windows and arches.

Figurative sculpture, originally colourfully painted, plays an integral and important part in these buildings, in the [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of columns, as well as around impressive [[Portal (architecture)|portals]], usually centred on a [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] above the main doors, as at [[Vézelay Abbey]] and [[Autun Cathedral]].  Reliefs are much more common than free-standing statues in stone, but Romanesque relief became much higher, with some elements fully detached from the wall behind.  Large carvings also became important, especially painted wooden [[crucifix]]es like the [[Gero Cross]] from the very start of the period, and figures of the [[Virgin Mary]] like the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]].  Royalty and the higher clergy began to commission life-size effigies for [[tomb monument]]s.   Some churches had massive pairs of [[bronze]] doors decorated with narrative relief panels, like the [[Gniezno Doors]] or those at [[Hildesheim]], "the first decorated bronze doors cast in one piece in the West since Roman times", and arguably the finest before the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|pp=145–149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most churches were extensively frescoed; a typical scheme had ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'' at the east (altar) end, a ''[[Last Judgement]]'' at the west end over the doors, and scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' facing [[typology (theology)|typologically]] matching [[Old Testament]] scenes on the [[nave]] walls.  The "greatest surviving monument of Romanesque wall painting", much reduced from what was originally there, is in the [[Abbey Church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe]] near [[Poitiers]], where the rounded [[barrel vault]] of the [[nave]], the [[crypt]], [[portico]] and other areas retain most of their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henderson|1977|pp=190(quote)–195}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An equivalent cycle in [[Sant'Angelo in Formis]] at [[Capua]] in southern Italy by Italian painters trained by Greeks illustrates the continuing predominance of Byzantine style in much of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 167-169&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Moralia in Job MS dragonslayer.jpg|thumb|left|French [[historiated initial]] with men slaying a monster, from a theological manuscript.  1110–1115]]

Romanesque sculpture and painting is often extremely vigorous and expressive, and very inventive in terms of [[iconography]]—the subjects chosen and their treatment.  Though many features absorbed from classical art form part of the Romanesque style, Romanesque artists rarely intended to achieve any sort of classical effect, except perhaps in [[Mosan art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|pp=277 &amp; 284–288}}. {{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|p=149}}, says the bronze column at Hildesheim of c. 1020 "cannot be said to be Romanesque&amp;nbsp;... It stands apart as a curious Ottonian pastiche of a Roman monument&amp;nbsp;... never to be repeated"&lt;/ref&gt;  As art became seen by a wider section of the population, and because of challenges from new [[heresies]], art became more didactic, and the local church the "[[Poor Man's Bible]]".  At the same time grotesque beasts and monsters, and fights with or between them, were popular themes, to which religious meanings might be loosely attached, although this did not impress St [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who famously denounced such distractions in monasteries:&lt;blockquote&gt;But in the cloister, in the sight of the reading monks, what is the point of such ridiculous monstrosity, the strange kind of shapely shapelessness?  Why these unsightly monkeys, why these fierce lions, why the monstrous centaurs, why semi-humans, why spotted tigers, why fighting soldiers, why trumpeting huntsmen?&amp;nbsp;... In short there is such a variety and such a diversity of strange shapes everywhere that we may prefer to read the marbles rather than the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8csPCj2hPcC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Bernard+of+Clairvaux+decoration|title=Bernard's letter |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= 2006-01-01|accessdate=2011-06-11|isbn=978-1-888570-85-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  He might well have known the miniature at left, which was produced at [[Cîteaux Abbey]] before the young Bernard was transferred from there in 1115.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 212–214. The MS is the [[Dijon]] ''[[Moralia in Job]]'' of [[Gregory the Great]].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period [[typology (theology)|typology]] became the dominant approach in theological literature and art to interpreting the bible, with [[Old Testament]] incidents seen as pre-figurations of aspects of the life of Christ, and shown paired with their corresponding New Testament episode.  Often the iconography of the New Testament scene was based on traditions and models originating in Late Antiquity, but the iconography of the Old Testament episode had to be invented in this period, for lack of precedents.  New themes such as the [[Tree of Jesse]] were devised, and representations of [[God the Father]] became more acceptable.  The vast majority of surviving art is religious. [[Mosan art]] was an especially refined regional style, with much superb metalwork surviving, often combined with [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], and elements of classicism rare in Romanesque art, as in the [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège]], or the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]] at [[Cologne]], one of a number of surviving works by [[Nicholas of Verdun]], whose services were sought across north-western Europe.

[[Stained glass]] became a significant art-form in the period, though little Romanesque glass survives.  In illuminated manuscripts the bible became a new focus of intensive decoration, with the [[psalter]] also remaining important.  The strong emphasis on the suffering of Christ and other sacred figures entered Western art in this period, a feature that strongly distinguishes it from both Byzantine and classical art for the remainder of the Middle Ages and beyond.  The Gero Cross of 965-970, at the cusp of Ottonian and Romanesque art, has been called the first work to exhibit this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|p=271}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The end of the Romanesque period saw the start of the greatly increased emphasis on the [[Virgin Mary]] in theology, literature and so also art that was to reach its full extent in the Gothic period.

==Gothic art==
{{Main|Gothic art}}
[[File:Chartres cathedral 023 martyrs S TTaylor.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chartres cathedral]] c. 1220; the best High Gothic sculpture had largely rediscovered the art of naturalistic figure representation.]]
Gothic art is a variable term depending on the craft, place and time. The term originated with the [[Gothic architecture]] which developed in France from about 1137 with the rebuilding of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey Church of St Denis]].  As with Romanesque architecture, this included [[Gothic sculpture|sculpture]] as an integral part of the style, with even larger [[Portal (architecture)|portals]] and other figures on the [[facade]]s of churches the location of the most important sculpture, until the late period, when large carved [[altarpiece]]s and [[reredos]], usually in painted and gilded wood, became an important focus in many churches.  [[Gothic painting]] did not appear until around 1200 (this date has many qualifications), when it diverged from Romanesque style.  A [[Gothic sculpture|Gothic style in sculpture]] originates in France around 1144  and spread throughout Europe, becoming by the 13th century the international style, replacing Romanesque, though in sculpture and painting the transition was not as sharp as in architecture.

The majority of Romanesque cathedrals and large churches were replaced by Gothic buildings, at least in those places benefiting from the economic growth of the period—Romanesque architecture is now best seen in areas that were subsequently relatively depressed, like many  southern regions of France and Italy, or northern Spain.  The new architecture allowed for much larger windows, and stained glass of a quality never excelled is perhaps the type of art most associated in the popular mind with the Gothic, although churches with nearly all their original glass, like the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, are extremely rare anywhere, and unknown in Britain.

Most Gothic wall-paintings have also disappeared; these remained very common, though in parish churches often rather crudely executed.  Secular buildings also often had wall-paintings, although royalty preferred the much more expensive tapestries, which were carried along as they travelled between their many palaces and castles, or taken with them on military campaigns—the finest collection of late-medieval textile art comes from the Swiss booty at the [[Battle of Nancy]], when they defeated and killed [[Charles the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], and captured all his baggage train.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Historical Museum of Bern]] has many of the best pieces, and these and others were shown in an exhibition on Philip in Bern, Bruges and Vienna in 2008-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duccio maesta1021.jpg|thumb|The central panel of [[Duccio]]'s huge [[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà]] [[altarpiece]] for [[Siena Cathedral]].]]
As mentioned in the previous section, the Gothic period coincided with a greatly increased emphasis on the Virgin Mary, and it was in this period that the [[Virgin and Child]] became such a hallmark of Catholic art.  Saints were also portrayed far more often, and many of the range of [[Saint symbolism|attributes]] developed to identify them visually for a still largely illiterate public first appeared.

During this period [[panel painting]] for altarpieces, often [[polyptych]]es and smaller works became newly important.  Previously [[icon]]s on panels had been much more common in Byzantine art than in the West, although many now lost panel paintings made in the West are documented from much earlier periods, and initially Western painters on panel were very largely under the sway of Byzantine models, especially in Italy, from where most early Western panel paintings come.  The process of establishing a distinct Western style was begun by [[Cimabue]] and [[Duccio]], and completed by [[Giotto]], who is traditionally regarded as the starting point for the development of Renaissance painting.  Most panel painting remained more conservative than miniature painting however, partly because it was seen by a wide public.
[[File:Reconstruction of the temple of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Reconstruction of the temple of Jerusalem'', Burgundian miniature, c. 1460.]]

[[International Gothic]] describes courtly Gothic art from about 1360 to 1430, after which Gothic art begins to merge into the [[Renaissance art]] that had begun to form itself in Italy during the [[Trecento]], with a return to classical principles of composition and realism, with the sculptor [[Nicola Pisano]] and the painter [[Giotto]] as especially formative figures.  The [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] is one of the best known works of International Gothic.  The transition to the Renaissance occurred at different times in different places - [[Early Netherlandish painting]] is poised between the two, as is the Italian painter [[Pisanello]]. Outside Italy Renaissance styles appeared in some works in courts and some wealthy cities while other works, and all work beyond these centres of innovation, continued late Gothic styles for a period of some decades.  The [[Protestant Reformation]] often provided an end point for the Gothic tradition in areas that went Protestant, as it was associated with Catholicism.

The invention of a comprehensive mathematically based system of [[linear perspective]] is a defining achievement of the early-15th-century [[Italian Renaissance]] in [[Florence]], but Gothic painting had already made great progress in the naturalistic depiction of distance and volume, though it did not usually regard them as essential features of a work if other aims conflicted with them, and late Gothic sculpture was increasingly naturalistic. In the mid-15th century Burgundian miniature (right) the artist seems keen to show his skill at representing buildings and blocks of stone obliquely, and managing scenes at different distances.  But his general attempt to reduce the size of more distant elements is unsystematic. Sections of the composition are at a similar scale, with relative distance shown by overlapping, [[foreshortening]], and further objects being higher than nearer ones, though the workmen at left do show finer adjustment of size. But this is abandoned on the right where the most important figure is much larger than the mason.
[[File:Totentanz blockbook q.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Death comes for the Cardinal'', from a printed [[blockbook]] with hand colour, c. 1455–58, an early example of the [[Dance of Death]].]]

The end of the period includes new media such as [[old master print|prints]]; along with small panel paintings these were frequently used for the emotive [[andachtsbilder]] ("devotional images") influenced by new religious trends of the period.  These were images of moments detached from the narrative of the [[Passion of Christ]] designed for meditation on his sufferings, or those of the Virgin: the [[Man of Sorrows]], [[Pietà]], [[Veil of Veronica]] or [[Arma Christi]]. The trauma of the [[Black Death]] in the mid-14th century was at least partly responsible for the popularity of themes such as the ''[[Dance of Death]]'' and ''[[Memento mori]]''.  In the cheap [[blockbook]]s with text (often in the [[vernacular]]) and images cut in a single [[woodcut]], works such as that illustrated (left), the ''[[Ars Moriendi]]'' (''Art of Dying'') and typological verse summaries of the bible like the ''[[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]'' (''Mirror of Human Salvation'') were the most popular.

[[Renaissance Humanism]] and the rise of a wealthy urban middle class, led by merchants, began to transform the old social context of art, with the revival of realistic portraiture and the appearance of printmaking and the [[self-portrait]], together with the decline of forms like stained glass and the illuminated manuscript.  [[Donor portrait]]s, in the Early Medieval period largely the preserve of popes, kings and abbots, now showed businessmen and their families, and churches were becoming crowded with the [[tomb monument]]s of the well-off.

The typical exuberantly decorated margins descend from [[insular art]], and are unlike anything in the Byzantine tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Plummer|1964|loc=plates 1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[book of hours]], a type of manuscript normally owned by laymen, or even more often, laywomen, became the type of manuscript most often heavily illustrated from the 14th century onwards, and also by this period, the lead in producing miniatures had passed to lay artists, also very often women.  In the most important centres of illumination, Paris and in the 15th century the cities of [[Flanders]], there were large workshops, exporting to other parts of Europe.  Other forms of art, such as small ivory reliefs, stained glass, tapestries and [[Nottingham alabaster]]s (cheap carved panels for altarpieces) were produced in similar conditions, and artists and craftsmen in cities were usually covered by the [[guild]] system—the [[goldsmith]]'s guild was typically among the richest in a city, and painters were members of a special [[Guild of St Luke]] in many places.

Secular works, often using subjects concerned with [[courtly love]] or [[chivalry|knightly heroism]], were produced as illuminated manuscripts, carved ivory mirror-cases, tapestries and elaborate gold table centrepieces like [[Nef (metalwork)|nefs]].  It begins to be possible to distinguish much greater numbers of individual artists, some of whom had international reputations.  Art collectors begin to appear, of manuscripts among the great nobles, like [[John, Duke of Berry]] (1340–1416) and of prints and other works among those with moderate wealth.  In the wealthier areas tiny cheap religious [[woodcut]]s brought art in an approximation of the latest style even into the homes of peasants by the late 15th century.

==Subsequent reputation==

Medieval art had little sense of its own art history, and this disinterest was continued in later periods.  The Renaissance generally dismissed it as a "barbarous" product of the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]", and the [[Gothic architecture#The term "Gothic"|term "Gothic"]] was invented as a deliberately pejorative one, first used by the painter [[Raphael]] in a letter of 1519 to characterise all that had come between the demise of Classical art and its supposed 'rebirth' in the [[Renaissance]]. The term was subsequently adopted and popularised in the mid 16th century by the Florentine artist and historian, [[Giorgio Vasari]], who used it to denigrate northern European architecture generally. Illuminated manuscripts continued to be collected by [[antiquarian]]s, or sit unregarded in monastic or royal libraries, but paintings were mostly of interest if they had historical associations with royalty or others.  The long period of mistreatment of the [[Westminster Retable]] by [[Westminster Abbey]] is an example; until the 19th century it was only regarded as a useful piece of timber.  But their large portrait of [[Richard II of England]] was well looked after, like another portrait of Richard, the [[Wilton Diptych]] (illustrated above).  As in the Middle Ages themselves, other objects have often survived mainly because they were considered to be [[relic]]s.

There was no equivalent for pictorial art of the "[[Gothic survival]]" found in architecture, once the style had finally died off in Germany, England and [[Scandinavia]], and the [[Gothic Revival]] long focused on [[Gothic Architecture]] rather than art.  The understanding of the succession of styles was still very weak, as suggested by the title of [[Thomas Rickman]]'s pioneering book on English architecture: ''An Attempt to discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation'' (1817).  This began to change with a vengeance by the mid-19th century, as appreciation of medieval sculpture and its painting, known as Italian or Flemish "Primitives", became fashionable under the influence of writers including [[John Ruskin]], [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], and [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]], as well as the romantic [[medievalism]] of literary works like Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' (1819) and [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1831).  Early collectors of the "Primitives", then still relatively cheap, included [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]].

Among artists the German [[Nazarene movement]] from 1809 and English [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] from 1848 both rejected the values of at least the later Renaissance, but in practice, and despite sometimes depicting medieval scenes, their work draws its influences mostly from the [[Early Renaissance]] rather than the Gothic or earlier periods - the early graphic work of [[John Millais]] being something of an exception.&lt;ref&gt;In works like [http://www.preraphaelites.org/the-collection/1906P646/the-death-of-romeo-and-juliet-compositional-study/ this], stylistically very different from the finished painting.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Morris]], also a discriminating collector of medieval art, absorbed medieval style more thoroughly into his work, as did [[William Burges]].[[File:Meister von Castelseprio 001.jpg|thumb|left|''Joseph's Dream'' from the Byzantinesque [[fresco]]s at [[Castelseprio]], the subject of much controversy since their discovery in 1944, and now generally dated to the 10th century.]]By the later 19th century many book-illustrators and producers of decorative art of various kinds had learned to use medieval styles successfully from the new museums like the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] set up for this purpose.  At the same time the new academic field of [[art history]], dominated by Germany and France, concentrated heavily on medieval art and was soon very productive in cataloguing and dating the surviving works, and analysing the development of medieval styles and iconography; though the Late Antique and pre-Carolingian period remained a less explored "no-man's land" until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitzinger|1955|pp=1(quote)–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franz Theodor Kugler]] was the first to name and describe Carolingian art in 1837; like many art historians of the period he sought to find and promote the national spirit of his own nation in art history, a search begun by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] in the 18th century.  Kugler's pupil, the great Swiss art historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]], though he could not be called a specialist in medieval art, was an important figure in developing the understanding of it.  Medieval art was now heavily collected, both by museums and private collectors like [[George Salting]], the [[Rothschild family]] and [[John Pierpont Morgan]].

After the decline of the [[Gothic Revival]], and the [[Celtic Revival]] use of Insular styles, the anti-realist and expressive elements of medieval art have still proved an inspiration for many modern artists.

German-speaking art historians continued to dominate medieval art history, despite figures like [[Émile Mâle]] (1862–1954) and [[Henri Focillon]] (1881–1943), until the Nazi period, when a large number of important figures emigrated, mostly to Britain or America, where the academic study of art history was still developing.  These included the elderly [[Adolph Goldschmidt]] and younger figures including [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], [[Ernst Kitzinger]], [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Kurt Weitzmann]], [[Richard Krautheimer]] and many others.  [[Meyer Schapiro]] had immigrated as a child in 1907.

== Prejudice ==
During the Middle Ages some Christian art was used as a way to express prejudices and commonly held negative views that were held against other religions and groups of people.

=== Jewish portrayals in medieval Christian art ===

In Medieval Europe between the 5th and 15th century many Christians viewed Jews as enemies and outsiders due to a variety of factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jewm/hd_jewm.htm|title=Jews and the Arts in Medieval Europe|last=Holcomb|first=Barbara Drake|last2=Holcomb|first2=Melanie|date=June 2008|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also tended to hate them for being both culturally and religiously different as well as because of religious teachings that held negative views of Jewish people such as portrayals of the Antichrist as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdtSQ9v9T3IC&amp;pg=PA383&amp;lpg=PA383&amp;dq=Lipton+%22jewish+hat%22+enemies+of+Christ&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EqtM2kWlYN&amp;sig=2O0Qt5N7Wf9Ka_216Mh4F93xodc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-hpal5t_XAhVGqlQKHYCABtMQ6AEIQjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lipton%20%22jewish%20hat%22%20enemies%20of%20Christ&amp;f=false|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Monsters and the Monstrous|last=Mittman|first=Asa Simon|last2=Dendle|first2=Peter J.|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=|isbn=9781472418012|location=|pages=383|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Jewish people's economic position as moneylenders, coupled with royal protections that were given to them,{{Example needed|date=June 2018}} created a strained relationship between Jews and Christians. This strain manifested itself in several ways, one of which was through the creation of [[Medieval antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[Anti-Judaism in early Christianity|anti-Judaism]] art and propaganda that served the purpose of discrediting both Jews and their religious beliefs as well as spreading these beliefs even further into society.  Late medieval images of [[Ecclesia and Synagoga]] represented the Christian doctrine of [[Supersessionism|supercessionism]], whereby the Christian [[New Covenant]] had replaced the Jewish [[Mosaic covenant]]&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Christine, "The Jewish Mother-in-law; Synagoga and the ''Man of Law's Tale''", pp. 8-11, in Delany, Sheila (ed), ''Chaucer and the Jews : Sources, Contexts, Meanings'', 2002, Routledge, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T6YMJAuDAdEC&amp;pg=PA8 google books], {{ISBN|0-415-93882-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-93882-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sara Lipton has argued that some portrayals, such as depictions of Jewish blindness in the presence of Jesus, were meant to serve as a form of self-reflection rather than be explicitly anti-Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9f6gBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq|title=Dark Mirror: The Medieval Origins of Anti-Jewish Iconography|last=Lipton|first=Sara|date=2014-11-04|publisher=Macmillan|year=|isbn=9780805079104|location=|pages=5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2013 book ''Saracens, Demons, and Jews'', Debra Higgs Strickland argues that negative portrayals of Jews in medieval art can be divided into three categories: art that focused on physical descriptions, art that featured signs of damnation, and images that depicted Jews as monsters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Physical depictions of Jewish people in medieval Christian art were often men with pointed [[Jewish hat]]s and long beards, which was done as a derogatory symbol and to separate Jews from Christians in a clear manner. This portrayal would grow more virulent over time, however Jewish women lacked similar distinctive physical descriptions in high medieval Christian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lipton|first=Sara|date=2008|title=Where Are the Gothic Jewish Women?

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By separating the image into components with different compressibility characteristics, the most efficient and accurate compression algorithm for each component can be applied.

MRC-compressed images are typically packaged into a hybrid file format such as [[PDF]]. This allows for multiple images, and the instructions to properly render and reassemble them, to be stored within a single file.

[[File:Château de Versailles, salon des nobles, Pygmalion priant Vénus d'animer sa statue, Jean-Baptiste Regnault.jpg|thumb|''[[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]], 1786, [[Musée national du château et des Trianons]]]]

'''Object sexuality''' or '''objectophilia''' is a form of [[sexuality]] focused on particular inanimate objects. Individuals with this preference may have strong feelings of attraction, love, and commitment to certain items or structures of their fixation.  For some, sexual or even close emotional relationships with humans are incomprehensible. Some object-sexual individuals also often believe in [[animism]], and sense reciprocation based on the belief that objects have souls, intelligence, and feelings, and are able to communicate.

== Research ==
In 2009 Amy Marsh, a clinical sexologist, surveyed the twenty-one English-speaking members of [[Erika Eiffel]]'s 40-strong OS Internationale about their experiences.&lt;ref name=ehjs&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ejhs.org/volume13/ObjSexuals.htm|title=Love Among the Objectum Sexuals|journal=Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality |volume=13|date=2010-03-01|first=Amy|last=Marsh}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half reported [[autism spectrum]] disorders: six had been diagnosed, four were affected but not diagnosed, and three of the remaining nine reported having "some traits."&lt;ref&gt;''N.B.'' There are only 20 responses, though the author claims 21 respondents.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marsh, "The emotions and experiences reported by OS people correspond to general definitions of sexual orientation," such as that in an [[American Psychological Association|APA]] article "on sexual orientation and homosexuality ... [which] refers to sexual orientation as involving 'feelings and self concept.'"

== OS awareness and advocacy==
In 2009, [[Erika Eiffel]] appeared on ''[[Good Morning America]]''&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; and the ''[[Tyra Banks Show]]''{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} with Amy Marsh to discuss her marriage to the [[Eiffel Tower]] and how her object love helped her become a world champion archer. Marsh shared the results of her survey and her belief that OS could be a genuine sexual orientation, and reasoned that if childhood trauma were a factor, that there would be more OS individuals. Eiffel, who  had adopted her [[surname]] after a 2007 "marriage" to the Eiffel Tower,&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|first1=Kate|last1=Snow|first2=Janann|last2=Brady|date=2009-04-08|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=7283494&amp;page=1|title=Woman Proves Love for Eiffel Tower With Commitment Ceremony}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded '''OS Internationale''', an educational website and international online community for those identifying or researching the condition to love objects.

Amanda Liberty told the [[Daily Mail]] in March 2012 that the [[Statue of Liberty]] "is my long-distance lover and I am blown away by how stunning she is. Other people might be shocked to think I can have romantic feelings for an object, but I am not the same as them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2110198/Im-head-heels-love-Statue-Liberty-Shop-assistant-got-new-flame.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=David | last=Baker | title='I'm head over heels in love with the Statue of Liberty': Shop assistant has got a new flame! | date=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later Reighner Deleighnie declared her love for a short marble statue of [[Adonis]] that she'd named "Hans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2119164/Carer-40-spends-day-400-Adonis-moulding-dubbed-Hans.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=I'm in love with a three-foot statue of Adonis: Carer, 40, spends every day with £400 moulding of the Greek god of desire she has dubbed 'Hans' | date=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==
Marsh sees OS-like behavior in classic literature.&lt;ref name=ehjs/&gt; In Victor Hugo’s ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'',

{{quote|[Quasimodo] loved [the bells], caressed them, talked to them, understood them. From the carillon in the steeple of the transept to the great bell over the doorway, they all shared his love.

Claude Frollo had made him the bell ringer of Notre-Dame, and to give the great bell in marriage to Quasimodo was to give Juliet to Romeo.}}

{{Paleontology}}
'''Paleotempestology''' is the study of past [[tropical cyclone]] activity by means of geological proxies as well as historical documentary records. The term was coined by [[Kerry Emanuel]].

==Methods==

===Sedimentary proxy records===
Examples of proxies include [[overwash]] deposits preserved in the [[sediment]]s of coastal lakes and [[marsh]]es, [[Micropaleontology|microfossil]]s such as [[foraminifera]], [[pollen]], [[diatom]]s, [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[phytolith]]s contained in coastal sediments, wave-generated or flood-generated sedimentary structures or deposits (called [[tempestite]]s) in marine or [[lagoon]]al sediments, storm wave deposited [[coral]] shingle, shell, sand and shell and pure sand shore parallel ridges.

The method of using overwash deposits preserved in coastal lake and marsh sediments is adopted from earlier studies of paleotsunami deposits. Both [[storm]]s and [[tsunami]]s leave very similar if not identical sedimentary deposits in coastal lakes and marshes and differentiating between the two in a sedimentary record can be difficult. The first studies to examine prehistoric records of tropical cyclones occurred in Australia and the South Pacific during the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Baines1976"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; These studies examined multiple shore parallel ridges of coral shingle or sand and marine shells. As many as 50 ridges can be deposited at a site with each representing a past severe [[tropical cyclone]] over the previous 6,000 years. Tsunamis are not known to deposit multiple sedimentary ridges and therefore these features can be more easily attributed to a past storm at any given site.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Markers in coral===
Rocks contain certain [[isotope]]s of [[chemical element|element]]s, known as natural tracers, which describe the conditions under which they formed.  By studying the [[calcium carbonate]] in coral rock, past sea surface temperature and hurricane information can be revealed.  Heavier [[oxygen]] isotopes ([[Oxygen-18|&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]]) decrease in relation to lighter oxygen isotopes ([[Oxygen-16|&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O]]) in coral during periods of very heavy [[rain]]fall.&lt;ref&gt;Nobu Shimizu.

===Speleothems and tree rings===
Isotope studies in [[speleothem]]s and tree rings ([[dendrochronology]]) offers a means by which higher resolution records of long-term tropical cyclone histories can be attained.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Dana L. |year=2006 |title=Tree-ring isotope records of tropical cyclone activity |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |volume=103 |issue=39 |pages=14294&amp;ndash;14297 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0606549103 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=16984996 |pmc=1570183 |bibcode = 2006PNAS..10314294M |display-authors=etal}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the isotope records, the sedimentary records are too coarse in their resolution to register quasi-cyclic activity at decadal to centennial scales. These higher resolution records therefore offer a means for possibly differentiating between the natural variability of tropical cyclone behaviour and the effects of anthropogenically induced global [[climate change]].  Recent studies with [[stalagmite]]s in [[Belize]] shows that events can be determined on a week-by-week basis.&lt;ref name="Frappier2007"&gt;

===Historical records===
[[File:StateLibQld 1 186783 Royal Charter (ship).jpg|thumb|300px|right|&lt;center&gt;The ''[[Royal Charter (ship)|Royal Charter]]'' which sank in a storm off [[Anglesey]] in 1859.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Before the invention of the [[telegraphy|telegraph]] in the early to mid-19th century, news was as fast as the fastest horse or stagecoach or ship.  Normally, there was no advance warning of a tropical cyclone impact.  However, the situation changed in the 19th century as seafaring people and land-based researchers, such as Father Viñes in [[Cuba]], came up with systematic methods of reading the sky's appearance or the sea state, which could foretell a tropical cyclone's approach up to a couple days in advance.

One of the best documented storms is the [[Royal Charter Storm]] of 1859 which caused over 800 deaths in the UK alone. It led directly to the formation of the [[Meteorological Office]] under [[Robert Fitzroy]]. However, wind speed could not be measured accurately at the time, methods only becoming available after the [[Tay Bridge disaster]] of 1879.
One of the better sources for storms in and around [[Great Britain|Britain]] is the [[shipwreck]] statistics compiled annually by the [[Board of Trade]], but which have yet to be analysed in detail.

Michael Chenoweth used 18th century journals to reconstruct the climate of [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name="Chenoweth2003"&gt;
{{Cite book |title=The 18th century climate of Jamaica derived from the journals of [[Thomas Thistlewood]], 1750-1786 |last=Chenoweth |first=Michael |year=2003 |series=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society |volume=93 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-87169-932-X |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Dmitry Divine, he also created a 318-year (1690–2007) record of tropical cyclones in the [[Lesser Antilles]], using newspaper accounts, ships' [[logbook]]s, meteorological journals, and other document sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chenoweth |first=Michael |last2=Divine |first2=Dmitry |year=2008 |title=A document-based 318-year record of tropical cyclones in the Lesser Antilles, 1690–2007 |journal=Geochem.

In [[China]], the abundance of historical documentary records in the form of ''Fang Zhi'' (semiofficial local [[gazette]]s) offers an extraordinary opportunity for providing a high-resolution historical dataset for the frequency of [[Pacific typhoon|typhoon]] strikes.&lt;ref name="Liu2001"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Kam-biu Liu |author2=Caiming Shen |author3=Kin-sheun Louie |year=2001 |title=A 1,000-Year History of Typhoon Landfalls in Guangdong, Southern China, Reconstructed from Chinese Historical Documentary Records |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=453&amp;ndash;464 |doi=10.1111/0004-5608.00253 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3187">In [[oceanography]], '''phytodetritus''' is the organic particulate matter resulting from [[phytoplankton]] and other organic material in surface waters falling to the seabed. This process takes place almost continuously as a "[[marine snow]]" of descending particles, falling at the rate of about {{convert|100|to|150|m|0|abbr=on}} per day.&lt;ref name=Gooday/&gt; Under certain conditions, phytoplankton may aggregate and fall rapidly through the [[water column]] to arrive little changed on the seabed. These fluxes sometimes occur seasonally or periodically, are sometimes associated with [[algal bloom]]s and may constitute the greater part of descending organic matter. If the amount is greater than the [[benthos|benthic]] [[detritivore]]s can process, the phytodetritus forms a fluffy layer on the surface of the sediment. It accumulates in many shallow and deep water locations throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oceanography and Marine Biology, An Annual Review, Volume 40 |last=Gibson |first=R.

Phytodetritus varies in colour and appearance and may be greenish, brown or grey, flocculent or gelatinous.

[[File:Earth-crust-cutaway-english.svg|thumb|The layers of the [[Earth]], a differentiated planetary body]]
In [[planetary science]], '''planetary differentiation''' is the process of separating out different constituents of a planetary body as a consequence of their physical or chemical behavior, where the body develops into compositionally distinct layers; the [[density|denser]] materials of a [[planet]] sink to the center, while less dense materials rise to the surface, generally in a [[magma ocean]]. Such a process tends to create a [[Planetary core|core]] and [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. Sometimes a chemically distinct [[Crust (geology)|crust]] forms on top of the mantle. The process of planetary differentiation has occurred on planets, [[dwarf planet]]s, the asteroid [[4 Vesta]], and [[natural satellite]]s (such as the [[Moon]]). 

==Heating==
When the [[Sun]] ignited in the [[solar nebula]], [[hydrogen]], [[helium]] and other volatile materials were evaporated in the region around it. The [[solar wind]] and [[radiation pressure]] forced these low-density materials away from the Sun. Rocks, and the elements comprising them, were stripped of their early atmospheres,{{Citation needed|reason=it is not clear whether bodies with atmospheres precede the 'ignition' of the Sun or not|date=July 2012}} but themselves remained, to accumulate into [[protoplanet]]s.

Protoplanets had higher concentrations of [[radioactive]] elements early in their history, the quantity of which has reduced over time due to [[radioactive decay]]. Heating due to radioactivity, impacts, and gravitational pressure melted parts of protoplanets as they grew toward being [[planet]]s. In melted zones, it was possible for denser materials to sink towards the center, while lighter materials rose to the surface. The compositions of some [[meteorite]]s ([[achondrite]]s) show that differentiation also took place in some [[asteroid]]s (e.g. [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]), that are parental bodies for meteoroids. The short-lived radioactive isotope [[aluminium-26|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]] was probably the main source of heat.&lt;ref&gt;de Pater, I., and Lissauer, J.J. 2001. Planetary Sciences, Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prialnik D., Merk R., 2008. Growth and evolution of small porous icy bodies with an adaptive-grid thermal evolution code. I. Application to Kuiper Belt objects and Enceladus. Icarus 197: 211–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

When protoplanets [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accrete]] more material, the energy of impact causes local heating. In addition to this temporary heating, the gravitational force in a sufficiently large body creates pressures and temperatures which are sufficient to melt some of the materials. This allows [[chemical reaction]]s and [[density]] differences to mix and separate materials,{{Citation needed|reason=The mechanism is still unclear, specify|date=July 2012}} and soft materials to spread out over the surface.

On [[Earth]], a large piece of molten [[iron]] is sufficiently denser than [[continental crust]] material to force its way down through the crust to the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} In the outer Solar System a similar process may take place but with lighter materials: they may{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} be [[hydrocarbons]] such as [[methane]], [[water]] as liquid or ice, or frozen [[carbon dioxide]].

==Chemical differentiation==
Although bulk materials differentiate outward or inward according to their density, the elements that are chemically bound in them [[fractionation|fractionate]] according to their chemical affinities, "carried along" by more abundant materials with which they are associated. For instance, although the rare element [[uranium]] is very dense as a pure element, it is chemically more compatible as a trace element in the Earth's light, [[silicate]]-rich crust{{Citation needed|reason=how so|date=July 2012}} than in the dense metallic core.

==Physical differentiation==

===Gravitational separation===
High-[[density]] materials tend to sink through lighter materials. This tendency is affected by the relative structural strengths, but such strength is reduced at temperatures where both materials are plastic or molten. [[Iron]], the most common element that is likely to form a very dense molten metal phase, tends to congregate towards planetary interiors. With it, many [[Siderophile element|siderophile]] elements (i.e. materials that readily [[metal alloy|alloy]] with iron) also travel downward. However, not all heavy elements make this transition as some [[chalcophile|chalcophilic]] heavy elements bind into low-density silicate and oxide compounds, which differentiate in the opposite direction.

The main compositionally differentiated zones in the solid Earth are the very dense iron-rich metallic [[Planetary core|core]], the less dense [[talc|magnesium-silicate]]-rich [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and the relatively thin, light [[Crust (geology)|crust]] composed mainly of silicates of [[aluminium]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]] and [[potassium]]. Even lighter still are the watery liquid [[hydrosphere]] and the gaseous, nitrogen-rich [[atmosphere]].

Lighter materials tend to rise through material with a higher density. They may take on dome-shaped forms called [[diapir]]s when doing so. On Earth, [[salt dome]]s are [[salt]] diapirs in the crust which rise through surrounding rock. Diapirs of molten low-density silicate rocks such as [[granite]] are abundant in the Earth's upper crust. The hydrated, low-density [[serpentinite]] formed by alteration of [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] material at [[subduction zone]]s can also rise to the surface as diapirs. Other materials do likewise: a low-temperature, near-surface example is provided by [[mud volcano]]s.

===Moon's KREEP===
On the Moon, a distinctive [[basalt]]ic material has been found that is high in "incompatible elements" such as [[potassium]], [[rare earth element]]s, and [[phosphorus]] and is often referred to by the abbreviation [[KREEP]]. It is also high in [[uranium]] and [[thorium]]. These elements are excluded{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} from the major minerals of the lunar crust which crystallized out from its primeval [[Lunar magma ocean|magma ocean]], and the KREEP basalt may have been trapped as a chemical differentiate between the crust and the mantle, with occasional eruptions to the surface.

===Fractional melting and crystallization===
[[Magma]] in the Earth is produced by [[partial melting]] of a source rock, ultimately in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. The melt extracts a large portion of the "incompatible elements" from its source that are not stable in the major minerals. When magma rises above a certain depth the dissolved minerals start to crystallize at particular pressures and temperatures. The resulting solids remove various elements from the melt, and melt is thus depleted of those elements. Study of trace elements in [[igneous rock]]s thus gives us information about what source melted by how much to produce a magma, and which minerals have been lost from the melt.

===Thermal diffusion===
When material is unevenly heated, lighter material migrates toward hotter zones and heavier material migrates towards colder areas, which is known as [[thermophoresis]], thermomigration, or the [[Thermophoresis|Soret effect]]. This process can affect differentiation in [[magma chamber]]s.

===Differentiation through collision===
[[Earth]]'s [[Moon]] probably formed out of material splashed into orbit by the impact of a large body into the early Earth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Differentiation on Earth had probably already separated many lighter materials toward the surface, so that the impact removed a disproportionate amount of silicate material from Earth, and left the majority of the dense metal behind. The Moon's density is substantially less than that of Earth, due to its lack of a large iron core.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Density differences on Earth==
On [[Earth]], physical and chemical differentiation processes led to a crustal density of approximately 2700&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; compared to the 3400&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; density of the compositionally different mantle just below, and the average density of the planet as a whole is 5515&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

A '''programmable load''' is a type of test equipment or instrument which emulates DC or AC resistance loads normally required to perform functional tests of [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[power supply|power supplies]] or [[solar cells]]. By virtue of being programmable, tests like [[load regulation]], [[Battery (electricity)#Battery capacity and discharging|battery discharge]] curve measurement and [[Transient (oscillation)|transient tests]] can be fully automated and load changes for these tests can be made without introducing switching transient that might change the measurement or operation of the power source under test.

== Implementation ==
In a sense, a fully programmable load is simply a programmable power supply that applies a voltage and sinks current (absorbing power) or sources current (transferring power). This is necessary to simulate real loads where there are moments when current and voltage have polarity which makes the load appear to act as a ''source'' of power; for example, circuits with capacitive or inductive elements when an AC or varying DC is applied; see [[power factor]]. By being able to change the current direction, the programmable load schematically will still "look like" a programmable resistor while still being a programmable ([[Thévenin's theorem|Thévenin]]) voltage source.

However, most commercially available "electronic DC loads" or "programmable DC loads" on the market cannot source power, since by being DC loads, by strict definition, they do not need to. (They are not power supplies), being only able to absorb power (sinking current from a positive voltage, or sourcing to a negative voltage). These most commonly use one transistor/FET, or an array of parallel connected transistors/FETs for more current handling, to act as a variable resistor. Internal circuitry in the equipment monitors the actual current through the transistor/FET, compares it to a user-programmed desired current, and through an error amplifier changes the drive voltage to the transistor/FET to dynamically change its resistance. This 'negative feedback' results in the actual current always matching the programmed desired current, regardless of other changes in the supplied voltage or other variables. Of course, if the power source is not able to supply the desired amount of current, the DC load equipment cannot furnish the difference; it can restrict current to a level, but it cannot boost current to a higher level. Most commercial DC loads are equipped with microprocessor front end circuits that allow the user to not only program a desired current through the load ('constant current' or CC), but the user can alternatively program the load to have a constant resistance (CR) or constant power dissipation (CP).

Advanced DC Programmable loads offer additional test capabilities with internal controls that can detect oscillations within a fraction of a second and immediately stabilize the load profile. By eliminating the effects of oscillation and current spikes a programmable load can protect against damage to your mission critical electronics.

Electronic load testing systems for defense, aerospace, commercial electronics and utilities industries, as well as for mega data center performance often require special modes of operation such as constant voltage, constant current, constant resistance and constant power. For some demanding applications, these electronic load banks may offer fast slew rates and pulsed load profiles such as sine, square, triangle and ramp as well as internal capacitance, inductance, and time delay modes of operation. Today's most advanced programmable loads typically offer 16bit measurement and drive accuracy for superior performance.

*Sophisticated internal controls guard against oscillations and current spikes&lt;ref name="Experium Technologies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.experiumtech.com/Experium-Technologies/why-experium.html|title=High performance electronic programmable DC loads offer fast slew rates without unwanted current spikes|date=Nov 27, 2012|publisher=Experium Technologies/R Source Corporation|accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Przybylski's Star''' {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ᵻ|ˈ|b|ɪ|l|s|k|i|z}}, or '''HD 101065''', is a [[rapidly oscillating Ap star]] at roughly {{Convert|355|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} from the [[Sun]] in the southern [[constellation]] of [[Centaurus]].

==Scientific history==
In 1961, the Polish-Australian astronomer [[Antoni Przybylski]] discovered that this star had a peculiar spectrum that would not fit into the standard framework for [[stellar classification]].&lt;ref name=pasp75_445_349/&gt;&lt;ref name="DISC-20170630"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Powell |first1=C. S. |last2=Wright |first2=J. |title=The Strangest (and Second-Strangest) Star in the Galaxy |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2017/06/30/wright/ |date=30 June 2017 |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |accessdate=10 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Przybylski's observations indicated unusually low amounts of [[iron]] and [[nickel]] in the star's [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]], but higher amounts of unusual elements like [[strontium]], [[holmium]], [[niobium]], [[scandium]], [[yttrium]], [[caesium]], [[neodymium]], [[praseodymium]], [[thorium]], [[ytterbium]], and [[uranium]]. In fact, at first Przybylski doubted that iron was present in the spectrum at all. Modern work shows that the iron-group elements are somewhat below normal in abundance, but it is clear that the [[lanthanide]]s and other exotic elements are highly overabundant. Lanthanide elements are from 1000 to 10,000 times more abundant than in the Sun. As a result of these peculiar abundances this star belongs firmly in the [[Ap star]] class.

Przybylski's Star also contains many different short-lived [[actinide]] elements with [[actinium]], [[protactinium]], [[neptunium]], [[plutonium]], [[americium]], [[curium]], [[berkelium]], [[californium]], and [[einsteinium]] being detected. Other radioactive elements discovered in this star include [[technetium]] and [[promethium]].&lt;ref name=gopka08&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gopka |first1=V. F. |last2=Yushchenko |first2=A.

Compared to neighboring stars, HD&amp;nbsp;101065 has a high [[peculiar velocity]] of {{nowrap|23.8 ± 1.9 km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=mnras410_1_190/&gt;

==Odd theories==
Because of the odd properties of this star, there are numerous theories about why the oddities occur. The most interesting of them is that the star contains some long-lived nuclides from the [[island of stability]] (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;298&lt;/sup&gt;[[flerovium|Fl]], &lt;sup&gt;304&lt;/sup&gt;[[unbinilium|120]], or &lt;sup&gt;310&lt;/sup&gt;126) and that the observed short-lived actinides are the daughters of these progenitors, occurring in [[secular equilibrium]] with their parents.&lt;ref name=Isotope1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Isotope2/&gt;

==Properties==
HD 101065 is the prototype star of the [[rapidly oscillating Ap star]] (roAP) variable star class. In 1978, it was discovered to pulsate [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometrically]] with a period of 12.15 min.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode= 1978IBVS.1436....1K |title= 12.15 Minute Light Variations in Przybylski's Star, HD 101065 |journal= Information Bulletin on Variable Stars |volume= 1436 |pages= 1 |last1= Kurtz |first1= D. W. |year= 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential companion had also been detected, a 14th magnitude star (in infrared) 8 arc seconds away.  This would be a separation of nearly 1,000 AU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201118538 |arxiv = 1208.0480 |bibcode = 2012A&amp;A...545A..38S |title = Multiplicity of rapidly oscillating Ap stars |journal = Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |volume = 545 |pages = A38 |year = 2012 |last1 = Schöller |first1 = M. |last2 = Correia |first2 = S. |last3 = Hubrig |first3 = S. |last4 = Kurtz |first4 = D. W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Gaia Data Release 2]] suggests that this star lies at a distance of {{val|890|90}} light-years, more than twice the distance of Przybylski's Star.&lt;ref name=GaiaDR2comp/&gt;

'''''Questions of Truth''''' is a book by [[John Polkinghorne]] and Nicholas Beale which offers their responses to 51 questions about science and religion. The foreword is contributed by [[Antony Hewish]].

The book was launched at a workshop at the 2009 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] Annual Meeting in Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/meetings/2009/program/schedule/workshops/workshops.shtml AAAS Annual Meeting 2009 Workshop Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304021809/http://www.aaas.org/meetings/2009/program/schedule/workshops/workshops.shtml |date=March 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in the UK at a discussion at the [[Royal Society]] chaired by [[Onora O'Neill]], in a week when it was also featured on the [[Today Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7918000/7918145.stm Interview with] [[John Polkinghorne]] by [[John Humphrys]] [[BBC]] [[Today Programme]] 2-Mar-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key themes and ideas==
[[File:AAAS Launch workshop1 m.JPG|thumb|upright|Launch at 2009 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] Annual Conference with President [[James J. McCarthy]] (standing) and authors]]
The book grew out of questions generated at a website organized to communicate Polkinghorne's ideas. It groups selected questions under seven topics:&lt;ref name="PWorld"&gt;[http://www.questionsoftruth.org/reviews/review-in-physics-world/ One Scientist's Faith] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415035123/http://www.questionsoftruth.org/reviews/review-in-physics-world/ |date=April 15, 2009 }} review in ''[[Physics World]]'' April-2009&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Leading Questions'' gives an overview of Polkinghorne's views on nine questions, including science and religion, the existence of God, and atheism.
# ''The Concept and Existence of God'' begins with "Can God's existence be proved?" and addresses ''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[omniscience]], [[predestination]] and [[the Trinity]].
# ''The Universe'' considers the [[Big Bang]], the [[Anthropic Principle]] and a [[Theory of Everything]].
# ''Evolution'' starts with "Is evolution a fact or a theory?", discusses [[Intelligent Design]], which is deemed an unfortunate use of language and a theological mistake, and explores whether the mind can be explained by evolution.
# ''Evil'' suggests that "The evil that is not the result of human sin seems to be the result of the workings out of the natural laws of physics and biology" and considers the [[Devil]], cancer and [[Original Sin]].
# ''Human Being'' suggests that [[Adam and Eve]] refer to the first spiritually conscious human beings, that the [[soul]] is something ''logically'' distinct from the body but not a separate physical entity, and that [[conscience]] is "our deepest understanding of right and wrong".
# ''Religion'' begins with "Is atheism a form of faith?", suggests that "For each part of the Bible you have to ask what kind of writing it is and what God is trying to tell us through it", and considers the [[Resurrection]] and that "God will not force us to accept his love ... [but] will save everyone he can - no-one will be excluded because God did not want them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.truthquestion.com|title=Truth theory|last=Sahgal|first=Gita|date=|website=|publisher=Indian Times|access-date=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each question is followed by the responses of Beale and Polkinghorne, sometimes as a single answer and sometimes by the two authors individually. Its three appendixes constitute a third of the book:&lt;ref name="PWorld"/&gt;
* ''Anthropic Fine-Tuning'' draws on [[Martin Rees]]'s book ''Just Six Numbers'' to illustrate the point that if the fundamental constants of physics were slightly different then no intelligent life could exist in the Universe. It then considers [[Multiverse]] ideas and especially [[Lee Smolin]]'s [[Cosmological natural selection]], which, it suggests, has problems from physics and evolutionary dynamics. It also discusses notions of complexity and improbability.
* ''Brain and Consciousness'' suggests that "pretty much everything in the universe has a physical aspect and an informational aspect, neither of which is more foundational than the other", and that informational entities like the [[Mass in B Minor]] cannot be considered as material objects. It proposes that "your body and your mind are different aspects of you", and that the inherent uncertainties of neuron firing mean that the brain is not fully deterministic.
* ''Evolution'' begins by pointing out that since [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] Christians have not taken the Genesis creation accounts "literally", and that key developers of the current theory (e.g. [[Gregor Mendel]], [[Ronald Fisher]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], [[Simon Conway-Morris]] and [[Martin Nowak]]) have been Christians, suggesting that there is no conflict between Christianity and evolution, that small genetic changes can have big effects, that [[genetic determinism]] is mistaken, and that there are evolutionary benefits to religion.

==Reviews==

[[Julian Baggini]], writing in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', said that Polkinghorne has no problems reconciling his faith with his science and suggests that "despite the complexity of some of the scientific issues discussed", the book "is a commendably clear read".  He says "it is a pity that the people most likely to buy this book are those simply seeking intellectual reassurance that their faith is not irrational.  Those who would most benefit from reading it are in fact fundamentalists who think that evolutionary science must be wrong, and overconfident atheists who believe that the religious are manifestly irrational.” &lt;ref name = "FT"&gt;[[Julian Baggini]] "A Twist of Faith: How to reconcile religious belief with science" ''Financial Times'' Life and Arts, p.16, 21 Feb.,'09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Julian Baggini|Baggini]]'s [http://blog.talkingphilosophy.com/?p=708#comments additional comments on his talkingphilosophy site and the subsequent discussion]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. C. Grayling]] wrote a highly critical review in the ''[[New Humanist]]''. He states that the responses to questions concerning science and religion boil down to three strategies, [[God of the gaps]], [[inference to the best explanation]], and religion and science explain truths in [[non-overlapping magisteria|different domains]]. He considers the first two refutable by undergraduates, and for the third strategy to work, he contends that one has to "cherry-pick which bits of scripture and dogma are to be taken as symbolic and which as literally true" in order to conveniently avoid the possibility of direct and testable confrontation with science. He concludes the review by expressing his outrage at the [[Royal Society]]'s decision to allow its premises to be used for the launch of the book, as in his opinion this amounts to having "the superstitious lucubrations of illiterate goatherds living several thousand years ago given the same credibility as contemporary scientific research."&lt;ref name="NH"&gt;A. C. Grayling: [http://newhumanist.org.uk/1998 Book Review: Questions of Truth]. ''New Humanist'' 124 (2), March/April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Physics World]]'' commends the authors for handling the diverse readership, skeptics and believers, in a "remarkably even-handed way", but laments that concerns with specifics of Christian doctrine may limit the book's appeal; however, scientifically minded readers may find the extensive appendices a good starting point. The reviewer concludes that the book provides valuable insight for those interested in the science and religion debate.&lt;ref name="PWorld"/&gt;

In addition, some periodicals have included brief reviews. &lt;!-- These are all less than a paragraph on the book. --&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said, "Many readers will welcome this accessible format, but some may find the blurring of science and theology confusing."&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6612221.html?industryid=47159 Publishers Weekly Review]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Library Journal]]'' described it as intriguing and a thought-provoking work, and said that [[John Polkinghorne]] was a “a kind of antidote to [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] for the intellectual theist or Christian."&lt;ref name="lj"&gt;[http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6625530.html?industryid=47110 Library Journal Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305095840/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6625530.html?industryid=47110 |date=March 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Episcopal Life'' says the book offers "some interesting conclusions".&lt;ref name="EL"&gt;[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/81827_105251_ENG_HTM.htm Episcopal Life 3-Mar-09] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312123834/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/81827_105251_ENG_HTM.htm |date=March 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Sample, reflecting over his interview with Polkinghorne for ''[[The Guardian]]'', stated that there was much in the book that he found offensive, especially the idea that God needs to remain [[divine hiddenness|hidden]] from his creation lest they be completely overwhelmed, a notion Sample describes as "a bit patronising".&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web | work=The Guardian | last=Sample | first=Ian | accessdate=19 January 2010 | date=9 April 2009 | title=Can science be used to prove the existence of God? | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/apr/09/religion-controversiesinscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, [[Pawan Kalyan]] agreed to act in a film produced by Sharrath Marar, the former CEO of [[MAA TV]], after completing work on [[Trivikram Srinivas]]' ''[[Attarintiki Daredi]]'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Sharath-Marar-to-produce-Pawan-Kalyans-next/articleshow/16756753.cms|title=Sharath Marar to produce Pawan Kalyan’s next|last=Pasupulate|first=Karthik|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=10 October 2012|accessdate=16 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816153344/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Sharath-Marar-to-produce-Pawan-Kalyans-next/articleshow/16756753.cms?|archivedate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the theatrical release of ''[[Dabangg 2]]'' (2012), producer [[Bandla Ganesh]] registered the title ''Gabbar Singh in Hyderabad'' at the Andhra Pradesh Film Chamber which fuelled speculations that this would be the remake of ''Dabangg 2'' and the sequel of ''[[Gabbar Singh (film)|Gabbar Singh]]'' (2012), which itself was the official Telugu remake of ''[[Dabangg (2010 film)|Dabangg]]'' featuring Kalyan, [[Shruti Haasan]] and [[Abhimanyu Singh]] reprising the respective roles played by [[Salman Khan]], [[Sonakshi Sinha]] and [[Sonu Sood]] in the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Will-Pawan-remake-Salman-Khans-Dabangg-2/articleshow/17694543.cms|title=Will Pawan remake Salman Khan’s Dabangg 2?|last=A.

[[Sampath Nandi]] was chosen to direct the film and Marar was announced to execute the film's production. At the same time, the film was reported to have a fresh storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Devi-Sri-Prasad-to-compose-tunes-for-Gabbar-Singh-2/articleshow/20699202.cms|title=Devi Sri Prasad to compose tunes for Gabbar Singh 2|work=The Times of India|date=21 July 2013|accessdate=16 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816153400/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Devi-Sri-Prasad-to-compose-tunes-for-Gabbar-Singh-2/articleshow/20699202.cms?|archivedate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides producing the film, Kalyan himself wrote the story and made it clear to his team that ''Gabbar Singh''{{'s}} sequel would be based on an original script and would not be a remake of ''Dabangg 2''. Considering the response generated by ''Attarintiki Daredi'' and the subsequent change in his on-screen image, Kalyan put the pre-production activities on hold and made changes to the script. Some elements of family drama were added and the aggression and expressions of the lead character were toned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/entertainment/south-masala/Total-makeover/articleshow/24673057.cms|title=Total makeover|last=Kamal|first=S.

The film was renamed to ''Sardaar'' in late July 2015 in order to avoid paying royalty to the title ''Gabbar Singh'' to a Mumbai-based studio that held the rights of the title.

[[File:Geistliche Schatzkammer Wienb.jpg|thumb|Ecclesiastical treasury in Vienna's [[Hofburg Palace]]]]
[[File:Juwelenzimmer 2 Grünes Gewölbe.jpg|thumb|The [[Green Vault]] in [[Dresden Castle]] (as at 1904)]]
'''''Schatzkammer''''', a German word which means ''treasury'' or ''treasure chamber'', is a term used in English for the collection of treasures, especially [[objet d'art]] in precious metals and jewels, of a ruler or other collector which are kept in a secure room and often found in the basement of a palace or castle. It also often included the wider types of object typical of the Renaissance [[cabinet of curiosities]].  A very small but evocative Renaissance room in a tower at [[Lacock Abbey]] was designed for keeping and viewing the treasures of the newly rich owner.

The term is normally used of the collections of European rulers or very wealthy families. Well-known examples are:

* The [[Imperial Treasury, Vienna|Imperial Treasury]] at the [[Hofburg Palace]] in Vienna, Austria.
* The collection of the royal regalia and treasures of the [[Bavaria]]n [[Wittelsbach]] dynasty, housed in the ''[[Residenz, Munich|Residenz]]'' Palace in [[Munich]], [[Germany]].
* The vast collection of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] [[Monarch]]s of [[Saxony]], kept in the ''[[Grünes Gewölbe]]'' at [[Dresden Castle]] in [[Dresden]], Germany.
* The [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]] in the [[Tower of London]].
* A display of Bourbon treasures in the basement of the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid.
* The [[Waddesdon Bequest]], a 19th-century collection of mostly Renaissance treasures now displayed together in the [[British Museum]].
* [[Rosenborg Castle]] in [[Copenhagen]] displays [[objet de vertu]] in silver, ivory and other precious materials, some in the cabinets and treasure rooms (porcelain room, glass room) specially constructed over the centuries by the [[Danish Royal Family|Kings of Denmark]] for their display.  The [[Crown Jewels]] and the [[Danish Crown Regalia]] are displayed in a series of modern galleries built inside an enormous vault in the basement. 

Church establishments also had treasuries where similar objects were kept, which are often now open as museums. Especially important and largely intact examples are:

* The [[Treasury of St. Vitus Cathedral]] in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]
* The [[Aachen Cathedral Treasury]] at the [[Aachen Cathedral]] (Germany), one of the most important collections of church cultural artefacts in Europe
* The treasury of [[San Marco]], [[Venice]], which retains a unique collection of [[Byzantine art]], looted during the [[Fourth Crusade]]

Examples outside Europe include:
* The Treasure Rooms of [[Topkapi Palace]] display Ottoman treasures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26061">'''Secretion''' is the movement of material from one point to another, e.g. secreted [[chemical substance]] from a [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[gland]]. In contrast, [[excretion]], is the removal of certain substances or waste products from a cell or organism. The classical mechanism of cell secretion is via secretory portals at the cell plasma membrane called [[porosomes]].&lt;ref name="pmid 22659300"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee JS, Jeremic A, Shin L, Cho WJ, Chen X, Jena BP | title = Neuronal porosome proteome: Molecular dynamics and architecture | journal = Journal of Proteomics | volume = 75 | issue = 13 | pages = 3952–62 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22659300 | doi = 10.1016/j.jprot.2012.05.017 | pmc = 4580231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Porosomes are permanent cup-shaped lipoprotein structure at the cell plasma membrane, where secretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse to release intra-vesicular contents from the cell.

[[Bacterial secretion system|Secretion in bacterial species]] means the transport or translocation of effector molecules for example: [[proteins]], [[enzymes]] or [[toxin]]s (such as [[cholera toxin]] in [[pathogenic bacteria]] for example ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'') from across the interior ([[cytoplasm]] or [[cytosol]]) of a bacterial cell to its exterior. Secretion is a very important mechanism in bacterial functioning and operation in their natural surrounding environment for adaptation and survival.

==In eukaryotic cells==
[[File:Porosome for wiki-2.jpg|thumb|240px|Porosome]]

===Mechanism===
[[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]], including [[human cells]], have a highly [[evolution|evolved]] process of secretion. Proteins [[Protein targeting|targeted]] for the outside are [[protein synthesis|synthesized]] by [[ribosome]]s docked to the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER). As they are synthesized, these proteins translocate into the ER [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], where they are [[Glycosylation|glycosylated]] and where molecular [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperone]]s aid [[protein folding]]. [[Misfolded proteins]] are usually identified here and retrotranslocated by [[Endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation|ER-associated degradation]] to the [[cytosol]], where they are degraded by a [[proteasome]]. The [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s containing the properly folded proteins then enter the [[Golgi apparatus]].

In the Golgi apparatus, the glycosylation of the proteins is modified and further [[posttranslational modifications]], including cleavage and functionalization, may occur. The [[proteins]] are then moved into secretory vesicles which travel along the [[cytoskeleton]] to the edge of the cell. More modification can occur in the secretory vesicles (for example [[insulin]] is cleaved from [[proinsulin]] in the secretory vesicles).

Eventually, there is [[vesicle fusion]] with the [[cell membrane]] at a structure called the [[porosome]], in a process called [[exocytosis]], dumping its contents out of the cell's environment.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson LL | title = Discovery of the 'porosome'; the universal secretory machinery in cells | journal = Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 126–31 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16563225 | doi = 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2006.tb00294.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strict [[biochemical]] control is maintained over this sequence by usage of a [[pH]] gradient: the pH of the cytosol is 7.4, the ER's pH is 7.0, and the cis-golgi has a pH of 6.5. Secretory vesicles have pHs ranging between 5.0 and 6.0; some secretory vesicles evolve into [[lysosome]]s, which have a pH of 4.8.

There are many proteins like [[FGF1]] (aFGF), [[FGF2]] (bFGF), [[interleukin-1]] (IL1) etc. which do not have a signal sequence. They do not use the classical ER-golgi pathway. These are secreted through various nonclassical pathways.

At least four nonclassical (unconventional) protein secretion pathways have been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nickel W, Seedorf M | title = Unconventional mechanisms of protein transport to the cell surface of eukaryotic cells | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 24 | pages = 287–308 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18590485 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.24.110707.175320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They include 1) direct translocation of proteins across the plasma membrane likely through membrane transporters, 2) blebbing, 3) lysosomal secretion, and 4) release via exosomes derived from multivesicular bodies. In addition, proteins can be released from cells by mechanical or physiological wounding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McNeil PL, Steinhardt RA | title = Plasma membrane disruption: repair, prevention, adaptation | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 19 | pages = 697–731 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14570587 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.19.111301.140101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and through nonlethal, transient oncotic pores in the plasma membrane induced by washing cells with serum-free media or buffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chirico WJ | title = Protein release through nonlethal oncotic pores as an alternative nonclassical secretory pathway | journal = BMC Cell Biology | volume = 12 | pages = 46 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 22008609 | pmc = 3217904 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2121-12-46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In human tissues===
Many [[human cell types]] have the ability to be secretory cells. They have a well-developed [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus]] to fulfill their function. [[Tissue (biology)|Tissues]] in humans that produce secretions include the [[gastrointestinal tract]] which secretes [[digestive enzyme]]s and [[gastric acid]], the [[lung]] which secretes [[surfactant]]s, and [[sebaceous gland]]s which secrete sebum to lubricate the skin and hair. [[Meibomian gland]]s in the eyelid secrete sebum to lubricate and protect the eye.

== In gram-negative bacteria==
{{main|Bacterial secretion system}}
Secretion is not unique to eukaryotes alone - it is present in bacteria and archaea as well. [[ATP binding cassette]] (ABC) type transporters are common to all the three domains of life. The Sec system constituting the Sec Y-E-G complex (see Type II secretion system (T2SS), below) is another conserved secretion system, homologous to the translocon in the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum and the Sec 61 translocon complex of yeast. Some secreted proteins are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane by the Sec translocon, which requires the presence of an N-terminal signal peptide on the secreted protein. Others are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane by the [[twin-arginine translocation pathway]] (Tat).  [[Gram-negative bacteria]] have two membranes, thus making secretion topologically more complex. There are at least six specialized secretion systems in gram-negative bacteria. Many secreted proteins are particularly important in bacterial pathogenesis.&lt;ref name= WooldridgeK&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Wooldridge |editor1-first=K |year=2009 |title=Bacterial Secreted Proteins: Secretory Mechanisms and Role in Pathogenesis |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-42-4}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type I secretion system (T1SS or TOSS)===
[[Image:T1SS.svg|200px|right]]
Type I secretion is a chaperone dependent secretion system employing the Hly and Tol gene clusters. The process begins as a leader sequence HlyA is recognized and binds HlyB on the membrane. This signal sequence is extremely specific for the ABC transporter. The HlyAB complex stimulates HlyD which begins to uncoil and reaches the outer membrane where TolC recognizes a terminal molecule or signal on HlyD. HlyD recruits TolC to the inner membrane and HlyA is excreted outside of the outer membrane via a long-tunnel protein channel.

Type I secretion system transports various molecules, from ions, drugs, to proteins of various sizes (20 – 900 kDa). The molecules secreted vary in size from the small ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' peptide colicin V, (10 kDa) to the ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'' cell adhesion protein LapA of 520 kDa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyd CD, Smith TJ, El-Kirat-Chatel S, Newell PD, Dufrêne YF, O'Toole GA | title = Structural features of the Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilm adhesin LapA required for LapG-dependent cleavage, biofilm formation, and cell surface localization | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 196 | issue = 15 | pages = 2775–88 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24837291 | pmc = 4135675 | doi = 10.1128/JB.01629-14 | url = http://jb.asm.org/content/196/15/2775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best characterized are the [[RTX toxin]]s and the lipases. Type I secretion is also involved in export of non-proteinaceous substrates like cyclic β-glucans and polysaccharides.

[[Image:T2SS.svg|200px|left]]

===Type II secretion system (T2SS)===
{{Main article|Type II secretion system}}
Proteins secreted through the type II system, or main terminal branch of the general secretory pathway, depend on the Sec or Tat system for initial transport into the [[periplasm]]. Once there, they pass through the outer membrane via a multimeric (12–14 subunits) complex of pore forming secretin proteins. In addition to the secretin protein, 10–15 other inner and outer membrane proteins compose the full secretion apparatus, many with as yet unknown function. Gram-negative [[Pilus#Type IV pili|type IV pili]] use a modified version of the type II system for their biogenesis, and in some cases certain proteins are shared between a pilus complex and type II system within a single bacterial species.

===Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)===
{{Main article|Type three secretion system}}
[[Image:T3SS.svg|200px|right]]
It is homologous to the basal body in bacterial flagella. It is like a molecular syringe through which a bacterium (e.g. certain types of ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Yersinia]]'', ''[[Vibrio]]'') can inject proteins into eukaryotic cells. The low Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in the cytosol opens the gate that regulates T3SS. One such mechanism to detect low calcium concentration has been illustrated by the lcrV (Low Calcium Response) antigen utilized by ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', which is used to detect low calcium concentrations and elicits T3SS attachment. The Hrp system in plant pathogens inject harpins and pathogen effector proteins through similar mechanisms into plants. This secretion system was first discovered in ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' and showed that toxins could be injected directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cytoplasm of its host's cells rather than simply be secreted into the extracellular medium.&lt;ref&gt;Salyers, A.

It is homologous to [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] machinery of bacteria. It is capable of transporting both DNA and proteins. It was discovered in ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'', which uses this system to introduce the T-DNA portion of the Ti plasmid into the plant host, which in turn causes the affected area to develop into a crown gall (tumor). ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' uses a type IV secretion system to deliver [[CagA]] into gastric epithelial cells, which is associated with gastric carcinogenesis.&lt;ref name="pmid16367902"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hatakeyama M, Higashi H | title = Helicobacter pylori CagA: a new paradigm for bacterial carcinogenesis | journal = Cancer Science | volume = 96 | issue = 12 | pages = 835–43 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16367902 | doi = 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00130.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]'', the causative agent of whooping cough, secretes the [[pertussis toxin]] partly through the type IV system.

==== Function ====
In short, Type IV secretion system (T4SS), is the general mechanism by which bacterial cells secrete or take up macromolecules. Their precise mechanism remains unknown. T4SS is encoded on [[Gram negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] conjugative elements in [[bacteria]].T4SS are cell envelope-spanning complexes or in other words 11–13 core proteins that form a channel through which DNA and proteins can travel from the cytoplasm of the donor cell to the cytoplasm of the recipient cell. Additionally, T4SS also secrete [[virulence]] factor proteins directly into host cells as well as taking up DNA from the medium during natural [[Transformation (bacteria)|transformation]], which shows the versatility of this macromolecular secretion apparatus.&lt;ref name="pmid12855161"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawley TD, Klimke WA, Gubbins MJ, Frost LS | title = F factor conjugation is a true type IV secretion system | journal = FEMS Microbiology Letters | volume = 224 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12855161 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-1097(03)00430-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Structure ====
As shown in the above figure, TraC, in particular consists of a three helix bundle and a loose globular appendage.&lt;ref name="pmid14673074" /&gt;

==== Interactions ====
T4SS has two effector proteins: firstly, ATS-1, which stands for Anaplasma translocated substrate 1, and secondly [[Ankyrin repeat|AnkA]], which stands for ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein A. Additionally, T4SS coupling proteins are VirD4, which bind to VirE2.&lt;ref name="pmid20670295"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rikihisa Y, Lin M, Niu H | title = Type IV secretion in the obligatory intracellular bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum | journal = Cellular Microbiology | volume = 12 | issue = 9 | pages = 1213–21 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20670295 | pmc = 3598623 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-5822.2010.01500.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type V secretion system (T5SS)===
{{See also|Trimeric autotransporter adhesin#Type V secretion system (T5SS)}}
[[Image:T5SS.svg|250px|right]]
Also called the autotransporter system,&lt;ref name=Thanassi2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thanassi DG, Stathopoulos C, Karkal A, Li H | title = Protein secretion in the absence of ATP: the autotransporter, two-partner secretion and chaperone/usher pathways of gram-negative bacteria (review) | journal = Molecular Membrane Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 63–72 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16092525 | doi = 10.1080/09687860500063290 }}&lt;/ref&gt; type V secretion involves use of the ''Sec'' system for crossing the inner membrane. Proteins which use this pathway have the capability to form a beta-barrel with their C-terminus which inserts into the outer membrane, allowing the rest of the peptide (the passenger domain) to reach the outside of the cell. Often, autotransporters are cleaved, leaving the beta-barrel domain in the outer membrane and freeing the passenger domain. Some researchers believe remnants of the autotransporters gave rise to the porins which form similar beta-barrel structures.&lt;ref name="Friesland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friesland, Brooke et al |title=Structural analysis of autotransporter components and the origin of porins |journal=Int J Mol Biochem |date=2011 |volume=29 |issue=13 |pages=92-112}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common example of an autotransporter that uses this secretion system is the [[Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins (TAA)|Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins]].&lt;ref name="pmid17482513"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerlach RG, Hensel M | title = Protein secretion systems and adhesins: the molecular armory of Gram-negative pathogens | journal = International Journal of Medical Microbiology | volume = 297 | issue = 6 | pages = 401–15 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17482513 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijmm.2007.03.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type VI secretion system (T6SS)===
{{Main article|Type VI secretion system}}

Type VI secretion systems  were originally identified in 2006 by the group of John Mekalanos at the Harvard Medical School (Boston, USA) in two bacterial pathogens, ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid16432199"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pukatzki S, Ma AT, Sturtevant D, Krastins B, Sarracino D, Nelson WC, Heidelberg JF, Mekalanos JJ | title = Identification of a conserved bacterial protein secretion system in Vibrio cholerae using the Dictyostelium host model system | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 103 | issue = 5 | pages = 1528–33 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16432199 | pmc = 1345711 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0510322103 | bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.1528P | jstor = 30048406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16763151"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mougous JD, Cuff ME, Raunser S, Shen A, Zhou M, Gifford CA, Goodman AL, Joachimiak G, Ordoñez CL, Lory S, Walz T, Joachimiak A, Mekalanos JJ | title = A virulence locus of Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes a protein secretion apparatus | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5779 | pages = 1526–30 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16763151 | pmc = 2800167 | doi = 10.1126/science.1128393 | bibcode = 2006Sci...312.1526M }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were identified when mutations in the Hcp and VrgG genes in ''Vibrio Cholerae'' led to decreased virulence and pathogenicity. Since then, Type VI secretion systems have been found in a quarter of all proteobacterial genomes, including animal, plant, human pathogens, as well as soil, environmental or marine bacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid18289922"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bingle LE, Bailey CM, Pallen MJ | title = Type VI secretion: a beginner's guide | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–8 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18289922 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2008.01.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18617888"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cascales E | title = The type VI secretion toolkit | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 735–41 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18617888 | pmc = 2515208 | doi = 10.1038/embor.2008.131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the early studies of Type VI secretion focused on its role in the pathogenesis of higher organisms, more recent studies suggested a broader physiological role in defense against simple eukaryotic predators and its role in inter-bacteria interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwarz S, Hood RD, Mougous JD | title = What is type VI secretion doing in all those bugs? | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 18 | issue = 12 | pages = 531–7 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20961764 | pmc = 2991376 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2010.09.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coulthurst 2013 S0923-2508"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coulthurst SJ | title = The Type VI secretion system - a widespread and versatile cell targeting system | journal = Research in Microbiology | volume = 164 | issue = 6 | pages = 640–54 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23542428 | doi = 10.1016/j.resmic.2013.03.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Type VI secretion system gene clusters contain from 15 to more than 20 genes, two of which, Hcp and VgrG, have been shown to be nearly universally secreted substrates of the system.

===Release of outer membrane vesicles===
In addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above, Gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material: the formation of [[bacterial outer membrane vesicles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuehn MJ, Kesty NC | title = Bacterial outer membrane vesicles and the host-pathogen interaction | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 19 | issue = 22 | pages = 2645–55 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16291643 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1299905 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of the outer membrane pinch off, forming nano-scale spherical structures made of a lipopolysaccharide-rich lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials, and are deployed for [[membrane vesicle trafficking]] to manipulate environment or invade at [[host-pathogen interface]].  Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors, some have immunomodulatory effects, and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells. release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions, the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McBroom AJ, Kuehn MJ | title = Release of outer membrane vesicles by Gram-negative bacteria is a novel envelope stress response | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pages = 545–58 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17163978 | pmc = 1868505 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05522.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space Weather Segment==
The main objective of the Space Weather Segment (SWE) is to detect and forecast of [[space weather]] events, avoid adverse effect on European space assets and ground-based infrastructure. To achieve that, the segment will focus on delivery of real-time space weather information, forecasts and warnings, supported by a data archive, applications and services. Assets currently available for the segment consist of multiple ground-based and spaceborne sensors monitoring the Sun, [[solar wind]] and Earth's [[magnetosphere]], [[ionosphere]] and [[thermosphere]]. These include the [[PROBA2]] satellite and the [[Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory]]. The segment is jointly coordinated by the SWE Data Centre located at the [[ESTRACK]] [[Redu Station]] and the SSA Space Weather Coordination Centre (SSCC), both in [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=swe&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Space_Weather_-_SWE_Segment|title=SWE Segment|access-date=2015-05-03|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Near-Earth Object Segment==
The [[near-Earth object]] segment aims to deliver monitoring and warning of potential [[Impact event|Earth impactors]] and tracking of newly discovered objects. The segment's current assets consist of a mixture of professional and amateur telescopes, including the [[OGS Telescope]], that are supported by tracking databases. The plans are to create a fully integrated system supporting alerts for civil authorities. The segment is operated by the SSA NEO Coordination Centre located at the [[ESA Centre for Earth Observation]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=neo&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Near-Earth_Objects_-_NEO_Segment |title=NEO Segment| access-date=2015-05-03| publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space Surveillance and Tracking Segment==
The SST segment's primary goal is the detection, cataloguing and orbit prediction of objects orbiting the Earth. It is part of an effort to avoid collisions between orbiting satellites and debris, provide safe reentries, detect on-orbit explosions, assist missions at launch, deployment and end-of-life and overall reduce cost of space access. The segment currently relies on existing European radar and optical systems. Some of its assets are existing [[radio telescope|radio]] and [[optical telescopes]], with now serving a secondary role for tracking space debris.&lt;ref name=sst&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Space_Surveillance_and_Tracking_-_SST_Segment| title=SST Segment| access-date=2015-05-03| publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radar-based SST assets are split into two categories: surveillance and tracking systems. SSA SST radar systems include:&lt;ref name=sst-radars&gt;{{cite web|url = https://sst.ssa.esa.int/cwbi/general/radar_sens.xhtml| title=Europe’s Radar Space Surveillance and Tracking Sensors| access-date=2015-05-03| publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study calculated the impact of injecting sulfate particles, or [[aerosols]], every one to four years into the [[stratosphere]] in amounts equal to those lofted by the volcanic eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = T.

It has been suggested that the direct delivery of precursors could be achieved using sulfide gases such as [[dimethyl sulfide]], [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|S|O|2}}), [[carbonyl sulfide]], or [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}).&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt; These compounds would be delivered using artillery, aircraft (such as the high-flying [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15C]])&lt;ref name="aircraft"/&gt; or balloons, and result in the formation of compounds with the sulfate [[anion]] SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;

According to estimates, "one kilogram of well placed sulfur in the stratosphere would roughly offset the warming effect of several hundred thousand kilograms of carbon dioxide."&lt;ref name="CFR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/18635/|title=The Geoengineering Option:A Last Resort Against Global Warming? |author=[[David G.

==Arguments for the technique==

The arguments in favour of this approach in comparison to other possible means of solar radiation management are:

* '''Mimics a natural process''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last2 = Lamb| first1 = S. S.| first2 = B. K.| last3 = Guenther| last4 = Dignon| last5 = Stoiber | first3 = A.| first4 = J.| first5 = R. E.| title = Sulfur emissions to the atmosphere from natural sources| journal = Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry| volume = 14| pages = 315–337| year = 1992| last1 = Bates| doi = 10.1007/BF00115242| bibcode = 1992JAtC...14..315B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stratospheric sulfur aerosols are created by existing natural processes (especially [[volcanoes]]), whose impacts have been studied via observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = J.| last2 = Turco | first2 = R. P.| first3 = O. B.| title = A model simulation of Pinatubo volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere| last1 = Zhao| last3 = Toon| journal = Journal of Geophysical Research| volume = 100| pages = 7315–7328| year = 1995| doi = 10.1029/94JD03325| bibcode=1995JGR...100.7315Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with other, more speculative solar radiation management techniques which do not have natural analogs (e.g., [[space sunshade]]).
* '''Technological feasibility''': In contrast to other proposed solar radiation management techniques, such as [[marine cloud brightening]] and space sunshades, much of the required technology is pre-existing: [[chemical manufacturing]], [[artillery shells]], high-altitude aircraft, [[weather balloons]], etc.&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt;
* '''Cost''': Numerous studies have concluded that SAI would cost less than many other interventions.  Costs cannot be derived in a wholly objective fashion, as pricing can only be roughly estimated at an early stage. However, many sources suggest that it would be cheap relative to cutting emissions, capturing carbon dioxide, adapting to climate impacts, or suffering climate damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126973.600-hacking-the-planet-the-only-climate-solution-left.html?full=true|title=Hacking the planet: The only climate solution left?

* '''Efficacy''': Most proposed solar radiation management techniques can only provide a limited intervention in the climate—one cannot reduce the temperature by more than a certain amount with each technique.  Research has suggested that this technique may have a high radiative 'forcing potential'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/9/2559/2009/acpd-9-2559-2009.pdf|title=Radiative forcing potential of climate geoengineering|last=Lenton|first=Tim|author2=Vaughan|accessdate=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy issues==

It is uncertain how effective any solar radiation management technique would be, due to the difficulties modeling their impacts and the complex nature of the global [[climate system]].  Certain efficacy issues are specific to stratospheric aerosols.

*'''Lifespan of aerosols''': Tropospheric sulfur aerosols are short lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_/ai_12140641 | work=Science News | title=Haze clouds the greenhouse—sulfur pollution slows global warming—includes related article | first=Richard | last=Monastersky | year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Delivery of particles into the lower stratosphere in the arctic will typically ensure that they remain aloft only for a few weeks or months, as air in this region is predominantly descending.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crosswalk.com/news/11572945/&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure endurance, higher-altitude delivery is needed, ensuring a typical endurance of several years by enabling injection into the rising leg of the [[Brewer-Dobson circulation]] above the tropical [[tropopause]]. Further, sizing of particles is crucial to their endurance.&lt;ref name="particle size"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = P. J.| last2 = Crutzen | first2 = P. J.| first3 = D. B.| title = Exploring the geoengineering of climate using stratospheric sulfate aerosols: the role of particle size| last1 = Rasch| last3 = Coleman| journal = Geophysical Research Letters| volume = 35| issue =  2| pages = L02809| year = 2008| doi = 10.1029/2007GL032179|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1038603| bibcode=2008GeoRL..3502809R}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Aerosol delivery''': There are two proposals for how to create a stratospheric sulfate aerosol cloud, either through release of a precursor gas ({{chem|S|O|2}}) or the direct release of sulfuric acid ({{chem|H|2|S|O|4}}) and these face different challenges.&lt;ref name="Pierce L18805"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Efficient formation of stratospheric aerosol for climate engineering by emission of condensible vapor from aircraft|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010GL043975/abstract|journal = Geophysical Research Letters|date = 2010-09-01|issn = 1944-8007|pages = L18805|volume = 37|issue = 18|doi = 10.1029/2010GL043975|language = en|first = Jeffrey R.|last = Pierce|first2 = Debra K.|last2 = Weisenstein|first3 = Patricia|last3 = Heckendorn|first4 = Thomas|last4 = Peter|first5 = David W.|last5 = Keith|bibcode = 2010GeoRL..3718805P}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{chem|S|O|2}} gas is released it will oxidise to form {{chem|H|2|S|O|4}} and then condense to form droplets far from the injection site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The dependency of geoengineered sulfate aerosol on the emission strategy|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asl.304/abstract|journal = Atmospheric Science Letters|date = 2011-04-01|issn = 1530-261X|pages = 189–194|volume = 12|issue = 2|doi = 10.1002/asl.304|language = en|first = U.|last = Niemeier|first2 = H.|last2 = Schmidt|first3 = C.|last3 = Timmreck}}&lt;/ref&gt; Releasing {{chem|S|O|2}} would not allow control over the size of the particles that are formed but would not require a sophisticated release mechanism. Simulations suggest that as the {{chem|S|O|2}} release rate is increased there would be diminishing returns on the cooling effect, as larger particles would be formed which have a shorter lifetime and are less effective scatterers of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACP - Peer review - What is the limit of climate engineering by stratospheric injection of SO2?|url = http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/15/9129/2015/acp-15-9129-2015-discussion.html|website = www.atmos-chem-phys.net|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{chem|H|2|S|O|4}} is released directly then the aerosol particles would form very quickly and in principle the particle size could be controlled although the engineering requirements for this are uncertain. As direct {{chem|H|2|S|O|4}} release would allow control over the particle size it could be possible to avoid some of the inefficiencies associated with {{chem|S|O|2}} release.&lt;ref name="Pierce L18805"/&gt;

==Possible side effects==
{{Main|Stratospheric sulfur aerosols#Effects}}
Climate engineering and solar radiation management in general are controversial, and pose various problems and risks. However, certain problems are specific to, or more pronounced with this particular technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = A.| title = 20 reasons why geoengineering may be a bad idea| journal = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists| volume = 64| issue = 2| pages = 14–19| year = 2008| last1 = Robock| doi = 10.2968/064002006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Ozone depletion]]''': is a potential side effect of sulfur aerosols;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = A. | last1 = Tabazadeh| last2 = Drdla | first2 = K. | last4 = Hamill | first4 = P.| last3 = Schoeberl | first3 = R. | first5 = B. | last5 = Toon| title = Arctic "ozone hole" in a cold volcanic stratosphere| url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11854461| format = Free full text| journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]| volume = 99| issue = 5| pages = 2609–2612| date=Mar 2002 | issn = 0027-8424| pmid = 11854461| pmc = 122395| doi = 10.1073/pnas.052518199|bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.2609T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cosis.net"&gt;http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2008/10823/EGU2008-A-10823.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and these concerns have been supported by modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/045108|title=The impact of geoengineering aerosols on stratospheric temperature and ozone|year=2009|last1=Heckendorn|first1=P|last2=Weisenstein|first2=D|last3=Fueglistaler|first3=S|last4=Luo|first4=B P|last5=Rozanov|first5=E|last6=Schraner|first6=M|last7=Thomason|first7=L W|last8=Peter|first8=T|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=4|issue=4|pages=045108|bibcode=2009ERL.....4d5108H}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may only occur if high enough quantities of aerosols drift to, or are deposited in, [[Polar stratospheric clouds]] before the levels of [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFCs]] and other ozone destroying gases fall naturally to safe levels because stratospheric aerosols, together with the ozone destroying gases, are responsible for ozone depletion.&lt;ref name="protecting_the_planet"&gt;{{cite journal

*'''Whitening of the sky''': Stratospheric aerosols have the potential to whiten the sky and cause more colorful sunsets, dependent on the amount being sprayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Olson, D. W., R. L. Doescher, and M. S. Olson |title=When the Sky Ran Red: The Story Behind The Scream |journal=Sky &amp; Telescope |pages=29–35 |date=February 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study on cleaner air, resulting [[solar brightening]] has been responsible for an increase in corn production over the past 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/mar/21/a-bright-sun-today-its-down-to-the-atmosphere|title=A bright sun today?

*'''[[Tropopause]] warming''': and the humidification of the stratosphere.&lt;ref name="cosis.net"/&gt;
*'''Regional warming''': Based on the results of the 2014-2015 Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project, a model with a standard stratospheric aerosol injection scenario, temperatures in the tropics would cool, and higher latitudes warm, ice sheet, and [[Arctic sea ice decline]] would still continue, albeit at a reduced rate. Extreme temperature anomalies would also still increase, but to a lesser degree. In regards to these model results, the author of the study [[Alan Robock]] noted:

{{quote|If geoengineering were halted all at once, there would be rapid temperature and precipitation increases at 5–10 times the rates from gradual global warming.&lt;ref name=Robock2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/RobockStratAerosolGeo.pdf|title=Stratospheric Aerosol Geoengineering|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|year=2015|author=Alan Robock|doi=10.1063/1.4916181}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* '''Stratospheric temperature change''': Aerosols can also absorb some radiation from the Sun, the Earth and the surrounding atmosphere. This changes the surrounding air temperature and could potentially impact on the stratospheric circulation, which in turn may impact the surface circulation.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Ferraro, A. J., Highwood, E. J., Charlton-Perez, A. J. |title=Stratospheric heating by geoengineering aerosols |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=37 |issue= 24|pages=L24706 |year=2011 |doi=10.1029/2011GL049761|bibcode = 2011GeoRL..3824706F }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Regional hydrologic responses''': Based on the results of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project, there would be a reduction in the global average precipitation around the world, particularly in summer monsoon regions.&lt;ref name=Robock2014 /&gt;
*'''Health effects''': Whilst the sulfate particles are natural, they still have potential health effects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4102961&lt;/ref&gt; Minimising these effects is principally achieved by ensuring the particles stay aloft as long as possible, thus reducing the tonnages returning into the lower atmosphere.

==Aerosol formation==

Primary aerosol formation, also known as homogeneous aerosol formation, results when gaseous {{chem|S|O|2}} combines with oxygen and water to form [[aqueous]] [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  This acidic liquid solution is in the form of a [[vapor]] and [[condenses]] onto particles of solid matter, either [[meteor]]itic in origin or from dust carried from the surface to the stratosphere.  Secondary or heterogeneous [[aerosol]] formation occurs when H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; vapor condenses onto existing aerosol particles.  Existing aerosol particles or [[droplets]] also run into each other, creating larger particles or droplets in a process known as [[coagulation]]. Warmer atmospheric temperatures also lead to larger particles. These larger particles would be less effective at scattering [[sunlight]] because the peak light scattering is achieved by particles with a diameter of 0.3 μm.&lt;ref name="aerosols"&gt;{{cite journal

==Methods==
Various techniques have been proposed for delivering the aerosol precursor gases (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and {{chem|S|O|2}}).&lt;ref name=Crutzen06&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = P.

* '''Civilian aircraft''' including the Boeing 747-400 and Gulfstream G550/650, C-37A could be modified at relatively low cost to deliver sufficient amounts of required material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McClellan |first1=Justin |last2=Keith |first2=David |last3=Apt |first3=Jay |title=Cost Analysis of Stratospheric Albedo Modification Delivery Systems |journal=Environmental Research Letters |date=30 August 2012 |volume=7 |issue=3 |page=3 in 1–8 |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/7/3/034019 |url= http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/7/3/034019/ |accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Military aircraft''' such as the F15-C variant of the [[F-15 Eagle]] have the necessary [[flight ceiling]], but limited payload. Military tanker aircraft such as the [[KC-135 Stratotanker]] and [[KC-10 Extender]] also have the necessary ceiling and have greater payload capacity.&lt;ref name="aircraft" /&gt;
* Modified '''[[artillery]]''' might have the necessary capability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0601409|title=PARAMETRIC STUDIES ON USE OF BOOSTED ARTILLERY PROJECTILES FOR HIGH ALTITUDE RESEARCH PROBES, PROJECT HARP,|last=PICATINNY ARSENAL DOVER N J|accessdate=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but requires a polluting and expensive [[Smokeless powder|gunpowder]] charge to loft the payload. [[Railgun]] artillery could be a non-polluting alternative.
*'''[[High-altitude balloon]]s''' can be used to lift precursor gases, in tanks, bladders or in the balloons' envelope.  Balloons can also be used to lift pipes and hoses, but no [[moored balloon]] has ever been deployed to the necessary altitude.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Material options===
Precursor gases such as [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]] have been considered.  Use of gaseous [[sulfuric acid]] appears to reduce the problem of aerosol growth.&lt;ref name="doi10.1029/2010GL043975"/&gt; Materials such as [[photophoretic]] particles, titanium dioxide, and diamond are also under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=David W.|title=Photophoretic levitation of engineered aerosols for geoengineering|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|date=2010|volume=107|issue=38|pages=16428–16431|doi=10.1073/pnas.1009519107|pmid=20823254|pmc=2944714|bibcode=2010PNAS..10716428K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=D.W. and D.

===Injection system===
The latitude and distribution of injection locations has been discussed by various authors.  Whilst a near-equatorial injection regime will allow particles to enter the rising leg of the [[Brewer-Dobson circulation]], several studies have concluded that a broader, and higher-latitude, injection regime will reduce injection mass flow rates and/or yield climatic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = English | first1 = J.

==Outdoors research==
Almost all work to date on stratospheric sulfate injection has been limited to modelling and laboratory work. A Russian team tested aerosol formation in the lower troposphere using helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Izrael|first1=Yuri|journal= Russian Meteorology and Hydrology|date=2009|volume=34|issue=10|pages=635–638|doi=10.3103/S106837390910001X|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3103%2FS106837390910001X|accessdate=8 June 2015|display-authors=etal|title=Field studies of a geo-engineering method of maintaining a modern climate with aerosol particles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering]] (SPICE) project planned on a limited field test in order to evaluate a potential delivery system, but this component of the project was canceled. In 2015, a group based at Harvard University has described a potential field experiment to test the possible damage to stratospheric ozone from stratospheric sulfate injection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dykema|first1=John A.|title=Stratospheric controlled perturbation experiment: a small-scale experiment to improve understanding of the risks of solar geoengineering|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A|date=2014|volume=372|issue=2013|doi=10.1098/rsta.2014.0059|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/372/2031/20140059.short|accessdate=8 June 2015|display-authors=etal|pages=20140059|bibcode=2014RSPTA.37240059D}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a first test is scheduled for 2019, taking place in the Tucson desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Scientists Taking Geoengineering Into the Field|publisher=ClimateCentral|year=2017|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/news/harvard-scientists-taking-geoengineering-into-the-field-21362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
Most of the existing governance of stratospheric sulfate aerosols is from that which is applicable to solar radiation management more broadly. However, some existing legal instruments would be relevant to stratospheric sulfate aerosols specifically. At the international level, the [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]] (CLRTAP Convention) obligates those countries which have ratified it to reduce their emissions of particular transboundary air pollutants. Notably, both solar radiation management and climate change (as well as greenhouse gases) could satisfy the definition of "air pollution" which the signatories commit to reduce, depending on their actual negative effects.&lt;ref&gt;Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution art. 1, Nov. 13, 1979, 1302 U.N.T.S. 219, Article 1&lt;/ref&gt; Commitments to  specific values of the pollutants, including sulfates, are made through protocols to the CLRTAP Convention. Full implementation or large scale climate response field tests of stratospheric sulfate aerosols could cause countries to exceed their limits. However, because stratospheric injections would be spread across the globe instead of concentrated in a few nearby countries, and could lead to net reductions in the "air pollution" which the CLRTAP Convention is to reduce, it is uncertain how the convention's Implementation Committee and Executive Body would respond to such event.

The stratospheric injection of sulfate aerosols would cause the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] to be applicable, due to their possible deleterious effects on stratospheric ozone. That treaty generally obligates its Parties to enact policies to control activities which "have or are likely to have adverse effects resulting from modification or likely modification of the ozone layer."&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, opened for
signature Mar. 22, 1985, 1513 U.N.T.S. 293, Article  1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Montreal Protocol]] to the Vienna Convention prohibits the production of certain ozone depleting substances, via phase outs. Sulfates are presently not among the prohibited substances.

In the United States, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] might give the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] authority to regulate stratospheric sulfate aerosols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hester|first1=Tracy D.|title=Remaking the World to Save it: Applying U.S. Environmental Laws to Climate Engineering Projects|journal=Ecology Law Quarterly|date=2011|volume=38|issue=4|pages=876–880|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/elq/vol38/iss4/2/|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Value engineering''' ('''VE''') is a systematic method to improve the "value" of goods or products and services by using an examination of function. Value, as defined, is the ratio of function to [[cost]]. Value can therefore be manipulated by either improving the function or reducing the [[cost]]. It is a primary tenet of value engineering that basic functions be preserved and not be reduced as a consequence of pursuing value improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.value-eng.org/pdf_docs/monographs/vmstd.pdf |title=Value Methodology Standard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319204415/http://www.value-eng.org/pdf_docs/monographs/vmstd.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasoning behind value engineering is as follows: if marketers expect a product to become practically or stylistically obsolete within a specific length of time, they can design it to only last for that specific lifetime. The products could be built with higher-grade components, but with value engineering they are not because this would impose an unnecessary cost on the manufacturer, and to a limited extent also an increased cost on the purchaser. Value engineering will reduce these costs. A company will typically use the least expensive components that satisfy the product's lifetime projections. 

Due to the very short life spans, however, which is often a result of this "value engineering technique", [[planned obsolescence]] has become associated with product deterioration and inferior quality. [[Vance Packard]] once claimed this practice gave engineering as a whole a bad name, as it directed creative engineering energies toward short-term market ends. Philosophers such as [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Jacque Fresco]] have also criticized the economic and societal implications of this model.
Value engineering is the structural and analytical process that seeks to achieve the value for money.For instance, [[Mousakhani]] and his friends state that the usage of VE (Value Engineering) in the project management of road construction definitely enhances the value of these types of projects&lt;ref&gt;https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/JEDT-12-2015-0083?fullSc=1&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
Value engineering began at [[General Electric Co.]] during [[World War II]]. Because of the war, there were shortages of skilled labour, raw materials, and component parts. [[Lawrence D. Miles|Lawrence Miles]], Jerry Leftow, and Harry Erlicher at G.E. looked for acceptable substitutes. They noticed that these substitutions often reduced costs, improved the product, or both. What started out as an accident of necessity was turned into a systematic process. They called their technique "value analysis".

==Description==
Value engineering is sometimes taught within the [[project management]] or [[industrial engineering]] body of knowledge as a technique in which the value of a system’s outputs is [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimized]] by crafting a mix of performance (function) and costs. In most cases this practice identifies and removes unnecessary expenditures, thereby increasing the value for the manufacturer and/or their customers.

VE follows a structured thought process that is based exclusively on "function", i.e. what something "does" not what it is. For example a screw driver that is being used to stir a can of paint has a "function" of mixing the contents of a paint can and not the original connotation of securing a screw into a screw-hole. In value engineering "functions" are always described in a two word abridgment consisting of an active verb and measurable noun (what is being done – the verb – and what it is being done to – the noun) and to do so in the most non-prescriptive way possible. In the screw driver and can of paint example, the most basic function would be "blend liquid" which is less prescriptive than "stir paint" which can be seen to limit the action (by stirring) and to limit the application (only considers paint). This is the basis of what value engineering refers to as "function analysis".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title= The Value Methodology Standard |date=August 2007|publisher= SAVE International| url = http://www.value-eng.org/catalog_monographs.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Value engineering uses rational logic (a unique "how" - "why" questioning technique) and the analysis of function to identify relationships that increase value.  It is considered a quantitative method similar to the scientific method, which focuses on hypothesis-conclusion approaches to test relationships, and operations research, which uses model building to identify predictive relationships.

==Legal terminology==
In the United States, value engineering is specifically mandated for federal agencies by section 4306 of the [[Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996#National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996|National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ106/pdf/PLAW-104publ106.pdf National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996], Public Law 104-106, accessed 4 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; which amended the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 401 et seq.):
:“Each [[executive agency]] shall establish and maintain cost-effective value engineering procedures and processes".
:"As used in this section, the term ‘value engineering’ means an analysis of the functions of a program, project, system, product, item of equipment, building, facility, service, or supply of an executive agency, performed by qualified agency or contractor personnel, directed at improving performance, reliability, quality, safety, and life cycle costs".

The '''Wyss&lt;ref&gt;Pronounced {{IPAc-en|v|iː|s}} "veese".&lt;/ref&gt; Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering''' is a cross-disciplinary [[research institute]] at [[Harvard University]] which focuses on developing new [[Biologically inspired engineering|bioinspired]] materials and devices for applications in healthcare, manufacturing, robotics, energy, and sustainable architecture. The Institute has two sites: one in the Center for Life Sciences Boston building in Boston’s [[Longwood Medical Area]], and one on Harvard's main campus in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].  The Wyss Institute was launched in January 2009 with a $125 million gift to Harvard—at the time, the largest single philanthropic gift in its history—from [[Hansjörg Wyss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The Institute works as an alliance among [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Harvard School of Dental Medicine]], [[Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences]], [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]], [[Children’s Hospital Boston]], [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]], [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], [[Boston University]], [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital]], [[Tufts University]], [[Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin]], [[University of Zurich]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]]. Translating technological discoveries into commercial products and therapies is an important part of the organization's mission.

==Organization==

The Wyss Institute’s scientific operations are organized around six Enabling Technology Platforms that focus on development of new core technologies and capabilities that will facilitate the explosion of major R&amp;D areas in the field of bioinspired engineering.  The platforms integrate multiple faculty members with the advanced technology team, clinical experts, and industrial partners. The Institute platforms are:

* Adaptive material technologies: Integrated multiscale structures composed of [[biomimetic]] materials and devices that dynamically adapt to their environments for energy and environmental applications, such as construction materials that harness energy, heat, and water
* Anticipatory medical and cellular devices: Development of controllable and dynamic devices to anticipate and detect malfunctions and infections in the body, and [http://wyss.harvard.edu/viewpage/433 intervene to restore health], by taking advantage of the dynamic and changing nature of human physiology to engineer novel approaches for performance assessment, diagnosis, and therapeutic intervention
* Bioinspired robotics: Developing computer algorithms and sensor/actuator materials that enable [[robot]]s to act collectively in response to changes in their environment, such as swarms of [[RoboBee|flying insect robots]] to assist dwindling bee populations 
* Synthetic biology: Creating massively parallel capabilities for [[directed evolution]] of [[biomolecule]]s and whole [[genome]]s for applications in cell reprogramming, drug delivery, regenerative medicine, and bioenergy
* Biomimetic microsystems: Engineering microsystem technologies that reconstitute complex human organ-level functions for use in drug testing, diagnostic and therapeutic applications
* Programmable nanomaterials:  Creation of targetable, [[Molecular self-assembly|self-assembling]] [[Nanotechnology|nanotechnologies]] for [[regenerative medicine]] and [[drug delivery]] applications
