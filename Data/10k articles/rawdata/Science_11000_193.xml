'''A-002''' was the third abort test of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] spacecraft.

==Objectives==
Mission A-002 was the third in the series of abort tests to demonstrate that the launch system would perform satisfactorily under selected critical abort conditions. The main objective of this mission was to demonstrate the abort capability of the [[Launch escape system|launch escape vehicle]] in the maximum dynamic pressure region of the Saturn trajectory with conditions approximating the altitude limit at which the Saturn emergency detection system would signal an abort.

The launch vehicle was the third in the [[Little Joe II]] series. This vehicle differed from the previous two in that flight controls and instrumentation were incorporated, and the vehicle was powered by two Algol and four Recruit rocket motors. The launch escape system was also changed from previous configurations in that canards (forward control surfaces used to orient and stabilize the escape vehicle in the entry attitude) and a command module boost protective cover were incorporated. The Apollo spacecraft was simulated by a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] command and service module (BP-23). The Earth landing system was modified from the previous configuration by the installation of modified dual-drogue parachutes instead of a single-drogue parachute.

==Flight==

The A-002 vehicle was launched on December 8, 1964, at 08:00:00 a.m. M.S.T. (15:00:00 UTC) by igniting all launch vehicle motors simultaneously. Conditions at abort initiation were selected from Saturn boost trajectories, and a nominal test point was used for the maximum dynamic pressure region. A pitch up maneuver and the abort were initiated by using a real-time plot of the dynamic pressure versus Mach number. However, an improper constant was used in the meteorological data input to the real-time data system, resulting in the pitch up maneuver being initiated 2.4 seconds early. Although the planned test point was not achieved, the early pitch up caused a higher maximum dynamic pressure than the design value.

Canard deployment took place as expected 11.1 seconds after abort initiation. The launch escape vehicle tumbled four times before stabilizing with the aft heat shield forward. During the first turnaround, the soft portion of the boost protective cover was torn away from the command module. Maximum altitude attained by the launch escape vehicle was 50,360 feet (15,350 m) above mean sea level.

Baro-switches initiated the Earth landing sequence at an altitude of approximately 23,500 feet (7,163 m) above mean sea level. All parachutes deployed properly and the command module, supported by the three main parachutes, descended at the planned rate of about 24&amp;nbsp;ft/s (7&amp;nbsp;m/s)  to an Earth landing 32,800 feet (10&amp;nbsp;km) down range.

The abort conditions obtained were more than adequate in verifying the abort capability in the maximum dynamic pressure region. Only one test objective was not achieved: the boost protective cover was structurally inadequate for the environment experienced during the mission.

==Boilerplate location==
BP-23 was refurbished as BP-23A and used for Launch Pad Abort Test 2.  BP-23A is on display as part of the [[SA-500D]] Saturn V exhibit at the [[US Space &amp; Rocket Center]], Huntsville, Alabama.

The '''A1068''' is a road in northern [[England]] that runs from [[Seaton Burn]] in [[North Tyneside]] to [[Alnwick]] in [[Northumberland]].&lt;ref name=OS81&gt;{{cite map|title=Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 81 ''Alnwick &amp; Morpeth (Rothbury &amp; Amble)''|ISBN= 9780319242094 |publisher=Ordnance Survey|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section between [[Ellington, Northumberland|Ellington]] and [[Alnmouth]] is signposted as part of the ''Northumberland Coastal Route''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SABRE: A1068|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A1068|website=www.sabre-roads.org.uk|publisher=The Society for All British and Irish Road Enthusiasts|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Route==
The A1068 begins at a [[roundabout]] with the [[A19 road]] at Seaton Burn. It has a brief [[dual carriageway]] section before crossing from the county of Tyne and Wear into Northumberland. It is dual carriageway standard again past [[Nelson Village]], and [[concurrency (road)|joins the route of]] the [[A192 road]] for about {{convert|1|mi}}. It continues through the town of [[Bedlington]] where it meets the [[A193 road]] and beyond the town it has a junction with the [[A196 road]] (to [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]]). It joins the route of the [[A197 road (England)|A197 road]] for about {{convert|1|mi}} close to the town of [[Ashington]]. It re-emerges and heads in a north-easterly direction until it reaches the roundabout with the [[A189 road]]. From its junction with the A189 the A1068 gains [[primary status]] and heads roughly north. It passes the coastal town of [[Amble]] and the villages of [[Warkworth, Northumberland|Warkworth]] and [[Alnmouth]], crossing the [[River Aln]] at [[Lesbury]] before reaching the town of [[Alnwick]]. The road terminates at its junction with the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]].

The '''A512''' is an [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] entirely in [[Leicestershire]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]. It links the primary destination of [[Loughborough]] with the [[M1 motorway|M1]], [[A42 road (England)|A42 road]], and the town of [[Ashby de la Zouch]].

The road begins just outside Loughborough Town Centre, near to The Rushes {{nowrap|({{coord|52.7724|-1.2078|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A512 road (eastern end)}}).}} It heads out of town, crossing the A6004 Epinal Way and passing [[Loughborough University]]. On leaving the town, there is a short dual carriageway section, leading to the junction with Snells Nook Lane to Nanpanton and Woodhouse.

After this junction, the road returns to single carriageway for about {{convert|1|mi}}, to Junction 23 of the M1. 

At this junction, much of the traffic from Loughborough turns off, and it is a much quieter A512 that enters [[Shepshed]]. After Shepshed, the road passes through Northern [[Charnwood Forest]], near the villages of Peggs Green, [[Thringstone]], [[Griffydam]], [[Belton, Leicestershire|Belton]] and [[Osgathorpe]]. Shortly before Ashby it passes [[Coleorton Hall]] on the right &amp;ndash; a house which has played host to Scott, Wordsworth, Coleridge and others &amp;ndash; now converted to apartments.

The road ends at the junction with the A42 and [[A511 road|A511]] (formerly the [[A50 road|A50]]), on the edge of Ashby {{nowrap|({{coord|52.7491|-1.4456|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A512 road (western end)}}).}}

The A512 is {{convert|11|mi}} long, with the M1 junction {{convert|8|mi}} from the southern end.

The '''Aadhiya system''', also sometimes spelled as ''adhiya'', is a system, most prevalent in north-eastern, northern Bengali speaking parts of [[India]](As the word is Bengali), where a sex worker is rented a room or apartment by a ''mashi'' or [[brothel]] keeper, usually an older retired sex worker, who charges the worker rent for the room based on her total earnings rather than at a fixed rate, so that the mashi gets a share of the worker's earnings.&lt;ref&gt;''Guilty Without Trial", by Sleightholme &amp; Indrani (1996). {{ISBN|0-8135-2381-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kara2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Siddharth Kara|title=Sex Trafficking: Inside the Business of Modern Slavery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SH1sBUTysPMC&amp;pg=PA55|date=22 January 2009|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51139-1|pages=49, 54–56, 93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adoption ==
The development of web 2.0 has changed the research publication seeking and sharing within or outside the academy, but also provides new innovative constructs to measure the broad scientific impact of scholar work. Although the traditional metrics are useful, they might be insufficient to measure immediate and uncited impacts, especially outside the peer-review realm.&lt;ref name="Altmetrics-Manifesto-2011" /&gt;

In 2008, the [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]] started to systematically collect tweets about its articles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eysenbach|first1=G|title=Can tweets predict citations?

However, it is also observed that an article needs little attention to jump to the [[Quartile|upper quartile]] of ranked papers,&lt;ref name=Infiniflux-AltmetricRankings-2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Joel|title=Altmetric rankings|url=http://infiniflux.blogspot.ca/2013/08/altmetric-rankings.html|website=Infiniflux|date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that not enough sources of altmetrics are currently available to give a balanced picture of impact for the majority of papers.

Important in determining the relative impact of a paper, a service that calculates altmetrics statistics needs a considerably sized knowledge base. The following table shows the number of papers covered by services:

== Categories ==
Altmetrics are a very broad group of metrics, capturing various parts of impact a paper or work can have. A classification of altmetrics was proposed by ImpactStory in September 2012,&lt;ref name="NewFramework"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.impactstory.org/2012/09/14/31524247207/ |title=A new framework for altmetrics |publisher=ImpactStory Blog |date=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a very similar classification is used by the Public Library of Science:&lt;ref name="Lin2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lin | first1 = J. | last2 = Fenner | first2 = M. | doi = 10.3789/isqv25no2.2013.04 | title = Altmetrics in Evolution: Defining and Redefining the Ontology of Article-Level Metrics | journal = Information Standards Quarterly | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 20 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Viewed - HTML views and PDF downloads
* Discussed - journal comments, science blogs, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook and other social media
* Saved - [[Mendeley]], [[CiteULike]] and other social bookmarks
* Cited - citations in the scholarly literature, tracked by [[Web of Science]], [[Scopus]], [[CrossRef]] and others
* Recommended - for example used by F1000Prime&lt;ref&gt;[http://f1000.com/prime F1000Prime]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viewed ===
One of the first alternative metrics to be used was the number of views of a paper. Traditionally, an author would wish to publish in a journal with a high subscription rate, so many people would have access to the research. With the introduction of web technologies it became possible to actually count how often a single paper was looked at. Typically, publishers count the number of HTML views and PDF views. As early as 2004, the ''[[BMJ]]'' published the number of views for its articles, which was found to be somewhat correlated to citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7465.546 |title=Relation between online "hit counts" and subsequent citations: Prospective study of research papers in the BMJ |year=2004 |last1=Perneger |first1=T. V |journal=BMJ |volume=329 |issue=7465 |pages=546–7 |pmid=15345629 |pmc=516105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discussed ===
The discussion of a paper can be seen as a metric that captures the potential impact of a paper. Typical sources of data to calculate this metric include [[Facebook]], [[Google+]], [[Twitter]], Science Blogs, and Wikipedia pages. Some researchers regard the mentions on social media as citations. For example, citations on a social media platform could be divided into two categories: internal and external. For instance, the former includes retweets, the latter refers to tweets containing links to outside documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/45772|title=Citations in Web 2.0|last=Weller|first=Katrin|last2=Peters|first2=Isabella|date=2012|publisher=Düsseldorf Univ. Press|isbn=9783943460162|editor-last=Tokar|editor-first=Alexander|pages=209–222|language=en|editor-last2=Beurskens|editor-first2=Michael|editor-last3=Keuneke|editor-first3=Susanne|editor-last4=Mahrt|editor-first4=Merja|editor-last5=Peters|editor-first5=Isabella|editor-last6=Puschmann|editor-first6=Cornelius|editor-last7=Treeck|editor-first7=Timo van|editor-last8=Weller|editor-first8=Katrin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between the mentions and likes and citation by primary scientific literature has been studied, and a slight correlation at best was found, e.g. for articles in [[PubMed]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2008 the ''[[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]'' began publishing views and [[Twitter|tweets]]. These "tweetations" proved to be a good indicator of highly cited articles, leading the author to propose a "Twimpact factor", which is the number of Tweets it receives in the first seven days of publication, as well as a Twindex, which is the rank percentile of an article's Twimpact factor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, if implementing use of the Twimpact factor, research shows scores to be highly subject specific, and as a result, comparisons of Twimpact factors should be made between papers of the same subject area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is necessary to note that while past research in the literature has demonstrated a correlation between tweetations and citations, it is not a causative relationship. At this point in time, it is unclear whether higher citations occur as a result of greater media attention via twitter and other platforms, or is simply reflective of the quality of the article itself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Recent research conducted at the individual level, rather than the article level, supports the use of twitter and social media platforms as a mechanism for increasing impact value.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liang|first=Xuan|date=2014|title=Building Buzz: (Scientists) Communicating Science in New Media Environments|url=|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results indicate that researchers whose work is mentioned on twitter have significantly higher h-indices than those of researchers whose work was not mentioned on twitter. The study highlights the role of using discussion based platforms, such as twitter, in order to increase the value of traditional impact metrics.

Besides Twitter and other streams, blogging has shown to be a powerful platform to discuss literature. Various platforms exist that keep track of which papers are being blogged about. Altmetric.com uses this information for calculating metrics, while other tools just report where discussion is happening, such as ResearchBlogging and Chemical blogspace.

=== Recommended ===
Platforms may even provide a formal way of ranking papers or recommending papers otherwise, such as [[Faculty of 1000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Jennifer|last2=Fenner|first2=Martin|date=2013-04-01|title=The many faces of article-level metrics|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/bult.2013.1720390409|journal=Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=27–30|doi=10.1002/bult.2013.1720390409|issn=1550-8366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saved ===
It is also informative to quantify the number of times a page has been saved, or bookmarked. It is thought that individuals typically choose to bookmark pages that have a high relevance to their own work, and as a result, bookmarks may be an additional indicator of impact for a specific study. Providers of such information include science specific [[social bookmarking]] services such as [[CiteULike]] and [[Mendeley]].

=== Cited ===
The cited category is a narrowed definition, different from the discussion. Besides the traditional metrics based on citations in scientific literature, such as those obtained from [[Google Scholar]], [[CrossRef]], [[PubMed Central]], and [[Scopus]], altmetrics also adopt citations in secondary knowledge sources. For example, ImpactStory counts the number of times a paper has been referenced by  Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQ: which metrics are measured? |url=http://impactstory.org/faq#toc_3_7 |work=ImpactStory }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plum Analytics also provides metrics for various academic publications,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-69350-7_9|title=Medical Writing and Research Methodology for the Orthopaedic Surgeon|last=Papakostidis|first=Costas|last2=Giannoudis|first2=Peter V.|date=2018|publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=9783319693491|pages=71–79|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-69350-7_9}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeking to track research productivity. PLOS is also a tool that may be used to utilize information on engagement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Interpretation ==
While there is less consensus on the validity and consistency of altmetrics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jump |first=Paul |title=Research Intelligence - Alt-metrics: fairer, faster impact data? |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/420926.article |newspaper=Times Higher Education |date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the interpretation of altmetrics in particular is discussed. Proponents of altmetrics make clear that many of the metrics show attention or engagement, rather than the quality of impacts on the progress of science.&lt;ref name="Lin2013" /&gt; It should be noted that even citation-based metrics do not indicate if a high score implies a positive impact on science; that is, papers are also cited in papers that disagree with the cited paper, an issue for example addressed by the Citation Typing Ontology project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shotton | first1 = D. | title = CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology | doi = 10.1186/2041-1480-1-S1-S6 | journal = Journal of Biomedical Semantics | volume = 1 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S6–S1 | year = 2010 | pmid =  20626926| pmc =2903725 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altmetrics could be more appropriately interpreted by providing detailed context and qualitative data. For example, in order to evaluate the scientific contribution of a scholar work to policy making by altmetrics, qualitative data, such as who’s citing online&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Mehrazar |first=Maryam |last2=Kling |first2=Christoph Carl |last3=Lemke |first3=Steffen |last4=Mazarakis |first4=Athanasios |last5=Peters |first5=Isabella |date=2018-04-08 |title=Can We Count on Social Media Metrics? First Insights into the Active Scholarly Use of Social Media |book-title=Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Web Science |page=215 |arxiv=1804.02751 |doi=10.1145/3201064.3201101 |doi-access=free |isbn=9781450355636}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to what extent the online citation is relevant to the policymaking, should be provided as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.altmetric.com/blog/how-to-use-altmetrics-to-showcase-engagement-efforts-for-promotion-and-tenure/|title=How to Use Altmetrics to Showcase Engagement Efforts for Promotion and Tenure|date=2016-10-18|work=Altmetric|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the relatively low correlation between traditional metrics and altmetrics, altmetrics might measure complementary perspectives of the scholar impact. It is reasonable to combine and compare the two types of metrics in interpreting the societal and scientific impacts. Researchers built a 2*2 framework based on the interactions between altmetrics and traditional citations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Further explanations should be provided for the two groups with high altmetrics/low citations and low altmetrics/high citations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, altmetrics provide convenient approaches for researchers and institutions to monitor the impact of their work and avoid inappropriate interpretations.

== Controversy ==
The usefulness of metrics for estimating scientific impact is controversial.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news |title=Are Alternative Metrics Still Alternative? |author1=Mike Buschman |author2=Andrea Michalek |url=http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Apr-13/AprMay13_Buschman_Michalek.html  |newspaper=asis&amp;t Bulletin |date=April–May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cheung | first1 = M. K. | title = Altmetrics: Too soon for use in assessment | doi = 10.1038/494176d | journal = Nature | volume = 494 | issue = 7436 | pages = 176 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23407528| pmc = | bibcode = 2013Natur.494..176C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has found that online buzz could amplify the effect of other forms of outreach on researchers’ scientific impact. For the nano-scientists that are mentioned on Twitter, their interactions with reporters and non-scientists positively and significantly predicted higher h-index, whereas the non-mentioned group failed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Altmetrics expands the measurement of scholar impact for containing a rapid uptake, a broader range of audiences and diverse research outputs. In addition, the community shows a clear need: funders demand measurables on the impact of their spending, such as public engagement.

However, there are limitations that affect the usefulness due to technique problems and systematic bias of construct, such as data quality, heterogeneity and particular dependencies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In terms of technique problems, the data might be incomplete, because it is difficult to collect those online research outputs without direct links to their mentions (i.e. videos) and identify different versions of one research work. Additionally, whether the API leads to any missing data is unsolved.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As for systematic bias, like other metrics, altmetrics are prone to self-citation, gaming, and other mechanisms to boost one's apparent impact. Altmetrics can be [[Gaming the system|gamed]]: for example, likes and mentions can be bought.&lt;ref name="Beall2013"&gt;J. Beall, Article-Level Metrics: An Ill-Conceived and Meretricious Idea, 2013, {{cite web|url=http://scholarlyoa.com/2013/08/01/article-level-metrics/|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806010915/http://scholarlyoa.com/2013/08/01/article-level-metrics/|archivedate=2013-08-06|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altmetrics can be more difficult to standardize than citations. One example is the number of tweets linking to a paper where the number can vary widely depending on how the tweets are collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chamberlain|first1=S.|year=2013|title=Consuming Article-Level Metrics: Observations and Lessons|journal=Information Standards Quarterly|volume=25|issue=2|pages=4–13|doi=10.3789/isqv25no2.2013.02|pmc=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, online popularity may not equal to scientific values. Some popular online citations might be far from the value of generating further research discoveries, while some theoretical-driven or minority-targeted research of great science-related importance might be marginalized online.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, the top tweeted articles in biomedicine in 2011 were relevant to curious or funny content, potential health applications, and catastrophe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Altmetrics for more recent articles may be higher because of the increasing uptake of the social web and because articles may be mentioned mainly when they are published.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Thelwall|first1=M.|last2=Haustein|first2=S.|last3=Larivière|first3=V.|last4=Sugimoto|first4=C. R.|year=2013|title=Do Altmetrics Work? Twitter and Ten Other Social Web Services|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=5|pages=e64841|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0064841|pmc=3665624|pmid=23724101|bibcode=2013PLoSO...864841T}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it might not be fair to compare the altmetrics scores of articles unless they have been published at a similar time. Researchers has developed a sign test to avoid the usage uptake bias by comparing the metrics of an article with the two articles published immediately before and after it.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

It should be kept in mind that the metrics are only one of the outcomes of tracking how research is disseminated and used. Altmetrics should be carefully interpreted to overcome the bias. Even more informative than knowing how often a paper is cited, is which papers are citing it. That information allows researchers to see how their work is impacting the field (or not). Providers of metrics also typically provide access to the information from which the metrics were calculated. For example, [[Web of Science]] shows which are the citing papers, ImpactStory shows which Wikipedia pages are referencing the paper, and CitedIn shows which databases extracted data from the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Waagmeester|first1=A.|last2=Evelo|first2=C.|year=2011|title=Measuring impact in online resources with the CInumber (the CitedIn Number for online impact)|journal=Nature Precedings|doi=10.1038/npre.2011.6037.1|pmc=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern of altmetrics, or any metrics, is how universities or institutions are using metrics to rank their employees make promotion or funding decisions,&lt;ref&gt;David Colquhoun, [http://www.dcscience.net/?p=182 How should universities be run to get the best out of people?], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the aim should be limited to measure engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/altmetrics-risk-becoming-part-problem-not-solution-warns-academic|title=Altmetrics risk becoming part of problem, not solution, warns academic|last1=Matthews|first1=David|date=7 October 2015|website=Times Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall online research output is very little and varied among different disciplines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The phenomenon might be consistent with the social media use among scientists. Surveys has shown that nearly half of their respondents held ambivalent attitudes of social media’s influence on academic impact and never announced their research work on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scimep.wisc.edu/projects/reports/|title=Reports|date=2014-09-11|work=Science, Media and the Public|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the changing shift in open science and social media use, the consistent altmetrics across disciplines and institutions will more likely be adopted.

== Ongoing research ==
The specific use cases and characteristics is an active research field in [[bibliometrics]], providing much needed data to measure the impact of altmetrics itself.

There is other research examining the validity of one altmetrics&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or make comparisons across different platforms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Researchers examine the correlation between altmetrics and traditional citations as the validity test.

However, it remains unsolved that what altmetrics are most valuable and what degree of correlation between two metrics generates a stronger impact on the measurement. Additionally, the validity test itself faces some technical problems as well. For example, replication of the data collection is impossible because of the instant changing algorithms of data providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Jean|last2=Adie|first2=Euan|date=2013-04-01|title=Five challenges in altmetrics: A toolmaker's perspective|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/bult.2013.1720390410|journal=Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=31–34|doi=10.1002/bult.2013.1720390410|issn=1550-8366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{otheruses|Animal science (disambiguation)}}
{{broader|Agricultural science}}
'''Animal Science''' (also '''Animal [[Bioscience]]''') is described as "studying the [[biology]] of [[animal]]s that are under the control of humankind." It can also be described as the production and management of farm animals.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 | url = http://www.reading.ac.uk/Study/Departments/ug-AnimalScience.asp
 | title = Animal Science
 | work = University of Reading
 | accessdate = 2009-04-15}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the degree was called [[animal husbandry]] and the animals studied were [[livestock]] species, like [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[pig]]s,  [[poultry]], and [[horse]]s. Today, courses available now look at a far broader area to include companion animals like [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s, and many exotic species. Degrees in Animal Science are offered at a number of colleges and universities. Typically, the Animal Science curriculum not only provides a strong science background, but also hands-on experience working with animals on campus-based farms. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Education ==
Professional education in animal science prepares students for career opportunities in areas such as animal breeding, food and fiber production, nutrition, animal [[agribusiness]], animal behavior and welfare. Courses in a typical Animal Science program may include genetics, microbiology, animal behavior, nutrition, physiology, and reproduction. Courses in support areas, such as genetics, soils, agricultural economics and marketing, legal aspects, and the environment also are offered. All of these courses are essential to entering an animal science profession.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Bachelor degree ===
At many universities, a [[Bachelor of Science]] (BS) degree in Animal Science allows emphasis in certain areas. Typical areas are species-specific or career-specific. Species-specific areas of emphasis prepare students for a career in [[dairy]] management, [[beef]] management, [[swine]] management, [[sheep]] or small ruminant management, [[poultry]] production, or the [[horse]] industry. Other career-specific areas of study include pre-veterinary medicine studies, livestock business and marketing, animal welfare and behavior, animal nutrition science, animal reproduction science, or genetics. Youth programs are also an important part of animal science programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animalscience.unl.edu/aboutansc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612044227/http://animalscience.unl.edu/aboutansc |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-06-12 |title=About Animal Science |publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln |accessdate=2015-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pre-veterinary emphasis ====
Many schools that offer a degree option in Animal Science also offer a pre-veterinary emphasis such as [[ Iowa State University]], the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] and the [[University of Minnesota]], for example.  This option provides an in-depth knowledge base of the biological and physical sciences including nutrition, reproduction, physiology, and genetics. This can prepare students for graduate studies in animal science, veterinary school, and pharmaceutical or animal science industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ansci.umn.edu/education/undergrad_program.htm |title=Department of Animal Science |publisher=University of Minnesota |accessdate=2011-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007022659/http://www.ansci.umn.edu/education/undergrad_program.htm |archivedate=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Graduate studies ===
In a [[Master of Science]] degree option, students take required courses in areas that support their main interest. These courses are above courses normally required for a Bachelor of Science degree in the Animal Science major. For example, in a Ph.D. degree program students take courses related to their major that are more in-depth than those for the Master of Science degree, with an emphasis on research or teaching.

Graduate studies in animal sciences are considered preparation for upper-level positions in production, management, education, research, or agriservices. Professional study in veterinary medicine, law, and business administration are among the most commonly chosen programs by graduates. Other areas of study include growth biology, physiology, nutrition, and production systems.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

'''Apollo Glacier''' ({{Coord|68|50|S|64|45|W|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]], {{convert|9|nmi|km}} long, flowing northeast and joining the lower part of [[Aphrodite Glacier]] {{convert|2|nmi|km|0}} from the east coast of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The lower part of this glacier was first plotted by [[W.L.G. Joerg]], from aerial photographs taken by [[Sir Hubert Wilkins]] in December 1928 and by [[Lincoln Ellsworth]] in November 1935. The glacier was subsequently photographed by the [[Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition]] in December 1947 ([[trimetrogon]] air photography) and roughly surveyed by the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]] in November 1960. It was named by the [[UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee]] after [[Apollo]], the god of manly youth and beauty in Greek mythology.&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt;

At the time the Centre was conceived, access to equipment and expertise was unavailable for many amateur astronomers in the UK and a national centre would have provided an invaluable focal point&lt;ref name="Google Books - New Scientist" /&gt; Developments in optical fabrication, photography and communications now permit many visitors and members to complement their home astronomical facilities, skills and experience with those of the Astronomy Centre.

In keeping with the Centres original ethos, besides welcoming visitors to the facility, current members engage off-site with schools, youth organisations and community groups and also provide contributions to national, regional, local print and broadcast media.

==Structures==

The first permanent housing on the site was built to shelter a {{convert|17|inch|mm}} [[aperture]] [[Newtonian telescope]]. Further construction took the total number of separate telescope mountings to 14 by the end of 2015.&lt;ref name="Astronomy Centre structures image"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.astronomycentre.org.uk/images/DSC00427.jpg |title= View to southeast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main observatory tower is a three level {{convert|29|ft|m}} round building topped by an [[aluminium]] dome with twin {{convert|3|ft|m}} sliding doors.&lt;ref name="Main building"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.astronomycentre.org.uk/index.php/2-uncategorised/8-membership |title= Main Observatory Layout}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its construction by the members was completed in April 2000.

The largest optical telescope currently in regular use is a {{convert|30|inch|mm}} open truss Newtonian on a mount inspired by the designs of [[John Dobson (amateur astronomer)|John Dobson]].&lt;ref name="30inch"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.astronomycentre.org.uk/index.php/2-uncategorised/17-30-reflecting-telescope |title= Instrument Special Feature}}&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|42.6|inch|mm}} mirror blank is available for a future enhancement of the facilities but construction of the UK's largest reflector since the destruction of the {{convert|98|inch|mm}} original [[Isaac Newton Telescope]] at [[Herstmonceux Castle]] is currently on hold. &lt;ref name="Lancashire Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/12897258.AstronomersfearringofturbinesacrossSouthPennineMoors/ |title= Astronomers fear ‘ring of turbines’ across South Pennine Moors}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to the permanently mounted 30", 20", 17", 16", 12" and 8" instruments there are fixed locations to allow a number of smaller portable items to be quickly set up if visitor numbers increase on a clear night.

Many of the optical instruments were constructed by telescope maker Peter Drew, who has also provided many other societies and individuals (such as [[Hoober Observatory]]) with their equipment. This includes a number of [[Camera obscura|cameras obscura]]&lt;ref name="JBAA"&gt;{{Cite journal|bibcode= 2000JBAA..110...25F |title= Astronomy and the camera obscura|journal= Journal of the British Astronomical Association|volume= 110|pages= 25|author1= Feist|first1= M.|year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to, but smaller than, the one installed on the main Observatory building.

'''Boeddicker''' is a crater in the [[Aeolis quadrangle]] of [[Mars]], located at 15° south latitude and 197.7° west longitude.  It is 109&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and was named after [[Otto Boeddicker]], a German astronomer (1853–1937).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature {{!}} Boeddicker|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/791|website=usgs.gov|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/mars/&lt;/ref&gt;

Boeddicker Crater was discussed as a landing site for the 2003 Mars Exploration Rovers.  It was one of 25 from a list of 185 after the FirstLanding Site Workshop for the 2003 Mars Exploration Rovers, January 24–25, 2001, at NASA Ames Research Center.&lt;ref&gt;Golombek M. et al.

In [[German language|German]] linguistics, the '''Boppard Line''' is an [[isogloss]] separating the dialects to the north, which have a /v/ in words  such as ''Korv'' (or ''Korf''), "basket", and ''leven'', "to live", from the dialects to the south (including standard German), which have a /b/: ''Korb'', ''leben''.  The line runs from east to west and crosses the river [[Rhine]] at the town of [[Boppard]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1073">The '''CLEAN''' algorithm is a computational algorithm to perform a [[deconvolution]] on images created in [[radio astronomy]]. It was published by {{ill|Jan Högbom|sv}} in 1974&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/1974A%26AS...15..417H Aperture Synthesis with a Non-Regular Distribution of Interferometer Baselines], original publication by Jan Högbom about CLEAN, in the Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement, Vol. 15, p.417&lt;/ref&gt; and several variations have been proposed since then.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/doc/html/map-html/node37.html The family of CLEAN algorithms], a chapter from the ''MAPPING'' software manual&lt;/ref&gt;

The algorithm assumes that the image consists of a number of point sources. It will iteratively find the highest value in the image and subtract a small gain of this point source convolved with the [[point spread function]] ("dirty beam") of the observation, until the highest value is smaller than some threshold.

{{Community}}
A '''community of interest''', or interest-based community, is a [[community]] of people who share a common interest or passion. These people exchange ideas and thoughts about the given passion, but may know (or care) little about each other outside this area. Participation in a community of interest can be compelling, entertaining and create a community where people return frequently and remain for extended periods. Frequently, they cannot be easily defined by a particular geographical area.

In other words, "a community of interest is a gathering of people assembled around a topic of common interest. Its members take part in the community to exchange information, to obtain answers to personal questions or problems, to improve their understanding of a subject, to share common passions or to play."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=F.

'''Development geography''' is a branch of [[geography]] which refers to the [[standard of living]] and its [[quality of life]] of its human inhabitants. In this context, development is a process of change that affects people's lives. It may involve an improvement in the quality of life as perceived by the people undergoing change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hi.com.au/geogglobal1/pdf/global1_2_3.pdf Geography of global interactions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528032624/http://www.hi.com.au/geogglobal1/pdf/global1_2_3.pdf |date=2008-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, development is not always a positive process. [[Gunder Frank]] commented on the global economic forces that lead to the development of underdevelopment. This is covered in his [[dependency theory]].

In development geography, geographers study spatial patterns in development. They try to find by what characteristics they can measure development by looking at [[economic]], [[political]] and [[social]] factors. They seek to understand both the geographical ''causes'' and ''consequences'' of varying development. Studies compare [[MEDCs|More Economically Developed Countries (MEDCs)]] with [[LEDC|Less Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs)]]. Additionally variations within countries are looked at such as the differences between [[Italy|northern]] and southern Italy, the [[Southern Italy|Mezzogiorno]].

==Quantitative indicators==
Quantitative indicators are numerical indications of development.
*Economic include [[GNP]] (Gross National Product) per capita, [[unemployment]] rates, [[World energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]] and percentage of GNP in primary industries. Of these, GNP per capita is the most used as it measures the value of all the goods and services produced in a country, excluding those produced by foreign companies, hence measuring the economic and industrial development of the country. However, using GNP per capita also has many problems. 
**It does not take into account the distribution of the money which can often be extremely unequal as in the [[UAE]] where oil money has been collected by a rich elite and has not flowed to the bulk of the country. 
**GNP does not measure whether the money produced is actually improving people's lives and this is important because in many MEDCs there are large increases in wealth over time but only small increases in happiness. 
**The figure rarely takes into account the unofficial economy, which includes subsistence agriculture and cash-in-hand or unpaid work, which is often substantial in LEDCs. In LEDCs it is often too expensive to accurately collect this data and some governments intentionally or unintentionally release inaccurate figures{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. 
** The figure is usually given in US dollars which due to changing currency exchange rates can distort the money's true street value so it is often converted using [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) in which the actual comparative purchasing power of the money in the country is calculated.
* Social indications include access to clean water and [[sanitation]] (which indicate the level of infrastructure developed in the country) and adult [[literacy]] rate, measuring the resources the government has to meet the needs of the people.
*Demographic indicators include the [[birth rate]], [[death rate]] and [[fertility rate]], which indicate the level of [[industrialization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/population/devindicatorsrev2.shtml BBC bitesize]&lt;/ref&gt;
**Health indicators (a sub-factor of demographic indicators) include [[nutrition]] (calories per day, calories from protein, percentage of population with malnutrition), [[infant mortality]] and population per doctor, which indicate the availability of [[healthcare]] and [[sanitation]] facilities in a country.
*Environmental indications include how much a country does for the environment.

===Composite indicators===
*In the table below [[GDP]] stands for gross domestic product, which is generally taken to be equal to GNP.
*Other composite measures include the [[PQLI]] (Physical Quality of Life Index) which was a precursor to the HDI which used infant mortality rate instead of GNP per capita and rated countries from 0 to 100. It was calculated by assigning each country a score of 0 to 100 for each indicator compared with other countries in the world. The average of these three numbers makes the PQLI of a country.
*The [[Human Poverty Index|HPI]] (Human Poverty Index) is used to calculate the percentage of people in a country who live in relative poverty. In order to better differentiate the number of people in abnormally poor living conditions the HPI-1 is used in developing countries, and the HPI-2 is used in developed countries. The HPI-1 is calculated based on the percentage of people not expected to survive to 40, the adult illiteracy rate, the percentage of people without access to safe water, health services and the percentage of children under 5 who are underweight. The HPI-2 is calculated based on the percentage of people who do not survive to 60, the adult [[functional illiteracy]] rate and the percentage of people living below 50% of median personal disposable income.
*The [[Gender-related Development Index|GDI]] (Gender-related Development Index) measures gender equality in a country in terms of life expectancy, literacy rates, school attendance and income.

==Qualitative indicators==
Qualitative indicators include descriptions of living conditions and people's quality of life. They are useful in analyzing features that are not easily calculated or measured in numbers such as freedom, corruption, or security, which are largely non-material benefits.

==Geographic variations in development==
[[Image:North South divide.svg|The updated view of the [[north-south divide]]. Blue includes G8 nations, developed / first world nations, and Europe|right|thumb|350px]]
There is a considerable spatial variation in development rates.

{{quote|Global wealth also increased in material terms, and during the period 1947 to 2000, average per capita incomes tripled as global GDP increased almost tenfold (from $US3 trillion to $US30 trillion)... Over 25% of the 4.5 billion people in LEDCs still have life expectancies below 40 years. More than 80 countries have a lower annual per capita income in 2000 than they did in 1990. The average income in the world's five richest countries is 74 times the level in the world's poorest five, the widest it has ever been. Nearly 1.3 billion people have no access to clean water. About 840 million people are malnourished.|Stephen Codrington&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetgeography.com Codrington, Stephen ''Planet Geography 3rd Edition'' (2005) Page 97]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The most famous pattern in development is the [[North-South divide]]. The North-South divide separates the rich North or the developed world, from the poor South. This line of division is not as straightforward as it sounds and splits the globe into two main parts. It is also known as the Brandt Line.

The "North" in this divide is regarded as being North America, Europe, Russia, South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the like. The countries within this area are generally the more economically developed. The "South" therefore encompasses the remainder of the Southern Hemisphere, mostly consisting of KFCs. Another possible dividing line is the Tropic of Cancer with the exceptions of Australia and New Zealand. It is critical to understand that the status of countries is far from static and the pattern is likely to become distorted with the fast development of certain southern countries, many of them [[Newly industrialized countries|NICs]] (Newly Industrialised Countries) including India, Thailand, Brazil, Malaysia, Mexico and others. These countries are experiencing sustained fast development on the back of growing manufacturing industries and exports.

Most countries are experiencing significant increases in wealth and standard of living. However, there are unfortunate exceptions to this rule. Noticeably some of the former [[Soviet Union]] countries has experienced major disruption of industry in the transition to a market economy. Many African nations have recently experienced reduced GNPs due to wars and the AIDS epidemic, including Angola, Congo, Sierra Leone and others. Arab oil producers rely very heavily on oil exports to support their GDPs so any reduction in oil's market price can lead to rapid decreases in GNP. Countries which rely on only a few exports for much of their income are very vulnerable to changes in the market value of those commodities and are often derogatively called [[banana republics]]. Many developing countries do rely on exports of a few primary goods for a large amount of their income (coffee and timber for example), and this can create havoc when the value of these commodities drops, leaving these countries with no way to pay off their debts.

Within countries the pattern is that wealth is more concentrated around urban areas than rural areas. Wealth also tends towards areas with natural resources or in areas that are involved in tertiary (service) industries and trade. This leads to a gathering of wealth around mines and monetary centres such as New York, London and Tokyo.

==Barriers to international development==

Geographers along with other social scientists have recognized that certain factors present in a given society may impede the social and economic development of that society. Factors, which have been identified as obstructing the economic and social welfare of developing societies, include:

*Lack of education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gyimah-Brempong | first1 = K | year = 2011 | title = Education and Economic Development in Africa | url = | journal = [[African Development Review]] | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 219–236 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8268.2011.00282.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Lack of healthcare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/17537980810861475 |title=Spearheading human and economic development in the Arab world through evidence‐based and world‐class healthcare |journal=Education, Business and Society: Contemporary Middle Eastern Issues |volume=1 |pages=12 |year=2008 |last1=Bowman |first1=Brett |last2=Matzopoulos |first2=Richard |last3=Lerer |first3=Leonard }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Pervasiveness of intoxicating drugs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = Merrill | year = 2008 | title = Drugs and development: The global impact of drug use and trafficking on social and economic development | url = | journal = International Journal of Drug Policy | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 467–478 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugpo.2006.12.007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Weak political, social, and economic institutions&lt;ref&gt;Hernando de Soto, ''Dead Capital and the Poor'', The Johns Hopkins University Press. 2001{{pn|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Ineffective taxation
*Environmental degradation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mosznski | first1 = Peter | year = 2011 | title = Environmental degradation risks undermining development progress, warns report | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 343 | issue = | pages = d7043| doi = 10.1136/bmj.d7043 | pmid = 22049525 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Lack of religious/gender/racial/sexual freedoms
*Indebtedness
*Protectionist barriers to trade&lt;ref&gt;Merideth Kolsky Lewis "The EU's Protectionist Problem" Georgetown journal of International affairs. 01/01/2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Foreign aid&lt;ref&gt;Africa: the poorest continent is rising. Really. Dambisa Moyo. Foreign Policy. .172 (May–June 2009) p90&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Dependence upon primary resource exports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0014-2921(01)00125-8 |title=The curse of natural resources |journal=European Economic Review |volume=45 |issue=4–6 |pages=827 |year=2001 |last1=Sachs |first1=Jeffrey D. |last2=Warner |first2=Andrew M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Unequal distribution of wealth
*Inhospitable climate

Effective governments may address many barriers to economic and social development, however in many instances this is challenging due to the path dependency societies develop regarding many of these issues.  Some barriers to development may be impossible to address, such as climatic barriers to development.  In these cases societies must evaluate whether such climatic barriers to development dictate that society must relocate a given settlement in order to enjoy greater economic development.

Many scholars agree that foreign aid provided to developing nations is ineffective and in many instances counter productive.&lt;ref&gt;Africa: the poorest continent is rising. Really.Dambisa Moyo. Foreign Policy. .172 (May–June 2009) p90.&lt;/ref&gt;   This is due to the manner in which foreign aid changes the incentives for productivity in a given developing society, and the manner in which foreign aid has the tendency to corrupt the governments responsible for its allocation and distribution.

Cultural barriers to development such as discrimination based on gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation are challenging to address in certain oppressive societies, though recent progress has been significant in some societies.

While the aforementioned barriers to economic growth and development are most prevalent in the less developed economies of the world, even the most developed economies are plagued by select barriers to development such as drug prohibition and income inequality.

== Aid ==
[[MEDC]]s (More Economically Developed Countries) can give aid to [[LEDC]]s (Less Economically Developed Countries). There are several types of aid:
* Governmental (bilateral) aid
* International Organizational (multilateral) aid, e.g. The World Bank
* Voluntary aid from individuals, often mediated through NGOs
* Short-term/emergency aid (humanitarian assistance)
* Long-term/sustainable aid
* Non-governmental organization (NGO) aid

Aid can be given in several ways. Through money, materials, or skilled and learned people (e.g. teachers).

Aid has advantages. Mostly short-term or emergency aid help people in LEDCs to survive a natural (earthquake, tsunami, volcano eruption etc.) or human (civil war etc.) disaster. Aid helps make the recipient country (the country that receives aid) get more developed.

However, aid also has disadvantages. Often aid does not even reach the poorest people. Often money gained from aid is used up to make infrastructures (bridges, roads etc.), which only the rich can use. Also, the recipient country becomes more dependent on aid from a donor country (the country giving aid).

Whilst the above conception of aid has been the most pervasive within development geography work, it is important to remember that the aid landscape is far more complex than one directional flows from 'developed' to 'developing' countries. Development geographers have been at the forefront of research that aims to understand both the material exchanges and discourse surrounding 'South-South' development cooperation. 'Non-traditional' foreign aid from Southern, Middle Eastern and post-Socialist states (those outside the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD) provide alternative development discourses and approaches to that of the mainstream Western model. Development geographers seek to examine the geopolitical drivers behind the aid donor programmes of "LEDCs", as well as the discursive symbolic repertoires of non-DAC donor states.&lt;ref&gt;Mawdsley, E. (2012) 'The Changing Geographies of Foreign Aid and Development Cooperation: Contributions from Gift Theory' Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 37(2): 256-72&lt;/ref&gt; Two illustrative examples of the complex aid landscape are that of China, which has been active as an aid donor throughout the latter half of the twentieth century but published its first report on foreign aid policy as recently as 2011&lt;ref&gt;China publishes first report on foreign aid policy, ''[[The Guardian]]'' report: https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/apr/28/china-foreign-aid-policy-report&lt;/ref&gt; and India, an often cited aid recipient, but which has had donor programmes to Nepal and Bhutan since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;India's foreign aid programmes: https://m.devex.com/news/india-s-foreign-aid-program-catches-up-with-its/80919&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
A '''distal radius fracture''', also known as '''wrist fracture''', is a [[fracture (bone)|break]] of the part of the [[radius (bone)|radius bone]] which is close to the wrist.&lt;ref name=AO2013/&gt; Symptoms include pain, bruising, and rapid-onset swelling.&lt;ref name=AO2013/&gt; The wrist may be deformed.&lt;ref name=AO2013/&gt; The [[ulna bone]] may also be broken.&lt;ref name=AO2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
In younger people, these fractures typically occur during sports or a [[motor vehicle collision]].&lt;ref name=Mac2016/&gt; In older people, the most common cause is falling on an outstretched hand.&lt;ref name=Mac2016/&gt; Specific types include [[Colles' fracture|Colles]], [[Smith's fracture|Smith]], [[Barton's fracture|Barton]], and [[Chauffeur's fracture]]s.&lt;ref name=Mac2016/&gt; The diagnosis is generally suspected based on symptoms and confirmed with [[radiography|X-rays]].&lt;ref name=AO2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Treatment is with [[orthopedic cast|casting]] for six weeks or surgery.&lt;ref name=AO2013/&gt; Surgery is generally indicated if the joint surface is broken and does not line up, the radius is overly short, or the joint surface of the radius is tilted more than 10% backwards.&lt;ref name=Al2016/&gt; Among those who are casted, repeated X-rays are recommended within three weeks to verify that a good position is maintained.&lt;ref name=Al2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and prognosis --&gt;
Distal radius fractures are common.&lt;ref name=Al2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alluri|first1=RK|last2=Hill|first2=JR|last3=Ghiassi|first3=A|title=Distal Radius Fractures: Approaches, Indications, and Techniques.|journal=The Journal of hand surgery|date=August 2016|volume=41|issue=8|pages=845–54|doi=10.1016/j.jhsa.2016.05.015|pmid=27342171}}&lt;/ref&gt; They represent between 25% and 50% of all broken bones.&lt;ref name=Mac2016/&gt; They occur most commonly in young males and older females.&lt;ref name=Al2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mac2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacIntyre|first1=NJ|last2=Dewan|first2=N|title=Epidemiology of distal radius fractures and factors predicting risk and prognosis.|journal=Journal of hand therapy : official journal of the American Society of Hand Therapists|date=2016|volume=29|issue=2|pages=136–45|doi=10.1016/j.jht.2016.03.003|pmid=27264899}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year or two may be required for healing to occur.&lt;ref name=AO2013/&gt;
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Signs and symptoms==
People usually present with a history of falling on an outstretched hand and complaint of pain and swelling around the wrist, sometimes with deformity around the wrist.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; Any [[paresthesia|numbness]] should be asked to exclude [[median nerve|median]] and [[ulnar nerve]] injuries. Any pain in the limb of the same side should also be investigated to exclude associated injuries to the same limb.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

Swelling, deformity, tenderness, and loss of wrist motion are normal features on examination of a person with a distal radius fracture.  "Dinner fork" deformity of the wrist is caused by dorsal displacement of the [[carpal bones]] ([[Colle's fracture]]). Reverse deformity is seen in volar angulation ([[Smith's fracture]]). The wrist may be radially deviated due to shortening of the [[Radius (bone)|radius bone]].&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; Examination should also rule out a skin wound which might suggest an [[open fracture]], usually at the side.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; Tenderness at an area with no obvious deformity may still point to underlying fractures. Decreased sensation over the [[thenar eminence]] can be due to [[median nerve]] injury. Swelling and displacement can cause compression on the median nerve which results in acute [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] and requires prompt treatment.  Very rarely, pressure on the muscle components of the hand or forearm is sufficient to create a [[compartment syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

==Mechanism of injury==
[[File:TFCC tear.jpg|thumb|Arthroscopic image of a central triangular fibrocartilage complex tear]]
The most common cause of this type of fracture is a fall on an outstretched hand from standing height, although some fractures will be due to high-energy injury. People who fall on the outstretched hand are usually fitter and have better reflexes when compared to those with elbow or [[humerus]] fractures. The characteristics of distal radius fractures are influenced by the position of the hand at the time of impact, the type of surface at point of contact, the speed of the impact, and the strength of the bone. Distal radius fractures typically occur with the wrist bent back from 60 to 90 degrees.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; Radial styloid fracture would occur if the wrist is ulnar deviated and vice versa. If the wrist is bent back less, then proximal forearm fracture would occur, but if the bending back is more, then the carpal bones fracture would occur. With increased bending back, more force is required to produce a fracture. More force is required to produce a fracture in males than females. Risk of injury increases in those with [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

Common injuries associated with distal radius fractures are [[interosseous intercarpal ligaments]] injuries, especially scapholunate (4.7% to 46% of cases) and lunotriquetral ligaments (12% to 34% of cases) injuries. There is an increased risk of interosseous intercarpal injury if the ulnar variance (the difference in height between the distal end of the ulna and the distal end of the radius) is more than 2mm and there is fracture into the wrist joint.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; [[Triangular fibrocartilage]] complex (TFCC) injury occurs in 39% to 82% of cases. [[Ulnar styloid process]] fracture increases the risk of TFCC injury by a factor of 5:1. However, it is unclear whether intercarpal ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage injuries are associated with long term pain and disability for those who are affected.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Displaced distal radius fracture.jpg|thumb|X-ray of a displaced intra-articular distal radius fracture in an external fixator: The articular surface is widely displaced and irregular.]]
Diagnosis may be evident clinically when the distal radius is deformed, but should be confirmed by [[X-ray]].
The [[differential diagnosis]] includes [[scaphoid fracture]]s and wrist dislocations, which can also co-exist with a distal radius fracture. Occasionally, fractures may not be seen on X-rays immediately after the injury. Delayed X-rays, [[X-ray computed tomography]] (CT scan), or [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) can confirm the diagnosis.

===Medical imaging===
[[File:Dorsal tilt of distal radius fracture.jpg|thumb|Fracture with a dorsal tilt: Dorsal is left, and volar is right in the image.]]
X-ray of the affected wrist is required if a fracture is suspected. Posteroanterior, lateral, and oblique views can be used together to describe the fracture.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; X-ray of the uninjured wrist should also be taken to determine if any normal anatomic variations exist before surgery.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; 

A CT scan is often performed to further investigate the articular anatomy of the fracture, especially for fracture and displacement within the distal radio-ulnar joint.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

Various kinds of information can be obtained from X-rays of the wrist:&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

'''Lateral view'''
* '''Carpal malalignment''' - A line is drawn along the long axis of the [[capitate]] bone and another line is drawn along the long axis of the radius. If the carpal bones are aligned, both lines will intersect within the carpal bones. If the carpal bones are not aligned, both lines will intersect outside the carpal bones. Carpal malignment is frequently associated with dorsal or volar tilt of the radius and will have poor grip strength and poor forearm rotation.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;
* '''Tear drop angle''' - It is the angle between the line that pass through the central axis of the volar rim of the lunate facet of the radius and the line that pass through the long axis of the radius. Tear drop angle less than 45 degrees indicates displacement of lunate facet.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;
* '''Antero-posterior distance''' (AP distance) - Seen on lateral X-ray, it is the distance between the dorsal and volar rim of the lunate facet of the radius. The usual distance is 19 mm.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; Increased AP distance indicates the lunate facet fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Medoff|first1=RJ|title=Essential radiographic evaluation for distal radius fractures|journal=Hand Clinics|date=August 2005|volume=21|issue=3|pages=279-288|doi=10.1016/j.hcl.2005.02.008|pmid=16039439}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Volar or dorsal tilt''' - A line is drawn joining the most distal ends of the volar and dorsal side of the radius. Another line perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the radius is drawn. The angle between the two lines is the angle of volar or dorsal tilt of the wrist. Measurement of volar or dorsal tilt should be made in true lateral view of the wrist because [[pronation]] of the forearm reduces the volar tilt and supination increases it. When dorsal tilt is more than 11 degrees, it is associated with loss of grip strength and loss of wrist flexion.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

'''Posteroanterior view'''
* '''Radial inclination''' - It is the angle between a line drawn from the radial styloid to the medial end of the articular surface of the radius and a line drawn perpendicular to the long axis of the radius. Loss of radial inclination is associated with loss of grip strength.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;
* '''Radial length''' - It is the vertical distance in milimetres between a line tangential to the articular surface of the ulna and a tangential line drawn at the most distal point of radius ([[radial styloid]]). Shortening of radial length more than 4mm is associated with wrist pain.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;
* '''Ulnar variance''' - It is the vertical distance between a horizontal line parallel to the articular surface of the radius and another horizontal line drawn parallel to the articular surface of the ulnar head. Positive ulnar variance (ulna appears longer than radius) disturbs the integrity of triangular fibrocartilage complex and is associated with loss of grip strength and wrist pain.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

'''Oblique view'''
* Pronated oblique view of the distal radius helps to show the degree of comminution of the distal end radius, depression of the radial styloid, and confirming the position the screws at the radial side of the distal end radius. Meanwhile, a supinated oblique view of shows the ulnar side of the distal radius, accessing the depression of dorsal rim of the lunate facet, and the position of the screws on the ulnar side of the distal end radius.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

===Classification===
{{Main|Classification of distal radius fractures}}
There are many classification systems for distal radius fracture. AO/OTA classification is adopted by Orthopaedic Trauma Association and is the most commonly used classification system. There are three major groups: A—extra-articular, B—partial articular, and C—complete articular which can further subdivided into nine main groups and 27 subgroups depending on the degree of communication and direction of displacement. However, none of the classification systems demonstrate good liability. A qualification modifier (Q) is used for associated ulnar fracture.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

* If carpus is aligned, there are no limits for palmar tilt&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;
* If carpus is malaligned, wrist tilt should be neutral&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; 
* Gap or step deformity is less than 2mm&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

Treatment options for distal radius fractures include nonoperative management, external fixation, and internal fixation. Indications for each depend on a variety of factors such as the patient's age, initial fracture displacement, and metaphyseal and articular alignment, with the ultimate goal to maximize strength and function in the affected upper extremity.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/893628028|title=Rockwood and Green's fractures in adults|others=Court-Brown, Charles M.,, Heckman, James D.,, McQueen, Margaret M.,, Ricci, William M.,, Tornetta, Paul, III,, McKee, Michael D.,|isbn=9781451175318|edition=8th|location=Philadelphia|oclc=893628028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgeons use these factors combined with radiologic imaging to predict fracture instability, and functional outcome to help decide which approach would be most appropriate. Treatment is often directed to restore normal anatomy to avoid the possibility of malunion, which may cause decreased strength in the hand and wrist.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; The decision to pursue a specific type of management varies greatly by geography, physician specialty (hand surgeons vs. orthopedic surgeons), and advancements in new technology such as the volar locking plating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chung|first=Kevin C|last2=Shauver|first2=Melissa J|last3=Birkmeyer|first3=John D|title=Trends in the United States in the Treatment of Distal Radial Fractures in the Elderly|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00004623-200908000-00005|journal=The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

Distal radius fractures are often associated with distal radial ulnar joint (DRUJ) injuries, and the [[American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons]] recommends that postreduction lateral wrist X-rays should be obtained in all patients with distal radius fractures in order to preclude DRUJ injuries or dislocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orthoguidelines.org/guideline-detail?id=1042|title=OrthoGuidelines|website=www.orthoguidelines.org|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonoperative ===
The majority of distal radius fractures are treated with conservative nonoperative management, which involves immobilization through application of plaster or splint with or without closed reduction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/706805938|title=Essentials of musculoskeletal care|date=2010|publisher=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|others=Sarwark, John F.|isbn=9780892035793|location=Rosemont, Ill.|oclc=706805938}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of nonoperative approach to distal radius fractures is around 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Court-Brown|first=Charles M.|last2=Aitken|first2=Stuart|last3=Hamilton|first3=Thomas W.|last4=Rennie|first4=Louise|last5=Caesar|first5=Ben|title=Nonoperative Fracture Treatment in the Modern Era|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00005373-201009000-00036|journal=The Journal of Trauma: Injury, Infection, and Critical Care|volume=69|issue=3|pages=699–707|doi=10.1097/ta.0b013e3181b57ace}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonoperative management is indicated for fractures that are undisplaced, or for displaced fractures that are stable following reduction. Variations in immobilization techniques involve the type of cast, position of immobilization, and the length of time required in the cast.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

====Undisplaced fractures====
For those with low demand, cast and splint can be applied for two weeks. In those who are young and active, if the fracture is not displaced, the patient can be followed up in one week. If the fracture is still undisplaced, cast and splint can be applied for three weeks. If the fracture is displaced, then manipulative reduction or surgical stabilisation is required. Shorter immobilization is associated with better recovery when compared to prolonged immobilization. 10% of the minimally displaced fractures will become unstable in the first two weeks and cause [[malunion]]. Therefore, follow up within the first week of fracture is important. 22% of the minimally displaced fractures will malunite after two weeks. Subsequent follow ups at two to three weeks are therefore also important.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

Where the fracture is undisplaced and stable, nonoperative treatment involves immobilization. Initially, a backslab or a sugar tong splint is applied to allow swelling to expand and subsequently a cast is applied.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; Depending on the nature of the fracture, the cast may be placed above the elbow to control forearm rotation. However, an above-elbow cast may cause long-term rotational contracture.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; For [[torus fracture]]s, a splint may be sufficient and casting may be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1009|title=BestBets: Is a cast as useful as a splint in the treatment of a distal radius fracture in a child|work=|format=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the wrist in cast is usually slight flexion and ulnar deviation. However, neutral and dorsiflex position may not affect the stability of the fracture.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

====Displaced fractures====
In displaced distal radius fracture, in those with low demands, the hand can be casted until the person feels comfortable. If the fracture affects the [[median nerve]], only then is a reduction indicated. If the instability risk is less than 70%, the hand can be manipulated under regional block or general anaesthesia to achieve reduction. If the post reduction radiology of the wrist is acceptable, then the person can come for follow up at one, two, or three weeks to look for any displacement of fractures during this period. If the reduction is maintained, then the cast should continue for 4 to 6 weeks. If the fracture is displaced, surgical management is the proper treatment. If the instability risk of the wrist is more than 70%, then surgical management is required. 43% of displaced fractures will be unstable within the first two weeks and 47% of the remaining unstable fractures will become unstable after two weeks. Therefore, periodic reviews are important to prevent malunion of the displaced fractures.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

Closed reduction of a distal radius fracture involves first [[Anesthesia|anesthetizing]] the affected area with a [[hematoma block]], [[intravenous regional anesthesia]] (Bier's block), [[sedation]] or a [[general anesthesia]].&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; Manipulation generally includes first placing the arm under traction and unlocking the fragments. The deformity is then reduced with appropriate closed manipulative (depending on the type of deformity)  [[Reduction (orthopedic surgery)|reduction]], after which a splint or cast is placed and an [[X-ray]] is taken to ensure that the reduction was successful. The cast is usually maintained for about 6 weeks.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

====Outcome of nonoperative treatment ====
Failure of nonoperative treatment leading to functional impairment and anatomic deformity is the largest risk associated with conservative management. Prior studies have shown that the fracture often redisplaces to its original position even in a cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbaszadegan|first1=H|last2=von Sivers|first2=K|last3=Jonsson|first3=U|year=1988|title=Late displacement of Colles' fractures|journal=Int Orthop|volume=12|issue=3|pages=197–9|doi=10.1007/BF00547163|pmid=3182123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 27-32% of fractures are in acceptable alignment 5 weeks after closed reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Earnshaw|first1=SA|last2=Aladin|first2=A|last3=Surendran|first3=S|last4=Moran|first4=CG|date=March 2002|title=Closed reduction of colles fractures: Comparison of manual manipulation and finger-trap traction: a prospective, randomized study|journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am|volume=84-A|issue=3|pages=354–8|pmid=11886903}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those less than 60 years in age, there will be a dorsal angulation of 13 degrees, while for those older than 60, the dorsal angulation can reach as high as 18 degrees. In people over 60, functional impairment can last for more than 10 years.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

Despite these risks with nonoperative treatment, more recent systematic reviews suggest that when indicated, nonsurgical management in the elderly population may lead to similar functional outcomes as surgical approaches. In these studies,  no significant differences in pain scores, grip strength, and range of motion in patients' wrists occurred when comparing conservative nonsurgical approaches with surgical management. Although the nonsurgical group exhibited greater anatomic misalignment such as radial deviation, and ulnar variance, these changes did not seem to have significant impact on overall pain and quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ju|first=Ji-Hui|last2=Jin|first2=Guang-Zhe|last3=Li|first3=Guan-Xing|last4=Hu|first4=Hai-Yang|last5=Hou|first5=Rui-Xing|date=2015-10-01|title=Comparison of treatment outcomes between nonsurgical and surgical treatment of distal radius fracture in elderly: a systematic review and meta-analysis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00423-015-1324-9|journal=Langenbeck's Archives of Surgery|language=en|volume=400|issue=7|pages=767–779|doi=10.1007/s00423-015-1324-9|issn=1435-2443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surgery ===
The techniques of surgical management include [[Internal fixation|open reduction internal fixation]] (ORIF), [[external fixation]], [[percutaneous pinning]], or some combination of the above. The choice of operative treatment is often determined by the type of fracture, which can be categorized broadly into three groups: partial articular fractures, displaced articular fractures, and metaphyseal unstable extra- or minimal articular fractures.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

Significant advances have been made in ORIF treatments. Two newer treatment are fragment-specific fixation and fixed-angle volar plating. These attempt fixation rigid enough to allow almost immediate mobility, in an effort to minimize stiffness and improve ultimate function; no improved final outcome from early mobilization (prior to 6 weeks after surgical fixation) has been shown. Although restoration of radiocarpal alignment is thought to be of obvious importance, the exact amount of angulation, shortening, intra-articular gap/step which impact final function are not exactly known. The alignment of the DRUJ is also important, as this can be a source of a pain and loss of rotation after final healing and maximum recovery.

An [[Arthroscopy|arthroscope]] can be used at the time of fixation to evaluate for soft-tissue injury.  Structures at risk include the triangular fibrocartilage complex and the scapholunate ligament. Scapholunate injuries in radial styloid fractures where the fracture line exits distally at the scapholunate interval should be considered. TFCC injuries causing obvious DRUJ instability can be addressed at the time of fixation.

Prognosis varies depending on dozens of variables. If the [[anatomy]] (bony alignment) is not properly restored, function may remain poor even after healing. Restoration of bony alignment is not a guarantee of success, as soft tissue contributes significantly to the healing process.

====  Little joint involvement ====
These fractures are the most common of the three groups mentioned above that require surgical management.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; A minimal articular fracture involves the joint, but does not require reduction of the joint. Manipulative reduction and immobilization were thought to be appropriate for metaphyseal unstable fractures. However, several studies suggest this approach is largely ineffective in patients with high functional demand, and in this case, more stable fixation techniques should be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McQueen|first=M.

Surgical options have been shown to be successful in patients with unstable extra-articular or minimal articular distal radius fractures. These options include percutaneous pinning, external fixation, and ORIF using plating. Patients with low functional demand of their wrists can be treated successfully with nonsurgical management; however, in more active and fit patients with fractures that are reducible by closed means, nonbridging external fixation is preferred, as it has less serious complications when compared to other surgical options.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; The most common complication associated with nonbridging external fixation is pin tract infection, which can be managed with antibiotics and frequent dressing changes, and rarely results in reoperation.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; The external fixator is placed for 5 to 6 weeks and can be removed in an outpatient setting.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

If the fractures are unlikely to be reduced by closed means, open reduction with internal plate fixation is preferred.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; Although major complications (i.e. tendon injury, fracture collapse, or malunion) result in higher reoperation rates (36.5%) compared to external fixation (6%), ORIF is preferred, as this provides better stability and restoration of the volar tilt.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gradl|first=Georg|last2=Gradl|first2=Gertraud|last3=Wendt|first3=Martina|last4=Mittlmeier|first4=Thomas|last5=Kundt|first5=Guenther|last6=Jupiter|first6=Jesse B.|date=2013-05-01|title=Non-bridging external fixation employing multiplanar K-wires versus volar locked plating for dorsally displaced fractures of the distal radius|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00402-013-1698-5|journal=Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery|language=en|volume=133|issue=5|pages=595–602|doi=10.1007/s00402-013-1698-5|issn=0936-8051}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the operation, a removable splint is placed for 2 weeks, during which time patients should mobilize the wrist as tolerated.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

==== Displaced intra-articular fractures ====
These fractures, although less common, often require surgery in active, healthy patients to address displacement of both the joint and the metaphysis. The two mainstays of treatment are bridging external fixation or ORIF. If reduction can be achieved by closed/percutaneous reduction, then open reduction can generally be avoided. Percutaneous pinning is preferred to plating due to similar clinical and radiological outcomes, as well as lower costs, when compared to plating, despite increased risk of superficial infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Mark S.|last2=Ghamsary|first2=Mark|last3=Guillen|first3=Phillip T.|last4=Wongworawat|first4=Montri D.|date=2017|title=Outcomes After Distal Radius Fracture Treatment With Percutaneous Wire Versus Plate Fixation: Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials|journal=Journal of Surgical Orthopaedic Advances|volume=26|issue=1|pages=7–17|issn=1548-825X|pmid=28459418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Level of joint restoration, as opposed to surgical technique, has been found to be a better indicator of functional outcomes.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

==Outcome==
[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) divides outcomes into three categories: impairment, disabilities, and handicaps. Impairment is the abnormal physical function, such as lack of forearm rotation. It is measured clinically. Disability is the lack of ability to perform physical daily activities. It is measured by Patient Reported Outome Measures (PROMs). Examples of scoring system based on clinical assessment are: Mayo Wrist Score (for perilunate fracture dislocation), Green and O’Brien Score (carpal dislocation and pain), and Gartland and Werley Score (evaluating distal radius fractures). These scores includes assessment of [[range of motion]], grip strength, ability to perform activities of daily living, and radiological picture. However, none of the three scoring system demonstrated good reliability.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

There are also two scoring systems for Patient Reported Outome Measures (PROMs): the Disabilities of Hand, Arm and Shoulder (DASH) Score and the Patient-Related Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) Score. These scoring systems measures the ability of a person to perform a task, pain score, presence of tingling and numbness, the effect on activities of daily living, and self-image. Both scoring systems show good reliability and validity.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

=== Complications ===
[[Nonunion]] is rare; almost all of these fractures heal. [[Malunion]], however, is not uncommon, and can lead to residual pain, grip weakness, reduced range of motion (especially rotation), and persistent deformity. Symptomatic malunion may require additional surgery. If the joint surface is damaged and heals with more than 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm of unevenness, the wrist joint will be prone to post-traumatic [[osteoarthritis]]. Half of nonosteoporotic patients will develop post-traumatic arthritis, specifically limited radial deviation and wrist flexion. This arthritis can worsen over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lameijer|first=C. M.|last2=Ten Duis|first2=H. J.|last3=Dusseldorp|first3=I. van|last4=Dijkstra|first4=P.

Nerve injury, especially of the median nerve and presenting as carpal tunnel syndrome, is commonly reported following distal radius fractures. Tendon injury can occur in people treated both nonoperatively and operatively, most commonly to the [[Extensor pollicis longus muscle|extensor pollicis longus]] tendon. This can be due to the tendon coming in contact with protruding bone or with hardware placed following surgical procedures.

Complex regional pain syndrome is also associated with distal radius fractures, and can present with pain, swelling, changes in color and temperature, and/or joint contracture. The cause for this condition is unknown.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rockwood and Green's Fractures in Adults.|last1=Ricci|first1=editors, Robert W. Bucholz ... [et al.] ; associate editors, Margaret M. McQueen, William M.|date=2015|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=|isbn=978-1451175318|edition=8th|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age factor ===
In children, the outcome of distal radius fracture treatment in casts is usually very successful with healing and return to normal function expected. Some residual deformity is common, but this often remodels as the child grows. 

In young patients, the injury requires greater force and results in more displacement, particularly to the articular surface.  Unless an accurate reduction of the joint surface is obtained, these patients are very likely to have long-term symptoms of pain, arthritis, and stiffness.

In the elderly, distal radius fractures heal and may result in adequate function following nonoperative treatment. A large proportion of these fractures occur in elderly people who may have less requirement for strenuous use of their wrists. Some of these patients tolerate severe deformities and minor loss of wrist motion very well, even without reduction of the fracture. There is no difference in functional outcomes between operative and non-operative management in the elderly age group, despite better anatomical results in the operative group.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Distal radius fractures are the most common fractures seen in adults, accounting for 17.5% of all adult fractures with an approximate rate of 23.6 to 25.8 per 100,000 per year. Incidences in females outnumber incidences in males by a factor of three to two. Average age of occurrence is between 57 and 66 years. Men who sustain distal radius fractures are usually younger, generally in their 40s (vs. 60s in females). Low energy injury (usually fall from standing height) is the usual cause of distal end radius fracture (66 to 77% of cases). High energy injuries accounts for 10% of wrist fractures.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt; About 57% to 66% of the fractures are extra-articular fractures, 9% to 16% are partial-articular fractures, and 25% to 35% are complete articular fractures. Unstable metaphyseal fractures are ten times more common than severe articular fractures. Older people with osteoporosis who are still active are at an increased risk of getting distal radius fractures.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove|date=June 2018|section}}
Before the 18th century, distal radius fracture was believed to be due to dislocation of the [[carpal bones]] or the displacement of the [[distal radioulnar articulation]]. In the 18th century, Petit first suggested that these types of injuries might be due to fractures rather than dislocations. Another author, Pouteau, suggested the common mechanism of injury which leads to this type of fractures - injury to the wrist when a person falls on an outstretched hand with dorsal displacement of the wrist. However, he also suggested that volar displacement of the wrist was due to the ulnar fracture. His work was met with skepticism from colleagues and little recognition, since the article was published after he died. In 1814, Abraham Colles described the characteristics of distal end radius fracture. In 1841, Guilaume Dupuytren acknowledged the contributions by Petit and Pouteau, agreeing that the distal end radius fracture is indeed a fracture, not a dislocation. In 1847, Malgaigne described the mechanism of injury for distal end radius fractures which can be caused by falling on the outstretched hand or on the back of the hand, and also the consequences if the hand fracture is not treated adequately. After that, Robert William Smith, professor of surgery in Dublin, Ireland, first described the characteristics of volar displacement of distal radius fractures. In 1895, with the advent of X-rays, the visualisation of the distal radius fracture become more apparent. Lucas-Champonnière first described the management of fractures using massage and early mobilization techniques. [[Anaesthesia]], [[aseptic technique]], immbolization, and external fixation all have contributed to the management of fixation of distal radius fracture. Ombredanne, a Parisian surgeon in 1929, first reported the use of nonbridging external fixation in the management of distal radius fractures. Bridging external fixation was first introduced by Roger Anderson and Gordon O’Neill from [[Seattle]] in 1944 due to poor results in conservative management (using [[orthopaedic cast]]) of distal end radius fractures. Raoul Hoffman of [[Geneva]] designed orthopaedic clamps which allow adjustments of the external fixator to reduce the fractures by closed reduction. In 1907, percutaneous pinning was first used. This was followed by the use of plating in 1965.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"/&gt;

[[Image:M104 ngc4594 sombrero galaxy hi-res.jpg|thumb|alt=The dark band of the "dust lane" is clearly visible against the brighter background of stars within the Sombrero Galaxy.|The [[Sombrero Galaxy]] features a prominent dust lane.]]

A '''dust lane''' is a relatively dense obscuring band of [[interstellar dust]], observed as a dark swath against the background of a brighter object, especially a [[galaxy]]. These dust lanes can usually be seen in [[spiral galaxies]] (e.g., the [[Milky Way]]) when viewed from the edge. Due to the dense and relatively thick nature of this dust, light from the galaxy is [[Extinction (astronomy)|reduced by several magnitudes]]. In the Milky Way, this reduction of light makes it impossible to see the light from the central [[Bulge (astronomy)|bulge of the galaxy]] from Earth. This dust, as well as the gasses also found within these lanes, mix together and combine to [[Star formation|form]] stars and [[Planet|planets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Galaxies in the Universe|last=Sparke|first=L.

Economic oppression may take several forms, including the practice of [[bonded labour]] in some parts of [[India]]; [[serfdom]]; [[forced labour]]; low wages; denial of [[equal opportunity]]; practicing [[employment discrimination]]; and [[economic discrimination]] based on [[gender|sex]], [[nationality]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Analyzing oppression|first= Ann E. |last=Cudd|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year= 2006|ISBN=0-19-518744-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The term '''[[Oppression#Economic_oppression|economic oppression]]''' is sometimes misunderstood in the sense of [[economic sanction]],  [[embargo]] or [[Boycott|economic boycott]] which each have different significances. The contextual application and significance of the term '''[[Oppression#Economic_oppression|economic oppression]]''' has been changing over a period of time.

'''Emergent''' (formerly PDP++) is [[Neural network software|neural simulation software]] that is primarily intended for creating models of the brain and cognitive processes. Development initially began in 1995 at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], and {{As of|2014|lc=on}}, continues at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. The 3.x release of the software, which was known as PDP++, is featured in the textbook ''Computational Explorations in Cognitive Neuroscience''.

== Features ==
Emergent features a modular design, based on the principles of [[object-oriented programming]]. It runs on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] / [[macOS]] and [[Linux]]. C-Super-Script (variously, CSS and C^C), a built-in C++-like interpreted scripting language, allows access to virtually all simulator objects and can initiate all the same actions as the [[GUI]], and more. Version 4 and upward features a full 3D environment for visualizations, based on [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] and [[Open Inventor]]. Robotics simulations are made possible by integration with the [[Open Dynamics Engine]]. A plugin system allows for expanding the software in many ways. Version 5 introduced parallel threading support, numerous speed improvements, a help browser featuring an interface to the project's Wiki and auto-generated documentation, undo and redo using diffs and a definable undo depth. In addition, 5.0.2 introduced a built-in plugin [[source code editor]], and plugins can now be compiled from the main interface, enabling full development of plugins within Emergent.

Emergent also provides an implementation of [[Leabra]] which was developed by [[Randall C. O'Reilly]] in his PhD thesis.&lt;ref&gt;http://psych.colorado.edu/~oreilly/pubs-abstr.html#OReilly96phd&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Explorer 35''' (IMP-E, AIMP 2, Anchored IMP 2, Interplanetary Monitoring Platform-E) was a spin-stabilized spacecraft instrumented for interplanetary studies, at lunar distances, of the interplanetary [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], [[magnetic field]], [[energetic particle]]s, and solar [[X rays]]. It was launched into an elliptical lunar [[orbit]]. The spin axis direction was nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, and the spin rate was 25.6 rpm. Mission objectives were achieved. After successful operation for 6 years, the spacecraft was turned off on June 24, 1973.

==Science instruments==

===Magnetometers===
The Ames [[magnetometer]] experiment consisted of a boom-mounted triaxial fluxgate magnetometer and an electronics package. The sensors were orthogonally mounted, with one sensor oriented along the spin axis of the spacecraft. A motor interchanged a sensor in the spin plane with the sensor along the spin axis every 24 hours, allowing inflight calibration. The instrument package included a circuit for demodulating the outputs from the sensors in the spin plane. The noise threshold was about 0.2 [[nanotesla|nT]] . The instrument had three ranges covering plus or minus 20, 60, and 200 nT full scale for each vector component. The digitization accuracy for each range was 1% of the entire range covered. The magnetic field vector was measured instantaneously, and the instrument range was changed after each measurement. A period of 2.05 seconds elapsed between adjacent measurements and a period of 6.14 s elapsed between measurements using the same range. The instrument performance was normal.

The experiment consisted of a boom-mounted triaxial fluxgate magnetometer. Each sensor had dual ranges of minus to plus 24 nT and 64 nT, with digitization resolutions of minus to plus 0.094 nT and 0.25 nT, respectively. Zero level drift was checked by periodic reorientation of the sensors until May 20, 1969, when the flipper mechanism failed. Past this point, data analysis was more difficult as the zero level drift of the sensor parallel to the spacecraft spin axis was not readily determined. Spacecraft interference was less than 0.125 nT. One vector measurement was obtained each 5.12 s. The bandpass of the magnetometer was 0 to 5&amp;nbsp;Hz, with a 20-dB per decade decrease for higher frequencies. Except for the flipper failure, the experiment functioned normally from launch to spacecraft turnoff (June 24, 1973).

===Bistatic Radar Observations===
The purpose of this experiment was to study the electromagnetic reflective properties of the lunar surface. The 136.10-MHz (2.2 m) telemetry transmissions from the spacecraft were scattered from the lunar surface and then recorded by use of the 150-ft [[Stanford]] dish antenna. The reflected signal intensity depended upon the lunar reflectivity, the spacecraft altitude above the lunar surface, and the mean curvature of the Moon. The returned signal bandwidth was proportional to RMS lunar surface slopes. [[Occultation]] phenomena permitted a determination of the scattering properties of the lunar limb. The dielectric constant of the lunar subsurface in the scattering region below a depth of about 25&amp;nbsp;cm was then determined from a profile of reflectivity values vs the angle of incidence on the Moon. The mean lunar slope over each area from which signals were reflected has also been inferred. The observations were located within about 10 degrees of the lunar equator. Experiment operation was normal as of March 1971.

===Ion chambers and Geiger tubes===
This experiment consisted of a 12-cm [[Neher]]-type [[ionization chamber]] and two Lionel type 205 HT [[Geiger-Müller tube|Geiger-Müller]] (GM) tubes. The ion chamber responded omnidirectionally to electrons above 0.7 MeV and protons above 12 M[[Electronvolt|eV]]. Both GM tubes were mounted parallel to the spacecraft spin axis. GM tube 1 detected electrons above 45 keV that were scattered off a gold foil. The acceptance cone for these electrons had a 70-deg full-angle and an axis of symmetry that was 20 deg off the spacecraft spin axis. GM tube 2 responded to electrons and protons above 22 and 300 keV, respectively, in an acceptance cone of 70-deg full-angle centered at the spacecraft spin axis. Both GM tubes responded omnidirectionally to electrons and protons of energies above 2.5 and 50 MeV, respectively. Pulses from the ion chamber and counts from each GM tube were accumulated for 39.72 s and read out every 40.96 s. In addition, the time between the first ion chamber pulses in an accumulation period was also telemetered. This experiment performed well initially.

===Micrometeoroid detector===
This experiment was designed to measure the ionization, momentum, speed, and direction of micrometeorites, using thin film charged detectors, induction devices, and microphones.

===Faraday cup===
A multigrid, split-collector [[Faraday cup]] mounted on the equator of the spacecraft was used to study the directional intensity of solar wind positive ions and electrons with particular emphasis on the interaction of the solar wind with the Moon. Twenty-seven integral current samples (requiring about 4.3 s) were taken in an energy-per-charge window from 80 to 2850 eV. Then the current was sampled in eight differential energy-per-charge windows between 50 and 5400 eV at the azimuth where the peak current appeared in the previous series of integral measurements. These measurements (integral and differential) took about 25 s. Both the sum and difference of collector currents were obtained for positive ions. Only the sum was obtained for electrons. A complete set of measurements (two collector plate sums and one difference for protons, and one collector plate sum for electrons) required 328 s. The experiment worked well from launch until its failure in July 1968.

A '''gender expression''' is a person's behavior, mannerisms, interests, and appearance that are associated with [[gender]] in a particular cultural context, specifically with the categories of [[femininity]] or [[masculinity]]. This also includes [[gender role]]s. These categories rely on [[stereotype]]s about gender.
==Defining gender expression==

Gender expression typically reflects a person's [[gender identity]] (their internal sense of their own gender), but this is not always the case.&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=Randal W.|title=Social Psychology: How Other People Influence Our Thoughts and Actions [2 volumes]|date=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610695923|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nF1DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA232|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=American Psychological Association|title=Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People|journal=American Psychologist|date=December 2015|volume=70|issue=9|page=861|url=http://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf|doi=10.1037/a0039906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender expression is separate and independent both from [[sexual orientation]] and [[Sex assignment|gender assigned at birth]]. A type of gender expression that is considered atypical for a person's externally perceived gender may be described as [[Gender variance|gender non-conforming]].

In men and boys, typical gender expression is often described as ''manly'', while atypical expression is known as [[Effeminacy|effeminate]]. In girls, atypical expression is called [[tomboy]]ish. In (especially queer) women, atypical and typical expression are known as [[butch and femme]] respectively. A mixture of typical and atypical expression may be described as [[Androgyny|androgynous]]. A type of expression that is perceived as neither typically feminine or masculine can be described as gender-neutral or undifferentiated.

The term ''gender expression'' is used in the [[Yogyakarta Principles]], which concern the application of international [[human rights law]] in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and [[Sex characteristics (legal term)|sex characteristics]].&lt;ref name="ypplus10"&gt;[http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles-en/yp10/ Yogyakarta Principles plus 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluating gender expression==

The [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]] was designed to evaluate gender expression objectively (within a White American cultural context).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5710">'''Howard Turner Barnes''' (21 July 1873, [[Woburn, Massachusetts]] – 4 October 1950, [[Burlington, Vermont]]) was an American-Canadian physicist who specialized in calorimetry, electrolytes, ice formation and ice engineering.&lt;ref name="FRSobit"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Foster, J.

Norman|title=Howard Turner Barnes|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada |series=Series 3|volume=45|year=1951|pages=77–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
In 1879, Howard T. Barnes moved with his family from Massachusetts to Montreal. where his father was appointed minister of Montreal's Unitarian church. After attending secondary school in Montreal, he entered in 1889 [[McGill University]], where he received in 1893 his bachelor's degree in physics and, after working there as a demonstrator in chemistry, an M.S. in Applied Science in 1896. He became at McGill a demonstrator in physics and worked under [[Hugh Longbourne Callendar|Hugh L. Callendar]]. In 1898, [[Ernest Rutherford]] succeeded to Callendar's professorial chair and supervised Barnes, among others. In 1899 Barnes went to the U.K. on a scholarship from the [[Royal Society of London|Royal Society]]; he returned to McGill in 1900 as a lecturer in physics. In 1900 he received a D.Sc. from McGill, where he became an assistant professor in 1901 and associate professor in 1906. In 1907 he succeeded Ernest Rutherford as Macdonald Professor of Physician, but resigned his chair in 1919. In the early 1920s he again became a professor at McGill, where he remained until his retirement as professor emeritus in 1933.&lt;ref name="EncCom"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830905005.html Barnes, Howard Turner, encyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes worked with Callendar on extremely precise measurements in constant-flow calorimetry, in which a given amount of electrical energy is added to a given mass of flowing liquid whose consequent increase in temperature is precisely measured. Barnes pioneered the constant-flow calorimeter which is used by contemporary physical chemists. He also studied turbulence, electrolytes, and the heat effects of radium. In the 1920s, he became a world-class expert on [[anchor ice]], [[frazil ice]], and ice engineering.&lt;ref name=EncCom/&gt;

{{quote|Most noteworthy are his determination of the mechanical equivalent of heat and of the specific heat of water over the full range of temperature. Later he studied ice formation and became world famous, not only for his highly original and practical methods for the removal of ice jams, but for the great skill with which he used them.&lt;ref name=FRSobit/&gt;}}

==Awards and honours==
Barnes was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1908 and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1911. He was honoured as the Tyndall Lecturer for 1912 at the Royal Institution in London.

'''Irregular warfare''' is defined in [[United States]] joint doctrine as “A violent struggle among state and non-state actors for legitimacy and influence over the relevant populations.”&lt;ref&gt;The Irregular Warrior, 4 October 2015 [http://irregularwarrior.com/2015/10]&lt;/ref&gt;

Irregular warfare favors indirect and asymmetric warfare approaches, though it may employ the full range of military and other capabilities, in order to erode the adversary’s power, influence, and will. It is inherently a protracted struggle that will test the resolve of a [[State (polity)|state]] and its strategic partners.&lt;ref&gt;"Irregular Warfare (IW) Joint Operating Concept (JOC)", Version 1.0, [[United States Department of Defense]], 27 February 2009 [http://morsnet.pbwiki.com/f/MORS+IW+Mini-Symposium+TOR-final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"US Irregular Warfare (IW) Analysis Workshop", [[Military Operations Research Society]] (MORS), 11 September 2007 [http://www.dtic.mil/futurejointwarfare/concepts/iw_joc1_0.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dodd300007"&gt;"Irregular Warfare (IW)", DoD Directive 3000.07, [[United States Department of Defense]], 1 December 2008 [http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/300007p.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Quadrennial Roles &amp; Missions (QRM) Review Report", [[United States Department of Defense]], January 2009 [http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jan2009/QRMFinalReport_v26Jan.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Irregular Warfare", Doctrine Document 2-3, [[United States Air Force]], 1 August 2007 [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA471742]&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts associated with irregular warfare are older than the term itself.&lt;ref name="gates"&gt;Gates, John M., "The U.S. Army and Irregular Warfare", The College of Wooster {{cite web |url=http://www3.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-contents.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623141322/http://www.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-contents.html |archivedate=2009-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origination of the term ===
The distinction between regular and irregular forces is unrelated to the term "irregular warfare." The term, irregular warfare, was settled upon in distinction from "traditional warfare" and "unconventional warfare", and to differentiate it as such.

=== Early use ===
One of the earliest known uses of the term ''irregular warfare'' is in the 1986 English edition of "Modern Irregular Warfare in Defense Policy and as a Military Phenomenon" by [[Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte]].  The original 1972 German edition of the book is titled "Der Moderne Kleinkrieg als Wehrpolitisches und Militarisches Phänomen".  The German word "Kleinkrieg" is literally translated as "Small War".&lt;ref&gt;Moses, A. Dirk, "German intellectuals and the Nazi past," {{ISBN|978-0-521-86495-4}}, 2007 [https://books.google.com/books?id=P1KoR4vF3ysC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=Kleinkrieg+%22Small+War%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K4n_4koqOr&amp;sig=edxYQjmQRaz1H3Z73IPzXkre_Ls&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fEOYSjOpsfEGvf2BxgE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Kleinkrieg%20%22Small%20War%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "Irregular", used in the title of the English translation of the book, seems to be a reference non "regular armed forces" as per the aforementioned [[Third Geneva Convention]].

=== US DoD use ===
One of the earliest known uses of the term IW is in a 1996 [[Central Intelligence Agency]] document by [[Jeffrey B. White]].&lt;ref name="white"&gt;White, Jeffrey B., "A Different Kind of Threat, Some Thoughts on Irregular Warfare", CIA, 1996 [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/96unclass/iregular.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Major [[military doctrine]] developments related to IW were done between 2004 and 2007&lt;ref&gt;"The National Military Strategy of the United States of America", [[United States Department of Defense]], 2004 [http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/ksil429.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, LTC Frank A., "Irregular Warfare – Perhaps Not So "Irregular"", U.S. Army War College, 15 March 2006 [http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/ksil429.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The National Security Strategy of the United States of America", National Security Council, 2002 [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/national/nss-020920.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; A key proponent of IW within US DoD is [[Michael G. Vickers]], a former paramilitary officer in the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Greg, "The Man Behind Irregular Warfare Push: Mike Vickers", DoD BUZZ, 7 April 2009 [http://www.dodbuzz.com/2009/04/07/the-man-behind-irregular-warfare-push-mike-vickers/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===US CIA use===

The [[CIA]]'s [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD) is the premiere{{clarify|date=April 2018}} unit for unconventional warfare, both for creating and for combating irregular warfare units.&lt;ref&gt;Southworth, Samuel A., Tanner, Stephen, ''U.S. Special Forces: A Guide to America's Special Operations Units: the World's Most Elite Fighting Force'', Da Capo Press, {{ISBN|0-306-81165-0}}, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101030203/|title=Waller, Douglas, "The CIA Secret Army", Time Inc., 3 February 2003|author=|date=|website=time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Kathryn &amp; Williams, Anthony R., ''All Necessary Means: Employing CIA operatives in a Warfighting Role Alongside Special Operations Forces'', [[United States Army War College]] (USAWC), 7 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, SAD paramilitary officers created and led successful irregular units from the Hmong tribe during the war in Laos in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;''Shooting at the Moon: The Story of America's Clandestine War in Laos'', Steerforth Press, {{ISBN|978-1-883642-36-5}}, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Northern Alliance]] against the [[Taliban]] during the war in Afghanistan in 2001&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Woodward|Woodward, Bob]], ''Bush at War'', Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|0-7432-0473-5}}, 19 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and from the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Peshmerga]] against [[Ansar al-Islam]] and the forces of [[Saddam Hussein]] during the war in Iraq in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Mike &amp; Faddis, Charles, ''Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq'', The Lyons Press, {{ISBN|978-1-59921-366-8}}, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Bob, ''Plan of Attack'', Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|978-0-7432-5547-9}}, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other definitions==
* IW is a form of warfare that has as its objective the credibility and/or legitimacy of the relevant political authority with the goal of undermining or supporting that authority. IW favors indirect approaches, though it may employ the full range of military and other capabilities to seek asymmetric approaches, in order to erode an adversary’s power, influence, and will.&lt;ref&gt;"Irregular Warfare Special Study", [[United States Joint Forces Command]] Joint Warfighting Center, 4 August 2006 [http://merln.ndu.edu/archive/digitalcollections/irregwarfarespecialstudy.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* IW is defined as a violent struggle among [[State (polity)|state]] and non-state actors for [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and influence over the relevant [[population]](s)
* IW involves conflicts in which enemy combatants are not regular military forces of nation-states.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Quadrennial Defense Review]] Report", [[United States Department of Defense]], 6 February 2006 [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/dod/qdr-2006-report.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* IW is "war among the people" as opposed to "industrial war" (i.e. regular war).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rdsc.md.government.bg/BG/Activities/Publication/MilitaryLead/3-4-Benest.pdf Benest, David, "British Leaders and Irregular Warfare," 29 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
Activities and types of conflict included in IW are:
* [[Colonial war]]
* [[Asymmetric warfare]]
* [[Insurgency]]/[[Counter-insurgency]] (COIN)
* [[Terrorism]]/[[Counter-terrorism]]
* [[Stabilization, Security, Transition, and Reconstruction Operations]] (SSTRO)
* [[Unconventional warfare]] (UW)
* [[Guerrilla warfare]] (GW)
* [[Foreign internal defense]] (FID)
* [[Civil-military operations]] (CMO)
* [[Military Intelligence]] and [[counter-intelligence]] activities
* [[Transnational crime|Transnational]] [[criminal activities]] that support or sustain IW:
** [[narco-trafficking]]
** [[Illicit arms trafficking]]
** illegal [[financial transactions]]
* [[Outline of law enforcement|Law enforcement]] activities focused on countering irregular adversaries

According to the DoD, there are five core activities of IW:&lt;ref&gt;The Core Activities of Irregular Warfare, The Irregular Warrior, [http://irregularwarrior.com/the-core-activities-of-irregular-warfare]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Counter-insurgency]] (COIN)
* [[Counter-terrorism]] (CT)
* [[Unconventional warfare]] (UW)
* [[Foreign internal defense]] (FID)
* [[Stability Operations]] (SO)

==Examples==
Nearly all modern wars include at least some element of irregular warfare. Since the time of Napoleon, approximately 80% of conflict has been irregular in nature.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The Imperitive: Irregular Warfare and the Future of Security, The Irregular Warrior, [http://irregularwarrior.com/the-imperitive-irregular-warfare-and-the-future-of-security]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the following conflicts may be considered to have exemplified by irregular warfare:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;

* [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan Civil War]]
* [[Algerian War]]
* [[American Indian Wars]]
* [[American Revolutionary War]]&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;According to the definition of "regular forces", which came much after the [[American Revolutionary War]] ([[American Revolutionary War|ARW]]), the American forces did not meet the following criteria at all times during the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]]:
* having a fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at a distance
* carrying arms openly
* conducting operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war
&lt;br&gt;
Notwithstanding, in terms of modern international humanitarian law which was also developed much later than the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]], the American forces formed part of the armed forces of a party to an armed conflict but not belonging to that party's regular forces (since the [[United States of America]] did not exist and hence could not have had regular forces; the American forces were an insurgency at least until 1776) and operating in or outside of their own territory even if the territory is under occupation.

American forces did become regular forces but cannot be considered regular forces during the entire period of the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]]. For example, the American flag got established (1777) 2 years after the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]] started (1775). Also, there were great disparities between the American and British forces.  It was not until France started to assist American forces (1778) that the disparity started to be narrowed.  Conflict during the disparity surely counts as [[Asymmetric warfare]]. Also, the [[Boston Tea Party]] (1773) can be viewed as [[guerrilla]] tactics.  At the very least, a good portion of the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]] should be counted as IW although the entire [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]] being counted as IW is controversial.  However, since more than 1/2 of the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]] was fought as [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]] then it is thought that it is safe to classify it as IW even though that the American forces acted in all respects as regular forces towards the end of the conflict.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Revolution 1774-1783|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mQCRNfiB1-EC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=american+revolution+irregular+warfare#v=onepage&amp;q=american%20revolution%20irregular%20warfare&amp;f=false | first=Daniel | last=Marston | isbn=978-1-84176-343-9 | year=2002 | publisher=Osprey Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wargames and exercises==
There have been several military [[Military simulation|wargames]] and [[military exercises]] associated with IW, including:
* Unified Action &lt;ref&gt;http://www.citmo.net/library/Military%20Support%20to%20Unified%20Action%20-%20ROL%20Focus%20for%20Policing%20WS.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;

* Joint Irregular Warrior Series war games,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* Expeditionary Warrior war game series,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and 
* a December 2011 Naval War College Maritime Stability Operations Game focused specifically on stability operations in the maritime domain conducted by the Naval Service.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Modeling and simulation ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21929">'''Length measurement''' is implemented in practice in many ways. The most commonly used approaches are the transit-time methods and the interferometer methods based upon the [[speed of light]]. For objects such as crystals and [[diffraction grating]]s, [[diffraction]] is used with [[X-ray]]s and [[electron beam]]s. Measurement techniques for three-dimensional structures very small in every dimension use specialized instruments such as [[Focused ion beam#FIB imaging|ion microscopy]] coupled with intensive computer modeling.

For a discussion of astronomical methods for determining cosmological distances, see the article [[Cosmic distance ladder]].

== Standard rulers ==
The [[ruler]] the simplest kind of length measurement tool: lengths are defined by printed marks or engravings on a stick. The [[meter]] was initially defined using a ruler before more accurate methods became available.

[[Gauge block]]s are a common method for precise measurement or calibration of measurement tools.

For small or microscopic objects, microphotography where the length is calibrated using a graticule can be used. A graticule is a piece that has lines for precise lengths etched into it. Graticules may be fitted into the eyepiece or they may be used on the measurement plane.

==Transit-time measurement==
The basic idea behind a transit-time measurement of length is to send a signal from one end of the length to be measured to the other, and back again. The time for the round trip is the transit time Δt, and the length ℓ is then 2ℓ = Δt*"v",with ''v'' the speed of propagation of the signal, assuming that is the same in both directions. If light is used for the signal, its [[speed of light|speed]] depends upon the medium in which it propagates; in [[SI units]] the speed is a defined value ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the reference medium of [[Vacuum#Electromagnetism|classical vacuum]]. Thus, when light is used in a transit-time approach,  length measurements are not subject to knowledge of the source frequency (apart from possible frequency dependence of the correction to relate the medium to classical vacuum), but are subject to the error in measuring transit times, in particular, errors introduced by the response times of the pulse emission and detection instrumentation. An additional uncertainty is the ''refractive index correction'' relating the medium used to the reference vacuum, taken in SI units to be the [[Vacuum#Electromagnetism|classical vacuum]]. A [[refractive index]] of the medium larger than one slows the light.

Transit-time measurement underlies most radio navigation systems for boats and aircraft, for example, [[radar]] and the nearly obsolete Long Range Aid to Navigation [[LORAN|LORAN-C]]. For example, in one radar system, pulses of electromagnetic radiation are sent out by the vehicle (interrogating pulses) and trigger a response from a ''responder beacon''. The time interval between the sending and the receiving of a pulse is monitored and used to determine a distance. In the [[Global Positioning System|global positioning system]] a code of ones and zeros is emitted at a known time from multiple satellites, and their times of arrival are noted at a receiver along with the time they were sent (encoded in the messages). Assuming the receiver clock can be related to the synchronized clocks on the satellites, the ''transit time'' can be found and used to provide the distance to each satellite. Receiver clock error is corrected by combining the data from four satellites.&lt;ref name= GPS/&gt;

Such techniques vary in accuracy according to the distances over which they are intended for use. For example, LORAN-C is accurate to about {{nowrap|6 km,}} GPS about {{nowrap|10 m,}} enhanced GPS, in which a correction signal is transmitted from terrestrial stations (that is, [[differential GPS]] (DGPS)) or via satellites (that is, [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS)) can bring accuracy to a few meters or {{nowrap|&lt; 1 meter,}} or, in specific applications, tens of centimeters. Time-of-flight systems for robotics (for example, Laser Detection and Ranging [[Laser rangefinder|LADAR]] and Light Detection and Ranging [[LIDAR]]) aim at lengths of {{nowrap|10 - 100 m}} and have an accuracy of about {{nowrap|5 – 10 mm}}&lt;ref name=Siciliano/&gt;

==Interferometer measurements==
[[File:Michelson interferometer with corner cubes.png|thumb|Measuring a length in wavelengths of light using an [[interferometer]].]]
In many practical circumstances, and for precision work, measurement of dimension using transit-time measurements is used only as an initial indicator of length and is refined using an interferometer.&lt;ref name=Boyes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ye/&gt; Generally, transit time measurements are preferred for longer lengths, and interferometers for shorter lengths.&lt;ref name=Yoshizawa/&gt;

The figure shows schematically how length is determined using a [[Michelson interferometer]]: the two panels show a laser source emitting a light beam split by a ''[[beam splitter]]'' (BS) to travel two paths. The light is recombined by bouncing the two components off a pair of ''[[corner cubes]]'' (CC) that return the two components to the beam splitter again to be reassembled. The corner cube serves to displace the incident from the reflected beam, which avoids some complications caused by superposing the two beams.&lt;ref name=CC/&gt; The distance between the left-hand corner cube and the beam splitter is compared to that separation on the fixed leg as the left-hand spacing is adjusted to compare the length of the object to be measured.

In the top panel the path is such that the two beams reinforce each other after reassembly, leading to a strong light pattern (sun). The bottom panel shows a path that is made a half wavelength longer by moving the left-hand mirror a quarter wavelength further away, increasing the path difference by a half wavelength. The result is the two beams are in opposition to each other at reassembly, and the recombined light intensity drops to zero (clouds). Thus, as the spacing between the mirrors is adjusted, the observed light intensity cycles between reinforcement and cancellation as the number of wavelengths of path difference changes, and the observed intensity alternately peaks (bright sun) and dims (dark clouds). This behavior is called [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] and the machine is called an [[interferometer]]. By ''counting fringes'' it is found how many wavelengths long the measured path is compared to the fixed leg. In this way, measurements are made in units of wavelengths ''&amp;lambda;'' corresponding to a particular [[Atomic spectral line|atomic transition]]. The length in wavelengths can be converted to a length in units of metres if the selected transition has a known frequency ''f''. The length as a certain number of wavelengths ''&amp;lambda;'' is related to the metre using ''&amp;lambda;'' = {{nowrap|''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; / f''}}. With ''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' a defined value of 299,792,458&amp;nbsp;m/s, the error in a measured length in wavelengths is increased by this conversion to metres by the error in measuring the frequency of the light source.

By using sources of several wavelengths to generate sum and difference [[Envelope (waves)#Example: Beating waves|beat frequencies]], absolute distance measurements become possible.&lt;ref name=Zheng/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Paul/&gt;

This methodology for length determination requires a careful specification of the wavelength of the light used, and is one reason for employing a [[laser]] source where the wavelength can be held stable.  Regardless of stability, however, the precise frequency of any source has linewidth limitations.&lt;ref name= frequency/&gt; Other significant errors are introduced by the interferometer itself; in particular: errors in light beam alignment, collimation and fractional fringe determination.&lt;ref name=Yoshizawa/&gt;&lt;ref name=errors/&gt; Corrections also are made to account for departures of the medium (for example, air&lt;ref name=air/&gt;) from the reference medium of [[Vacuum#Electromagnetism|classical vacuum]]. Resolution using wavelengths is in the range of ΔL/L ≈ {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;}} depending upon the length measured, the wavelength and the type of interferometer used.&lt;ref name=errors/&gt;

The measurement also requires careful specification of the medium in which the light propagates. A ''refractive index correction'' is made to relate the medium used to the reference vacuum, taken in SI units to be the [[Vacuum#Electromagnetism|classical vacuum]]. These refractive index corrections can be found more accurately by adding frequencies, for example, frequencies at which propagation is sensitive to the presence of water vapor. This way non-ideal contributions to the refractive index can be measured and corrected for at another frequency using established theoretical models.

It may be noted again, by way of contrast, that the transit-time measurement of length is independent of any knowledge of the source frequency, except for a possible dependence of the correction relating the measurement medium to the reference medium of classical vacuum, which may indeed depend on the frequency of the source. Where a pulse train or some other wave-shaping is used, a range of frequencies may be involved.

==Diffraction measurements==
For small objects, different methods are used that also depend upon determining size in units of wavelengths. For instance, in the case of a crystal, atomic spacings can be determined using [[X-ray diffraction]].&lt;ref name=Mohr/&gt;  The present best value for the lattice parameter of silicon, denoted ''a'', is:&lt;ref name=silicon/&gt;

::a = 543.102 0504(89) × 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; m,

corresponding to a resolution of ΔL/L ≈ {{nowrap|3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;.}} Similar techniques can provide the dimensions of small structures repeated in large periodic arrays like a [[diffraction grating]].&lt;ref name=grating/&gt;

Such measurements allow the calibration of [[electron microscope]]s, extending measurement capabilities. For non-relativistic electrons in an electron microscope, the [[de Broglie wavelength]] is:&lt;ref name=Spence/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_e = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2m_e e V}} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

with ''V'' the electrical voltage drop traversed by the electron, ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' the electron mass, ''e'' the [[elementary charge]], and ''h'' the [[Planck constant]]. This wavelength can be measured in terms of inter-atomic spacing using a crystal diffraction pattern, and related to the metre through an optical measurement of the lattice spacing on the same crystal. This process of extending calibration is called ''[[metrological traceability]]''.&lt;ref name=traceability&gt;

See {{cite web |title=Metrological traceability |publisher=BIPM |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/bipm/calibrations/traceability.html |accessdate=2011-04-10}}

&lt;/ref&gt; The use of metrological traceability to connect different regimes of measurement is similar to the idea behind the [[cosmic distance ladder]] for different ranges of astronomical length. Both calibrate different methods for length measurement using overlapping ranges of applicability.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt;

==Other techniques==
Measuring dimensions of localized structures (as opposed to large arrays of atoms like a crystal), as in modern [[integrated circuit]]s, is done using the [[scanning electron microscope]]. This instrument bounces electrons off the object to be measured in a high vacuum enclosure, and the reflected electrons are collected as a photodetector image that is interpreted by a computer. These are not transit-time measurements, but are based upon comparison of [[Fourier transform]]s of images with theoretical results from computer modeling. Such elaborate methods are required because the image depends on the three-dimensional geometry of the measured feature, for example, the contour of an edge, and not just upon one- or two-dimensional properties. The underlying limitations are the beam width and the wavelength of the electron beam (determining [[diffraction]]), determined, as already discussed, by the electron beam energy.&lt;ref name=IC_linewidth&gt;

{{cite book |title=Handbook of photomask manufacturing technology |author=Michael T. Postek |editor=Syed Rizvi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Smk9-VI1fcC&amp;pg=PA485 |pages=457 ''ff'' |chapter=Photomask critical dimension metrology in the scanning electron microscope |isbn=0-8247-5374-7 |date=2005 |publisher=CRC Press}} and {{cite book |title= Principles of lithography |chapter=Chapter 9: Metrology |author=Harry J.

&lt;/ref&gt; 
The calibration of these scanning electron microscope measurements is tricky, as results depend upon the material measured and its geometry. A typical wavelength is {{nowrap|0.5 Å,}} and a typical resolution is about {{nowrap|4 nm.}}

Other small dimension techniques are the [[atomic force microscope]], the [[focused ion beam]] and the [[helium ion microscope]]. Calibration is attempted using standard samples measured by [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM).&lt;ref name=Orji&gt;

{{cite journal |title=TEM calibration methods for critical dimension standards |author=NG Orji |url=ftp://129.6.13.25/pub/eeel/cresswell/orji_spie_2007.pdf |date=2007 |journal= Proceedings of SPIE |volume= 6518 |pages=651810 |doi=10.1117/12.713368|author2=and others |displayauthors=1 |series=Metrology, Inspection, and Process Control for Microlithography XXI |last3=Garcia-Gutierrez |last4=Bunday |last5=Bishop |last6=Cresswell |last7=Allen |last8=Allgair |bibcode=2007SPIE.6518E..10O }}

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear Overhauser effect]] spectroscopy (NOESY) is a specialized type of [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] where distances between atoms can be measured. It is based on the effect where nuclear spin cross-relaxation after excitation by a radio pulse depends on the distance between the nuclei. Unlike spin-spin coupling, NOE propagates through space and does not require that the atoms are connected by bonds, so it is a true distance measurement instead of a chemical measurement. Unlike diffraction measurements, NOESY does not require a crystalline sample, but is done in solution state and can be applied to substances that are difficult to crystallize.

==Other systems of units==

In some systems of units, unlike the current SI system, lengths are fundamental units (for example, ''wavelengths'' in the older SI units and ''bohrs'' in [[atomic units]]) and are not defined by times of transit. Even in such units, however, the ''comparison'' of two lengths can be made by comparing the two transit times of light along the lengths. Such time-of-flight methodology may or may not be more accurate than the determination of a length as a multiple of the fundamental length unit.

'''Linguistic insecurity''' comprises feelings of [[anxiety]], [[self-consciousness]], or lack of [[confidence]] in the mind of a speaker surrounding the use of their own [[language]]. Often, this anxiety comes from speakers' [[belief]] that their use of language does not conform to the [[standard language|perceived standard]] and/or the style of language expected by the speakers' interlocutor(s). Linguistic insecurity is situationally induced and is often based on a feeling of inadequacy regarding personal [[linguistic performance|performance]] in certain contexts, rather than a fixed attribute of an individual. This insecurity can lead to stylistic, and [[phonetic]] shifts away from an affected speaker's default speech variety; these shifts may be performed [[consciousness|consciously]] on the part of the speaker, or may be reflective of an unconscious effort to conform to a more [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestigious]] or context-appropriate style of speech.&lt;ref name="bucci"&gt;Bucci, Wilma, and Milton Baxter. "Problems of Linguistic Insecurity in Multicultural Speech Contexts." Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 433.1 Discourses in (1984): 185-200. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistic insecurity is linked to the [[perception]] of speech styles in any [[community]], and so may vary based on [[socioeconomic class]]&lt;ref name="labov1964"&gt;Labov, William. "The Reflection of Social Processes in Linguistic Structure." Readings in the sociology of language. Ed. Joshua A. Fishman. Massachusetts: Mouton, 1972, Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gender]]. It is also especially pertinent in [[List of multilingual countries and regions|multilingual societies]].

==Description==
Linguistic insecurity is the negative self-image a speaker has regarding his or her own [[variety (linguistics)|speech variety]] or language as a whole, especially in the perceived difference between [[phonetic]] and [[syntactic]] characteristics of one's own speech and those characteristics of what is perceived to be the "correct" form of the spoken language.  Linguistic insecurity arises based on the [[perception]] of a lack of correctness regarding one's own speech, rather than any objective deficiencies in a particular speech variety.&lt;ref name="bucci"/&gt;

In one of its earliest usages, the term linguistic insecurity was employed by [[linguist]] [[William Labov]] in his 1972 paper on the [[social stratification]] of the pronunciation of /r/ to describe the attitude that employees, at three different retail stores in [[New York City|New York]], have towards their own speech patterns, in comparison to the [[Standard English]] form.&lt;ref name="Labov"&gt;Labov, William. Sociolinguistic Patterns. Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania, 1973. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Labov theorized that those employees who had the most extreme shift in style from their own speech variety (a casual style) to the standard form (a more emphatic style) were more insecure in a linguistic sense. The term has since been used to describe any situation in which a speaker is led to [[hypercorrection|hypercorrect]], or shift one's patterns of speech, due to a negative [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] or lack of [[confidence]] regarding one's normal speech. This lack of confidence need not be consciously acknowledged by a speaker in order for him/her to be affected by linguistic insecurity, and the changes in pronunciation and stylistic shifts indicative of linguistic insecurity can emerge absent of speaker intent.&lt;ref name="bucci" /&gt; Linguistic insecurity may also be a characteristic of an entire [[speech community]], especially in how it relates to other speech communities of the same language that employ a more standardized form.&lt;ref name="winnipeg"&gt;Owens, Thomposon W., and Paul M. Baker. "Linguistic Insecurity in Winnipeg: Validation of a Canadian Index of Linguistic Insecurity." Language in Society 13.03 (1984): 337-350. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard and prestige forms===
As linguistic insecurity is related to the perception of how one speaks in comparison to a certain form, the notion of standard and prestige forms of languages is important. The [[standard language|standard form]] of a language is regarded as the [[codification (linguistics)|codified]] form of language used in [[public discourse]],&lt;ref name="finnegan"&gt;Finegan, Edward. Language: Its Structure and Use, 5th ed. Boston, MA: Thomson Wadsworth, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] form is the one perceived to receive the most [[respect]] accorded to any variety of the language. Variables that differentiate standard and prestige forms include [[phonetics|phonetic realization]], [[vocabulary]], [[syntax]], among other features of speech. The status of these forms is related to the concept of [[language ideology]], which explains how varieties of language are correlated with certain moral, social or political values. Many societies value the belief that language homogeneity is beneficial to society; in fact, the existence of a "common language" is an intrinsic part of an [[imagined communities|imagined community]], which defines a [[nation]].&lt;ref name="andersen"&gt;Anderson, Benedict. Imagined communities: Reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism. Verso: London/New York, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RP vowel movement.png|thumb|300px|Vowels shifting in [[Received Pronunciation|RP]]. From {{Harvcoltxt|de Jong|McDougall|Hudson|Nolan|2007}}]]
However, the concept of a language [[norm (social)|norm]] is highly flexible. Nations often codify a [[standard language]] that may be different from regional norms. For example, Standard English in the [[United Kingdom]] is based on the south-eastern dialect and accent centered around London. In other parts of the UK, various dialects are spoken, such as [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[Geordie#Phonology|Geordie]]; even in London, there exist [[Cockney#Cockney speech|Cockney]] and [[Estuary English|Estuary]] accents. Studies of young people in [[Glasgow]] show that they self-report linguistic insecurity, describing their own speech as '[[slang]]' in comparison to the 'standard form' and attempting to incline their own speech to the standard.&lt;ref name="glasgow"&gt;Menzies, Janet. An investigation of attitudes to Scots and Glasgow dialect among secondary school pupils. n.d. Retrieved October 16, 2011, from http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/STELLA/STARN/lang/MENZIES/menzie1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Prestige forms may also demonstrate linguistic insecurity. Again, in the UK, [[Received Pronunciation|Received Pronunciation (RP)]], a prestige accent, has been affected by other varieties of speech. Though the standard form historically aimed towards RP, it is not a perfect imitation. The result is that RP speakers now demonstrate [[Received Pronunciation#Historical variation|changes in phonetic realization]] in the direction of the standard.&lt;ref name="RP"&gt;Liberman, Mark. Happy-tensing and coal in sex. Language Log, 2006. Retrieved October 14, 2011, from http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003859.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these shifts, a person using an RP accent would tend to give the impression that he or she is well-educated and part of a higher socioeconomic class. This is because these traits are often associated with RP speakers; they [[indexicality|index]] specific concepts that are presupposed by the community. Similarly, in general, forms of speech gain their status by their association with certain [[socioeconomic class|class]] characteristics. This [[indexicality]] does not need to be passive: in [[Beijing]], [[yuppie|young urban professionals]] actively adopt usages considered typical of prestigious [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]] speech in an effort to index themselves as cosmopolitan.&lt;ref name="eckert"&gt;Eckert, Penelope. Variation and the indexical field. ''Journal of Sociolinguistics'', 2008, 12: 453–476.&lt;/ref&gt; It also does not need to be positive: speech forms may also index negative characteristics. In his study of attitudes towards varieties of [[United States]] English, Preston demonstrates that people often associate the [[Southern American English|Southern accent]] with a lack of sophistication, indexing speakers with such an accent as being [[Cultural backwardness|backwards]] and [[conservative]]; and that Southern speakers themselves perceive their language to be inferior, exhibiting linguistic insecurity.&lt;ref name="myths"&gt;Preston, Dennis R. They speak really bad English down south and in New York City. In Language Myths, ed. Laurie Bauer and Peter Trudgill. London: Penguin, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
Speakers experiencing linguistic insecurity exhibit alterations of their normal speech which are reflective of their insecurity, and often are a result of the speaker attempting to compensate for the perceived deficiencies in their own speech variety. These effects of linguistic insecurity can come in the form of changes in pronunciation, as in the case of the retail store employees in William Labov's example, or even syntactic deviations from the speaker's normal speech variant.&lt;ref name="Labov"/&gt;

===Hypercorrection===
{{see|Hypercorrection}}
One documented linguistic effect of linguistic insecurity is [[hypercorrection]]. Hypercorrection is the over-application of a perceived rule of grammar in order to appear more formal or to appear to belong to a more prestigious speech community.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;Winford, Donald. "Phonological Hypercorrection in the Process of Decreolization – the Case of Trinidadian English." Journal of Linguistics 14.02 (1978): 277. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A common instance of hypercorrection in English is the use of the [[personal pronouns]] "you and I" as a correction of "me and you" in situations in which the [[accusative]] personal pronoun "me" is more appropriate.&lt;ref name="jacklynch"&gt;Lynch, Jack. The English Language: A User's Guide. Chicago: Focus/R. Pullins, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the use of "you and I" is internalized as the more grammatically sound form in the mind of many English speakers, that rule becomes over-applied in a situation when a speaker wants to compensate for perceived linguistic deficiencies.&lt;ref name=jacklynch /&gt; A speaker may try to avoid feelings of linguistic insecurity and perceived [[social stigma|stigmatization]] by projecting a more educated or formal identity and emulating what is perceived as a more prestigious speech variety. Inadvertently, hypercorrection may [[indexicality|index]] a speaker as belonging to the very social class or societal group that led to the linguistic insecurity. For example, linguist Donald Winford found after studying Trinidadian English that there was a knowledge that there was a stigmatization associated with less prestigious [[phonology|phonological]] variants, creating a situation in which individuals belonging to a "lower" social class would attempt to replicate phonological aspects of the more prestigious forms of English, but did not do so successfully, thus engaging in hypercorrection.&lt;ref name=jstor /&gt;

===Shifting registers===
{{see|Register (sociolinguistics)}}
Speakers experiencing linguistic insecurity may also undergo, either consciously or unconsciously, a change in register from their default language variety. [[Register (sociolinguistics)|Linguistic register]] refers to a variety of speech in a given language that corresponds to a specific situational purpose or social setting. An example of the [[phonology|phonological]] impact of register in [[English language|English]] is when speaking in a [[:wikt:formal|formal]] setting, it is customary to pronounce words ending in ''-ing'' with a [[velar nasal]] rather than substituting it for the [n] sound that is typical of ''-ing'' endings in [[Formal language|informal]] speech. A register shift cannot always be accounted for by documenting the individual phonological differences in speech from one's default speech variety to the newly registered speech variety, but instead may include a difference in the overall "tenor" of speech and in the way a speaker gives deference to his/her interlocutors who are more experienced in interacting in that register. Having to navigate in a linguistic register markedly different from one's own speech variety can be a catalyst for [[hypercorrection]] and other behavioral effects of linguistic insecurity that can further contribute to a sense of communicative inadequacy if the speaker feels he is not convincingly interacting in that linguistic register.&lt;ref name="Huspek"&gt;Huspek, Michael. "Linguistic Variation, Context, and Meaning: A Case of -Ing/in' Variation in North American Workers' Speech." Language in Society 15.2 (1986): 149-63. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==
===Social category===
====Socioeconomic class====
Findings show that the members of the [[lower middle class]] have the greatest tendency toward linguistic insecurity.  [[William Labov|Labov]] notes that evidence of their insecurity can be found in their wide range of stylistic variation, fluctuation in given stylistic contexts, conscious striving for correctness, and negative attitude towards their native speech pattern.
 
After conducting a linguistic survey in 1960s New York City, Labov found evidence that the usage of /r/ by speakers was predictable except in a specific case involving the lower middle class. At the time, the pronunciation of /r/ at the end of words and before consonants became a [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] marker and the degree to which it was realized in casual speech correlated with the [[socioeconomic status]] of the respondents. However, members of the lower middle class showed a dramatic increase of r-pronunciation when a more formal style of speech was elicited, even surpassing the usage by the classes above. Labov interpreted this tendency to hypercorrect by adopting the prestigious form of the high ranking class as a sign of the linguistic insecurity of the lower middle class.&lt;ref name=labov1964 /&gt;
 
Explanations for why the lower middle class exhibits this tendency have yet to be fully explored. A study conducted by Owens and Baker (1984)&lt;ref name="winnipeg" /&gt; shows that the lower middle class of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], Canada had highest scores for the CILI (Canadian Index of Linguistic Insecurity), which was adopted from Labov's original test – the ILI (Index of Linguistic Insecurity). In their paper, they hypothesize that this effect can be explained by an interaction between behavior and attitudes about [[social status]]. Members the lower middle class are caught between the linguistic behavior of the classes below them and the attitudes of the upper class. Members of the lower middle class accept the idea of correct speech from those above them, but changes in their usage lag behind changes in attitude. They identify the [[upper class]] usage as correct and admit that their behavior is different, leading to a disparity that manifests itself as linguistic insecurity.  Though Owens and Baker admit that a measure of the mobility aspirations of the respondents is needed to test their explanation, others agree that the effect can be best interpreted as a function of upward [[social mobility]] rather than of social class distinctions themselves.&lt;ref name="bucci" /&gt; In his later work, Labov highlights that it is often the second highest status groups that display the steepest slope of style shifting, most [[hypercorrection]], highest levels on linguistic insecurity tests, and the strongest tendency to [[stigmatize]] the speech of others in subjective evaluation tests for that variable. In many cases of socioeconomic stratification, this group is equated with the lower middle class.&lt;ref name="labov1991"&gt;Labov, William. "The Intersection of Sex and Social Class in the Course of Linguistic Change." Language Variation and Change 2.02 (1990). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender====
In the Owens and Baker study mentioned above, the authors used the CILI and ILI test to conclude that women are more linguistically insecure than men. Out of a sampling data of 80 participants, 42 of which were female, women scored higher on the ILI and the CILI, which indicates high manifest linguistic insecurity. On the CILI, the mean score was 3.23 for females and 2.10 for males. On the ILI, the means scores were 2.23 for females and 1.40 for males.  Though the t-tests for the differences were only significant at .07 and .06 levels, the authors feel that this was due to a small sample size and that the uniformity of the results was enough to confirm their hypothesis. Additionally, these findings are consistent with Labov's original New York study and lead to the conclusion by Owens and Baker that women display more linguistic insecurity than men.&lt;ref name="winnipeg" /&gt;

===Cross-linguistic contact===
====Dialect====
Linguistic insecurity can be heightened in [[speech communities]] in which multiple [[dialects]] exist beyond the [[standard language]]. Insecure speakers suffer from a negative attitude toward the speech of their dialect group and often feel pressured to mask their dialectal versatility since the norm of communication is to use the standard form. Bidialectal speakers, who speak both the standard and their own dialect, are most vulnerable to this problem because they are more aware of linguistic norms and the contexts to which they must adapt their speech to these norms. For monodialectal speakers, conversations can be difficult or stressful because they are locked into their nonstandard dialect and have a harder time explaining themselves in the standard dialect.&lt;ref name="bucci" /&gt;

=====African American Vernacular English=====
[[African American Vernacular English (AAVE)]] is a dialect of [[American English]] that is associated with the [[African American]] [[ethnic group]].  Speakers of AAVE (as well as speakers of other dialects found in the [[United States]]) have encountered a variety of sociolinguistic problems in many important institutions since [[General American|Standard American English (SAE)]] is the predominant form of English used.

One of these important institutions is [[school]]. Concerns about the academic achievement of African American children have motivated researchers to study the role AAVE plays though there are various explanations for how it might affect achievement. Dialectal differences could lead to inappropriate testing procedures or [[prejudice]] of educators (having lowered expectations&lt;ref name="reading"&gt;Charity, Anne H., Hollis S. Scarborough, and Darion M. Griffin. "Familiarity With School English in African American Children and Its Relation to Early Reading Achievement." Child Development 75.5 (2004): 1340-356. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and assuming the child is inarticulate and hesitant&lt;ref name="grillo"&gt;Grillo, R. D. Dominant Languages: Language and Hierarchy in Britain and France. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1989. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;). In this environment, AAVE-speaking students may develop linguistic insecurity, leading to a rejection of the standards as "posh" or reluctance to speak at all to hide their "inability" to use language.&lt;ref name="grillo" /&gt; AAVE-speaking students have also been shown to hypercorrect in attempts to speak or write in Standard English. Insecurity about what "sounds right" may result in the avoidance of the invariant ''be'' by deleting it from an instance in which it would be proper to use it (e.g. "They said they were told if they didn't follow orders they ''would courtmarshled'' or shot as deserters").&lt;ref name="writing"&gt;Whiteman, Marcia Farr. Variation in Writing: Functional and Linguistic-cultural Differences. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1981. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers of AAVE may also encounter problems in seeking treatment for [[mental disorder|mental health problems]], where professionals predominantly use Standard American English. Linguistic insecurity can be a cause of miscommunication for AAVE patients. For example, mental health care providers may attribute speaker's behavior to [[cognitive]] or emotional deficits, even to a [[psychopathological]] extent. In a study of a [[psychiatric ward]], Bucci and Baxter collected data on the impact of linguistic problems of the patients, which included several monodialectal speakers and bidialectal speakers of AAVE. In the case of "Jimmy", his background led his therapist to believe that his "muteness" resulted from [[emotional]] or [[neurophysiological]] problems. However, Bucci and Baxter found evidence indicating his position as a monodialectal AAVE speaker made him unwilling to speak. His linguistic insecurity in the clinical setting with a norm of SAE made him reluctant to speak, but he was fluent and expressive in his own speech community and with his descriptions of his experiences outside the ward. Moreover, standard therapeutic techniques may have a negative and opposite effect for linguistically insecure patient. In the case of the bidialectal "Arlene", the patient thought that her speech was an obstacle to communication because her therapist often asked her what she meant. The intervention of eliciting answers was meant to encourage Arlene to speak more freely, but her linguistic insecurity led her to focus her attention on the perceived inadequacy of her language style and she responded by saying less rather than more.&lt;ref name="bucci" /&gt;

=====Malinke-Bambara=====
One example of linguistic insecurity arising from dialectal differences can be found in work done by Canut and Keita (1994).&lt;ref name="canut"&gt;Canut, Cécile and Keita, Boniface. "Dynamique linguistique en zone mandingue : attitudes et comportements." ''Stratégies communicatives au Mali : langues régionales, bambara, français.'' Ed. G. Dumestre et al. Paris: Didier Erudition, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; They conducted a study of an area in the Mandingo zone of [[Mali]] that exhibited a [[linguistic continuum]] between two different forms: [[Bambara language|Bambara]] and [[Maninka language|Malinke]]. The study included two villages (Bendugu and [[Sagabari]]), a middle-sized town ([[Kita, Mali|Kita]]), and the capital of Mali ([[Bamako]]). Bamako is on the Bambara extreme of the continuum, Sagabari on the Malinke extreme, and Bendugu and Kita in between. The linguistic features important for understanding the differences between the dialects are mainly [[phonological]].

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
|-
! scope="col" width="70" | !! scope="col" width="100" | /c/ !! scope="col" width="100"  | /f/ !! scope="col" width="100" | /r/ (intervocalic) !! scope="col" width="100" | /k/
|-
| align="left" | Bamako || [c] || [f] || [r] || [k]
|-

|-
| align="left" | Bendugu || [k] || [h] || [d] || [x]
|-
| align="left" | Sagabari || [k] || [h] || [t] || [x]
|}

The area encompassing these four places has relatively high [[social mobility]] and those who gain status often move towards Bamako, the capital. The dialects follow this pattern, as those closer to the capital are perceived as more prestigious; the most peripheral form in Sagabari can even prompt mockery of the individual using it. Thus, those speaking a dialect different from Bambara are likely to be affected by linguistic insecurity, particularly those closer to the Malinke end of the continuum.
 
Since [[Human migration|migration]] is common, there are many examples of young migrants to the area who display linguistic insecurity. Most migrants who speak Malinke try to hide their origins and assimilate to the higher status society by changing the way that they speak. In their attempts to escape their geosocial status, however, they tend to [[hypercorrect]] to the point where they create non-existent terms in Bambara.  One example is replacing every /h/ in Malinke with the /f/ used in Bamako, leading one to say 'young boy' /foron/ (which does not exist in Bamako) for 'noble' /horon/.&lt;ref name="calvet"&gt;Calvet, Louis-Jean. Towards an Ecology of World Languages. Oxford: Blackwell, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Creole languages====
{{see|Creole language}}
Linguistic insecurity in relation to [[Creole language|creoles]] has to do with the underlying assumption and classification of these languages as inferior forms of the parent languages from which they are derived. Typical of most non-official languages, creoles are regarded as mere degenerate variants and rudimentary dialects that are subsumed under the main [[standard language|"standard" languages]] for that particular community. With this popular view, creoles are thought to be impoverished, primitive outputs that are far from their European target languages. The negative nonlinguistic implications lead to claims of creole use as being a "handicap" for their speakers. This has caused speakers of these creole languages to experience insecurity and lack of confidence in the use of their form of language, which has undermined the prevalence of creoles spoken in societies.&lt;ref name="degraff"&gt;Degraff, Michel. "Linguists' most dangerous myth: The fallacy of Creole Exceptionalism." Language in Society. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation concerning the different attitudes of speakers is that some populations are more insistent of the use of their particular form of language, as it is commonly claimed to be more "pure." This assumption places this form as a more prestigious standard, creating a tense environment that promotes feelings of insecurity to those who do not follow this standard (and speak "impure" variations).&lt;ref name="whinnom"&gt;Whinnom, Keith. "Linguistic Hybridization and the "Special Case" of Pidgins and Creoles."Pidginization and Creolization of Languages. (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

An instance of linguistic insecurity can be found in relation to [[Haitian Creole]], which developed from a combination of [[French language|French]] and other languages. Although the vast majority in this country grows up hearing and speaking exclusively this creole, it continues to be seen as an inferior, primitive tongue as well as a malformed version of French. This disfavor against the creole, which exists throughout the society, is present even among those who can speak only in that variation. The cause of the view has been attributed to the association of French with prestige, as most of the island's land-owning, well-educated elite speaks this language. These judgments contribute to the widespread belief that success is linked to French and that one must speak French to become part of the middle class with a financially stable job, a notion that places Haitian Creole on a lower status. Though it is the majority of people who cannot participate in the French-driven areas of society, the "ideology of disrespect and degradation" surrounding creoles leads to great linguistic insecurity. As Arthur Spears put it, an "internalized oppression" is present in these members who relate important figures in society (and their success) to speaking French, devaluing their own language of Haitian Creole.&lt;ref name="degraff2"&gt;Degraff, Michel. "The Power of Creole."Article Collections, Boston.com. (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multilingual societies====
Linguistic insecurity can arise in [[multilingual]] environments in speakers of the non-dominant language or of a non-standard dialect. Issues caused by the linguistic variation range from "total communication breakdowns involving foreign language speakers to subtle difficulties involving bilingual and bidialectal speakers".&lt;ref name=bucci /&gt; Divergence from the standard variety by minority languages causes "a range of attitudinal issues surrounding the status of minority languages as a standard linguistic variety".&lt;ref name="oakes"&gt;Oakes, Leigh. "Whose French? Language Attitudes, Linguistic Insecurity and Standardization in Quebec." Language issues in Canada: multidisciplinary perspectives. Newcastle, UK: Cambridge Scholars Pub., 2007. 64-86. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Quebec French=====
An example of mother-tongue-based linguistic insecurity in a multilingual environment is [[Quebec French]]. Due to a general perception of Quebec French as lacking in quality and diverging from the norm, French speaking Quebeckers have suffered from a sense of linguistic insecurity. Though French is widely spoken in [[Quebec]], the French in France is considered by many to be the standard and prestigious form. This comparison and the fact that Quebec French diverges from the standard form of France have caused linguistic insecurity among Quebec speakers.

Due to the separation from France after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763 and the multilingual environment, Quebec French become more anglicized through English pronunciations and borrowings. Though French Canadian speakers were aware of the differences between Quebec French and [[French language|French]], the foreign perception of Quebec French as "non-standard" was not an issue until the mid 19th century. The opinions of the French elite that Quebec French was "far removed from the prestigious variety spoken in Paris" had spread through the general public by the end of the 19th century, causing a deep sense of linguistic insecurity in French speaking Quebec. The insecurity was twofold since Quebeckers spoke neither the dominant English language nor, as they were being told, Standard French.&lt;ref name="oakes"/&gt;

A '''longitudinal study''' (or '''longitudinal survey''', or '''panel study''') is a [[research design]] that involves repeated observations of the same variables (e.g., people) over short or long periods of time (i.e., uses [[longitudinal data]]). It is often a type of [[observational study]], although they can also be structured as longitudinal [[randomized experiment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shadish|first1=William R.|last2=Cook|first2=Thomas D.|last3=Campbell|first3=Donald T.|title=Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Generalized Causal Inference|date=2002|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston|isbn=0-395-61556-9|page=267|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longitudinal studies are often used in social-personality and [[clinical psychology]], to study rapid fluctuations in behaviors, thoughts, and emotions from moment to moment or day to day; in [[developmental psychology]], to study developmental trends across the life span; and in [[sociology]], to study life events throughout lifetimes or generations. The reason for this is that, unlike [[cross-sectional study|cross-sectional studies]], in which different individuals with the same characteristics are compared,&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Neil and et al. "Psychology the Science of Behavior", p. 361. Pearson Canada, United States of America&lt;/ref&gt; longitudinal studies track the same people, and so the differences observed in those people are less likely to be the result of cultural differences across generations. Longitudinal studies thus make observing changes more accurate and are applied in various other fields. In medicine, the design is used to uncover predictors of certain diseases. In advertising, the design is used to identify the changes that advertising has produced in the attitudes and behaviors of those within the target audience who have seen the advertising campaign. Longitudinal studies allow [[social scientists]] to distinguish short from long-term phenomena, such as [[poverty]]. If the poverty rate is 10% at a point in time, this may mean that 10% of the population are always poor or that the whole population experiences poverty for 10% of the time. It is impossible to conclude which of these possibilities is the case by using one-off cross-sectional studies.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

When longitudinal studies are [[observational study|observational]], in the sense that they observe the state of the world without manipulating it, it has been argued that they may have less power to detect [[causality|causal relationships]] than [[experiment]]s. However, because of the repeated observation at the individual level, they have more power than cross-sectional observational studies, by virtue of being able to exclude time-invariant unobserved individual differences and also of observing the temporal order of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= van der Krieke, L., Blaauw, F.J., Emerencia, A.C., Schenk, H.M., Slaets, J., Bos, E.H., de Jonge, P., Jeronimus, B.F.| year = 2016 | title = Temporal Dynamics of Health and Well-Being: A Crowdsourcing Approach to Momentary Assessments and Automated Generation of Personalized Feedback | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000000378 |doi=10.1097/PSY.0000000000000378 | pmid=27551988 | pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the disadvantages of longitudinal study are that they take a lot of time and are very expensive. Therefore, they are not very convenient.&lt;ref name="Longitudinal study"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=What Is Longitudinal Research?|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/lindex/g/longitudinal.htm|work=experiments|publisher=About.com guide|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longitudinal studies can be [[Retrospective study|retrospective]] (looking back in time, thus using existing data such as medical records or claims database) or [[Prospective study|prospective]] (requiring the collection of new data).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[cohort study|Cohort studies]] are one type of longitudinal study which sample a [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] (a group of people who share a defining characteristic, typically who experienced a common event in a selected period, such as birth or graduation) and perform [[Cross-sectional data|cross-section]] observations at intervals through time. However, not all longitudinal studies are cohort studies, as longitudinal studies can instead include a group of people who do not share a common event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/54017/what-is-the-difference-between-a-panel-study-and-a-cohort-study|title=What is the difference between a Panel Study and a Cohort Study?|website=Academia Stack Exchange|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|The 45 and Up Study is a longitudinal study of participants aged 45 years and over in New South Wales conducted by the [https://www.saxinstitute.org.au/ Sax Institute]. Researchers are able to analyse Study data linked to [http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/internet/mbsonline/publishing.nsf/Content/Home MBS] and [http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/Pharmaceutical+Benefits+Scheme+%28PBS%29-1 PBS] data, the NSW cancer registry, State hospitalisations and emergency department visits and mortality data.
The Study is used by both researchers and policy makers to better understand how Australians are ageing and using health services to prevent and manage ill-health and disability and guide health system decisions. 45 and Up is the largest ongoing study of healthy ageing in the Southern Hemisphere.

|England and Wales
|1974 (data from 1971)
|1% sample of the population of England and Wales. The LS contains records on over 500,000 people usually resident in England and Wales at each point in time
|The sample comprises people born on one of four selected dates of birth and therefore makes up about 1% of the total population. The sample was initiated at the time of the 1971 Census, and the four dates were used to update the sample at the 1981,1991 2001 and 2011 Censuses and in routine event registrations. Fresh LS members enter the study through birth and immigration and existing members leave through death and emigration.
Thus, the LS represents a continuous sample of the population of England and Wales, rather than a sample taken at one time point only. It now includes records for over 950,000 study members.

In addition to the census records, the individual LS records contain data for events such as deaths, births to sample mothers, emigrations and cancer registrations.

Census information is also included for all people living in the same household as the LS member. However, it is important to emphasise that the LS does not follow up household members in the same way from census to census.

|Scotland
|1991
|The Scottish Longitudinal Study comprises 5.3% sample of the Scottish population, holds records on approximately 274,000 individuals using 20 random birthdates.
| The SLS is a large-scale linkage study built upon census records from 1991 onwards, with links to vital events (births, deaths, marriages, emigration); geographical and ecological data (deprivation indices, pollution, weather); primary and secondary education data (attendance, Schools Census, qualifications); and links to NHS Scotland ISD datasets, including cancer registrations, maternity records, hospital admissions, prescribing data and mental health admissions. The research potential is considerable. The SLS is a replica of the ONS Longitudinal Study but with a few key differences: sample size, commencement point and the inclusion of certain variables.
The SLS is supported and maintained by the SLS Development &amp; Support Unit with a safe-setting at the National Records of Scotland in Edinburgh.

| Panel 
| Northern Ireland
| 2006 
| The Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study comprises about 28% of the Northern Ireland population (approximately 500,000 individuals and approximately 50% of households).
| The NILS is a large-scale, representative data-linkage study created by linking data from the Northern Ireland Health Card Registration system to the 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011 census returns and to administrative data from other sources. These include vital events registered with the General Register Office for Northern Ireland (such as births, deaths and marriages) and the Health Card registration system migration events data. The result is a 30-year-plus longitudinal data set which is regularly being updated. In addition to this rich resource there is also the potential to link further Health and Social care data via distinct linkage projects (DLPs).
The NILS is designed for statistics and research purposes only and is managed by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency under Census legislation. The data are de-identified at the point of use; access is only from within a strictly controlled ‘secure environment’ and governed by protocols and procedures to ensure data confidentiality.

{{Mind-body interventions}}
A '''medical intuitive''' is an [[alternative medicine]] practitioner who claims to use their self-described intuitive abilities to find the cause of a physical or emotional condition through the use of insight rather than [[modern medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carroll |first1=Robert Todd |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll|title=intuitive healer |url=http://skepdic.com/intuitivehealer.html |website=skepdic.com |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms for such a person include '''medical clairvoyant''', '''medical psychic''', '''intuitive counselor''' or '''fraud'''.&lt;ref name=howes2009/&gt;

==History==
The practice of claiming to use [[intuition]] or [[clairvoyance]] for medical information dates back to [[Phineas Parkhurst Quimby]] (1802–1866), whose intuitive healing practice began in 1854. [[Edgar Cayce]] (1877–1945) was known as one of the most well known medical clairvoyants.&lt;ref name="Randi"/&gt; [[William M. Branham]], the father of the Pentecostal [[Latter Rain (post-World War II movement)|Latter Rain Movement]], was said by his followers to be able to discern the health condition of people that attended his services, and in many cases heal them of their affliction.&lt;ref name="Riss"&gt;{{cite book| last = Riss | first = Richard | year = 1988 | title = A Survey of 20th Century Revival Movements in North America | publisher = Hendrickson Publishers | isbn = 0-913573-72-8 |pages= 105–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Making a formal [[medical diagnosis]] is not a practice for many medical intuitives, but some medical intuitives also work with M.D.s or N.D.s including some general practitioners who have called on medical intuitives for second opinions.&lt;ref name="Body"/&gt;&lt;ref name=act6_6_331/&gt; In a few cases medical intuitives have been hired by  hospitals, clinics and medical offices, particularly in California.&lt;ref name="Body"/&gt; Many medical professionals and psychologists attribute perceived anecdotal successes by medical intuitives to a combination of wishful thinking, [[confirmation bias]], the [[placebo effect]], and [[regression fallacy]] associated with self-limiting conditions.&lt;ref name=pt6_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sram3_2/&gt;

A few educational institutions offer graduate degrees that include "research-based training" and certifications for medical intuitives.&lt;ref name="Body"&gt;{{citation |title= Body of Health: the new science of intuition medicine for energy &amp; balance |first= Francesca |last= McCartney |page= 23m |publisher= New World Library |year= 2005 |postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other medical intuitives may be licensed medical professionals and their ability to accurately diagnose diseases and heal may not be supported by scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="Randi"&gt;{{cite book| last = Randi | first = James | authorlink = James Randi | year = 1989 | title = [[The Faith Healers]] | publisher = Prometheus Books | isbn = 0-87975-535-0| page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Soul Medicine |first1= Norman |last1= Sheally |first2= Dawson |last2= Church |year= 2006 |publisher= Elite Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= David E. |last1= Young |first2= Steven K. H. |last2= Aung |title= An experimental test of psychic diagnosis of disease |journal= The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine |year= 1997 |volume= 3 |issue= 1 |pages= 39–53 |doi= 10.1089/acm.1997.3.39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A published study on medical intuitives said that "patients relying solely on psychic diagnosis as the basis for therapy are at risk of serious medical problems going undetected".&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt;

In 2009 [[Steven Novella]], writing on [[Science Based Medicine]], calls medical intuitive diagnosis as "purely magical thinking" and refers to a [[Huffington Post]] article about it as "a promotion of a dubious pseudoscientific medical claim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Novella |first1=Steven |authorlink=Steven Novella|title=Pseudoscience In Medical News at the Huffington Post |url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/pseudoscience-in-medical-news-at-the-huffington-post/ |website=sciencebasedmedicine.org |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structured after the concept of [[creative participation]] ''Muringa Vila'' integrates vital interests of its [[cultural creative]] participants as well as environmental and spiritual aspects, providing housing and income through self-created business as well as pursuing a [[sustainable]] local infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;V.Dahlheimer: [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cultural_Anthropology Towards a Future in Cultural Anthropology], 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was founded by a local fisherman and a German ethnologist in 2005 with the goal of finding practical solutions for problems of the indigenous society of this particular place which are created by a changing global environment, i.e. depleted oceans (as a source of income for the fishermen), [[gentrification]] of the village, emigration, educational deficits, immediate environmental threads, the take over of the beaches by tourism.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Drechsel: [http://drechsel-science.de/webseiten/globalisierung.htm Logik der Globalisierung], Mainz, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nitratine''' or '''nitratite''', also known as ''cubic [[niter]]'' (UK: ''nitre''), ''soda niter'' or ''Chile saltpeter'' (UK: ''Chile saltpetre''), is a mineral, the naturally occurring form of [[sodium nitrate]], NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Chemically it is the sodium analogue of [[saltpeter]]. Nitratine crystallizes in the [[Rhombohedral crystal system|trigonal]] system, but rarely occurs as well formed crystals. It is isostructural with [[calcite]]. It is quite soft and light with a [[Mohs hardness]] of 1.5 to 2 and a [[specific gravity]] of 2.24 to 2.29. Its [[refractive index|refractive indices]] are nω=1.587 and nε=1.336.&lt;ref&gt;Nesse, W, introduction to Optical Mineralogy, Fourth Edition (Oxford, New York, Oxford University Press) 2013. appendix II, B.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical form is as coatings of white, grey to yellowish brown masses. The rare crystals when found typically have the [[:wikt:scalenohedral|scalenohedral]] form of the [[calcite]] structure. It is found only as an efflorescence in very dry environments. It is very soluble in water such that it is [[deliquescent]] and will absorb water out of the air and turn into a ''puddle'' of sodium nitrate solution when exposed to humid air. 

Nitratine was once an important source of nitrates for fertilizer and other chemical uses including [[fireworks]]. It has been known since 1845 from occurrences in the [[Confidence Hills]], Southern [[Death Valley]], [[California]] and the [[Atacama Desert]], [[Chile]]. It is still used in [[organic farming]] (where [[Haber–Bosch process|Haber-Bosch ammonia]] is forbidden) in the US, but prohibited in international organic agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Omnivores Dilemma]]'' - [[Michael Pollan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Circulation of Ocean Currents Around the Western Antarctic Ice Shelves.ogv|thumb|Animation of circulation around ice shelves of [[Antarctica]].]]
An '''ocean current''' is a continuous, directed movement of [[sea water]] generated by a number forces acting upon the water, including [[wind]], the [[Coriolis effect]], [[wave breaking|breaking waves]], [[cabbeling]], and [[temperature]] and [[salinity]] differences. [[Depth contour]]s, [[shore]]line configurations, and interactions with other currents influence a current's direction and strength. Ocean currents are primarily horizontal water movements.

Ocean currents flow for great distances, and together, create the [[global conveyor belt]] which plays a dominant role in determining the [[climate]] of many of the [[Earth]]’s regions.  More specifically, ocean currents influence the temperature of the regions through which they travel.  For example, warm currents traveling along more temperate coasts increase the temperature of the area by warming the sea breezes that blow over them.  Perhaps the most striking example is the [[Gulf Stream]], which makes [[northwest Europe]] much more [[temperate]] than any other region at the same [[latitude]]. Another example is [[Lima, Peru]], where the climate is cooler, being sub-tropical, than the tropical latitudes in which the area is located, due to the effect of the [[Humboldt Current]]. 

== Function ==
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 11128 The bathymetry of the Kerguelen Plateau in the Southern Ocean governs the course of the new current part of the global network of ocean currents.jpg|thumb|right|The [[bathymetry]] of the [[Kerguelen Plateau]] in the [[Southern Ocean]] governs the course of the new current part of the global network of ocean currents (Source:[[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]])]]

Surface oceanic currents are sometimes wind driven and develop their typical clockwise spirals in the [[northern hemisphere]] and counter-clockwise rotation in the [[southern hemisphere]] due to imposed wind stresses. In these wind-driven currents, the [[Ekman spiral]] effect results in the currents flowing at an angle to the driving winds. In addition, the areas of surface ocean currents move somewhat with the [[season]]s; this is most notable in equatorial currents.

Deep ocean basins generally have a non-symmetric surface current, in that the eastern equatorward-flowing branch is broad and diffuse whereas the western poleward flowing branch is very narrow. These [[Boundary current|western boundary currents]] (of which the [[Gulf Stream]] is an example) are a consequence of the rotation of the Earth.

Deep ocean currents are driven by density and temperature gradients. [[Thermohaline circulation]] is also known as the ocean's conveyor belt (which refers to deep ocean density-driven [[ocean basin]] currents). These currents, called submarine rivers, flow under the surface of the ocean and are hidden from immediate detection. Where significant vertical movement of ocean currents is observed, this is known as [[upwelling]] and [[downwelling]].  Deep ocean currents are currently being researched using a fleet of underwater robots called [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo]].

Surface currents make up only 8% of all water in the ocean, are generally restricted to the upper {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} of ocean water, and are separated from lower regions by varying temperatures and salinity which affect the density of the water, which in turn, defines each oceanic region. Because the movement of deep water in ocean basins is caused by density-driven forces and gravity, deep waters sink into deep ocean basins at high latitudes where the temperatures are cold enough to cause the density to increase.

Ocean currents are measured in [[Sverdrup|sverdrup (sv)]], where 1 sv is equivalent to a volume flow rate of {{convert|1000000|m3|ft3|abbr=on}} per second.

Surface currents are found on the surface of an ocean, and are driven by large scale wind currents. They are directly affected by the wind{{mdash}}the [[Coriolis effect]] plays a role in their behaviours.&lt;ref name=NNOAACurrents&gt;

==Thermohaline circulation==
{{Further|Deep ocean water|Thermohaline circulation}}

The thermohaline circulation is a part of the large-scale ocean circulation that is driven by global [[density gradient]]s created by surface heat and freshwater [[flux]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rahmstorf|first=S|title=The concept of the thermohaline circulation|journal=Nature|volume=421|page=699|year=2003|url=http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/Publications/Nature/nature_concept_03.pdf|pmid=12610602|issue=6924|doi=10.1038/421699a|bibcode = 2003Natur.421..699R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lappo|first=SS|title=On reason of the northward heat advection across the Equator in the South Pacific and Atlantic ocean|journal=Study of Ocean and Atmosphere Interaction Processes|year=1984|pages=125–9|publisher=Moscow Department of Gidrometeoizdat (in Mandarin)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective ''thermohaline'' derives from ''[[wikt:thermo-|thermo-]]'' referring to [[temperature]] and ''{{nowrap|-haline}}'' referring to [[salinity|salt content]], factors which together determine the [[Water (molecule)#Density of saltwater and ice|density of sea water]]. [[Wind]]-driven surface currents (such as the [[Gulf Stream]]) travel [[Polar regions of Earth|polewards]] from the equatorial [[Atlantic Ocean]], cooling en route, and eventually sinking at high [[latitude]]s (forming [[North Atlantic Deep Water]]). This dense water then flows into the [[ocean basin]]s. While the bulk of it [[upwelling|upwells]] in the [[Southern Ocean]], the oldest waters (with a transit time of around 1000 years)&lt;ref&gt;The global ocean conveyor belt is a constantly moving system of deep-ocean circulation driven by temperature and salinity; [http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/conveyor.html What is the global ocean conveyor belt?]&lt;/ref&gt; upwell in the North Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/JPO2699.1|last=Primeau|first=F|title=Characterizing transport between the surface mixed layer and the ocean interior with a forward and adjoint global ocean transport model|journal=Journal of Physical Oceanography|volume=35|issue=4|pages=545–64|year=2005|bibcode=2005JPO....35..545P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive mixing therefore takes place between the ocean basins, reducing differences between them and making the Earth's oceans a global system. On their journey, the water masses transport both energy (in the form of heat) and matter (solids, dissolved substances and gases) around the globe. As such, the state of the circulation has a large impact on the [[climate]] of the Earth. The thermohaline circulation is sometimes called the ocean conveyor belt, the great ocean conveyor, or the global conveyor belt. On occasion, it is imprecisely used to refer to the [[Zonal and meridional|meridional]] overturning circulation, ''MOC''.

The Meddies are shown in red in this scientific figure.]]

== Importance ==
[[Image:Ocean currents 1943 (borderless)3.png|thumb|right|250px|A 1943 map of the world's ocean currents.]]

Knowledge of  surface ocean currents is essential in reducing costs of shipping, since traveling with them reduces fuel costs. In the wind powered sailing-ship era, knowledge of wind patterns and ocean currents was even more essential. A good example of this is the [[Agulhas Current]] (down along eastern Africa), which long prevented Portuguese sailors from reaching India. In recent times, around-the-world sailing competitors make good use of surface currents to build and maintain speed. Ocean currents are also very important in the dispersal of many life forms. An example is the [[Eel life history|life-cycle of the European Eel]].

Ocean currents are important in the study of [[marine debris]], and vice versa. These currents also affect temperatures throughout the world. For example, the ocean current that brings warm water up the north Atlantic to northwest Europe also cumulatively and slowly blocks ice from forming along the seashores, which would also block ships from entering and exiting inland waterways and seaports, hence ocean currents play a decisive role in influencing the climates of regions through which they flow. Cold ocean water currents flowing from polar and sub-polar regions bring in a lot of [[plankton]] that are crucial to the continued survival of several key sea creature species in [[marine ecosystem]]s. Since plankton are the food of fish, abundant fish populations often live where these currents prevail.

Ocean currents can also be used for [[Marine current power|marine power generation]], with areas off of Japan, Florida and Hawaii being considered for test projects.

== OSCAR: Near-realtime global ocean surface current data set ==

The [https://www.esr.org/research/oscar/ OSCAR Near-realtime global ocean surface currents] website describes the project and links to data validation and data downloads.

OSCAR data is used extensively in climate studies. maps and descriptions or annotations of climatic anomalies have been published in the monthly [http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/CDB/ Climate Diagnostic Bulletin] since 2001 and are routinely used to monitor [[ENSO]] and to test weather prediction models. OSCAR currents are routinely used to evaluate the surface currents in [[Global Circulation Model]]s (GCMs), for example in NCEP Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (GODAS) and [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts]] (ECMWF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Reginald Walter Hooley''' (5 September 1865 – 5 May 1923&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary Mr. R. W. Hooley", ''Nature'' '''111''': 817-817 (16 June 1923) {{doi|10.1038/111817b0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a businessman and amateur [[paleontologist]], collecting on the [[Isle of Wight]].

==Isle of Wight==
Regular visits to the island resulted in the find of hundreds of fossils among which several major specimens on which he, from 1900, published fourteen scientific papers. He described remains of many [[turtle]]s, and named the [[dinosaur]] ''[[Iguanodon atherfieldensis]]''&lt;ref name=RWH25&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hooley |first=R. W. |year=1925|title=On the skeleton of ''Iguanodon atherfieldensis'' sp. nov., from the Wealden Shales of Atherfield (Isle of Wight) |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=1–61 |issn=0370-291X |doi=10.1144/GSL.JGS.1925.081.01-04.02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[pterosaur]] ''[[Ornithodesmus latidens]]''. Hooley was a member of the [[Hampshire Field Club &amp; Archaeological Society]] at [[Winchester]] from 1890. He was one of the founders of the [[Isle of Wight Natural History and Archaeological Society]]. He was an honorary [[curator]] of the [[Winchester Museum]] between 1918 and 1923.

==Career==
Reginald was born in [[Southampton]], the son of William Hooley, a wealthy [[gentleman]]. In 1889 R.W. Hooley began to work for ''Godrich &amp; Petman'', wine merchants, and later in life became managing director of that firm. Living in [[Portswood]], in 1912 he married E.E. Holden and moved to Winchester. In 1913 he was elected a member of the Winchester city council. Hooley made his most famous finds in 1889 and 1914 when two iguanodontid skeletons were exposed by erosion at the cliffs. In 1904 the remains of "Ornithodesmus" were uncovered by a cliff fall. After Hooley's death, the paper naming ''Iguanodon atherfieldensis'' was posthumously published and most of the ''Hooley Collection'', over 1330 specimens, was, in 1924. acquired by the [[British Museum of Natural History]] which displays the iguanodontid skeletons in the Dinosaur Hall.&lt;ref&gt;T.A. Getty &amp; M.D. Crane, 1975, "An Historical Account of the Palaeontological Collections found by R. W. Hooley (1865-1923)", ''Newsletter of the Geological Curators Group'', '''4''' (September 1975): 170-179&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 the extinct plant ''[[Hooleya]]'' was named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18219">'''Scanning Joule Expansion Microscopy''' is a form of [[scanning probe microscopy]] heavily based on [[atomic force microscopy]] that maps the temperature distribution along a surface. Resolutions down to 10&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] have been achieved&lt;ref name="Gurrum"/&gt; and 1&amp;nbsp;nm resolution is theoretically possible. Thermal measurements at the nanometer scale are of both academic and industrial interest, particularly in regards to [[nanomaterials]] and modern [[integrated circuits]].

==Basic Principles==
[[File:SJEM schematic.png|thumb|400 px|right|Simplified schematic of Scanning Joule expansion microscope.]]
Scanning Joule Expansion Microscopy (SJEM) is based on the contact operation model of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). During the operation, the tip on the cantilever is brought into contact with the surface of the sample. AC or pulsed electrical signal is applied to the sample creating Joule heating and resulting in periodic thermal expansion.&lt;ref name="Varesi"&gt;J. Varesi, A. Majumdar, "Scanning Joule Expansion Microscopy at nanometer scales", ''Applied Physics Letters'', 72, 37 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the laser, which is focused on the top surface of the cantilever and the photodiode of the equipment, detects the displacement of the cantilever. The detecting photodiode is composed of two segments, which normalizes the incoming signal deflected from the cantilever. This differential signal is proportional to the cantilever deflection.&lt;ref name="Majumdar"&gt;A. Majumdar, and J.Varesi, “Nanoscale Temperature Distributions Measured by Scanning Joule Expansion Microscopy,” ''Journal of Heat Transfer'', 120, 297 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The deflection signals are caused not only by sample topography, but also by the thermal expansion caused by Joule heating. Since AFM has feedback controller with a bandwidth, for example 20&amp;nbsp;kHz (different AFM may have different bandwidths), the signal below 20&amp;nbsp;kHz is captured and processed by the feedback controller which then adjusts the z-piezo to image surface topography. Joule heating frequency is kept well above 20&amp;nbsp;kHz to avoid feedback response and to separate topological and thermal effects. The upper limit of the frequency is limited by the decrease of thermoelastic expansion with the inverse power of the modulation frequency and the frequency characteristics of the cantilever arrangement.&lt;ref name="Bolte"&gt;J. Bolte, F. Niebisch, J. Pelzl, P. Stelmaszyk, and A.D. Wieck, “Study of the hot spot of an in-plane gate transistor by scanning Joule Expansion Microscopy,” ''Journal of Applied Physics'', 84, 6917 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; A lock-in amplifier is specially tuned to the Joule heating frequency for detecting only the expansion signal and provides the information to an auxiliary Atomic Force Microscopy channel to create the thermal expansion image. Usually expansion signals approximately 0.1 Angstroms start to be detected, although the resolution of SJEM highly depends on the whole system (cantilever, sample surface, etc.).

By comparison, Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has coaxial thermocouple at the end of sharp metal tip. The spatial resolution of SThM critically depends on the thermocouple sensor size. Much effort has been dedicated to reducing sensor size to sub-micrometre scales. The quality and resolution of the images are very dependent on the nature of the thermal contact between tip and the sample; hence it is quite difficult to control in a reproducible way. The fabrication also becomes very challenging particularly for thermocouple sensor size below 500&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Varesi"/&gt; With optimization on the design and the fabrication, it was possible to achieve resolution around 25&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Majumdar"/&gt; Scanning Joule Expansion Microscopy, however, has the potential of achieving similar to AFM resolution of 1~10&amp;nbsp;nm. In practice, however, the spatial resolution is limited to the size of the liquid film bridge between the tip and the sample, which is typically about 20&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Varesi"/&gt; The microfabricated thermocouples used for Scanning Thermal Microscopy are rather expensive and more importantly very fragile. Scanning Joule Expansion Microscopy has been used to measure the local heat dissipation of an in-plane gate (IPG) transistor to study hot spots in semiconductor devices,&lt;ref name="Bolte"/&gt; and thin-film alloy like cobalt-nickel silicide.&lt;ref name="Cannaerts"&gt;M. Cannaerts, O. Chamirian, K. Maex, and C. V. Haesendonck, ''Nanotechnology''. 13, 149 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signal acquisition and analysis==
Signal obtained by the AFM (and captured by lock-in amplifier) are actually representations of the cantilever deflection at a specific frequency. However, besides thermal expansion, several other sources may also result in cantilever deflection.

===Thermally induced cantilever bending===

This is usually due to the mismatch in thermal expansion of two cantilever materials, for instance, silicon cantilever coated with a thin layer of metal (to increase the deflection). When heated, materials with higher expansion coefficient will expand more than the material with lower expansion coefficient. In this case, two materials, one in tensile strain, the other in compression strain, will induce substantial bending. However, this mechanism can be excluded for two reasons; first, cantilever coatings have been stripped experimentally and no change in signal was observed; second, the calculated thermal diffusion length in SiNx and Si cantilevers at the SJEM working frequency (typically 10&amp;nbsp;kHz~100&amp;nbsp;kHz) is small, much smaller than the length of the cantilever(typically 100&amp;nbsp;um).&lt;ref name="Varesi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Varesi thesis"&gt;John B. Varesi, “Development and Implementation of Scanning Joule Expansion Microscopy”. MS thesis, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pressure waves===

When the sample heats and contracts due to rapid Joule heating from an applied AC power source, pressure waves may be radiated from the sample. This wave may interact with the cantilever, causing additional deflection. However, this possibility is unlikely. For sinusoidal heating, the wavelength of the acoustic wave in air with speed of 340&amp;nbsp;m/s is about several millimeters, which is much larger than the length of cantilever. Furthermore, experiments have been carried out under vacuum, in which case there are no air pressure waves. In the experiment, it was observed that when the cantilever was out of contact with sample surface, no deflection signal was detected.&lt;ref name="Varesi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Varesi thesis"/&gt;

===Piezoelectric effect===

In piezoelectric materials, mechanical expansion occurs due to applied bias. Therefore, if the sample is such a material, an additional piezoelectric effect must be considered when analyzing the signal. Typically, piezoelectric expansion is linearly dependent on applied voltage and a simple subtraction can be used to correct for this effect.

===Electrostatic force interaction===

When a bias is applied to the sample for Joule heating, there is also an electrostatic force interaction between the tip and the sample. The tip-sample electrostatic force can be represented as &lt;math&gt;F{{=}}\frac{1}{2}{\operatorname{d}C\over\operatorname{d}z}V^2&lt;/math&gt;, in which C is the tip sample capacitance, and V is the voltage, Z is the tip and sample distance. This force also depends on &lt;math&gt;V^2&lt;/math&gt;, the same as the expansion signal. Usually electrostatic force is small because the sample has been covered with a polymer layer. However, when applied voltage is large, this force needs to be considered. Electrostatic force does not depend on the frequency of the applied AC signal, therefore allowing for a simple method to differentiate and account for this contribution.&lt;ref name="Varesi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Varesi thesis"/&gt;

===Thermal expansion===

This is primary mode of signal and the main goal of SJEM. The substrate expands when Joule heated, resulting in change in the measured profile by the cantilever, resulting in a change in signal. However, thermal expansion coefficients can vary significantly. For example, the thermal expansion coefficients of metal are typically one order of magnitude higher than those of dielectric and amorphous materials; while the expansion coefficient of polymer is one order higher than those of metals. So by coating the sample surface with a layer of polymer, the expansion signal could be enhanced. More importantly, after coating, the signal only depends on the temperature, independent of the expansion coefficient of different materials, allowing for SJEM to be used for a wide array of samples. Expansion signal increases linearly with temperature and thus quadratically with voltage. In addition, expansion signal increases monotonically with the thickness of coating polymer, while the resolution will decrease due to greater thermal diffusion. Lastly, expansion signal decreases as the frequency increases.

===Extraction of Temperature===
By using the expansion signal, the temperature can be extracted as follows: the signal that captured by the lock-in amplifier is converted into the bending of cantilever. Using &lt;math&gt;\Delta\,L{{=}}\alpha\,\!_{CET}L\Delta\,T&lt;/math&gt;,and applying the known expansion coefficient, &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!_{CET}&lt;/math&gt; and polymer thickness, L(which could be measured by AFM or ellipsometer), the expansion signal is obtained. The smallest expansion that can be resolved is about 10pm. 
In order to extract accurate temperatures, additional modeling taking into account thermal expansion and cantilever bending is necessary. Moreover, calibration using a reference system, such as metallic films, is required.

==Modeling==

===One-dimensional transient finite element model===
When the sample is large enough, edge effects can be ignored. Therefore, a simple one-dimensional finite element model can be a good approximation.

The basic thermal equation is:

&lt;math&gt;\rho\,\!C_p{\operatorname{d}T\over\operatorname{d}t}{{=}}\nabla\left ( k\nabla\ T \right )+ Q&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ρCp is the heat capacitance;K is the thermal conductivity and Q is the input power.

Rearrange the equation in a discrete form according to each element:

&lt;math&gt;\rho\,\!C_p\frac{T_n^t-T_n^{t-1}}{\Delta\ t}{{=}}k_n\frac{T_{n-1}^t-T_n^{t}}{\Delta\ x^2}+k_{n+1}\frac{T_{n+1}^t-T_n^{t}}{\Delta\ x^2}+Q_n&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;T_n^t&lt;/math&gt; represents the specific temperature of position element n at time element t. Using software could solve the equations and obtained the temperature T.
The expansion magnitude could be obtained by:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta\,L{{=}}\alpha\,\!_{CET}L\Delta\,T&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!_{CET}&lt;/math&gt;
is the thermal expansion coefficient of the polymer and L is its thickness.

===Two- or three-dimensional finite element model with electrical-thermal-mechanical coupling===
Commercialized software can be used for 2D/3D finite element modeling. In such software, the appropriate differential equations for electrical, thermal and mechanical expansion are chosen and proper boundary conditions are set. In addition, electrical-thermal coupling exists in the sample because the resistance is a function of temperature. This is additionally accounted for by typical FEM software packages.

==Applications==

===Integrated circuit interconnects===
Miniaturization of modern integrated circuits has led to hugely increased current densities and therefore, self-heating.  In particular, vias, or vertical interconnects, experience extreme local temperature fluctuations, which can strongly influence the electrical performance of multi-level interconnect structures.  In addition, these large, highly localized temperature fluctuations cause repeated stress gradients on the vias, ultimately leading to device failure.  Traditional thermometry techniques use electrical characterization to determine resistivity and estimate the average temperature along an interconnect.  However, this method is not able to characterize local temperature rises which may be significantly higher near vias due to their extremely high aspect ratios. Optical methods are diffraction limited to resolutions greater than 1&amp;nbsp;um, far larger than most modern vias feature sizes. SJEM has been used to do in situ thermal mapping of these devices with lateral resolution in the sub-0.1&amp;nbsp;um range.&lt;ref name="Igeta"&gt;M. Igeta, K. Banerjee, G.Wu, C. Hu, and A. Majumdar, “Thermal characteristics of submicron vias studied by scanning Joule expansion microscopy,” ''IEEE Electron Device Lett.'', 21, 224 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, size effects also play an important role in modern interconnects.  As dimensions of the metal decrease, thermal conductivity begins to decrease from that of the bulk material, further creating cause for concern. SJEM has been used to extract thermal conductivities of constrictions in different thicknesses of thin metallic films. The extracted values show agreement with those predicted by the Wiedemann-Franz law.&lt;ref name="Gurrum"/&gt;

===Integrated circuit transistors===
Understanding thermal properties of transistors are vital for the semiconductor industry as well. Similar to interconnects, repeated thermal stresses can eventually lead to device failure.  However, more importantly, electrical behavior, and therefore device parameters change significantly with temperature.  SJEM has been used to map local hotspots in thin film transistors.&lt;ref name="Bolte"/&gt;  By determining the location of these hotspots, they can be better understood and reduced or eliminated.  One disadvantage to this method is that, like AFM, only the surface can be mapped. Consequently, additional processing steps would be required in order to map buried features, such as most features in modern IC transistors.

===Nanoscale materials===
Nanoscale materials are becoming widely investigated for their many advantages in commercial electronics. In particular, these materials are known for excellent mobility as well as ability to carry high current densities. In addition, new applications have been realized for these materials including thermoelectrics, solar cells, fuel cells, etc. However, significant decrease in size scale in conjunction with increases in current density and device density leads to extreme temperature rises in these devices. These temperature fluctuations can influence electrical behavior and lead to device failure. Therefore, these thermal effects must be studied carefully, in situ, to realize nanoscale electronics.  SJEM can be used for this purpose, allowing for in situ high-resolution thermal mapping.

Possible materials and devices for thermal mapping include high electron mobility transistors,&lt;ref name="Dietzel"&gt;D. Dietzel, R. Meckenstock, S. Chotikaprakhan, J. Bolte, J. Pelzl, R. Aubry, J. C. Jacquet, and S. Cassette, ''Superlattices Microstruct''. 35, 477 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; nanotubes, nanowires, graphene sheets, nanomeshes, and nanoribbons, and other molecular electronic materials. In particular, SJEM can be directly used for characterization of band gap distributions in nanotube transistors, nanowires, and graphene nanomeshes and nanoribbons. It can also be used to locate hotspots and defects in these materials.  Another example of a simple, direct application is thermal mapping of rough nanowires for thermolelectric applications.

==Remaining Questions==
Although SJEM is a very powerful technique for temperature detection, significant questions still remain regarding its performance.

This technique is far more complex than traditional AFM. Unlike AFM, SJEM needs to consider the type of polymer, the thickness of polymer used to coat the sample and the frequency to drive the device.&lt;ref name="Gurrum"&gt;S. P. Gurrum, W.P. King, Y.K. Joshi, K. Ramakrishna, “Size Effect
on the Thermal Conductivity of Thin Metallic Films Investigated by Scanning Joule Expansion
Microscopy”, ''Journal of heat transfer'', 130,082403, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This additional processing often can degrade or compromise the integrity of the sample. For micro/nano devices, wire-bonding is usually necessary to apply voltage, further increasing processing and decreasing throughput. During scanning, the magnitude of the voltage, frequency, and scanning speeds need to be considered. Calibration must also be done using a reference system in order to ensure accuracy. Finally, a complex model must be used to account for all these factors and parameters.

Second, there may be artifact effects near the edges (or steps). Near the edges where large height differences or material mismatches exist, artifact expansion signals are usually detected. The exact cause has not been found. It is widely believed that the tip sample interaction near the edges can account for these artifacts. At the edges, forces are present not only in the vertical direction but possibly also in the lateral direction, disrupting the cantilever motion. In addition, at a large step, loss of contact between the tip and the sample could result in an artifact in the image. Another concern is that the polymer coating near the step may not be uniform, or possibly not continuous. Further investigations near edges and junctions need to be carried out.  
   
Finally, interactions between the tip and electric field can occur when large gate biases are applied to the substrate. Fringing effects and other geometric concerns can lead to electric field concentrations, leading to large deviations from the normal baseline tip interaction which cannot be easily subtracted. This is especially problematic where the polymer expansion is small, leading to artifacts from this effect dominating. The contribution from these artifacts can be reduced by applying thicker polymer coatings or operating at a lower gate bias to decrease electric field. However, this occurs at the expense of resolution due to increased thermal diffusion in the thicker polymer layer as well as increased noise. In addition, devices may not be fully modulated at lower gate biases.

'''Social balance theory''' is a class of theories about balance or imbalance of sentiment relation in [[dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] or [[triad (sociology)|triadic]] relations with [[social network]] [[theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Hokky Situngkir and Deni Khanafiah. 2004.

Disliking exists between the two subgroups within liking agents.

==Development of the theory==
This theory evolved over time to produce models more closely resembling real-world social networks.  It uses a balance index to measure the effect of local balance on that of a global level and also on a more intimate level, like in interpersonal relationships. Dorwin Cartwright and [[Frank Harary]] introduced ''clustering'' to account for multiple social [[cliques]].  Davis introduced ''[[hierarchical clustering]]'' to account for asymmetric relations.

[[File:Four Fundamental States of Matter.png|thumb|right|370px|The four fundamental states of matter. Clockwise from top left, they are solid, liquid, plasma, and gas, represented by an [[ice sculpture]], a [[Drop (liquid)|drop]] of water, [[electrical arc]]ing from a [[tesla coil]], and the air around clouds, respectively.]]

In [[physics]], a '''state of matter''' is one of the distinct forms in which [[matter]] can exist. Four states of matter are observable in everyday life: [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Many other states are known to exist, such as [[glass]] or [[liquid crystal]], and some only exist under extreme conditions, such as [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s,  [[neutron-degenerate matter]], and [[quark-gluon plasma]], which only occur, respectively, in situations of extreme cold, extreme density, and extremely high-energy. Some other states are believed to be possible but remain theoretical for now.  For a complete list of all exotic states of matter, see the [[list of states of matter]].

Historically, the distinction is made based on qualitative differences in properties. Matter in the solid state maintains a fixed volume and shape, with component particles ([[atoms]], [[molecules]] or [[ions]]) close together and fixed into place. Matter in the liquid state maintains a fixed volume, but has a variable shape that adapts to fit its container. Its particles are still close together but move freely. Matter in the gaseous state has both variable volume and shape, adapting both to fit its container. Its particles are neither close together nor fixed in place. Matter in the plasma state has variable volume and shape, but as well as neutral atoms, it contains a significant number of ions and electrons, both of which can move around freely.

The term [[Phase (matter)|phase]] is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter, but a system can contain several immiscible phases of the same state of matter.

== The four fundamental states ==

===Solid===

[[Image:Stohrem.jpg|thumb|right|A crystalline solid: atomic resolution image of [[strontium titanate]]. Brighter atoms are [[Strontium|Sr]] and darker ones are [[Titanium|Ti]].]]

{{Main|Solid}}

In a solid, constituent particles (ions, atoms, or molecules) are closely packed together. The [[Bonding in solids|forces between particles]] are so strong that the particles cannot move freely but can only vibrate. As a result, a solid has a stable, definite shape, and a definite volume. Solids can only change their shape by force, as when broken or cut.

In [[crystal|crystalline solids]], the particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) are packed in a regularly ordered, repeating pattern. There are various different [[crystal structure]]s, and the same substance can have more than one structure (or solid phase). For example, [[iron]] has a [[cubic crystal system|body-centred cubic]] structure at temperatures below 912&amp;nbsp;°C, and a [[cubic crystal system|face-centred cubic]] structure between 912 and 1394&amp;nbsp;°C. [[Ice]] has fifteen known crystal structures, or fifteen solid phases, which exist at various temperatures and pressures.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Glass]]es and other non-crystalline, [[amorphous solid]]s without [[order and disorder (physics)|long-range order]] are not [[thermal equilibrium]] ground states; therefore they are described below as nonclassical states of matter.

Solids can be transformed into liquids by melting, and liquids can be transformed into solids by freezing. Solids can also change directly into gases through the process of [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], and gases can likewise change directly into solids through [[deposition (phase transition)|deposition]].

===Liquid===
[[Image:Teilchenmodell Flüssigkeit.svg|thumb|Structure of a classical monatomic liquid. Atoms have many nearest neighbors in contact, yet no long-range order is present.]]
{{Main|Liquid}}
A liquid is a nearly incompressible [[fluid]] that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. The volume is definite if the [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] are constant. When a solid is heated above its [[melting point]], it becomes liquid, given that the pressure is higher than the [[triple point]] of the substance. Intermolecular (or interatomic or interionic) forces are still important, but the molecules have enough energy to move relative to each other and the structure is mobile. This means that the shape of a liquid is not definite but is determined by its container. The volume is usually greater than that of the corresponding solid, the best known exception being water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The highest temperature at which a given liquid can exist is its [[critical temperature]].&lt;ref name=White&gt;

[[File:Gas molecules.gif|thumb|right|The spaces between gas molecules are very big. Gas molecules have very weak or no bonds at all. The molecules in "gas" can move freely and fast.]]

{{Main|Gas}}
A gas is a compressible fluid. Not only will a gas conform to the shape of its container but it will also expand to fill the container.

In a gas, the molecules have enough [[kinetic energy]] so that the effect of intermolecular forces is small (or zero for an [[ideal gas]]), and the typical distance between neighboring molecules is much greater than the molecular size. A gas has no definite shape or volume, but occupies the entire container in which it is confined. A liquid may be converted to a gas by heating at constant pressure to the [[boiling point]], or else by reducing the pressure at constant temperature.

At temperatures below its [[critical temperature]], a gas is also called a [[vapor]], and can be liquefied by compression alone without cooling. A vapor can exist in equilibrium with a liquid (or solid), in which case the gas pressure equals the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid (or solid).

A [[supercritical fluid]] (SCF) is a gas whose temperature and pressure are above the critical temperature and [[critical temperature|critical pressure]] respectively. In this state, the distinction between liquid and gas disappears. A supercritical fluid has the physical properties of a gas, but its high density confers solvent properties in some cases, which leads to useful applications. For example, [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] is used to [[supercritical fluid extraction|extract]] [[caffeine]] in the manufacture of [[decaffeination|decaffeinated]] coffee.&lt;ref name=Turrell&gt;

===Plasma===
[[File:Electron Sea (Plasma).jpg|thumb|right|In a plasma, electrons are ripped away from their nuclei, forming an electron "sea". This gives it the ability to conduct electricity.]]

{{Main|Plasma (physics)}}
Like a gas, plasma does not have definite shape or volume. Unlike gases, plasmas are electrically conductive, produce magnetic fields and electric currents, and respond strongly to electromagnetic forces. Positively charged nuclei swim in a "sea" of freely-moving disassociated electrons, similar to the way such charges exist in conductive metal, where this electron "sea"  allows matter in the plasma state to conduct electricity.

A gas is usually converted to a plasma in one of two ways. e.g. Either from a huge voltage difference between two points, or by exposing it to extremely high temperatures. Heating matter to high temperatures causes electrons to leave the atoms, resulting in the presence of free electrons. This creates a so-called partially ionised plasma. At very high temperatures, such as those present in stars, it is assumed that essentially all electrons are "free", and that a very high-energy plasma is essentially bare nuclei swimming in a sea of electrons. This forms the so-called fully ionised plasma.

The plasma state is often misunderstood, and although not freely existing under normal conditions on Earth, it is quite commonly generated by either [[lightning]], [[electric spark]]s, [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lights]], [[Neon sign|neon lights]] or in [[Plasma display|plasma televisions]]. Also plasma appears in some types of [[flame]], the Sun's [[corona]], and stars are all examples of illuminated matter in the plasma state.

==Phase transitions==

{{Main|Phase transitions}}

{{wide image|Physics matter state transition 1 en.svg|800px|This diagram illustrates transitions between the four fundamental states of matter.}}

A state of matter is also characterized by [[phase transitions]]. A phase transition indicates a change in structure and can be recognized by an abrupt change in properties. A distinct state of matter can be defined as any set of [[thermodynamic state|states]] distinguished from any other set of states by a [[phase transition]]. Water can be said to have several distinct solid states.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of superconductivity is associated with a phase transition, so there are [[superconductivity|superconductive]] states. Likewise, [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] states are demarcated by phase transitions and have distinctive properties.
When the change of state occurs in stages the intermediate steps are called [[mesophase]]s. Such phases have been exploited by the introduction of [[liquid crystal]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;

The state or ''phase'' of a given set of matter can change depending on [[pressure]] and [[temperature]] conditions, transitioning to other phases as these conditions change to favor their existence; for example, solid transitions to liquid with an increase in temperature. Near [[absolute zero]], a substance exists as a [[solid]]. As heat is added to this substance it melts into a liquid at its [[melting point]], boils into a gas at its [[boiling point]], and if heated high enough would enter a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] state in which the [[electrons]] are so energized that they leave their parent atoms.

Forms of matter that are not composed of molecules and are organized by different forces can also be considered different states of matter. [[Superfluids]] (like [[Fermionic condensate]]) and the [[quark–gluon plasma]] are examples.

In a chemical equation, the state of matter of the chemicals may be shown as (s) for solid, (l) for liquid, and (g) for gas. An [[aqueous solution]] is denoted (aq). Matter in the plasma state is seldom used (if at all) in chemical equations, so there is no standard symbol to denote it. In the rare equations that plasma is used in plasma is symbolized as (p).

[[Glass]] is a non-crystalline or [[amorphous solid]] material that exhibits a [[glass transition]] when heated towards the liquid state. Glasses can be made of quite different classes of materials: inorganic networks (such as window glass, made of [[silicate]] plus additives), metallic alloys, ionic melts, aqueous solutions, molecular liquids, and polymers.
Thermodynamically, a glass is in a [[metastable state]] with respect to its crystalline counterpart. The conversion rate, however, is practically zero.

=== Crystals with some degree of disorder ===

A [[plastic crystal]] is a molecular solid with long-range positional order but with constituent molecules retaining rotational freedom; in an [[orientational glass]] this degree of freedom is frozen in a [[order and disorder (physics)|quenched disordered]] state.

Similarly, in a [[spin glass]] magnetic disorder is frozen.

===Liquid crystal states===
{{Main|Liquid crystal}}

Liquid crystal states have properties intermediate between mobile liquids and ordered solids. Generally, they are able to flow like a liquid, but exhibiting long-range order. For example, the [[Liquid crystal#Nematic phase|nematic phase]] consists of long rod-like molecules such as [[para-azoxyanisole]], which is nematic in the temperature range 118–136&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phase Transitions of Liquid Crystal PAA in Confined Geometries|author=Shao, Y.|author2=Zerda, T. W.|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=1998|volume=102|issue=18|pages=3387–3394|doi=10.1021/jp9734437}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this state the molecules flow as in a liquid, but they all point in the same direction (within each domain) and cannot rotate freely. Like a crystalline solid, but unlike a liquid, liquid crystals react to polarized light.

Other types of liquid crystals are described in the main article on these states. Several types have technological importance, for example, in [[liquid crystal display]]s.

===Magnetically ordered===
[[Transition metal]] atoms often have [[magnetic moment]]s due to the net [[spin (physics)|spin]] of electrons that remain unpaired and do not form chemical bonds. In some solids the magnetic moments on different atoms are ordered and can form a ferromagnet, an antiferromagnet or a ferrimagnet.

In a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnet]]—for instance, solid [[iron]]—the magnetic moment on each atom is aligned in the same direction (within a [[magnetic domain]]). If the domains are also aligned, the solid is a permanent [[magnet]], which is magnetic even in the absence of an external [[magnetic field]]. The [[magnetization]] disappears when the magnet is heated to the [[Curie point]], which for iron is 768&amp;nbsp;°C.

An [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnet]] has two networks of equal and opposite magnetic moments, which cancel each other out so that the net magnetization is zero. For example, in [[nickel(II) oxide]] (NiO), half the nickel atoms have moments aligned in one direction and half in the opposite direction.

In a [[ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnet]], the two networks of magnetic moments are opposite but unequal, so that cancellation is incomplete and there is a non-zero net magnetization. An example is [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which contains Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions with different magnetic moments.

A [[quantum spin liquid]] (QSL) is a disordered state in a system of interacting quantum spins which preserves its disorder to very low temperatures, unlike other disordered states. It is not a liquid in physical sense, but a solid whose magnetic order is inherently disordered. The name "liquid" is due to an analogy with the molecular disorder in a conventional liquid. A QSL is neither a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnet]], where magnetic domains are parallel, nor an [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnet]], where the magnetic domains are antiparallel; instead, the magnetic domains are randomly oriented. This can be realized e.g. by [[Geometrical frustration|geometrically frustrated]] magnetic moments that cannot point uniformly parallel or antiparallel. When cooling down and settling to a state, the domain must "choose" an orientation, but if the possible states are similar in energy, one will be chosen randomly. Consequently, despite strong short-range order, there is no long-range magnetic order.

===Microphase-separated===
{{Main|Copolymer}}

[[File:Sbs block copolymer.jpg|thumb|right|SBS block copolymer in [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]]] [[Copolymers]] can undergo microphase separation to form a diverse array of periodic nanostructures, as shown in the example of the [[Kraton (polymer)|styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer]] shown at right. Microphase separation can be understood by analogy to the phase separation between [[oil]] and water. Due to chemical incompatibility between the blocks, block copolymers undergo a similar phase separation. However, because the blocks are [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] to each other, they cannot demix macroscopically as water and oil can, and so instead the blocks form [[nanometer]]-sized structures. Depending on the relative lengths of each block and the overall block topology of the polymer, many morphologies can be obtained, each its own phase of matter.

[[Ionic liquid]]s also display microphase separation. The anion and cation are not necessarily compatible and would demix otherwise, but electric charge attraction prevents them from separating. Their anions and cations appear to diffuse within compartmentalized layers or micelles instead of freely as in a uniform liquid.&lt;ref&gt;Álvarez, V.

==Low-temperature states==

===Superfluid===
[[Image:Liquid helium Rollin film.jpg|thumb|Liquid [[helium]] in a superfluid phase creeps up on the walls of the cup in a [[Rollin film]], eventually dripping out from the cup.]]
{{Main|Superfluid}}
Close to absolute zero, some liquids form a second liquid state described as '''superfluid''' because it has zero [[viscosity]] (or infinite fluidity; i.e., flowing without friction). This was discovered in 1937 for [[helium]], which forms a superfluid below the [[lambda point|lambda temperature]] of 2.17 K. In this state it will attempt to "climb" out of its container.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has infinite [[thermal conductivity]] so that no [[temperature gradient]] can form in a superfluid. Placing a superfluid in a spinning container will result in [[quantum vortex|quantized vortices]].

These properties are explained by the theory that the common isotope [[helium-4]] forms a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] (see next section) in the superfluid state. More recently, [[Fermionic condensate]] superfluids have been formed at even lower temperatures by the rare isotope [[helium-3]] and by [[Isotopes of lithium|lithium-6]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Bose–Einstein condensate===
[[Image:Bose Einstein condensate.png|right|thumb|Velocity in a gas of [[rubidium]] as it is cooled: the starting material is on the left, and Bose–Einstein condensate is on the right.]]
{{Main|Bose–Einstein condensate}}
In 1924, [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] predicted the "Bose–Einstein condensate" (BEC), sometimes referred to as the fifth state of matter. In a BEC, matter stops behaving as independent particles, and collapses into a single quantum state that can be described with a single, uniform wavefunction.

In the gas phase, the Bose–Einstein condensate remained an unverified theoretical prediction for many years. In 1995, the research groups of [[Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]], of [[JILA]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], produced the first such condensate experimentally. A Bose–Einstein condensate is "colder" than a solid. It may occur when atoms have very similar (or the same) [[Energy level|quantum levels]], at temperatures very close to [[absolute zero]] (−273.15&amp;nbsp;°C).

===Fermionic condensate===
{{main|Fermionic condensate}}
A ''fermionic condensate'' is similar to the Bose–Einstein condensate but composed of [[fermion]]s. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] prevents fermions from entering the same quantum state, but a pair of fermions can behave as a boson, and multiple such pairs can then enter the same quantum state without restriction.

===Rydberg molecule===
One of the [[metastable state]]s of strongly non-ideal plasma is [[Rydberg matter]], which forms upon condensation of [[excited state|excited atoms]]. These atoms can also turn into [[ion]]s and [[electron]]s if they reach a certain temperature. In April 2009, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' reported the creation of Rydberg molecules from a Rydberg atom and a [[ground state]] atom,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment was performed using ultracold [[rubidium]] atoms.

===Quantum Hall state===
{{main|Quantum Hall effect}}
A ''quantum Hall state'' gives rise to quantized [[Hall voltage]] measured in the direction perpendicular to the current flow. A ''[[Quantum spin Hall effect|quantum spin Hall state]]'' is a theoretical phase that may pave the way for the development of electronic devices that dissipate less energy and generate less heat. This is a derivation of the Quantum Hall state of matter.

===Photonic matter===
{{main|Photonic matter}}
Photonic matter is a phenomenon where [[photon]]s interacting with a gas develop apparent mass, and can interact with each other, even forming photonic "molecules". The source of mass is the gas, which is massive. This is in contrast to photons moving in empty space, which have no [[rest mass]], and cannot interact.

===Dropleton===

==High-energy states==

===Degenerate matter===
{{Main|Degenerate matter}}
Under extremely high pressure, as in the cores of dead stars, ordinary matter undergoes a transition to a series of exotic states of matter collectively known as [[degenerate matter]], which are supported mainly by quantum mechanical effects. In physics, "degenerate" refers to two states that have the same energy and are thus interchangeable. Degenerate matter is supported by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which prevents two [[fermion]]ic particles from occupying the same quantum state. Unlike regular plasma, degenerate plasma expands little when heated, because there are simply no momentum states left. Consequently, degenerate stars collapse into very high densities. More massive degenerate stars are smaller, because the gravitational force increases, but pressure does not increase proportionally.

[[Degenerate matter|Electron-degenerate matter]] is found inside [[white dwarf]] stars. Electrons remain bound to atoms but are able to transfer to adjacent atoms. [[Degenerate matter|Neutron-degenerate matter]] is found in [[neutron star]]s. Vast gravitational pressure compresses atoms so strongly that the electrons are forced to combine with protons via inverse beta-decay, resulting in a superdense conglomeration of neutrons. Normally [[Neutron|free neutrons]] outside an atomic nucleus will [[Radioactive decay|decay]] with a half life of just under 15 minutes, but in a neutron star, the decay is overtaken by inverse decay. Cold degenerate matter is also present in planets such as [[Jupiter]] and in the even more massive [[brown dwarf]]s, which are expected to have a core with [[metallic hydrogen]]. Because of the degeneracy, more massive brown dwarfs are not significantly larger. In metals, the electrons can be modeled as a degenerate gas moving in a lattice of non-degenerate positive ions.

===Quark matter===
{{Main|QCD matter}}
In regular cold matter, [[quark]]s, fundamental particles of nuclear matter, are confined by the [[strong force]] into [[hadron]]s that consist of 2–4 quarks, such as protons and neutrons. Quark matter or quantum chromodynanamical (QCD) matter is a group of phases where the strong force is overcome and quarks are deconfined and free to move. Quark matter phases occur at extremely high densities or temperatures, and there are no known ways to produce them in equilibrium in the laboratory; in ordinary conditions, any quark matter formed immediately undergoes radioactive decay.

[[Strange matter]] is a type of [[quark matter]] that is suspected to exist inside some neutron stars close to the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]] (approximately 2–3 [[solar mass]]es), although there is no direct evidence of its existence. In strange matter, part of the energy available manifests as [[strange quark]]s, a heavier analogue of the common [[down quark]]. It may be stable at lower energy states once formed, although this is not known.

[[Quark–gluon plasma]] is a very high-temperature phase in which [[quark]]s become free and able to move independently, rather than being perpetually bound into particles, in a sea of [[gluon]]s, subatomic particles that transmit the [[strong interaction|strong force]] that binds quarks together. This is analogous to the liberation of electrons from atoms in a plasma. This state is briefly attainable in extremely high-energy heavy ion collisions in [[particle accelerator]]s, and allows scientists to observe the properties of individual quarks, and not just theorize. Quark–gluon plasma was discovered at [[CERN]] in 2000. Unlike plasma, which flows like a gas, interactions within QGP are strong and it flows like a liquid.

At high densities but relatively low temperatures, quarks are theorized to form a quark liquid whose nature is presently unknown. It forms a distinct [[Color–flavor locking|color-flavor locked]] (CFL) phase at even higher densities. This phase is [[superconductive]] for color charge. These phases may occur in [[neutron star]]s but they are presently theoretical.

===Color-glass condensate===
{{Main|Color-glass condensate}}
Color-glass condensate is a type of matter theorized to exist in atomic nuclei traveling near the speed of light. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, a high-energy nucleus appears length contracted, or compressed, along its direction of motion. As a result, the gluons inside the nucleus appear to a stationary observer as a "gluonic wall" traveling near the speed of light. At very high energies, the density of the gluons in this wall is seen to increase greatly. Unlike the quark–gluon plasma produced in the collision of such walls, the color-glass condensate describes the walls themselves, and is an intrinsic property of the particles that can only be observed under high-energy conditions such as those at RHIC and possibly at the Large Hadron Collider as well.

==Very high energy states==
Various theories predict new states of matter at very high energies. An unknown state has created the [[baryon asymmetry]] in the universe, but little is known about it. In [[string theory]], a [[Hagedorn temperature]] is predicted for superstrings at about 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; K, where superstrings are copiously produced. At [[Planck temperature]] (10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; K), gravity becomes a significant force between individual particles. No current theory can describe these states and they cannot be produced with any foreseeable experiment. However, these states are important in [[cosmology]] because the universe may have passed through these states in the [[Big Bang]].

The '''[[gravitational singularity]]''' predicted by [[general relativity]] to exist at the center of a [[black hole]] is ''not'' a phase of matter; it is not a material object at all (although the mass-energy of matter contributed to its creation) but rather a property of [[spacetime]] at a location. It could be argued, of course, that all particles are properties of spacetime at a location,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Chalmers|author2=David Manley|author3=Ryan Wasserman|title=Metametaphysics: New Essays on the Foundations of Ontology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nqzIi16CY0C&amp;pg=PA378|date=2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-954604-6|pages=378–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917070144/http://books.google.com/books?id=6nqzIi16CY0C&amp;pg=PA378|archivedate=17 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving a half-note of controversy on the subject.

==Other proposed states==

===Supersolid===
{{Main|Supersolid}}
A supersolid is a spatially ordered material (that is, a solid or crystal) with superfluid properties. Similar to a superfluid, a supersolid is able to move without friction but retains a rigid shape. Although a supersolid is a solid, it exhibits so many characteristic properties different from other solids that many argue it is another state of matter.&lt;ref&gt;

===String-net liquid===
{{main|String-net liquid}}
In a string-net liquid, atoms have apparently unstable arrangement, like a liquid, but are still consistent in overall pattern, like a solid. When in a normal solid state, the atoms of matter align themselves in a grid pattern, so that the spin of any electron is the opposite of the spin of all electrons touching it. But in a string-net liquid, atoms are arranged in some pattern that requires some electrons to have neighbors with the same spin. This gives rise to curious properties, as well as supporting some unusual proposals about the fundamental conditions of the universe itself.

===Superglass===
{{Main|Superglass}}
A superglass is a phase of matter characterized, at the same time, by [[superfluid]]ity and a frozen amorphous structure.

===Dark matter===
{{Main|Dark matter}}
While dark matter is estimated to comprise 83% of the mass of matter in the [[universe]], most of its properties remain a mystery due to the fact that it neither [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbs]] nor [[Emission spectrum|emits]] [[electromagnetic radiation]], and there are many competing theories regarding what dark matter is actually made of. Thus, while it is hypothesized to exist and comprise the vast majority of matter in the universe, almost all of its properties are unknown and a matter of speculation, because it has only been observed through its [[gravitation]]al effects.&lt;ref name="Trimble 1987" &gt;{{cite journal | authorlink= Virginia Trimble |last=Trimble | first=Virginia | title=Existence and nature of dark matter in the universe | journal=[[Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics]] | volume=25 | pages=425–472 | date=1987 | bibcode=1987ARA&amp;A..25..425T|doi = 10.1146/annurev.aa.25.090187.002233 |url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2hz008rs |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{for|management of marketing tags|tag management system}}
'''Tag management''' is the ability to manage user-generated [[Tag_(metadata)|tags]] (also known as categories, taxonomies or [[folksonomy|folksonomies]]) within [[collaborative software]]. Tag management features and processes are put in place to encourage cross-user consistency, navigation efficiency and compliance with an existing [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]].

== Tag management a priori ==
The tags that users will be able to use can be controlled up-hill (before they have entered the data set) by
* [[Faceted classification]], categorizing tags in facets (e.g. organization or place facet)
* ''Predefining tags'', authority lists of tags can be created and suggested to users
* ''Restricting tag creation'', allow users to create or not new tags other than predefined tags
* ''Mandatory facets'', meaning a user must categorize each item with at least a tag from this facet
* ''Relating tags'', meaning selecting a tag will also display the results of other tags related to it (e.g. synonyms or translations)

== Tag management a posteriori ==
Tags can be gardened down-hill (after they have entered the data set) by
* Renamintypos)

* Moving tags to correct facets (e.g. an organization name)
* Merging tags (e.g. single and plural words)

== Examples of tag management ==
* [[Content management systems]]: [[WordPress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.support.wordpress.com/posts/tag-management/ |title= WordPress tag management |publisher= WordPress |accessdate= 2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft SharePoint]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5127">'''Three Flags Day''' commemorates March 9 and 10, 1804, when [[Spain]] officially completed turning over the [[Louisiana (New Spain)]] colonial territory to [[French First Republic|France]], who then officially turned over the same lands to the [[United States]], in order to finalize the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]].

The ceremony in [[St. Louis]] cleared the way for [[Lewis and Clark]] to begin their exploration.

==Background==
France had ruled Louisiana from its founding until the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] which ended the [[Seven Years' War]] (whose North American phase was the [[French and Indian War]]), in which treaty Spain received the French land west of the [[Mississippi River]] (the "right bank" going downstream) plus [[Île d'Orléans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], and Great Britain received the French lands east of the River (the "left bank") -- which included what had previously been called the [[Illinois Country]] or ''Upper Louisiana''.

Spain officially took control of its territory in 1769, when it suppressed the [[Rebellion of 1768]] by area residents who had resisted Spain's assumption of colonial authority in the formerly French domain.

The United States extended its western boundaries to the Mississippi River during the [[American Revolutionary War]], when General [[George Rogers Clark]] took possession of the lands east of the Mississippi River which had for some years belonged to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. American control of the territory which became today's Midwestern states (the former [[Illinois Country]] and [[Ohio Country]]) was not secure until both the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] and the [[Jay Treaty]] (1794) had been formalized.

On October 1, 1800, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] concluded France's re-acquisition of ''La Louisiane'' (Spanish: ''Luisiana'') from Spain, in the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]].  However, the treaty was kept secret and Spain continued to administer the territory.

The U.S. and France agreed on April 30, 1803, to the American purchase of Louisiana (which was announced publicly in the United States on July 4). However, the U.S. did not immediately take possession of these lands on the west side of the Mississippi, and Spain continued to administer the territory because it had not yet formally turned it over to France.

After the United States' purchase, [[Thomas Jefferson]] announced plans for an exploration of the new territory. Spain, however, prohibited any foreign exploration of its territory. Lewis and Clark were to spend the winter of 1803-04 at [[Camp Dubois]] in what was then the [[Indiana Territory]], opposite the confluence of the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and [[Mississippi River]]s. until the lands had been formally turned over to the United States.

==Ceremonies==
On November 30, 1803, Spain formally transferred the territory in a ceremony at [[the Cabildo]] and [[Jackson Square (New Orleans)|Plaza de Armas]] in New Orleans attended by Spanish Governors [[Juan Manuel de Salcedo]] and [[Sebastián Calvo de la Puerta y O'Farrill]] and new French Governor [[Pierre Clement de Laussat]].  

On December 20, 1803, New Orleans and the rest of [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]] were transferred to the United States in a ceremony with Laussat and incoming United States governor [[William C. C. Claiborne|William C.C. Claiborne]], with Gen. [[James Wilkinson]] in attendance.  However, with navigation on the Mississippi halted because of winter, the news was not conveyed to [[St. Louis]].

On March 9, 1804, [[Amos Stoddard]], the new U.S. lieutenant governor for [[District of Louisiana]], and [[Meriwether Lewis]] arrived in St. Louis by boat and were met by the Spanish lieutenant for Upper Louisiana, [[Carlos de Hault de Lassus]]. Hault de Lassus said:

:People of Upper Louisiana, by order of the king I am now about to surrender this post and its dependencies. The flag which has protected you during nearly 36 years will no longer be seen. The oath you took now ceases to bind. Your faithfulness and courage in upholding it will be remembered forever. From the bottom of my heart I wish you all prosperity.

The Spanish flag was lowered on March 9, and the French flag was hoisted to fly over the city of St. Louis for 24 hours.  The French flag, initially supposed to have been lowered at sunset, remained under guard all night.

The next morning, March 10, 1804, the American [[Flag#Hoisting the flag|flag was hoisted]]. This event is sometimes referred to as the "Three Flag Ceremony" or the "Ceremony of Three Flags."

'''TPoint''' is [[computer]] [[software]] that implements a mathematical [[Model (abstract)|model]] of conditions leading to [[error]]s in [[telescope]] pointing and tracking. The model can then be used in a telescope control system to correct the pointing and tracking. Such errors are typically caused by [[machine|mechanical]] or [[structural]] [[wikt:defect|defects]]. For example, TPoint can analyze and compensate for systematic errors such as [[polar alignment|polar misalignment]], mechanical and optical non-orthogonality, lack of roundness in telescope mounting drive [[gear]]s, as well as for [[flexure]] of the mounting caused by [[gravity]].

TPoint is in use on the majority of professional telescopes worldwide, including the [[Anglo-Australian Observatory]], [[Keck Observatory]], [[Gemini Observatory]], and many others. It has significantly improved the performance and efficiency of telescope operation and has had an especially strong impact on the development of [[Automation|automated]] and [[robotic telescope]]s. 

TPoint is also widely used by [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]]. [[Software Bisque]] distributes TPoint for Mac OS and Windows as an add-on to TheSkyX Serious Astronomer Edition and TheSkyX Professional; this version is used to improve the pointing on amateur telescopes.&lt;ref name=ST-July2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=di Cicco|first=Dennis|title=The Paramount MX|journal=Sky &amp; Telescope|date=July 2012|volume=124|issue=1|pages=64–67|issn=0037-6604}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
TPoint was invented and developed by Patrick Wallace.&lt;ref name=ST-July2012/&gt; It grew out of work he and John Straede performed
at the [[Anglo-Australian Telescope]] (AAT) between 1974 and 1980
using [[Interdata]] 70 computers. In the early 1980s, it was ported to the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[VAX]] running under
the VMS operating system and between 1990 and 1992 was also ported to run on the [[Personal Computer|PC]]/[[MS-DOS]] platform as well
as various [[UNIX]] platforms. A TPoint add-on is available for TheSkyX Serious Astronomer Edition and TheSkyX Professional Edition from Software Bisque, and it runs under both Macintosh OS and Microsoft Windows. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | first = Patrick | last = Wallace | title = TPOINT - Telescope Pointing Analysis System (v4.4) | date = 9 Dec 1994 | publisher = DRAL/ Rutherford Appleton Laboratory | url = http://docs.jach.hawaii.edu/EXTERNAL/SUN/100/sun100.pdf | work = Starlink Project | pages = 27 28 | accessdate = 2013-01-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100611143703/http://docs.jach.hawaii.edu/EXTERNAL/SUN/100/sun100.pdf | archivedate = 11 June 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Values Survey''' ('''WVS'''), a global [[research project]], explores people's [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] and [[belief]]s, how they change over time and what social and political impact they have. Since 1981 a worldwide network of [[social scientists]] have conducted representative national [[Statistical survey|surveys]] as part of WVS in almost 100 countries.

The WVS measures, monitors and analyzes: support for [[democracy]], tolerance of foreigners and [[ethnic minorities]], support for [[gender equality]], the role of [[religion]] and changing levels of [[religiosity]], the impact of [[globalization]], attitudes toward the [[Natural environment| environment]], [[Labour economics |work]], [[family]], [[politics]], national identity, [[culture]], [[multiculturalism |diversity]],  insecurity,  and [[subjective well-being]].

The findings provide information for policy makers seeking to build [[civil society]] and democratic institutions in [[developing countries]].{{cn|date=October 2018}} The work is also frequently used by governments around the world, scholars, students, journalists and international organizations and institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and the United Nations ([[United Nations Development Programme | UNDP]] and [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme | UN-Habitat]]). Data from the World Values Survey have (for example) been used{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to better understand the motivations behind events such as the [[Arab Spring]], the [[2005 French civil unrest]], the [[Rwandan genocide]] in 1994 and the [[Yugoslav wars]] and political upheaval in the 1990s. {{Citation needed|date= December 2014}}

[[Romano Prodi]], former Prime Minister of Italy and the tenth President of the [[European Commission]], said about WVS work:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The growing globalization of the world makes it increasingly important to understand ... diversity.  People with varying beliefs and values can live together and work together productively, but for this to happen it is crucial to understand and appreciate their distinctive [[worldview]]s.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Basanez | Diez-Medrano | Halman | 2004 | p = xiii}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Insights==
The WVS has over the years demonstrated that people's [[beliefs]] play a key role in [[economic development]], the emergence and flourishing of democratic institutions, the rise of [[gender equality]], and the extent to which societies have effective [[government]].

===Inglehart–Welzel cultural map===
{{main|Inglehart–Welzel cultural map of the world}}

Analysis of WVS data made by political scientists [[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Christian Welzel]] asserts that there are two major dimensions of cross cultural variation in the world: 
# '''Traditional values''' versus '''Secular-rational values''' and 
# '''Survival values''' versus '''Self-expression values'''.
The global cultural map (below) shows how scores of societies are located on these two dimensions. Moving upward on this map reflects the shift from Traditional values to Secular-rational and moving rightward reflects the shift from Survival values to Self–expression values.&lt;ref name=wvs-old&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |title=The WVS Cultural Map of the World |publisher=WVS |author1=Ronald Inglehart |author2=Chris Welzel |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019112321/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Traditional values'' emphasize the importance of religion, parent-child ties, deference to authority and traditional family values. People who embrace these values also reject divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide.  These societies have high levels of national pride and a nationalistic outlook.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

''Secular-rational values'' have the opposite preferences to the traditional values. These societies place less emphasis on religion, traditional family values and authority. Divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide are seen as relatively acceptable.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

''Survival values'' place emphasis on economic and physical security. It is linked with a relatively [[ethnocentric]] outlook and low levels of trust and tolerance.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

''Self-expression values'' give high priority to environmental protection, growing tolerance of foreigners, gays and lesbians and gender equality, and rising demands for participation in decision-making in economic and political life.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

====Culture variations====
A somewhat simplified analysis is that following an increase in [[standards of living]], and a transit from development country via [[industrialization]] to  [[post-industrial society|post-industrial]] [[Society#Knowledge society|knowledge society]], a country tends to move diagonally in the direction from lower-left corner (poor) to upper-right corner (rich), indicating a transit in both dimensions.

However, the attitudes among the population are also highly correlated with the philosophical, political and religious ideas that have been dominating in the country. Secular-rational values and [[materialism]] were formulated by philosophers and the [[left-wing politics]] side in the [[French revolution]], and can consequently be observed especially in countries with a long history of social democratic or socialistic policy, and in  countries where a large portion of the population have studied philosophy and science at universities.  Survival values are characteristic for eastern-world countries and self-expression values for western-world countries. In a liberal [[post-industrial economy]], an increasing share of the population has grown up taking survival and freedom of thought for granted, resulting in that self-expression is highly valued.

====Examples====
* Societies that have high scores in Traditional and Survival values: Zimbabwe, Morocco, Jordan, Bangladesh.
* Societies with high scores in Traditional and Self-expression values: the U.S., most of Latin America, Ireland.
* Societies with high scores in Secular-rational and Survival values: Russia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Estonia.
* Societies with high scores in Secular-rational and Self-expression values: Japan, [[Nordic countries]], Benelux, Germany, Switzerland, Czechia, Slovenia, France.

===Gender values===
Findings from the WVS indicate that support for [[gender equality]] is not just a consequence of [[democratization]]. It is part of a broader cultural change that is transforming [[Industrialisation|industrialized societies]] with mass demands for increasingly democratic institutions. Although a majority of the world's population still believes that men make better political leaders than women, this view is fading in advanced industrialized societies, and also among young people in less prosperous countries.{{Sfn | Alesina | Giuliano | Nunn | 2010}}

===Religion===
The data from the World Values Survey cover several important aspects of people's religious orientation.  One of them tracks how involved people are in religious services and how much importance they attach to their religious beliefs.  In the data from 2000, 98% of the public in [[Indonesia]] said that religion was very important in their lives while in [[China]] only three percent considered religion very important.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Basanez | Diez-Medrano | Halman | 2004 | p = 2}}  Another aspect concerns people's attitudes towards the relation between religion and politics and whether they approve of religious spokesmen who try to influence government decisions and people's voting preferences.

In a [[factor analysis]] of the latest wave (6) of World Values Survey data, [[Arno Tausch]] ([[Corvinus University Budapest]]) found that family values in the tradition of [[Joseph Alois Schumpeter]] and religious values in the research tradition of [[Robert Barro]] can be an important positive asset for society. Negative phenomena, like the distrust in the state of law; the shadow economy; the distance from altruistic values; a growing fatigue of democracy; and the lack of entrepreneurial spirit are all correlated with the loss of [[religiosity]]. Tausch based his results on a [[factor analysis]] with [[promax]] rotation of 78 variables from 45 countries with complete data, and also calculated performance indices for the 45 countries with complete data and the nine main global religious denominations. On this account, [[Judaism]] and also [[Protestantism]] emerge as most closely combining religion and the traditions of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Tausch A. (2015) Towards new maps of global human values, based on World Values Survey (6) data. [[Corvinus University Budapest]] https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/63349.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Happiness and life satisfaction===
The WVS has shown that from 1981 to 2007 happiness rose in 45 of the 52 countries for which long-term data are available.&lt;ref name=wvs-old2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_122 |title=Is Denmark the happiest country in the world? |publisher=WVS |author=WVSA |accessdate=9 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019111440/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_122 |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1981, economic development, democratization, and rising social tolerance have increased the extent to which people perceive that they have free choice, which in turn has led to higher levels of happiness around the world, which supports the [[human development theory]].&lt;ref name=wvs-old2/&gt;

===Findings===
Some of the survey's basic findings are:
# Much of the variation in human values between societies boils down to two broad dimensions: a first dimension of “''traditional vs. secular-rational values''” and a second dimension of “''survival vs. self-expression values''.”{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# On the first dimension, traditional values emphasize religiosity, national pride, respect for authority, obedience and marriage. Secular-rational values emphasize the opposite on each of these accounts.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# On the second dimension, survival values involve a priority of security over liberty, non-acceptance of homosexuality, abstinence from political action, distrust in outsiders and a weak sense of happiness. Self-expression values imply the opposite on all these accounts.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# Following the ‘revised theory of modernization,’ values change in predictable ways with certain aspects of modernity. People's priorities shift from traditional to secular-rational values as their ''sense of existential security'' increases (or backwards from secular-rational values to traditional values as their sense of existential security decreases).{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# The largest increase in existential security occurs with the ''transition from agrarian to industrial societies''. Consequently, the largest shift from traditional towards secular-rational values happens in this phase.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# People's priorities shift from survival to self-expression values as their ''sense of individual agency'' increases (or backwards from self-expression values to survival as the sense of individual agency decreases).{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# The largest increase in individual agency occurs with the ''transition from industrial to knowledge societies''. Consequently, the largest shift from survival to self-expression values happens in this phase.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# The value differences between societies around the world show a pronounced ''culture zone pattern''. The strongest emphasis on traditional values and survival values is found in the Islamic societies of the Middle East. By contrast, the strongest emphasis on secular-rational values and self-expression values is found in the Protestant societies of Northern Europe.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Klingemann | 2003 | pp = 341–80}}
# These culture zone differences reflect different ''historical pathways'' of how entire groups of societies entered modernity. These pathways account for people's different senses of existential security and individual agency, which in turn account for their different emphases on secular-rational values and self-expression values.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Klingemann | 2003 | pp = 341–80}}
# Values also differ within societies along such cleavage lines as gender, generation, ethnicity, religious denomination, education, income and so forth.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 551–67}}
# Generally speaking, groups whose living conditions provide people with a stronger sense of existential security and individual agency nurture a stronger emphasis on secular-rational values and self-expression values.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 551–67}}
# However, the ''within''-societal differences in people's values are dwarfed by a factor five to ten by the ''between''-societal differences. On a global scale, basic living conditions differ still much more between than within societies, and so do the experiences of existential security and individual agency that shape people's values.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 551–67}}
# A specific subset of self-expression values—''[[emancipation|emancipative]] values''—combines an emphasis on freedom of choice and equality of opportunities. Emancipative values, thus, involve priorities for lifestyle liberty, gender equality, personal [[autonomy]] and the voice of the people.{{Sfn | Alexander | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 1–21}}
# Emancipative values constitute the key cultural component of a broader process of ''human empowerment''. Once set in motion, this process empowers people to exercise freedoms in their course of actions.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 43–63}}
# If set in motion, human empowerment advances on three levels. On the socio-economic level, human empowerment advances as growing ''action resources'' increase people's capabilities to exercise freedoms. On the socio-cultural level, human empowerment advances as rising ''emancipative values'' increase people's aspirations to exercise freedoms.  On the legal-institutional level, human empowerment advances as widened ''democratic rights'' increase people's entitlements to exercise freedoms.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Klingemann | 2003 | pp = 341–80}}
# Human empowerment is an ''entity of empowering capabilities, aspirations, and entitlements''. As an entity, human empowerment tends to advance in virtuous spirals or to recede in vicious spirals on each of its three levels.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2008 | pp = 126–40}}
# As the cultural component of human empowerment, emancipative values are highly consequential in manifold ways. For one, emancipative values establish a ''civic form of modern individualism'' that favours out-group trust and cosmopolitan orientations towards others.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 1–23}}
# Emancipative values encourage ''nonviolent protest'', even against the risk of repression. Thus, emancipative values provide [[social capital]] that activates societies, makes publics more self-expressive, and vitalizes civil society. Emancipative values advance entire societies’ civic agency.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Deutsch | 2005 | p = 121–46}}
# If emancipative values grow strong in countries that are democratic, they help to ''prevent movements away from democracy''.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# If emancipative values grow strong in countries that are undemocratic, they help to trigger ''movements towards democracy''.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# Emancipative values exert these effects because they encourage mass actions that put power holders under pressures to sustain, substantiate or establish democracy, depending on what the current challenge for democracy is.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# Objective factors that have been found to favour democracy (including economic prosperity, income equality, ethnic homogeneity, world market integration, global media exposure, closeness to democratic neighbours, a Protestant heritage, social capital and so forth) exert an influence on democracy mostly insofar as these factors favour emancipative values.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# Emancipative values do not strengthen people's desire for democracy, for the desire for democracy is universal at this point in history. But emancipative values do change the ''nature of the desire for democracy''. And they do so in a double way.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# For one, emancipative values make people's understanding of democracy more liberal: people with stronger emancipative values emphasize the empowering features of democracy rather than bread-and-butter and law-and-order issues.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# Next, emancipative values make people assess the level of their country's democracy more critical: people with stronger emancipative values rather underrate than overrate their country's democratic performance.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# Together, then, emancipative values generate a ''critical-liberal desire for democracy''. The critical-liberal desire for democracy is a formidable force of democratic reforms.  And, it is the best available predictor of a country's effective level of democracy and of other indicators of good governance. Neither democratic traditions nor cognitive mobilization account for the strong positive impact of emancipative values on the critical-liberal desire for democracy.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# Emancipative values constitute the single most important factor in advancing the [[empowerment]] of women. Economic, religious, and institutional factors that have been found to advance women's empowerment, do so for the most part because they nurture emancipative values.{{Sfn | Alexander | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 1–21}}
# Emancipative values change people's life strategy from an emphasis on securing a decent subsistence level to enhancing human agency. As the shift from subsistence to agency affects entire societies, the overall level of [[subjective well-being]] rises.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 43–63}}
# The emancipative consequences of the human empowerment process are not a culture-specific peculiarity of the ‘West.’ The same empowerment processes that advance emancipative values and a critical-liberal desire for democracy in the ‘West,’ do the same in the ‘East’ and in other culture zones.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2011 | pp = 1–31}}
# The social dominance of Islam and individual identification as Muslim both weaken emancipative values. But among young Muslims with high education, and especially among young Muslim women with high education, the Muslim/Non-Muslim gap over emancipative values closes.{{Sfn | Alexander | Welzel | 2011}}

==History==
The World Values Surveys were designed to test the hypothesis that economic and technological changes are transforming the basic values and motivations of the publics of industrialized societies. The surveys build on the [[European Values Study]] (EVS) first carried out in 1981. The EVS was conducted under the aegis of [[Jan Kerkhofs]] and [[Ruud de Moor]] and continues to be based in the [[Netherlands]] at the [[Tilburg University]]. The 1981 study was largely limited to developed societies, but interest in this project spread so widely that surveys were carried out in more than twenty countries, located on all six inhabited continents. [[Ronald Inglehart]] of the [[University of Michigan]] played a leading role in extending these surveys to be carried out in countries around the world. Today the network includes hundreds of social scientist from more than 100 countries.

Findings from the first wave of surveys pointed to the conclusion that intergenerational changes were taking place in basic values relating to politics, economic life, religion, gender roles, family norms and sexual norms. The values of younger generations differed consistently from those prevailing among older generations, particularly in societies that had experienced rapid economic growth. To examine whether changes were actually taking place in these values and to analyze the underlying causes, a second wave of WVS surveys was carried out in 1990–91. Because these changes seem to be linked with economic and technological development, it was important to include societies across the entire range of development, from low income societies to rich societies.&lt;ref name=wvs51/&gt;

A third wave of surveys was carried out in 1995–97, this time in 55 societies and with increased attention being given to analysing the cultural conditions for democracy. A fourth wave of surveys was carried out in 1999–2001 in 65 societies. A key goal was to obtain better coverage of African and Islamic societies, which had been under-represented in previous surveys. A fifth wave was carried out in 2005–07 and a sixth wave was carried out during 2011–12.&lt;ref name=wvs51&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_51 |title=Building A Worldwide Network Of Social Scientists |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409204339/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_51 |archivedate=April 9, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the European origin of the project, the early waves of the WVS were [[eurocentric]] in emphasis, with little representation in Africa and South-East Asia. To expand, the WVS adopted a decentralised structure, in which social scientists from countries throughout the world participated in the design, execution and analysis of the data, and in publication of findings. In return for providing the data from a survey in their own society, each group obtained immediate access to the data from all participating societies enabling them to analyse social change in a broader perspective.&lt;ref name=wvs51/&gt;

The WVS network has produced over 300 publications in 20 languages and secondary users have produced several thousand additional publications.&lt;ref name=wvs51/&gt; The database of the WVS has been published on the internet with free access.

The official archive of the World Values Survey is located in [ASEP/JDS] [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].

==Methodology==
The World Values Survey uses the [[sample survey]] as its mode of data collection, a systematic and standardized approach to collect information through interviewing representative national samples of individuals. The basic stages of a sample survey are Questionnaire design; [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]]; [[Data collection]] and [[Analysis]].

===Questionnaire design===
For each wave, suggestions for questions are solicited by social scientists from all over the world and a final master [[questionnaire]] is developed in English. Since the start in 1981 each successive wave has covered a broader range of societies than the previous one. Analysis of the data from each wave has indicated that certain questions tapped interesting and important concepts while others were of little value. This has led to the more useful questions or themes being replicated in future waves while the less useful ones have been dropped making room for new questions.{{Sfn | Esmer | 2004 | p = 386}}

The questionnaire is translated into the various national languages and in many cases independently translated back to English to check the accuracy of the translation. In most countries, the translated questionnaire is pre-tested to help identify questions for which the translation is problematic. In some cases certain problematic questions are omitted from the national questionnaire.

===Sampling===
Samples are drawn from the entire population of 18 years and older. The minimum sample is 1000. In most countries, no upper age limit is imposed and some form of stratified random [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] is used to obtain representative national samples. In the first stages, a random selection of sampling points is made based on the given society statistical regions, districts, census units, election sections, [[electoral registers]] or [[polling place]] and central population registers. In most countries the population size and/or degree of [[urbanization]] of these Primary Sampling Units are taken into account. In some countries, individuals are drawn from national registers.{{Sfn | Esmer | 2004 | p = 390}}

===Data collection and field work===
Following the sampling, each country is left with a representative national sample of its public. These persons are then interviewed during a limited time frame decided by the Executive Committee of the World Values Survey using the uniformly structured questionnaires. The survey is carried out by professional organizations using face-to-face [[interviews]] or phone interviews for remote areas. Each country has a Principal Investigator (social scientists working in academic institutions) who is responsible for conducting the survey in accordance with the fixed rules and procedures.  During the field work, the agency has to report in writing according to a specific check-list.  Internal consistency checks are made between the sampling design and the outcome and rigorous data cleaning procedures are followed at the WVS data archive. No country is included in a wave before full documentation has been delivered. This means a data set with the completed methodological questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/survey_2005 | title = World values survey | year = 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a report of country-specific information (for example important political events during the fieldwork, problems particular to the country). Once all the surveys are completed, the Principal Investigator has access to all surveys and data.

===Analysis===
The World Values Survey group works with leading social scientists, recruited from each society studied. They represent a wide range of cultures and perspectives which makes it possible to draw on the insights of well-informed insiders in interpreting the findings. It also helps disseminate social science techniques to new countries.

Each research team, that has contributed to the survey,  analyses the findings according to its hypotheses. Because all researchers obtain data from all of the participating societies, they are also able to compare the values and beliefs of the people of their own society with those from scores of other societies and to test alternative hypotheses. In addition, the participants are invited to international meetings at which they can compare findings and interpretations with other members of the WVS network. The findings are then disseminated through international conferences and joint publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/new_index_publications | title = New index publications | publisher = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
The World Values Survey data has been downloaded by over 100,000 researchers, journalists, policy-makers and others. The data is available on the WVS website which contains tools developed for online analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/index_surveys | title = Index surveys | publisher = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and funding==
The World Values Survey is organised as a network of social scientists coordinated by a central body - the World Values Survey Association. It is established as a non-profit organization seated in Stockholm, Sweden, with a constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_52/files/constitution.pdf | title = Constitution | format = PDF | publisher = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and mission statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_52 | title = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The project is guided by an Executive Committee representing all regions of the world. The Committee is also supported by a Scientific Advisory Committee, a Secretariat and an Archive. The WVS Executive Committee provides leadership and strategic planning for the association. It is responsible for the recruitment of new members, the organization of meetings and workshops, data processing and distribution, capacity building and the promotion of publications and dissemination of results. The WVS Executive Committee also raises funds for central functions and assists member groups in their fundraising.

Each national team is responsible for its own expenses and most surveys are financed by local sources. However, central funding has been obtained in cases where local funding is not possible. Presently, the activities of the WVS Secretariat and WVS Executive Committee are funded by the [[Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation]]. Other funding has been obtained from the [[U.S. National Science Foundation]], the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (SIDA), the Volkswagen Foundation, the [[German Science Foundation (DFG)]] and the [[Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]].
