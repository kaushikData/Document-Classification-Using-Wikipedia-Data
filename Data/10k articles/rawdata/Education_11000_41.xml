'''ASIFA-Hollywood''', an American non-profit organization in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], United States, is a branch member of the "Association Internationale du Film d'Animation" or "ASIFA" (the [[International Animated Film Association]]). Its purpose is to promote the art of film animation in a variety of ways, including its own archive and an annual awards presentation, the [[Annie Awards]]. It is also known as the '''International Animated Film Society'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.asifa-hollywood.org/about-us/ | title = About Us | publisher = ASIFA-Hollywood | accessdate = December 16, 2012 | quote = The International Animated Film Society, ASIFA-Hollywood is a California non profit organization ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many branches of ASIFA exist throughout the world; in the US there are chapters in [[San Francisco]], [[New York City]], [[Atlanta]], [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], the [[Detroit]] area, and others, while internationally, organizations exist in [[Annecy]], France, in Italy, and Japan. ASIFA also sponsors several animation [[film festival]]s throughout the world, including the ASIFA-Hollywood Student Animation Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asifa-hollywood.org/annie-awards-student-films/ "The Annie Awards Again Welcomes Student Films"], on asifa-hollywood.org&lt;/ref&gt;

ASIFA-Hollywood has the largest membership internationally of all other chapters, largely because the most popular cartoons ever produced were by studios and animation professionals located in the city of Burbank, which is also the location of the ASIFA-Hollywood Animation Center. It includes a virtual archive, museum, library and research facility, containing the ASIFA-Hollywood Animation Archive Project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animationresources.org/ Details on AnimationResources.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and projects of ASIFA-Hollywood==
ASIFA-Hollywood was founded in 1957, by [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]], [[Stephen Bosustow]], [[Ward Kimball]], William T. Hurtz, Les Goldman, and [[Bill Littlejohn]], and later chartered by [[UNESCO]] in 1960.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} [[June Foray]] was another early member, and recalled that she joined "a year or so" after the organization was chartered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Shel | last = Dorf | authorlink = Shel Dorf | date = January 1988 | title = June Foray | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 54 | pages = 57–58 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, its board of directors includes Jerry Beck (President), David Derks (Vice-President), Sue Shakespeare (Second Vice-President), Brooke Keesling (Third Vice-President), Jeff Wike (Treasurer), Bill Turner (Secretary), Paul Husband (General Counsel), Jamie Kezlarian Bolio, Jeannette Bonds, Tom Caulfield, Dori Littell-Herrick, Jennifer Klein, Bob Kurtz, Aubry Mintz, Tom Sito, Charles Solomon, Theresa Wiseman, Danny Young and Frank Gladstone (Executive Director), 

===The Annie Awards===
{{main|Annie Award}}

Since 1972, ASIFA-Hollywood has hosted an annual awards ceremony to honor individuals who have made significant contributions to the art of animation. Originally designed to honor the lifetime achievements of veterans of the field, the Annie Awards now recognizes the year’s best animated productions and individual achievements in the field of animation. Qualified members participate in the nomination process and final voting. {{cn|date=February 2017}}

===Film preservation===
Prior to 1950, motion pictures were printed on unstable, flammable nitrate film stock that decomposed over time, placing many early animated films in danger of being lost forever. Through the Animation Preservation Project, ASIFA-Hollywood seeks out to save endangered cartoons, and raises funds to preserve them on safety film stock and digital film.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5411">The '''Advanced Extension Awards''' are a type of school-leaving qualification in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, usually taken in the final year of schooling (age 17/18), and designed to allow students to ''"demonstrate their knowledge, understanding and skills to the full"''. Currently, it is only available for Mathematics and offered by the exam board [[Edexcel]]. 

They were introduced in 2002, in response to the [[UK Government]]'s ''[[Excellence in Cities]]'' report, as a successor to the [[S-level]] examination &amp;ndash; and aimed at the top 10% of students in [[Advanced Level (UK)|A Level]] tests. They are assessed completely by external examinations. 

Due to introduction of the A* grade for A Level courses starting September 2008 (first certification 2010), they have since been phased out, with the exception of the Advanced Extension Award in Mathematics which continues to be available to students.

== Results ==
In 2008, the BBC reported that 32% of entrants in the AEA English gained a Distinction (approximately 776 students), with 34.1% gaining a Merit, and 33.9% not passing&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/education/08/exam_results/aea/html/english.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;.  

According to EducationGuardian.co.uk,&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/alevels2004/story/0,14505,1285758,00.html EducationGuardian.co.uk | Advanced extension awards 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004, 50.4% of the 7246 entrants failed to achieve a grade at all (fail), indicating that the awards are fulfilling their role in separating the elite. Only 18.3% of students attained the top of the two grades available, the Distinction, with the next 31.3% of students receiving the grade of Merit. Given the fact that only the top students in the country sat these examinations, these results indicate that the AEAs were successful at rewarding only the 50-100 students that were most able in a particular subject.

It was possible to obtain an AEA distinction in more than one subject; however given the rarity of AEA distinctions, this was uncommon.

== Available subjects ==
Due to the small numbers of candidates for each subject, the exam boards divided the subjects offered amongst themselves - so unlike for A-Levels, each AEA was only offered by one board.
* [[Biology]] (including [[Human Biology]]) ([[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]])
* [[Business]] ([[OCR (examination board)|OCR]])
* [[Chemistry]] (AQA)
* [[Critical Thinking]] (OCR)
* [[Economics]] (AQA)
* [[English studies|English]] (OCR)
* [[French language|French]] (OCR)
* [[Geography]] ([[Welsh Joint Education Committee|WJEC]])

* [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (Edexcel)
* [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (WJEC)
* [[Welsh language|Welsh]] as a second language (WJEC)

== Withdrawal ==

The last AEA examinations across the full range of subjects took place in June 2009 with results issued in August 2009. After this time the Advanced Extension Award was withdrawn for all subjects except Mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcq.org.uk/attachments/published/449/13a.%20Withdrawal%20of%20AEA%20specs.pdf JCQ | Withdrawal of Advanced Extension Award (AEA) specifications] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725050804/http://www.jcq.org.uk/attachments/published/449/13a.%20Withdrawal%20of%20AEA%20specs.pdf |date=July 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This came after the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) decided that the new A* grade being offered at A level will overlap with the purpose of the AEA, thus rendering them unnecessary. However, the AEA in Mathematics was extended until June 2012, as confirmed by [[Edexcel]] and the [[Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency|QCA]]. This was because it met a "definite need", meaning the A* grade was still not viewed as being challenging enough.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edexcel.com/notices/Pages/aea-extend.aspx Edexcel: Advanced Extension Award (AEA) Extended!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qca.org.uk/qca_4115.aspx QCA | Advanced Extension Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314062108/http://www.qca.org.uk/qca_4115.aspx |date=March 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June 2011 [[Edexcel]] announced that the AEA was being extended yet further for Mathematics, until June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edexcel.com/quals/gce/aea/9801/pages/viewNotice.aspx?notice=2445 Edexcel: Mathematics Advanced Extension Award (AEA) extended further until 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been extended further up to 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.furthermaths.org.uk/what_is_aea]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Boisi Center, Boston College.jpg|thumb|The Boisi Center at [[Boston College]] is located on Quincy Road, adjacent to the [[BC campus]].]]
'''Alan Wolfe''' (born 1942) is a [[political science|political scientist]] and a [[sociologist]]  on the faculty of [[Boston College]] who serves as director of the [[Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life]].  He is also a member of the Advisory Board of the [[Future of American Democracy Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://thefutureofamericandemocracyfoundation.org/index.html The Future Of American Democracy Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit, nonpartisan foundation in partnership with [[Yale University Press]] and the Yale Center for International and Area Studies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/SeriesPage.asp?series=127 Yale Press]&lt;/ref&gt; "dedicated to research and education aimed at renewing and sustaining the historic vision of American democracy".

==Education==
A graduate of [[Central High School (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)]], he received a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] from [[Temple University]] in 1963 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Political Science from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1967. He has [[honorary degree]]s from [[Loyola College in Maryland]] and [[St. Joseph's University]] in Philadelphia.

==Career==
Earlier in his career, Wolfe was a member of the collective that put out the [[Marxist]]-oriented journal, ''Kapitalistate'', whose pages featured articles by such writers as [[Poulantzas]], [[Claus Offe]], [[Ralph Miliband]], and [[Bob Jessop]]. By the early 1980s, Wolfe's politics had become more [[centrism|centrist]].  In 2004, one author characterized him as a [[Radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] thinker.&lt;ref&gt;Satin, Mark (2004).  ''Radical Middle: The Politics We Need Now''.  Westview Press and Basic Books, pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13.  {{ISBN|978-0-8133-4190-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributing editor of ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''The Wilson Quarterly'', ''Commonwealth Magazine'', and ''In Character'', Wolfe writes often for those publications as well as for ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Harper's]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[World Affairs (journal)|World Affairs]]'' and other magazines and newspapers. He served as an advisor to [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] in preparation for his 1995 [[State of the Union Address]] and has lectured widely at American and European universities. He was ranked #98 in the list of the 500 most cited intellectuals in the 2001 book by [[Richard Posner]] titled ''Public Intellectuals''.

Wolfe chairs a task force of the [[American Political Science Association]] on "Religion and Democracy in the United States." He serves on the advisory boards of [[Humanity in Action]] and the Future of American Democracy Foundation and on the president's advisory board of the Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities. He is also a Senior Fellow with the World Policy Institute at the [[New School University]] in New York. In the fall of 2004, Professor Wolfe was the [[George H. W. Bush]] Fellow at the [[American Academy in Berlin]].

"Wolfe, a self-proclaimed [[atheist]], said he recognizes the importance of being open to religious ideas," a 2008 report about an "[[Ethics]] of Atheism" debate put it.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Esquilin, [http://dailyfreepress.com/2008/04/29/celebrated-atheists-debate-the-ethics-of-non-believers/ "Celebrated atheists debate the ethics of non-believers"], ''[[The Daily Free Press]]'', 29 April 2008 (accessed 30 April 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfe has been the recipient of grants from the [[Russell Sage Foundation]], the [[Templeton Foundation]], the [[Smith Richardson Foundation]], the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]], and the [[Lilly Endowment]]. He has twice conducted programs under the auspices of the [[U.S. State Department]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} that bring [[Muslim scholars]] to the United States to learn about [[separation of church and state]]. He is listed in ''Who's Who in the World'', ''Who's Who in America'', and ''Contemporary Authors''.

In this context, the arts can include [[Performing arts education]] ([[dance]], [[drama]], [[music]]), [[literature]] and [[poetry]], [[storytelling]], [[Visual arts education]] in [[film]], [[craft]], [[design]], [[digital arts]], [[Mass media|media]] and [[photography]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Road Map for Arts Education, 2006 http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=30335&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Accessed 19/8/13&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from [[art education]] by being not so much about [[teaching]] art, but focused on:

* how to improve learning through the arts
* how to transfer learning in and through the arts to other disciplines
* discovering and creating understanding of human behavior, thinking, potential, and learning especially through the close observation of works of art and various forms of involvement in arts experiences

== Projects ==
The [[European Union]] has funded the ARTinED (a new approach to education using the arts) project to integrate the arts into every primary school subject ARTinED.

The [[European Commission]] has funded the ART4rom, a project based on the practice of the arts in school and non school environments. The aim of the project is to foster intercultural dialogue, mutual understanding and social inclusion for [[Romani people|Roma]] and non-Roma children aged between 5 and 10.

== Weaknesses ==

The various models of [[education theory]] are predicated on [[Pedagogy]] while almost entirely ignoring the fact that most [[art schools]] are directly involved in the teaching of adults. This blind spot means that the pedagological model of learning is unsuitable for institutions that are intended to focus on [[androgogy]] which is term used specifically in relation to the teaching of adult learners.

== Importance ==
"As the repression builds, art comes to be regarded as 'time off for good behaviour' or as 'therapy'" and how the ease and carefreeness of the arts are supposed to bring joy and a sense of calmness."&lt;ref&gt;Efland, A. (1976). The school art style: A functional analysis. Studies in art education, 37-44.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to destroy the monotony of a regular school day, put a dent in the relentlessness of arithmetic and reading. Art should be seen as means of therapy, never something made to cause unrelenting stress and difficulty. If a student becomes less tense and wired up from stress in their learning environments, then they will raise up their grades in other classes, such as maths, English, or science. To give off a relaxed vibe, putting art on the wall tends to provide a calming environment that produces a sense of peace and serenity. Arts-related activities are important for so much more than just keeping your child busy or relaxed. They’ve been proven to boost a child’s self-image. The self esteem, confidence and pride that comes from art in education is truly incredible and each child should be able to experience that. &lt;ref&gt;Efland, A. (1976). The school art style: A functional analysis. Studies in art education, 37-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In places like the United States, arts education is not as valued. However, some national reforms like the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) requires that arts education, visual and performing, be considered core subjects as they have been proven by many tests to work. Through these requirements schools gain the funds to implement subjects and supplementary items, like books and calculators, that students may need to be successful. Schools can also gain funds by participating in national and regional standardized tests, these tests however, only test students on their ability to perform high in subjects such as math, literacy, and science. Art courses aid student's ability to perform high in these subjects as they challenge a student's brain.{{cn|date=June 2016}} Tests like the [[Mozart effect]], the effect that learning and listening to classical music have on the brain, gives students the ability to learn, reduce stress, and positively change sleeping patterns more easily.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

Art programs within education has its importance in not only expanding the mind but keeping kids off the streets and out of the correctional system. Studies show{{cn|date=June 2016}} that students with art programs are three times more likely to graduate than those who don't. Art programs give kids somewhere to express themselves if they don't have the support to do that at home, it also gets kid to think creatively and inventively, expanding a kids way of thinking in general. Kids that had access to art programs or afterschool programs had better grades, it allowed them to improve their overall skills in school. All of these things are ways that kids keep from getting "bored" in school and getting in with the wrong crowd. Keeping art programs in schools is an important way to keep our kids safe and smart.{{cn|date=June 2016}}
Professor P Vijayakumar, Chairperson,Centre for Social and Organisational Leadership (C SOL) at Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai,India uses art as a teaching tool extensively in the Organisation Development and Change course for masters students states "Art facilitates reflection. Reflective practice needs to be an integral part of any management education"&lt;ref&gt;Lubna Kably,"Brushing up on HRD through Art,Times of India 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Van-Jones-graph.jpg|thumb|Van Jones - Why is art important?]]
 Van Jones presented a graph that accurately represents the interaction between the four aspects of society and its different members. Consequently, Jones depicts why art is important to our society. Society is driven by the powerful elites, the dependent masses, government, cultural producers and artists. On the left you have action, and on the right, ideas; elites are at the top, and the masses are below. There’s an inside act and an outside act. On the inside, there’s big money: elites are spending millions of dollars to influence politicians and policy makers. The inside act has the power to influence policy creators. On the outside, we at the grassroots set our expectations and needs, so that the elected candidates pass laws that give us power. Masses reflect what society really wants (heart) The left side, “action,” often means quantifiable policy changes. The right side, “ideas,” can be harder to see. We are not necessarily talking about concrete things here, but rather, a “head space.” Academic institutions and think tanks, which are not always involved in the immediate policy wins, are significant in creating a culture of thought. While the left side, “action”, continues to produce quantifiable policy changes and new laws, the right side “ïdeas”, can be hard to quantify its outcome. Although “head” talks theories and academics, it fails to produce any significant contribution to policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;https://theartist.me/art/what-is-art/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University''', ({{lang-fa|دانشگاه شهید مدنی آذربایجان}}) commonly called only ''Azarbaijan University'', is a state university located near [[Tabriz]], [[East Azerbaijan Province]], [[Iran]], founded in 1987. The university provides both undergraduate and graduate education to approximately 7.500 students at a wide range of fields including engineering, basic sciences, literature and theology. The university has got Research Gate's total impact point of 1716.47 from 61 publications, according to the latest statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/login|title=Log in|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Azarbaijan University was founded in 1987 in Tabriz as a branch of Tehran's Tarbiat Moallem (teacher education) University. The initial objective of the university was to train teachers in different area for the fulfillment of Iranian government educational development policies and the major concern of the university was focused on training teachers for high schools and technical schools. On 1988 Azarbaijan University became an independent university under the title ''Tabriz University of Tarbiat Moallem'' and later ''Azarbaijan University of Tarbiat Moallem''. In 2012, due to changing of Iranian educational policies, the university turned to a general educational university under the title ''Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University''. The name "[[Shahid Madani]]" comes from an Iranian cleric from Azarshahr who became a martyr in the early years of [[Islamic Revolution]].

Recently, the university is expanding fast and it is planning to be one of the prominent educational and research centers in Iran. New faculty buildings are being opened, new young academic staff are being employed and a lot of academic activities are underway to convert the university to one of the most dynamic universities in northwestern Iran.

Founded in 1908, the '''Certified General Accountants Association of Canada''' ('''CGA-Canada''') serves [[Certified General Accountant]]s and students in Canada and nearly 100 countries. CGA-Canada established the designation's certification requirements and professional standards, offers professional development, conducts research and advocacy, and represents CGAs nationally and internationally. CGA-Canada is working with the [[Chartered Professional Accountant]]s of Canada (CPA Canada) to integrate operations under the CPA banner in 2014. CPA Canada is the new national accounting body formed by the merger of the [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]] (CICA) and the Society of [[Certified Management Accountant]]s (CMA) in 2013.

In October 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 CGA-Canada was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., CGA-Canada has also been named one of "BC's Top Employers" and one of "Canada's Greenest Employers".

==History==

The national association, first known as the Canadian Accountants' Association, was founded in 1908 by a trio of Canadian Pacific Railway accountants in Montreal, Quebec. Five years later, in 1913, the General Accountants' Association, as it was then known, was granted a charter from the government of Canada. By the mid-1940s, association chapters were established from coast-to-coast. Provincial, territorial and regional (offshore) chapters were later established under their own charters.

Auditing rights are regulated by provincial governments.   In [[Prince Edward Island]], only qualified CAs and CGAs can perform public accounting and auditing in accordance with the Public Accounting and Auditing Act.  In all other provinces, except Quebec and Ontario (detailed below), only qualified CAs, CGAs, and CMAs (Certified Management Accountants) may audit public companies.

*'''1948''' Bilingual origins: Examinations are offered in English and French in Quebec. The move to a bilingual organization is underway.
*'''1950s''' CGA-British Columbia and the University of British Columbia's School of Commerce develop an innovative five-year extension program, available on campus or by correspondence. The program is later adopted in other jurisdictions and becomes a national curriculum standard.
*'''1964''' Education program goes international: The education program is extended to the  Caribbean and Bermuda.
*'''1974''' Code of Ethics enshrined: CGA-Canada approves what would become the Code of Ethical Principles and Rules of Conduct.
*'''1977''' Founding member of IFAC: CGA-Canada becomes a founding member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).
*'''1982''' Name change to  the '''Certified General Accountants Association of Canada'''.
*'''1988''' John Leslie's award: The John Leslie Award is established in honour of the association's founding president and Chair, and recognizes exceptional service.
*'''1987-1991''' Competency-based accounting education: A major revision of the CGA education program is completed. Competency-based objectives, management emphasis and integration of ethics and information technology become hallmarks of the revised program.
*'''1998''' Degree required: CGAs are now required to obtain a bachelor's degree prior to certification. Partnerships are developed with universities to provide distance-learning options.
*'''2003''' Asian links secured: CGA-Hong Kong is granted affiliate status. CGA education materials are offered at more than a dozen Chinese universities.
*'''2013''' Unifying the accounting profession: CGA-Canada entered into an Integration Agreement with CPA Canada, the body responsible for the new national designation [[Chartered Professional Accountant]].
*'''2014''' Unification completes in October 2014.

Historically [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]] only allowed CAs to audit public companies. In 2004, the Ontario government passed legislation that would enable CAs, CGAs and CMAs to practice public accounting under a reconstituted Public Accountants Council, and as of June 2010 Ontario CGAs were allowed to issue audit opinions.

In August 2005, a panel was constituted under the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT) to rule on a challenge filed by CGA New Brunswick and CGA-Canada. It found Quebec's measures denying CGAs the right to practice public accounting in Quebec to impair trade and recommended legislative changes. The Quebec government committed to address the problem. By November 2009, the 'Regulation respecting the public accountancy permit of the Ordre des comptables généraux accrédités du Québec' enabled qualified CGAs to offer the full range of public accounting services to for-profit and publicly listed companies.

On November 6, 2009, Ontario issued a Notice of Measure claiming that material differences exist in respect of the practice of public accounting in Canada and to protect consumers out of province public accountants would be assessed against Ontario's requirements. Manitoba supported by Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan objected on the grounds that the Ontario regime causes injury to CGAs and impairs internal trade. A Panel convened under the Agreement on Internal Trade reviewed submissions and held a public hearing in Toronto on November 29, 2011. The Panel found that Ontario's notice of measure has impaired or would impair internal trade and has caused or would cause injury. The Panel recommended that Ontario comply with its AIT obligations by April 15, 2012. The outcome is important for CGAs because it removes the last barrier to mobility, allowing CGAs to practice anywhere in Canada.

In November 2008, Dr. Catherine Boivie was appointed to the Board of Directors as the Public Representative. Based in British Columbia, Dr. Boivie is the chief executive officer of Inventure Solutions and senior vice-president of information technology (IT) and facilities at Vancity, Canada's largest credit union.

In October 2013, CGA-Canada entered into an Integration Agreement with CPA Canada, the body responsible for the new national designation [[Chartered Professional Accountant]].  This followed most provincial CGA bodies ratifying the unification of the accounting profession in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpacanada.ca/blog/2013/10/09/cpa-canada-welcomes-positive-cga-member-vote-result/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129220319/http://cpacanada.ca/blog/2013/10/09/cpa-canada-welcomes-positive-cga-member-vote-result/ |archivedate=2013-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

CGA-Canada's professional education program is competency-based. Competency-based education requires candidates to perform tasks and roles to standards expected in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cga.org/canada/competency{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The knowledge, skills and professional values required of a CGA are reflected in a list of competencies. These competencies extend over three areas: professionalism, leadership and professional knowledge. They are validated periodically through extensive survey analysis. The CGA Competency Framework details the 130 competencies required of a newly certified CGA.

The complete academic program consists of 19 courses, two business cases, and professional qualification exams, spread over several levels: Levels 1 to 3 (Foundation Studies), Level 4 (Advanced Studies), and final level, the PACE qualification or certification level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cga.org/canada{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CGA must have an undergraduate degree. Students normally require 36 months of supervised work experiences, but in all cases they require a minimum of 24 months. They may meet the experience requirements in any business sector and in a variety of fields.

Before issuing audit opinions a CGA must first be licensed as a public accountant. The requirements for licensing include at least 500 public accounting hours per year.

CGA is recognized in 170+ countries through their partnership with ACCA.

==Online learning==

CGA-Canada has been providing online professional accounting education. Via the Internet, students can complete their studies using a system that integrates text material, study guides, video and audio tools, discussion forums, group case study and project work, web research and email.

Introduced in 2011, Professional Experience Required for Certification (PERC) is the national reporting process for students in the CGA program. With PERC, students can document their experiences online and submit it annually.

In addition to its own online program of studies, CGA-Canada has also developed online degree partnerships with several Canadian universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/Programs/Education/Pages/ca_edu_online_learning.aspx CGA-Canada's website Online learning] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502001327/http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/Programs/Education/Pages/ca_edu_online_learning.aspx |date=May 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

CGA-Canada develops research and supports positions with a view to influence social policy, regulation and standards-setting.

This initiative has resulted in the following research items. [http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/ResearchAndAdvocacy/Pages/_ca_about_research_advocacy_index.aspx]

==Mutual recognition agreements==

In December 2006, CGA-Canada and the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA) announced a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) to take effect on 1 January 2007. This agreement was renewed in 2011.

In April 2008, CGA-Canada and [[CPA Australia]] entered into a MRA to extend the global reach of both organizations into new continents. [http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/OtherDocuments/ca_mra_ad.pdf]

In June 2009, CGA-Canada and CPA Ireland [http://www.cpaireland.ie/] entered into a mutual recognition agreement. The MRA establishes a strategic partnership between the two leading accounting organizations and gives members the opportunity to qualify for another designation. [http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/MediaCentre/CurrentMediaReleases/Pages/ca_mdr_2009-06-03.aspx]

In June 2010, CGA-Canada and the [[Ordre des Experts-Comptables]], France's foremost accounting organization, have entered into a MRA. Under this accord, CGAs and members of the CSOEC can be considered for membership by the other body. [http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/MediaCentre/MediaReleases/CurrentMediaReleases/Pages/ca_mdr_2010-06-28.aspx]

The association is a member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to [[Citrix Systems|Citrix]], a Citrix Technology Professional (CTP) award is given to individuals "who have invested a significant amount of time and resources to become experts in Citrix products and solutions."&lt;ref name="Citrix CTP Program"&gt;{{cite web|title=Citrix Technology Professionals Program|url=https://www.citrix.com/community/ctp/|publisher=Citrix|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;The awardees are those who have shared knowledge and helped Citrix with their community presence.&lt;ref name="Citrix CTP Program"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The CTP program was launched in 2006 with 11 well-known Citrix Community members.&lt;ref name="Citrix launches the CTP program"&gt;{{Cite web
|url= http://www.brianmadden.com/opinion/Citrix-launches-the-Citrix-Technology-Professional-program-their-version-of-the-Microsoft-MVP

|date= 2006-07-17 
|accessdate= 2016-11-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brian Madden's article, [[Citrix Systems|Citrix]] had tried to create a program similar to the [[Microsoft Most Valuable Professional]] program for years.&lt;ref name="Is Citrix MVP Program Dead?"&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Citrix Plans to Create its own MVP Program?"&gt;{{Cite web

|title= Citrix Responds, Plans to Create its own MVP Program
|author= Brian Madden
|publisher= brianmadden.com
|date= 2004-04-22 
|accessdate= 2016-11-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Program was called the "CVP" program but [[Citrix Systems|Citrix]] had killed the program, according to Brian Madden.  The initial members, listed below, first met at BriForum 2006 and the program was born.
The original members were:
Shawn Bass (USA)
Douglas Brown (USA)
Rick Dehlinger (USA)
Jeroen van de Kamp (The Netherlands)
Thomas Koetzing (Germany)
Rick Mack (Australia)
Brian Madden (USA)
Ron Oglesby (USA)
Jeff Pitsch (USA)
Bernhard Tritsch (Germany)
Stefan Vermeulen (The Netherlands)&lt;ref name="Citrix launches the CTP program"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
The CTP program is seen as highly selective since Citrix caps the CTP program to 50 individuals each year.&lt;ref name="Citrix CTP Program"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Applications are taken annually and based on the number of applicants and current CTPs retiring, the number stays at 50 CTPs or less.  Due to the limit, the program allows those who leave to keep the CTP Alumni status, however they are not able to participate or receive the CTP benefits.  CTPs must be non-Citrix employees and not have a conflict of interest from a competing employer or arrangement.

==Benefits==
CTPs are able to participate in road maps and planning for [[Citrix Systems|Citrix]] products and technologies and have access to product managers and other employees at Citrix.  CTPs also speak at Citrix events and promote the company at trade shows, online presence and through demos.  The other benefits include paid attendance at Citrix events. &lt;ref name="Citrix CTP Program"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locating an CTP==
Citrix hosts a site listing all current CTPs to help identify members and also to find their location and expertise.&lt;ref name="CTP Awardees"&gt;{{cite web|title=Citrix Technology Program Awardees|url=https://www.citrix.com/community/ctp/awardees.html|publisher=Citrix|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most CTPs can be contacted via social media tools, especially LinkedIn or Twitter (these are listed on the site).

It is the official journal of the [[British Association for International and Comparative Education]].

Comparative and international studies in education address themes of major interest to policy makers and academics. They illuminate the role of education in development, in maintaining or challenging the existing social order, and the interaction of the local, the national and the global in education systems, institutions and practices. '''''Compare''''' publishes such research as it relates to educational development and change in different parts of the world. It seeks analyses of educational discourse, policy and practice across disciplines, and their implications for teaching, learning and governance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1565">In [[mathematics education]], '''concept image''' and '''concept definition''' are two ways of understanding a mathematical concept.

The terms were introduced by {{Harvtxt|Tall|Vinner|1981}}. They define a concept image as such:
:"We shall use the term ''concept image'' to describe the total cognitive structure that is associated with the concept, which includes all the mental pictures and associated properties and processes. It is built up over the years through experiences of all kinds, changing as the individual meets new stimuli and matures."{{sfn|Tall|Vinner|1981|p=152}}
A concept definition is similar to the usual notion of a [[definition]] in mathematics, with the distinction that it is personal to an individual:
:"a ''personal'' concept definition can differ from a ''formal'' concept definition, the latter being a concept definition which is accepted by the mathematical community at large."{{sfn|Tall|Vinner|1981|p=152}}

'''Cram.com''' (formerly known as '''Flashcard Exchange''') is a free, [[web-based]] application for creating, studying, and sharing [[flashcard]]s.&lt;ref name="Salend112"&gt;{{cite book |title=Classroom Testing and Assessment for ALL Students: Beyond Standardization |last=Salend |first=Spencer J. |year=2009 |publisher=Corwin Press |location=Thousand Oaks, California |isbn=1-4129-6643-4 |page=112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3dcweZPl_kC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=%22Flashcard+Exchange%22 |accessdate=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Users on Cram.com have created over 68 million flashcards.

==History==
Cram.com was launched by [[StudyMode]] after it acquired FlashcardExchange.com and FlashcardDB.com.&lt;ref name="jarvey"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jarvey|first=Natalie|title=West Hollywood Company to Help Students Cram|url=http://labusinessjournal.com/news/2013/sep/19/west-hollywood-company-help-students-cram/|work=Los Angeles Business Journal|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1990&lt;ref name="founded" /&gt; as a non-profit educational foundation and think tank. It was founded as a branch of the [[Hudson Institute]], an Indianapolis-based [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] think tank, and is named after the [[Royal Navy]] ship [[HMS Discovery (1789)|HMS ''Discovery'']] in which [[George Vancouver]] explored [[Puget Sound]] in 1792.&lt;ref name="abriefhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/f/4441 |title=Discovery Institute: A Brief History |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |format=PDF |accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1993, [[Bruce Chapman]], who had previously held various roles as a Republican politician in Seattle and Washington State government, noticed an essay in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' by [[Stephen C. Meyer]] about a dispute when [[biology]] lecturer [[Dean H. Kenyon]] taught intelligent design creationism in introductory classes.&lt;ref name="wilgoren"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilgoren |first=Jodi |date=August 21, 2005 |title=Politicized Scholars Put Evolution on the Defensive |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/national/21evolve.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=24bc7c9b16cac8a8&amp;ex=1282276800&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenyon had co-authored ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'', and in 1993 Meyer had contributed to the teacher's notes for the second edition of ''Pandas''. Meyer was an old friend of Gilder, and over dinner about a year later they formed the idea of a think tank opposed to [[materialism]]. In the summer of 1995, Chapman and Meyer met a representative of [[Howard Ahmanson, Jr.]]; Meyer, who had previously tutored Ahmanson's son in science, recalls being asked "What could you do if you had some financial backing?" In 1996, the promise of $750,000 over three years from the Ahmansons and a smaller grant from the conservative Maclellan Foundation was used to fund the Institute's [[Center for Science and Culture|Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture]], which went on to form the motive force behind the [[intelligent design movement]].&lt;ref name="wilgoren" /&gt; In 2002, the name was changed to the Center for Science and Culture.&lt;ref name="wedging"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forrest |first1=Barbara |last2=Branch |first2=Glenn |authorlink2=Glenn Branch |date=January–February 2005 |title=Wedging Creationism into the Academy |url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/academe/2005/JF/Feat/forr.htm |journal=Academe |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[American Association of University Professors]] |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=36–41 |issn=0190-2946 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729032153/http://aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/academe/2005/JF/Feat/forr.htm |archivedate=July 29, 2007 |accessdate=August 27, 2007 |doi=10.2307/40252735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center for Science and Culture===
The [[Center for Science and Culture]] (CSC), formerly known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture (CRSC), is a subsidiary of the Discovery Institute. It was established in 1996 with the assistance of [[Phillip E. Johnson]] to advance the wedge strategy. Bruce Chapman calls the CRSC "our No. 1 project."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pennock 2001|Forrest 2001]], [http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Wedge.cfm "The Wedge at Work: How Intelligent Design Creationism Is Wedging Its Way into the Cultural and Academic Mainstream"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CSC offers fellowships of up to $60,000 a year for "support of significant and original research in the natural sciences, the history and philosophy of science, cognitive science and related fields." Since its founding in 1996, the Institute's CSC has spent 39 percent of its $9.3 million on research according to Meyer, underwriting books or papers, or often just paying universities to release professors from some teaching responsibilities so that they can work on intelligent design related scholarship. Over those nine years, $792,585 financed laboratory or field research in biology, paleontology or biophysics, while $93,828 helped graduate students in paleontology, linguistics, history and philosophy. The CSC lobbies aggressively to policymakers for wider acceptance of intelligent design and against the theory of evolution and what it terms "[[Metaphysical naturalism|scientific materialism]]." To that end, the CSC works to advance a policy it terms the Wedge strategy, of which the "Teach the Controversy" campaign is a major component. The "Teach the Controversy" strategy was announced by Meyer in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Meyer.cfm |title=Meyer's Hopeless Monster |last1=Gishlick |first1=Alan |last2=Matzke |first2=Nick |last3=Elsberry |first3=Wesley R. |authorlink3=Wesley R.

===Biologic Institute===
{{main|Biologic Institute}}
In 2005, the Discovery Institute provided the funding to set up the Biologic Institute in [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]] and the [[Fremont, Seattle|Fremont]] district of Seattle, Washington, headed by Douglas Axe. The Biologic Institute claims to conduct research into intelligent design in response to one of the primary criticisms of intelligent design that there is no valid research conducted by the scientific community on the topic. According to Axe, the lab's main objective "is to show that the design perspective can lead to better science," and will "contribute substantially to the scientific case for intelligent design."&lt;ref name="god_lab"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Biever |first=Celeste |date=December 15, 2006 |title=Intelligent design: The God Lab |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225824.000-intelligent-design-the-god-lab.html |journal=[[New Scientist]] |location=London |issue=2582 |pages=8–11 |issn=0262-4079 |accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologic's staff consists of at least three researchers: Axe, the senior researcher; [[Zoology|zoologist]] Ann Gauger, who like Axe is a signatory to the Discovery Institute's petition expressing skepticism towards "Darwinian theory" entitled "[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]]"; and Brendan Dixon, a software developer.&lt;ref name="god_lab" /&gt; In keeping with the Discovery Institute's October 2006 statement that intelligent design research is being conducted by the Institute in secret to avoid the scrutiny of the scientific community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/10/the_state_of_scientific_resear002669.html |title=The State of Scientific Research on Intelligent Design |last=Chapman |first=Bruce |date=October 2, 2006 |website=Evolution News &amp; Views |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idthefuture.com/2006/08/from_a_senior_scientist_observ.html |title=From A Senior Scientist Observing the ID Debate |last=Nelson |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Nelson (creationist) |date=August 3, 2006 |website=Intelligent Design the Future |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060805205557/http://www.idthefuture.com/2006/08/from_a_senior_scientist_observ.html |archivedate=August 5, 2006 |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; both Axe and Discovery Institute spokesperson Rob Crowther portray it as a "separate entity" despite being funded by the Discovery Institute.&lt;ref name="god_lab" /&gt;

Previously serving as a director of the Biologic Institute was George Weber, who is also a member of the local chapter of the creationist group [[Reasons To Believe]]. In an interview he stated that the lab is a wing of the Discovery Institute and that their goal is to "challenge the scientific community on naturalism" and "What we are doing is necessary to move ID along" which led to his dismissal from the board of the Institute.&lt;ref name="god_lab" /&gt;

[[PZ Myers]] likens the Biologic Institute's design research program to [[cargo cult]]s, with "Intelligent Design creationists pretend[ing] that they're doing science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/02/happy_intelligent_design_day.php |title=Happy Intelligent Design Day! |last=Myers |first=PZ |authorlink=PZ Myers |date=February 15, 2007 |website=[[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]] |publisher=[[ScienceBlogs|ScienceBlogs LLC]] |type=Blog |accessdate=June 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018063039/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/02/happy_intelligent_design_day.php |archivedate=October 18, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The Discovery Institute through the Center for Science and Culture has been involved in the intelligent design movement; transportation in the [[United States|American]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] northwest ([[Pacific Northwest|Cascadia]]); a bioethics program opposed to [[assisted suicide]], [[euthanasia]], [[Embryonic stem cell|embryonic stem cell research]], human genetic manipulation, [[human cloning]], and the [[animal rights movement]]. Its economics and legal programs advocate [[tort]] reform, lower [[tax]]ation, and reduced economic regulation of individuals and groups as the best economic policy. The Discovery Institute also maintains a foreign policy program currently focused on [[Russia]] and [[East Asia]].

The Institute's primary thrust in terms of funding and resources dedicated are those political and cultural campaigns centering on intelligent design. These include the:
* [[Wedge strategy]]
* [[Intelligent design movement]]
* [[Teach the Controversy]]

===Intelligent design and Teach the Controversy===
{{further|Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns}}
The Discovery Institute's main thrust has been to promote intelligent design politically to the public, education officials and public policymakers, and to portray evolution as a "theory in crisis" and advocating teachers to "Teach the Controversy" through the [[Center for Science and Culture|CSC]]. It has employed a number of specific political strategies and tactics in the furtherance of its goals. These range from attempts at the state level to undermine or remove altogether the presence of evolutionary theory from the public school classroom, to having the federal government mandate the teaching of intelligent design, to 'stacking' municipal, county and state school boards with ID proponents. The Discovery Institute has been a significant player in many of these cases, through the CSC providing a range of support from material assistance to federal, state and regional elected representatives in the drafting of bills to supporting and advising individual parents confronting their school boards.

Some of the political battles which have involved the Discovery Institute include:
* [[Kansas evolution hearings]]
* [[Santorum Amendment]]
* ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' — the [[Dover, Pennsylvania]], intelligent design controversy

In 2004, the Institute opened an office in [[Washington, D.C.]], and in 2005 the Discovery Institute hired [[Creative Response Concepts]], the same [[public relations]] firm to promote its intelligent design campaign that promoted the [[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth|Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]] campaign, the [[Republican National Committee]], the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]], and the [[Contract with America]]. Creative Response Concepts scored an early victory for the Institute in getting ''[[The New York Times]]'' to publish an essay by [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Christoph Schönborn|Cardinal Christoph Schönborn]], archbishop of Vienna, condemning [[neo-Darwinism]] and [[positivism]]. The essay, "Finding Design in Nature,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schönborn |first=Christoph |authorlink=Christoph Schönborn |date=July 7, 2005 |title=Finding Design in Nature |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/opinion/07schonborn.html |newspaper=The New York Times |type=op-ed |accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; submitted directly to ''The New York Times'' by Creative Response Concepts, was prompted by the Institute's vice president Mark Ryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dean |first1=Cornelia |last2=Goodstein |first2=Laurie |date=July 9, 2005 |title=Leading Cardinal Redefines Church's View on Evolution |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/09/science/09cardinal.html?ex=1278561600&amp;en=0c183426986e5e77&amp;ei=5089&amp;partner=rssyahoo&amp;emc=rss |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' (2005), the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]] found:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The proper application of both the endorsement and [[Lemon v. Kurtzman#Lemon test|Lemon tests]] to the facts of this case makes it abundantly clear that the [[Dover Area School District|Board]]'s ID Policy violates the [[Establishment Clause]]. In making this determination, we have addressed the seminal question of whether ID is science. We have concluded that it is not, and moreover that ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents.&lt;ref name="kitzmiller_pg136"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v.

This federal court—along with [[List of scientific societies explicitly rejecting intelligent design|the majority of scientific organizations]], including the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]—say that the Institute has manufactured the controversy they want to teach by promoting a false perception that evolution is "a theory in crisis"&lt;ref name="Saletan" /&gt;{{according to whom|date=July 2017}} through incorrectly claiming that it is the subject of wide controversy and debate within the [[scientific community]].&lt;ref name="kitzmiller_pg89"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v.

Discovery Institute's Cascadia Center for Regional Development (formerly the Cascadia Project) focuses on regional transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cascadiacenter.org/about.php |title=About the Cascadia Center |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=The Cascadia Center |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cascadia Project started in 1992 with Bruce Agnew, former Chief of Staff for U.S. Representative [[John Miller (Washington politician)|John Miller]], serving as the director.

==Controversy==

===Religious agenda===
Although it often describes itself as a secular organization, critics describe the Discovery Institute as a Christian organization, and point to the Institute's own publications and the statements of its members that endorse a religious ideology. [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] wrote, "Though the Discovery Institute describes itself as a think tank 'specializing in national and international affairs,' the group's real purpose is to undercut church-state separation and turn public schools into religious indoctrination centers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benen |first=Steve |authorlink=Steve Benen |date=May 2002 |title=The Discovery Institute |url=https://www.au.org/church-state/may-2002-church-state/featured/the-discovery-institute |journal=Church &amp; State |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Americans United for Separation of Church and State |issn=2163-3746 |accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States district court|U.S. District Court Judge]] [[John E. Jones III]] concluded in ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', "The CSRC expressly announces, in the [[Wedge strategy#Wedge Document|Wedge Document]], a program of Christian apologetics to promote ID. A careful review of the Wedge Document's goals and language throughout the document reveals cultural and religious goals, as opposed to scientific ones."&lt;ref name="kitzmiller_pg29"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v.

Some critics have contended the Institute has run an organized campaign to mask or downplay its religious origins and agenda. They point to the Discovery Institute's renaming of its ''Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture'' to ''Center for Science and Culture'' in 2002 to avoid religious overtones implied with trying to "renew" society.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} They{{who|date=July 2017}} claim the name change "followed hard on the heels of accusations that the center's real interest was not science but reforming culture along lines favored by conservative Christians."&lt;ref name="wedging" /&gt; Observers of the Institute{{who|date=July 2017}} also point to the fact that the Discovery Institute's members are largely outspoken Christians,&lt;ref name="wilgoren" /&gt; who are promoting an explicitly Christian agenda,&lt;ref name="wedge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf |title=The Wedge |year=1999 |publisher=Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture |location=Seattle, WA |format=PDF |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; funded largely by  Christian conservatives, catering to an almost exclusively Christian constituency.&lt;ref name="wedge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="discover_mag"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kruglinski |first=Susan |date=December 22, 2005 |title=Intelligent Decision |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2005/dec/intelligent-design/?searchterm=intelligent%20decision |journal=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |location=Waukesha, WI |publisher=Kalmbach Publishing |issn=0274-7529 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921144953/http://discovermagazine.com/2005/dec/intelligent-design/?searchterm=intelligent%20decision |archivedate=September 21, 2011 |accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://austringer.net/files/csicop2002/wre_desinf_csicop_15min_trim.ppt |title=Beyond the 'Wedge': Intelligent Design, Science, and Culture |last=Elsberry |first=Wesley R. |format=Microsoft PowerPoint |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Discovery Institute also has [[Jewish]]&lt;ref name=Judaism&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/Science/Creationism_and_Evolution/ID_Prn.shtml |title=Judaism &amp; Intelligent Design |last=Kippley-Ogman |first=Emma |publisher=MyJewishLearning.com |location=New York |accessdate=November 13, 2010 |quote=But there are also Jewish voices in the intelligent design camp.

He is not a Christian and sometimes even identifies himself as 'a Jewish agnostic.' In an interview, he has admitted: 'I have no religious convictions and no religious beliefs. What I do believe is that theology is no more an impossible achievement than mathematics.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'' article concluded that behind all Discovery Institute programs there was an underlying hidden religious agenda:
{{quote|"Yet the Discovery Institute as an organization didn't get involved in the issue in order to solve the mysteries of the universe. Chapman is up front about having a social and political agenda. He sees design intelligence as a way to combat the growing reliance on genetic explanations for human behavior and what he sees as an undermining of personal responsibility. As an example of this phenomena, Chapman cites the infamous 'Twinkie defense' used by a murder defendant claiming his sugar high made him do it.

Others associated with the institute take a bigger leap of logic to argue that welfare, as currently dispensed, is a misguided consequence of the Darwinian outlook. 'If you see human beings as nothing but matter and motion, than {{sic}} all you do is treat them like mouths to feed,' says Jay Richards, program director for the institute's Center for Science and Culture. 'If they're more than that, you treat the whole person,' he argues, which would mean looking at such things as family structure and the role of moral and religious values in their lives.

Do you really have to attack a whole branch of science in order to counter liberal views on welfare? The Discovery Institute folk think they do.

In the summer of 2000, Chapman advised a breakaway faction of Episcopalians opposed to the ordination of gays on how to fund their desired [[schism (religion)|schism]] from the mainline denomination and suggested that funds from multi-millionaire and Institute board member Howard Ahmanson, Jr., who was also a fellow Episcopalian, might be available for this task. In a memo Chapman sent to fellow dissident Episcopalians, he stated that for their campaign to succeed fund-raising was critical, but "is going to be affected directly by whether we have a clear, compelling forward strategy" and "the Ahmansons are only going to be available to us if we have such a strategy and I think it would be wise to involve them directly in settling on it...."&lt;ref name="salon_ahmanson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2004/01/06/ahmanson/ |title=Avenging angel of the religious right |last=Blumenthal |first=Max |authorlink=Max Blumenthal |date=January 6, 2004 |website=Salon |location=San Francisco, CA  |accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 and 2001, Chapman was successful in securing more than $1 million from Ahmanson for the [[American Anglican Council]], but is no longer personally involved in the schism in the American Episcopal community; Chapman converted to Catholicism in 2002.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Creation science and intelligent design===
&lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE: "cdesign proponentsists" is a DIRECT QUOTE from the book. PLEASE DO NOT 'CORRECT' IT! The mistake was in the book itself, not the article --&gt;

The issue began when some proponents of intelligent design associated with ''Pandas'' found a need to distinguish it from [[creation science]], whose teaching in public science class had been negated as a violation of the Establishment Clause by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' (1987).

An early contributor to ''Pandas'', CSC Fellow [[Charles Thaxton]] proposed a term to replace ''creation science'', which he "picked up from a NASA scientist"—intelligent design.&lt;ref name="BirthIntelligentDesignTheory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://debunkcreationscience.hostse.com/designhistory.htm |title=The Birth of Intelligent Design Theory |last=Flack |first=Lenny |year=2006 |website=Creation 'Science' Debunked |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720094609/http://debunkcreationscience.hostse.com/designhistory.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a new draft of ''Pandas'', approximately 150 uses of the root word "creation," such as "creationism" and "creationist," were systematically changed to refer to "intelligent design."&lt;ref name="kitzmiller_pg31–33"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v.

Following pattern, the term "creationists" was quietly changed to "design proponents," but in one telling case, the beginning and end of the original word "creationists" were accidentally retained, so that "creationists" became "[[Of Pandas and People#Pandas and "cdesign proponentsists"|cdesign proponentsists]]."&lt;!--this misspelling is NOT a mistake, it's a direct quote--&gt;&lt;ref name="CdesignProponentsistsNCSE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/creationism/legal/cdesign-proponentsists |title=Cdesign Proponentsists |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 25, 2008 |website=[[National Center for Science Education]] |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |type=Blog |accessdate=December 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof that intelligent design was creationism re-labeled played a significant part in the Kitzmiller trial, and "cdesign proponentsists" has been described by [[Nick Matzke]] as "the 'missing link' between creationism and intelligent design."&lt;ref name=judgmentdaytranscript&gt;{{cite episode |title=Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial |episodelink=Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/intelligent-design-trial.html |accessdate=May 5, 2014 |series=[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]] |last1=Johnstone |first1=Gary (Director) |last2=McMaster |first2=Joseph (Director) |network=[[PBS]] |date=November 13, 2007 |season=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peer-reviewed publications====
The Discovery Institute maintains a list of what it claims are peer-reviewed publications supporting intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/a/2640 |title=Peer-Reviewed &amp; Peer-Edited Scientific Publications Supporting the Theory of Intelligent Design (Annotated) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=February 1, 2012 |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Isaak of [[TalkOrigins Archive]] responded to the list by saying, "Even by the most generous criteria, the peer-reviewed scientific output from the intelligent design (ID) movement is very low, especially considering the long history and generous funding of the movement...One week's worth of peer-reviewed papers on evolutionary biology exceeds the entire history of ID peer-review."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CI/CI001_4.html |title=CI001.4:  Intelligent Design and peer review |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Misrepresentation of agenda====
At the foundation of most criticism of the Discovery Institute is the charge that the Institute and its Center for Science and Culture intentionally misrepresent or omit many important facts in promoting their agenda. [[Intellectual honesty|Intellectual dishonesty]], in the form of misleading impressions created by the use of rhetoric, intentional ambiguity, and misrepresented evidence, form the foundation of most of the criticisms of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenhouse |first=Jason |authorlink=Jason Rosenhouse |date=January 2003 |title=Leaders and Followers in the Intelligent-Design Movement |url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/1/6.full |journal=[[BioScience]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] on behalf of the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=6–7 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[0006:LAFITI]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0006-3568 |accessdate=May 5, 2014 |quote=ID supporters present fallacious arguments, use dishonest rhetoric, and often present non-contemptuous responses as evidence that their theories are gaining acceptance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drum |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Drum |date=March 24, 2004 |title=Intelligent Design |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_03/003541.php |work=Political Animal |type=Blog |location=Washington, D.C.  |issn=0043-0633 |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is alleged that its goal is to lead an unwary public to reach certain conclusions, and that many have been  deceived as a result. Its critics, such as [[Eugenie Scott]], [[Robert T. Pennock]], [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Barbara Forrest]], claim that the Discovery Institute knowingly misquotes scientists and other experts, deceptively omits contextual text through [[ellipsis]], and makes unsupported amplifications of relationships and credentials, and are often said to claim support from scientists when no such support exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bcseweb.org.uk/index.php/Main/WhoIsWho |title=Who's Who in the UK creationist movements: Intelligent Design Advocates in Academia |website=[[British Centre for Science Education]] |accessdate=May 5, 2014 |quote=The proponents of Intelligent Design (and creationism) are notorious for claiming support from scientists when no such support exists.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide spectrum of critics level this charge; from educators, scientists, and the [[Smithsonian Institution]], to individuals who oppose the teaching of creationism alongside science on ideological grounds.

This criticism is not limited to those in the scientific community that oppose the teaching of intelligent design and the suppression of evolution, but also includes former Discovery Institute donors. The [[Bullitt Foundation]], which gave $10,000 in 2001 for transportation causes, withdrew all funding of the Institute; its director, [[Denis Hayes]], called the Institute "the institutional love child of [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Jerry Falwell]]," and said, "I can think of no circumstances in which the Bullitt Foundation would fund anything at Discovery today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/articles/display/The_Glue_that_Binds_the_Movement |title=The Glue that Binds the Movement |last=Flynn |first=Michael |date=September 8, 2005 |website=IRC Right Web |location=Silver City, NM |publisher=[[International Relations Center]] |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wedge Document, a widely circulated 1998 fund-raising document, laid out Discovery's original, ambitious plan to "drive a wedge" into the heart of "scientific materialism," "thereby divorcing science from its purely observational and naturalistic methodology and reversing the deleterious effects of evolution on Western culture."&lt;ref name="Mooney_2002" /&gt; The Wedge Document states two "Governing Goals":
* "To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies."
* "To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God."&lt;ref name="wedge" /&gt;

Meyer says that the Wedge Document "was stolen from our offices and placed on the Web without permission."&lt;ref name="Mooney_2002" /&gt; The central item of this agenda — establishing intelligent design as legitimate science through conducting actual scientific research — has not been achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v.

[[Michelle Goldberg]] has said:
{{quote|"... the Center for Science and Culture takes creationism and tries to legitimize it in scientific terms, and make it sound as if it's really just a competing scientific theory. It hires people with a lot of impressive degrees, although, in many cases, they got the degrees specifically with the idea of using them to discredit Darwinism for religious reasons. It'll put someone forward like [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]], who has a Ph.D. from Berkeley, and yet here he is, defending intelligent design. So they've given a lot of thought to packaging intelligent design to make it seem like legitimate science. And they've given a lot of thought to how to try to infiltrate their ideas into the culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Goldberg |first=Michelle |authorlink=Michelle Goldberg |interviewer=Mark Karlin |title=Michelle Goldberg's Gone To the MegaChurch and She Found Christian Nationalism There |url=http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/06/06/int06020.html |website=BuzzFlash.com |date=June 1, 2006 |location=Sacramento, CA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060612220059/http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/06/06/int06020.html |archivedate=June 12, 2006 |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===John Templeton Foundation===
According to an article in ''The New York Times'', the [[John Templeton Foundation]], who provided grants for conferences and courses to debate intelligent design, later asked intelligent design proponents to submit proposals for actual research. Charles L. Harper Jr., senior vice president at the Templeton Foundation, was quoted as saying "They never came in."  He also said that while he was skeptical from the beginning, other foundation officials were initially intrigued and later grew disillusioned. "From the point of view of [[rigour|rigor]] and intellectual seriousness, the intelligent design people don't come out very well in our world of scientific review," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goodstein |first=Laurie |date=December 4, 2005 |title=Intelligent Design Might Be Meeting Its Maker |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/weekinreview/04good.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Templeton Foundation has since rejected the Discovery Institute's entreaties for more funding, Harper states. "They're political - that for us is problematic," and that while Discovery has "always claimed to be focused on the science," "what I see is much more focused on public policy, on public persuasion, on educational advocacy and so forth."&lt;ref name="wilgoren" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.templeton.org/topics_in_the_news/Statement_Anti_Evolutionism.pdf |title=Anti-Evolutionism |publisher=[[John Templeton Foundation]] |location=West Conshohocken, PA |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051212214558/http://www.templeton.org/topics_in_the_news/Statement_Anti_Evolutionism.pdf |archivedate=December 12, 2005 |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, in a letter to the editor of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Pamela Thompson, Vice President for Communications of the Templeton Foundation, wrote "We do not believe that the science underpinning the intelligent-design movement is sound, we do not support research or programs that deny large areas of well-documented scientific knowledge, and the foundation is a nonpolitical entity and does not engage in or support political movements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Pamela |date=February 4, 2007 |title=Stance is misconstrued on 'intelligent design' |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/04/business/fi-letters4.2 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |type=[[Letter to the editor]] |location=Chicago, IL  |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Wall Street Journal'' also published a letter from Thompson making much the same point: "The foundation doesn't support the political movement known as 'Intelligent Design.' This is for three reasons: We don't believe the science underpinning the 'Intelligent Design' movement is sound, we don't support research or programs that deny large areas of well-documented scientific knowledge and the foundation is a non-political entity and does not engage in, or support, political movements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Pamela |date=February 5, 2007 |title=We Don't Support 'Intelligent Design' |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB117064306043797922 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |type=Letter to the editor |location=New York |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, the Discovery Institute began to counter the unfavorable statements of Harper and Thompson citing a "report" published on the intelligent design [[wiki]] ResearchID.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/02/uncommondescent_and_researchid003249.html |title=UncommonDescent and ResearchID.org Report: ''New York Times'' Falsely Claimed ID Theorists Failed to Respond to Call for Research Proposals |last=Smith |first=Anika |date=February 28, 2007 |website=Evolution News &amp; Views |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report by Joseph C. Campana quoted clarifications from Charles Harper of the Templeton Foundation denouncing intelligent design and distancing the Templeton Foundation from the intelligent design movement, notably a clarification by Harper that ''The Wall Street Journal'' article published "false information" that "mention[ed] the John Templeton Foundation in a way suggesting that the Foundation has been a concerted patron and sponsor of the so-called Intelligent Design ("ID") position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.templeton.org/newsroom/Intelligent_Design/Official_Statement.html |title=Official statement on the false and misleading information published in the Wall Street Journal November 14 |last=Harper |first=Charles L., Jr. |publisher=John Templeton Foundation |location=West Conshohocken, PA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208104648/http://www.templeton.org/newsroom/Intelligent_Design/Official_Statement.html |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campana claimed that this was indicative of larger errors and bias: "The media has misrepresented the record of the intelligent design research community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.researchintelligentdesign.org/wiki/Media_Misreports_Intelligent_Design_Research_and_the_John_Templeton_Foundation |title=Media Misreports Intelligent Design Research and the John Templeton Foundation |last=Campana |first=Joseph C. |date=February 27, 2007 |publisher=ResearchID.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303120912/http://www.researchintelligentdesign.org/wiki/Media_Misreports_Intelligent_Design_Research_and_the_John_Templeton_Foundation#_note-5 |archivedate=March 3, 2007 |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of intelligent design responded by noting that though Harper appears to have "confirmed that while the first statement about a formal call for applications was false, the real point of the article, that ID advocates don't do very well in terms of actual research and scientific review, remains true and valid" a point the Discovery Institute glosses over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2007/03/01/the-iders-who-went-up-a-molehi-1/#more |title=The IDers Who Went Up a Molehill and Came Down a Mountain |last=Brayton |first=Ed |date=March 1, 2007 |website=Dispatches from the Creation Wars |publisher=[[ScienceBlogs|ScienceBlogs LLC]] |type=Blog |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Templeton Foundation posted a response to the Discovery Institute's campaign, saying:
{{quote|In response to errors and misrepresentations stated in the February 28, 2007 ResearchID.org blog post:
1. The John Templeton Foundation has never made a call-for-proposals to the ID Community.&lt;br&gt;
2. The [[Henry F. Schaefer, III|Henry Schaefer]] grant was from the Origins of Biological Complexity program. Schaefer is a world's leading chemist, and his research has nothing whatsoever to do with ID.&lt;br&gt;
3. [[William A. Dembski|Bill Dembski]]'s grant was not for the book "Free Lunch". Dembski was given funds to write another book on Orthodox Theology, which was not on ID, however he has never written the book.

From our FAQ...

Does the Foundation support I.D.?

No. We do not support the political movement known as "Intelligent Design." This is for three reasons 1) we do not believe the science underpinning the "Intelligent Design" movement is sound, 2) we do not support research or programs that deny large areas of well-documented scientific knowledge, and 3) the Foundation is a non-political entity and does not engage in, or support, political movements.

It is important to note that in the past we have given grants to scientists who have gone on to identify themselves as members of the Intelligent Design community. We understand that this could be misconstrued by some to suggest that we implicitly support the Intelligent Design movement, but, as outlined above, this was not our intention at the time nor is it today. -- John Templeton Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.templeton.org/newsroom/Intelligent_Design/ |title=News Room : Intelligent Design |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=John Templeton Foundation |location=West Conshohocken, PA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118052353/http://www.templeton.org/newsroom/Intelligent_Design/ |archivedate=January 18, 2010 |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Kitzmiller'' findings of fact===
{{main|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District}}
In December 2006 the Discovery Institute and its fellows published several articles describing a study performed by the Discovery Institute criticizing the judge in the ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'' trial. It claims that "90.9% (or 5,458 words) of [[John E. Jones III|Judge Jones]]' 6,004-word section on intelligent design as science was taken verbatim or virtually verbatim from the proposed 'Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law' submitted to Judge Jones by [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] attorneys nearly a month before his ruling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=1186 |title=A Comparison of Judge Jones' Opinion in ''Kitzmiller v. Dover'' with Plaintiffs' 'Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law' |last1=West |first=John G. |last2=DeWolf |first2=David K. |date=December 12, 2006 |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |format=PDF |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a day, the president of the York County Bar Association, Sara Austin, wrote that parties are required by the courts to submit findings of fact and "a judge can adopt some, all or none of the proposed findings." She added that in the final ruling, a judge's decision "is the judge's findings and it doesn't matter who submitted them." A partner in a York, Pennsylvania, law firm, James D. Greenberg, said that "Any attempt to make a stink out of it is absurd."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Rick |date=December 13, 2006 |title=Judges' wording often borrowed |url=http://www.ydr.com/doverwestyork/ci_4830900 |newspaper=[[York Daily Record]] |location=Denver, CO |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several commentators described a number of critical flaws in the study from both a numerical and legal standpoint. [[Witold Walczak]], legal director for the ACLU of Pennsylvania and the ACLU's lead attorney on the case called the Institute's report a stunt: "They're getting no traction in the scientific world so they're trying to do something ... as a PR stunt to get attention, ... That's not how scientists work, ... Discovery Institute is trying to litigate a year-old case in the media." He also said the Discovery Institute staff is not, as it claims, interested in finding scientific truths; it is more interested in a "cultural war," pushing for intelligent design and publicly criticizing a judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kauffman |first=Christina |date=December 12, 2006 |title=New criticism for Dover intelligent design ruling |url=http://www.yorkdispatch.com/local/ci_4825206 |newspaper=[[The York Dispatch]] |location=Denver, CO |accessdate=May 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217031633/http://www.yorkdispatch.com/local/ci_4825206 |archivedate=December 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent review of the study performed by [[Wesley R. Elsberry]], author of the text comparison program that was partly responsible for the decision in the case, indicated that only 38% of the complete ruling by Judge Jones actually incorporated the findings of fact and conclusions of law that the plaintiffs proposed that he incorporate, and only 66% of the section (on whether intelligent design was science) incorporated the proposals, not the 90.9% the Discovery Institute claimed was copied in that section. Significantly, Judge Jones adopted only 48% of the plaintiffs's proposed findings of fact for that section, and rejected 52%, clearly showing that he did not accept the section verbatim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vangogh.fdisk.net/~welsberr/kvd/ |title=Text Comparison |last=Elsberry |first=Wesley R. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215205204/http://vangogh.fdisk.net/~welsberr/kvd/ |archivedate=December 15, 2012 |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://austringer.net/wp/index.php/2007/01/31/jones-luskin-and-text/ |title=Jones, Luskin, and Text |last=Elsberry |first=Wesley R. |date=January 31, 2007 |website=[[Wesley R.

==Funding==
{{update|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- all sources for this section are before 2005, should either update them or change to past tense --&gt;
The Institute is a non-profit educational foundation funded by philanthropic foundation grants, corporate and individual contributions and the dues of Institute members. Contributions made to it are tax deductible, as provided by law.

The Institute does not provide details about its backers, out of harassment fears according to Bruce Chapman.&lt;ref name="wilgoren" /&gt;

In 2001, the [[Baptist Press]] reported, "Discovery Institute ... with its $4 million annual budget ($1.2 million of which is for the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture) is heavily funded by [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christians]]. Maclellan Foundation of Chattanooga, Tenn., for example, awarded $350,000 to the institute with the hope researchers would be able to prove evolution to be a false theory. Fieldstead &amp; Co., owned by Howard and Robert Ahmanson of Irvine, Calif., pledged $2.8 million through 2003 to support the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baptist2baptist.net/b2barticle.asp?ID=147 |title=Discovery Institute emerging as force in creation, public policy |last=Willoughby |first=Karen L. |date=May 15, 2001 |website=Baptist2Baptist |publisher=[[Baptist Press]]; [[Southern Baptist Convention#Organization|Executive Committee Southern Baptist Convention]] |location=Nashville, TN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030927223709/http://www.baptist2baptist.net/b2barticle.asp?ID=147 |archivedate=September 27, 2003 |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a review of tax documents on [[GuideStar]] showed grants and gifts totalling $1.4 million in 1997. Included in the supporters were 22 foundations. At least two-thirds of these foundations stated explicitly religious missions.&lt;ref name="guidestar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/91-1521697/discovery-institute.aspx |title=Nonprofit Report for DISCOVERY INSTITUTE |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=[[GuideStar]] |publisher=GuideStar USA, Inc. |location=Williamsburg, VA; Washington, D.C. |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Discovery Institute donors have also contributed significantly to the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|Bush campaign]].&lt;ref name="wilgoren" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salon_ahmanson" /&gt;

In 2005, the ''Washington Post'' reported, "Meyer said the institute accepts money from such wealthy conservatives as Howard Ahmanson Jr., who once said his goal is 'the total integration of biblical law into our lives,' and the Maclellan Foundation, which commits itself to 'the infallibility of the Scripture.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Slevin |first=Peter |date=March 14, 2005 |title=Battle on Teaching Evolution Sharpens |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32444-2005Mar13.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A01 |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Charity Navigator]], in [[fiscal year|FYE]] December 2005, the Discovery Institute had $2,989,608 in total revenue and $3,878,186 in total functional expenses.&lt;ref name="charitynavigator.org_2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=9757 |title=Charity Navigator Rating - Discovery Institute |&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Charity Navigator |publisher=Charity Navigator |location=Glen Rock, NJ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521185505/http://charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=9757 |archivedate=May 21, 2007 |accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Discovery Institute denies allegations that its intelligent design agenda is religious, and downplays the religious source of much of its funding. In an interview of [[Stephen C. Meyer]], when [[ABC News]] asked about the Discovery Institute's many evangelical Christian donors, the Institute's public relations representative stopped the interview saying "I don't think we want to go down that path."&lt;ref name="abc_wnt" /&gt;

Though in the minority, funding also comes from non-conservative sources:  The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation gave $1 million in 2000 and pledged $9.35 million over 10 years in 2003, including $50,000 of Bruce Chapman's $141,000 annual salary. The money of the Gates Foundation grant is "exclusive to the Cascadia project" on regional transportation, according to a Gates Foundation grant maker.&lt;ref name="wilgoren" /&gt;

Published reports state that the Institute has awarded $3.6 million in fellowships of $5,000 to $60,000 per year to 50 researchers since the CSC's founding in 1996.&lt;ref name="wilgoren" /&gt; "I was one of the early beneficiaries of Discovery largess," says William A. Dembski, who, during the three years after completing graduate school in 1996 could not secure a university position, received what he calls "a standard academic salary" of $40,000 per year through the Institute.
&lt;/div&gt;
==Discovery Institute Press==
Discovery Institute Press is the Institute's publishing arm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discoveryinstitutepress.com |title=Discovery Institute Press |website=Discovery Institute Press |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has published intelligent design books by its fellows including [[David Berlinski]]'s ''Deniable Darwin &amp; Other Essays'' (2010), Jonathan Wells' ''The Myth of Junk DNA'' (2011) and an edited volume titled ''Signature Of Controversy'', which contains apologetic works in defense of the Institute's Center for Science and Culture director Stephen C.

'''EAGLES Academy Central High School''' (also known as '''EAGLES Academy Hollywood''' and '''EAGLES Center''') was a [[secondary education|public high school]] located in Hollywood, Los Angeles, with the target group of but not limited to gay, lesbian, [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] young people, as well as those [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] their sexuality and [[Dropping out|educational dropouts]]. It was founded and opened in 1992 along with the "Educational Options" program by the LAUSD and closed down in 2004. It was the first public high school designed for [[LGBT|LGBT youth]] from grade 7 onwards in the United States.

==History==
EAGLES Academy Central High School was a public high school run by the department of "Educational Options" of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), also known as EAGLES Academy Hollywood and EAGLLES Center.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lausd.scriborder.com/startOrderSchool/CA/Los%20Angeles%20Unified%20School%20District/EAGLES%20ACADEMY%20%20%20HOLLYWOOD Entry] on the LAUSD website.

The school was supervised by Ruben Zacarias, in that time period LAUSD's superintendent of schools in charge, Elizabeth Newman, the options administrator, and Sunshine S. Sepulveda, an educational advisor to LAUSD. Founder and principal of the school was Jerry B. Battey, an English teacher, from 1992 to 2004.&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt;

In 1996, the school had two campusses: Hollywood and a [[branch]] located in [[South Bay, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="Press" /&gt;

In 1999, eleven teachers worked at EAGLES.&lt;ref name="CalArts" /&gt;

In the same year, there were also one full-time and four [[Part-time contract|part-time]] [[Volunteering|volunteer]] [[School counselor#United States|school counselors]].&lt;ref name="CalArts" /&gt;

The school was closed in the Summer of 2004 due to financial shortages by the LAUSD.

EAGLES Center initiated the first [[prom]] for LGBT students for the school, open for students from other high schools in the school district. It was advertised in the media as an open invitation for the first prom of its kind in the nation. On May 20, 1994, it took place in the [[Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts|Los Angeles Hilton hotel]].

'''Ear training''' or '''aural skills''' is a skill by which [[musician]]s learn to identify, solely by hearing, [[pitch (music)|pitche]]s, [[interval (music)|interval]]s, [[melody (music)|melody]], [[chord (music)|chord]]s, [[rhythm]]s, and other basic elements of [[music]].  The application of this skill is analogous to taking dictation in written/spoken language.  As a process, ear training is in essence the inverse of [[sight-singing]], the latter being analogous to reading a written text aloud without prior opportunity to review the material. Ear training is typically a component of formal musical training.

== Functional pitch recognition ==

Functional pitch recognition involves identifying the function or role of a single pitch in the context of an established [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]. Once a tonic has been established, each subsequent pitch may be classified without direct reference to accompanying pitches.  For example, once the tonic G has been established, listeners may recognize that the pitch D plays the role of the dominant in the key of G. No reference to any other pitch is required to establish this fact.

Many musicians use functional pitch recognition in order to identify, understand, and appreciate the roles and meanings of pitches within a key.  To this end, scale-degree numbers or movable-''do'' [[solmization]] (''do, re, mi,'' etc.) can be quite helpful.  Using such systems, pitches with identical functions (the key note or tonic, for example) are associated with identical labels (''1'' or ''do,'' for example).

Functional pitch recognition is not the same as fixed-''do'' [[solfège]], e.g. ''do, re, mi'', etc. Functional pitch recognition emphasizes the role of a pitch with respect to the tonic, while fixed-''do'' solfège symbols are labels for absolute pitch values (''do''=C, ''re''=D, etc., in any key). In the fixed-''do'' system (used in the conservatories of the Romance language nations, e.g. Paris, Madrid, Rome, as well as the [[Juilliard School]] and the [[Curtis Institute]] in the USA), solfège symbols do not describe the role of pitches relative to a tonic, but rather actual pitches. In the movable-do system, there happens to be a correspondence between the solfège symbol and a pitch's role. However, there is no requirement that musicians associate the solfège symbols with the scale degrees. In fact, musicians may utilize the movable-''do'' system to label pitches while mentally tracking intervals to determine the sequence of solfège symbols.

Functional pitch recognition has several strengths. Since a large body of music is tonal, the technique is widely applicable. Since reference pitches are not required, music may be broken up by complex and difficult to analyze pitch clusters, for example, a percussion sequence, and pitch analysis may resume immediately once an easier to identify pitch is played, for example, by a trumpet—no need to keep track of the last note of the previous line or solo nor any need to keep track of a series of intervals going back all the way to the start of a piece. Since the function of pitch classes is a key element, the problem of compound intervals with interval recognition is not an issue—whether the notes in a melody are played within a single octave or over many octaves is irrelevant.

Functional pitch recognition has some weaknesses. Music with no tonic or ambiguous tonality&lt;ref&gt;For the cognitive foundations of atonality,  see Humphries, Lee. [http://www.thinkingapplied.com/tonality_folder/tonality.htm "Atonality, Information, and the Politics of Perception"], ''Enclitic'', Vol. III, No. 1 (Spring, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; does not provide the frame of reference necessary for this type of analysis. When dealing with key changes, a student must know how to account for pitch function recognition after the key changes: retain the original tonic or change the frame of reference to the new tonic. This last aspect in particular, requires an ongoing real-time (even anticipatory) analysis of the music that is complicated by modulations and is the chief detriment to the movable-do system.

== Interval recognition ==
{{Main|Interval recognition}}

[[Interval (music)|Interval]] recognition is also a useful skill for musicians: in order to determine the notes in a [[melody]], a musician must have some ability to recognize intervals. Some music teachers teach their students relative pitch by having them associate each possible interval with the first two notes of a popular song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Mayfield, Connie E. | year=2002 | title=Theory Essentials, Volume I: An Integrated Approach to Harmony, Ear Training, and Keyboard Skills | publisher=Schirmer | location=New York | isbn=0-534-57231-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have shown that such familiar-melody associations are quite limited in scope, applicable only to the specific scale-degrees found in each melody.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Michael (1983): "Beyond Intervals: The Teaching of Tonal Hearing," ''Journal of Music Theory Pedagogy'', (6):18-34&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are various systems (including [[solfeggio]], [[sargam (music)|sargam]], and [[numerical sight-singing]]) that assign specific syllables to different notes of the [[scale (music)|scale]]. Among other things, this makes it easier to hear how intervals sound in different contexts, such as starting on different notes of the same scale.

== Chord recognition ==
Complementary to recognizing the melody of a song is hearing the harmonic structures that support it. Musicians often practise hearing different types of chords and their [[Inverted chord|inversions]] out of context, just to hear the characteristic sound of the chord. They also learn [[chord progression]]s to hear how chords relate to one another in the context of a piece of music.

== Microtonal chord and interval recognition ==

The process is similar to twelve-tone ear training, but with many more intervals to distinguish. Aspects of microtonal ear training are covered in  ''Harmonic Experience'', by [[W. A. Mathieu]], with sight-singing exercises, such as singing over a [[Drone_(music)|drone]], to learn to recognize just intonation intervals. There are also software projects underway or completed geared to ear training or to assist in microtonal performance.

Gro Shetelig at The Norwegian Academy of Music is working on the development of a Microtonal Ear Training method for singers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lassethoresen.com/concrescence/index.html The Concrescence Project] Artistic Director Professor Lasse Thoresen, Norwegian Academy, Oslo&lt;/ref&gt; and has developed the software Micropalette,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lassethoresen.com/concrescence/micropalette.html Micropalette] from Concrescence&lt;/ref&gt; a tool for listening to microtonal tones, chords and intervals. Aaron Hunt at Hi Pi instruments has developed Xentone,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-pi.com/XENTsoftware.html Xentone] at Hi Pi Instruments&lt;/ref&gt; another tool for microtonal ear training.

== Rhythm recognition ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
One way musicians practise rhythms is by breaking them up into smaller, more easily identifiable sub-patterns. For example, one might start by learning the sound of all the combinations of four [[eighth note]]s and eighth rests, and then proceed to string different four-note patterns together.

Another way to practise rhythms is by [[muscle memory]], or teaching rhythm to different muscles in the body. One may start by tapping a rhythm with the hands and feet individually, or singing a rhythm on a syllable (e.g. "ta"). Later stages may combine keeping time with the hand, foot, or voice and simultaneously tapping out the rhythm, and beating out multiple overlapping rhythms.

A [[metronome]] may be used to assist in maintaining accurate tempo.

== Timbre recognition ==
Each type of musical instrument has a characteristic sound quality that is largely independent of pitch or loudness. Some instruments have more than one timbre, e.g. the sound of a plucked violin is different from the sound of a bowed violin.  Some instruments employ multiple manual or [[embouchure]] techniques to achieve the same pitch through a variety of timbres.  If these timbres are essential to the melody or function, as in [[shakuhachi]] music, then pitch training alone will not be enough to fully recognize the music.  Learning to identify and differentiate various timbres is an important musical skill that can be acquired and improved by training.

== Transcription ==
Music teachers often recommend [[Transcription (music)|transcribing]] recorded music as a way to practise all of the above, including recognizing rhythm, melody and harmony. The teacher may also perform (‘dictate’) short compositions, with the pupil listening and transcribing them on to paper.

== Modern training methods ==
For accurate identification and reproduction of musical intervals, scales, chords, rhythms, and other audible parameters a great deal of practice is often necessary. Exercises involving identification often require a knowledgeable partner to play the passages in question and to assess the answers given. Specialised [[music theory]] software can remove the need for a partner, customise the training to the user’s needs and accurately track progress. Conservatories and university music departments often license commercial software for their students, such as [[Meludia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicalsource.com/db_control/db_news.php?id=3528 Meludia becomes the first online interactive educational method recognized by The Curtis Institute of Music]&lt;/ref&gt; [[EarMaster]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/drew.waters/elementary120b_home.htm Plattsburgh State - Dr. Drew Waters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173107/http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/drew.waters/elementary120b_home.htm |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Auralia (software)|Auralia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.risingsoftware.com/auralia/ Published by Rising Software&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csub.edu/catalog/_files/2009-2011_updated/022-009.pdf Teaching Music With Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ulm.edu/~everett/auralskills.html Dr. Micah Everett - ULM Division of Music - Aural Skills Course Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212201159/http://www.ulm.edu/~everett/auralskills.html |date=2012-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and MacGAMUT,&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.augie.edu/~randrews/theory/Course_main.html Augustana College Music Theory courses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514002441/http://faculty.augie.edu/~randrews/theory/Course_main.html |date=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so that they can track and manage student scores on a computer network. A variety of free software also exists, either as browser-based applications or as downloadable executables. For example, [[free software|free]] and [[open source software]] under the [[GPL]], such as [[GNU Solfege]], often provides many features comparable with those of popular [[proprietary software|proprietary]] products.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Most ear-training software is [[MIDI]]-based, permitting the user to customise the instruments used and even to receive input from [[MIDI controller|MIDI-compatible devices]] such as [[electronic keyboard]]s.

'''Education in [[Hungary]]''' is predominantly public, run by the [[Minister of Education (Hungary)|Ministry of Human Resources]]. [[Preschool]] [[kindergarten]] education is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] and provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is also [[compulsory education|compulsory]] until age of sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/documents/facts_and_figures/compulsory_education_EN.pdf | title=Compulsory Education in Europe 2013/2014 | publisher=European commission | accessdate=19 May 2014 | author=Eurydice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Primary education]] usually lasts for eight years. [[Secondary education]] includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] enrols the most gifted children and prepares students for university studies; the secondary vocational schools for intermediate students lasts four years and the technical school prepares pupils for [[vocational training|vocational education]] and the world of work. The system is partly flexible and bridges exist, graduates from a vocational school can achieve a two years program to have access to vocational higher education for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=HUN | title=Vocational Education in Hungary | date=October 2013 | accessdate=19 May 2014 | author=UNESCO-UNEVOC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study]] (TIMSS) rated 13–14-year-old pupils in Hungary among the bests in the world for maths and science.

Most of the [[List of universities in Hungary|Hungarian universities]] are [[public university|public institutions]], and students traditionally study without fee payment. The general requirement for university is the [[Matura]]. The Hungarian public [[higher education]] system includes universities and other higher education institutes, that provide both education curricula and related degrees up to doctoral degree and also contribute to research activities. Health insurance for students is free until the end of their studies. English and German language is important in Hungarian higher education, there are a number of degree programs that are taught in these languages, which attracts thousands of [[Student exchange program|exchange students]] every year. Hungary's higher education and training has been ranked 44 out of 148 countries in the Global competitiveness Report 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2013-14.pdf |title=Global Competitiveness Record 2013/2014 |accessdate=19 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005151/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2007/06/12/afx3810988.html |archivedate=4 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there are 67 [[List of universities in Hungary|higher education institutions]] in [[Hungary]], ranging from small colleges to top [[University|research universities]]. These universities and colleges are maintained either by the state, private organizations or a church. In accordance with the objectives of the [[Bologna process]] the degree structure of [[tertiary education]] is based on three cycles. Nearly all study fields lead first to a [[Bachelor’s degree]] (usually 3 years), and after a further study period to a [[Master’s degree]] (2 years). However, there are some exceptions: medicine, pharmacy, dental and veterinary studies, architecture, law, teacher training, and certain arts-, crafts- and design-related study programmes, which retain a long single-cycle structure of 5 or 6 years of study. The first-cycle programmes last 6–8 semesters (3–4 years, 180–240 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|credit points]]) and lead to a bachelor's degree (in Hungarian: alapfokozat). The second cycle, leading to a master's degree (in Hungarian: mesterfokozat), lasts 2–4 semesters (1–2 years, 60–120 credit points). Two-year-long vocational higher education programmes (in Hungarian: felsőoktatási szakképzés) are also available on an optional basis prior to first-cycle programmes and lead to advanced vocational qualifications. The 120 credit points gained in vocational higher education programmes are compatible for recognition in the first (Bachelor) cycle. Any Bachelor’s or master's degree can be followed by specialised higher education courses (in Hungarian: szakirányú továbbképzés). These do not lead to another degree but offer the option of specialisation in a particular field of study. Courses can be studied full-time, part-time or through distance learning. A four-year [[Doctorate|doctoral programme]] is a [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] course to follow any Master’s or equivalent qualification.

Hungary has a long tradition of higher education reflecting the existence of established [[knowledge economy]]. The established [[List of universities in Hungary|universities in Hungary]] include some of the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest in the world]], the first was the [[University of Pécs]] founded in 1367 which is still functioning, although in the year 1276, the university of [[Veszprém]] was destroyed by the troops of [[Peter I Csák|Peter Csák]], but it was never rebuilt. [[Sigismund]] established [[Óbuda University]] in 1395. Another, [[Universitas Istropolitana]], was established 1465 in [[Pozsony]] by [[Mattias Corvinus]].
[[Nagyszombat]] University was founded in 1635 and moved to Buda in 1777 and it is called [[Eötvös Loránd University]] today. The world's first [[institute of technology]] was founded in [[Selmecbánya]], Kingdom of Hungary in 1735, its legal successor is the [[University of Miskolc]]. The [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]] is considered the oldest institute of technology in the world with university rank and structure, its legal predecessor the Institutum Geometrico-Hydrotechnicum was founded in 1782 by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]].

==The social environment of education==

The decline of [[Hungary]]'s population that started in 1981 has also continued in recent years. According to the 2001 [[census]], the [[demographics of Hungary|population of Hungary]] was 10,198,000, about half a million less than the figure of twenty years earlier. By 2005 the population dropped to 10,077,000. The age pyramid of the Hungarian population is among the most irregular ones in [[Europe]]. On 1 January 2005, due to the extremely low number of live births in the preceding years the size of the 0-4-year-old population was smaller than the next age groups of five-year increments up to the age group 60-64. There are major differences in the size of the various [[generation]]s.

The official language of instruction is [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], but a number of ethnic and
national [[minorities]] (e.g. [[German people|German]], [[Romanian people|Romanian]], [[Slovenes|Slovene]], [[Serb]] and [[Croats|Croatian]]) have [[minority education]]al institutions with their own languages as first or second language of instruction at primary and secondary level of teaching. According to the 2003 [[statistical survey|survey]], the rate of [[Romani people|Romani]] children in the population entering school education in 2008-2009 is expected to be around 15%.&lt;ref&gt;Medgyesi, M. (2007). [http://www.oki.hu/oldal.php?tipus=cikk&amp;kod=eduhun2006-02_socio_economic ''The socio-economic environment of education.''] In Loboda, Z., Lannert, J. and Halász, G. (ed.)

==School system in Hungary==

A special feature of the Hungarian education system is that [[institutional structure]]s and the structure of [[educational programme]]s are not aligned with each other. The system's institutional structure and the presence of programmes allowing early selection show similarities with [[Central Europe]]an and ex-[[socialist]] countries. The system's content structure, the uniform and general phase of education has extended, and [[secondary education|secondary]] level education may be characterised by increased opportunities for transition. The general phase of education lasts until the age of 16 in Hungary's [[education system]]. Participation in [[secondary education]], offering a wide variety of programmes, is fairly high. Within [[secondary education]], the proportion of students studying in programmes leading to a secondary [[school-leaving certificate]] and offering transition to [[tertiary education]] is around the international average.&lt;ref&gt;Imre, A. and Györgyi, Z. (2007). [http://www.oki.hu/oldal.php?tipus=cikk&amp;kod=eduhun2006-05_system ''The educational system and the progression of students.''] In Loboda, Z., Lannert, J. and Halász, G. (ed.)

===Organization of the educational system===

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:eduhun2006-14_structure_01_nagy.gif]] --&gt;

===Pre-primary education===

This educational level is considered as a crucially important integrated part of the school
system. It caters for children from 3 to 7 years of age. Since 2015, participation in pre-primary education at this level ([[kindergarten]]) is compulsory from age 3 (before 2015 only the final year - beyond age 5 - was compulsory), although exceptions are made for developmental reasons &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002299/229933E.pdf |title=Review |date=2015 |website=unesdoc.unesco.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caboodle.hu"&gt;[http://www.caboodle.hu/nc/news/news_archive/single_page/?tx_ttnews&amp;#91;tt_news&amp;#93;=9571  Hungary lowers mandatory school age to three] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222936/http://www.caboodle.hu/nc/news/news_archive/single_page/?tx_ttnews&amp;#91;tt_news&amp; |date=December 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public-sector institutions may only charge for services additional to their basic tasks, including for example extracurricular activities, meals, excursions, etc. Currently, the attendance rate with regard to the age groups 3-5, is just above 86%. The average duration of participation of children aged 3–7 in pre-primary education is just over 3 years (3.3), which is the highest average value in Europe.&lt;ref name="eurydice.org"&gt;[http://www.eurydice.org/portal/page/portal/Eurydice/showPresentation?pubid=047EN ''National summary sheets on education systems in Europe and ongoing reforms'']. (2006) Brussels: Eurydice.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:OVODA.jpg|thumb|A [[Hungary|Hungarian]] pre-school class having outdoor activities, March 2007.]]
In [[Hungary]] a kindergarten is called an ''óvoda'' ('place for caring'). Children attend kindergarten between the ages of 3–6/7 (they go to school in the year in which they have their 7th birthday). Attendance in kindergarten is compulsory from the age of 3 years, though exceptions are made for developmental reasons.&lt;ref name="caboodle.hu"/&gt; Though kindergartens may include programs in subjects such as foreign languages and music, children spend most of their time playing. In their last year children begin to be prepared to attend elementary school.

Most kindergartens are state-funded. Kindergarten teachers are required to have a diploma.

===Primary education===

Children start [[primary school]] when they reach school-maturity, usually in the year in which they have their 6th birthday (7th if they were born after May 31).&lt;!-- 6 is the traditional one --&gt;

Primary education can last for 4, 6 or 8 years. 8-year education is the most widespread; the other two options were introduced in the early 1990s.

Subjects include [[literature]], [[grammar]], [[mathematics]], [[music]], [[drawing|art]], [[Physical education]], [[environmental studies]] (from 1st to 5th grade), [[biology]] (from 6th grade), [[geography]] (from 6th grade), [[history]] (from 5th grade), [[history of art]], &lt;!-- from 5th grade, I think) --&gt; [[physics]] (from 6th grade), [[chemistry]] (from 7th grade), one or two foreign languages (usually [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] or [[French language|French]]). Before 1990, [[Russian language|Russian]] was compulsory.

===Secondary education===

Secondary education usually lasts for 4 years. In ''gimnázium''s it can also last for 5, 6 or 8 years depending on how many years the student spent in primary school. Since 1997 the numbering of years in secondary school are following that of primary school (i. e. after the 8th grade of primary school the student goes to 9th grade, which is actually the 1st year of secondary school.)

There are three kinds of high schools:
* ''Gimnázium'' (grammar school; prepares students for higher education; teaches at least 2 foreign languages)
* ''Szakgimnázium'' (secondary vocational school. It also provides a "secondary school leaving examination" opening higher education curriculum. )
* ''Szakközépiskola'' (vocational school. It also offers "bridge" programs to help low achieving students in primary school to catch up and join the usual vocational school curriculum)&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=HUN | title=Vocational Education in Hungary | date=27 October 2013 | accessdate=19 May 2014 | author=UNESCO-UNEVOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After finishing high school, students take a school-leaving exam ([[Matura]] or final exam, ''érettségi'' in Hungarian). From 2005 this consists of exams on five subjects: written exam in mathematics, verbal and written exams in ''Hungarian literature and grammar'', a ''foreign language'', ''history'', and written and/or verbal exam in a subject of the ''student's choice''. These exams also serve as an entry exam to universities and colleges.

====New secondary form until the school year of 2004/2005====

Many of the ''gimnázium''s have begun to teach a foreign language intensively (usually 12-14 lessons a week) and [[Information technology|IT]] (usually 3-4 lessons a week) in the first year. This is called ''nyelvi előkészítő évfolyam'', literally "Language training class", or simply ''nulladik évfolyam'' (literally "0th grade"). After 2005, students will have less foreign language lessons and [[Information technology|IT]].

At schools where there is no ''nulladik évfolyam'' (beginners classes), they may be required to introduce them because the majority of Hungarians do not speak more than one language, or only speak their parents' language or dialect. Most students will finish High School at the age of 18 or 19, or when they complete Year 13.

Those who had at least an intermediate level language exam weren't required to pass a language exam at Matura, but has become compulsory since 2006. In language training classes, a student must pass an intermediate level language exam in the second year, and the same level Matura in the third year.

===Higher education===
{{see also|List of universities in Hungary}}
{{see also|Academic ranks in Hungary}}

Higher education in Hungary dates back to 1367 when [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]] founded the first Hungarian university in the city of [[Pécs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pte.hu/menu/21 Magyarország első egyeteme. PTE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spainexchange.com/school-3387-en.htm University of Pécs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher education is divided between [[college]]s and [[University|universities]]. College education generally lasts for 4 years, while university education lasts for 4 to 6 years depending on the course undertaken. Vocational curriculum usually last 2 years: they are opened to secondary vocational school's graduates, and eventually vocational school students (after 5 years of work in the desired field or after a two-year program leading to a "secondary school leaving certificate").&lt;ref name=UNEVOC/&gt; University [[PhD]] courses usually take 3 years to complete.

Before students get their degree, they must pass an intermediate level language exam in the foreign language of their choice. English and German are the most popular. The number of Spanish-learners has been growing in the last few years.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Recently a high number of students chose [[Esperanto]] and [[Romani language|Romani]] languages. Both are said to have a relatively small vocabulary and easy grammar.

===Vocational schools ===
This school type (in Hungarian: szakiskola) typically provides general and pre-vocational education in grades 9 and 10, normally followed by three or two years of VET. At the end of their studies, students will acquire a qualification (ISCED 2C or mostly 3C).&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.tpf.hu/pages/content/index.php?page_id=81 Tempus: Studying in Hungary - Education system]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foreign students in Hungary ==
Hungary attracts foreign students from both EU and non-EU countries. Three quarters of the students arriving in Hungary arrive from just ten countries, while one quarter of the students arrives from another 100 countries. Among the countries sending most students are Germany, Iran, Norway, Israel and Sweden, while the majority of guest students are citizens of the neighbouring countries. In the 2008/2009 academic year, the total number of foreign students studying in Hungary was 16 916, while this number was only 14 491 in 2005/2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.felvi.hu/for_foreigners/research/increasing_number_of_foreign_students Felvi.hu: An increasing number of foreign students each year]&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are increasing owing to the following advantages:
* Hungary offers affordable tuition fees and living costs within the European Union and Schengen area;
* A number of Nobel Prize Winners and scientific inventors were educated there;
* There are easier admission procedures and fewer documents are needed for obtaining admission;
* Hungary offers different types of scholarships for foreigners;
* The cost of student accommodation in Hungary is lower than in most Western European Countries and Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studyinginbudapest.com/2014/06/accommodation-in-budapest.html "Student accommodation costs in Budapest"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many education programmes are offered in English and/or German;
* Hungarian embassies issue education visas more easily than other European Union and Schengen Member States;
* Residence permits issued in Hungary for foreign students allow them to travel to other Schengen countries without any further visa;
* A number of low cost flights connect Hungarian cities to other countries and popular travel destinations;
* There are employment opportunities in the European Union during education years and after graduation, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.study-hungary.com/why-to-study-in-hungary Study-hungary.com: Why study in Hungary?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparatory courses===
Students interested in continuing their studies in Hungary will find preparatory courses in numerous universities from Debrecen to Budapest, from Budapest to Szeged, from Szeged to Pécs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.felvi.hu/for_foreigners/useful_cues/preparatory_courses Felvi.hu: University preparatory courses]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17596">'''Educator effectiveness''' is a [[K–12 (education)|K-12 school system]] education policy initiative that measures the quality of an [[Teacher|educator]] performance in terms of improving student learning. It describes a variety of methods, such as observations, student assessments, student work samples and examples of teacher work, that education leaders use to determine the effectiveness of a K-12 educator.

The drive for educator effectiveness programs stem from [[Race to the top]] where states were awarded points for meeting educational policies based on the teacher's effectiveness. This policy was the basis of the emergence of statewide educator effectiveness programs.

Educator effectiveness programs vary from state to state.  Typically, an educator effectiveness program describes a cycle of observations and assessments that apply to different groups of teachers during an academic year. New teachers are evaluated more frequently, and veteran teachers are evaluated across multiple year cycles. Evaluated teachers have multiple scheduled classroom observations and conferences with the evaluator in addition to unannounced classroom observations. A controversial aspect of  The purpose of evaluations is to help educators determine what is effective in their practices and provides them a medium to reflect upon and change their practice to help teachers become more effective.

== Definition ==
Educator effectiveness is a method used in the K-12 school system that uses multiple measures of assessments including classroom observations, student work samples, assessment scores and teacher artifacts, to determine the impact a particular teacher has on student's learning outcomes. While schools have used teacher evaluation practices and policies for many years, the emergence of educator effectiveness policies combines these existing practices with rubrics and test scores to provide more robust perspectives on the work of teachers. Educator effectiveness initiatives often use descriptions of effective teaching practices, such as [[Charlotte Danielson]]'s "Framework for Teaching", to organize teaching separate domains for assessment. Danielson's domains include: Planning and Preparation, Classroom Environment, Professional Responsibilities, and Instruction.

== Purpose ==
Teacher evaluations have changed over time and have had different standards across the United States. Evaluation systems often have been comprised an administrator observing a teacher a couple times per year. In some locations, teacher observations were only done on a three-year or longer cycle. In the past, a Widget Effect, as described by [[The New Teacher Project]] has been established that has developed a culture where all teachers feel as though they deserve the highest marks on evaluations. Schools used to see their job as filling positions and thought that any teacher who was given a license was high quality, and thus scored them according to that thought process. Therefore, all teachers were getting scores that were good or great and no variation was able to be determined between any two teachers.

Today, federal and state policies have encouraged school systems to design more comprehensive evaluation systems that rely on multiple measures of how a teacher performs by looking at items such as student performance gains, classroom observations, teacher reflections, content specific knowledge and student reflections. Some policy makers and researchers encourage the design of systems to identify and sort good and bad teachers; others are designed to provide meaningful feedback and professional development to teachers in order to enhance their skills.

Overall, the purpose of educator effectiveness is to build the capacity for teachers to enhance their skills. The effective teachers have an effect on student's ability to have a higher level of conceptual understanding of a topic and have displayed the ability to think more abstractly than peers taught by less effective teachers. Quality teaching also has been identified as a key influence for positive learning outcomes for the diverse body of students in the classroom.

== How it is being used ==
As of 2013, US schools United States had very little cohesiveness in their teacher effectiveness requirements and implementations. In 2013, 25 states required that student achievement is a big or the biggest part of teacher evaluations. Twenty-seven states required teacher evaluations be based on a variety of student assessments and work samples and 44 states required classroom observations to be put into teacher evaluations. Overall, 11 states require a statewide teacher evaluation system; 10 states gave a statewide evaluation model that districts can either do or decide to do a similar model. To date only a small handful of states have adopted policies connecting the performance of students to their teachers and the colleges where the teachers were trained.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, K.M &amp; Jacobs, S. (2013).  State of the States 2013: Connect the Dots – Using evaluations of teacher effectiveness to inform policy and practice. Washington, D.C. The National Council on Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have national policies that decide what teacher evaluation systems that schools will have to follow. Some countries such as [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], Iceland, Norway and [[Sweden]] provide annual feedback on teaching practices. Other countries, such as Norway and Iceland leave the decision about how the teacher evaluations systems will be done to be determined at a local level. The quality of teaching in these countries is compared to the curriculum they follow and with the school instructional plan. Finland does not use any standardized testing as a measure of teacher effectiveness. Singapore is another country that does not use test scores but rather focuses on how teachers work together as a main part of their evaluation system. Singapore also focuses heavily on professional development around evaluation, coaching, mentoring and collaborating with other educators with an overall goal of getting a high quality teaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, T. (2013, March 25). How Do High-Performing Nations Evaluate Teachers? - NEA Today. Retrieved April 22, 2015, from http://neatoday.org/2013/03/25/how-do-high-performing-nations-evaluate-teachers/&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant debate in the U.S. about how to reward teachers for performance as measured by educator effectiveness policies. Some schools rewards teachers by paying them more based upon their student's test scores, which is linked to the Race to the Top funding in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, J. (2004). Pay based on test scores? What educators need to know about linking teacher pay to student achievement. National Education Association.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other reward systems are being created based on the idea that improving a teacher's capacity to learn and improve upon their practice will have a direct impact on student achievement. These schools increase pay for teachers who have a  National Board Certification using [[National Board for Professional Teaching Standards]], advanced degrees, engaging in professional development, mentor new colleagues and paying more for these qualified teachers in hard to staff schools &lt;ref&gt;Flannery, M.E. &amp; Jehlen, A. (2008). Where is your pay plan heading? National Education Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection of teacher effectiveness and merit pay varies in different countries. In Finland and Canada, they do not to use merit-pay approaches but encourage conversations between the evaluator and teacher about student progress and success. In contrast, Chinese and Singaporean teachers, get financial bonuses and promotions for high performance. High-performing countries have a strong system of professional and school-level accountability but look at success on things such as school improvement goals, professional contributions, and indicators of student well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, V. (2010). Raising Teacher Quality Around the World. Educational Leadership, 68(4), 16-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods of evaluating teachers ===
Most educator effectiveness programs rely two kinds of data: observations of teaching practices and student outcomes data. There are four main sources of observational data collected by schools:
# Classroom observations happen when someone comes into a teacher's classroom to observe their teaching practice, typically done by a school administrator. The methods of commenting on teaching practice within classroom observations varies from district created to purchased evaluation forms.&lt;ref&gt;Goe, L. &amp; Croft, A. (2008). Methods of Evaluating Teacher Effectiveness. Research-to-Practice Brief. National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some schools use Self-Evaluation as a reflective tool for teachers to look at their current practice and change what they are doing to have a greater educational impact on students. Teachers often use a variety of tools to reflect and change their practice including self-monitoring, recording their own practice, and student's feedback through survey's and questionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, M. (2015). Self-Evaluation of Teaching. Ryerson University: The Learning and Teaching Office.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Teacher Portfolios are used to compile a variety of evidence of teacher practices for the purpose of showing development of teaching over time. It is often used in conjunction with self-reflection or peer-reviewing of teaching practices.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Teaching. (2015) Teaching Portfolios from http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/teaching-portfolios/&lt;/ref&gt;
# Peer-Review of Teaching is a method for teaching to discuss their practice with another teacher or group of teachers that gives feedback about teaching and learning. Often an evaluation of the teaching materials is done with the purpose of providing feedback to change teaching practices.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Teaching and Learning (2015). Peer Review of Teaching.  University of Minnesota from http://www1.umn.edu/ohr/teachlearn/resources/peer/&lt;/ref&gt;

The new part of educator effectiveness policies is the integration of outcome data into the evaluation process. The biggest component of the outcome data is growth of student learning as measured by standardized tests. Most educator effectiveness programs rely on some form of value-added measures to determine student growth. Value-added measure use longitudinal measures of student achievement to estimate the growth in student learning that can be attributed to individual teachers. If the students of a specific teacher demonstrate growth in learning better than predicated on standardized tests, the teacher is said to be effective; if the students score below the predicted scores, the teacher is said to be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Goe, L. &amp; Croft, A. (2008). Methods of Evaluating Teacher Effectiveness. Research-to-Practice Brief. National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;  Parent and student surveys are another method of collecting data on teachers and their educational practices.&lt;ref&gt;Teaching and Learning Center (2015).  General Education Improvement. University of the Science from http://www.usciences.edu/teaching/tips/improvement.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Many argue that it is difficult to measure the effect that teachers have on student learning. Many teachers who are in the K-12 system, teach subjects that are not assessed on state mandated testing. In order to effectively implement an educator effectiveness system, some argue that states need to create different evaluation systems for the teachers who teach students in non-tested areas such as submitted portfolios of student work, lesson logs, video clips of them teaching and reflective commentaries on lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Darling-Hammond, . (2012). Creating a comprehensive system for evaluating and supporting effective teaching. Stanford, CA. Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue about the methodology as some districts are using value added models to determine the effectiveness to teachers. They state that it is an unreliable measurement tool because the makeup of classes differ greatly from teacher to teacher and from year to year. Some say that it ends up penalizing teachers who traditionally do not score well on standardized assessments such as students who receive free and reduce lunch and students with disabilities. They state that this may cause the highly effective teachers to work at schools with a low disability rate and a middle to high socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;Darling-Hammond, . (2012). Creating a comprehensive system for evaluating and supporting effective teaching. Stanford, CA. Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different ways to calculate the value-added effect of teachers that changes depending on how they define value-added and what they use to calculate it.  It typically does not account for the expectations put on students who go into a classroom reading below grade level and are expected to have a much higher growth rate than their peers.  Through many research studies, it has shown that the estimates of teacher effectiveness were not through the same throughout different years or content areas  such as reading and math and may be difficult to compare gains from tests from year to year when they don't measure the same content &lt;ref&gt;David, J.L ( 2010). What research says about using value-added measures to evaluate teachers. Educational Leadership (67)8&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have commented that evaluators in states with teacher evaluation systems do not have through enough training. Furthermore, these evaluators often do not have to prove themselves as effective teachers themselves. As of 2013, only 13 states require a certification for their evaluators that require evaluators are effective teachers. Furthermore, often the same evaluator is observing students every time. In order to have high quality teacher feedback, some would argue that multiple perspectives by highly effective educators would create the dialogue and feedback that would help teachers to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, K.M &amp; Jacobs, S.

'''Ella Barksdale Brown''' was an American anti-lynching advocate, educator, and journalist, and a member of the first graduating class of [[Spelman College]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

Brown was born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], on June 22, 1871. After marrying John M. Brown in Georgia, she moved to [[New Jersey]] in 1901.&lt;ref name="remember ella"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morgan|first1=Earl|title=Morgan's Corner: Remembering Ella Barksdale Brown|url=http://www.nj.com/hudson/voices/index.ssf/2013/02/morgans_corner_remembering_ell.html|accessdate=24 December 2017|date=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was given credit for introducing African-American studies into Jersey City Schools and for designating March 5 as [[Crispus Attucks]] day in New Jersey.

As a journalist, Brown wrote for ''[[The Chicago Defender]]'' and ''[[The New York Amsterdam News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ella Barksdale Brown Papers|url=http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/about/blogs/african-american-studies-beinecke-library/2008/12/03/ella-barksdale-brown-papers|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Farrington v. Tokushige''''', 273 U.S. 284 (1927),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Farrington v. Tokushige|273|284|1927}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] unanimously struck down the [[Territory of Hawaii]]'s law, making it illegal for schools to teach foreign languages without a permit, as it violated the [[due process clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. Violation of the due process clause under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] was not considered as Hawaii was a territory of the United States at the time. 

==Decision==
The Court unanimously affirmed the lower court's decision:

:''The foregoing statement is enough to show that the school Act and the measures adopted thereunder go far beyond mere regulation of privately supported schools where children obtain instruction deemed valuable by their parents and which is not obviously in conflict with any public interest. They give affirmative direction concerning the intimate and essential details of such schools, intrust their control to public officers, and deny both owners and patrons reasonable choice and discretion in respect of teachers, curriculum and text-books. Enforcement of the Act probably would destroy most, if not all, of them; and, certainly, it would deprive parents of fair opportunity to procure for their children instruction which they think important and we cannot say is harmful. The Japanese parent has the right to direct the education of his own child without unreasonable restrictions; the Constitution protects him as well as those who speak another tongue.''

The Court stated that "owners, parents and children" are guaranteed rights by the [[due process clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] with reference to ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'', ''[[Bartels v. Iowa]]'', and ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]''.

She has been called the "[[Ralph Nader]] of Harlem"&lt;ref name="new york times" /&gt; and is also known as the mother of the Harlem Consumer Movement.&lt;ref name="villagevoice1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Noel |first=Peter |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/the-sins-of-reverend-calvin-butts-6419536 |title=The Sins of Reverend Calvin Butts |publisher=Village Voice |date=October 27, 1998 |accessdate=October 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Florence M. Rice was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], on March 22, 1919. Florence's family emigrated to the United States from the West Indies before she was born. She spent many years in the [[Colored Orphan Asylum]], one of the first charitable institutions dedicated to the needs of African-American children.&lt;ref name="MNN Diaries" /&gt; 
Florence M. Rice was the founder in the 1960s of the [[Harlem]] Consumer Education Council, Inc. It is a private, non-profit, consumer advocacy organization, established to address issues of poverty, neglect, and exploitation confronting poor and low-income citizens in New York City's Harlem community.

Rice was an early champion for abortion rights for women. She spoke out openly about her life in the 1930s, as a young woman working at a laundry in Harlem, and having an illegal abortion. In 1969, she joined other outspoken women in talking openly about their illegal abortion experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abortionandlife.com/p/women-in-the-film/ |title=Women in the Film at Abortion &amp; Life |publisher=Abortionandlife.com |date= |accessdate=October 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Florence M Rice - 96th Birthday Celebration in Harlem.jpg|thumb|Florence M Rice - 96th Birthday Celebration in Harlem.]]
After completing the eight grade, Florence Rice went to work as a domestic seamstress. She became a member of the [[International Ladies Garment Workers Union]]. In 1962, she participated in a congressional hearing held by [[Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.]], which probed discriminatory union policies and practices towards African Americans and Latinos; she testified regarding the situation in the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]].&lt;ref name="Sigerman2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harriet Sigerman|title=The Columbia Documentary History of American Women Since 1941|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-KdAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143|date=1 November 2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-11699-2|pages=143–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted that after the congressional hearings Rice was [[blacklisted]] and marginalized by the garment industry, which prompted her to start the Harlem Consumer Education Council in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Ignatiev|editor1-first=Noel|editor2-last=Garvey|editor2-first=John|title=Race Traitor|date=1996|publisher=Routlege|location=New York|isbn=9781136665264|page=160|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QnkBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LLC1969"&gt;{{cite news| last=Bird |first=Caroline|title=Balck Womanpower|work=New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D-ECAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA36|date=10 March 1969|publisher=New York Media, LLC|pages=36–41|issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Rice was a member of ILGWU Local 155, and it is documented in the book ''Race Traitor'', by [[Noel Ignatiev]] and John Garvey, that she said she was told that if she testified at the Congressional Committee Hearings before the Ad Hoc Subcommittee on the Investigation of the Garment Industry, she would "never work again in the garment industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cx55JM9J3RQC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;dq=florence+rice+adam+clayton+powell#v=onepage&amp;q=florence%20rice%20adam%20clayton%20powell&amp;f=false |title=Race in America: The Struggle for Equality |author=Herbert Hill |page=299 |date= |accessdate=October 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Harlem Consumer Education Council waged boycotts and picket lines against many Harlem grocery stories that would not hire African Americans. Rice also challenged corporations that discriminated against African Americans.&lt;ref name="Capitol Words"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rangel|first1=Charles|title=Representative|url=http://capitolwords.org/date/2009/11/16/E2769-2_recognizing-the-harlem-council-of-elders-inc-salut/|website=Capitol Words|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her biggest victories was against the [[New York State Public Service Commission]], which was forced to stop charging low-income residents pre-installation fees.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Rice organized Harlem housewives to check store prices and products. They picketed supermarkets, once closed a paint store in Harlem for false advertising that they would give free cans of paint. Her early experiences documented in an article by Caroline Bird in ''New York Magazine'', titled "Black Womanpower", on March 10, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=D-ECAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=florence+rice+harlem#v=onepage&amp;q=florence%20rice%20harlem&amp;f=false |author=Caroline Bird|website=New York Magazine |page=36 |publisher=|title=Black Womanpower|date=March 10, 1969 |accessdate=October 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her apartment was destroyed.

On November 26, 2004, in New York, a Bill was put in place, and a Proclamation given to Ms. Florence Rice. The bill was named in her honor. Her battle with landlords set off many demonstrations and brought awareness to unwarranted evictions of elderly citizens. "With this bill, landlords will no longer be allowed to evict our senior citizens without recourse," Barron told a group of supporters gathered at the steps of City Hall. "Landlords now must go through the Housing Preservation and Development Department before any action can be taken." "This law is named in tribute to Florence Rice who has been unfazed by the most daunting challenges from Con-Ed and New York Telephone," reads the proclamation given to Rice, said Paul Washington, Barron’s chief of staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=l |url=http://harlemconsumercouncil.blogspot.com/2008/11/bill-named-in-honor-of-florence-rice.html?m=1 |title=Senior Tenants &amp; Landlords Reconciliation Project: Bill Named in Honor of Florence Rice |publisher=Harlemconsumercouncil.blogspot.com |date=November 2, 2008 |accessdate=October 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Logo circular.jpg|thumb|GalileoMobile logo]]

'''GalileoMobile''' is a non-profit, itinerant, science education initiative that brings modern astronomy closer to young people around the world, with emphasis in regions that have little or no access to other outreach actions. The initiative was created in late 2008 inspired by the [[International Year of Astronomy|2009 International Year of Astronomy]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomy2009.org/globalprojects/specialprojects/mobile/ IYA2009 Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently run by a group of astronomers, educators, and science communicators.

The team organises workshops for teachers and hands-on astronomy-related activities for students in schools and villages to foster a will of learning and critical thinking through the exciting wonders of our Universe, and to inspire a sense of global citizenship "under the same sky" by promoting a cultural exchange. To encourage follow-up activities GalileoMobile also donates to each school visited a [[Galileoscope]] or [http://kimigali.jp/index-e.html You are Galileo!] telescope, a copy of our [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-resources/galileomobile-handbooks Handbook of activities], a [[Universe Awareness|UNAWE]] Earthball, and other educational material.

In GalileoMobile's first project the team travelled across the high plateau of the Andes in the north of [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-chibolpe2009 Chile, Bolivia, and Peru] during October and November 2009. Since then, GalileoMobile has been to [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-bolivia2012 Bolivia (2012)], [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-india2012 India (2012)], [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-uganda2013 Uganda (2013)], [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-brabo2014 Bolivia and Brazil (2014)], and [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-colombia2014 Colombia (2014)]. Inspired by our expeditions, some of our team members have also carried out activities in Portugal, Nepal, United States, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Guatemala.

In 2015, GalileoMobile embarked on yet another astronomical adventure called [http://www.constellationproject.org Constellation]. This project brings together schools from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru to create a South American network of schools committed to bringing the exciting world of astronomy closer to their students. The students were able to explore the wonders of the Universe by taking part in “Space Exploration”, a series of astronomical outreach activities created especially for this project. Through the network, they will be able to share their passion for the sky with peers from all across South America. Their schools will also benefit from the long-term support of GalileoMobile when independently organising astronomical outreach activities in the years to come. The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] has decided to officially endorse Constellation as a Major Cosmic Light programme of the [[International Year of Light|International Year of Light 2015]] and the [http://www.astro4dev.org Office for Astronomical Development] has decided to officially sponsor about 30% of the entire project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro4dev.org/blog/2015/03/11/overview-of-the-project-52/|title=Overview of the project {{!}} IAU Office of Astronomy for Development|website=www.astro4dev.org|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original high priestess of [[Coven Celeste]], she is a founding elder of the Canadian [[Aquarian Tabernacle Church]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aquariantabernaclechurch.org/atc-affiliates-canada&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first recognized Wiccan chaplain in a public university.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Todd, "University of Victoria chaplain marks solstice with pagan rituals," ''Vancouver Sun'', 16 December 2010, http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2010/12/16/pagans-celebrate-solstice-with-yule-rituals/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Heather Harden was born in [[Newmarket, Ontario]] of mixed [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]]-[[Sioux]] and [[English-Canadian]] heritage; her paternal grandmother was a [[Quaker]]. She was brought up a Jehovah's Witness, living on a small farm on the outskirts of Newmarket, where her parents raised chickens, pigs and ponies. She was heavily involved in [[4-H]] projects and showed the neighbor's [[Ayrshire cattle]]. At 14 she was involved in a near-fatal car accident, an experience which was to shape her future university research interests. At 15, she met her future husband, [[Gary Botting]], at a cousin's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Heather and Gary Botting, ''The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1984), p. xx&lt;/ref&gt; Conforming to the instructions of the [[Watchtower Bible and Tract Society]], the controlling corporation of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], at high school she opted for the "special commercial" (as opposed to academic) program.&lt;ref&gt;''The Orwellian World'', p. xx&lt;/ref&gt; Since their potential union suffered the disapprobation of their respective parents, Heather and Gary eloped in October, 1966—only to discover that nobody had noticed, and it became inconvenient to tell anyone. As a result, they got married a second time, this time publicly, on 1 April 1967 when they realized that "[[April Fool's Day]]" fell on a Saturday, thereby generating a self-perpetuating April Fool's joke.&lt;ref&gt;''The Orwellian World'', p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tihemme Gagnon, "Introduction" to ''Streaking! The Collected Poems of Gary Botting'', Miami: Strategic, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Only then did Heather return to high school, intent on eventually enrolling in university.

== ''The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses'' ==
Heather Botting attended [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] and [[Trent University]], majoring in anthropology. At the [[University of Alberta]], she received the highest marks in the entire university, guaranteeing her a prestigious [[Killam Scholarship]] for graduate studies.&lt;ref&gt;''The Orwellian World'', p. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; She completed her Master of Arts and Ph.D. degrees in the [[anthropology of religion]] with research on Jehovah's Witnesses—the religion she had left behind. Her dissertation "The Power and the Glory: The Symbolic Vision and Social Dynamic of Jehovah's Witnesses"&lt;ref&gt;University of Alberta, Ph.D. diss. 1982&lt;/ref&gt; is an analysis of the power relations operative within Jehovah's Witnesses, focusing on a specific microsociety of individuals within the movement, "showing the levels of involvement, commitment, and status achieved within the sect by each person in the microsociety."&lt;ref&gt;Heather and Gary Botting, ''The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1984) p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; The raw research data for her dissertation was collected over a nine-year period from 1973 to 1982, and continued to be collected until she and Gary published ''The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses'' through University of Toronto Press in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Bettson, "Witnesses risk future with book", ''Calgary Herald'', Wednesday 23 May 1984&lt;/ref&gt; The book is an exposé of "Witness history, beliefs, and social imperatives,"&lt;ref&gt;''The Orwellian World'', p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; but more importantly focuses on the shifting doctrines and "mental regulating" of Witnesses through isolationism and dogma, comparing the [[Watch Tower Society]]'s closed social paradigms with the thought control depicted by [[George Orwell]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dwayne Janke, "Book fights JW 'Big Brother ways'", ''[[Calgary Herald]]'', 15 May 1984, p. A8; Stephen Weatherbe, "Theocracy girded for the end: An Alberta book says the Jehovah's Witnesses are Orwellian", ''[[Alberta Report]]'', 4 June 1984, pp. 34-38&lt;/ref&gt; Debbie Morgan of the ''[[United Church Observer]]'' called it a "warning against the way religious doctrine can be created and used to enslave rather than to free."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', January 1985, pp. 62-63&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Rapkins of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' described it as "excellent and sophisticated—a rare treat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Q61PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RAYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5725,5184547|title=Former Members of Jehovah's Witness Say Sect Hard To Quit|work=[[Ocala Star-Banner]]|date=1984-05-23|accessdate=2013-01-12}}; Norman Sigurdson, "Nothing sinister here despite charges of thought control", ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' (Saturday 12 May 1984) pp. 54-55; David E.

C8&lt;/ref&gt; Shunned by her many Jehovah's Witness relatives, Botting focused her attention on developing a spiritual religion based on the paganism that her relatives so abhorred.

== University of Victoria ==
Botting  received a second Master of Arts Degree in Religious Studies with a thesis on near death experiences from the University of Calgary before moving with her lawyer husband, [[Gary Botting]], to Victoria, where she joined the faculty of [[University of Victoria]] as an anthropology professor,&lt;ref&gt;http://anthropology.uvic.ca/people/faculty/botting.php&lt;/ref&gt; teaching folklore, anthropology of religion and social justice.&lt;ref&gt;http://anthropology.uvic.ca/people/faculty/&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after joining the faculty of University of Victoria, she was appointed as chaplain&amp;mdash;the first recognized Wiccan university [[chaplain]] in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2010/12/16/pagans-celebrate-solstice-with-yule-rituals/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atccanada.org/services/wiccan-chaplaincy/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coven Celeste ==
In the summer of 1966, Heather Harden met her fiance's maternal grandmother, [[Lysbeth Turner]] (née Rendle), the younger sister of [[Thomas Edward Rendle]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]] the first infantryman to receive the [[Victoria Cross]] in the [[First World War]]. After answering the "call to arms" of [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)]] in 1940—when witches from across the south of England met in the [[New Forest]] for the purpose of casting a protective charm over England and a spell on Hitler's nefarious designs—[[Lysbeth Turner]] had become Gardner's London-based High Priestess. She had introduced [[Gary Botting]] to Gardner in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[[Coven Celeste]], [[Wicca]], [[Aquarian Tabernacle Church]]&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that most of her Canadian family had become committed Jehovah's Witnesses, in 1966 Lysbeth expressed concern to Heather that her tradition of the "Old Religion" (i.e. [[Wicca]]) would be lost forever. Heather had empathy for this situation, since she had grown up in Ontario in the 1950s, when it was not fashionable to admit one's First Nations heritage (in her case, [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]]-[[Sioux]]). Despite her being a Jehovah's Witness, Heather rose to the challenge, abandoned the faith of her youth and was initiated into [[Witchcraft]]. Once they were married later that year, Gary and Heather Botting established [[Coven Celeste]] in [[Peterborough, Ontario]] - the first [[Wiccan]] coven in Canada. However, because of the severe social strictures placed upon them by Jehovah's Witnesses, including fear of being disfellowshipped, they stayed in the "broom closet" for years&amp;mdash;the "gestation period" of Coven Celeste&amp;mdash;discussing their new faith only with fellow pagans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Coven Celeste]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The coven came to full development in [[Sylvan Lake, Alberta|Sylvan Lake]], Alberta, from where it "hived," with different members of the coven moving away, taking its traditions with them. Over the next 40&amp;nbsp;years it went through several permutations, spreading from Ontario east to Newfoundland and west to British Columbia, north to the Northwest Territories, and south as far as Corpus Christi, Texas. In keeping with the matrilineal tradition explained to Heather by [[Lysbeth Turner]], Coven Celeste has been passed on to Heather's granddaughters, Phaydra and Ariadne.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Botting&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aquarian Tabernacle Church ==
Michele Favarger attended [[Coven Celeste]] rituals in Alberta in 1982 and subsequently formed the Canadian [[Aquarian Tabernacle Church]] ("ATC") on [[Vancouver Island]], inviting Heather Botting (as "Lady Aurora") and [[Gary Botting]] (as "Lord Pan") to become founding elders. The Bottings and Favarger, along with Favarger's partner and high priest Erik Lindblad, successfully campaigned the [[Province of British Columbia]] to recognize Wiccan weddings.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Todd, "University of Victoria chaplain marks solstice with pagan rituals," ''Vancouver Sun'', 16 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; By 1995 [[Coven Celeste]] had become one of the mainstay covens of Temple of the Lady in Victoria, BC, and the ATC was conducting a prison ministry and most pagan weddings in the province—mostly led by Arch-Priestess Michele Favarger and High Priestess Lady Aurora.&lt;ref&gt;Todd; http://theroadtoemmaus.org/RdLb/21PbAr/Apl/NeoPgn.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Heather Botting then became High Priestess of Circle of the Wolfsong, the Victoria branch of the ATC, and her husband, Denis O'Brien, became the coven's high priest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aquariantabernaclechurch.org/atc-affiliates-canada&lt;/ref&gt;

== Private life ==
Heather and [[Gary Botting]] have four children, Tanya (born 1970), Trent (born 1975), Thomas (born 1979) and Tharian (born 1983).&lt;ref&gt;''The Orwellian World'', p. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; They were divorced in 1999. In 2000, Heather married social worker Denis O'Brien, a Wiccan of mixed Mohawk and Irish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aquariantabernaclechurch.org/atc-affiliates-canada&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Humboldt University of Berlin''' ({{lang-de|Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin}}, abbreviated '''HU Berlin'''&lt;!--boldface per MOS:BOLDSYN--&gt;) is a university in the central borough of [[Mitte]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It was established by [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] on the initiative of [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Ernst Daniel Schleiermacher as the '''University of Berlin'''&lt;!--boldface per MOS:BOLDSYN--&gt; (''Universität zu Berlin'') in 1809, and opened in 1810,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Das moderne Original der Reformuniversität|url=https://www.hu-berlin.de/de/ueberblick/geschichte|publisher=Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|accessdate=15 January 2018|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the oldest of Berlin's four universities. From 1810 until its closure in 1945, it was named '''Friedrich Wilhelm University'''&lt;!--boldface per MOS:BOLDSYN--&gt; ({{lang-de|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität}}).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Humboldt-University-of-Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;During that period, it was also unofficially called '''Universität unter den Linden'''&lt;!--boldface per MOS:BOLDSYN--&gt; after its location in the former palace of [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1726–1802)|Prince Henry of Prussia]] which his brother, King [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], had built for him between 1748 and 1753 on the avenue [[Unter den Linden]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, under [[Eastern Bloc]] rule, it was reopened and for this occasion received its present-day name.&lt;ref name="dw.com"&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/berlins-oldest-university-faces-new-challenges-as-it-turns-200/a-6106014&lt;/ref&gt;

The university is divided into nine faculties, including its [[Charité|medical school]] shared with the Free University of Berlin, has a student enrollment of around 32,000 students, and offers degree programmes in some 189 disciplines from undergraduate to postdoctorate level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hu-berlin.de/de/ueberblick/humboldt-universitaet-zu-berlin/daten-und-zahlen/standardseite|title=Daten und Zahlen zur Humboldt-Universität — Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|last=hu_adm|website=www.hu-berlin.de|language=de|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main campus is located on the [[Unter den Linden]] boulevard in central Berlin. The university is known worldwide for pioneering the [[Humboldtian model of higher education]], which has strongly influenced other European and Western universities, and the university has been widely called "the mother of all modern universities."&lt;ref&gt;Connell Helen, ''University Research Management Meeting the Institutional Challenge: Meeting the Institutional Challenge'', p. 137, OECD, 2005, {{ISBN|9789264017450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, the Humboldt University of Berlin has been associated with [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|55 Nobel Prize winners]] (including former students, faculty and researchers), and is considered one of the best universities in Europe as well as one of the most prestigious universities in the world for arts and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/faculty-rankings/arts-and-humanities/2014#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=|title=QS World University Rankings by Faculty 2014 - Arts and Humanities|work=Top Universities|accessdate=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2014-15/subject-ranking/subject/arts-and-humanities|title=Subject Ranking 2014-15: Arts &amp; Humanities|work=Times Higher Education|accessdate=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely regarded as the world's preeminent university for the [[natural sciences]] during the 19th and early 20th century, and is linked to major breakthroughs in physics and other sciences by its professors such as [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans C.

==History==

===Early history===
[[Image:Wilhelm von Humboldt Denkmal - Humboldt Universität zu Berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Statue of [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] in front of the main building by artist Paul Otto.]]

The University of Berlin was established on 16 August 1809, on the initiative of the liberal Prussian educational politician [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] by [[Frederick William III of Prussia|King Friedrich Wilhelm III]], during the period of the [[Prussian Reform Movement (1806–1815)|Prussian Reform Movement]]. The university was located in a palace constructed from 1748-1766&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hu-berlin.de/en/about/history/huben_html&lt;/ref&gt; for the late [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1726–1802)|Prince Henry]], the younger brother of [[Frederick the Great]].&lt;ref name="zeit.de"&gt;https://www.zeit.de/wissen/2009-10/200-jahre-humboldt-uni/seite-3&lt;/ref&gt; After his widow and her ninety-member staff moved out, the first unofficial lectures were given in the building in the winter of 1809.&lt;ref name="zeit.de"/&gt; Humboldt faced great resistance to his ideas as he set up the university. He submitted his resignation to the King in April 1810, and was not present when the school opened that fall.&lt;ref name="hu-berlin.de"&gt;https://www.hu-berlin.de/de/service/veranstaltungen/250-jahre-wilhelm-von-humboldt/man-beruft-eben-tuechtige-maenner-und-laesst-die-universitaet-sich-allmaehlich-encadrieren&lt;/ref&gt; The first students were admitted on 6 October 1810, and the first semester started on 10 October 1810, with 256 students and 52 lecturers&lt;ref name="dw.com"/&gt; in faculties of law, medicine, theology and philosophy under rector Theodor Schmalz. The university celebrates 15 October 1810 as the date of its opening.&lt;ref name="hu-berlin.de"&gt;https://www.hu-berlin.de/de/service/veranstaltungen/250-jahre-wilhelm-von-humboldt/man-beruft-eben-tuechtige-maenner-und-laesst-die-universitaet-sich-allmaehlich-encadrieren&lt;/ref&gt; From 1828 to 1945, the school was named the Friedrich Wilhelm University, in honor of its founder. [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], then one of the students, made a comment on the university in 1826: "There is no question here of drinking, duelling and plesant communal outings; in no other university can you find such a passion for work, such an interest for things that are not petty student intrigues, such an inclination for the sciences, such calm and such silence. Compared to this temple of work, the other universities appear like public houses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mclellan |first1=David |title=Karl Marx: A Biography |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=15 |edition= Fourth |accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university has been home to many of Germany's greatest thinkers of the past two centuries, among them the subjective idealist philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], the theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], the absolute idealist philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]], the Romantic legal theorist [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]], the pessimist philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], the objective idealist philosopher [[Friedrich Schelling]], cultural critic [[Walter Benjamin]], and famous physicists [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Max Planck]].

[[Image:Berlin Universitaet um 1850.jpg|thumb|right|Friedrich Wilhelm University in 1850]]

The founders of Marxist theory [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] attended the university, as did poet [[Heinrich Heine]], novelist [[Alfred Döblin]], founder of [[structuralism]] [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], German unifier [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Communist Party of Germany]] founder [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[African American]] [[Pan-Africanism|Pan Africanist]] [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and European unifier [[Robert Schuman]], as well as the influential surgeon [[Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach]] in the early half of the 1800s.

The structure of German research-intensive universities served as a model for institutions like [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Further, it has been claimed that "the 'Humboldtian' university became a model for the rest of Europe [...] with its central principle being the union of teaching and research in the work of the individual scholar or scientist."&lt;ref name="historyandpolicy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-98.html|title=The 'Idea of a University' today|last=Anderson|first=Robert|date=March 2010|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|accessdate=2010-12-09|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlargement===
[[Image:Alexander von Humboldt Denkmal - Humboldt Universität zu Berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Statue of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] outside Humboldt University, from 1883 by artist Reinhold Begas.]]

In addition to the strong anchoring of traditional subjects, such as science, law, philosophy, history, theology and medicine, the university developed to encompass numerous new scientific disciplines. [[Alexander von Humboldt]], brother of the founder William, promoted the new learning. With the construction of modern research facilities in the second half of the 19th Century teaching of the natural sciences began. Famous researchers, such as the chemist [[August Wilhelm Hofmann]], the physicist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], the mathematicians [[Ernst Eduard Kummer]], [[Leopold Kronecker]], [[Karl Weierstrass]], the physicians [[Johannes Peter Müller]], [[Albrecht von Graefe]], [[Rudolf Virchow]] and [[Robert Koch]], contributed to Berlin University's scientific fame.

[[File:Berlin Universität um 1900.jpg|thumb|Friedrich Wilhelm University became an emulated model of a modern university in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century ([[photochrom]] from 1900).&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;4–6&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During this period of enlargement, the university gradually expanded to incorporate other previously separate colleges in Berlin. An example would be the [[Charité]], the Pépinière and the Collegium Medico-chirurgicum. In 1717, King [[Frederick I of Prussia|Friedrich I]] had built a [[quarantine]] house for [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] at the city gates, which in 1727 was rechristened by the "soldier king" [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm:]] "Es soll das Haus die Charité heißen" (It will be called Charité [French for ''charity'']). By 1829 the site became the Friedrich Wilhelm University's medical campus and remained so until 1927 when the more modern University Hospital was constructed.

The university started a [[natural history]] collection in 1810, which, by 1889 required a separate building and became the ''[[Natural History Museum, Berlin|Museum für Naturkunde]]''. The preexisting Tierarznei School, founded in 1790 and absorbed by the university, in 1934 formed the basis of the Veterinary Medicine Facility (Grundstock der Veterinärmedizinischen Fakultät). Also the [[Landwirtschaftliche Hochschule Berlin]] (Agricultural University of Berlin), founded in 1881 was affiliated with the Agricultural Faculties of the University.

===Third Reich===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[University]] --&gt;
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2006-0130, Berlin, Humboldt Universität.jpg|thumb|Friedrich Wilhelm University in 1938]]

After 1933, like all German universities, Friedrich Wilhelm University was affected by the Nazi regime. The rector during this period was [[Eugen Fischer]]. It was from the university's library that some 20,000 [[book]]s by "degenerates" and [[Widerstand|opponents of the regime]] were [[Nazi book burnings|taken to be burned]] on May 10 of that year in the Opernplatz (now the [[Bebelplatz]]) for a demonstration protected by the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] that also featured a speech by [[Joseph Goebbels]]. A monument to this can now be found in the center of the square, consisting of a glass panel opening onto an underground white room with empty shelf space for 20,000 volumes and a plaque, bearing an epigraph from an 1820 work by [[Heinrich Heine]]: "Das war ein Vorspiel nur, dort wo man Bücher verbrennt, verbrennt man am Ende auch Menschen" ("This was but a prelude; where they burn books, they ultimately burn people").

The [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] (German "Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums") resulted in 250 [[Judaism|Jewish]] professors and employees being fired from Friedrich Wilhelm University during 1933/1934 and numerous doctorates being withdrawn. Students and scholars and political opponents of Nazis were ejected from the university and often deported. During this time nearly one third of all of the staff were fired by the Nazis.

===Cold War===
{{more citations needed|date=August 2017}}
{{POV||date=March 2018}}
During the [[Cold War]], the university was located in [[East Berlin]]. It reopened in 1946 as the University of Berlin, but due to communist repression, including the Soviet persecution of liberal and social democrat students, the [[Free University of Berlin]] was established as a de facto western successor in [[West Berlin]] in 1948, with support from the United States, and retaining traditions and faculty members of the old Friedrich Wilhelm University. The name of the Free University refers to West Berlin's perceived status as part of the Western "[[free world]]," in contrast to the "unfree" Communist world in general and the "unfree" communist-controlled university in [[East Berlin]] in particular.
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S92636, Berlin, Humboldt-Universität, Hauptgebäude, Ruine.jpg|thumb|Humboldt University, 1950]]

Almost immediately, the Soviet occupiers started persecuting non-communists and suppressing academic freedom at the university. This led to strong protests within the student body and faculty. Soviet [[NKVD]] [[secret police]] arrested a number of students in March 1947 as a response. The Soviet Military Tribunal in [[Lichtenberg (locality)|Berlin-Lichtenberg]] ruled the students were involved in the formation of a "resistance movement at the University of Berlin", as well as espionage, and were sentenced to 25 years of forced labor. From 1945 to 1948, 18 other students and teachers were arrested or abducted, many gone for weeks, and some taken to the [[Soviet Union]] and [[executed]]. Many of the students targeted by Soviet persecution were active in the liberal or social democratic resistance against the Soviet-imposed communist dictatorship; the German communist party had regarded the social democrats as their main enemies since the early days of the Weimar Republic.[[Image:Berlin Humboldt Uni 1964 day.jpg|thumb|Humboldt University in 1964]]

Since the historical name, Friedrich Wilhelm University, had monarchic origins, the school was officially renamed in 1949. Although the Soviet occupational authorities preferred to name the school after a communist leader, university leaders were able to name it Humboldt University of Berlin, after the two Humboldt brothers, a name that was uncontroversial also in the west and capitalized on the fame of the Humboldt name, which is associated with the [[Humboldtian model of higher education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hu-berlin.de/pr/medien/publikationen/regelmaessig/blz/2009/interview_hansen |title=Die Umbenennung zur "Humboldt-Universität" — Presseportal |language=de|website=Hu-berlin.de |date= |accessdate=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1990 the name was retained due to its uncontroversial and non-communist nature, and because it had been chosen by the university itself as an act of resistance against naming the university after a communist leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hu-berlin.de/ueberblick-en/history/huben_html/huben_html?set_language=en&amp;cl=en |title=Short History — Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin |website=Hu-berlin.de |date= |accessdate=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Germany===
[[Image:Frontansicht des Hauptgebäudes der Humboldt-Universität in Berlin.jpg|thumb|The main building of Humboldt University, located in Berlin's "[[Mitte]]" district ([[Unter den Linden]] boulevard)]]

After the [[German reunification]], the university was radically restructured and all employees were terminated and their positions readvertized. The reasons for the termination were both that the activities at the university under the communist regime had been highly politicized and that membership in the communist party had been the main criterion for employment under the communist regime, while non-communists were systematically discriminated against. The professors were almost entirely replaced with West German professors, several of them from the [[Free University of Berlin]], with no links to communism. Many of the departments, which were considered particularly politicized and tainted by communism, e.g. law, history, philosophy and economics, were entirely dissolved, and new departments with no continuity from the communist-era departments were established. As a result of this purge, the university essentially became a new institution in the West German tradition with little continuity from the institution that existed in East Germany. The [[decommunization]] was carried out more vigorously at the Humboldt University than any other university in the former GDR, and the university has continued to take disciplinary action against employees discovered to have links to the East German communist regime in the 25 years that followed; in 2017 a research assistant was dismissed over his past as a [[Stasi]] cadet, although the disciplinary action was later reduced to a warning and suspension. The Humboldt University has become a leading institution in the research on the crimes of communism in the GDR and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe, with prominent academics such as [[Jörg Baberowski]], an expert on Stalinist violence, genocide and terror against the peoples of Eastern and Central Europe.

Today, Humboldt University is a state university with a large number of students (36,986 in 2014, among them more than 4,662 foreign students) after the model of West German universities, and like its counterpart the [[Free University of Berlin]].

The university consists of three different campuses, namely Campus Mitte, Campus Nord and Campus Adlershof. Its main building is located in the centre of Berlin at the boulevard [[Unter den Linden]] and is the heart of Campus Mitte. The building was erected on order by King [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] for his younger brother [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1726–1802)|Prince Henry of Prussia]]. All the institutes of humanities are located around the main building together with the Department of Law and the Department of Business and Economics. Campus Nord is located north of the main building close to [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]] and is the home of the life science departments including the university medical center [[Charité]]. The natural science together with computer science and mathematics are located at Campus Adlershof in the south-east of Berlin. Furthermore, the university continues its tradition of a book sale at the university gates facing Bebelplatz.

==Organization==
[[Image:Naturkundemuseum Berlin.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Natural History Museum, Berlin|Berlin's Natural History Museum]] (shown here photographed in 2005) is one of the largest natural history museums in the world. Founded alongside the University of Berlin in 1810 it left the Humboldt University in 2009.]]

These are the nine faculties into which the university is divided:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculties and Departments|url=https://www.hu-berlin.de/en/institutions/faculties-and-departments/standardseite?set_language=en|publisher=Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Faculty of [[Law]]
* Faculty of [[Mathematics]] and [[Natural Sciences]] ([[Geography]], [[Computer Science]], [[Mathematics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Physics]])
* Faculty of [[Life Sciences]] ([[Agriculture]] and [[Horticulture]], [[Biology]], [[Psychology]])
* [[Charité]] – Berlin University of [[Medicine]] (jointly with [[Free University of Berlin]])
* Faculty of [[Philosophy]] I ([[Philosophy]], [[History]], European [[Ethnology]], Department of [[Library]] and [[Information Science]])
* Faculty of [[Philosophy]] II ([[Literature]], [[Linguistics]], [[Scandinavian studies|Scandinavian Studies]], [[Romance languages|Romance]] literatures, English and [[American Studies]], [[Slavic Studies]], [[Classical Philology]])
* Faculty of [[Humanities]] and [[Social Sciences]] (Social Sciences, [[Cultural Studies]]/Arts, Asian/African Studies (includes [[Archeology]]), [[Sport science]], [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|Rehabilitation]] Studies, [[Education]], [[Quality Management]] in [[Education]])
* Faculty of [[Theology]]
* Faculty of [[Economics]] and [[Business Administration]]

Furthermore, there are two independent institutes (''Zentralinstitute'') that are part of the university:
* [[Centre for British Studies]] (in German: ''Großbritannienzentrum'')
* Humboldt-Innovation (research transfer and spin-off service)
* ''[[Natural History Museum, Berlin|Museum für Naturkunde]]'' (Natural History Museum)
* [[Späth-Arboretum]]

==Library==
[[Image:Berlin-Mitte Bebelplatz1 05-2014.jpg|thumb|The former Royal Library, now seat of the Faculty of Law]]

When the Royal Library proved insufficient, a new library was founded in 1831, first located in several temporary sites. In 1871–1874 a library building was constructed, following the design of architect Paul Emanuel Spieker. In 1910 the collection was relocated to the building of the [[Berlin State Library]].

During the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Period]] the library contained 831,934 volumes (1930) and was thus one of the leading university libraries in Germany at that time.

During the [[Nazi book burnings]] in 1933, no volumes from the university library were destroyed. Also, the loss through [[World War II]] was comparatively small. In 2003, natural science related books were outhoused to the newly founded library at the [[Adlershof]] campus, which is dedicated solely to the natural sciences.

Since the premises of the State Library had to be cleared in 2005, a new library building is about to be erected close to the main building in the center of Berlin. The "Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm-Zentrum" (Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm Centre, Grimm Zentrum or GZ as it is can be referred to by students) opened in 2009.

In total, the university library contains about 6.5&amp;nbsp;million volumes and 9000 held magazines and journals and is one of the biggest university libraries in Germany.

The books of the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] were destroyed during the Nazi book burnings and the institute destroyed. Under the terms of the Magnus Hirschfeld Foundation, the government had undertaken to continue the work of the institute at the university after its founder's death. However these terms were ignored. In 2001 however the university acquired the Archive for Sexology from the Robert Koch Institute, which was founded on a large private library donated by [[Erwin J. Haeberle]]. This has now been housed at the new Magnus Hirschfeld Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlin and its Sexological Heritage |url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/HISTORY.HTM |publisher=Magnus Hirschfeld Archive for Sexology |author=Erwin J Haeberle" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830062548/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/HISTORY.HTM |archivedate=2009-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''kyōiku mama'' is a stereotyped figure in modern Japanese society portrayed as a mother who relentlessly drives her child to study, to the detriment of the child's social and physical development, and emotional [[Quality of life|well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plexoft.com/SBF/J02.html#juku Kriman, Alfred. "SBF Glossary: Jo. to J-2". 10/25/07]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''kyōiku mama'' is one of the best-known and least-liked [[Popular culture|pop-culture]] figures in contemporary Japan. The ''kyōiku mama'' is analogous to American stereotypes such as the [[stage mother]] who forces her child to achieve show-business success in Hollywood, the stereotypical Chinese [[tiger mother]] who takes an enormous amount of effort to direct much of her maternal influence towards developing their children's educational and intellectual achievement, and the [[Jewish mother stereotype|Jewish mother]]'s drive for her children to succeed academically and professionally, resulting in a push for perfection and a continual dissatisfaction with anything less or the critical, self-sacrificing mother who coerces her child into [[medical school]] or [[law school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Intelligence and How to Get It: Why Schools and Cultures Count |last= Nisbett |first=Richard E. |publisher=WW Norton |year=2010 |isbn=978-0393337693 |publication-date=January 26, 2010 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stereotype is that a ''kyōiku mama'' is feared by her children, blamed by the press for [[school phobia]]s and youth [[suicide]]s, and envied and resented by the mothers of children who study less and fare less well on exams.&lt;ref name="Tobin"&gt;Tobin, Joseph J., David Y.H. Wu, and Dana Davidson. ''Preschool in Three Cultures: Japan, China and the United States''. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="White, Merry I 2002"&gt;White, Merry I. ''Perfectly Japanese: Making Families in an Era of Upheaval''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors influencing development of kyōiku mama==
In the early 1960s, [[Part time|part-time]] women's labor began at a few major corporations in Japan and was adopted by other companies within a decade. It became popular among married women in the 1970s and even more so in 1985.

Women's return to the workplace is often explained in a two-fold way: by financial demands to complement the family budget, and by psychological demands to relate themselves to society.

[[Parenting|Child-rearing]] women in the 1960s inspired the media to produce the idiom kyōiku mama, which referred to "the domestic counterpart of sararii-man"{{attribution needed|date=March 2017}} ([[salaryman]]). This encompassed a major responsibility to "rear children, especially the males, to successfully pass the competitive tests needed to enter high school and college".{{attribution needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref name="Kato, Etsuko 2004"&gt;Kato, Etsuko. ''The Tea Ceremony and Women's Empowerment in Modern Japan: Bodies Re-presenting the Past''. London: Routledge, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; No such idiom emerged that deemed men "education papas"; it was "mamas" who became a social phenomenon.

===The education system===
{{See also|Education in Japan}}
The education system and larger political economy it serves influence why mothers become obsessed with children's education. Social prejudices influence media stereotypes of ''kyōiku mamas'' that blame women rather than political conditions. Getting a good, steady job in the future very much depends on getting into a good university, which depends on attaining high scores on the national university exams in a student's last year of high school. Ordinary people, including mothers, feel powerless to change this system.

As a result, there is a clear map pointing students to the right [[nursery school]] that leads to the right kindergarten, the best elementary school, junior high school, and high school, all of which may be associated with prestigious universities. To ensure these results, some parents have been known to commit unethical or illegal acts to promote their child's success.

In one case, a restaurant owner paid a $95,000 bribe in an attempt to get his child enrolled in [[Aoyama Gakuin]], a prestigious kindergarten for children who are three or four years old. Because of the kindergarten's affiliation with an elite university, parents are willing to go to extreme lengths to get their children enrolled. Aoyama Gakuin has room for 40 new students a year. Every year, it receives more than 2000 hopeful applicants. The tests the potential students take are known to be extremely difficult.&lt;ref name="Hills, Ben 1996"&gt;Hills, Ben. ''Japan Behind the Lines''. Rydalmere, New South Wales: Hodder Headline Australia Pty Limited, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue is compounded by the notion that most important job positions in business and government are held by graduates of the [[University of Tokyo]]. In addition, which university a student attends is believed to affect one's choices for a future spouse. Because a child's life appears to be determined by what schools he or she attends, many mothers take extraordinary measures to get children into good schools.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Robert J. ''Japan-think, Ameri-think: An Irreverent Guide to Understanding the Cultural Differences Between Us''. New York: Penguin Books, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing family structures===
The older generation{{which|date=March 2017}} of Japanese grew up in larger households than those normally found in Japan today. Back then, ''ikuji'' ({{lang|ja|育児}}, "child-raising") included a larger surrounding environment, made up of more relatives and [[extended family]], and more children: siblings and cousins. Children who grew up in that time learned responsibilities through the care of younger siblings. These children relied on themselves in the outside world through much of their childhood lives. In those days, child-raising was more of a private matter, handled only by the child's surrounding family.&lt;ref name="White, Merry I 2002"/&gt;

In the 1970s, men's wages decreased and women left home earlier to find jobs. These women "considered themselves free" after the child's junior high education. The previous generation did not feel this until after the child had finished high school.&lt;ref&gt;Ochiai, Emiko. ''The [[Japanese family|Japanese Family]]'' System in Transition. Tokyo: Yoshikaku Publishing Co., 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary Japan, couples are having fewer children and teaching the children self-reliance. This involves consulting child-raising professionals. This new need in professional advice is commonly termed "child-raising neurosis" by professionals. Reliance on professionals has largely created a new generation of young mothers with low [[Self-esteem|self-confidence]] in their child-raising abilities. Indeed, most Japanese mothers today grew up in smaller families with only one or two children. Their mothers provided them with everything they needed and gave them little to no responsibilities involving their siblings. Thus, that generation of children has grown up to become mothers who have no idea how to raise their children.&lt;ref name="White, Merry I 2002"/&gt;

In addition, in contemporary Japan there are mothers who completely devote themselves to child-raising. Another subtype, described by Nishioka Rice, is the ''kosodate mama'' ({{lang|ja|子育てママ}}), who adds psychosociological elements into child-raising. In addition to providing for her a good education, she develops an emotional and psychological relationship with her children. One way to do this is through "skinship"—being in constant close [[physical contact]] with her children. This could, for example, involve carrying her child on her back wherever she goes or bathing with her children every night. Through skinship, ''ittaikan'' ({{lang|ja|一体感}}) is achieved, a "one-ness and balanced, positively valenced dependency"{{attribution needed|date=March 2017}} between mother and child.&lt;ref name="White, Merry I 2002"/&gt;

===Societal views===
In Japan, a mother who works is commonly seen as selfish in a society where child-raising is linked directly with the physical closeness between mother and child. This emphasis can be a cause of the development of a ''kyōiku mama'' who always worries about her children's education success. This produces children that society views as lacking self-reliance, antisocial, and selfish.&lt;ref name="White, Merry I 2002"/&gt;

When compared to American mothers, Japanese mothers have a stronger belief in effort as opposed to innate ability. Japanese children see their efforts as necessary to fulfill a social obligation to family, peers, and community. Children are forced to focus on their effort, seeing it as the cause of success. According to society, if a child does not succeed, they were not trying hard enough. This is unrelated to the child's grades; children always need to put forth more effort.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Elliot, Julian. Bempechat, Janine. ''Learning in Culture and Context''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers pressure children because they are held strongly accountable for their children's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Julian. Bempechat, Janine. Learning in Culture and Context. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very hard to find daycare in some parts of Japan, and it is socially looked down upon if a mother sends her child to one. The mother is seen as insufficient, not having the skills to raise a child on her own, or selfish, giving her child over to a caretaker while she pursues her own separate goals.&lt;ref name="White, Merry I 2002"/&gt;

The term ''kyōiku mama'' became used in other similar contexts. For example, the former [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] was dubbed ''kyōiku mama'' for its approach and initiatives in guiding industrial growth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ezra Vogel|Vogel, Ezra]], ''Japan as Number One'', Harvard University Press, 1979, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
Housewives are surrounded by popular media that encourages their actions. [[Daytime television]], magazines, products, and services for mothers are largely focused on improving the home and raising the children. Thus, the job of motherhood is taken very seriously by mothers in Japan. A common description of a mother’s [[Leisure|free time]] is “three meals and a nap.”&lt;ref name="White, Merry I 2002"/&gt;

===Class distinctions===
Kyōiku mamas, preparatory preschools, and heavily academic curricula exist in Japan, yet they are relatively rare and concentrated in urban, wealthy areas.&lt;ref name="Tobin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="White, Merry I 2002"/&gt; Kyōiku mamas are prominent in the middle classes. [[Middle class|Middle-class]] women train the children, the next generation of the middle class. In a speech at the 1909 Mitsukoshi children's exhibition, First Higher [[Principal (school)|School principal]] [[Nitobe Inazō]] asserted, "The education of a citizenry begins not with the infant but with the education of a country's mothers."{{cq|date=May 2010}}

In the post-World War II era in Japan, the mother was the creator of a new child-centered world stamped with middle-class values. The mother was linked with the success of the child's education. A woman was expected to be a "good wife, wise mother" and became the single most important figure in raising the child to become a successful future adult. Mothers needed to put their efforts into raising and teaching their children. Through self-cultivation and rearing of the children, the woman was crucial to a family's ability to claim a place in the so-called middle stratum.

As education credentials became the recognized prerequisite to social advancement in the early 20th century, ''kyōiku mama'' actively looked to the education system, especially admission into [[middle school]] for boys and higher school for girls, to help improve the family's [[social position]]. The competition to pass the [[entrance examination]] to middle school and girls' higher school became intense, creating the [[social phenomenon]] known as ''shiken jigoku'' ({{lang|ja|試験地獄}}): examination hell. While ''risshin shusse'' ({{lang|ja|立身出世}}), or rising in the world, was the [[Clarion (instrument)|clarion]] call of the mass of the middle class, there was no ''risshin shusse'' without a ''kyōiku mama''. For the education mother, making the child into a superior student was a concern that began with the child's entrance into elementary school at age six and extended to all aspects of the child's education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proquest.com/ Jones, Mark Alan. ''Children as treasures: Childhood and the middle class in early twentieth-century Japan''. Diss. Columbia University, 2001. ProQuest Digital Dissertations. ProQuest. University of Texas at Austin Libraries 30 October 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Working class|Working-class]] mothers are not as intensely active in their children's education as middle-class mothers. An ethnographic study by Shimizu Tokuda (1991) portrayed one middle school that faced persistent academic problems in a working-class neighborhood of Osaka. The study illustrated efforts by teachers to improve the student’s academic performance: providing tests, promoting monthly teacher discussions, painting walls to enhance the study environment, and restricting hours spent in [[Extracurricular activity|extracurricular activities]]. While students' enrollment in high school slightly improved, academic achievement level remained lower than the national average. This study revealed that students' academic problems were deeply related to their home environments. Most students had parents who were uneducated and not involved in their children's education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proquest.com/ Yamamoto, Yoko. ''Unequal beginnings: Socioeconomic differences in Japanese mothers' support of their children's early schooling''. Diss. University of California, Berkeley, 2006. ProQuest Digital Dissertations. ProQuest. University of Texas at Austin Libraries 30 October 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==American view==
In contrast to Japan's mostly negative images of ''kyōiku mamas'', American leaders who put forth the image of "superhuman Japan" to boost American education performance extolled Japan's education-minded mothers. Both of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s education secretaries focused attention on Japanese mothers as mirrors to improve American families and schools. Reagan's first Secretary of Education, [[Terrel Bell]] (credited for the wording of ''[[A Nation at Risk]]'') wrote an enthusiastic foreword to Guy Odom's ''Mothers, Leadership and Success''—a book whose basic point was that only vigorous, aggressive and intelligent [[Super Mom]]s exemplified by Japanese mothers could reinvigorate America. [[William J. Bennett]], head of the [[Department of Education]] in Reagan's second term, praised Japan's "one parent on the scene" who "stays in touch with the teachers, supervises the homework, arranges extra instructional help if needed, and buttresses the child's motivation to do well in school and beyond".&lt;ref name="Thorsten, Marie 2012"&gt;Thorsten, Marie. ''Superhuman Japan: Nation, Knowledge and Culture in US-Japan Relations''. Routledge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary kyōiku mamas==
Many Japanese mothers dedicate much time to get their children from one entrance exam to another. At the national university entrance exams, held in Tokyo, most mothers travel with their children to the examination hall. They arrive and stay at a nearby hotel, grilling their children on last-minute statistics and making sure that they are not late to the exam.&lt;ref name="Joseph, Joe 1993"&gt;Joseph, Joe. ''The Japanese: Strange But Not Strangers''. London: Viking, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mothers are beginning their children's education at even younger ages. A 30-year-old mother in Japan says, "This is my first baby, and I didn't know how to play with her or help her develop". She sends her 6-month-old daughter to a pre-pre-school in Tokyo. A headmaster at another pre-pre-school claims that the school, for children one year or older, helps to nurture and develop the children's curiosity through "tangerine-peeling or collecting and coloring snow".&lt;ref name="Joseph, Joe 1993"/&gt;

Mothers are essentially in heavy competition with other mothers who want their children to get into the elite universities. In some cases, to make it seem like her own child is not studying as much, mothers will let their child use the parents' bedroom to study while the mothers watch television in the [[living room]]. Other mothers who pass by the house will see the child's bedroom light off, assuming that the child has shirked his or her studies to watch television. The next morning, the mother will report what happened on the shows to her child, who will go to school and talk about it to his or her classmates, who will also assume that their friend is a slacker, lowering their expectations of their friend and for themselves. However, when examination time rolls around, the "slacker" will be admitted into an elite school while his or her friends will drop behind.&lt;ref name="Joseph, Joe 1993"/&gt;&lt;!-- just how common is this sort of thing?!?  In 19 years in Japan, this is the first I've heard of it—yet it's presented here as a common trick --&gt;

''Kyōiku mamas'' often give their children a big first appearance in the neighborhood through a ''kōen debyū'' ({{lang|ja|公園デビュー}}), where the mothers "parade their offspring around the neighborhood parks for approval".{{attribution needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref name="Hills, Ben 1996"/&gt;

Mothers send their children to cram schools ([[juku]]), where children may stay until 10 or 11pm. Japan has over 35,000 cram schools for college examinations.{{when|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref name="Joseph, Joe 1993"/&gt; In addition to cram schools, children are sent to calligraphy, keyboard, abacus, or kendo classes.&lt;ref name="Hills, Ben 1996"/&gt; As revealed by Marie Thorsten, moral panics about juku and education mamas occurred at the same time, in the 1970s. "As 'second schools', the juku, as consumer services, appealed to mothers’ anxieties about their children, shaping the image of the 'normal' mother as one who sends her children to juku and stays up to date with commercialized trends in examination preparation."{{attribution needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten, Marie. ''Superhuman Japan''. Routledge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on children==
{{See also|Hikikomori}}
In the 1950s, full-time mothers devoted themselves to a smaller number of children. Parental stress resulted in the commonality of new childhood problems; these include [[Asthma|bronchial asthma]], stammering, poor appetite, proneness to [[bone fracture]]s, and school phobia. Children were aware they were their mother's purpose in life. Mothers played the role of their children's school teachers while they were at home.&lt;ref&gt;Ochiai, Emiko. ''The Japanese Family System in Transition''. Tokyo: Yoshikaku Publishing Co., 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, a child who grows up with a ''kyōiku mama'' turns into a ''tenuki okusan'' ({{lang|ja|手抜き奥さん}}, "hands-off housewife"). This stereotype describes women who typically have jobs and are not around the children as much, essentially becoming the female version of the stereotypical absent Japanese father, a "leisure-time parent" or "Sunday friend". These mothers are said to not do a lot of homemaking, commonly making large, freezable meals that are easy to reheat in case they are not home or too busy to do the cooking. They do not attempt to represent their families in the community through participation in their children's school PTA and other community functions.&lt;ref name="White, Merry I 2002"/&gt;

Compared to modern American children, Japanese youths have less drug use, depression, violence, and [[teenage pregnancy]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; although these may be caused due to harsher laws and intrinsic social values in the Japanese culture.

==Government regulations==
The [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Japanese Ministry of Education]] has admitted that the education system and parental pressure are taking their toll on children. Education reforms that the Ministry of Education has enacted beginning in the 1970s have challenged Japan’s egalitarian school system. To decrease academic pressure among students from examination competition, the Ministry of Education cut school hours and increased non-academic activities such as recess and clubs in elementary and junior high schools.&lt;ref name="proquest.com"&gt;[http://www.proquest.com/ Yamamoto, Yoko. ''Unequal beginnings: Socioeconomic differences in Japanese mothers' support of their children's early schooling''. Diss. University of California, Berkeley, 2006. ProQuest Digital Dissertations. ProQuest. University of Texas at Austin Libraries 30 Oct. 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the central government reduced school hours again, decreased content, and introduced a new curriculum at all public elementary schools to encourage individual students' learning interests and motivation.&lt;ref name="proquest.com"/&gt; The Japanese Ministry of Education published a [[white paper]] stating that children do not have opportunities such as "coming into contact with nature, feeling awe and respect for life, and experiencing the importance of hard work learning from difficulties".&lt;ref name="Joseph, Joe 1993"/&gt;

==Japanese education and related stress==
Post-war Japan in the 1950s made it a "national mission to accelerate its education program. Children of this era had to distinguish themselves from peers at an early age if they hoped to get into a top university. Entrance exams for these children began in kindergarten.&lt;ref name="Nathan, Jonathan 2004"&gt;Nathan, Jonathan. ''Japan Unbound''. New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s, pressure to achieve in children created the need for specialty schools. Seventy percent of students continued their long school day at juku or "cram schools".&lt;ref name="Nathan, Jonathan 2004"/&gt;

In the 1980s, a series of suicides linked to school pressures began. Elementary and middle school students took their lives after failing entrance exams.&lt;ref name="Nathan, Jonathan 2004"/&gt;

During the 1990s, the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|economic collapse in Japan]] (after its global economic dominance in the previous decade) led to a loss of motivation by students. The once highly touted academic ratings of Japan in math and science fell behind those of American levels. The stress began to lead to classroom disruption.&lt;ref name="Nathan, Jonathan 2004"/&gt;

In 2001, the National Education Research Institute found that 33 percent of teachers and principals polled said that they had witnessed a complete breakdown of class "over a continuous period" due to defiant children "engaging in arbitrary activity".&lt;ref name="Nathan, Jonathan 2004"/&gt; In 2002, the Japanese Education Ministry&amp;nbsp;— pressured by the need to reform&amp;nbsp;— eliminated 30 percent of its [[core curriculum]]. This freed up time for students to learn in groups according to the students' chosen path.&lt;ref name="Nathan, Jonathan 2004"/&gt;

The use of the term ''mukatsuku'', meaning "irritating and troublesome", has been rising in use among students as a description of the feelings they experience of being fed up with teachers, parents, and life.&lt;ref name="Nathan, Jonathan 2004"/&gt;

'''Lucinda Margaret Grealy''' (June 3, 1963 – December 18, 2002) was an Irish-American poet and memoirist who wrote ''Autobiography of a Face'' in 1994. This critically acclaimed book describes her childhood and early adolescent experience with [[cancer]] of the jaw, which left her with some facial disfigurement. In a 1994 interview with Charlie Rose conducted right before she rose to the height of her fame, Lucy states that she considers her book to be primarily about the issue of "identity."

==Life==
Grealy was born in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and her family moved to the [[United States]] in April 1967, settling in [[Spring Valley, New York]].  She was diagnosed at age 9 with a rare form of cancer called [[Ewing's sarcoma]]. Treatment for this often fatal cancer (Grealy reports an estimated 5% survival rate) led to the removal of her jawbone, and over the following years she had many [[Craniofacial surgery|facial]] [[Reconstructive surgery|reconstructive surgeries]]. In her memoir, ''Autobiography of a Face'', Grealy describes her life from the time of her diagnosis and how she weathered the cruelty of schoolmates and others, suffering taunts and endless stares from strangers.

At 18, Grealy entered [[Sarah Lawrence College]] where she made her first real friends and nurtured her love of poetry.  She graduated in 1985 and went on to study at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E6DC1F3DF932A15751C1A9649C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Lucy Grealy, 39, Who Wrote a Memoir on Her Disfigurement | first=Christopher | last=Lehmann-Haupt | date=December 21, 2002 | accessdate=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Iowa]] she lived with fellow writer [[Ann Patchett]]. Their friendship is the subject of Patchett's 2004 memoir ''[[Truth and Beauty: A Friendship]]''.

She taught writing at [[Bennington College]]. She also published a collection of essays in 2000, ''As Seen on TV: Provocations''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookbrowse.com/biographies/index.cfm?author_number=1133 Lucy Grealy author bio]. Bookbrowse.com (2010-07-27). Retrieved on May 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her final reconstructive surgery, Grealy became dependent upon her prescribed painkiller, [[Oxycodone|OxyContin]], as she had earlier with [[codeine]].  She died of a heroin [[overdose]] on December 18, 2002, in [[New York City]], at the age of 39.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E0D71F3DF935A25756C0A9629C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Do You Love Me? | date=May 16, 2004 | accessdate=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/25/biography.features2 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=A friend in need | date=July 25, 2004 | accessdate=May 10, 2016 | first=Elspeth | last=Linder}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her sister, Suellen Grealy, is opposed to Ann Patchett's depiction of Lucy  in ''Truth &amp; Beauty''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/biography/story/0,6000,1277240,00.html |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |title= Hijacked by grief |date= August 6, 2004 |last= Grealy |first= Suellen |accessdate= May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that Patchett and the book's publisher [[Harper Collins]] stole the Grealy family's right to grieve privately.

{{Portal|University}}
The '''Machakos Institute of Technology''' ('''MIT''') is a private institute in [[Machakos]], [[Eastern Province (Kenya)|Eastern Province]], [[Kenya]]. MIT has six schools with an emphasis on social work, community development, and scientific and technological research.

MIT was founded in 2008 in response to the expansion in primary and secondary education in Kenya and a lack of corresponding increase in mid-level training colleges and universities. This led to the inability of majority of [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education|KCSE]] school leavers to access training, leading to a huge training gap.
&lt;!--WOW!! EIGHT-YEAR OLD INFO BELOW!! - I WRITE THIS IN FEB 2016 SO PLEASE UPDATE THIS ARTICLE.
MIT enrolled 300 students and employed 30 faculty members in the 2008/2009 school year.)--&gt;

Traditionally, Model UN has been associated with affluent schools and communities, but in recent years, the activity has expanded to reach more students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/12/model-un-program-inspires-underprivileged-kids_n_1008024.html |title=Model UN Program Inspires Underprivileged Kids |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model UN by Region ==
Model United Nations is popular across the United States, with MUN clubs and conferences being found in every region.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate1"/&gt; However, because of the fact that Model UN is decentralized and has grown autonomously, there are significant differences in how MUN is done between regions.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate3"&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/a-tale-of-two-coasts-5-key-differences-between-west-coast-versus-east-coast-model-un/ |title=A Tale of Two Coasts: 5 Key Differences Between West Coast versus East Coast Model UN |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-03-06 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== East Coast ===

Other conferences in the region include HMUN, hosted by Harvard, [http://www.jhumunc.org/ JHUMUNC] hosted at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]], and NMUN, hosted in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=kbonn |url=http://bestdelegate.com/2014-2015-north-american-college-model-un-final-rankings/ |title=2014-2015 North American College Model UN Final Rankings |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2015-05-27 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] has established a reputation for approaching Model United Nations with an idealistic philosophy, while still emphasizing the academic competition aspect of Model UN and giving awards for delegates. Conferences also evaluate delegates holistically when deciding on the distribution of awards. Crisis committees are especially popular in the Northeast, and lead to this region's conferences having more of a focus on creativity.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate3"/&gt;

=== West Coast ===
The [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] is known for their Model United Nations programs. Naturally stressing the academic side of Model UN, conferences greatly value well-written position papers, not just factoring them into awards decisions, but also giving dedicated awards for them. The popularity of Model United Nations, as well as for the high quality of delegates.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate3"/&gt; West Coast conferences are run by universities, high schools, and interscholastic organizations. [http://bmun.org/ BMUN (Berkeley MUN)], [http://mckennamun.org/ McKennaMUN], and [http://scmun.org/ SCMUN] are popular college conferences for high school delegates. For example, SCMUN (hosted by the University of Southern California), offers advanced debate for high school delegates who are hoping to glean substantive and academic value from Model United Nations conferences. Additionally, high school-run conferences such as Huntington Beach High School's Surf City and Novice Conferences, [http://www.cerritosmun.com/ CHSMUN], and Mira Costa's LAIMUN are all nationally-recognized conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Final 2012-2013 High School Rankings|url = http://bestdelegate.com/final-2012-2013-high-school-rankings/|website = Best Delegate|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Midwest ===
Despite the fact that the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] has fewer conferences than the more established East and West Coast circuits,&lt;ref name="bestdelegate4"&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/model-united-nations-of-the-university-of-chicago-munuc-liveblog-educating-the-midwest/ |title=Model United Nations of the University of Chicago (MUNUC) Liveblog: Educating the Midwest |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-02-05 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; it still has a very developed and distinct Model UN culture that is dominated by small regional conferences (such as Midwest Model UN (MMUN), Model UN at the University of Illinois (MUNI), and large international-level conferences centered around Chicago). While some major conferences are located in [[Michigan]] and [[Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan |url=http://bestdelegate.com/model-united-nations-at-the-university-of-michigan-munum-2013/ |title=Model United Nations at the University of Michigan (MUNUM) 2013 |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2013-01-20 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; most are located in [[Illinois]],&lt;ref name="bestdelegate5"&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/high-school-preseason-rankings/ |title=High School Model UN Preseason Rankings |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in [[Chicago]].

Chicago is a major hub of the Model UN community at large, but maintains a strong sense of independence, and is known to have a characteristic focus on realism and innovative crisis simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emily |url=http://bestdelegate.com/5-things-to-know-about-midwestern-model-un/ |title=5 Things to Know About Midwestern Model UN |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-04-27 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; MUN is mostly seen as an educational political exercise, where the students understanding of the world and power is emphasized, and where awards and resolution writing tend to be de-emphasized.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bestdelegate6"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan |url=http://bestdelegate.com/chicago-international-model-united-nations-conference-cimun-2012/ |title=Politics, Business, and Technology: 3 Takeaways from the Chicago International Model United Nations Conference (CIMUN) |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Midwest's crisis conferences are well-regarded, with ChoMUN and CIMUN being particularly well known for this style.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bestdelegate7"&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/chicago-model-united-nations-chomun-2012-solving-the-worlds-crises/ |title=Chicago Model United Nations (ChoMUN) 2012: Solving the World’s Crises |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Model United Nations of the University of Chicago (MUNUC)]] is the largest high school conference in the Midwest, featuring 27 different committees, with several thousand delegates in attendance.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://munuc.org/ |title=Model United Nations of the University of Chicago |publisher=Munuc.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Model United Nations Development Organization (MUNDO) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modelun.net|title=Welcome to MUNDO! {{!}} Model United Nations Development Organization (MUNDO)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209055313/http://www.modelun.net/|archivedate=February 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; runs the [[Chicago International Model United Nations (CIMUN)]], which featured 24 committees, and welcomed 1300 high school delegates in 2014, its 11th annual conference. CIMUN is known to be among the most innovative and fastest growing Model UN's in the US and features some of the most realistic simulations available for high school students.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Kosmidis |url=http://bestdelegate.com/conference-recap-a-delegates-perspective-on-cimun-chicago-international-model-united-nations-conference/ |title=Conference Recap: A Delegate’s Perspective on CIMUN (Chicago International Model United Nations Conference) |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2014-12-30 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago Model United Nations (ChoMUN), also organized by the University of Chicago, is a prestigious college-level Model UN conference in the region, being well known for its unique simulations, and is known to be one of the best college-level crisis conferences in the US.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate7"/&gt; The American Model United Nations (AMUN), an independent organization, is the largest college-level conference in the Midwest and featured 15 committees. In 2014, AMUN welcomed 1400 delegates from around the US and the globe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amun.org/about-amun/ |title=About AMUN &amp;#124; American Model United Nations |publisher=Amun.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also celebrated its 25th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amun.org/uploads/2014_Conference_Program_lowres.pdf |format=PDF |title=American Model United Nations International : 2014 Conference Program |website=Amun.org |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, more Midwestern teams have also traveled to conferences on the East Coast, raising their profile nationally. High schools, such as the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]], [[St. Ignatius College Prep]], [[Lyons Township High School]], [[Glenbrook South High School]], and [[Carl Sandburg High School]] have performed well at large East Coast conferences and have become particularly well-known.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bestdelegate5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/final-2012-2013-high-school-rankings/ |title=Final 2012-2013 High School Rankings |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2013-05-29 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; University teams have also been successful, such as UChicago's team which in both 2013 and 2014 was ranked the best college Model UN team in North America, the first team to twice achieve this feat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bestdelegate.com/model-un-rankings/ |title=Rankings |publisher=Best Delegate |date= |accessdate=2016-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126014202/http://bestdelegate.com/model-un-rankings/ |archivedate=2016-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other teams like &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/hnmun-and-mcmun-tie-as-best-north-american-conference-of-2013-2014/ |title=HNMUN and McMUN Tie as Best North American Conference of 2013-2014 |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2014-05-21 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alma College, UW Oshkosh and University of Illinois - Chicago have made a name for themselves at larger conferences like National Model UN (NMUN) and American Model UN (AMUN), and at regional conferences like Midwest Model UN (MMUN).

In addition to the city of Chicago, several Minnesota teams have become major players in conferences around the country. In the 2010-2011 season, Cambridge-Isanti finished the year ranked 14th in the best delegate national rankings after finishing the equivalent of second at MUNUC and winning awards at UMMUC.   Edina High School hosts the only student run conference in Minnesota, often attracting up to four hundred high school delegates from over twelve metropolitan schools. Edina High School and Cambridge-Isanti High School are still ranked in the top 150 high school programs in the country by Best Delegate. Other notable Minnesota teams include Minnetonka High School and the Blake School.

=== South ===
Middle school Model UN is fairly popular in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdelegate.com/top-12-scheduling-and-market-trends-from-the-2011-12-model-un-conference-calendar/ |title=Top 12 Model UN Conference Scheduling and Market Trends in 2011-12 |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vibrant South region of Model UN in the U.S. can be easily divided into three sub-regions, San Antonio, Texas, Southwest Florida,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/southwest-florida-model-un-powerhouse/ |title=How Southwest Florida High Schools Have Become National Powerhouses in Model UN |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Virginia. All excel at Model UN and have distinct styles.

=== Puerto Rico ===
In [[Puerto Rico]], students are [[multilingualism|bilingual]] and speeches in committee are therefore allowed to be made in either [[English language|English]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. It should be noted however that Spanish is used slightly more often.

The speaking style of Puerto Rican Model UN delegates tends to be more animated than that of other delegates.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Students often speak louder and faster, and when delivering speeches, they may pace in front of their committee instead of standing still.

After a speech, if a delegate wishes to ask a question of the speaker they must ask “Delegates, will you accept my question?” before being able to address the speaker. This is a practice isolated to Puerto Rico, and delegates may be penalized by their chairs if they fail to adhere to it.

Chairs in Puerto Rico adopt a more activist approach, directing the flow of debate and banging their gavels often. This is in comparison to the facilitator style of chairing more common in the rest of the United States which allows delegates to direct more of the flow of debate.

Parents in Puerto Rico are highly supportive of Model UN and some are even [[alumni]]. It is not uncommon for parents to volunteer to help at conferences, and many are present at closing ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/the-only-formal-circuit-in-the-world-structural-and-cultural-lessons-from-la-federacion-in-puerto-rico/ |title=The Only Formal Circuit in the World: Structural and Cultural Lessons from La Federación in Puerto Rico |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/puerto-rico-lo-hace-mejor-how-model-un-is-part-of-the-culture-and-why-puerto-ricans-do-it-better/ |title=Puerto Rico Lo Hace Mejor: How Model UN is Part of the Culture and Why Puerto Ricans Do It Better |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-03-07 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nikita |url=http://bestdelegate.com/crisis-simulations-a-puerto-rican-perspective/ |title=Crisis Simulations- A Puerto Rican Perspective |publisher=Best Delegate |date= |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Tertiary Education Union''' ('''NTEU''') is an [[Australia]]n [[trade union]] for all higher education and university employees. It is an industry union and the only union working exclusively in the Australian university sector.

[[Image:20051115 Australia NSW Sydney IRProtest NTEU.jpg|right|thumb|NTEU workers protest [[John Howard|Howard's]] [[Industrial Relations|IR reforms]]]]

==Overview==
NTEU is a specialist national union solely representing staff in tertiary education.  In all [[Australian universities]], NTEU represents professional staff, academic staff, research staff, general staff, ELICOS teachers, and staff of Student Unions and university companies.  In Victoria, NTEU also represents TAFE general staff and all staff in Adult Education.

NTEU is a relatively recent union, formed out of previous tertiary education staff associations, principally the Federation of University Staff Associations and the Federation of College Academics. It is generally considered to be more towards the left of the union movement, and has a high focus on self-directed membership branches and the [[organising model]] of unionism. The NTEU often engages in organising campaigns to build its membership density.

The NTEU is not affiliated with any Australian political party.

==Campaigns==

'''Our Universities Matter''' is a major national campaign being run by NTEU, launched in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091013115340/http://www.ouruniversitiesmatter.com.au/ Our Universities Matter Official Campaign Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign seeks to:

* Achieve higher levels of government funding and better funding mechanisms.
* Protect university independence and freedom of inquiry.
* Introduce controls on excessive workloads, better job security and a competitive pay rise for university staff.
* Win a better deal for students around affordability and improved student services.

'''Academic Freedom Watch''' is a site established to promote academic freedom in Australia's universities. Created by the Victorian Division, the site includes debates and articles written by high-profile academics in this area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academicfreedom.com.au Academic Freedom Watch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026021505/http://www.academicfreedom.com.au/ |date=2008-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our TAFEs Matter''' is the campaign to promote Victoria's TAFE system, which is being undermined by changes in funding systems by the Victorian Government. The changes would introduce a HECS-style loan scheme, more than double student fees and reduce public TAFE funding certainty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourtafesmatter.com.au Our TAFEs Matter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922100614/http://www.ourtafesmatter.com.au/ |date=2008-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The NTEU publishes:

*''Advocate'' - a monthly journal
*''Australian Universities' Review'' - a scholarly journal ({{issn|0818-8068}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aur.org.au/ Australian Universities' Review]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Agenda'' - a women's publication
*''Connect'' - a twice yearly publication for [[university]] casuals
*''Nexus'' - a regular publication for NTEU members in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] 
*''Sentinel'' - a yearly publication for NTEU members in  [[New South Wales]]
*''Yarn'' - a biannual publication for [[Indigenous Australian]] NTEU members

[[File:Book 'Onna daigaku', The Great Learning for Women, this edition 1783 AD - Hirata Folk Art Museum - Takayama, Gifu, Japan - DSC06779.jpg|thumb|right|Onna daigaku, this edition 1783 AD]]

The '''''Onna Daigaku''''', ({{Nihongo2|女大学|help=yes}}, or "The Great Learning for Women") is an 18th-century Japanese educational text advocating for neo-Confucian values in education, with the oldest existing version dating to 1729. It is frequently attributed to Japanese botanist and educator [[Kaibara Ekken]].

==Education of women==
The ''Onna Daigaku'' is cited as Ekken's most popular book, which was often gifted to new brides due to its accessible tone and a lack of general instructional materials for new families.&lt;ref name=Cranmer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cranmer-Byng|first1=L.|title=Women and Wisdom of Japan|date=1905|publisher=John Murray|location=Albemarle Street, London|isbn=978-1437366136|url=https://archive.org/stream/womenwisdomofjap00kaib/womenwisdomofjap00kaib_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It teaches the moral need for total subordination of women to the needs to the husband and family.&lt;ref name=deBary&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Bary|first1=Theodore|last2=Gluck|first2=Carol|last3=Tiedemann|first3=Arthur|title=Sources of Japanese tradition.|date=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0231121393|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book suggests that women are too stupid to trust themselves, and must "distrust herself and obey her husband".&lt;ref name=deBary /&gt; Scholars point to the wide circulation of the text as reflective of [[Edo period|Edo-period]] [[misogyny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernstein|first1=ed. with an introd. by Gail Lee|title=Recreating Japanese women, 1600–1945|date=1991|publisher=University of California press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520070172}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was roundly criticized by advocates of women's education during the Meiji era.&lt;ref name=Okuma&gt;{{cite book|last1=Okuma|first1=Shigenobu|title=Fifty Years of New Japan|date=1903|publisher=Smith, Elder, &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seven grounds for divorce===
The book encourages several grounds for a husband to divorce his wife, including disobedience to her in-laws, infertility (unless a barren woman allows for adoption of a concubine's child), lewdness, jealousy, leprosy, talking too much, or compulsive thievery.&lt;ref name=deBary /&gt;

==Chapter contents==
* (1) As girls grow, they must prepare to be wives and to serve their husbands and parents.
* (2) Character is more important than appearance. Be obedient, chasteful, compassionate, and modest.
* (3) Girls are different from boys.
* (4) The Seven Grounds for Divorce.
* (5) When married, serve your husband's parents more than your own.
* (6) A wife serves her husband as the lord.
* (7) Honor your husband's brothers and relatives.
* (8) Do not be jealous about your husband, and talk calmly.
* (9) Do not gossip.
* (10) A wife must be diligent. Women under 40 should avoid places where many people gather, such as kabuki, shrines, and temples.
* (11) Do not rely on Buddha too much.
* (12) Make every effort to save money.
* (13) Young wives should not approach young men.
* (14) Clothes should be clean but not showy.
* (15) Focus on your relationship with your husband.
* (16) Do not enter the house of anyone else.
* (17) It is the ladies' pilgrimage that even if you put a servant, you are not left to trust, but are willing to pay for their own labor.
* (18) The chattery lady is dismissed, discipline is neat, when giving a reward, give it without being shy.
* (19) Be obedient, do not be angry, and do not say bad things about people.

The '''Piltdown Man''' was a [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropological]] hoax in which bone fragments were presented as the [[fossil]]ised remains of a previously unknown [[human evolution|early human]]. In 2016, the results of an extensive scientific review established that amateur archaeologist [[Charles Dawson]] had very likely perpetrated  the hoax.&lt;ref name="ArticleBBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Webb|first1=Jonathan|title=Piltdown review points decisive finger at forger Dawson|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37021144|accessdate=19 November 2018|publisher=BBC|date=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1912, Charles Dawson claimed that he had discovered the "missing link" between ape and man. In February 1912, Dawson contacted [[Arthur Smith Woodward]], Keeper of Geology at the [[Natural History Museum]], stating he had found a section of a human-like skull in [[Pleistocene]] gravel beds near [[Piltdown, East Sussex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spencer |first1=Frank |title=The Piltdown papers, 1908-1955 : the correspondence and other documents relating to the Piltdown forgery |date=1990 |publisher=Natural History Museum Publications |isbn=0198585233}}&lt;/ref&gt; That summer, Dawson and Smith Woodward purportedly discovered more bones and artifacts at the site, which they connected to the same individual. These finds included a [[human mandible|jawbone]], more skull fragments, a set of teeth, and primitive tools.

Smith Woodward reconstructed the skull fragments and hypothesised that they belonged to a human ancestor from 500,000 years ago. The discovery was announced at a Geological Society meeting and was given the [[Binomial nomenclature|Latin name]] ''Eoanthropus dawsoni'' ("Dawson's dawn-man"). The questionable significance of the assemblage remained the subject of considerable controversy until it was conclusively exposed in 1953 as a forgery. It was found to have consisted of the altered [[mandible]] and some teeth of an [[orangutan]] deliberately combined with the [[cranium]] of a fully developed, though small-brained, [[modern human]].

The Piltdown hoax is prominent for two reasons: the attention it generated around the subject of human [[evolution]], and the length of time, 41 years, that elapsed from its alleged initial discovery to its definitive exposure as a composite forgery.

==Find==
[[Image:Piltdown man.jpg|thumb|Piltdown Man skull reconstruction]]
At a meeting of the [[Geological Society of London]] on 18 December 1912, Charles Dawson claimed that a workman at the Piltdown gravel pit had given him a fragment of the skull four years earlier. According to Dawson, workmen at the site discovered the skull shortly before his visit and broke it up in the belief that it was a fossilised [[coconut]]. Revisiting the site on several occasions, Dawson found further fragments of the skull and took them to [[Arthur Smith Woodward]], keeper of the geological department at the [[British Museum]]. Greatly interested by the finds, Woodward accompanied Dawson to the site. Though the two worked together between June and September 1912, Dawson alone recovered more skull fragments and half of the lower jaw bone.&lt;ref name = lewin&gt;{{citation |first=Roger |last=Lewin |authorlink=Roger Lewin |url=http://www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_expose/chain_of_fraud.html |title=Bones of Contention |year = 1987 |isbn=0-671-52688-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Piltdown Man: The Secret Life of Charles Dawson | first=Miles |last=Russell | publisher=Tempus, Stroud | year=2003 | pages=157–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skull unearthed in 1908 was the only find discovered [[In situ#Archaeology|in situ]], with most of the other pieces found in the gravel pit's spoil heaps.

At the same meeting, Woodward announced that a reconstruction of the fragments indicated that the skull was in many ways similar to that of a modern human, except for the [[occiput]] (the part of the skull that sits on the [[Vertebral column|spinal column]]), and [[brain size]], which was about two-thirds that of a modern human. He went on to indicate that, save for two human-like [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] teeth, the jaw bone was indistinguishable from that of a modern, young [[chimpanzee]]. From the British Museum's reconstruction of the skull, Woodward proposed that Piltdown Man represented an evolutionary [[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]] between apes and humans, since the combination of a human-like cranium with an ape-like jaw tended to support the notion then prevailing in England that human evolution began with the brain.
[[File:PSM V82 D210 Reconstruction of Eoanthropus dawsoni.png|thumb|left|upright|A 1913 reconstruction of "''Eoanthropus dawsoni''"]]
Almost from the outset, Woodward's reconstruction of the Piltdown fragments was strongly challenged by some researchers. At the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]], copies of the same fragments used by the British Museum in their reconstruction were used to produce an entirely different model, one that in brain size and other features resembled a modern human. This reconstruction, by Prof. (later Sir) [[Arthur Keith]], was called ''Homo piltdownensis'' in reflection of its more human appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keith | first1 = A | year = 1914 | title = The Significance of the Skull at Piltdown | url = | journal = Bedrock | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 435–453 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The find was also considered legitimate by [[Otto Schoetensack]] who had discovered the [[Homo heidelbergensis|Heidelberg fossils]] just a few years earlier; he described it as being the best evidence for an ape-like ancestor of modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Miles. 2012. The Piltdown Man Hoax: Case Closed. History press. p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; French Jesuit [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] and [[Geology|geologist]] [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] participated in the uncovering of the Piltdown skull with Woodward.

Woodward's reconstruction included ape-like [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]], which was itself controversial. In August 1913, Woodward, Dawson and Teilhard de Chardin began a systematic search of the spoil heaps specifically to find the missing canines. Teilhard de Chardin soon found a canine that, according to Woodward, fitted the jaw perfectly. A few days later, Teilhard de Chardin moved to France and took no further part in the discoveries. Noting that the tooth "corresponds exactly with that of an ape",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Woodward |first=A. Smith |authorlink=Arthur Smith Woodward|url=http://www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_report_finds/note_pilt_man.html |journal=The Geological Magazine |title=Note on the Piltdown Man (Eoanthropus Dawsoni) |year=1913 |doi=10.1017/S0016756800127426 |volume=10 |issue=10 |pages=433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodward expected the find to end any dispute over his reconstruction of the skull. However, Keith attacked the find. Keith pointed out that human molars are the result of side to side movement when chewing. The canine in the Piltdown jaw was impossible as it prevented side to side movement. To explain the wear on the molar teeth, the canine could not have been any higher than the molars. [[Grafton Elliot Smith]], a fellow anthropologist, sided with Woodward, and at the next Royal Society meeting claimed that Keith's opposition was motivated entirely by ambition. Keith later recalled, "Such was the end of our long friendship."&lt;ref name=unraveling&gt;{{cite book |author=Walsh, John E. |year=1996 |title=Unraveling Piltdown: The Science Fraud of the Century and its Solution |publisher=Random House |isbn=0-679-44444-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1913, David Waterston of [[King's College London]] published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' his conclusion that the sample consisted of an ape mandible and human skull.&lt;ref name="Gould"/&gt; Likewise, French [[paleontologist]] [[Marcellin Boule]] concluded the same thing in 1915. A third opinion from the American [[zoologist]] [[Gerrit Smith Miller]] concluded that Piltdown's jaw came from a fossil ape. In 1923, [[Franz Weidenreich]] examined the remains and correctly reported that they consisted of a modern human cranium and an [[orangutan]] jaw with filed-down teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacRitchie |first=Finlay |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ja351EkKUDsC&amp;pg=PA30 |title=Scientific Research as a Career |publisher=CRC Press |page=30 |isbn=1439869650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sheffield Park find===
In 1915, Dawson claimed to have found three fragments of a second skull (Piltdown II) at a new site about two miles away from the original finds.&lt;ref name=lewin/&gt; Woodward attempted several times to elicit the location from Dawson, but was unsuccessful. So far as is known, the site was never identified and the finds appear largely undocumented. Woodward did not present the new finds to the Society until five months after Dawson's death in August 1916 and deliberately implied that he knew where they had been found. In 1921, [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], President of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], examined the Piltdown and Sheffield Park finds and declared that the jaw and skull belonged together "without question" and that the Sheffield Park fragments "...were exactly those which we should have selected to confirm the comparison with the original [[Type (biology)|type]]."&lt;ref name=unraveling/&gt;

The Sheffield Park finds were taken as proof of the authenticity of the Piltdown Man; it may have been chance that brought an ape's jaw and a human skull together, but the odds of its happening twice were slim. Even Keith conceded to this new evidence, though he still harbored personal doubts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Craddock |first=Paul |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xYHjpNjimsoC&amp;pg=PT615 |title=Scientific Investigation of Copies, Fakes and Forgeries |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=1-136-43601-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorial==
[[Image:Piltdown man memorial.jpg|thumb|upright|The Piltdown Man memorial stone.]]
On 23 July 1938, at Barkham Manor, Piltdown, Sir [[Arthur Keith]] unveiled a memorial to mark the site where Piltdown Man was discovered by Charles Dawson. Sir Arthur finished his speech saying:

{{quote|So long as man is interested in his long past history, in the vicissitudes which our early forerunners passed through, and the varying fare which overtook them, the name of Charles Dawson is certain of remembrance. We do well to link his name to this picturesque corner of Sussex—the scene of his discovery. I have now the honour of unveiling this monolith dedicated to his memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_report_finds/pilt_man_discover.html The Piltdown Man Discovery], ''Nature'', July 30, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The inscription on the memorial stone reads:

{{quote|Here in the old river gravel Mr Charles Dawson, FSA found the fossil skull of Piltdown Man, 1912–1913, The discovery was described by Mr Charles Dawson and Sir Arthur Smith Woodward, ''Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society'', 1913–15.}}

==Exposure==

===Scientific investigation===

From the outset, some scientists expressed scepticism about the Piltdown find (see above). [[Gerrit Smith Miller|G.S. Miller]], for example, observed in 1915 that "deliberate malice could hardly have been more successful than the hazards of deposition in so breaking the fossils as to give free scope to individual judgment in fitting the parts together".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Miller | first=Gerrit S. | title=The Jaw of the Piltdown Man| journal= Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections | volume=65 | issue=12 |page=1 | date=November 24, 1915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades prior to its exposure as a forgery in 1953, scientists increasingly regarded Piltdown as an enigmatic aberration inconsistent with the path of hominid evolution as demonstrated by fossils found elsewhere.&lt;ref name=lewin/&gt;

In November 1953, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published evidence gathered variously by [[Kenneth Page Oakley]], [[Wilfrid Le Gros Clark|Sir Wilfrid Edward Le Gros Clark]] and [[Joseph Weiner]] proving that the Piltdown Man was a forgery&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,823171,00.html End as a Man. ''Time Magazine'' 30 Nov 1953] retrieved 11 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrating that the fossil was a composite of three distinct species. It consisted of a human skull of medieval age, the 500-year-old lower jaw of an [[orangutan]] and [[chimpanzee]] fossil teeth. Someone had created the appearance of age by staining the bones with an iron solution and [[chromic acid]]. Microscopic examination revealed file-marks on the teeth, and it was deduced from this that someone had modified the teeth to a shape more suited to a human diet.

The Piltdown Man hoax succeeded so well because, at the time of its discovery, the scientific establishment believed that the large modern brain preceded the modern [[omnivore|omnivorous]] diet, and the forgery provided exactly that evidence. It has also been thought that nationalism and cultural prejudice played a role in the less-than-critical acceptance of the fossil as genuine by some British scientists.&lt;ref name=Gould&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen J. |last=Gould |authorlink=Stephen J. Gould |title=The Panda's Thumb |year=1980 |publisher=W. W. Norton |pages=108–24 |isbn=0-393-01380-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It satisfied European expectations that the earliest humans would be found in [[Eurasia]], and the British, it has been claimed,&lt;ref name=Gould/&gt; also wanted a ''first Briton'' to set against fossil hominids found elsewhere in Europe.

===Identity of the forger===
The identity of the Piltdown forger remains unknown, but suspects have included Dawson, [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], [[Arthur Keith]], [[Martin Hinton|Martin A. C. Hinton]], [[Horace de Vere Cole]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]].&lt;ref&gt;Lukas, Mary (May 1981). [http://www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_prim_suspects/teilhard_de_chardin/Chardin_defend/teilhardandpilthoax(lukas).html "Teilhard and the Piltdown 'Hoax'"]. ''America''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Kate (17 February 2011). [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/archaeology/piltdown_man_01.shtml "Piltdown Man: Britain's Greatest Hoax"]. BBC History.&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus on Charles Dawson as the main forger is supported by the accumulation of evidence regarding other archaeological hoaxes he perpetrated in the decade or two before the Piltdown discovery. The archaeologist [[Miles Russell]] of [[Bournemouth University]] analysed Dawson's antiquarian collection, and determined that at least 38 of his specimens were fakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Piltdown Man: The Secret Life of Charles Dawson | first=Miles |last=Russell | publisher=Tempus | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=The Piltdown Man Hoax: Case Closed | first=Miles |last=Russell | publisher=The History Press | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these were the teeth of a reptile/mammal hybrid, ''Plagiaulax dawsoni'', "found" in 1891 (and whose teeth had been filed down in the same way that the teeth of Piltdown Man were to be some 20 years later); the so-called "shadow figures" on the walls of [[Hastings Castle]]; a unique hafted stone axe; the [[Bexhill-on-Sea|Bexhill]] boat (a hybrid seafaring vessel); the [[Pevensey]] bricks (allegedly the latest datable "finds" from Roman Britain); the contents of the [[Lavant, West Sussex|Lavant Caves]] (a fraudulent "flint mine"); the [[Beauport Park]] "Roman" statuette (a hybrid iron object); the [[Bulverhythe]] Hammer (shaped with an iron knife in the same way as the Piltdown elephant bone implement would later be); a fraudulent "Chinese" bronze vase; the Brighton "Toad in the Hole" (a [[Entombed animal|toad entombed]] within a flint nodule); the English Channel sea serpent; the [[Uckfield]] Horseshoe (another hybrid iron object) and the [[Lewes]] Prick Spur. Of his antiquarian publications, most demonstrate evidence of plagiarism or at least naive referencing, Russell wrote: "Piltdown was not a 'one-off' hoax, more the culmination of a life's work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Russell | first=Miles | title=Charles Dawson: 'The Piltdown faker' |publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3285163.stm | date= 23 November 2003 | accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Harry Morris, an acquaintance of Dawson, had come into possession of one of the flints obtained by Dawson at the Piltdown gravel pit. He suspected that it had been artificially aged – "stained by C. Dawson with intent to defraud". He remained deeply suspicious of Dawson for many years to come, though he never sought to discredit him publicly, possibly because it would have been an argument against the [[eolith]] theory, which Morris strongly supported.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, ''The Piltdown Forgery'', pp. 140–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Adrian Lister of the [[Natural History Museum, London|UK's Natural History Museum]] has said that "some people have suggested" that there may also have been a second 'fraudster' seeking to use outrageous fraud in the hope of anonymously exposing the original frauds. This was a theory first proposed by [[Miles Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=The Piltdown Man Hoax: Case Closed | first=Miles |last=Russell | publisher=The History Press | year=2012 | pages=140–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has explained that the piece nicknamed the 'cricket bat' (a fossilised elephant bone) was such a crudely forged 'early tool' that it may have been planted to cast doubt upon the other finds, the 'Earliest Englishman' in effect being recovered with the earliest evidence for the game of cricket. This seems to have been part of a wider attempt, by disaffected members of the Sussex archaeological community, to expose Dawson's activities, other examples being the obviously fraudulent 'Maresfield Map', the 'Ashburnham Dial', and the 'Piltdown Palaeolith'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Piltdown Man: The Secret Life of Charles Dawson | first=Miles |last=Russell | publisher=Tempus | year=2003 | pages=141–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=The Piltdown Man Hoax: Case Closed | first=Miles |last=Russell | publisher=The History Press | year=2012 | pages=129–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the 'cricket bat' was accepted at the time, even though it aroused the suspicions of some and ultimately helped lead to the eventual recognition of the fraud decades later.&lt;ref name=Lister01a&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-20729787|title=The infamous Piltdown 'cricket bat'|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=16 December 2012 |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple specimens demonstrated the same consistent preparation: application of the stain, packing of crevices with local gravel, and fixation of teeth and gravel with dentist's putty. Analysis of shape and trace [[DNA]] showed that teeth from both sites belonged to the same orangutan.&lt;ref name="ArticleBBC"/&gt; The consistent method and common source indicated the work of one person on all the specimens, and Dawson was the only one associated with Piltdown II. The authors did not rule out the possibility that someone else provided the false fossils to Dawson, but ruled out several other suspects, including Teilhard de Chardin and Doyle, based on the skill and knowledge demonstrated by the forgeries, which closely reflected ideas fashionable in biology at the time.

Stephen Jay Gould judges that [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] was the main culprit of the Piltdown forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|o6g2tvN0nJoC|Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes: Further Reflections in Natural History|page=199—226|keywords=|text=|plainurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teilhard de Chardin had travelled to regions of Africa where one of the anomalous finds originated, and resided in the [[Wealden]] area from the date of the earliest finds. Hinton left a trunk in storage at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London that in 1970 was found to contain animal bones and teeth carved and stained in a manner similar to the carving and staining on the Piltdown finds. [[Phillip Tobias]] implicated Arthur Keith in helping Dawson by detailing the history of the investigation of the hoax, dismissing other theories, and listing inconsistencies in Keith's statements and actions.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip V.

[[File:Sterkfontein Caves 1.jpg|thumb|A replica of the Piltdown Man skull.]]

===Early humans===
In 1912, the majority of the scientific community believed the Piltdown Man was the “[[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]]” between apes and humans. However, over time the Piltdown Man lost its validity, as other discoveries such as [[Taung Child]] and [[Peking Man]] were found. R. W. Ehrich and G. M. Henderson note, “To those who are not completely disillusioned by the work of their predecessors, the disqualification of the Piltdown skull changes little in the broad evolutionary pattern. The validity of the specimen has always been questioned.”&lt;ref&gt;"Culture area", in ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', vol. 3, pp. 563–68. (New York: Macmillan/The Free Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, during the 1940s and 1950s, more advanced dating technologies, such as the [[Fluorine absorption dating|fluorine absorption test]], proved scientifically that this skull was actually a fraud.

===Influence===
{{Globalize/Eng|date=September 2014}}
The Piltdown Man fraud significantly affected early research on human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/science-of-natural-history/the-scientific-process/piltdown-man-hoax/ Natural History Museum: "Piltdown Man – the greatest hoax in the history of science?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, it led scientists down a [[cul-de-sac#Other uses|blind alley]] in the belief that the human brain expanded in size before the jaw adapted to new types of food. Discoveries of [[Australopithecine]] fossils such as the [[Taung child]] found by [[Raymond Dart]] during the 1920s in South Africa were ignored due to the support for Piltdown Man as "the missing link," and the reconstruction of human evolution was confused for decades. The examination and debate over Piltdown Man caused a vast expenditure of time and effort on the fossil, with an estimated 250+ papers written on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Washburn|first=S.L.|date=1953|title=The Piltdown Hoax|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1525/aa.1953.55.5.02a00340/asset/aa.1953.55.5.02a00340.pdf;jsessionid=00BC7B49DABDD1C005CB6E298CD43BC8.f04t03?v=1&amp;t=j32b9i78&amp;s=533537981e76f853148d65977fda7ce9d9b3605f|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=55|issue=5|pages=759–62|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1525/aa.1953.55.5.02a00340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fossil was introduced as evidence by [[Clarence Darrow]] in defense of John Scopes during the 1925 [[Scopes Monkey Trial]]. Darrow died in 1938, fifteen years before Piltdown Man was exposed as a fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0418.html|title=Clarence Darrow Is Dead in Chicago|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 14, 1938|accessdate=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Creationism|Creationists]] often cite the hoax (along with [[Nebraska Man]]) as evidence of an alleged dishonesty of paleontologists who study human evolution, despite the fact that scientists themselves had exposed the Piltdown hoax (and the Nebraska Man incident was not a deliberate fraud).&lt;ref name=talkorg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/piltdown.html|title = Creationist Arguments: Piltdown Man|last=Harter|first=Richard|year=1997|accessdate=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_expose/piltdown_hoax.html|last=Caroll|first=Robert Todd|title=Piltdown Hoax|accessdate=29 August 2007|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2003, the Natural History Museum in London held an exhibition to mark the 50th anniversary of the exposure of the fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/corporate-information/annual-reports/report/report2004/text/ouryear.html|title=The Natural History Museum Annual Review 2003/2004|accessdate=17 November 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051105143956/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/corporate-information/annual-reports/report/report2004/text/ouryear.html |archivedate= 2005-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century science===
The Piltdown case is an example of how racial and nationalist factors shaped some science at the time. Piltdown's semi-human features were explained by reference to non-white ethnicities whom some Europeans of that time considered a lower form of human.&lt;ref name="Goulden2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goulden | first1 = M.| title = Boundary-work and the human–animal binary: Piltdown Man, science and the media| doi = 10.1177/0963662507081239| journal = Public Understanding of Science| volume = 18| issue = 3| pages = 275–91|date=May 2009| url = https://zenodo.org/record/1005522/files/article.pdf}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of nationalism is clear in the differing interpretations of the find: whilst the majority of British scientists accepted the discovery as "the earliest Englishman",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=A. Smith |authorlink=Arthur Smith Woodward |url=http://www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_report_finds/earliest_english.html |title=The Earliest Englishman |year=1948 |publisher=Watts &amp; Co. |series=[[Thinker's Library]] |volume=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; European and American scientists were considerably more sceptical, and several suggested at the time that the skull and jaw were from two different creatures and had been accidentally mixed up.&lt;ref name="Goulden2009"/&gt; Regarding the sex of the find, it was discussed as a male, although Woodward suggested that the specimen discovered might be female. The only exception to this was in coverage by the ''Daily Express'' newspaper, which referred to the discovery as a woman, but only to use it to mock the [[Suffragette]] movement of the time, of which the ''Express'' was highly critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goulden | first1 = M.| title = Bringing Bones to Life: How Science Made Piltdown Man Human

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5763">The '''Polytechnics Central Admissions System''' ('''PCAS''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|iː|k|ɑː|s}}) was an administrative body handling admissions in England and Wales to most courses at [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnics]] and some other [[higher education]] institutions for the entry years 1986 to 1992. It ran in parallel to the university admissions system, [[Universities Central Council on Admissions|UCCA]], as well as the [[Central Register and Clearing House]], which dealt with teacher-training applications to both polytechnics and specialist teacher training colleges, and [[Art and Design Admissions Registry|ADAR]] which originally handled art and design course admissions to both polytechnics and specialist art and design colleges. All these admissions systems are now united within the [[UCAS]] admissions system.

==History==

The establishment of the teacher training admission system, the Central Register and Clearing House, in 1933, and the central admissions system for British universities, called UCCA, in 1961 had shown the benefits of a single admission system for higher education applicants. Although the polytechnics were degree-teaching institutions, through the [[CNAA]] awards system, they were not eligible for admission to UCCA as it was reserved only for universities with degree awarding powers. Despite this the Polytechnics (see [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)]] were involved as early as 1972 in discussions with [[Universities Central Council on Admissions|UCCA]] and the [[Central Register and Clearing House]] about the possible future shape of one or more admissions systems.&lt;ref name=RKU&gt;Kay, Ronald "UCCA: Its Origins and Development 1950=85", UCCA, 1985, pp.83-89&lt;/ref&gt;  At this stage applicants dealt directly with each polytechnic and the polytechnics themselves were strongly regional or local in their appeal. A study in 1977 found that between sixty and seventy per cent of those admitted to a polytechnic had applied to that institution only, and that forty per cent of admissions to polytechnics resulted from applications made in August or September of the year of entry.&lt;ref name=RKU/&gt;

In 1983 the Committee of Directors of Polytechnics began negotiations with UCCA to share its computing, technical and office facilities in [[Cheltenham]] to establish a course entrance system, based on the existing model used by UCCA.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Segal, 'A rationalised confusion' in ''The Guardian'' (UK Newspaper) 31 January 1984, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; A grant of £210,000, from the British [[Department for Education and Science]], was awarded to set up a new unified admissions system, provisionally called PUCCA.&lt;ref&gt;John Fairhall, 'Admissions streamlining plan for polytechnics' in ''The Guardian'' (UK Newspaper) 12 January 1984, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; However, instead of a unified system for both the universities and polytechnics a separate system for polytechnics emerged from the negotiations, modelled on UCCA, but known as PCAS. 
The PCAS name was chosen as the [[Department for Education and Science]] grant was conditional upon the new scheme being made available for applications to Colleges of Higher Education later on. It was thought that the PCAS acronym could remain if the organization's name needed to be changed to Polytechnics' &amp; Colleges' Admissions Service.

Applicants to courses were given the option to apply separately for universities or polytechnics, or for both.

The PCAS system came into effect in 1985.&lt;ref name="Polytechnic Central Admissions System 1985, p.11"&gt;'Introducing the new Polytechnic Central Admissions System' in ''The Guardian'' (UK Newspaper) 11 June 1985, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; It was led by its first Chief Executive, Tony Higgins,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;'Sector pays tribute to Higgins, champion of access' in The Times Higher Education Supplement (UK newspaper) 23 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and in the first year it handled around 140,000 applications to polytechnic courses, of whom 40,000 a year went on to study at polytechnics.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Fennell, 'Horizons: Don't blot your copy book - The odds are moving back in favour of the applicant for higher education' in ''The Times'' (UK Newspaper) 21 September 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many polytechnics offered art and design programmes, and some also offered teacher training courses, these admissions systems remained outside PCAS.&lt;ref name="Polytechnic Central Admissions System 1985, p.11"/&gt;

==Merger with University Admissions System==

Although the aim to create a unified application system for universities and polytechnics was not achieved in 1985, the Chief Executive of PCAS, Tony Higgins, continued to push for the merger of PCAS with UCCA.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 1992, following the change of status and name of most polytechnics to universities,&lt;ref&gt;Donald MacLeod, 'Poly genesis: Have the new universities lost their ray since they emerged from the old olytechnics ?', in ''The Guardian'' (UK Newspaper) 3 September 2002, Section B, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; the two bodied did combine under Higgins's leadership.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Initially the application form was branded jointly UCCA/PCAS,&lt;ref&gt;'The new joint UCCA/PCAS application form' in ''The Guardian'' (UK Newspaper) 10 September 1991, Section B, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1994 the new merged body was renamed [[UCAS]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Croall, 'Nightmare Scenario' in ''The Guardian'' (UK Newspaper) 19 August 1993, Section B, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1238">In [[political science]], a '''principle-policy puzzle''' is a disconnect between support for a principle and support for a policy supporting that principle.  

The primary example is the apparent inconsistency between American support of the principle of [[racial equality]], and lack of support of a policy intended to achieve racial equality, especially among those most politically aware.  The seeming [[paradox]] is explained by noting that lack of support for [[affirmative action]] comes from conservative [[ideology]], such that opponents of government policies intended to realize racial equality are not necessarily hypocrites. Individuals may also agree with the principle but feel that the policies do not actually help to achieve the stated principle.

A more global example is the strong international desire for a clean and health environment compared to the lack of enthusiasm for the type of regulations and taxes that would be needed to achieve this.

==References==

The principle-policy puzzle was described in ''Reasoning and Choice'' (1991) by Paul M. Sniderman, Richard A. Brody, and Philip E. Tetlock.

The '''Regional Forum on Environment and Health in Southeast and East Asian Countries''' is a global framework for action provided by Agenda 21 of the 1992 [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]]; the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development; the [[Millennium Development Goals]] of the [[United Nations]] and the recommendations of the fifth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development in Asia and the Pacific (held at [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] in March 2005) on enhancing the environmental sustainability of economic growth. The second Ministerial Regional Forum was held 14–16 July 2010 in [[Jeju Province]], South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/66mK9MDsR?url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/12/117_69551.html  Bae Ji-sook, "Ministers tackle environmental damage".

=={{anchor|Points}}Charter==
*Recognizing that the environment greatly affects health,
*Acknowledging the importance of ensuring the protection of human health and the environment,
*Understanding that children, the elderly and the poor are among the most vulnerable to and suffer most from environmental deterioration,
*Conscious that improving environmental health and ensuring sustainable economic growth are key components of poverty reduction,
*Realizing that the maintenance of health and well-being depend on environmental quality and sustainable development,
*Underlining the importance and cost-effectiveness of giving priority to preventive action,
*Conscious of the urgency to take immediate, coordinated action involving all relevant government agencies, organizations from the private sector, civil society, academia and media,
*Aware that solutions require inter-disciplinary and cross-sectoral interventions with experts from physical and natural sciences, health and social sciences, development, finance and other fields,
*Realizing the specific characteristics, cultural diversity and needs of the region (its unprecedented economic development, rapid urbanization and population growth and widespread poverty),
*Admitting that nations in the region are physically interconnected by shared bodies of water and air,
*Mindful that many environmental and health issues are trans-boundary in nature and that globalization has highlighted the interdependence of nations, communities and individuals,
*Keeping in mind existing international agreements on the protection of the ozone layer, climate change, biodiversity conservation, the management of chemicals and wastes and other initiatives related to environment and health,
*Mindful of the precautionary approach and guided by the "polluter pays" principle and the norms of good governance including civic engagement and participation, efficiency, equity, transparency and accountability,
*Taking note of the various efforts being undertaken by various countries at the national and regional levels,

The ministers responsible for the environment and health of the Southeast Asian countries of [[Brunei]], [[Cambodia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos|Lao People’s Democratic Republic]], [[Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam|Viet Nam]], and the East Asian countries of [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Mongolia]] and the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], meeting together for the first time at Bangkok on 9 August 2007, adopted the charter of the Regional Forum on Environment and Health; have agreed upon the principles, vision, goals and objectives, strategies and structures set forth therein as the basis for their joint commitment to collective and individual country actions, and call upon their international partners to support the implementation of the charter.

==Sustainable development==
[[Sustainable development]] encompasses nurturing the environment, enhancing economic growth and social equity to reduce poverty, promoting the health and well-being of people and encouraging partnerships and cooperation among stakeholders and countries in the region.
Without environmental and health protection, development is undermined. Without economic growth (essential to poverty reduction and improving the quality of life), protection of the environment and promotion of health will also fail.
The Regional Forum's vision is to safeguard and enhance health and the environment, promoting development which reduces poverty.
The interplay of health and environment and their role in poverty reduction needs to be understood and addressed.
This can be achieved by a national approach that integrates the efforts of stakeholders in preserving the environment with the protection of human health and well-being. The regional forum also believes that national efforts for environmental preservation and health protection may be affected by development activities and environmental and health conditions in neighboring countries. Thus, greater regional partnership and cooperation are needed to address common interests and threats to the region.

==Goals and objectives==
The general objective of the regional initiative is to effectively deal with the environmental-health problems within countries and among themselves by increasing the capacity of Southeast and East Asian countries in environmental-health management.
It aims to strengthen the cooperation of the ministries responsible for environment and health within the countries and across the region by providing a mechanism for sharing knowledge and experiences, improving policy and regulatory frameworks at the national and regional level, and promoting the implementation of integrated environmental-health strategies and regulations.

==Initiatives==
*Effectively and efficiently achieve their targets in health, environmental sustainability, poverty and global partnership for development under the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG)
*Institutionalize the integrated management of environmental health at all levels within each participating country and among the Southeast and East Asian countries through the establishment of a coordinated institutional mechanism
*Enable countries to assess priority environmental health risks, develop and implement cost-effective national environmental health action plans (NEHAP) and disseminate them to stakeholders

=={{anchor|THE WAY FORWARD}}Future plans==
The member countries of the Regional Forum on Environment and Health in Southeast and East Asian Countries should:
* Undertake the best possible actions available to address (and reverse) the trend of environmental degradation and its negative impact on health to ensure the implementation of global and regional agreements (such as the Millennium Development Goals)
* Establish and/or strengthen existing inter-agency and multi-sector technical working groups and national coordination mechanisms and processes, linking these with other countries in the region to facilitate capacity-building and the exchange of information, technology, resources and learning
* Prepare and regularly update NEHAP (or equivalent plans) and ensure their implementation so priority environmental-health issues in each country are effectively addressed
* Build the capacity of stakeholders so they can be mobilized to support the implementation of NEHAP
* Strengthen collaboration among themselves and with other regional and global intergovernmental bodies on trans-boundary, regional, and global environmental-health issues (including attendance at the regional forum
* Advocate for adequate budgets and resources for the environment and health sectors in their countries
* Ensure that the charter is widely disseminated within each country and across the region in the languages of the region

International partner organizations are encouraged to:
* Support this regional initiative by providing needed technical and financial assistance and sharing information and expertise
* Support the development and implementation of NEHAP and equivalent plans
* Intensify coordination and cooperation among themselves to optimize the use of resources
* Ensure proper coordination with existing intergovernmental processes

Countries and partner organizations should work for the widest possible endorsement of the charter, to ensure the attainment of its objectives.
Ministers responsible for environment and health of southeast and east-Asian countries will meet every three years to assess national and regional progress and agree on specific actions to reduce significant environmental threats to health.

'''Stratovision''' was an airborne television transmission [[relay system]] from aircraft flying at high altitudes. In 1945 the Glenn L. Martin Co. and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] advocated television coverage of small towns and rural areas as well as the large metropolitan centers by fourteen aircraft that would provide coverage for approximately 78% of the people in the [[United States]]. This system has been used for domestic broadcasting in the United States, and used by the U.S. military in [[South Vietnam]] and other countries.

==Technology==
Because the broadcasting antenna for Stratovision is usually hung beneath the aircraft in flight, it naturally has a great command of [[Line-of-sight propagation]]. Although transmission distances are dependent upon atmospheric conditions, a transmitting antenna {{convert|30,000|ft|km}} above the Earth's surface has a line of sight distance of approximately {{convert|211|miles|km|abbr=on|0}}.

A Stratovision 25&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter operating from {{convert|30,000|ft|km}} at 600&amp;nbsp;MHz will achieve a [[field intensity]] of 2 millivolts per meter for a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} high receiving antenna up to {{convert|238|mi|km}} away from the aircraft.

==Early tests==
Stratovision tests were undertaken between June 1948 to February 1949. The first phase was undertaken by the Glenn L. Martin Co. and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] using a twin-engine [[Lockheed Ventura|PV-2 aircraft]] flying at {{convert|25,000|ft|km}} that transmitted with 250 watts on 107.5&amp;nbsp;MHz and 5&amp;nbsp;kW on 514&amp;nbsp;MHz at [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] so that recordings could be made at various locations ranging from [[Norfolk, Virginia]] to [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].

The second phase of testing was undertaken by these companies using a stripped-down '''[[B-29 Superfortress]]''' flying at {{convert|30,000|ft|km}}. The plane was equipped to receive a relay transmission from [[WMAR-TV]] in Baltimore, which was then relayed over a 5&amp;nbsp;kW video transmitter and a 1&amp;nbsp;kW audio transmitter for reception on 82-88&amp;nbsp;MHz with a television set tuned to Channel 6.

The aircraft received its originating signals from circular dipoles attached to a streamlined eight-foot (2.5&amp;nbsp;m) mast on top of the aircraft's vertical tail fin. The retractable {{convert|28|ft|m}} long broadcasting antenna hung vertically beneath the aircraft. It was composed of a two-element turnstile array for video and a single-element circular dipole for sound transmissions.

The receivers, transmitters and necessary air-conditioning were all powered by the plane's engines using three 15&amp;nbsp;kVA, 500&amp;nbsp;Hz alternators. Without air conditioning the transmitters in the interior of the aircraft would have generated a temperature of 134 degrees Fahrenheit (57 degrees Celsius) with an outside air temperature of 25 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 4 degrees Celsius).

On 23 June 1948 the system's airborne transmitter rebroadcast the [[Republican National Convention]], being held in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], to the surrounding nine-state area during the 9 to 10 pm [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|EDT]] time period. As part of the activity, a receiver was set up in a hall in [[Zanesville, Ohio]], a small city on the outskirts of the broadcast area (to demonstrate to the invited newspaper reporters that the system was capable of reaching "small town and farm homes").&lt;ref&gt;[[Air &amp; Space]] magazine, Vol 22 No 3, August 2007, "Broadcast Bomber", p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The tests were watched by many television viewers who sent in reception reports. From these reports it was calculated that Stratovision would require only eight relay planes to provide a transcontinental network and six additional planes to provide coverage to 78 percent of the United States. Mr. Charles Edward Nobles who was the head of Stratovision for Westinghouse said in his report:
:"''The major technical problems of the system have been solved, and the commercial development awaits only the crystallization of public demand for the expanded services offered by airborne broadcasting, application of the system by the radio industry to meet this demand, and the clarification of channel facilities available to make possible this application.''"

==Education by Stratovision==
In 1961 a nonprofit organization, [[Midwest Program on Airborne Television Instruction]], commenced a Stratovision service from the [[Purdue University Airport|airfield of Purdue University]]. The effort began as a three-year experiment funded by the [[Ford Foundation]]. The program organized, produced and transmitted educational television programs four days a week from a [[Douglas DC-6|DC-6AB]] aircraft flying at {{convert|23,000|ft|m}} over the community of Montpelier in north central Indiana.

MPATI delivered its programs to television channels 72 (call sign KS2XGA) and 76 (KS2XGD) in the UHF band, by transmitting videotaped lectures from the aircraft to an estimated potential 5,000,000 students in 13,000 schools and colleges. The aircraft were equipped with two {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on}} videotape machines and two UHF transmitters.

When MPATI signed on it used an [[Indian Head test card|"Indian head" test pattern card]] which was shown for five minutes before and between programs. The service ended in 1968 when it became embroiled in legal action over their application of Stratovision in a controversy with the Westinghouse company.

==Propaganda by Stratovision==
===Vietnam War===
During the Vietnam War, the [[United States Navy]] also used Stratovision television technology when it flew ''Operation Blue Eagle'' from 1966 to 1972 over the [[Saigon]] area of [[South Vietnam]]. The television programs were aimed at two audiences on two channels. One was aimed at the general public and the other was intended for the information and entertainment of US troops who were stationed in South Vietnam.

On January 3, 1966, ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable|Broadcasting magazine]]'' reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Vietnam to get airborne TV'''&lt;br&gt;
'''Two-channel service - one for Vietnamese, other for U.S. servicemen - starts this month'''&lt;/center&gt;
''Television broadcasting in South Vietnam ... begins January 21 and it's going to be done from the air. Two airplanes, circling {{convert|10,000|to|20,000|ft|km|abbr=off|disp=sqbr}} above the ground, will broadcast on two TV channels&amp;mdash;one transmitting Saigon government programs; the other U.S. programs. The project is being handled by the [[U.S. Navy]]. Also involved are the [[U.S. Information Agency]] and the [[Agency for International Development]]. Work on modifying two [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Super Constellation]]s has been underway by Navy electronics experts at [[Andrews Air Force Base]] ... The project is an outgrowth of a broadcasting plane used by the Navy during the [[Cuba]]n and [[Dominican Republic]] crises when both radio and television were beamed to home in those countries.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same article went on to report that during the Baseball [[World Series]] of October 1965 Stratovision had also been used to bring the games to the troops. The aircraft had picked up [[Voice of America]] radio broadcasts from [[California]] and relayed the signal to a ground broadcasting station. The Agency for International Development (AID) had purchased through the military [[Post Exchange Service]], 1,000 monochrome, 23-inch television sets modified to operate on a variety of domestic power sources, and which had been airlifted to South Vietnam on December 28, 1965. They were to be put into community facilities around Saigon. AID was also spending $2.4 million to supply a total of 2,500 TV sets to South Vietnam.

The entire project was under the control of Captain George C. Dixon, USN. He claimed to be installing AM, FM, shortwave and TV transmitters on the aircraft which would get their power from an onboard 100&amp;nbsp;kW diesel-fueled generator. The planes would not only relay programs from [[film chain]] [[kinescope]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and video recorders, but they would also have live cameras to create their own live programs.

Ground transmissions would be received from the aircraft on TV sets tuned to channel 11 for Armed Forces Television, and channel 9 for programs in Vietnamese. On radio the broadcasts would be tuned to 1000&amp;nbsp;kHz for AM and 99.9&amp;nbsp;MHz for FM.

On 7 February 1966, Broadcasting magazine reported that after working out a number of technical problems that the first show on channel 9 would begin at 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and feature South Vietnamese Prime Minister [[Nguyen Cao Ky]] and U.S. Ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge|Cabot Lodge]] in a videotaped production, followed by channel 11 at 8&amp;nbsp;p.m. with [[William Westmoreland|General Westmoreland]] introducing a two-hour program which incorporated one hour of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] filmed in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. After that the Vietnamese channel would be seen for one and half hours a day and the U.S. channel for three hours daily.

On 8 February 1966 [[The New York Times]] reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''South Vietnamese Watch First TV Show'''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The story reported that the South Vietnamese viewers had to strain their ears because the speakers on the TV sets would need to be amplified if they were going to be heard by a room full of people watching '''THVN-TV''' channel 9. The U.S. programming on '''NWB-TV''' channel 11 was [[Bob Hope]] in a two-hour special called ''Hollywood Salute to Vietnam'', followed by half-an-hour of the ''Grand Ole Opry'' and another half-hour of the quiz show ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''. The regular line-up of shows included [[Bonanza]], ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]], [[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.

===1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia===
[[EC-130 Commando Solo]] was used in propaganda warfare during [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] with questionable success. Production was very cheap, below local TV standards in [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] with slide show and narration based news. Quality of reception was very poor and area of coverage was rather small.

===Iraq War===
During the 2000s, the [[EC-130 Commando Solo]] has been used to broadcast information and propaganda for the United States over a variety of television and radio frequencies. It has been used in several areas of operation, including [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Iraq]].

==Pirate television by Stratovision==
In 1969 news stories{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} began to appear in the [[United Kingdom]] that [[Ronan O'Rahilly]], the founder of the [[pirate radio]] ship based service called [[Radio Caroline]], which at that time was not on the air, was about to launch [[Caroline Television]] instead. His plans called for two aircraft, one in service and one as a relief, which would transmit commercial television programs to [[UK|Britain]] by Stratovision. Although these stories continued for some time nothing became of the project. To date no pirate radio or television service has ever operated by means of Stratovision.

==Stratovision: a temporary service==
Today the Stratovision concept is used as a stop-gap measure where land based transmitters are not possible and where large areas of territory need to be served with a television program. Due to the advent of [[fibre optic]] [[cable television]] systems and [[direct broadcast satellite]] services, Stratovision has become unnecessary as a permanent means of television delivery.

==Popular culture==
* The [[1987 in film|1987 film]] ''[[The American Way (film)|Riders of the Storm]]'' (also known as ''The American Way'') used a similar concept, with a group of Vietnam Veterans running a [[pirate television]] station (S&amp;M TV) from a [[B-29]] that was constantly in flight.&lt;ref&gt;''The American Way'' [www.imdb.com/title/tt0091853/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1] accessed 2014-12-13&lt;/ref&gt;
* A similar system, using helicopters, is mentioned in the 1950 [[Robert A. Heinlein]] story ''[[The Man Who Sold the Moon]]''.

'''Student Transportation Inc.''', [[doing business as]] '''Student Transportation of America''' (STA) and '''Student Transportation of Canada''' (STC), is a [[New Jersey]]-based [[school bus contractor]] that focuses on [[rural]] and [[suburb]]an areas. It is the third-largest school bus transportation services provider in [[North America]], with over 11,500 vehicles that transport students in more than 225 [[school district]]s.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

== History ==
Student Transportation of America was founded in 1997 by Denis J. Gallagher, who is the chairman and CEO of the company.&lt;ref name=about /&gt; With roots that can be traced to New Jersey’s Coast Cities Bus Service established in 1922 by Gallagher’s grandfather, STA successfully completed an [[initial public offering]] and its income participating securities (IPS) began trading on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] in December 2004.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.ridesta.com/about.cfm|publisher=Student Transportation Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, the company changed its name from Student Transportation of America, Ltd., to Student Transportation Inc.  It continues to use the trade names Student Transportation of America and Student Transportation of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investor.shareholder.com/stbun/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=425814 Shareholders Approve Corporate Name Change to Student Transportation Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Student Transportation has grown considerably through its "A‑B‑C-D" ([[Mergers and acquisitions|Acquisition]], Bid, Conversion, and Direct-to-Parent) growth strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industry Overview|url=http://www.ridesta.com/industry.cfm|publisher=Student Transportation Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Top 50 Contractors |work=School Bus Fleet |page=37 |date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolbusfleetdirectory.com/Student-Transportation-of-America-cp238142.htm |title=Student Transportation of America &amp;#124; School Bus Fleet Online Directory |publisher=Schoolbusfleetdirectory.com |accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among STA's customers is the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]], which is the second largest school district in the United States.

In 2018, Student Transportation was privatized by its majority shareholder, [[Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stnonline.com/news/latest-news/item/9279-school-bus-contractor-sti-to-be-acquired-by-investment-groups|title=Investment Groups to Acquire School Bus Contractor STI|last=Gray|first=Ryan|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was formerly publicly traded on both the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] and [[Nasdaq]].

'''Ticio Escobar''' is a [[Paraguay]]an lawyer, academic, author, museum director, and former Minister of Culture of Paraguay.&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt; He has championed the rights of [[Indigenous peoples of Paraguay]], writing about and curating shows on the topic.

== Early life and education ==
Escobar was born on February 9, 1947, in [[Asunción]]. His father was jurist Jorge H. Escobar, and his mother is María Rosalba Argaña Ferraro.&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt; He graduated in Law at the [[Universidad Católica Nuestra Señora de la Asunción]] in 1970. Five years later, in 1974, he obtained his [[Master's degree]] (''licencia'') here in [[Philosophy]]. During his study, he was a member of the Comisión de Defensa de los Derechos Humanos en el Paraguay, a [[human rights]] group.&lt;ref name="docPCF"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://www.princeclausfund.nl/urbanheroes/escobar/TICIO.doc biography] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UH-PCF"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://www.princeclausfund.nl/urbanheroes/escobar/eng/index.htm ''Urban Heroes'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Between 1971 and 1989, Escobar was a university professor in the fields of [[philosophy of law]], [[mathematical logic]], [[philosophical anthropology]], [[history of art]] and [[art criticism]].&lt;ref name="AQE"&gt;A Quienes Elegimos, [http://www.aquieneselegimos.org.py/dat/679-cv1-1(ul).doc Curriculum Vitae] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1980, he was an art reviewer for the Museo Paraguayo de Arte Contemporáneo. In 1979 he founded the [[Museo del Barro]] (museum of pottery) in Asunción, with the objective to preserve Paraguayan culture. The same year he also founded the Museo de Arte Indígena, Centro de Artes Visuales (museum for indigenous art, center of visual art). To this museum, of which he was also the director until 2008, he donated his own art collection.&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt;&lt;ref name="UH-PCF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AQE" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://www.princeclausfund.org/en/network/user/id/344 profile]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts and activism==
Between 1978 and 1988, Escobar was the curator for Paraguay at the Biennale of [[São Paulo]]. Furthermore, he was curator for several versions of the [[Venice Biennale]] and the biennales of [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Lima]] and [[Porto Alegre]], and for a number of expositions in [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]]. At the beginning of the 1990s, he joined two movements for [[Indigenous peoples' rights]]: the Asociación Indigenista del Paraguay and the Asociación Apoyo a las Comunidades Indígenas del Paraguay (ACIP).&lt;ref name="docPCF" /&gt;

From 1991-1996 he was Director of Culture of the city of Asunción.&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt; In 1996 he won a national contest to edit a bill on culture, which was later adopted by parliament as ''Ley Escobar 3051/06''. From 2008-2013 he was the Minister of Culture of the government of [[Fernando Lugo]].&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt;&lt;ref name="docPCF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UH-PCF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBA"&gt;Circulo de Bellas Artes, [http://www.circulobellasartes.com/ficha.php?s=fich_bio&amp;id=653 biography] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Habana Radio (11 February 2011) [http://www.habanaradio.cu/singlefile_news/?id_not=20110211163053 ''Ticio Escobar, el crítico devenido Ministro''] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130412053822/http://www.habanaradio.cu/singlefile_news/?id_not=20110211163053 |date=2013-04-12 }} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Transport Tycoon''''' is a [[video game]] designed and programmed by [[Chris Sawyer]], and published by [[MicroProse]] in 1994. It is a [[business simulation game]], presented in an [[isometric projection|isometric]] view in 2D with graphics by Simon Foster, in which the player acts as an entrepreneur in control of a transport company, and can compete against rival companies to make as much [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] as possible by transporting passengers and various goods by road, rail, sea and air.

'''''Transport Tycoon Deluxe''''' is an expanded and improved version of the original game, released in 1995. A version for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] was released on 3 October 2013 using assets from the sequel, ''[[Chris Sawyer's Locomotion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-10-03-transport-tycoon-out-now-on-ios-and-android |title=Transport Tycoon out now on iOS and Android |last=Whitehead |first=Dan |date=3 October 2013 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=3 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233008/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-10-03-transport-tycoon-out-now-on-ios-and-android |archivedate=4 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[fan-made]] [[game engine recreation]] ''[[OpenTTD]]'' is also available.&lt;ref name="RPS1"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
To start building a transport empire, the player must construct transport routes, consisting of stations near industries or towns, and in the case of trains or road vehicles, near physical routes. One transport route can utilize several different forms of transport, e.g. truck→ship→train. The player's company and the individual stations each have ratings that depend largely on their efficiency at moving goods from one stations to the other. A station with high ratings may attract more goods.

The game begins in 1930, and ends in 2030. The player starts out by borrowing money to finance construction of transport facilities, and is charged interest until the loan is repaid.  As the user plays the game and earns revenues, they have the choice of expanding service along existing routes, or expanding their transportation network.  The game features a progression of technology: in any particular year of the game generally only contemporary types of technology are available.  For example, [[railroad signal]]s which allow more than one train to use a section of track are initially [[Railway semaphore signal|semaphores]]. Later, they are replaced by red and green traffic-light signals. Similarly, in the beginning there are only [[Steam locomotive|steam engines]], but later [[Diesel locomotive|diesel]] and [[Electric locomotive|electric]] engines are introduced.  In the game year 1999, monorails become available.  These require a separate track system from railroads.  If the player remains in business until 2030, the game announces that they have won, allows them to post their name on the "hall of fame" and then continues.  At this point, the year stays 2030 and never goes any higher, although the game can continue indefinitely.  Playing the entire 100-year campaign takes about 40 hours. The game allows the player to save at any time, and multiple saves of a particular game at any point are possible.

Vehicles in the game must be constructed at corresponding depots, which must be connected to the road or rail networks. Towns and cities have their own road networks, but extra roads may be needed to connect them to other towns, or to various resources.

[[File:OpenTTD industry-commodity flow chart - Temperate.svg|thumb|300px|Chart illustrating flow of commodities between industries and towns in ''Transport Tycoon'', and Temperate scenarios in ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe''.]]

The player earns revenue by picking up resources or passengers at a certain station, and delivering them to another station where there is a demand for them.  Demand is determined by the area which surrounds the station; for example stations close to towns will demand passengers.  The revenues will depend on the delivery time, distance, and quantity delivered.  The influence of these factors on revenue varies according to the type of goods being delivered. For example, mail will rapidly fall in value, meaning that it can only be delivered profitably over short distances, or over long distances very fast.  On the other hand, coal loses value very slowly, so it can be transported in bulk over long distances whilst remaining profitable.

At times, subsidies are offered to the first company to move a particular resource from one place to another. This encourages the player to create a larger more complex transport network, rather than focusing on previously profitable routes.

The game features a system of Local Authority. Each city has a rating for every transport company based on the impact of their transport network.  When the rating falls too low, the player will no longer be able to demolish buildings or construct new stations. The rating depends on, among others, the level of service and the [[deforestation]] caused by the company.

In the course of a game cities develop and expand according to various economic factors, and new industries (demand) or other resource sites (supply) may appear.  Some natural resources may also eventually be exhausted and industries without adequate transport service may shut down. Also, new models of vehicles are introduced and eventually come to replace older models.  At introduction such a new model will likely have improved characteristics, but may suffer from reliability issues.

== Music ==
The music in ''Transport Tycoon'' are original compositions by [[John Broomhall]]. It features old-style blues and jazz tunes including parts of [[Herbie Hancock|Herbie Hancock's]] [[Cantaloupe Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chrissawyer.com/faq2.htm |title=Is the music used in Transport Tycoon available as MIDI files? |last=Sawyer |first=Chris |accessdate=6 September 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825134432/http://www.chrissawyer.com/faq2.htm |archivedate=25 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' gave the DOS version four out of five stars, commenting, "The best economic sim since ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'', Microprose's new ''Transport Tycoon'' has all the features of [[Sid Meier]]'s ''[[Railroad Tycoon]]'' mixed with the look and ease of [[Maxis]]' ''[[SimCity 2000]]'' and a host of new features ... that give the game a feel that is all its own." He further lauded the game for its graphics, "pleasant" music, sound effects, addictive play, and realistic simulation of the growth of cities and towns.&lt;ref name="NG4"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Transport Tycoon |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=4|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=April 1995|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the ''Transport Tycoon Scenario'', rating it three stars out of five, and stated that "A solid upgrade for a great game."&lt;ref name="NG6"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=6|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=June 1995|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related titles==
A "World Editor" expansion pack was also released for the original ''Transport Tycoon'', but was overshadowed by the Deluxe version released shortly afterward. It featured an alternative, Martian set of graphics, which did ''not'' appear in TTD.

===''Transport Tycoon Deluxe''===
''Transport Tycoon Deluxe'' is an expanded and improved version of the original game.

The primary difference between the games is how [[Railway signal|signals]] operate. The original ''Transport Tycoon'' allows only ''bi-directional signals'', which allow trains to pass in either direction. The deluxe version introduced ''uni-directional signals'', that only allow a train to pass in a single direction. The change in gameplay from this alteration to signals is significant, as the old bi-directional signals would allow a train to travel in both directions. This is similar in concept to having a single lane street that would allow traffic from either end. Unsurprisingly, it was possible for two trains to try to travel in opposing directions towards each other on the same run of track. While this would not result in crashes on a properly signaled route, it required either the building of extra track to allow the trains to pass each other, or the building of a great many tracks in parallel to avoid the problem in the first place.

The new uni-directional signals allowed one-way tracks to be built, which gives the player much greater control over how the railway network could be run. This allowed for efficient routes to be built, and prevented trains from trying to travel the "wrong way" down a section of track. By incorporating both uni-directional and bi-directional signals, effective switching yards, [[Junction (rail)|junctions]], and other useful designs could be built. It also unlocked the ability to build continental-length railroad systems by incorporating one-way rails in both directions and the ability to merge other rails with the main one. This is a highly used strategy because it allows for intercontinental transport of goods which results in high return rates for the player.

The deluxe version also expanded the game to provide tropical, Arctic, and toy-town environments, as well as the classic temperate environment. The new environments came with different industries and challenges. For example, towns in the Arctic environment would not grow without regular deliveries of food, and those in the tropical environment also need access to fresh water. The main game runs over the course of a century, from 1950 to 2050.

Due to [[trademark]] issues with using names of real vehicles in the original ''Transport Tycoon'', the default names were replaced with fictional ones in ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe''. Players however are allowed to rename their vehicles and stations as they please, which can be useful for identifying individual services in a network.  Players are also able to rename towns, which provides for a more personalized game play.

=== ''Chris Sawyer's Locomotion'' ===
{{main|Chris Sawyer's Locomotion}}
After the success of ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe'', [[Chris Sawyer]] turned his attention towards a sequel, but during development he changed his mind and produced ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon (video game)|RollerCoaster Tycoon]]'', which turned out to be a runaway hit.  After ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 2]]'' was done, work on the third version was left to another development team, and Sawyer returned to work on a ''Transport Tycoon'' sequel, ''[[Chris Sawyer's Locomotion]]''. It was released in September 2004 and was described by Sawyer as the "spiritual successor to ''Transport Tycoon''".

It received poor reviews and was deemed a commercial failure on release, but sales through the digital rereleases are unknown. Regardless, there is an active ''Locomotion'' community that continues to produce modifications.

===iOS and Android version===
On 15 July 2013, Sawyer's 31X Ltd and Origin8 Technologies announced that they were working on a mobile version of Transport Tycoon. Sawyer was originally focusing on funding for the game but ended up overseeing the design and helped with the debugging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/196526/Chris_Sawyer_on_his_reentry_back_into_video_games.php Chris Sawyer on his reentry back into video games] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722112830/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/196526/Chris_Sawyer_on_his_reentry_back_into_video_games.php |date=22 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released for iOS and Android on 3 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toucharcade.com/2013/09/19/transport-tycoon-releasing-on-ios-and-android-october-3rd/ 'Transport Tycoon' Releasing on iOS and Android October 3rd] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005020329/http://toucharcade.com/2013/09/19/transport-tycoon-releasing-on-ios-and-android-october-3rd/ |date=5 October 2013 }} by Jared Nelson (013-09-19)&lt;/ref&gt; The game is single player and uses graphics from ''[[Chris Sawyer's Locomotion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/management-geeks-rejoice-as-transport-tycoon-arrives-on-ios/ |title=Transport Tycoon Review: Infrastructure Has Never Been So Fun |last=Brookes |first=Tim |date=14 October 2013 |work=[[MakeUseOf]] |accessdate=24 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209084812/http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/management-geeks-rejoice-as-transport-tycoon-arrives-on-ios/ |archivedate=9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third-party creations ===
[[File:Openttd transport tycoon-terabass.jpg|thumb|250px|OpenTTD network game across 4 monitors]]
Several development teams are currently working to improve ''Transport Tycoon''. ''TTDPatch'' provides gameplay enhancements and numerous bugfixes to ''TTD'' by patching the original binary.

''[[OpenTTD]]'' is an [[Free and open-source software|open source]] complete [[Game engine recreation|recreation]] of ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe'', achieved by [[reverse engineering]] the original game.&lt;ref name="RPS1"&gt;[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/10/31/the-50-best-free-games-on-pc/44/ The 50 Best Free Games On PC - 8.

While both games allow new graphic sets for vehicles and terrain to be used, at present, ''TTDPatch'' still requires the original ''TTD'' graphics, sounds, binary and music files to run. While ''OpenTTD'' can still use the original ''TTD'' graphics and sounds, it does not need any of the ''TTD'' files to run as it has [[Free content|free graphics and sounds]].&lt;ref name="RPS1"/&gt;

The '''Virginia Literacy Foundation''' (VLF), is an organization whose mission is to reduce adult illiteracy in Virginia by providing funding and technical support to private, volunteer adult literacy organizations that teach low level literacy adults to read and write with one-on-one instruction and tutoring.  The VLF was founded by [[Jeannie Baliles]], Virginia's First Lady from 1986 to 1990, and founding director [[Mark Emblidge]], and was incorporated as a [[501(c)(3)]] organization in 1987. The VLF supports [[grass roots]] organizations via challenge grants, direct consultation, and program development training with public partners like The Virginia Adult Learning Resource Center. The VLF also works in partnership with public institutions, corporations, and private literacy organizations in Virginia to address adult illiteracy in the workplace and to provide family literacy training to teachers and parents. The VLF is governed by the founding Executive Director, Mark E. Emblidge, and a Board of Directors chaired by Jeannie Baliles.

==Reducing Illiteracy in Virginia==

===Adults===
Despite a 25-year effort by the VLF and the organizations it supports to teach literacy skills to adults, Virginia still has 853,786 adults who never completed high school (2006 US Census American Community Survey). One out of five adults is considered functionally illiterate, and 662,715 lack basic prose literacy skills. These adults learn to read and write best through the customized one-on-one tutoring provided by the private community-based literacy organizations that the VLF supports through grants and training. The VLF's mission also supports developing workforce skills, at first through the Workforce Improvement Network in partnership with [[James Madison University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Virginia Literacy Foundation|url=http://www.virginialiteracy.org/about/index.php|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with PluggedIn Virginia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plugged In|url=http://www.pluggedinva.com/history.php|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  through its partnership with The Literacy Institute at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Literacy Institute: Plugged In|url=http://www.theliteracyinstitute.org/projects/pluggedin.php|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, 34.1% of job applicants lacked the literacy skills needed to do the job they sought. Functionally illiterate adults have a profound impact on Virginia’s economy. Regions where adult illiteracy rates soar above 25-30% are unable to attract and retain businesses.

==In support of Virginia's adult literacy organizations==

===Grant giving===
Since it was established, the Foundation has funded grass roots literacy programs that have helped 200,000 adult Virginians learn to read. When the VLF was started, the organization supported 34 community- and faith-based literacy organizations across Virginia who served a total of 1,400 adults. In 2008, the number of adult students served per year by VLF supported organizations has jumped to 14,000 adult learners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virginialiteracy.org/about/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; The VLF has disbursed over $3.4 million in challenge grants since 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Virginia Literacy Foundation|url=http://www.virginialiteracy.org/about/index.php|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to fund data collections systems, program expansion and improvement, operating costs, staff salaries, and the purchase of equipment and supplies. The VLF has collaborated with important public/private partners such as the Virginia Department of Education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baliles|first=Jeannie|title=First Mondays|url=http://doetest.vi.virginia.gov/instruction/adulted/newsletter/2010/first_mondays_040510v1n1.pdf|accessdate=September 5, 2011|date=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the Verizon Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tiki, Ronde Barber Named Verizon Literacy Champions for Virginia|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Tiki,+Ronde+Barber+Named+Verizon+Literacy+Champions+for+Virginia%3B...-a0104004008|newspaper=Newswire|date=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who have consistently awarded funds to help the VLF achieve its mission.

===Training and Workshops===
In addition to the grants, the VLF provides technical support and advice  and direct assistance with tutor training, board development, and [[strategic planning]] through its public partner, the Virginia Adult Learning Resource Center (VALRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virginia Adult Learning Resource Center|url=http://www.valrc.org/about/ourpartners.html|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a yearly grant budget of $200,000, the VLF funds from 26-32 non-profit adult literacy organizations per year. In order to qualify for VLF funds and workshops through the VALRC, these organizations must serve a minimum of 30 clients per year within their communities, follow promising practices in non-profit management, and demonstrate a willingness to strengthen and improve their programs through active collaborations and partnerships with community groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virginialiteracy.org/about/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annual Conference===
Each year, the VLF has sponsored an annual 2-day conference for all literacy programs in Virginia, including those that are too small to qualify for VLF grants. This conference, held in Richmond, provides workshops in program management, tutor training, EL/Civics, and learning disabilities and basic literacy teaching techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The VLLC|url=http://vllc.wordpress.com/vllc-conference/|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public/private partnerships==
The VLF's public/private partnerships have increased the organization's ability to address illiteracy in Virginia. While the VLF's mission primarily addressed the adult learner, the organization recognizes that the parent is the child's first teacher and that illiteracy must be addressed across an individual's lifespan from pre-K to adulthood. By partnering with other agencies with similar missions, the VLF has been able to work with a larger number of individuals through partner programs and their staff.

===The Virginia Literacy Initiative===
The initiative, which brought the public and private sectors together, was one of the first public-private partnerships of its kind in the nation. Founded in 1987 by the VLF and the Virginia Council for Adult Education and Literacy, the partnership increased the number of Virginians participating in literacy instruction from 24,309 in 1987 to over 55,000 in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;The Virginia Literacy Foundation: 1995 Report to Virginians, p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Virginia Adult Learning Resource Center===
The VLF also partnered with the Centers for Professional Development (now the [http://www.valrc.org/ Virginia Adult Learning Resource Center] (VALRC) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.valrc.org/&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] and the Virginia Office of Adult Education at the [[Virginia Department of Education]] to establish the Literacy Training Office. Training consisted of free professional development and program development workshops and technical assistance training for private volunteer groups. In 2000, four literacy support coordinators representing four regions in Virginia, offered regional technical advice and support to over eighty non-profit literacy organizations through the Literacy Support Center, a unique collaborative public/private project that helped to strengthen literacy programs through training and mentoring. These four positions were consolidated into one, and today a literacy specialist, who works with both the VLF and the VALRC, ensures that training and technical services for nonprofit organizations are coordinated.

===Regional Literacy Coordinating Committees===
The VLF, along with the Office of Adult Education at the Virginia Department of Education, was also instrumental in organizing and facilitating cooperation among the many private and public adult literacy agencies and social services through fourteen Regional Literacy Coordinating Committees, which still serve the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REgional Literacy Coordinating Committee|url=http://rlcc12.blogspot.com/|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Literacy Institute===
In 2002, the VLF partnered with Virginia Commonwealth University’s School of Education and Center for Public Policy to form [http://www.theliteracyinstitute.org/ The Literacy Institute]. The Institute ensures that Virginia’s public policy makers are kept aware of the problem of illiteracy in the Commonwealth and to directly combat that problem through research and development projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theliteracyinstitute.org/ The Literacy Institute: Official site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promoting literacy across the lifespan==
In the early 1990s, the VLF received a [http://www.toyota.com/about/philanthropy/diversity/family-literacy.html Toyota Family Literacy Grant], which allowed the organization to partner with Richmond Public Schools, Richmond Public Libraries, the Department of Social Services  and other public entities in order to provide family literacy services for at-risk families. Since that time, the VLF has actively promoted family literacy, encouraging literacy programs to teach parents the literacy skills they need to obtain jobs or seek promotions and help their children with school work. Through its partnership with The Literacy Institute, the VLF has benefited from the expertise gained from three [http://www.ed.uab.edu/erf/index.htm Early Reading First grants] that totaled $12 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.vcu.edu/news/VCU_Awarded_44_Million_to_Promote_Early_Literacy&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with the Robins Foundation and Richmond Public Schools, the VLF founded NoRF, now named Excell, a project that addressed the literacy needs of at-risk pre-K children who live in Richmond's north side.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kidsreadytolearn.org/&lt;/ref&gt; This research-based program has continued and expanded in Richmond, and is now named Excell.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soe.vcu.edu/aboutus/pdf/tli.docx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.connectrichmond.org/portals/1/POST%20Survey%20Report%20-%20FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virginialiteracy.org/projects/excell.php&lt;/ref&gt;
