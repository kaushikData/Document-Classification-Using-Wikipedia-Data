      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11891">'''The Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards''' ('''AIHTS''') establishes the required standards for approval and certification of [[animal trapping]] devices.

== History ==
In 1991, following extensive pressure from the anti-fur lobby, the [[European Union]] (EU) passed Regulation 3254/91, which bans the import of wild fur products derived from 13 species into the EU from any country, unless the use of the [[leghold trap]] is prohibited in said country, or trapping methods used in that country meet internationally agreed humane trapping standards. EU Regulation 3254/91 remains in place in the EU today .&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991R3254:EN:HTML |title=Council Regulation (EEC) No 3254/91 |accessdate=2009-03-10}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Following several years of negotiations, the EU agreed to two humane trapping agreements in 1997. The Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards (AIHTS) was reached with the EU, Canada and Russia;
&lt;ref name="two"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/PH0782.htm |title=Council Decision 98/142/EC |accessdate=2009-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213194356/http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/PH0782.htm |archivedate=2012-02-13 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; a separate agreement was reached between the EU and United States due to US regulatory requirements.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/PH2306.htm |title=Council Decision 98/487/EC |accessdate=2009-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213194400/http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/PH2306.htm |archivedate=2012-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Agreements incorporate the same standards. The EU Council ratified them in 1998.
&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; All countries are encouraged to apply the AIHTS.
&lt;ref name="four"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/wcc_res_rec_eng.pdf |title=Humane Trapping Standards, 2004 World Conservation Congress, Resolutions and Recommendations |accessdate=2009-03-10}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Under these agreements, all [[animal trapping|traps]] must be tested against the standards set out in the AIHTS and, if they conform, must be certified by a designated competent authority. If they fail to meet the Standards, they must be replaced with traps that do.
&lt;ref name="five"&gt;
{{Cite journal |title=Text: AGREEMENT on International Humane Trapping Standards between the European Community, Canada and the Russian Federation |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status of the AIHTS ==
The AIHTS was signed by [[Canada]] and the EU in December 1997 and by the [[Russian Federation]] in April 1998.  A separate [[bilateral agreement]] with equivalent standards was signed between the US and Europe in 1998.  Both agreements are legally binding on all signatories.
  
The [[Russian parliament]] ratified the AIHTS for implementation on July 22, 2008. The [[European Parliament]], as of 2008, has yet to approve a [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] to implement the Agreement within its member countries. Canada has been implementing the AIHTS on a bilateral basis (with the EU), in good faith, since the Canadian government ratified it in 1999. The USA has been progressing on implementing its best management practices under its bilateral EU agreement.

==Main points of the Agreement==
Under the AIHTS, the parties (currently, Canada, EU and Russia) guarantee not to impose [[trade restrictions]] on [[fur]] products from listed species from other signatory countries. The Agreement establishes procedures for settling disagreements and does not affect the right to resort to [[WTO]] (World Trade Organization). The Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards applies to listed species (total of 19) regardless of the reason for trapping, including: 
*[[Wildlife management]] purposes, including pest control
*Obtaining fur, skin, or meat
*The capture of [[mammals]] for [[conservation biology|conservation]]
The AIHTS establishes criteria for rating traps by species and by method of use. [[Killing traps]] are rated according to the time to [[loss of consciousness]]. Restraining traps are rated according to injuries indicative of poor welfare.  Ratings form part of the trap approval process.

The AIHTS establishes approval and [[certification]] standards for all types of traps and requires that traps be certified as meeting the AIHTS, initially by fall 2007. The Agreement prohibits the use of restraining and killing traps that are not certified in accordance with the Standards. However, it does not prevent individuals from constructing and using traps that comply with designs approved by the competent authorities. (Competent authorities are legal bodies that regulate trapping, including governments, government mandated agencies and those [[Indigenous peoples|Aboriginal]] groups with authority to regulate wildlife management activities.) Traps not meeting the Agreement Standards must be phased out by the [[signatories]]. If there are no traps certified for a particular [[species]], all traps legal for use for that species can continue to be used until certified traps become available and provided research continues to search for traps that meet the Agreement Standards.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

== Other points in the AIHTS ==
Under the Agreement, parties are instructed to use their best efforts to ensure appropriate processes are in place for permitting the use of traps and for enforcing trap [[legislation]] within their [[jurisdiction]]. It is also recommended that parties have in place trapper training in [[humane]] devices/methods. The Agreement also advocates incorporating ISO testing procedures into the trap certification process.
&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

Parties of the AIHTS (Canada, Russian Federation and EU) are required to meet on an ongoing basis. Delegates to these meetings make up the Joint Management Committee (JMC), established under the terms of the AIHTS to administer the Agreement.  The US is a permanent observer on the JMC.

== Objectives of the Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards ==
#To meet a requirement of EU Regulation 3254/91
#To pursue an international standard that scientifically addresses animal welfare related to trapping furbearers. This reduces the ability to force legislation based on political lobbying efforts
#To enlist signatories to address the issue of animal welfare related to trapping, regardless of the reason the animals are trapped. Whether it is for pest control, research, disease control, wildlife management or the commercial fur trade, the AIHTS is designed to ensure that the same scientifically validated standards apply in all three jurisdictions.
#To maintain access to the European wild fur market. As the world's fashion centre, the European Union remains an important market for North American wild fur

As the Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards is a dynamic treaty, it provides opportunity for continuing the improvement of animal welfare related to trapping as new technology and scientific knowledge emerges
&lt;ref name="six"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Species covered by the AIHTS ==
In EU Regulation 3254/91, 12 North America and one Russian furbearer species were listed. 
Under the AIHTS, six additional European species were added.
The Standards apply to the following 19 species:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
|+ Species List
!width="200"|Original 13 !!width="200"|European Species Added
|-
|[[Badger]] || Badger
|-
|[[Beaver]] || Beaver
|-
|[[Bobcat]] || [[Lynx]]
|-
|[[Coyote]] || [[Pine marten]]
|-
|[[Ermine]] || [[Raccoon dog]]
|-
|[[Marten]]
|-
|[[Muskrat]]
|-
|[[Otter]]
|-
|[[Raccoon]]
|-
|[[Wolf]]
|-
|[[Sable]] (''Russian'')
|}

Additional species, regardless of the reason for trapping them, may be included in the future as appropriate. All signatory parties must agree to any changes made to the species list.

== Traps covered by the AIHTS ==
AIHTS requirements for certification in accordance with the Standards do not apply to traps individually constructed by trappers.

=== Killing Traps ===
Definition: Traps designed and set with the intention of killing a trapped animal of the target species. May include restraining traps set as killing traps when used in water.

=== Restraining Traps ===
Definition: Traps designed and set to restrain a target animal's movements. For use on land only. This includes all traps such as the foot snare, the padded foothold trap and any other limb restraining traps that are not "conventional steel-jawed leghold restraining traps". It also applies to manufactured live capture cages and boxes.

== Implementation requirements and progress ==
Since autumn 2007, only certified traps are legally permitted for trapping the species listed in the Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards.  Local or regional jurisdictions may have additional regulatory requirements exceeding the AIHTS.
Restraining Traps - The use, on land, of conventional steel-jaw leghold restraining traps for the following species is now prohibited:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
|width="100"|Badger ||width="100"|Lynx
|-
|Beaver || Marten
|-
|Bobcat || Muskrat
|-
|Coyote || Otter
|-
|Ermine || Raccoon
|-
|Fisher || Wolf 
|}

Other restraining traps, such as laminated, padded, offset, foot [[snare trap|snares]] and [[cage (enclosure)|cage]] traps must meet the requirements of the AIHTS and be certified initially by 2007.  If research has not identified certifiable traps for use on a particular species by 2007, the AIHTS has a provision for continued use of current traps while research continues.  Research is ongoing among all four countries.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Trap Certification – The certification process for both restraining and killing traps began in 2002. Criteria for certification are: 
*performance under AIHTS requirements
*safety and efficiency (as required by a competent authority)
*manufacturer must put certification mark on traps and provide instructions for use
As required under the Agreement, six provisional Joint Management Committee meetings have been held to date, in Edmonton, Alberta (2000), Brussels, Belgium (2002), St. Petersburg, Russia (2003), New York City, USA (2004), Quebec City, Canada (2005) and Brussels, Belgium(2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12145">[[File:Amasya-eski.jpg|thumbnail|The town of Amasya, in the interior of the [[Black Sea]] coast, where the trials and the executions took place.]]
The '''Amasya trials''' in 1921, were special ad hoc trials, organized by the [[Turkish National Movement]], with the purpose to kill en masse the Greek representatives of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] region under a legal pretext.&lt;ref name=Hofmann208/&gt; They occurred in [[Amasya]], modern [[Turkey]], during the final stage of the Pontic [[Greek genocide]].&lt;ref name=Hofmann208/&gt; The total number of the executed individuals is estimated to be ca. 400-450, among them 155 prominent [[Pontic Greeks]].&lt;ref name=Vergeti77/&gt;

==Background==
{{Main article|Greek genocide}}
{{Greek Genocide}}
The Ottoman genocide policy against the [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic Greek]] populations was initiated after the outbreak of [[World War I]] (1914), mostly through deportation and forced death marches. This policy of extermination was intensified, after accusations that the Pontic Greek communities supported the Russian army. As a result, the Ottoman authorities deported thousands of local Greeks to the interior of [[Anatolia]]. The Ottoman genocide policy took a more violent form in 1917, when [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] entered World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, 2013: p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of the deported populations died from disease, exhaustion and epidemics during death marches. Those who managed to survive the marches were either raped, subject to forced islamization or murdered. Meanwhile, Turkish irregular band (cete) leaders, like [[Topal Osman]], notorious from his role in the [[Armenian Genocide]], were dispatched against the Greeks of [[Samsun]] province in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Gerlach, 2010: p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

The same policy continued after the outbreak of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]], where groups of irregular Turkish bands acted with the support of the [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish nationalists]] of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] and committed massacres in the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] region in 1920-1921.&lt;ref&gt;Suny, Goçek, Müge, Naimark, Norman, 2011: p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==
The Turkish nationalists' aim was to conduct summarily trials and executions of the Pontic Greek elite. Thus they would be able to exterminate the main representatives of the Greek community of the Black Sea coastal area under a legal pretext, as part of the still active genocide policy.&lt;ref name=Hofmann208&gt;Hofmann, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; These "[[Independence Tribunals (Turkey)|Independence tribunals]]" were conducted in [[Amasya]], a town in the interior of Anatolia, far from any foreign consulate, in order to avoid the presence of western representatives, since this was considered an "inner case".&lt;ref name=Hofmann208/&gt;

From December 1920 the Turkish nationalists started to arrest en masse various Greek representatives from all parts of the Pontus region and imprisoned them in Amasya.&lt;ref name=Hofmann208/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kyriakidis/&gt; The trials begun in the end of August 1921, however, no concrete evidence was ever found to link the accused with anti-Turkish activity.&lt;ref&gt;Koutsoupias, 2000: p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; There were only abstract claims that some of them supported the Russian army during World War I.&lt;ref name=Koutsoupias408/&gt; In the same fashion, the Turkish nationalists felt offended when they realised after investigation that the jerseys of the local Greek soccer team ''Pontus Metzifon'' displayed the colors of the Greek flag (blue and white).&lt;ref name=ethnos&gt;{{cite web|last1=Telidis|first1=Hristos|title=Οι Πόντιοι που Mάτωσαν τη Φανέλα του Ελληνισμού|url=http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22768&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=63829903|publisher=ethnos.gr|accessdate=1 July 2014|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trials were presided by Emin Bey Gevecioğlu, solicitor from nearby [[Samsun]].&lt;ref name=Kyriakidis&gt;Tsirkinides, 1999: p. 192: "...sentenced to death 177 Greeks who were executed. Included among them was [[Euthymios (Agritellis) of Zela|Zelon Euthemios]], assistant bishop of Amassea, who died in prison from typhus, ...he ordered even the dead to be hanged with the others. Also sentenced to death in absentia were 44 Greeks..."&lt;/ref&gt; After summary proceedings, where insults and berating comments were shouted at the accused persons by the judge, the verdict for the vast majority of them was death, with the pretext that they organized the independence of Pontus. The sentences were handed down immediately.&lt;ref name=Koutsoupias408&gt;Koutsoupias, 2000: p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;

From August 20 to September 21, 1921, 177 Greeks of the Pontus region were hanged as a result of these proceedings.&lt;ref name=Kyriakidis/&gt; The exact total number of those executed by the Amasya trials is unknown, while estimations vary from 400 to 450 persons. On 25 September 1921, a local Turkish newspaper, published a list of 155 prominent Pontic Greeks who were hanged in the central square of Amasya.&lt;ref name=Vergeti77/&gt;

Those sentenced to death were politicians, businessmen, journalists and religious figures of the local Greek community. Among them was the local assistant bishop of Amasya, [[Euthymios (Agritellis) of Zela|Euthemios Zelon]], who died in prison from typhus. Nevertheless, the court sentenced him to death posthumously and his dead body was hanged in the central square of the town together with the others.&lt;ref name=Kyriakidis/&gt;

==Aftermath and reactions==
[[File:Pontus Greek Soccer Team.JPG|thumbnail|A number of the soccer players of "Pontus Merzifon" (pictured) were sentenced and hanged, without concrete evidence of anti-Turkish activity: Turkish nationalists felt offended because the team's jersey displayed the colours of the Greek flag (blue-white).&lt;ref name=ethnos/&gt;]]
The trials and the executions in Amasya by the Turkish movement of [[Mustafa Kemal]] succeeded in the extermination of the Pontic Greek elite under a legal pretext,&lt;ref name=Hofmann208/&gt; while the total death toll of the Pontic Greek community, as a result of the Ottoman and Turkish policies, from 1915 to 1923, is estimated from 353,000 to 360,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=BetGivargis-McDaniel|first1=Maegan|title=Assyrians of New Britain|date=2007|publisher=Arcadia Pub.|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=9780738550121|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2XctSfgPTEC&amp;pg=PA7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalayjian|first1=Ani|last2=editors|first2=Dominique Eugene,|title=Mass trauma and emotional healing around the world : rituals and practices for resilience and meaning-making|date=2010|publisher=Praeger|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9780313375408|page=311|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=v7G1U_vZCYaq0QXGt4EI&amp;hl=el&amp;id=jXxWAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=pontian+353000&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22From+1915+to+1923%2C+over+353%2C000+Pontian+Greeks+were+murdered.+Mustafa+Kemal+%281881-1938%29+was+behind+the+modernization+and+industrialization+of+the+Republic+of+Turkey+as+well+as+its+militarization.%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Merrill D.|title="Starving Armenians" : America and the Armenian Genocide, 1915-1930 and after|date=2004|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville (Va.)|isbn=9780813922676|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mh_kbQjMfgsC&amp;pg=PA124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vergeti, 1993: p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, 2007: p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions for the atrocities committed occurred both inside and outside Turkey. The hanging of [[Matthaios Kofidis]] in Amasya, former member of the Ottoman parliament, who opposed any form of armed resistance movement against the Turkish authorities, caused anger even among the Muslim population of [[Trabzon|Trebizond]], who refused to collaborate with the Turkish nationalists, thus saving the lives of several local Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, 2006: p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests were reported in Greece and the United Kingdom. Moreover, countries which had been at that time in alliance with the Turkish nationalists, like France and Italy, also condemned the atrocities.&lt;ref name=Hofmann210/&gt; The issue of the extermination of the Pontic Greek population was also raised in the [[United States Congress]] in December 22, 1921 by senator [[William H. King]].&lt;ref name=Hofmann210&gt;Hofmann, 2007: p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Castillo v. Case Farms of Ohio''''',  96 F Supp. 2d 578, is a case involving poor working conditions for migratory workers.  It established that an [[Agency (law)|principal / agent]] relationship existed between Case Farms and America's Tempcorps (ATC) that allowed Case Farms to be liable for its agent's actions.

==Facts==
[[Migrant workers|Migrant farm workers]] were recruited in Texas by America's Tempcorps to work in Case Farm's [[Ohio]]-based chicken processing plant.  They were given a bus ticket and $20 for three days of food. Upon arriving they found themselves living in conditions called "distressing and deplorable" by the court.  The employees were packed in to unfurnished rooms infested with cockroaches and rats.  The workers slept on the floor and were transported in an overcrowded van.

==Issue==
The working conditions were largely not refuted.  At issue was 1) whether or not American's Tempcorps (ATC) was an agent of Case Farms, and 2) if agency existed, whether that agency make Case Farms liable for ATC’s actions.

==Complaint==
The plaintiffs alleged:
*Violations of the [[Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Protection Act]] (AWPA)
*Violations of the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]]
*[[Breach of Contract]]
*[[Fraud]]
*[[Negligence|Negligent]] Misrepresentation

==Plaintiff’s Argument==  
Castillo argued that agency relationship existed between ATC and Case Farms, and the scope of that relationship included both the [[Agency (law)|express authority]] to recruit and hire people to work at Case Farms’ plant, and the [[Agency (law)|implied authority]] to do all things proper, usual and necessary to exercise that authority.

==Defendant’s Argument==  
Case Farms argued, to the extent that an agency relationship existed, the scope of that agency was limited solely to informing recruits about the availability of work at Case Farms’ processing plant.  They also contended that the workers recruited by ATC were not full-fledged Case Farms workers (despite the fact that the work, pay rates, and supervision of these workers were essentially identical to Case Farms employees.)

== The Court's Analysis ==   
1) A principal may be liable for the acts of a purported agent based on an actual agency relationship created by the principal’s express or implied delegation of authority to the agent.

2) A principal is liable only if those actions are taken in the scope of the agent’s employment.
Express actual authority exists “where the principal has made it clear to the agent that he wants the act under scrutiny to be done.”

3) Giving an agent express authority to undertake a certain act also includes the implied authority to do all things proper, usual, and necessary to exercise that express authority.

The evidence at trial supported the contention that Case Farms expressly authorized ATC to recruit and hire people to work at Case Farms’ Ohio plant, and that such an express agency existed with the scope of recruiting and hiring migrant workers.
The evidence also supported the contention that the housing and transportation activities were well within the agents implied authority—based on Case Farms’ unique recruiting challenges, the great distances the migrant workers sought were required to travel, and Case Farms outsourcing of this difficult recruiting task to ATC.

== Holding ==   
America's Tempcorps was an agent of Case Farms, ATC’s actions were attributable to Case Farms for the purpose of assessing compliance with the [[Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act|AWPA]], and Case Farms was liable for ATC’s actions..

'''''Jane Doe v. Trump''''' (1:17-cv-01597-CKK) is a lawsuit filed on August 28, 2017 in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]].

The lawsuit was amended to add one more anonymous plaintiff and two named plaintiffs in late August 2017. In addition to President Trump, the amended suit names as defendants the Secretaries of [[United States Department of Defense|Defense]] ([[James Mattis]]), the [[United States Army|Army]] ([[Ryan McCarthy (U.S. Army)|Ryan McCarthy]], acting), the [[United States Navy|Navy]] ([[Richard V. Spencer|Richard Spencer]]), the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] ([[Heather Wilson]]), and [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] ([[Kirstjen Nielsen]]).&lt;ref name=17-cv-1597-170831 /&gt;

==Background==
Trump first announced a policy banning transgender people from serving in the military in "any capacity" in a series of tweets on July 26, 2017, stating that allowing such service members would incur "tremendous medical costs and disruption". The decision reversed [[Obama administration]] policy to allow the enlistment of transgender personnel, which was initially approved by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to begin July 1, but was delayed by Defense Secretary Mattis.&lt;ref name=reinstatement&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40729996 |title=Trump: Transgender people 'can't serve' in US military |author= |date=26 July 2017 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pilotonline.com/news/military/local/trump-s-transgender-military-ban-sparks-outrage-applause-from-hampton/article_fa33b881-656e-549e-a14c-212fba4b272d.html |title=Trump's transgender military ban sparks outrage, applause from Hampton Roads |author1=Mabeus, Courtney |author2=Hafner, Katherine |author3=Sidersky, Robyn |date=26 July 2017 |newspaper=The Virginian-Pilot |accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump issued formal guidance on the ban to the Secretaries of Defense and [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] in [[Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security|a memorandum]] on August 25, 2017.&lt;ref name="wh-25aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/25/presidential-memorandum-secretary-defense-and-secretary-homeland|accessdate=August 28, 2017|publisher=[[The White House]]|date=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On August 31, 2017, three former secretaries of military services, [[Eric Fanning]] (Army), [[Ray Mabus]] (Navy), and [[Deborah Lee James]] (Air Force), submitted declarations in support of the plaintiffs,&lt;ref name="nbc-31aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Pete|last2=Nichols|first2=Hans|last3=Sotomayor|first3=Marianna|title=Former Military Service Secretaries Join Lawsuit Opposing Trump Transgender Ban|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/former-military-service-secretaries-join-lawsuit-opposing-transgender-ban-n797851|accessdate=September 2, 2017|newspaper=NBC News|date=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three plaintiffs were added to the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=17-cv-1597-170831&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.glad.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/AS-FILED-Public-Complaint-17cv1597.pdf |title=''Jane Doe, et. al. v.

On October 4, the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Division]] filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in ''Jane Doe v. Trump'' and to oppose the application for a preliminary injunction, arguing instead "that challenge is premature several times over" and that Secretary Mattis's Interim Guidance, issued on September 14, 2017, protects currently-serving transgender personnel from involuntary discharge or denial of reenlistment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4067310/Doe-v-Trump-Defendants-Motion-to-Dismiss.pdf |title=''Jane Doe, et. al. v.

In the brief, the states asserted that "[n]othing about being transgender inhibits a person’s ability to serve in the military or otherwise contribute to society" and that President Trump's ban was "apparently announced without any consultation with top military leaders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nclrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/15StateAttorneysGeneralDvT-2.pdf |title=''Jane Doe, et. al. v.

===Preliminary injunction granted===
{{quote |text=The Court holds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their Fifth Amendment claim. As a form of government action that classifies people based on their gender identity, and disfavors a class of historically persecuted and politically powerless individuals, the President’s directives are subject to a fairly searching form of scrutiny. Plaintiffs claim that the President’s directives cannot survive such scrutiny because they are not genuinely based on legitimate concerns regarding military effectiveness or budget constraints, but are instead driven by a desire to express disapproval of transgender people generally. The Court finds that a number of factors—including the sheer breadth of the exclusion ordered by the directives, the unusual circumstances surrounding the President’s announcement of them, the fact that the reasons given for them do not appear to be supported by any facts, and the recent rejection of those reasons by the military itself—strongly suggest that Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claim is meritorious. |author=Judge [[Colleen Kollar-Kotelly]] |source=Memorandum Opinion, ''Jane Doe v. Trump'' (October 30, 2017).&lt;ref name=MemoOpinion /&gt;}}

Judge [[Colleen Kollar-Kotelly]] granted the plaintiffs' preliminary injunction on October 30, 2017.&lt;ref name=NYT-171030&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/military-transgender-ban.html |title=Judge Blocks Trump's Ban on Transgender troops in Military |author=Philipps, Dave |date=30 October 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ruling, Judge Kollar-Kotelly noted the defendants' motion to dismiss the case was "perhaps compelling in the abstract, [but] wither away under scrutiny." The ruling effectively reinstated the policies established prior to President Trump's tweets announcing the ban, namely the retention and accession policies for transgender personnel that were effective on June 30, 2017. However, the court denied a preliminary injunction against the ban on government-funded [[sex reassignment surgery]] for service members "because no Plaintiff has demonstrated that they are substantially likely to be impacted by this directive."&lt;ref name=MemoOpinion&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2017cv1597-61 |title=''Jane Doe, et. al. v.

In the order, Judge Kollar-Kotelly clarified the Order of October 30 effectively reverted the policy back to the ''status quo'' that existed prior to the Presidential Memorandum of August 25, meaning that accession of transgender individuals will proceed as scheduled starting January 1, 2018, per Secretary Mattis's modification issued June 30, 2017 to DTM 16-005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/28/16709494/judge-trump-transgender-military-ban-recruits |title=Federal judge: military must allow transgender recruits starting on January 1 |author=Lopez, German |date=28 November 2017 |work=Vox |accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=17-cv-01597-doc70&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nclrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Clarification-Order.pdf |title=''Jane Doe, et. al. v.

{{quote |text=Although they hint in their most recent pleading that a new policy proposal is forthcoming in the next few weeks, Defendants fail to provide the Court with any insight at all into what the policy might be. The Court is left to speculate. On the one hand, to the extent the policy Defendants foresee adopting in the future is a ''ban'' on accessions—which the Court has already concluded is likely to be proven unconstitutional—this is clearly not a reason to stay the injunction in this case. On the other hand, as the Court has already explained, there is no reason to conclude on the present record that Defendants intend to implement any sort of policy ''allowing'' for the accession of transgender individuals. Defendants have never given the Court any reason to conclude that this would be the case. |author=Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly |source=''Order'' of December 11, 2017&lt;ref name=17-cv-01597-doc75 /&gt;{{rp|5–6}}}}

On December 11, Judge Kollar-Kotelly denied the motion for partial stay, noting it took three weeks for USDOJ to file the first appeal, and that she "would have expected Defendants to act with more alacrity" if the January 1, 2018 deadline for accession was unmanageable.&lt;ref name=17-cv-01597-doc75&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.eqcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/75-Order-Denying-Partial-Stay.pdf |title=''Jane Doe, et. al. v.

===Emergency stay===
USDOJ filed for an emergency stay with the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia|D.C. Circuit]] late on December 11,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/11/politics/us-pentagon-transgender-enlist/index.html |title=DOJ appeals ruling that transgender people are free to enlist in US military |author1=Crawford, Jamie |author2=de Vogue, Ariane |date=11 December 2017 |work=CNN |accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling the accession of transgender individuals "a significant change to its standards for the composition of the armed forces" and asking that either Secretary Mattis be allowed to further defer the start of accessions, or ruling the scope of the preliminary injunction and clarifying order should narrowly apply only to the identified Plaintiffs.&lt;ref name=17-cv-5267-doc1708433&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/trump-trans-military-dc-appeal.pdf |title=''Jane Doe, et. al. v.

In addition, an ''amici'' brief was filed by retired military officers and national security officials supporting the injunction on December 15. The brief compared the accession of transgender candidates with prior changes to accession policy, including the racial and sexual integrations that occurred during the Truman and Obama Administrations, concluding that "Each of the above personnel decisions was the product of a rigorous policy review involving senior military officials and an evidence-based examination of the likely impact of the proposed change. In sharp contrast, on the morning of July
26, 2017, President Trump suddenly announced a ban on transgender persons serving in the military in a series of three tweets. No effort was made—nor evidence presented—to show that this pronouncement resulted from any analysis of the cost or disruption allegedly caused by allowing transgender individuals to serve openly in the military."&lt;ref name=17-cv-5267-docX&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.glad.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Motion-and-Amicus-Brief-Retired-Military-and-Former-National-Security-Doe-v-Trump-12-15-final.pdf |title=''Jane Doe, et. al. v.

On December 22, 2017, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit denied the request for an emergency stay. In the order, the judges wrote that USDOJ had failed to identify "the scope of Secretary Mattis's asserted authority to act in this matter entirely independently of the specific directions of the commander in Chief", concluding that USDOJ had failed "to make a compelling case on the current record that any of the stay factors weigh in their favor".&lt;ref name=17-cv-5267-doc1710359&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nclrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DoeStayDenied-2.pdf |title=''Jane Doe, et. al. v.

===Discovery and protective orders===
In December 2017, the Plaintiffs served a discovery request aimed at identifying when and on what basis President Trump decided to ban military service by transgender persons.&lt;ref name=17-cv-01597-doc86-2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.eqcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/86-Defense-Letter-re-Discovery.pdf |title=''Jane Doe, et. al. v.

USDOJ formally filed a motion for a protective order on February 27, 2018, complaining about the "multiple, burdensome discovery requests [issued] directly to the President of the United States" and noting the responsiveness in issuing "more than 80,000 pages of documents on an expedited, rolling basis from the Department of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Defense Health Agency, and the Departments of the Army, Air Force, and Navy".&lt;ref name=17-cv-01597-doc89&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.eqcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/89-D-Mtn-Protective-Order.pdf |title=''Jane Doe, et. al. v.

On March 2, USDOJ followed up with a second motion to remove the President as a defendant and dissolve the injunction with respect to the President, arguing the "Plaintiffs may not obtain—and the Court may not order—injunctive or declaratory relief directly against the President for his official conduct" but conceding "in cases involving the President and other defendants, courts avoid granting relief against the President and instead grant relief only against subordinate officials in the Executive Branch.&lt;ref name=17-cv-01597-doc90&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.eqcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/90-D-Mtn-Judgment-on-Pleadings-and-Dissolve-PI-in-part.pdf |title=''Jane Doe, et. al. v.

The '''Equal Treatment Directive''' [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32006L0054 2006/54/EC] is an Act of the [[European Union]], which implements the principle of [[equal treatment]] between men and women in [[EU labour law]].

==Background==
Since the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] came into force in 1999, new EU laws, or [[EU Directive|Directives]], have been enacted in the area of anti-discrimination. The Equal Treatment Directive 2006/54/EC is a consolidation of previous Directives in this area, notably, the [[Directive 76/207/EEC]], which was amended by [[Directive 2002/73/EC]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20315">'''Fire-safe polymers''' are [[polymers]] that are resistant to [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] at high temperatures. There is need for fire-resistant polymers in the construction of small, enclosed spaces such as skyscrapers, boats, and airplane cabins.&lt;ref name=zhang&gt;Zhang, H. ''Fire-Safe Polymers and Polymer Composites,'' Federal Aviation Administration technical report; U.S. Department of Transportation: Washington, D.C., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In these tight spaces, ability to escape in the event of a [[fire]] is compromised, increasing [[fire]] risk. In fact, some studies report that about 20% of victims of airplane crashes are killed not by the crash itself but by ensuing [[fires]].&lt;ref name=sarkos&gt;Sarkos, C. P. The Effect of Cabin Materials on Aircraft Postcrash Fire Survivability. ''Technical Papers of the Annual Technical Conference'' '''1996,''' ''54'' (3), 3068-3071.&lt;/ref&gt; Fire-safe [[polymers]] also find application as [[adhesives]] in aerospace materials,&lt;ref name=kumar&gt;Kumar, D.; Gupta, A. D.; Khullar, M. Heat-resistant thermosetting polymers based on a novel tetrakisaminophenoxycyclotriphosphazene. ''J. Polym. Sci. Part A: Polym. Chem.'' '''1993,''' ''31'' (11), 2739-2745.

Some fire-safe [[polymers]] naturally exhibit an intrinsic resistance to [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]], while others are synthesized by incorporating fire-resistant additives and fillers. Current research in developing fire-safe [[polymers]] is focused on modifying various properties of the [[polymers]] such as ease of [[flammability|ignition]], rate of heat release, and the evolution of smoke and toxic gases.&lt;ref name="zhang" /&gt; Standard methods for testing [[polymer]] [[flammability]] vary among countries; in the United States common fire tests include the UL 94 small-flame test, the ASTM E 84 [[Steiner tunnel test|Steiner Tunnel]], and the ASTM E 622 [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) smoke chamber.&lt;ref name="zhang" /&gt; Research on developing fire-safe [[polymers]] with more desirable properties is concentrated at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] and at the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] where a long-term research program on developing fire-safe [[polymers]] was begun in 1995. The Center for UMass/Industry Research on Polymers (CUMIRP) was established in 1980 in Amherst, MA as a concentrated cluster of scientists from both academia and industry for the purpose of [[polymer]] science and engineering research.&lt;ref name="zhang" /&gt;

Controlling the [[flammability]] of different materials has been a subject of interest since 450 B.C. when [[Egyptians]] attempted to reduce the [[flammability]] of wood by soaking it in [[potassium aluminum sulfate]] ([[alum]]). Between 450 B.C. and the early 20th century, other materials used to reduce the flammability of different materials included mixtures of [[alum]] and [[vinegar]]; [[clay]] and [[hair]]; [[clay]] and [[gypsum]]; [[alum]], [[ferrous sulfate]], and [[gypsum]]; and [[ammonium chloride]], [[ammonium phosphate]], [[borax]], and various [[acids]]. These early attempts found application in reducing the flammability of wood for military materials, theater curtains, and other textiles, for example. Important milestones during this early work include the first [[patent]] for a mixture for controlling flammability issued to Obadiah Wyld in 1735,&lt;ref name="hindersinn" /&gt; and the first scientific exploration of controlling flammability, which was undertaken by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] in 1821.&lt;ref name="hindersinn" /&gt;

=== Developments since WWII ===
Research on fire-retardant [[polymers]] was bolstered by the need for new types of [[synthetic polymers]] in [[World War II]]. The combination of a [[halogenated]] [[Alkane|paraffin]] and [[antimony trioxide|antimony oxide]] was found to be successful as a [[fire retardant]] for canvas tenting. Synthesis of [[polymers]], such as [[polyesters]], with [[fire retardant]] monomers were also developed around this time.&lt;ref name=robitschek&gt;Robitschek, P.; Bean, C. T. Flame-Resistant Polyesters from Hexachlorocyclopentadiene. ''Ind. Eng. Chem.'' '''1954,''' ''46'' (8), 1628-1632. [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ie50536a034 ] {{doi|10.1021/ie50536a034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating flame-resistant additives into [[polymers]] became a common and relatively cheap way to reduce the flammability of [[polymers]],&lt;ref name=connolly&gt;Connolly, W. J.; Thornton, A. M. Aluminum Hydrate Filler in Polyester Systems. ''Mod. Plastics'' '''1965,''' ''43'' (2), 154-202.&lt;/ref&gt; while synthesizing intrinsically fire-resistant [[polymers]] has remained a more expensive alternative, although the properties of these [[polymers]] are usually more efficient at deterring [[combustion]].&lt;ref name="hindersinn" /&gt;

== Polymer combustion ==

=== General mechanistic scheme ===
Traditional [[polymer]]s [[Chemical decomposition|decompose]] under heat and produce combustible products; thus, they are able to originate and easily propagate [[fire]] (as shown in Figure 1).

[[Image:disfig1.svg|frame|694x452px|center|Figure 1: A general scheme of [[polymer]] [[combustion]].]]
The [[combustion]] process begins when heating a [[polymer]] yields [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] products. If these products are sufficiently concentrated, within the [[flammability limits]], and at a temperature above the ignition temperature, then [[combustion]] proceeds. As long as the heat supplied to the [[polymer]] remains sufficient to sustain its [[thermal decomposition]] at a rate exceeding that required to feed the flame, [[combustion]] will continue.&lt;ref name=camino &gt;Camino, G.; Costa, L.; Luda di Cortemiglia, M. P. Overview of Fire Retardant Mechanisms. ''Polym. Degrad. Stabil.'' '''1991,''' ''33'' (2), 131-154. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TXS-48HY9B8-99&amp;_user=7379334&amp;_coverDate=12%2F31%2F1991&amp;_rdoc=2&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235598%231991%23999669997%23427033%23FLP%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=5598&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_ct=12&amp;_acct=C000007678&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=7379334&amp;md5=4f1640660b945d83acd6395372867fd7 ] {{doi|10.1016/0141-3910(91)90014-I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purpose and methods of fire-retardant systems ===
The purpose is to control heat below the critical level. To achieve this, one can create an [[endothermic]] environment, produce non-combustible products, or add chemicals that would remove fire-propagating [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]] (H and OH), to name a few. These specific chemicals can be added into the [[polymer]] molecules permanently (see Intrinsically Fire-Resistant Polymers) or as additives and fillers (see Flame-Retardant Additives and Fillers).&lt;ref name="camino" /&gt;

=== Role of oxygen ===
[[Oxygen]] catalyzes the [[pyrolysis]] of [[polymers]] at low concentration and initiates [[oxidation]] at high concentration. Transition concentrations are different for different [[polymers]]. (e.g., [[polypropylene]], between 5% and 15%). Additionally, [[polymers]] exhibit a structural-dependent relationship with [[oxygen]]. Some structures are intrinsically more sensitive to [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]] upon reaction with [[oxygen]]. The amount of access that [[oxygen]] has to the surface of the [[polymer]] also plays a role in [[polymer]] [[combustion]]. [[Oxygen]] is better able to interact with the [[polymer]] before a flame has actually been ignited.&lt;ref name="camino" /&gt;

=== Role of heating rate ===
In most cases, results from a typical heating rate (e.g. 10℃/min for mechanical [[thermal degradation]] studies) do not differ significantly from those obtained at higher heating rates. The extent of reaction can, however, be influenced by the heating rate. For example, some reactions may not occur with a low heating rate due to [[evaporation]] of the products.&lt;ref name="camino" /&gt;

=== Role of pressure ===
[[Volatility (chemistry)|Volatile]] products are removed more efficiently under low pressure, which means the stability of the [[polymer]] might have been compromised. Decreased pressure also slows down [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]] of high boiling products.&lt;ref name="camino" /&gt;

== Intrinsically fire-resistant polymers ==
The [[polymers]] that are most efficient at resisting [[combustion]] are those that are synthesized as intrinsically fire-resistant. However, these types of [[polymers]] can be difficult as well as costly to synthesize. Modifying different properties of the [[polymers]] can increase their intrinsic fire-resistance; increasing [[Stiffness|rigidity]] or [[stiffness]], the use of [[Chemical polarity|polar]] [[monomers]], and/or [[hydrogen bonding]] between the [[polymer]] chains can all enhance fire-resistance.&lt;ref name=frazer&gt;Frazer, A.H. ''High Temperature Resistant Polymers;'' John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1968. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/104021937/abstract ] {{doi|10.1002/app.1969.070130822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Linear, single-stranded polymers with cyclic aromatic components ===
Most intrinsically fire-resistant [[polymers]] are made by incorporation of aromatic cycles or heterocycles, which lend [[Stiffness|rigidity]] and stability to the [[polymers]].&lt;ref name=mallakpour&gt;Mallakpour, S. E.; Hajipour, A.-R.; Mahdavian, A.-R.; Khoee, S. Synthesis and characterization of novel optically active and flame-retardant heterocyclic polyimides. ''J. Appli. Polym. Sci.'' '''2000,''' ''76'' (2), 240-248. {{doi|10.1002/(SICI)1097-4628(20000411)76:2&lt;240::AID-APP13&gt;3.0.CO;2-A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyimides, polybenzoxazoles (PBOs), polybenzimidazoles, and polybenzthiazoles (PBTs) are examples of [[polymers]] made with aromatic heterocycles (Figure 2). [[Image:beckysfigure2b.gif|frame|298x554px|center|Figure 2: Different fire-resistant [[polymers]] made with aromatic heterocycles.]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Polymers]] made with aromatic monomers have a tendency to condense into chars upon [[combustion]], decreasing the amount of flammable gas that is released. Syntheses of these types of [[polymers]] generally employ prepolymers which are further reacted to form the fire-resistant [[polymers]].&lt;ref name=akinseye&gt;Akinseye, T. D.; Harruna, I. I.; Bota, K. B. Processable Precursors .4. Synthesis and Characterization of Processable Precursors to Poly (Phenylene Bixbenzoxazoles). ''Polymer'' '''1997,''' ''38'' (10), 2507-2513. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TXW-3SPKCMG-X&amp;_user=7379334&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F1997&amp;_rdoc=26&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235601%231997%23999619989%2310526%23FLP%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=5601&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_ct=38&amp;_acct=C000007678&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=7379334&amp;md5=9669be418571b2b266c93b729d90935f ] {{doi|10.1016/S0032-3861(96)00778-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ladder polymers ===
[[Ladder polymer]]s are a subclass of [[polymers]] made with aromatic cycles or heterocycles. Ladder [[polymers]] generally have one of two types of general structures, as shown in Figure 3.[[Image:beckysfigure3b.gif|frame|462x256px|center|Figure 3: Two representative structures of different types of ladder [[polymers]].]]&lt;br /&gt;One type of ladder [[polymer]] links two [[polymer]] chains with periodic [[covalent bonds]].&lt;ref name=sirkecioglu&gt;Sirkecioglu, O.; Tunca, A. A.; Talinli, N.; Akar, A. Ladder type polymers from dihydroxyaromatic compounds and dialdehydes. ''Angew. Makrom. Chem.'' '''1999,''' ''271'' (1), 8-10. {{ISSN|0003-3146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another type, the ladder [[polymer]] consists of a single chain that is double-stranded. Both types of ladder [[polymers]] exhibit good resistance to [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]] from heat because the chains do not necessarily fall apart if one [[covalent bond]] is broken. However, this makes the processing of ladder [[polymers]] difficult because they are not easily melted. These difficulties are compounded because ladder polymers are often highly [[insoluble]].

=== Inorganic and semiorganic polymers ===
Inorganic and semiorganic [[polymers]] often employ [[silicon]]-[[nitrogen]], [[boron]]-[[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]]-[[nitrogen]] monomers. The non-burning characteristics of the [[inorganic]] components of these [[polymers]] contribute to their controlled [[flammability]]. For example, instead of forming toxic, flammable gasses in abundance, [[polymers]] prepared with incorporation of [[cyclotriphosphazene]] rings give a high [[char]] yield upon [[combustion]].&lt;ref name="kumar" /&gt; [[Polysialate]]s ([[polymers]] containing frameworks of [[aluminum]], [[oxygen]], and [[silicon]]) are another type of [[inorganic]] [[polymer]] that can be thermally stable up to temperatures of 1300-1400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=barbosa&gt;Barbosa, V. F. F.; MacKenzie, K. J. D.; Thaumaturgo, C. Synthesis and characterization of materials based on inorganic polymers of alumina and silica: sodium polysialate polymers. ''Int. J. Inorg. Mater.'' '''2000,''' ''2'' (4), 309-317. {{doi|10.1016/S1466-6049(00)00041-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flame-retardant additives and fillers ==
Additives are divided into two basic types depending on the interaction of the additive and [[polymer]].&lt;ref name="zhang" /&gt; Reactive [[flame retardant]]s are compounds that are chemically built into the [[polymer]]. They usually contain [[heteroatoms]]. Additive [[flame retardant]]s, on the other hand, are compounds that are not [[covalently]] bound to the [[polymer]]; the flame retardant and the [[polymer]] are just physically mixed together.
Only a few [[Chemical element|elements]] are being widely used in this field:  [[aluminum]], [[phosphorus]], [[nitrogen]], [[antimony]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], and in specific applications [[magnesium]], [[zinc]] and [[carbon]]. One prominent advantage of the flame retardants (FRs) derived from these elements is that they are relatively easy to manufacture. They are used in important quantities: in 2013, the world consumption of FRs amounted to around 1.8/2.1 Mio t for 2013 with sales of 4.9/5.2 billion USD. Market studies estimate FRs demand to rise between 5/7 % pa to 2.4/2.6 Mio t until 2016/2018 with estimated sales of 6.1/7.1 billion USD.&lt;ref&gt;Troitzsch, J.H. Flame retardants. Demands and innovations. 5th International SKZ Conference on Flame Retardant Plastics, Shanghai, China, 21 March '''2014'''&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important flame retardants systems used act either in the gas phase where they remove the high energy radicals H and OH from the flame or in the solid phase, where they shield the polymer by forming a charred layer and thus protect the polymer from being attacked by oxygen and heat.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, M., Weil, E. Mechanisms and modes of action in flame retardancy of polymers, p. 31 f., in Fire retardant materials, Horrocks, R., Price, D. Ed., Woodhead Publishing, '''2004'''&lt;/ref&gt;
Flame retardants based on bromine or chlorine, as well as a number of phosphorus compounds act chemically in the gas phase and are very efficient. Others only act in the condensed phase such as metal hydroxides ([[Aluminium hydroxide|aluminum trihydrate, or ATH]], [[magnesium hydroxide|magnesium hydroxide, or MDH]], and [[boehmite]]), metal oxides and salts (zinc borate and zinc oxide, zinc hydroxystannate), as well as expandable graphite and some nanocomposites (see below). Phosphorus and nitrogen compounds are also effective in the condensed phase, and as they also may act in the gas phase, they are quite efficient flame retardants. Overviews of the main flame retardants families, their mode of action and applications are given in.&lt;ref&gt;Bourbigot, S., Le Bras, M. Flame retardants, p. 133 f. and Eckel, T. Flame retarded plastics, p. 158 f. in Plastics flammability handbook, 3rd Ed., Troitzsch, J. Ed., Hanser Publishers, Munich, '''2004'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weil, E., Levchik S. Flame retardants for plastics and textiles. Practical applications. Hanser Publishers, Munich, '''2009'''&lt;/ref&gt; Further handbooks on these topics are &lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, C., Morgan, A. Fire retardancy of organic materials, 2nd Ed., CRC Press, '''2010'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, A., Wilkie, C. Non halogenated flame retardant handbook, Scrivener Publishing, Wiley, '''2014'''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A good example for a very efficient phosphorus-based flame retardant system acting in the gas and condensed phases is [[aluminium diethyl phosphinate]] in conjunction with synergists such as melamine polyphosphate (MPP) and others. These phosphinates are mainly used to flame retard polyamides (PA) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) for flame retarded applications in electrical engineering/electronics (E&amp;E).&lt;ref&gt;Huang, K.J., Hörold, S., Dietz, M., Schmitt, E. Phosphinates as flame retardants for plastics in electronics. 1st International SKZ Conference on Flame Retardant Plastics, Shanghai, China, 21 September '''2009'''
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural fiber-containing composites ===
Besides providing satisfactory mechanical properties and renewability, [[natural fiber]]s are easier to obtain and much cheaper than man-made materials. Moreover, they are more environmentally friendly.&lt;ref name=kozlowski&gt;Kozlowski, R.; Wladyka-Przybylak, M. Flammability and fire resistance of composites reinforced by natural fibers. ''Polymer Advan. Technol.'' '''2008,''' ''19'' (6), 446-453. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118902268/abstract ] {{doi|10.1002/pat.1135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research focuses on application of different types of [[fire retardant]]s during the manufacturing process as well as applications of [[fire retardant]]s (especially [[intumescent]] coatings) at the finishing stage.&lt;ref name="kozlowski" /&gt;

=== Nanocomposites ===
[[Nanocomposites]] have become a hotspot in the research of fire-safe [[polymers]] because of their relatively low cost and high flexibility for multifunctional properties.&lt;ref name=bourbigot&gt;Bourbigot, S.; Duquesne, S.; Jama C. Polymer Nanocomposites: How to Reach Low Flammability? ''Macromol. Symp.'' '''2006,''' ''233'' (1), 180-190. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112469815/abstract ] {{doi|10.1002/masy.200650123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman and colleagues did the pioneering work by demonstrating the improvement of fire-retardancy by having nanodispersed [[montmorillonite]] clay in the polymer matrix. Later, organomodified [[clays]], TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[nanoparticles]], [[silica]] [[nanoparticles]], [[layered double hydroxides]], [[carbon nanotubes]] and polyhedral [[silsesquioxane]]s were proved to work as well.&lt;ref name="bourbigot" /&gt; Recent research has suggested that combining [[nanoparticles]] with traditional [[fire retardant]]s (e.g., [[intumescent]]s) or with surface treatment (e.g., plasma treatment) effectively decreases [[flammability]].&lt;ref name="bourbigot" /&gt;

=== Problems with additives and fillers ===
Although effective at reducing [[flammability]], flame-retardant additives and fillers have disadvantages as well. Their poor compatibility, high [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] and other deleterious effects can change properties of [[polymers]]. Besides, addition of many fire-retardants produces [[soot]] and [[carbon monoxide]] during [[combustion]]. [[Halogen]]-containing materials cause even more concerns on environmental [[pollution]].&lt;ref name="zhang" /&gt;&lt;ref name=porter&gt;Porter, D.; Metcalfe, E.; Thomas, M. J. K. Nanocomposite Fire Retardants – A Review. ''Fire Mater.'' '''2000,''' ''24'' (1), 45-52. {{doi|10.1002/(SICI)1099-1018(200001/02)24:1&lt;45::AID-FAM719&gt;3.0.CO;2-S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5127">The '''Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty''' (FMCT) is a proposed international [[treaty]] to prohibit the further production of [[fissile]] material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices.  The treaty has not been negotiated and its terms remain to be defined.  According to a proposal by the [[United States]], fissile material includes [[Enriched uranium|high-enriched uranium]] and [[plutonium]] (except plutonium that is over 80% Pu-238).  According to a proposal by Russia, fissile material would be limited to weapons-grade uranium (with more than 90% U-235) and plutonium (with more than 90% Pu-239).  Neither proposal would prohibit the production of fissile material for non-weapons purposes, including use in civil or naval nuclear reactors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fissilematerials.org/ipfm/pages_us_en/fmct/fmct/fmct.php A Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty], International Panel on Fissile Materials, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 27 September 1993 speech before the UN, President Clinton called for a multilateral convention banning the production of fissile materials for nuclear explosives or outside international safeguards. In December 1993 the UN General Assembly adopted resolution 48/75L calling for the negotiation of a "non-discriminatory, multilateral and international effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices." The Geneva-based [[Conference on Disarmament]] (CD) on 23 March 1995 agreed to establish a committee to negotiate "a non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G95/610/27/PDF/G9561027.pdf?OpenElement Shannon Report], CD/1299, March 24, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, substantive negotiations have not taken place.

In 2004, the United States announced that it opposed the inclusion of a verification mechanism in the treaty on the grounds that the treaty could not be effectively verified.  On November 4, 2004, the United States cast the sole vote in the First Committee of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] against a resolution (A/C.1/59/L.34) calling for negotiation of an effectively verifiable treaty.  The [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] supported a treaty but advocated an ad hoc system of verification wherein states would monitor the compliance of other states through their own national intelligence mechanisms.

On April 5, 2009, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] reversed the U.S. position on verification and proposed to negotiate "a new treaty that verifiably ends the production of fissile materials intended for use in state nuclear weapons."  On May 29, 2009, the CD agreed to establish an FMCT negotiating committee,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/E8846993B5213D59C12575DF0029EE11/$file/CD+1864+English.pdf CD/1864], May 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Pakistan]] has repeatedly blocked the CD from implementing its agreed program of work, despite severe pressure from the major nuclear powers to end its defiance of 64 other countries in blocking international ban on the production of new nuclear bomb-making material, as well as discussions on full nuclear disarmament, the arms race in outer space, and security assurances for non-nuclear states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defencetalk.com/pakistan-nuclear-talks-block-21243/ Pakistan feels heat from nuclear powers over talks block], Agence France-Presse, August 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan justified its actions when Chairman joint chiefs General [[Tariq Majid]] argued that "a proposed fissile material cutoff treaty would target Pakistan specifically.&lt;ref name="NPT News Directorate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Officials reports|title=Pakistan a Responsible Nuclear Power, Official Asserts|url=http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/pakistan-a-responsible-nuclear-power-official-asserts/|accessdate=3 December 2012|newspaper=NPT News Directorate|date=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom's [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] a rectangular configuration is used with the government ministers and their party sitting on the right of the presiding Speaker and the opposing parties sitting on the benches opposite.  Members are not permitted to speak between the red lines on the floor which mark the boundaries of each side.  These are traditionally two sword lengths apart to mitigate the possibility of physical conflict.  If a member changes allegiance between the two sides, they are said to [[Crossing the floor|''cross the floor'']].

{{main|Procedures of the United States House of Representatives#House floor}}
The two important debating floors of the [[U.S. Federal government]] are in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]].  The rules of procedure of both floors have evolved to change the balance of power and decision making between the floors and the committees.  Both floors were publicly televised by 1986.  The procedures for passing legislation are quite varied with differing degrees of party, committee and conference involvement.  In general, during the late 20th century, the power of the floors increased and the number of [[Amend (motion)|amendments]] made on the floor increased significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3UpejbY4TQC&amp;pg=PA4 |title=Call to order: floor politics in the House and Senate |author=Steven S. Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures==
The procedures used upon legislative floors are based upon standard works which include

* [[Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice]], which was written for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|UK House of Commons]]
* [[Jefferson's Manual]], which was written for the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] and was incorporated into the rules for the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]].

== Use in other assemblies ==
In other [[Deliberative assembly|deliberative assemblies]], the concept of a "floor" may also be used. The following work was initially based on the procedures used upon legislative floors:
* [[Robert's Rules of Order]], which was based upon the rules of the US House of Representatives and is intended for use by [[Voluntary association|ordinary bodies and societies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = xxix, xliii|edition = 11th|display-authors = etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Franco Modugno''' (born 3 May 1938) is an Italian judge and former law professor at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]]. He has been Judge of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy]] since 21 December 2015. 

==Career==
Modugno was born in [[Rome]] on 3 May 1938.&lt;ref name=court&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/ActionPagina_321.do |title=The Constitutional Court: Composition of the Court |publisher=Constitutional Court of Italy |date= |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained a degree in Jurisprudence from the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] in 1961. Six years later Modugno started as lecturer of constitutional law at the [[University of Teramo]]. He held similar positions at the [[University of Macerata]] from 1972 to 1973 and the [[University of Salerno]] from 1973 to 1975. In 1975 he started as a professor of Public Law at the Sapienza University and later also held a chair in constitutional law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://giurisprudenza.luiss.it/en/docenti/cv/10308 |title=Franco Modugno Curriculum |language=Italian |publisher=Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli |date= |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November, the [[Italian Parliament]] failed to elect three candidates to the Constitutional Court; Modugno obtained 140 votes, primarily coming from the [[Five Star Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2015/11/25/parliament-fails-to-elect-constitutional-court-judges_17019408-498f-4348-b45f-fed7ac64c1f4.html |title=Parliament fails to elect Constitutional Court judges |publisher=ANSA |date=25 November 2015 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modugno was elected to the Constitutional Court by the Parliament on 16 December 2015, and he was sworn in five days later.&lt;ref name=court/&gt;

Modugno was made Knight in the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]] on 27 December 1993.

The '''Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005''' ({{lang-gd|Achd na Gàidhlig (Alba) 2005}}) is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] passed in 2005, and is the first piece of [[Scottish Parliament legislation|legislation]] to give formal recognition to the [[Scottish Gaelic language]].

==Passage of the Act==
The bill was introduced into the Scottish Parliament on 28 September 2004 by [[Peter Peacock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3695348.stm |title=Ministers unveil new Gaelic law |work=BBC News |date=28 September 2004 |accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 August 2005 the Parliament voted unanimously to approve the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4467769.stm |title=MSPs rule against Gaelic equality |work=BBC News |date=21 April 2005 |accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The Gaelic Language Act aims to secure Gaelic as an [[official language]] of [[Scotland]], "commanding equal respect" with [[English language|English]], by establishing {{lang|gd|[[Bòrd na Gàidhlig]]}} as part of the framework of [[government in Scotland]] and also requiring the creation of a national plan for Gaelic to provide strategic direction for the development of the Gaelic language.  [Note: The phrase "equal respect" contains no clear meaning in the law. Its usage was chosen to prevent the assumption that the Gaelic language is in any way considered to have "equal validity or parity of esteem with English".]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McLeod |first=Wilson |title=Gaelic in contemporary Scotland: contradictions, challenges and strategies |page=7 |location=University of Edinburgh  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also gives {{lang|gd|Bòrd na Gàidhlig}} a key role in promoting Gaelic in Scotland, advising [[Scottish Ministers]] on Gaelic issues, driving forward Gaelic planning and preparing guidance on Gaelic education. The Act also provides a framework for the creation of Gaelic language plans by Scottish public authorities.

Former Education Minister [[Peter Peacock]], who, at the time of the Act coming into force, had ministerial responsibility for Gaelic, said: "This is a momentous day for Gaelic as we open a new chapter in the language's history. We have come a long way since the dark days of 1616 when an Act of Parliament ruled that Gaelic should be 'abolishit and removit' from Scotland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/report.aspx?r=4560&amp;i=34453|title=Official Report|date=2 February 2005|publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]]|accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key limitation of the act is that it applies only to public bodies operating in Scotland and whose business is classed as being a [[devolved]] matter (outlined by the [[Scotland Act 1998]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2005/asp_20050007_en_1#pb5-l1g10 |title=Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 (s.10) |date=1 June 2005 |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=2008-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907081446/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2005/asp_20050007_en_1 |archivedate=7 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The National Gaelic Language Plan 2012–17==
"The Plan includes proposals for the promotion of strategies for increasing the number able to speak Gaelic, encouraging its use and facilitating access to Gaelic language and culture." The Plan addresses the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = National Gaelic Language Plan | url = http://www.gaidhlig.org.uk/bord/en/national-plan-for-gaelic/index.php |publisher={{lang|gd|[[Bòrd na Gàidhlig]]}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* An increase in the acquisition and use of Gaelic by young people in the home and increased numbers of children entering Gaelic-medium early years education.
* An increase in the number of children enrolling in Gaelic-medium education (GME), doubling the current annual intake to 800 by 2017. 
* A year on year increase in the number of pupils engaged in Gaelic-learner education (GLE) in both primary and secondary schools.
* An expansion in the availability of Gaelic-medium subjects in secondary schools.
* An increase in the number of adults acquiring Gaelic from the current total of around 2,000 to 3,000 by 2017 and enhanced language skills among fluent Gaelic speakers. 
* More opportunities for communities and networks of Gaelic speakers of all kinds to use Gaelic and increased use of the language in community activities and services.
* Expansion of the use of Gaelic in places of work and an increase in employment opportunities where Gaelic skills are required in order to enable service delivery in the language.
* Development of Gaelic arts and media as a means of promoting the language, attracting people to it and enhancing their commitment through opportunities to learn, use and develop Gaelic.
* An increased profile for Gaelic in the heritage and tourism sectors and increased use of Gaelic in the interpretation of Scotland’s history and culture.
* Co-ordination of the initiatives of parties active in Gaelic language corpus development to achieve enhanced strength, relevance, consistency and visibility of the Gaelic language in Scotland.

'''''Habeas data''''' is a [[writ]] and [[Legal remedy|constitutional remedy]] available in certain nations. The literal translation from Latin of ''habeas data'' is “[we command] you have the data”. The remedy varies from country to country, but in general, it is designed to protect, by means of an individual complaint presented to a constitutional court, the [[data]], image, privacy, honour, information self-determination and freedom of information of a person.

''Habeas data'' can be sought by any citizen against any manual or automated data register to find out what information is held about his or her person. That person can request the rectification, actualisation or even the destruction of the personal data held. The legal nature of the individual complaint of ''habeas data'' is that of voluntary jurisdiction, this means that the person whose privacy is being compromised can be the only one to present it. The Courts do not have any power to initiate the process by themselves.

==History==
''Habeas data'' is an individual complaint file before a [[Constitutional Court]] and related to the privacy of personal data. The first such complaint is the ''[[habeas corpus]]'' (which is roughly translated as “[we command] you have the body”). Other individual complaints include the writ of [[mandamus]] (USA), [[amparo (law)|amparo]] (Spain, Mexico and [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|Argentina]]), and [[respondeat superior]] (Taiwan).

The habeas data writ itself has a very short history, but its origins can be traced to certain European legal mechanisms that protected individual privacy. In particular, certain German constitutional rights can be identified as the direct progenitors of the Habeas Data right. In particular, the right to information self-determination was created by the German Constitutional Tribunal by interpretation of the existing rights of human dignity and personality . This is a right to know what type of data are stored on manual and automatic databases about an individual, and it implies that there must be transparency on the gathering and processing of such data. The other direct predecessor of the Habeas Data right is the Council of Europe’s 108th Convention on Data Protection of 1981. The purpose of the convention is to secure the privacy of the individual regarding the automated processing of personal data. To achieve this, several rights are given to the individual, including a right to access their personal data held in an automated database.&lt;ref&gt;Andres Guadamuz, [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/jilt/2000_2/guadamuz "Habeas Data: The Latin American response to data protection"], Journal of Information, Law &amp; Technology 2000(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first country to implement Habeas Data was the Federal Republic of [[Brazil]]. In 1988, the Brazilian legislature voted to introduce a new Constitution, which included a novel right never seen before: the Habeas Data individual complaint. It is expressed as a full constitutional right under article 5, LXXII, of the Constitution.

Following the Brazilian example, Colombia incorporated the Habeas Data right to its new Constitution in 1991. After that, many countries followed suit and adopted the new legal tool in their respective constitutions: Paraguay in 1992, Peru in 1993, Argentina in 1994, and Ecuador in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Andres Guadamuz, [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/jilt/2001_3/guadamuz "Habeas Data vs. the European Data Protection Directive"], The Journal of Information, Law &amp; Technology 2001(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1999 and 2012  several Latin American countries have enacted data protection laws where the procedure to file an habeas data writ is regulated.

==Implementation==
* [[Brazil]]: The 1988 Brazilian Constitution stipulates that: “Habeas Data shall be granted: a) to ensure the knowledge of information related to the person of the petitioner, contained in records or databanks of government agencies or of agencies of a public character; b) for the correction of data, when the petitioner does not prefer to do so through a confidential process, either judicial or administrative”.
* [[Paraguay]]: The 1992 Paraguay constitution follows the example set by Brazil, but enhances the protection in several ways. The Article 135 of the Paraguayan constitution states: “Everyone may have access to information and data available on himself or assets in official or private registries of a public nature. He is also entitled to know how the information is being used and for what purpose. He may request a competent judge to order the updating, rectification, or destruction of these entries if they are wrong or if they are illegitimately affecting his rights.”
* [[Argentina]]: the Argentinian version of Habeas Data is the most complete to date. The article 43 of the Constitution, amended on the 1994 reform, states that: “Any person shall file this action to obtain information on the data about himself and their purpose, registered in public records or data bases, or in private ones intended to supply information; and in case of false data or discrimination, this action may be filed to request the suppression, rectification, confidentiality or updating of said data. The secret nature of the sources of journalistic information shall not be impaired.”&lt;ref&gt;Pablo Palazzi, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080612194347/http://www.alfa-redi.org/rdi-articulo.shtml?x=179 "El Habeas Data en el Derecho Argentino"], Alfa-Redi No.4, November 1998. (Archived from [http://www.alfa-redi.org/rdi-articulo.shtml?x=179 the original] on June 12, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Philippines]]: On August 25, 2007, [[Chief Justice]] [[Reynato Puno]] (at the College of Law alumni of [[Silliman University]] in [[Dumaguete]] City) announced that the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] was drafting the [[writ]] of Habeas Data. By invoking the [[truth]], the new remedy  will not only compel [[military]] and [[government]] [[espionage|agents]] to release information about the [[desaparecidos]] but require access to military and [[police]] files. [[Reynato Puno]] announced earlier on the draft of the ''writ of amparo'' – the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for protection—which will prevent military officials in [[judicial]] [[proceedings]] to simply issue denials on cases of [[forced disappearance|disappearances]] or [[extrajudicial]] [[executions]]. With the [[writ of habeas corpus]], the writ of Habeas Data and the ''writ of amparo'' will further help those looking for missing loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=85704  Inquirer.net, SC drafting writ of habeas data invoking right to truth]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hale v. Henkel''''', 201 U.S. 43 (1906), was a major [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court established the power of a [[federal grand jury]] engaged in an investigation into corporate [[malfeasance]] to require the corporation in question to surrender its records.

==Background==
Edwin F. Hale, the petitioner, was the treasurer of [[MacAndrews and Forbes]].&lt;ref name=law360&gt;{{cite web| title =High Court May Take On Corporate 5th Amendment Privilege| work =Law360| url =http://www.law360.com/articles/634828/high-court-may-take-on-corporate-5th-amendment-privilege}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1850, MacAndrews and Forbes was one of six companies that were under investigation for [[price fixing]] of [[tobacco]], in violation of the [[Sherman Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/201/90/case.html | title=McAlister v. Henkel  201 U.S. 90 (1906) | publisher=JUSTIA | work=US Supreme Court | accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Justia/&gt;

In 1906, US government prosecutors served a [[grand jury]] [[subpoena]] on Hale that demanded him to testify and turn over corporate documents. Hale appeared before the jury but refused to reply to questions or to produce documents. On his company's behalf, he invoked the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] privilege and was held in [[contempt of court|contempt]]. Hale then hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit, which ultimately came before the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=law360/&gt;

Hale's argument was that a grand jury cannot require persons representing corporations to testify or demand them to produce documents unless the charges that are being investigated are first explained.

==Decision==
In a majority opinion written by [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Justice]] [[Henry Billings Brown|Henry B. Brown]], the Court rejected Hale's argument by maintaining that a grand jury can examine witnesses and demand documentary evidence in connection with a probe into possible crimes, even if it did not identify the scope of its investigation.

The Court then rejected Hale's privilege claim by ruling that the [[self-incrimination]] privilege provided to citizens by the Fifth Amendment did not apply to corporations.&lt;ref name=Justia/&gt;

In short, the Court held that corporate employees cannot assert the privilege against self-incrimination on behalf of their employer. The Fifth Amendment guarantee "protects individual civil liberties, not economic business interests." The principle that "corporations and other collective entities are treated differently from individuals" under the Fifth Amendment is called the collective entity rule.&lt;ref name=law360/&gt;

The defendant of record in the case was William Henkel, US Marshal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fx0pAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA199&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;dq=william+henkel+hale+v.+henkel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CI4XE6VCnK&amp;sig=yPmfM_L_EHu_8KsFsrwalxNnri0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDmK2f64LPAhUEdD4KHY6pCQIQ6AEIUTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20henkel%20hale%20v.%20henkel&amp;f=false | title=Freight, Volumes 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8QorAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA46&amp;lpg=RA2-PA46&amp;dq=william+henkel+hale+v.+henkel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-UZnAtX95M&amp;sig=Bivtyu5z67Zo9SIKviVRhtTbfuk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDmK2f64LPAhUEdD4KHY6pCQIQ6AEIUzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20henkel%20hale%20v.%20henkel&amp;f=false | title=Cases and Points of the Supreme Court of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
"There is a clear distinction between an individual and a corporation, and the latter, being a creature of the State, has not the constitutional right to refuse to submit its books and papers for an examination at the suit of the State."&lt;ref name=Justia&gt;{{cite web | url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/201/43/case.html | title=Hale v.

"The individual may stand upon his constitutional rights as a citizen. He is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way. His power to contract is unlimited. He owes no duty to the State or to his neighbors to divulge his business, or to open his doors to an investigation, so far as it may tend to criminate [sic] him. He owes no such duty to the State, since he receives nothing therefrom beyond the protection of his life and property. His rights are such as existed by the law of the land long antecedent to the organization of the State, and can only be taken from him by due process of law, and in accordance with the Constitution. Among his rights are a refusal to incriminate himself and the immunity of himself and his property from arrest or seizure except under a warrant of the law. He owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their rights."&lt;ref name=Justia/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Court's subsequent ruling in ''Wilson v. United States'' (1911) built upon ''Hale v. Henkel'' by prohibiting corporate officers from invoking their own personal Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to justify a failure to turn over corporate documents. Such a use of the Fifth Amendment privilege, according to the Court, would inhibit the state's visitatorial rights over corporations.&lt;ref name=law360/&gt; Later Supreme Court decisions applied the principle established in ''Hale v. Henkel'' to unions (''[[United States v. White]]'' (1944)), partnerships (''[[Bellis v. United States]]'' (1974)), and sole proprietorships (''[[United States v. Doe]]'' (1984)). The cases have reflected the Court's consistent view that the Fifth Amendment privilege should apply to only individual human beings, not artificial entities.&lt;ref name=law360/&gt;

On the other hand, the ruling in ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'' (2010) granted corporations an unfettered right of political free speech, and ''[[Burwell v. Hobby Lobby]]'' (2014) recognized corporations' religious liberties. One observer has described these two most recent rulings as "underscoring a deep rift on the Roberts court about the permissible (or desirable) extent of corporate personhood under the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]."&lt;ref name=law360/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5671">{{Constitutions of Poland}}

The '''Henrician Articles''' or '''King Henry's Articles''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Artykuły henrykowskie'', [[Latin]]: ''Articuli Henriciani'') were a permanent contract between the "Polish nation" (i.e., the [[Szlachta|szlachta (nobility)]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]) and a newly elected [[king]] upon his [[Royal elections in Poland|election to the throne]] that stated the fundamental principles of governance and [[constitutional law]] in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tk/&gt;

While ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|pacta conventa]]'' comprised only the personal undertakings of the [[king-elect]], the Henrician Articles were a permanent statute that all kings-elect had to swear to respect.&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-84-86"/&gt;

The articles functioned, essentially, as a first constitution for Poland until the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]].&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tk/&gt;

== Origins ==
The charter took the form of 18 Articles written and adopted by the [[szlachta|nobility]] in 1573 at the town of [[Kamień, Białobrzegi County|Kamień]], near [[Warsaw]], during the [[interregnum]] following the extinction of the [[Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon]] [[dynasty]].&lt;ref name=tk/&gt;  The document took its name from that of [[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]], the first [[Poland|Polish]] [[monarch|king]] elected in a [[Royal elections in Poland|free election]], who was obliged to sign the Articles before being allowed to ascend the throne.&lt;ref name=tk/&gt; Subsequently every king-elect was required to swear fidelity to them, as is contrasted with the similar documents, the ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|pacta conventa]]'', which were tailored and different for each king-elect.&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt; Acceptance by the king-elect of the articles was a condition of his elevation to the throne, and they formed part of the royal oath at the coronation.&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt;

== Provisions ==
The provisions of the Henrician Articles stated that:
* kings of the Commonwealth were all to be chosen by election by the [[szlachta]], and his children had no right of inheritance with regard to the throne;&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt;
* king marriages had to gain the approval of the [[Senate]];&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-84-86"/&gt;
* the king must convene a [[general sejm]] (Polish parliament) at least once every two years for six weeks;&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt;
* the king had no right to create new taxes, tariffs or such without approval of the [[Sejm]];&lt;ref name=tk/&gt;
* between sejms, 16 resident [[senator]]s were to be at the king's side as his advisers and overseers.&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tk/&gt; This Royal Council of 16 senators was elected every two years during the [[Sejm]] session. Four of their number (rotating every six months) were obliged to accompany the king and serve as advisers and supervisors to ensure that the king made no decision contrary to the laws of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=tk/&gt; All royal decrees had to be counter-stamped by the [[Chancellor (Poland)|chancellors]] or the deputy chancellors.&lt;ref name=tk/&gt;
* the king had no right to call a ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]'' ([[levée en masse]]) without approval of the [[Sejm]]. Further, the Articles upheld the informal tradition that the king could not send those troops to serve outside the Commonwealth's borders without compensation.&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt;
* provide for the standing, royal army ([[wojsko kwarciane]]);&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt;
* the king had no right to declare war or peace without approval of the [[Sejm]];&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt;
* the king must abide by the [[Warsaw Confederation]]'s guarantees of religious freedom;&lt;ref name=tk/&gt;
* finally, if the monarch were to transgress against the law or the [[privileges of szlachta]], the Articles authorized the [[szlachta]] [[right of rebellion|to refuse the king's orders and act against him]] (in Polish practice it became known as the ''[[rokosz]]'').&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-84-86"/&gt; Each king had to swear that "if anything has been done by Us against laws, liberties, privileges or customs, we declare all the inhabitants of the Kingdom are freed from obedience to Us".&lt;ref name=tk/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30759">'''Human rights movement''' refers to a [[nongovernmental]] [[social movement]] engaged in activism related to the issues of [[human rights]]. The foundations of the global human rights movement involve resistance to: colonialism, imperialism, slavery, racism, apartheid, patriarchy, and oppression of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, ''Human Rights'' (2007), p. 19. "In fact, the modern civil rights movement and the complex normative international framework have grown out of a number of transnational and widespread movements. Human rights were invoked and claimed in the contexts of anti-colonialism, anti-imperialism, anti-slavery, anti-apartheid, anti-racism, and feminist and indigenous struggles everywhere."&lt;/ref&gt;

A key principle of the human rights movement is its appeal to [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]]: the idea that all human beings should struggle in [[solidarity]] for a common set of basic conditions that has to be followed by all.&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, ''Human Rights'' (2007), p. 19–20. "...the sense of solidarity amongst those who believe they are the victims of a human rights violation can transcend class, gender, and other distinctions. This sense of connectedness is critical to understanding the changing world of human rights."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|History of human rights}}
Human rights activism predates the 20th century, and includes, for example, the [[abolitionism|anti-slavery movement]].&lt;ref name="Leonard2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, ''Human Rights'' (2007), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Historical movements were usually concerned with a limited set of issues, and they were more local than global.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-7-9"/&gt; One account identifies the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907#Hague Convention of 1899|1899 Hague Convention]] as a starting point for the idea that humans have rights independent of the states that control them.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), pp. 40–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The activities of the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (originally the International Labor Organization)—founded in France by the international labor movement in the 1920s—can be seen as a precursor to the modern movements.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-7-9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; This organization was quickly embraced by the United States and European powers, perhaps as a way to counteract the [[Bolshevik]] call for global solidarity among workers.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-colonialism===
[[File:MutilatedChildrenFromCongo.jpg|thumb|300px|Human rights activists circulated images of mutilated Congolese children among concerned Europeans and Americans, pressuring the Belgium government to make political reforms]]
Another major global human rights movement grew out of [[Anti-colonialism|resistance to colonialism]]. The [[Congo Reform Association]], founded in 1904, has also been described as a foundational modern human rights movement. This group used photographs to document terror wrought by Belgians in the course of demanding rubber production in the Congo. These photographs were passed among sympathetic Europeans and Americans, including [[E. D. Morel|Edmund Morel]], [[Joseph Conrad]], and [[Mark Twain]]—who [[King Leopold's Soliloquy|wrote satirically as King Leopold]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...oh well, the pictures get sneaked around everywhere, in spite of all we can do to ferret them out and suppress them. Ten thousand pulpits and ten thousand presses are saying the good word for me all the time and placidly and convincingly denying the mutilations. Then that trivial little kodak, that a child can carry in its pocket, gets up, uttering never a word, and knocks them dumb!&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Twain]], ''[[King Leopold's Soliloquy]]'', quoted in: Bruce Michelson, ''Printer's Devil: Mark Twain and the American Publishing Revolution'', University of California Press, {{ISBN|9780520247598}}, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The photos and subsequent literature triggered international outrage at Belgian crimes committed against the Congolese.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Sliwinski, "[http://tps.jkdweb.biz/sites/default/files/uploads/Sliwinski_Kodak_Congo.pdf The Childhood of Human Rights: The Kodak on the Congo]", ''Journal of Visual Culture'' 5(3), 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the century went on, African Americans including [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Walter Francis White|Walter White]], and Paul Robeson joined with leaders of the [[African diaspora]] (from Haiti, Liberia, the Philippines, and elsewhere) to make a global demand for basic rights.&lt;ref&gt;Von Eschen, ''Race Against Empire'' (1997), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Skretny&gt;John David Skretny, "The effect of the Cold War on African-American civil rights: America and the world audience, 1945–1968", ''Theory and Society'' 27(2), 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the origins of this movement were multifaceted (owing strength both to the capitalist [[Marcus Garvey]] and to the more left-wing [[African Blood Brotherhood]]), a definitive moment of international solidarity came after [[Second Italo–Ethiopian War|Italy's annexation of Ethiopia]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Von Eschen, ''Race Against Empire'' (1997), pp. 10–11. "The Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 marked an especially critical moment in the articulation of diaspora thought and politics. Paul Robeson claimed it was a watershed for black American consciousness, since it exposed 'the parallel between [black American] interests and those of oppressed peoples abroad.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II and the United Nations===
In the [[aftermath of World War II]], the Pan-Africanist contingent played a major role in causing the United Nations to explicitly protect "human rights" in its founding documents. Du Bois compared colonies across the world to ghettos in the United States and called for a world document affirming the human rights of all people.&lt;ref name="Skretny"/&gt;

Representatives of small countries (particularly from Latin America), as well as Du Bois and other activists, were unhappy with the version of human rights envisioned for the UN Charter at [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Du Bois stated at the time that, evidently, "the only way to human equality is through the philanthropy of the masters".&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the US government supported powerful domestic organizations willing to promote its concept of human rights, such as the [[American Bar Association]] and the [[American Jewish Committee]]. These organizations won public approval of the United Nations and the human rights concept.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of human rights was indeed built into [[United Nations]] with institutions such as the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Active diplomacy by Latin American countries was instrumental to the process of promoting these ideas and drafting the relevant agreements. As a result of this pressure, more human rights language was adopted at the 1945 [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|San Francisco Conference]] to create the UN Charter.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 118. "These proposals were reintroduced in San Francisco during the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Latin America's significant intellectual production supporting human rights is a major reason the region has been called 'the forgotten crucible' of universal human rights. Latin American jurisprudence was particularly well suited to bridging cultural divides in human rights by linking civil and political rights with economic and social rights."&lt;/ref&gt; Revelations about the [[Holocaust]], followed by the [[Nuremberg Trials]], also had a major influence on the movement,&lt;ref name="Neier2012-2-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Langley1999"/&gt; particularly among Jewish and Christian lobbying groups.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Some NGO's represented the UN charter as a victory for the human rights movement, while other activists argued that it paid lipservice to human rights while basically serving the interests of the great powers.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), pp. 136–138. "A few activists, in particular those whose agenda focused on racial equality and decolonization, were dismayed by the results of San Francisco. The NAACP and allied groups, which had invested significant time, resources, and hopes in using the global forum to highlight the evils of entrenched racism inside the United States and internationally, were bitterly disappointed at the outcome. To no avail, they criticized the failure to dent the vastly unequal power relations operating both between states and within their borders. Rayford Logan, civil rights activist and chair of the history department at Howard University, characterized the human rights articles in the Charter as a 'tragic joke'. But these were minority voices. Just as Roosevelt anticipated, the NGO consultants were thrilled with the role they had played in establishing the organization and fanned out across the country to spread the good news."&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the [[Cold War]], the "human rights" concept was used to promote the ideological agendas of the superpowers.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union]] argued that people in colonized lands around the world had been exploited by Western powers. A large percentage of [[Soviet propaganda]] to the [[Third World]] centered on charges of racism and human rights violations. The United States countered with its own propaganda, describing its own society as free and the Soviet Union's as unfree. Human rights language became an international standard, which could be used by great powers or by people's movements to make demands.&lt;ref name=Skretny/&gt;

===Global human rights struggles===
Within the United States, participants in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] called for human rights in addition to civil rights. Du Bois, the [[National Negro Congress]] (NNC), the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), the [[Civil Rights Congress]] (CRC), and other activists, soon began charging the U.S. with human rights violations at the U.N. In 1951, Du Bois, [[William L. Patterson|William Patterson]] and the CRC presented a document called "[[We Charge Genocide]]" which accused the US of complicity with ongoing systematic violence against [[African American]]s.&lt;ref name=Skretny/&gt;

[[An Appeal for Human Rights]], published by Atlanta students in 1960, is cited as a key moment in beginning the wave of [[nonviolent direct action]]s that swept the [[American South]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward A. Hatfield, "[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-3615 Atlanta Sit-ins]", ''The New Georgia Encyclopedia'', 28 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, less than a year before he was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|assassinated]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] began to argue that the concept of "civil rights" was laden with isolating, individualistic [[Capitalism|capitalist]] values. He said: "It is necessary for us to realize that we have moved from the era of civil rights to the era of human rights. When you deal with human rights you are not dealing with something clearly defined in the Constitution. They are rights that are clearly defined by the mandates of a humanitarian concern."&lt;ref&gt;Sam Trumbore, "[http://blog.timesunion.com/trumbore/from-civil-rights-to-human-rights-kings-legacy-for-us/986/ From Civil Rights to Human Rights, King’s Legacy For Us]", ''Times Union'', 15 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For King, who began to organize the multi-racial [[Poor People's Campaign]] at the end of his life, human rights required [[economic justice]] in addition to [[de jure]] equality.&lt;ref&gt;Tomas F. Jackson, ''From Civil Rights to Human Rights: Martin Luther King, Jr., And the Struggle for Economic Justice'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007. {{ISBN|9780812239690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[decolonization of Africa]] and [[Decolonization of Asia|of Asia]], former colonies gained majority status in the UN's Commission on Human Rights, and focused their attention on global [[white supremacy]] and [[economic inequality]]—in doing so, choosing to admit other types of human rights abuses. Some of these nations argued that focusing on civil rights, as opposed to human rights, was a privilege available only to the wealthy nations that had benefited from colonialism.&lt;ref name=Skretny/&gt; Demands for human rights in the [[Third World]] increased throughout the 1960s, even as the global superpowers turned their attention elsewhere.&lt;ref name=TsutsuiWotipka&gt;Kiyoteru Tsutsui and Christine Min Wotipka, "Global Civil Society and the International Human Rights Movement: Citizen Participation in Human Rights International Nongovernmental Organization", ''Social Forces'' 83(2), 2004; accessed [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3598341 via JStor], DOI: 10.1353/sof.2005.0022.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in the 1970s===
Since the 1970s the human rights movement has played an increasingly important role on the international scene.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-2-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.)Bertucci1996"/&gt; Although government support for human rights decreased, international organizations increased in strength and number.&lt;ref name=TsutsuiWotipka/&gt; Some of the events of the 1970s, which gave global prominence to the human movements issue, included the abuses of Chilean [[Augusto Pinochet]] and American [[Richard Nixon]] administrations; the signing of the [[Helsinki Accords]] (1975) between [[Western world|the West]] and the [[USSR]]; the [[Soweto riots]] in [[South Africa]]; awarding of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] to [[Amnesty International]] (1977); and the emergence of the [[Democracy Wall]] movement in China.&lt;ref name="H.)Bertucci1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neier2012-3-4"/&gt; Nixon was succeeded by the [[Jimmy Carter]] administration, much more supportive of the human rights issues.

Pressure from the international human rights movement brought human rights increasingly to the political agenda of numerous countries and diplomatic negotiations.&lt;ref name="H.)Bertucci1996"/&gt; As the issue of human rights became important for [[dissidents]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]] ([[Human rights movement in the Soviet Union|Soviet human rights movement]], [[Charter 77]], [[Workers' Defence Committee]]), this period also saw a growing [[framing (sociology)|reframing]] of the struggle between the West and USSR from the economic terms ("[[communism]] versus [[free market]]") into a struggle for human rights ("[[totalitarianism]] versus [[liberty]]").&lt;ref name="Neier2012-13"/&gt; Since the end of the [[Cold War]], the issues of human rights have been present in a number of major political and military conflicts, debated by global public opinion, from [[Kosovo]] to [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] and [[Darfur]].&lt;ref name="Neier2012-17"/&gt;

Originally, most international human rights organizations came from France and the UK; since the 1970s American organizations moved beyond rights for Americans to partake in the international scene, and around the turn of the century, as noted by Neier, "the movement became so global in character that it is no longer possible to ascribe leadership to any particular [national or regional] segment".&lt;ref name="Neier2012-10-11"/&gt; However, others, like [[Bonny Ibhawoh|Ibhawoh]], point out that there still is a gap between regions, particularly as most of the international human rights movement organizations are located in the [[global North]], and thus continuous concerns are raised about their understanding of the situations in the [[global South]].&lt;ref name="BellCoicaud2006"/&gt;

===Since the 1990s===
The global human rights movement has become more expansive since the 1990s, including greater representation of women's rights and economic justice as part of the human rights umbrella. [[Economic, social and cultural rights|Economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights]] gained new prominence.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Dorsey, ''New Rights Advocacy'' (2008), p. 14. "Since the mid-1990s the human rights movement has begun to take seriously the economic and social rights guaranteed in the international human rights covenants; development and human rights NGOs have joined in human rights–driven social movements for food, health, education, water, and other rights, often challenging development orthodoxy."&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for women's human rights (sometimes identifying as part of the [[feminist movement]]), criticized the early human rights movement for focusing on male concerns and artificially excluding women's issues from the [[public sphere]]. Women's rights have nevertheless gained prominence in the international human rights movement, particularly insofar as they include protection from [[gender-based violence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlotte Bunch]], "Transforming Human Rights From a Feminist Perspective", in ''Women's Rights, Human Rights'', (1995) ed. Stone &amp; Wolper.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Latin America]], the issue of women's human rights intersects with the struggle against authoritarian governments. In many cases (see: the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]]) women's groups were some of the most prominent advocates of human rights in general.&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;Elisabeth Friedman, "Women's Human Rights: The Emergence of a Movement", in ''Women's Rights, Human Rights'', (1995) ed. Stone &amp; Wolper.&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream acceptance of women's human rights within the international human rights movement has increased since 1989.&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;

The authority of the United Nations human rights framework diminished in the 1990s, partly due to the emphasis on economic liberalization that followed the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Dorsey, ''New Rights Advocacy'' (2008), p. 51. "The 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna was expected by some to be a celebration of the post–cold war era, the new freedom of the United Nations to operate in a less politicized international environment, and NGO human rights successes. Instead it marked a watershed moment for the integrity of the human rights system, as NGOs battled a coalition of governments determined to undermine the principle of the universality of human rights standards and weaken the UN human rights system. [...] The challenge to shore up the fundamental concept of universality of rights was compounded by shifts in the foreign policy priorities of Western governments. A new Democratic administration in the United States made promoting free-market democracies, rather than human rights, its top priority, resulting in human rights regressions, including the delinking of trade and aid from human rights guarantees (Mann 1999)."&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s also saw a call to "defend the defenders" of human rights—to protect human rights activists from violence and repression.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Dorsey, ''New Rights Advocacy'' (2008), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there has been an increase in the number of attacks on the activists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement has come to a standstill as individuals continue to push for liberation but are unable to report their findings out of fear of harm or death. The number of female activists has been growing since the beginning of the Feminist movement however, there have been increased number of attacks on women. Recently, the Taliban targeted the female activists to send a message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[internet]] has expanded the power of the human rights movement by improving communication between activists in different physical locations.&lt;ref&gt;Halpin and Hoskins,  ''Human Rights and the Internet'' (2000), pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as mediated mobilization. Individuals who are using their voices to communicate about the injustices are now able to communicate with like minded people who use their voices through participatory journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The human rights movement has historically focused on abuses by states, and some have argued that it has not attended closely enough to the actions of corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. xix. "...business corporations (especially transnational ones) are often more powerful than states, and therefore enjoy the capacity to promote or undermine the rights and well-being of individuals and groups. Yet, the human rights movement, as it initially developed, did not seek to make business corporations accountable for human rights abuses, such as child labor, business-supported political repression, environmental degradation, and sexual harassment..."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some first steps were taken towards holding corporations accountable for human rights abuses. For example, the Parliament of Britain approved a resolution to censure [[British Petroleum]] for funding Colombian death squads.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and activities==
[[File:United Workers picketers.jpg|thumb|270px|[[United Workers]] demonstrating for human rights and fair development in Baltimore's [[Inner Harbor]].]]
The international human rights movement is concerned with issues such as deprivation of life and liberty, deprivation of the right of [[free speech|free and peaceful expressions]], gatherings and worship,&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; equal treatment regardless of individual background, and opposition to unjust and cruel practices such as [[torture]].&lt;ref name="Neier2012-2-3"/ 
Other issues include opposition to the death penalty&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. 41, 256.&lt;/ref&gt; and to child labor.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the human rights movement is local in nature, concerned with human rights violations in their own countries, but they rely on an international network of support.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-11"/&gt; The international nature of the movement allows local activists to broadcast their concerns, sometimes generating international pressure on their home government.&lt;ref name=TsutsuiWotipka/&gt; The movement generally espouses the principle that sovereignty ends where human rights begin. This principle justifies intervention across borders to rectify perceived violations.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The human rights movement is also credited with supplying local activists with a vocabulary to use in support of their claims.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;[[David Kennedy (jurist)|David Kennedy]], "[http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/dkennedy/publications/humanrights.pdf The International Human Rights Movement: Part of the Problem?]" 15 ''Harvard Human Rights Journal'' 101, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations and criticism==
One major schism within the international human rights movement has been between NGOs and activists from the [[First World|First]] and [[Third World|Third]] Worlds. Critics of the mainstream movement have argued that it suffers from systemic biases and is unwilling to confront inequality on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, some critique the role of neoliberal capitalism in creating economic conditions that engender 'human rights violations', arguing that the dominant human rights movement is blind to these dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 325–326.&lt;/ref&gt; (''See also:'' [[structural adjustment]].) [[Makau W. Mutua|Makau Mutua]] has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As currently constituted and deployed, the human rights movement will ultimately fail because it is perceived as an alien ideology in non-Western societies. The movement does not deeply resonate in the cultural fabrics of non-Western states, except among hypocritical elites steeped in Western ideas. In order ultimately to prevail, the human rights movement must be moored in the cultures of all peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[Makau W. Mutua|Makau Mutua]], ''Human Rights: A Political and Cultural Critique'' (2002), quoted in Clapham, ''Human Rights'' (2007), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Kennedy (jurist)|David Kennedy]] has criticized a tendency of the international human rights movement to "treat human rights as an object of devotion rather than calculation", arguing that human rights language is vague and may impede [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] assessments of a situation. Kennedy also argues that this vocabulary can be "misused, distorted, or co-opted", and that framing issues in terms of human rights may narrow the field of possibility and exclude other narratives.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt; Others have also critiqued the movement and its language as vague.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that the human rights movement has a tendency to subtly debase people by portraying them as victims of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, ''Human Rights'' (2007), pp. 160–161. "Some critics argue that human rights organizations may tend to generate a narrative that reinforces images of helpless victims oppressed by an alien culture; in turn, this could be said to continue imperialism by other means."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
Particularly since the 1970s, the international human rights movement has been mediated by [[nongovernmental organization]]s (NGOs).&lt;ref name=TsutsuiWotipka/&gt;

Major international human rights organizations include [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref name="Neier2012-186"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neier2012-204"/&gt;

Historically, the influence of the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] is seen as highly important on the movement.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-7-9"/&gt;

The creation of the [[International Criminal Court]] at the turn of the 21st century is seen as another achievement of the international human rights activists.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-18"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3073">The '''International Bill of Human Rights''' was the name given to [http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/217%28III%29 UN General Assembly Resolution 217 (III)] and two international treaties established by the [[United Nations]]. It consists of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (adopted in 1948), the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR, 1966) with its two Optional Protocols and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR, 1966). The two covenants entered into force in 1976, after a sufficient number of countries had ratified them.

In the beginning, different views were expressed about the form the [[bill of rights]] should take. In 1948, General Assembly planned the bill to include UDHR, one Covenant and measures of implementation. The Drafting Committee decided to prepare two documents: one in the form of a declaration, which would set forth general principles or standards of human rights; the other in the form of a convention, which would define specific rights and their limitations. Accordingly, the Committee transmitted to the Commission on Human Rights draft articles of an international declaration and an international conventions on human rights. At its second session, in December 1947, the Commission decided to apply the term "International Bill of Human Rights" to the series of documents in preparation and established three working groups: one on the declaration, one on the convention (which it renamed "covenant") and one on implementation. The Commission revised the draft declaration at its third session, in May/June 1948, taking into consideration comments received from Governments. It did not have time, however, to consider the covenant or the question of implementation. The declaration was therefore submitted through the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], meeting in [[Paris]].

Later the draft covenant was divided in two (decided by the General Assembly in 1952&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/543(VI) UN GA resolution A/RES/543(VI)]&lt;/ref&gt;), differing with both catalogue of rights and degree of obligations – for example, the ICESCR refers to the "progressive realisation" of the rights it contains. In 1998 it was hailed as "A [[Magna Carta]] for all humanity".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/rights/50/carta.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The International Copyright Act of 1891''' ({{USStat|26|1106|26|1106}}, March 3, 1891) is the first [[U.S. Congress|U.S. congressional]] act that extended limited protection to foreign copyright holders from select nations.
Formally known as the "International Copyright Act of 1891", but more commonly referred to as the "Chace Act" after Sen. [[Jonathan Chace]] of [[Rhode Island]].

The International Copyright Act of 1891 was created because many people shunned the idea of literary piracy. It was the first U.S. congressional act that offered copyright protection in the United States to citizens of countries other than the United States. The act extended limited protection to foreign copyright holders from select nations. It was also important for American creators since they were more likely to have international copyright protection in countries that were offered the same protection by the United States. The Act empowered the President to extend copyright to works of foreign nationals.

The act was passed on March 3, 1891, by the [[Fifty-first United States Congress|51st Congress]]. The Act went into effect on July 1, 1891.  On July 3, 1891, the first foreign work, a play called ''Saints and Sinners'' by [[United Kingdom|British]] author [[Henry Arthur Jones]], was registered under the act.

== Background==

=== The protection of foreign works ===

During the time when the United States was just beginning to develop a literary tradition of its own, this nation refused to protect foreign works. As a result of this, American works were unprotected abroad and domestic publishers had to compete with each other for cheap editions of foreign works. Prior to the International Copyright Act, the first national copyright law was passed in 1790 and provided a copyright protection for 14 years, but only for authors who were citizens or residents of the United States. In order to get copyright protection in the rest of the world American authors were required to gain residency in the country in which they desired copyright protection. For example, Mark Twain obtained residency in Canada to protect his publication of ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]''.

To protect foreign literature in the United States, British authors would have an American citizen serve as a collaborator in the publishing process, and then have the book registered in Washington, D.C. under the collaborator's name. It was not until the 1830s that the pressure to extend American copyright to foreign authors first developed. Both American and British authors and publishers joined forces and pushed for a bilateral treaty between the United States and England. Famous authors such as Charles Dickens came to the United States to show their support for international copyright. Their biggest problem were American printers that already were protected by a high tariff on imported works, and who had no wish to pay royalties to English writers or publishers.

The United States discussed international copyright with Great Britain over the years. Congress requested correspondence to this effect in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Richardson |first=James D. |date=1897 |title=A compilation of the messages and papers of the presidents, 1789-1922 |url=http://archive.org/details/cu31924052157876 |publisher=Bureau of national literature and art |volume=5 |pages=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a proposed treaty in 1853 under [[Millard Fillmore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Richardson |first=James D. |date=1897 |title=A compilation of the messages and papers of the presidents, 1789-1922 |url=http://archive.org/details/cu31924092694847 |publisher=Bureau of national literature and art |volume=6 |pages=2725}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consideration of its ratification continued into an extension provided during [[Franklin Pierce]]'s presidency in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Richardson |first=James D. |date=1897 |title=A compilation of the messages and papers of the presidents, 1789-1922 |url=http://archive.org/details/cu31924092694854 |publisher=Bureau of national literature and art |volume=7 |pages=2764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, in the United States, only works published in the United States could be restricted with copyright. Authors including [[Mark Twain]], [[Louisa May Alcott]], [[Edward Eggleston]], and [[Edgar Wilson Nye|Bill Nye]] wrote letters in the mid-1880s to the ''Century'' requesting international copyright. These letters to the journals had a strong effect on this issue, as did the [[American Copyright League]] that was formed in 1883. The League was a great supporter of an International Copyright Act and, at the [[Madison Square Theater]] in 1885, the League sponsored readings by American authors in aid of the League's cause.

In 1885, [[United States Senator]] [[Joseph Roswell Hawley]] introduced a bill aimed at extending copyright to foreign authors for consideration by Congress.&lt;ref name="TwainCopyrightFight"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/newsletter/inventors-eye/mark-twains-copyright-fight |title=Mark Twain's Copyright Fight |last=Courtney |first=Steve |year=2017 |publisher=Inventor's Eye |language=en-US |access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chief difference between the Hawley Bill and the eventual Chase Bill was Hawley's removal of publisher and book-sellers' interests in the copyright process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Autobiography of Mark Twain |last=Twain |first=Mark |publisher=University of California Press |year=2015 |volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ultimately unsuccessful, though Mark Twain involved himself in the lobbying process and influenced President Grover Cleveland's thinking on the matter.&lt;ref name="TwainCopyrightFight"/&gt; Cleveland asked Congress for legislation to this effect in his State of the Union address that December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=Grover Cleveland's First State of the Union Address |wslink=Grover Cleveland's First State of the Union Address |last=Cleveland |first=Grover |authorlink=Grover Cleveland |year=1885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "National treatment" ===

While the United States was refusing any protection for foreign literary works, more and more countries in Europe started adapting the principle of "national treatment". This principle meant that each nation that signed the treaty was obligated to protect works produced by nationals of all other treaty members on the same terms that it protects its own nationals.

In 1884, academics, writers and diplomats met in Berne, Switzerland, to begin the work to form a multilateral copyright treaty. This was based on the principle of national treatment together with minimum standards so that a member country would be free to treat the copyrighted work of its own nationals however they chose to, but when it came to the works from other treaty members it would have to obey certain minimum standards. The treaty was signed in 1886 but the United States was not one of its founding members. American representatives had attended the Bern conference only as observers and it would take another 5 years until the United States took its first step to protect foreign works.

=== Effects of the Act===

==== "The manufacturing clause" ====

Ever since the first national copyright law in 1790, the United States had required certain "statutory formalities" to acquire copyright protection. These [[copyright formalities|formalities]] served as a test of an author's intention to claim protection for his or her work. The International Copyright Act of 1891 now applied these formalities to foreign publishers as well, but added an extra requirement called the "Manufacturing Clause".

The Manufacturing Clause required that all copies of foreign literary works should be printed from type set in the United States if they were to have American protection. This was an obvious concession to American printers, since they might otherwise have opposed the Act. When the International Copyright Act of 1891 was finally passed, foreign authors had to have their works in Washington, D.C. "on or before the day of publication in this or any foreign country." This too would create a problem, but by the early 1900s British authors were granted American Copyright since it was published abroad thirty days from its deposit in Washington, D.C. This would then allow American publishers time to release an authorized edition.

==== Provisions of the Act ====

The International Copyright Act of 1891 instituted important changes in copyright matters. One of the most extensive changes was that from the date the Act went into effect, all books were required to be manufactured in the United States in order to obtain American copyright. However, foreign authors had a better chance of protecting their works than before. This Act was the first step that the United States took towards an international copyright that could benefit foreign authors as well as domestic. Throughout time, the United States had been somewhat of a copyright outcast since they had not joined many international treaties or conventions. However, as the United States became a major exporter of copyrighted materials this changed. Even if there's still no such thing as an "international copyright" that will automatically protect an author's rights throughout the world, The International Copyright Act of 1891 was the first step to a number of international copyright treaties and conventions that the United States is now a part of (e.g. Berne Convention, Universal Copyright Convention, WIPO).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10154">The '''International Trade Organization''' ('''ITO''') was the proposed name for an [[International organization|international institution]] for the regulation of trade. 

Led by the [[United States]] in collaboration with allies, the effort to form the organization from 1945 to 1948, with the successful passing of the [[#Havana Charter|Havana Charter]], eventually failed due to lack of approval by the [[United States Congress|US Congress]]. Until the creation of the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1994, [[international trade]] was managed through the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT). 

==History==

===Proposal of an international trade institution===

The [[Bretton Woods Conference]] of 1944, which established an international institution for [[monetary policy]], recognized the need for a comparable international institution for trade to complement the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name="B79"&gt;P. van den Bossche, ''The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization'', 79&lt;/ref&gt; Bretton Woods was attended by representatives of finance ministries and not by representatives of trade ministries, the proposed reason why a trade agreement was not negotiated at that time.&lt;ref name="PM1"&gt;Palmeter-Mavroidis, ''Dispute Settlement''12345, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In early December 1945, the United States invited its war-time [[Allies of World War II|allies]] to enter into negotiations to conclude a multilateral agreement for the reciprocal reduction of [[Tariff|tariffs]] on trade in goods. In July 1945, the US Congress had granted President [[Harry S. Truman]] the authority to negotiate and conclude such an agreement. At the proposal of the United States, the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|United Nations Economic and Social Committee]] adopted a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]], in February 1946, calling for a conference to draft a charter for an International Trade Organization. 

A Preparatory Committee was established in February 1946, and met for the first time in London in October 1946 to work on the charter of an international organization for trade; the work was continued from April to November 1947.&lt;ref name="Irwin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Irwin|first=Douglas A.|title=The GATT's contribution to economic recovery in post-war Western Europe|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dirwin/GATT%20contribution.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-07-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910051604/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dirwin/GATT%20contribution.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ===
At the same time, the negotiations on the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in Geneva advanced well, and by October 1947 an agreement was reached: on October 30, 1947 eight of the twenty-three countries that had negotiated the GATT signed the "Protocol of Provisional Application of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade".&lt;ref&gt;The negotiating countries decided to bring the provisions of the GATT into force immediately. Nevertheless, they also feared that to spend the political effort required to get the GATT through the legislature might jeopardize the later effort to get the ITO passed. Therefore, they preferred to take the ITO Charter and the GATT to their legislatures as a package. To resolve this problem, eight of these countries signed the Protocol of Provisional Application of the General Agreement on Tariffs (PPA) (P. van den Bossche, ''The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization'', 80).&lt;/ref&gt; Those eight countries were the United States, the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Luxembourg]].

===Havana Charter===
In March 1948, the negotiations on the ITO Charter were successfully completed in Havana Charter. The Havana Charter (formally the "Final Act of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment") provided for the establishment of the ITO, and set out the basic rules for international trade and other international economic matters. It was signed by 56&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Irwin|first=Douglas A.|date=1993|title=The GATT's Contribution To Economic Recovery  In Post War Western Europe|url=|journal=Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve  System  International Finance  Discussion Papers  number 442,  March 1993|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; countries on March 24, 1948. It allowed for international cooperation and rules against anti-competitive business practices.

The Charter, proposed by [[John Maynard Keynes]], was to establish the ITO and a financial institution called the [[International Clearing Union]] (ICU), and an international [[currency]]; the [[bancor]]. The Havana Charter institutions were to stabilize trade by encouraging nations to "net zero", with [[trade surplus]] and [[trade deficit]] both discouraged. This [[negative feedback]] was to be accomplished by allowing nations [[overdraft]] equal to half the average value of the country's trade over the preceding five years, with [[interest]] charged on both surplus and deficit.

===Failure in United States Congress===
The Charter never came into force, in part because in 1950 the United States government announced that it would not submit the treaty to the [[United States Senate]] for [[ratification]]. While repeatedly submitted to the US Congress, the charter was never approved. The most usual argument against the new organization was that it would be involved into internal economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;P.B. Kenen, ''The International Economy'', I, 376&lt;/ref&gt; On December 6, 1950 President Truman announced that he would no longer seek Congressional approval of the ITO Charter.&lt;ref&gt;P. van den Bossche, ''The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization'', 80&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Palmeter-Mavroidis, ''Dispute Settlement'', 2&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the American rejection of the Charter, no other state ratified the treaty. Elements of the Charter would later become part of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT).

=== Individual trade agreements and World Trade Organization ===
In the absence of an international organization for trade, countries turned, from the early 1950s, to the only existing multilateral international institution for trade, the "GATT 1947", to handle problems concerning their trade relations. Therefore, the GATT would over the years "transform itself" into a ''[[de facto]]'' international organization. It was contemplated that the GATT would be applied for several years until the ITO came into force. However, since the ITO was never brought into being, the GATT gradually became the focus for international governmental cooperation on trade matters.&lt;ref name="BJ"&gt;P. van den Bossche, ''The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization'', 81&lt;br&gt;* J.H. Jackson, ''Managing the Trading System'', 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven rounds of negotiations occurred under GATT before the eighth round—the [[Uruguay Round]]—concluded in 1994 with the establishment of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) as the GATT's replacement. The GATT principles and agreements were adopted by the WTO, which was charged with administering and extending them.

The '''LaGuardia Committee''' was the first in-depth study into the effects of smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in the United States. An earlier study, the [[Indian Hemp Drugs Commission]], was conducted by the colonial authorities in [[British India]] in 1893-94. The reports systematically contradicted claims made by the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] that smoking marijuana results in insanity, deteriorates physical and mental health, assists in criminal behavior and [[juvenile delinquency]], is physically addictive, and is a "gateway" drug to more dangerous drugs.

The report was prepared by the [[New York Academy of Medicine]], on behalf of a commission appointed in 1939 by New York Mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]] who was a strong opponent of the [[1937 Marijuana Tax Act]]. Released in 1944, the report infuriated [[Harry Anslinger]], who was campaigning against marijuana. Anslinger condemned it as unscientific.&lt;ref name="druglibrary.net"&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/History/murd3.htm HARRY J. ANSLINGER: The Murderers THE STORY OF THE NARCOTIC GANGS, 1962]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anslinger went on an offensive against what he saw as a "degenerate [[Hollywood]]" that was promoting marijuana use. After high-profile arrests of actors like [[Robert Mitchum]], Hollywood gave Anslinger full control over the script of any film that mentioned marijuana.

==Sociological conclusions==
After more than five years of research the members of the committee drew up a catalog of 13 salient points with the conclusions they reached.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/Library/studies/lag/conc1.htm The LaGuardia Report - Conclusions]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Marijuana is used extensively in the Borough of Manhattan but the problem is not as acute as it is reported to be in other sections of the United States.
# The introduction of marijuana into this area is recent as compared to other localities.
# The cost of marijuana is low and therefore within the purchasing power of most persons.
# The distribution and use of marijuana is centered in Harlem.
# The majority of marijuana smokers are Blacks and Latin-Americans.
# The consensus among marijuana smokers is that the use of the drug creates a definite feeling of adequacy.
# The practice of smoking marijuana does not lead to [[addiction]] in the medical sense of the word.
# The sale and distribution of marijuana is not under the control of any single organized group.
# The use of marijuana does not lead to [[morphine]] or [[heroin]] or [[cocaine addiction]] and no effort is made to create a market for these narcotics by stimulating the practice of marijuana smoking.
# Marijuana is not the determining factor in the commission of major crimes.
# Marijuana smoking is not widespread among school children.
# Juvenile delinquency is not associated with the practice of smoking marijuana.
# The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of marijuana smoking in New York City is unfounded.

Therefore, according to the LaGuardia Report, the [[gateway drug theory]] is without foundation (points 7 and 9).

==Consequences==
Published in 1944, the report offended [[Harry Anslinger]], who branded it as "unscientific."&lt;ref name="druglibrary.net"/&gt; Harry Anslinger denounced Mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]], the [[New York Academy of Medicine]] and the doctors who had worked for more than five years on the research. Anslinger said that they should not conduct more experiments or studies on marijuana without his personal permission. Anslinger interrupted, between 1944 and 1945, each current research on derivatives of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], and according to some personally commissioned the [[American Medical Association]] to prepare a position which would reflect the one of the government.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Herer]]. 1985. ''[[The Emperor Wears No Clothes]]''. Ah Ha Publishing, Van Nuys, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The study conducted by AMA between 1944 and 1945 on Anslinger's personal request, having as objective to disprove the statements of the LaGuardia Report, leveraged again on [[racism]], asserting that "of the experimental group, thirty-four men were black, and only one was white", and "those who smoked marijuana, became disrespectful of white soldiers and officers during military segregation".&lt;ref&gt;"Army Study of Marijuana", ''Newsweek'', January 15, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

Only in 1972, the same institutional source that spread the series of scientifically unfounded rumors about the dangers of cannabis admitted that "these stories were largely false" and that "with careful consideration of the documentation there is no confirmation of the existence of a causal relationship between marijuana use and the possible use of heroin".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse]], "Marihuana. A signal of Misunderstanding"&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it was declared that the ban on cannabis was imposed and still subsisted "without any serious and comprehensive research had been conducted on the effects of marijuana".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

'''Land and Liberty''' ({{lang-es|"Tierra y Libertad"}}, {{lang-ru|Zemlya i Volya}}) is an [[anarchist]] slogan. It was originally used as a name of the Russian revolutionary organization [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Zemlya i Volya]] in 1878, then by the revolutionary leaders of the [[Mexican Revolution]]; the revolution was fought over land rights, and the leaders such as [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[Pancho Villa]] were fighting to give the land back to the natives from whom it was expropriated either by force or by some dubious manner. Without land, the peasants were at the mercy of landowners for subsistence.

Similarly, during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the main concern of the peasants was to free themselves from subservience to landowners, to get a plot of land if they had none, or to expand on their land holdings. Consequently, the Russian peasants welcomed the Russian Revolution under the banner "Zemlya i Volya": "Land and Liberty".

The slogan of "Tierra y Libertad" was also used during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] (1936–1939). In 1995, a film covering the [[Spanish Civil War]] was released with the title ''[[Land and Freedom]]''.

== Meaning ==

In a narrow sense, the possession of land meant freedom from the landowner. And this may have been the main concern of both the Mexican and Russian peasants.

In a broader sense, the slogan can be interpreted to mean that the necessary (though not the sufficient) condition of liberty is something like possession or access to subsistence land. If possession or access to land is a necessary condition of liberty, then its deprivation results in some form of slavery: [[tenancy]], [[sharecropping]], [[wage-slavery]]. Access to land is only a necessary condition because even with access, the government may impose taxes to such an extent that one is not free. For example, in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1932–1933, the government was removing from the peasants their agricultural products to the extant that it produced an artificial{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} famine which directly or indirectly killed roughly 2.582 million&lt;ref name="Vallin2"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Jacques Vallin |author2=France Mesle |author3=Serguei Adamets |author4=Serhii Pyrozhkov  | doi=10.1080/00324720215934 |title=A New Estimate of Ukrainian Population Losses during the Crises of the 1930s and 1940s |journal=[[Population Studies]] |volume=56 |issue=3 |date=November 2002 |pages=249–264 |jstor=3092980 |pmid=12553326}}&lt;/ref&gt; people only in [[Ukraine]]. (See [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]].) So, the possession of or access to subsistence land is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for liberty.

In the following passage, [[Friedrich Albert Lange]] points out the relation of the possession of land to liberty:
"In former times the marauding minority of mankind, by means of physical violence, compelled the working majority to render feudal services, or reduced them to a state of slavery or serfdom, or at least made them pay a tribute. Nowadays the dependence of the working classes is secured in a less direct but equally efficacious manner, viz. by means of the superior power of capital; the labourer being forced, in order to get his subsistence, to place his labour power entirely at the disposal of the capitalist. So there is a semblance of liberty; but in reality the labourer is exploited and subjected, because, all the land having been appropriated, he cannot procure his subsistence directly from nature, and, goods being produced for the market and not for the producer's own use, he cannot subsist without capital. Wages will rise above what is wanted for the necessaries of life, where the labourer is able to earn his subsistence on free land, which has not yet become private property. But wherever, in an old and totally occupied country, a body of labouring poor is employed in manufactures, the same law, which we see at work in the struggle for life throughout the organized world, will keep wages at the absolute minimum".&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Albert Lange]], ''Die Arbeiterfrage. Ihre Bedeutung für Gegenwart und Zukunft''. Vierte Auflage. 1861, pp.&amp;nbsp;12, 13. Quoted by H. J. Nieboer, [http://www.ditext.com/nieboer/title.html ''Slavery: As an Industrial System''] (Ethnological Researches), 2nd edition, 1909, p.&amp;nbsp;421.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appropriation as title ==
''Land and Liberty'' is the title of a publication produced in Britain by the supporters of the land value taxation programme described by Henry George in his book ''Progress and Poverty''. The journal was first published towards the end of the nineteenth century, originally under the name "Land Values". It was given its present title just before World War I. At present, the journal is quarterly. Articles are mostly about economics and political topics, with special reference to their relationship to land tenure and taxation.&lt;ref&gt;An almost-complete archive of Land Values and ''Land and Liberty'' is held at the library of [http://www.schooleconomicscience.org The School of Economic Science] in Mandeville Place, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

States specify their own official language(s) through legislation. The section of the Constitution of India dealing with official languages therefore includes detailed provisions which deal not just with the languages used for the official purposes of the union, but also with the languages that are to be used for the official purposes of each [[States and territories of India|state and union territory]] in the country, and the languages that are to be used for communication between the union and the states ''inter se''.

During the [[British Raj]], [[English language|English]] was used for purposes at the [[federalism|federal]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mollin|first=Sandra|title=Euro-English: assessing variety status|year=2006|publisher=Gunter Narr Verlag|isbn=978-3-8233-6250-0|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPhULmMmqJMC&amp;pg=PA17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian constitution adopted in 1950 envisaged that [[Hindi]] would be gradually phased in to replace English over a fifteen-year period, but gave [[Indian Parliament|Parliament]] the power to, by law, provide for the continued use of English even thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kanchan Chandra]], [http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/chandra/ps2001.pdf "Ethnic Bargains, Group Instability, and Social Choice Theory," Politics and Society 29, 3: 337-62.]&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to make Hindi the sole official language of the Republic met with [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|resistance]] in some parts of the country. Hindi continues to be used today, in combination with other (at the central level and in some states) State official languages at the state level.

The legal framework governing the use of languages for official purpose currently includes the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]], the Official Languages Act, 1963, Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) Rules, 1976, and various state [[law]]s, as well as [[Delegated legislation|rules and regulations]] made by the central government and the states.

The [[Constitution of India|Indian constitution]], in 1950, declared [[Hindi]] in [[Devanagari]] script to be the [[official language]] of the union. Unless Parliament decided otherwise, the use of [[English language|English]] for official purposes was to cease 15 years after the constitution came into effect, i.e., on 26 January 1965. The prospect of the changeover, however, led to much alarm in the non Hindi-speaking areas of India, especially [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]]-speaking states whose languages were not related to Hindi at all.

In late 1964, an attempt was made to expressly provide for an end to the use of [[English language|English]], but it was met with protests from states such as [[Maharashtra]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[West Bengal]], [[Karnataka]], [[Puducherry]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]]. Some of these protests also turned violent.&lt;ref&gt;Hardgrave, Robert L. (August 1965). "The Riots in Tamilnadu: Problems and Prospects of India's Language Crisis". Asian Survey (University of California Press)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the proposal was dropped,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940936,00.html|title=The force of words|accessdate=2007-06-05 | work=Time | date=1965-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Forrester |first=Duncan B. |title=The Madras Anti-Hindi Agitation, 1965: Political Protest and its Effects on Language Policy in India |journal=Pacific Affairs |volume=39 |issue=1/2 |pages=19–36 |date=Spring–Summer 1966 |doi=10.2307/2755179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Act itself was amended in 1967 to provide that the use of English would not be ended until a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] to that effect was passed by the legislature of every state that had not adopted Hindi as its official language, and by each house of the Indian Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 3(5) | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position was thus that the [[Government of India|Union government]] continues to use [[English language|English]] in addition to [[Hindi]] for its official purposes&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 3(1) | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a "subsidiary official language,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100502221154/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/preseng.htm Notification No. 2/8/60-O.L. (Ministry of Home Affairs), dated 27 April 1960]&lt;/ref&gt; but is also required to prepare and execute a [[Program (management)|programme]] to progressively increase its use of Hindi.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 1 | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact extent to which, and the areas in which, the Union government uses Hindi and English, respectively, is determined by the provisions of the Constitution, the Official Languages Act, 1963, the Official Languages Rules, 1976, and [[statutory instrument]]s made by the Department of Official Language under these laws.

=== Parliamentary proceedings and laws ===
The Indian constitution draws a distinction between the language to be used in [[Parliamentary procedure|Parliamentary proceedings]], and the language in which [[legislation|laws]] are to be made. Parliamentary business, according to the Constitution, may be conducted in either Hindi or English. The use of English in parliamentary proceedings was to be phased out at the end of fifteen years unless Parliament chose to extend its use, which Parliament did through the Official Languages Act, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 3(1b) | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the constitution permits a person who is unable to express themselves in either [[Hindi]] or [[English language|English]] to, with the permission of the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the relevant House, address the House in their [[mother tongue]].&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/p05120.html 120(1) first proviso].&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the constitution requires the authoritative text of all laws, including Parliamentary [[enactment (British legal term)|enactments]] and [[statutory instruments]], to be in English, until Parliament decides otherwise. Parliament has not exercised its power to so decide, instead merely requiring that all such laws and instruments, and all [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] brought before it, also be translated into Hindi, though the English text remains authoritative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 5(1,2) | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judiciary ===
The constitution provides, and the [[Supreme Court of India]] has reiterated, that all proceedings in the Supreme Court (the country's highest [[court]]) and the High Courts shall be in [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/court-language-is-english-says-supreme-court/articleshow/50080870.cms|title=Court language is English, says Supreme Court - The Economic Times|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament has the power to alter this by law, but has not done so. However, in many high courts, there is, with consent from the president, allowance of the optional use of Hindi. Such proposals have been successful in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar.&lt;ref&gt;{{url|http://www.business-standard.com/article/government-press-release/use-of-hindi-language-in-courts-116042801074_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administration ===
The Union government is required by law to progressively increase the use of Hindi in its official work,&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; which it has sought to do through "persuasion, incentive and goodwill".&lt;ref name=languages /&gt;

The Official Language Act provides that the Union government shall use both Hindi and English in most [[public administration|administrative]] documents that are intended for the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Section 3(3) | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}} names, amongst others, resolutions, general orders, rules, notifications, administrative or other [[report]]s or [[press release|press communiques]] issued by a [[government department]], [[government agency|agency]] or [[Public Sector Undertaking|corporation]]; administrative and other reports and official papers laid before a House or the Houses of Parliament; and [[contract]]s and agreements executed, and licences, permits, notices and forms of tender issued by or on behalf of the government (including government companies).&lt;/ref&gt; The Official Languages Rules, in contrast, provide for a higher degree of use of Hindi in communications between offices of the central government (other than offices in Tamil Nadu, to which the rules do not apply).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 1(ii) | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communications between different [[Ministry (government department)|departments]] within the central government may be in either Hindi or English, although a translation into the other language must be provided if required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 4(a) | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communications within offices of the same department, however, must be in Hindi if the offices are in Hindi-speaking states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 4(b, c) | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in either Hindi or English otherwise with Hindi being used in proportion to the percentage of staff in the receiving office who have a working knowledge of Hindi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 4(d) | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Note (typography)|Note]]s and [[memorandum|memos]] in files may be in either Hindi or English, with the Government having a duty to provide a translation into the other language if required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 8 | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, every person submitting a [[petition]] for the redress of a grievance to a government officer or authority has a [[constitutional right]] to submit it in any language used in India.

===Implementation===
Various steps have been taken by the Indian government to implement the use and familiarisation of Hindi extensively. [[Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha]] headquartered at [[Chennai]] was formed to spread Hindi in [[South India|South Indian states]]. Regional Hindi implementation offices at [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Guwahati]], [[Bhopal]], [[Delhi]] and [[Ghaziabad, India|Ghaziabad]] have been established to monitor the implementation of Hindi in Central government offices and PSUs.

Annual targets are set by the Department of Official Language regarding the amount of correspondence being carried out in Hindi. A Parliament Committee on Official Language constituted in 1976 periodically reviews the progress in the use of Hindi and submits a report to the President. The governmental body which makes policy decisions and established guidelines for promotion of Hindi is the ''Kendriya Hindi Samiti'' (est. 1967). In every city that has more than ten central Government offices, a Town Official Language Implementation Committee is established and cash awards are given to government employees who write books in Hindi. All Central government offices and PSUs are to establish Hindi Cells for implementation of Hindi in their offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Language - Constitutional/Statutory Provisions |url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/official_language.php |work=[[Government of India]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417150059/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/official_language.php |archivedate=17 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Modi government]] announced plans to promote Hindi in government offices in [[South India|Southern]] and [[Northeast India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/centre-to-promote-use-of-hindi-in-south-india-northeast-jitendra-singh/|title=Centre to promote use of Hindi in South India, Northeast:&lt;br/&gt;In response to this several NGO and political parties have started agitation and some have even re-sorted to violent protests in the Darjeeling for separate statehood, which started in after the official statement in press meet by Central parliamentary affairs minister. The monster himself hails from South India and many party leader of the government has felt as insult to the mother language. The TANA has stated "It's high time the North should learn the lessons from the past and should try not to stir the broth"&lt;br/&gt;The ADMK leader has said in New Delhi "It's a shame to see my neighbouring state leader hailing from Telugu state speaking against the his own mother tongue.&lt;br/&gt;The Dravida Samrakshana Samiti Head has said " it's a direct assault on our culture and is a insult for saying the minister hailing from South India. (Jitendra Singh)|date=2016-06-09|website=The Indian Express|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Govt-to-promote-use-of-Hindi-in-routine-conversation-NE/articleshow/52659063.cms|title=Govt to promote use of Hindi in routine conversation, NE - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian constitution does not specify the official languages to be used by the states for the conduct of their official functions, and leaves each state free to, through its legislature, adopt Hindi or any language used in its territory as its official language or languages.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of India, Article [http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/p17345.html 345]&lt;/ref&gt; The language need not be one of those listed in the [[Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India|Eighth Schedule]], and several states have adopted official languages which are not so listed. Examples include [[Kokborok]] in [[Tripura]] and [[Mizo language|Mizo]] in [[Mizoram]].

=== Legislature and administration ===
The constitutional provisions in relation to use of the official language in legislation at the [[States and union territories of India|State level]] largely mirror those relating to the official language at the central level, with minor variations. State legislatures may conduct their business in their [[official language]], Hindi or (for a transitional period, which the legislature can extend if it so chooses) English, and members who cannot use any of these have the same rights to their [[mother tongue]] with the Speaker's permission. The authoritative text of all laws must be in English, unless Parliament passes a law permitting a state to use another language, and if the original text of a law is in a different language, an authoritative English translation of all laws must be prepared.

The state has the right to regulate the use of its official language in [[public administration]], and in general, neither the constitution nor any central enactment imposes any restriction on this right. However, every person submitting a [[petition]] for the redress of a grievance to an officer or authority of the state government has a constitutional right to submit it in any language used in that state, regardless of its official status.

In addition, the constitution grants the central government, acting through the [[President of India|President]], the power to issue certain directives to the government of a state in relation to the use of [[minority language]]s for official purposes. The President may direct a State to officially recognise a language spoken in its territory for specified purposes and in specified regions, if its speakers demand it and satisfy him that a substantial proportion of the State's population desire its use. Similarly, States and local authorities are required to endeavour to provide [[primary education]] in the mother tongue for all [[linguistic minority|linguistic minorities]], regardless of whether their language is official in that State, and the President has the power to issue directions he deems necessary to ensure that they are provided these facilities.

=== State judiciary ===
States have significantly less freedom in relation to determine the language in which judicial proceedings in their respective [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] will be conducted. The constitution gives the power to authorise the use of Hindi, or the state's official language in proceedings of the High Court to the [[Governors and Lieutenant-Governors of states of India|Governor]], rather than the state legislature, and requires the Governor to obtain the consent of the [[President of India]], who in these matters acts on the advice of the [[Government of India]]. The Official Languages Act gives the Governor a similar power, subject to similar conditions, in relation to the language in which the High Court's judgments will be delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Section 7 | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four states—[[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Rajasthan]]—&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barandbench.com/index.php?title=Language%20in%20Courts%20-%20a%20bridge%20or%20a%20barrier?&amp;page=brief&amp;id=805&amp;gn=0 Language in Courts - a bridge or a barrier?]&lt;/ref&gt; have been granted the right to conduct proceedings in their High Courts in their official language, which, for all of them, was Hindi. However, the only non-Hindi state to seek a similar power—[[Tamil Nadu]], which sought the right to conduct proceedings in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] in its [[Madras High Court|High Court]]—had its application rejected by the central government earlier, which said it was advised to do so by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Special Correspondent |title=Karunanidhi stands firm on Tamil in High Court | newspaper = The Hindu |page=1 |date=12 March 2007 |url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/03/12/stories/2007031205180100.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the law ministry said that it would not object to Tamil Nadu state's desire to conduct [[Madras High Court]] proceedings in [[Tamil language|Tamil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2006/12/03/stories/2006120306220800.htm The Hindu: Tamil Nadu / Thanjavur News: No objection to Tamil as court language: A.P.

{{main|Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India}}
The Eighth Schedule to the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]] contains a list of 22 scheduled languages. At the time the constitution was enacted, inclusion in this list meant that the language was entitled to representation on the [[Official Languages Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of India, Article [http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/p17344.html 344(1)].&lt;/ref&gt; and that the language would be one of the bases that would be drawn upon to enrich Hindi, the official language of the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of India, Article [http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/p17351.html 351].&lt;/ref&gt; The list has since, however, acquired further significance. The Government of India is now under an obligation to take measures for the development of these languages, such that "they grow rapidly in richness and become effective means of communicating modern knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 2 | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a candidate appearing in an examination conducted for public service at a higher level is entitled to use any of these languages as the medium in which he or she answers the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 4 | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Via the 92nd Constitutional amendment 2003, four new languages&amp;nbsp;– [[Dogri]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Santali language|Santali]] and [[Bodo language|Bodo]]&amp;nbsp;– were added to the 8th Schedule of the Indian Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india.gov.in/govt/constitutions_india_bak.php#amd National Portal of India: Government: Constitution of India&lt;!-- Bot-generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331194710/http://india.gov.in/govt/constitutions_india_bak.php|date=31 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The table below lists the 22 languages set out in the Eighth Schedule as of May 2008, together with the regions where they are used.

Even though the English language is not included in the Eighth Schedule (as it is a foreign language), it is one of the official languages of the Union of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf Constitution of India] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909000000/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |date=9 September 2014}}, page 330, EIGHTH SCHEDULE, Articles 344 (1) and 351].

== Union–state and interstate communication ==
The language in which communications between different states, or from the union government to a state or a person in a state, shall be sent is regulated by the Official Languages Act and, for states other than [[Tamil Nadu]], by the Official Languages Rules. Communication between states who use Hindi as their official language is required to be in Hindi, whereas communication between a state whose official language is Hindi and one whose is not, is required to be in English, or, in Hindi with an accompanying English translation (unless the receiving state agrees to dispense with the translation).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Communication between the union and states which use Hindi as their official language (classified by the Official Language Rules as "the states in Region A"), and with persons who live in those states, is generally in Hindi, except in certain cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 3(1) | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication with a second category of states "Region B", which do not use Hindi as their official language but have elected to communicate with the union in Hindi (currently [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], and [[Punjab, India|Punjab]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 2(g) | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is usually in Hindi, whilst communications sent to an individual in those states may be in either Hindi or English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 3(2) | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication with all other states "Region C", and with people living in them, is in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) - Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) - Paragraph 3(3) | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2013''' ({{USBill|113|hr|2655}}) is a bill that would amend Rule 11 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] to require courts to impose appropriate [[Sanctions (law)|sanctions]] on attorneys, law firms, or parties who file [[Frivolous litigation|frivolous lawsuits]] and to require them to compensate parties injured by such conduct.&lt;ref name="cbo2655"/&gt; The compensation would cover the attorney fees and other lawsuit-related costs that the defendant in the frivolous lawsuit had to pay.&lt;ref name=houselimitsPete&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House GOP looking to limit asbestos actions, frivolous lawsuits|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/legislative-debate/189303-house-gop-looking-to-limit-asbestos-actions-frivolous|accessdate=13 November 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would also remove the provision of Rule 11 allowing attorneys or parties who file frivolous papers to avoid party-requested sanctions by withdrawing their lawsuits before 21 days have passed.&lt;ref name="houselimitsPete"/&gt; The bill was introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]]. On November 14, 2013 the bill passed the House, but was never passed by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2655&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=2655sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2655 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/2655|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2013 would amend the sanctions provisions in Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to require the court to impose an appropriate sanction on any attorney, law firm, or party that has violated, or is responsible for the violation of, the rule with regard to representations to the court. The bill would require any sanction to compensate parties injured by the conduct in question.&lt;ref name="2655sum"/&gt;

The bill removes a provision that prohibits filing a motion for sanctions if the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial is withdrawn or appropriately corrected within 21 days after service or within another time the court sets.&lt;ref name="2655sum"/&gt;

The bill also authorizes the court to impose additional sanctions, including striking the pleadings, dismissing the suit, nonmonetary directives, or penalty payments if warranted for effective deterrence.&lt;ref name="2655sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on September 11, 2013. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo2655&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 2655|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44614|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H.R. 2655 would amend Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to require courts to impose appropriate sanctions on attorneys, law firms, or parties who file frivolous lawsuits and to require them to compensate parties injured by such conduct.&lt;ref name="cbo2655"/&gt; Under current law, courts may, but are not required to, impose such sanctions.

Under the legislation, any monetary sanction imposed under Rule 11 would be paid by the parties to the suit. Thus, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing the bill would result in no significant impact on the federal budget.&lt;ref name="cbo2655"/&gt; Enacting H.R. 2655 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.&lt;ref name="cbo2655"/&gt;

H.R. 2655 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded mandate#Unfunded Mandates Reform Act|Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.&lt;ref name="cbo2655"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2013 was introduced on July 11, 2013 by [[Lamar S. Smith|Rep. Lamar Smith (R, TX-21)]].&lt;ref name=2655allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2655 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2655/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]] and the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice]].  The House Judiciary committee voted to report the bill on September 11, 2013 by a vote of 17-10.&lt;ref name="2655allactions"/&gt;  [http://beta.congress.gov/113/crpt/hrpt255/CRPT-113hrpt255.pdf House Report 113-255] was released to accompany the bill on October 30, 2013.&lt;ref name="2655allactions"/&gt; On November 8, 2013, House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] announced that the bill would be considered during the week of November 11, 2013.&lt;ref name=majorityleader1&gt;{{cite web|title=Leader's Weekly Schedule - Week of November 11, 2013 |url=http://majorityleader.gov/floor/11-11-13.pdf |publisher=House Majority Leader's Office |accessdate=11 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224006/http://majorityleader.gov/floor/11-11-13.pdf |archivedate= 2 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The House was scheduled to work on this bill on November 14, 2013.&lt;ref name=closerlookPete&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=A closer look at next week|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/189742-a-closer-look-at-next-week%E2%80%A6-like-it-keep-it-sorry-tweak-it|accessdate=13 November 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
Rep. Lamar Smith argued in favor of the bill and getting rid of the 21-day safe-harbor provision, stating that it would help end lawyers filing frivolous lawsuits when they have "everything to gain and nothing to lose" by doing so.&lt;ref name="houselimitsPete"/&gt; Smith also said that "Lawyers can file meritless lawsuits, and defendants are faced with the choice of years of litigation, high court costs and attorneys' fees or a settlement," and called the practice "legalized extortion."&lt;ref name="houselimitsPete"/&gt;

Republicans argue in favor of the bill as being needed to help protect companies from expensive and wasteful lawsuits. Democrats argued that the bill is unnecessary since judges already have the option of impossing sanctions.&lt;ref name=houseadvancesbills&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House advances bills on asbestos transparency, frivolous lawsuits|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/votes/190140-house-advances-bills-on-asbestos-transparency-frivolous-lawsuits|accessdate=13 November 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3962">'''Live 4 X''' is an online charitable event series launched in 2010 by Grammy winning recording artist [[Imogen Heap]] and social media philanthropist and urban entrepreneur [[Thomas Ermacora]]. Initially inspired by the [[2010 Pakistan floods]], each individual event is organized as a charitable initiative in response to catastrophic situation or event, such as a natural disaster, that has incurred vast devastation and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/31/richard-branson-imogen-heap-pakistan-benefit_n_699747.html] Huffington Post article, ''Richard Branson, Imogen Heap Team Up For Online Pakistan Relief Fundraiser''&lt;/ref&gt;

By integrating education, entertainment, and modern technology, ''Live 4 X'' events stream online in real time, with the goal of educating viewers regarding their respective charitable initiative, providing complimentary entertainment in exchange for donations to a relevant organization, and crowd-sourcing sustainable design ideas that may later be implemented in recovery efforts. Past non-profit beneficiaries have included The [[Red Cross]], [[UNICEF]], and [[Architecture for Humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/business-being-diva/2011/may/20/imogen-heap-throws-japan-tsunami-victims-lifeline/] Washington Times Communities article, ''Imogen Heap throws Japan tsunami victims a Lifeline''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virginunite.com/partner/USA/Live-4-Sendai---5pm-EDT---April-11th/] Virgin Unite's Live 4 Sendai announcement&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/sendai-calling-social-media-real-life-125983] Architecture for Humanity founder Cameron Sinclair reacts to the news of the March 2011 Japan tsunami in Adweek Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] Heap stated, “I wanted to do something, but what can you?  I mean, you can give money, but it doesn’t seem like enough.  Music is the thing that we do, and I wanted in some way to connect that to these events.” &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcrvGdsGq08] Imogen Heap's May 2011 interview with Jennifer Grassman regarding Japan tsunami recovery and Live 4 Sendai&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Live 4 X'' event series is a project under the umbrella of [[Bubbletank]], an experimental, collaborative enterprise, launched by Heap and Ermacora in 2010, and geared toward leveraging the power of social media to facilitate charitable efforts toward proactive change through the mediums of music, cyber technology, design, and film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebubbletank.org/] Bubbletank&lt;/ref&gt;

==A catalog of ''Live 4 X'' events==
* August 31, 2010 – ''Live 4 Pakistan'' raised funds for flood relief and recovery in that region. Musicians included [[Ben Folds]], [[Amanda Palmer]], [[Kate Havnevik]], [[KT Tunstall]], [[Josh Groban]], and [[Zoe Keating]].

* April 11, 2011 – ''Live 4 Sendai'' raised funds for Japanese tsunami recovery following the disastrous [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Great East Japan earthquake]] of 2011. The event was also used to solicit rebuilding design ideas on behalf of [[Architecture for Humanity]]. Performers included [[Amanda Palmer]], [[Ben Folds]], [[KT Tunstall]] and [[Jamie Cullum]] and hosted by [[Ze Frank]].

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;In [[North America]]n [[broadcasting]], a '''local marketing agreement''' (or '''local management agreement''', abbreviated as an '''LMA''') is a [[contract]] in which one [[corporation|company]] agrees to operate a [[radio station|radio]] or [[television station]] owned by another party. In essence, it is a sort of [[lease]] or [[time-buy]].&lt;/P?

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;Under [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations, a local marketing agreement must give the company operating the station (the "senior" partner) under the agreemen&lt;t control over the entire facilities of the station, including the finances, personnel and programming of the station. Its original  [[license]]e (the "junior" partner) still remains legally responsible for the station and its operations, such as compliance with relevant regulations regarding content. Occasionally, a "local marketing agreement" may refer to the sharing or contracting of only certain functions, in particular advertising sales. This may also be referred to as a '''time brokerage agreement''' ('''TBA'''), '''local sales agreement''' ('''LSA'''), '''management services agreement''' ('''MSA'''), or most commonly, a '''joint sales agreement''' ('''JSA''') or '''shared services agreement''' ('''SSA'''). JSAs are counted toward ownership caps for television and radio stations.&lt;ref name="radioink-jsaradio"&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC Denies Waiver Bid, Rules Nassau Must End JSA|url=http://www.radioink.com/HeadlineEntry.asp?hid=143148&amp;pt=todaysnews|work=[[Radio Ink]]|publisher=MediaSpan Group|date=August 12, 2008|accessdate=December 27, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228022757/http://www.radioink.com/HeadlineEntry.asp?hid=143148&amp;pt=todaysnews|archivedate=December 28, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TVNC-kibosh/&gt; In Canada, local marketing agreements between domestic stations require the consent of the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), although [[Rogers Media]] has used a similar arrangement to control a U.S.-based radio station in a border [[media market|market]].&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;The increased use of sharing agreements by media companies to form [[Media consolidation|consolidated]], "virtual" [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|duopolies]] became controversial between 2009 and 2014, especially arrangements where a company buys a television station's facilities and assets, but sells the license to an affiliated third-party "shell" corporation, who then enters into agreements with the owner of the facilities to operate the station on their behalf. Activists have argued that broadcasters were using these agreements as a [[loophole]] for the FCC's ownership regulations, that they reduce the number of local media outlets in a [[media market|market]] through the aggregation or outright consolidation of news programming, and allow station owners to have increased leverage in the negotiation of [[retransmission consent]] with local [[multichannel video programming distributor|subscription television providers]]. Station owners have contended that these sharing agreements allow streamlined, cost-effective operations that may be beneficial to the continued operation of lower-rated and/or financially weaker stations, especially in smaller markets.&lt;ref name=tvnc-jointretrans/&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;In 2014 under chairman [[Tom Wheeler (FCC)|Tom Wheeler]], the FCC began to increase its scrutiny regarding the use of such agreements—particularly joint sales—to evade its policies. On March 31, 2014, the commission voted to make joint sales agreements count as ownership if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time for its partner, and to ban coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the top four stations in a market. Wheeler indicated that he planned to address local marketing and shared services agreements in the future. The change in stance also prompted changes to then-proposed acquisitions by [[Gray Television]] and [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], who, rather than use sharing agreements to control them, moved their existing programming and network affiliations to [[digital subchannel]]s of existing company-owned stations in the market, or a [[low-power broadcasting|low-power station]] (which are not subject to ownership caps), and then relinquished control over the original stations by selling their licenses to third-parties, such as minority-owned broadcasters.&lt;/P&gt;

==History and background==
&lt;P align="justify"&gt;Due to the FCC's limits on station ownership at the time (which prevented the common ownership of multiple radio stations), local marketing agreements in radio, in which a smaller station would sell its entire airtime to a third-party in time-buy, were widespread between the 1970s and early 1990s.&lt;ref name=concise-encyclopedia/&gt; These alliances gave larger broadcasters a way to expand their reach, and smaller broadcasters a means of obtaining a stable stream of revenue.&lt;ref name=concise-encyclopedia/&gt; In 1992, the FCC began allowing broadcasting companies to own multiple radio stations in a single market. Following these changes, local marketing agreements largely fell out of favor for radio, as it was now possible for broadcasters to simply buy another station outright rather than lease it – consequentially triggering a wave of mass consolidation in the radio industry.&lt;ref name=concise-encyclopedia/&gt; However, broadcasters still used local marketing agreements to help transition acquired stations to their new owners.&lt;ref name=concise-encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of American radio|author=Christopher H.

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;The first local marketing agreement in [[North America]]n television was formed in 1991, when the Sinclair Broadcast Group purchased [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WPGH-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania. As Sinclair had already owned [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] WPTT (now [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[WPNT]]) in that market, which would have violated FCC rules which at the time had prohibited television station duopolies, Sinclair decided to sell the lower-rated WPTT to the station's manager Eddie Edwards, but continued to operate the station through an LMA (Sinclair eventually repurchased the station – then assigned the call letters WCWB – outright in 2000, after the Federal Communications Commission began permitting common ownership of two television stations in the same market, creating a legal duopoly).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fighting for Air: The Battle to Control America's Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dR4xhtp0l2MC&amp;pg=PA102|author=[[Eric Klinenberg]]|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|date=January 9, 2007|pages=101–105|isbn=9781429923606}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;Sinclair's use of local marketing agreements would lead to legal issues in 1999, when Glencairn, Ltd. (since restructured as [[Cunningham Broadcasting]]) announced that it would acquire Fox affiliate [[KOKH-TV]] in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]] from Sullivan Broadcasting; Glencairn subsequently announced plans to sell five of its 11 existing stations that were operated by Sinclair under LMAs to that company outright. As the family of Sinclair Broadcast Group founder Julian Smith controlled 97% of Glencairn's stock assets (which remains the case under its Cunningham structure) and the company was to be paid with Sinclair stock in turn for the purchases, KOKH and Sinclair-owned [[The WB|WB]] affiliate [[KOCB]] (now a [[The CW|CW]] affiliate) would effectively constitute a [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] in violation of FCC rules. The [[Rainbow/PUSH]] coalition (headed by [[Jesse Jackson]]) filed challenges against the sale with the FCC, citing concerns over a single company holding two broadcast licenses in a single market and argued that Glencairn was masquerading as a separate minority-owned company (Edwards, who served as Glencairn's president, is [[African American]]) when it was really an arm of Sinclair that the company used to gain control of the stations through LMAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PUSH pushing FCC over Sinclair/Glencairn|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20938729.html|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|publisher=HighBeam Research|date=July 13, 1998|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Glencairn's dicey LMAs|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54266781.html|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=HighBeam Research|date=March 29, 1999|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the FCC updated its media ownership rules to allow a single company to own two television stations in the same market in August 1999, Sinclair restructured the deal to acquire KOKH outright. In 2001, the FCC issued a $40,000 fine against Sinclair for illegally controlling Glencairn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC fines Sinclair for Glencairn control|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/fcc-fines-sinclair-glencairn-control/90604|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=December 10, 2001|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;In 1999, the FCC modified its media ownership rules to count LMAs formed after November 5, 1996 that cover more than 15% of the broadcast day toward the ownership limits for the brokering station's owner.&lt;ref name="fcc-sinclairallbrittonlmas"&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Shared Services Agreements: Danger Ahead!|url=http://www.commlawblog.com/tags/local-marketing-agreement/|author=Steve Lovelady|work=CommLawBlog|publisher=Fletcher, Heald &amp; Hildreth PLC|date=November 27, 2011|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even still, the related joint sales and shared services agreement structures became increasingly common during the 2000s; these outsourcing agreements proliferated between 2011 and 2013, when station owners such as Sinclair and the [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting Group]] began expanding their portfolios by acquiring additional stations in an effort to drive [[Sliding scale fees|scale]] as well as to gain leverage in retransmission consent negotiations with [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television]] providers.&lt;/P&gt;

==Uses==
===Consolidation===
&lt;P align="justify"&gt;The most common use of an LMA in television broadcasting is to create a "virtual duopoly", where the stations operated under the agreement are consolidated into a single entity. The operations of the stations can be streamlined for cost-effectiveness through the sharing of resources, such as facilities, advertising sales, personnel and programming.&lt;ref name=tvnc-fire/&gt; Many broadcasters that engage in the practice believe that such agreements are beneficial to the survival of television stations – especially in smaller markets, where the overall audience reach is considerably less than that of markets that are centered upon densely populated [[metropolitan area]]s, and the cost savings achieved through the consolidation of resources and staff may be necessary to fund a station's continued operation.&lt;ref name=tvnc-fire/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-change"/&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;Sharing agreements may also be used as a loophole to control television stations in situations where it is legally impossible to own them outright. For instance, FCC regulations only allowed a single company to own more than one full-powered television station in a given market if there are at least eight distinct station owners, and also prohibits the ownership of two or more of the four highest-rated stations (based on total day viewership) in a market. An LMA or similar agreement does not affect the ownership of the station's license, meaning that they do not require the approval of the FCC to establish, and the two stations are still legally considered separate operations from a licensing standpoint.&lt;ref name="nyt-change"/&gt; Both [[Tribune Media]] and the [[Gannett Company]] were required to use shared services agreements as a similar loophole to take control of certain stations in their respective 2013 purchases of [[Local TV LLC|Local TV]] and [[Belo]], as they did not have exemptions to the FCC's [[Media cross-ownership in the United States|newspaper cross-ownership restrictions]] in the affected markets.&lt;ref name="adweek-gannett"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Public Interest Groups, Cable Companies Oppose Gannett-Belo Merger|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/public-interest-groups-cable-companies-oppose-gannett-belo-merger-151425|author=Katy Bachman|work=[[Adweek]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dp-saletotribune"&gt;{{cite news|title=''Daily Press'' owner Tribune Co. to buy 19 TV stations, including WTKR |url=http://www.dailypress.com/business/tidewater/dp-nws-tribune-daily-press-buys-wtkr-20130701,0,6214410.story |author=Sarah J.

[[Tegna, Inc.|Tegna]], who holds the former Gannett's broadcasting and digital media properties, re-acquired the licenses for most of the affected stations following the split.&lt;ref name=fcc-saletotegnacomplete/&gt;&lt;ref name="usat-tegna"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gannett to change name to TEGNA amid print unit spinoff|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/04/21/gannett-changes-name-to-tegna/26127343/|author=Roger Yu|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=April 21, 2015|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usat-tegna"/&gt; On November 16, 2017 under the [[Trump administration]], the FCC voted in favor of removing the requirement for a market to still have eight distinct station owners in order to allow duopolies, but the prohibition of owning two of the top four stations in a market remains.&lt;ref name="bc-deregulate"/&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;Broadcasters could also collect carriage fees for the stations they operate under sharing agreements on behalf of their owner, often bundling its carriage agreements with those of stations they own outright. This could, especially in LMAs between two stations affiliated with the "major" networks, allow the broadcaster to charge higher fees for [[retransmission consent]] to television providers for carrying the stations, which could result in smaller cable companies not being able to afford the higher fees imposed. Cable television providers advocated barring sharing agreements between television stations for this particular reason. In the United States, the FCC no longer allows broadcasters to collude with one another in negotiating retransmission consent fees.&lt;ref name=tvnc-jointretrans/&gt;&lt;ref name=tvnc-fire/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-change"/&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

===Operation on behalf of a third-party owner===
&lt;P align="justify"&gt;Although the majority of LMAs involve the outsourcing of one television station's operations to another, occasionally, a company may operate a station under an LMA, JSA or SSA even if it does not already own a station in that market. One example occurred in December 2013, when the Louisiana Media Company (owned by [[New Orleans Saints]] and [[New Orleans Hornets]] owner [[Tom Benson]]) entered into a shared services agreement with [[Raycom Media]] to run the former company's [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], [[WVUE-DT]]; while Louisiana Media Company retained the station's ownership and license, other assets were assumed by Raycom, which owns stations in markets adjacent to New Orleans (including [[WAFB|Baton Rouge]], [[WLBT|Jackson]], [[WLOX-TV|Biloxi]], [[KPLC|Lake Charles]] and [[KSLA-TV|Shreveport]]) but not within New Orleans itself. Benson had received offers from Raycom and others to buy the station, but was not prepared to sell WVUE outright.&lt;ref name="nola-vueraycom"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harry Connick Jr. may be a player in the 10 p.m. race between WWL, WVUE – both under new management|url=http://www.nola.com/tv/index.ssf/2014/01/harry_connick_jr_may_be_a_majo.html#incart_river|author=Dave Walker|work=NOLA.com (''[[The Times-Picayune]]'')|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|date=January 15, 2014|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nola-raycomssa"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/tv/index.ssf/2013/11/wvue_enters_into_shared-servic.html|title=WVUE enters into shared-services agreement with Raycom Media|author=Dave Walker|work=NOLA.com (''The Times-Picayune'')|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|date=November 20, 2013|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 4, 2017, Raycom acquired the station for $51.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raycom Buys WVUE New Orleans For $51.8M|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/102939/raycom-buys-wvue-new-orleans-for-518m|author=Harry A.

===Foreign control of broadcast outlets===
{{See also|Border blaster}}
&lt;P align="justify"&gt;LMAs can also allow companies to control foreign stations from outside of their respective country; Canadian media company [[Rogers Media]] uses a joint sales agreement to operate [[Cape Vincent, New York|Cape Vincent]], [[New York (state)|New York]] radio station [[WLYK]] as a station targeting the nearby Canadian market of [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Ontario]], where it owns [[CKXC-FM]] and [[CIKR-FM]]. Rogers owns a 47% stake in WLYK's licensee, Border International Broadcasting.&lt;ref name="fcc-rogerswlyk"&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC 323 (Ownership Report for Commercial Broadcast Stations)|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1443431&amp;Service=FM&amp;Form_id=322&amp;Facility_id=8567|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=March 2013|accessdate=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rinsight-wlyk"&gt;{{cite web|title=WLYK Relaunches as Adult Contemporary|url=http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/70427/wlyk-relaunches-as-adult-contemporary/|author=Lance Venta|publisher=RadioBB Networks|work=RadioInsight|date=September 9, 2012|accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

==Effects of LMAs==
[[File:WBFF and WNUV's combined studio and office facility (Baltimore, 2007).jpg|thumb|
The studio facilities shared by [[WBFF]] and [[WNUV]] in [[Baltimore]]; WBFF owner Sinclair Broadcast Group operates WNUV, which is owned by [[Cunningham Broadcasting]].]]  &lt;P align="justify"&gt;Public interest organizations have disapproved of the use of LMAs for virtual duopolies that circumvent the FCC's rules due to their effects on the broadcasting industry, particularly the results of consolidation through the irregular use of LMAs.&lt;ref name=tvnc-fire/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-change"/&gt; In markets where duopolies are not legally possible, a company may elect to form one by purchasing a station's "non-license" assets (such as their physical facilities, programming rights, and other [[intellectual property]]), and selling the license itself to a third-party "sidecar" company (which is often affiliated with the purchaser), which in turn, enters into an LMA or a similar agreement with the senior partner. The FCC only recognizes ownership of television stations by the ownership of their license and [[facility ID]], and not by the ownership of these "non-license" assets; this means that the senior partner becomes the ''de facto'' owner and operator of the station, but the sidecar is still the legal owner.&lt;ref name=tvnc-fire/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt-change/&gt;&lt;ref name="hsb-tvswap"&gt;{{cite news|title=Execs explain TV swap, but some see it as blurry|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/content/20090820_Execs_explain_TV_swap_but_some_see_it_as_blurry|author=Erika Engle|work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|publisher=Oahu Publications|date=August 20, 2009|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the FCC determines a sidecar firm to be an independent entity from the company using it to outsource station operations for licensing purposes, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] does not make such a designation, requiring reports on sidecars to be included in a broadcaster's financial statements.&lt;ref name="fcc-sidecarexplanation"&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Sidecar Business Model Works|url=http://www.fcc.gov/blog/how-sidecar-business-model-works|author=Phil Verveer|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=March 6, 2014|accessdate=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kmov-sidecar"&gt;{{cite news|title=KMOV ruling may slow use of TV station 'sidecar' deals|url=http://www.stltoday.com/business/columns/david-nicklaus/kmov-ruling-may-slow-use-of-tv-station-sidecar-deals/article_3ddd81f0-bf15-58dd-98ee-efe60ead6b24.html|author=David Nicklaus|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;Both Sinclair and Nexstar became infamous for their frequent use of sidecars as part of their expansion and consolidation tactics, partnering with companies like Cunningham Broadcasting, [[Deerfield Media]], [[Mission Broadcasting]], and even each other in the case of a virtual duopoly in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], [[Pennsylvania]] between Sinclair-owned CBS affiliate [[WHP-TV]] and Nexstar-owned CW affiliate [[WXBU|WLYH-TV]], and a former virtual duopoly in [[Rochester, New York]] between Nexstar-owned CBS affiliate [[WROC-TV]] and Sinclair-owned Fox affiliate [[WUHF]] (in the wake of Sinclair and Deerfield's purchase of ABC affiliate [[WHAM-TV]], this particular arrangement ended in January 2014).&lt;ref name="tvnc-fire"&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual Duopolies Coming Under Fire|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/42842/virtual-duopolies-coming-under-fire|author=Kim McAvoy|work=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|pages=1–2|date=June 9, 2010|accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-change"&gt;{{cite news|title=You Can Change the Channel, but Local News Is the Same|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/business/media/local-tv-stations-cut-costs-by-sharing-news-operations.html|author=Brian Stelter|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=A1|date=May 28, 2012|accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dandc-wrocwuhf"&gt;{{cite news|title=WROC out, 13WHAM in on Fox|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/money/business/2013/10/07/wroc-out-13wham-in-on-fox/2939773|author=Matthew Daneman|work=[[Democrat and Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

While not to the same, wide extent as Sinclair and Nexstar, some broadcasters have similar business relationships with specific sidecar companies as partners for these agreements:
*&lt;P align="justify"&gt;[[Raycom Media]] has a similar business relationship with [[American Spirit Media]] in markets such as [[Toledo, Ohio]] (where American Spirit Media purchased Fox affiliate [[WUPW]] from [[LIN Media]] in 2012, with that station's operations being taken over by CBS affiliate [[WTOL]]),&lt;ref name="tvbr-wupwwtolssa"&gt;{{cite web|title=LIN spins Toledo TV to Raycom partner|url=http://www.rbr.com/tv-cable/tv_deals/lin-spins-toledo-tv-to-raycom-partner.html|work=Radio &amp; Television Business Report|publisher=Streamline RBR|date=January 11, 2012|accessdate=January 12, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117052532/http://www.rbr.com/tv-cable/tv_deals/lin-spins-toledo-tv-to-raycom-partner.html|archivedate=January 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, two Raycom-owned Fox stations, [[WFLX]] in [[West Palm Beach]] and [[KNIN-TV]] in [[Boise]], are managed by [[E.W.

* [[Gray Television]] is affiliated with the sidecar Excalibur Broadcasting – owned by former Gray executive Don Ray,&lt;ref name=KJCTsale/&gt; 
* &lt;P align="justify"&gt;[[Granite Broadcasting]] operated virtual duopolies in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]] and [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], [[Minnesota]] with the sidecar [[Malara Broadcast Group]]. The stations have since been respectively sold to [[Quincy Media|Quincy Newspapers]] and [[SagamoreHill Broadcasting]], with Quincy temporarily operating SagamoreHill's stations under an SSA – although in Fort Wayne, Quincy acquired the previous junior partner, Malara's ABC affiliate [[WPTA]], with SagamoreHill taking NBC affiliate [[WISE-TV]] instead.&lt;ref name="tvnc-quincygranite"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quincy Buying Stations From Granite, Malara|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/74018/quincy-buying-stations-from-granite-malara|author=Staff writers|work=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|date=February 11, 2014|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

===Effects on programming===
&lt;P align="justify"&gt;The stations partnered through a sharing agreement may also consolidate their programming operations: local newscasts on the junior partner in the LMA, if it operated a separate news department before the LMA's formation, may be rescheduled or scaled back to prevent direct competition with newscasts airing on the station acting as the senior partner (the latter aspect is less common with LMAs involving only stations affiliated with one of the [[Big Three television networks|three largest broadcast television networks]]). The stations may share [[Electronic news-gathering|news-gathering]] resources, but maintain separate news telecasts that are differentiated by their on-air presentation, anchors, and overall format, with varying degrees of autonomy;&lt;ref name=tvnc-wagtstudio /&gt; in these cases, a seemingly separate newscast on the brokered station in the duopoly may ultimately consist of repackaged news content from the other station.&lt;ref name="nyt-change"/&gt; Alternatively, the stations may consolidate their news programming under a single joint brand.&lt;ref name=hsb-tvswap/&gt;&lt;ref name="starbulletin-hnn"/&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;Redundant staff members are often [[Layoff|laid off]] as part of the consolidation process, and the sharing of news content reduces the number of unique editorial voices in the market. This in particular is one of the caveats of pushes to ban outsourcing agreements by media consolidation critics, who also suggest that LMAs result in a decreased amount of local news coverage on the brokered station.&lt;ref name=tvnc-fire/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-change"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hsa-five0"&gt;{{cite news|title=Following ''Five-0'' proves beneficial for late news|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/business/20101217_Following_Five-0_proves_beneficial_for_late_news.html|author=Erika Engle|publisher=Oahu Publications|work=[[Honolulu Star-Advertiser]]|date=December 17, 2010|accessdate=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;Depending on how the outsourcing agreement is structured, as well as how the brokered station is programmed, how the stations are consolidated and the amount of news programming featured on the brokered station may vary, for example:&lt;/P&gt;
* &lt;P align="justify&gt;In October 2008, Tribune Broadcasting and [[Local TV LLC]] consolidated the operations of their respective CW and Fox affiliates in [[Denver]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], resulting from a groupwide management agreement between both companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denver, St. Louis To Get Fox-CW Duops|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/25485/denver-st-louis-to-get-foxcw-duops|author=Harry A.

Both cities were (and still are) top-25 markets, making Denver and St. Louis the largest where any English-language stations were involved in an LMA; however, both cities had enough stations to allow a legal duopoly (this was not possible with KPLR and KTVI as both were among the four highest-rated stations in St. Louis at the time, placing ahead of ratings-challenged ABC affiliate [[KDNL-TV]]), and were large enough to support at least four television news operations (Denver had five and St. Louis had four news-producing stations prior to the formation of the LMA).&lt;/P&gt; 
* &lt;P align="justify"&gt;KWGN and KPLR moved The CW's primetime lineup one hour later (to 8:00 p.m.) than the network-recommended timeslot, and shifted their evening newscasts to 7:00 p.m. (weekend editions of the evening newscasts were discontinued with the move; KPLR has since expanded its 7:00 p.m. newscast to Saturday and Sunday evenings) to avoid competing with KDVR and KTVI's 9:00 p.m. newscasts; KWGN retained its weekday morning newscast (which competes directly with KDVR's morning newscast), but canceled its 5:30 p.m. – and later, 11:00 a.m. – newscasts. In contrast, KPLR (which had run a primetime newscast for much of its history) eventually added hour-long midday and late afternoon newscasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Channel 2 shuffles primetime|url=http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_11940495|author=Joanne Ostrow|work=[[The Denver Post]]|publisher=[[Digital First Media]]|date=March 18, 2009|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fox31 boosts early-evening news to an hour|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2009/01/05/daily19.html|journal=[[Denver Business Journal]]|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CW's KPLR-TV Changes Times, Expands News|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/cws-kplr-tv-changes-times-expands-news-109510|author=Katy Bachman|journal=[[Adweek]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=August 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=KPLR Launches Noon News|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/blog/station-station/kplr-launches-noon-news/67133|author=Michael Malone|journal=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|publisher=[[NewBay Media]]|date=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/television/gail-pennington/off-the-la-freeway-patrick-clark-is-back-home-at/article_0cdc73ca-5e0d-54b3-8814-526c1bede2f1.html|title=Off the LA freeway, Patrick Clark is back home at Ch. 11|author=Gail Pennington|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|date=September 3, 2010|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two LMA arrangements became legal duopolies in December 2013, once Tribune finalized its acquisition of Local TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC OKs Tribune Co.'s agreement to buy Local TV Holdings|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20131220/NEWS06/131229986/tribune-set-to-become-biggest-commercial-tv-owner-in-u-s|work=[[Crain's Chicago Business]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Tribune Closes Acquisition of Local TV Holdings |url=http://corporate.tribune.com/pressroom/?p=6470 |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=December 27, 2013 |accessdate=July 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228101139/http://corporate.tribune.com/pressroom/?p=6470 |archivedate=December 28, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
* &lt;P align="justify"&gt;In 2009, Raycom Media (owner of [[Honolulu]]-based NBC and MyNetworkTV affiliates, [[KHNL]] and [[KFVE]]) announced it would take over the operations of local [[CBS]] affiliate [[KGMB]] (then owned by MCG Capital Corporation), giving it control of three of the television stations in [[Hawaii]]. The deal was a complex arrangement which involved trading the non-license assets of KFVE (such as its [[call sign]], programming, and [[network affiliate|network affiliation]]) for those of KGMB (effectively placing the station under Raycom ownership, but using KFVE's [[broadcast license|license]], signal, and virtual channel 5), and taking over KFVE (which moved to the channel 9 license owned by MCG Capital) under a shared services agreement. Due to its nature, the swap was not a transaction that would require the intervention of the FCC, aside from the changing of call signs. The three stations were then folded into a shared news operation branded as ''[[Hawaii News Now]]''. An estimated 68 positions from a total of 198 from the three stations would be eliminated as part of the agreement.&lt;ref name=hsb-tvswap/&gt;&lt;ref name="starbulletin-hnn"&gt;{{cite web|title=68 to lose jobs in local TV agreement, sources say|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/content/20090818_68_to_lose_jobs_in_local_TV_agreement_sources_say|work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|publisher=Oahu Publications|date=August 18, 2009|accessdate=December 26, 2013|author=Erika Engle|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821080154/http://www.starbulletin.com/news/bulletin/53591667.html|archivedate=August 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, 2013, MCG Capital filed to sell KFVE to the aforementioned American Spirit Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC 315 (Application for Consent to Transfer Control of Entity Holding Broadcast Station Construction Permit or License)|url=https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&amp;appn=101581136&amp;formid=315&amp;fac_num=36917|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=October 2012|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Both stations were consolidated into new, [[High-definition television|high-definition]] capable facilities constructed on the site of a former [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] store, with separate studios for each station, and a third, shared studio. Despite the consolidation, the two stations aimed to maintain some autonomy from each other: both WAGT and WJBF maintained their own on-air identities, newsrooms, and sales departments within the facility. While the newscasts on both stations did share some "factual" video content, they were otherwise produced independently of each other.

* &lt;P align="justify"&gt;In 2010, Nexstar announced a new joint news operation for its consolidated cluster in [[Utica, New York|Utica]]/[[Rome, New York]], which consists of Nexstar-owned Fox and MyNetworkTV affiliates [[WFXV]] and [[WPNY-LP]], and Mission-owned ABC affiliate [[WUTR]]. Unlike the other examples, neither station had a pre-existing newscast at the time; WUTR's original news department was closed in 2003 by previous owner [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel Communications]] as a cost-saving measure, and WFXV had never aired local news programming at all. Its slate included early and late evening newscasts on WUTR, an encore of WUTR's evening newscast on WPNY, and a 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscast on WFXV with a faster, younger-skewing format. The station's [[executive vice president]], Steve Merren (who had come from NBC affiliate [[WKTV]], which had the sole television news operation in the market prior to the formation of Nexstar's ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' operation) believed that it "[was] important that the community has another source of news.

* &lt;P align="justify"&gt;In [[Evansville, Indiana]], Mission Broadcasting acquired then-independent station [[WTVW]] (now a CW affiliate) in 2011 with its former owner Nexstar Broadcasting retaining operational duties under an SSA. WTVW consolidated news operations with ABC affiliate [[WEHT]], for which Nexstar traded WTVW to Mission in exchange for acquiring WEHT from Gilmore Broadcasting Corporation, and had its newscast output reduced through the reductions of its weekday morning newscast from four hours to two and its 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscast – except on Sundays, where it remained one hour – from one hour to 30 minutes (leaving only a two-hour morning newscast, half-hour noon and 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscasts and an hour-long newscast at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.).

* &lt;P align="justify"&gt;In November 2011, in the [[Tucson, Arizona]], market, [[Belo]] relinquished the operations of its Fox and MyNetworkTV duopoly [[KMSB]] and [[KTTU (TV)|KTTU]] to Raycom Media. Operations of the two stations, along with production of KMSB's 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscast, were assumed by Raycom's CBS station [[KOLD-TV]]. Belo Media Operations president Peter L. Diaz touted that the consolidation would result in "better produced, increased news programming for the Tucson market," citing Raycom's addition of a locally produced morning newscast to KMSB, and the upgrade of KMSB's news programming to high definition as part of the transition. Although ruling out the need to do so in other markets, Diaz noted that the agreements "[allowed] us to increase our news product that we couldn't afford to do otherwise." The consolidation resulted in layoffs for almost all of the two stations' employees, aside from advertising sales staff, which remained employed by Belo but worked from KOLD's facilities.&lt;ref name=tvnc-beloraycom&gt;{{cite news|title=Belo Turning Over KMSB, KTTU To KOLD|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/55453/belo-turning-over-kmsb-kttu-to-kold|accessdate=September 21, 2014|work=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|date=November 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of Belo by Gannett in 2013 had few effects on the virtual triopoly; although the stations' licenses were sold to third-parties to satisfy newspaper cross-ownership restrictions, Raycom still operates the stations, but their sales departments remained operated by Gannett.&lt;ref name=itb-saletogannett /&gt; The licenses were, in turn, sold to [[Tegna, Inc.|Tegna]]—the spin-out of Gannett's broadcasting division, in December 2015.&lt;ref name=fcc-saletotegnacomplete&gt;{{cite news|title=Tegna Closes On Sander TV Stations Purchase|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/90476/tegna-closes-on-sander-tv-stations-purchase|accessdate=December 3, 2015|work=TVNewsCheck|date=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;In 2009, the Media Council of Hawaii complained to the FCC about Raycom's ''Hawaii News Now'' operation, stating that it would "directly reduce the diversity of local voices in a community by replacing independent newscasts on the brokered station with those of the brokering station."

===Acquisitions===
====Gannett acquisition of Belo====
[[File:Belo Tower Dallas.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Belo]] Tower in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]].]]
&lt;P align="justify"&gt;Gannett Company's 2013 acquisition of Belo was opposed by organizations such as the American Cable Association and [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]], due to Gannett's plans to use LMAs and two shell companies owned by former Belo and [[Fisher Communications]] executives (respectively, Sander Media and Tucker Operating Co.) to dodge FCC newspaper cross-ownership restrictions in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Tucson]]. Although Gannett contended that the arrangements were legal, Free Press president Craig Aaron stated that "the FCC shouldn't let Gannett break the rules. Media consolidation results in fewer journalists in the newsroom and fewer opinions on the airwaves. Concentrating media outlets in the hands of just a few companies benefits only the companies themselves." The deal would have given Gannett a virtual triopoly in Phoenix, consisting of its NBC station [[KPNX]], independent station [[KTVK]] and CW affiliate [[KASW]]. In Tucson, Fox affiliate KMSB and MyNetworkTV affiliate KTTU were already operated by Raycom Media's CBS affiliate KOLD-TV under a shared services agreement established under Belo ownership, but Gannett would still handle advertising sales for the stations.&lt;ref name=itb-saletogannett/&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;In December 2013, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] blocked Gannett from using an agreement with Sander Media to operate CBS affiliate [[KMOV]] in St. Louis alongside its own NBC station [[KSDK]], and ordered Gannett to sell KMOV. Even though Gannett planned to operate KMOV separately from KSDK, the Department ruled the agreement to be a violation of [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]], as it would reduce competition for advertising sales.&lt;ref name="bandc-sanderkmov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice: Sander Can't Keep KMOV|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/justice-sander-cant-keep-kmov/127991|author=John Eggerton|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|publisher=[[NewBay Media]]|date=December 16, 2013|accessdate=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the closure of the Belo purchase, [[Meredith Corporation]] announced a deal to purchase KMOV, along with KTVK and KASW. As Meredith would have a duopoly between KTVK and its Phoenix CBS affiliate [[KPHO-TV]], KASW was to be sold to SagamoreHill Broadcasting and operated by Meredith under an LMA.&lt;ref name=adweek-gannett/&gt;&lt;ref name="itb-saletogannett"&gt;{{cite news|title=Little change on Tucson TV expected from Belo's sale to Gannett|url=http://www.insidetucsonbusiness.com/news/little-change-on-tucson-tv-expected-from-belo-s-sale/article_df926a4a-d470-11e2-9fca-001a4bcf887a.html|author=David Hatfield|work=[[Inside Tucson Business]]|date=June 13, 2013|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tvnc-meredith"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meredith Buying Three Stations from Gannett|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/72891/meredith-buying-three-stations-from-gannett|author=Staff writers|work=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|date=December 23, 2013|accessdate=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the FCC's scrutiny on any new station sharing agreements, on October 23, 2014, Meredith would backtrack on this plan and instead sell KASW to the Nexstar Broadcasting Group, which would operate the station independently of KTVK and KPHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nexstar Buying KASW Phoenix For $68M|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/80251/nexstar-buying-kasw-phoenix-for-68m|work=TVNewsCheck|date=October 23, 2014|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;Following Gannett's split into independent broadcasting and publishing companies, [[Tegna, Inc.]]—the owner of Gannett's stations following the split, bought back the licenses to the Sander Media stations, placing them back under its full control.&lt;ref name="fcc-saletotegnacomplete"/&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

====Sinclair acquisition of Allbritton====
&lt;P align="justify&gt;As part of its planned acquisition of [[Allbritton Communications]], Sinclair originally planned to sell its existing stations in three markets – [[Charleston, South Carolina]], [[Birmingham, Alabama]] and [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] – where Allbritton already owned stations, but continue to operate them under local marketing agreements. [[WABM]] and [[WTTO]] in Birmingham and [[WHP-TV]] in Harrisburg were to be sold to [[Deerfield Media]], and WMMP in Charleston was to be sold to Howard Stirk Holdings – a broadcasting company owned by conservative pundit [[Armstrong Williams]].&lt;ref name="tvnc-sinclairsidecar"/&gt; Howard Stirk Holdings was also used as a sidecar for two conflicting stations in Sinclair's earlier acquisition of [[Barrington Broadcasting]].&lt;ref name=newsmax-stirk&gt;{{cite news|title=Armstrong Williams Purchases TV Stations|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/armstrong-williams-buys-tv/2013/02/28/id/492555/|author=Jim Meyers|work=[[Newsmax]]|date=February 28, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;In December 2013, FCC Video Division Chief Barbara Kreisman sent a letter demanding information from the Sinclair Broadcast Group on the financial aspects of its "sidecar" operations, and warned that in the three aforementioned markets, "the proposed transactions would result in the elimination of the [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]] status of certain local marketing agreements and thus cause the transactions to violate our local TV ownership rules."&lt;ref name="tvnc-sinclairsidecar"/&gt; It was asserted that the deal might only be legal if the affected stations were operated under shared services agreements.&lt;ref name="tvnc-sinclairsidecar"&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC Targets Sinclair Sidecar Deals In 3 Mkts.|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/72517/fcc-targets-sinclair-sidecar-deals-in-3-mkts|author=Doug Halonen|work=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=December 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-sinclairdeal"&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC Asks Sinclair to Revise Plans to Use 'Sidecar' Companies|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303722104579242653224582292|author=Keach Hagey|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=December 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair restructured the deal in March 2014, choosing to sell WHP-TV, WMMP and WABM, and terminate an SSA with the Cunningham-owned Fox affiliate [[WTAT]] in Charleston to acquire the Allbritton-owned stations in those markets ([[WCIV]], [[WHTM-TV]] and [[WBMA-LD]], while also creating a new duopoly between the [[WBMA-LD|ABC]] and [[WTTO|CW]] affiliates in Birmingham), as well as foregoing any operational or financial agreements with the buyers of the stations being sold to other parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sinclair Offers to Sell Stations Ahead of FCC Decision|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvspy/sinclair-offers-to-sell-stations-ahead-of-fcc-decision_b117802|author=Kevin Eck|work=TVSpy|publisher=[[Mediabistro]]|date=March 21, 2014|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Sinclair Proposes Restructuring of Allbritton Transaction in Order To Meet Objections of the Federal Communications Commission|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20140320-913206.html|via=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|location=Baltimore|date=March 20, 2014|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

===FCC limits on joint sales agreements for television stations===
&lt;P align="justify"&gt;In response to criticism of the virtual duopolies and sharing agreements, the FCC began to consider potential changes to address these loopholes. In March 2013, the Commission first tabled a proposal that would make joint sales agreements count the same as ownership.&lt;ref name="tvnc-jsaoverhaul"&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC's Pai: JSA Overhaul Plan Still In Play|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/65938/fccs-pai-jsa-overhaul-plan-still-in-play|author=Doug Halonen|work=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckGroup|date=March 5, 2013|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;In January 2014 town hall meeting, FCC chairman Tom Wheeler disclosed that he planned to place more scrutiny on the use of LMA-style agreements and shell companies, stating that "there were a couple of references in a couple of recent decisions in which we've said that we're going to do things differently going forward on what were called these shell corporations." Later that month, it was reported that the FCC had placed all pending acquisitions involving the use of shell companies on hold, so the Commission could discuss changes to its policies. Among the deals affected by this decision included the aforementioned Sinclair/Allbritton purchase.&lt;ref name="tvnc-wheelerblock"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Wheeler Putting Brakes on SSAs|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/73494/report-wheeler-putting-brakes-on-ssas|author=Doug Halonen|work=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|date=January 23, 2014|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tvnc-closerlook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wheeler Vows To Take Closer Look at SSAs|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/73226/wheeler-vows-to-take-closer-look-at-ssas?ref=search|author=Doug Halonen|work=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|date=January 10, 2014|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;On March 6, 2014, the FCC announced that it would hold a vote on March 31 on a proposal to ban joint sales agreements involving television stations outright, making them attributable to FCC ownership limits if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time of a competing junior partner station in the JSA; the ban applies to both existing sharing agreements under such a structure as well as pending station transactions that include a JSA. Station owners would be given a two-year grace period to unwind or modify joint sales agreements in violation of the policy; coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market would also be barred under the proposal. Wheeler also proposed an expedited process to review joint sales agreements on a case-by-case basis, granting a waiver of the rules if a broadcaster can prove a particular joint sales agreement arrangement serves the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wheeler Moves To End Sharing Agreements|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/74631/wheeler-moves-to-end-sharing-agreements|author=Doug Halonen|work=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|date=March 6, 2014|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FCC proposes to curb TV stations' joint sales deals|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/03/06/fcc-proposes-ending-joint-sales-agreements/6128271/|author=Roger Yu|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;On March 12, 2014, the FCC Media Bureau released a notice that it would further analyze television station transactions that include sharing agreements, particularly those that include a purchase option that "may counter any incentive the licensee has to increase the value of the station, since the licensee may be unlikely to realize that increased value."&lt;ref name="tvnc-scrutinize"/&gt; Under the new provisions, broadcasters must demonstrate in their transaction applications as to how such deals would serve the public interest.&lt;ref name="tvnc-scrutinize"&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC To Scrutinize Station Sales with SSAs|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/74769/fcc-to-scrutinize-station-sales-with-ssas|author=Doug Halonen|work=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|date=March 12, 2014|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Association of Broadcasters]] (NAB) – which, along with station groups such as Sinclair Broadcast Group, have disapproved of the proposal to ban JSAs – presented a compromise proposal, in which the brokered licensee in a sharing agreement would retain control over at least 85 percent of the station's programming, maintain at least 70 percent of ad sales revenue and "maintain at least 20 percent of station value in the license itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/74837/nab-proposes-jsa-compromise-plan|title=NAB Proposes JSA Compromise Plan|author=Doug Halonen|work=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|date=March 14, 2014|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; FCC commissioner [[Ajit Varadaraj Pai|Ajit Pai]], and Gordon Smith, president of the NAB, were also opposed to the new rules on joint sales agreements, believing that they would discourage the ownership of television stations by [[Minority business enterprise|minority-owned companies]].&lt;ref name=bandc-allbrittonapproved /&gt;&lt;ref name=adweek-takeaim&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC Takes Aim at TV Joint Sales Deals|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/fcc-takes-aim-tv-joint-sales-deals-156130|author=Katy Bachman|work=Adweek|date=March 6, 2014|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Wheeler, however, proposed the restrictions in the hopes of encouraging more women and minorities to own stations, due to the ongoing consolidation in the television industry through company mergers and sharing agreements.&lt;ref name=tvnc-diversityclaim&gt;{{cite web|title=Wheeler's Diversity Claim Is A Fantasy|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/75149/wheelers-diversity-claim-is-a-fantasy|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;On March 31, 2014, the FCC voted 3–2 to approve the proposed ban on joint sales agreements and voted 5–0 to approve the proposed ban on coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations within a given market; the JSA ban went into effect on June 19, 2014.&lt;ref name="fcc-jsabandate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Bureau Announces the Effective Date of the Television Joint Sales Agreement Attribution Rule|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2014/db0618/DA-14-835A1.pdf|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=June 18, 2014|accessdate=June 18, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727025122/http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2014/db0618/DA-14-835A1.pdf|archivedate=July 27, 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the restrictions, the FCC would rule on waivers to maintain select existing JSAs within 90 days of the application's filing.

Despite this fact, broadcasting companies criticized the ban, accusing the Commission of using it as a move to encourage participation in a [[spectrum reallocation|spectrum incentive auction]] then set to occur in 2015, and stating that the ban would place them at a disadvantage during retransmission consent negotiations with pay television providers.&lt;ref name="tvnc-jsabanproposed04"&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC's Lake: FCC Not At War Over JSAs|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/75381/fccs-lake-fcc-not-at-war-over-jsas|author=Doug Halonen|work=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|date=April 7, 2014|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b&amp;c-jsabanproposal04"&gt;{{cite journal|title=FCC May Tighten Joint Sales Rules|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/fcc-may-tighten-joint-sales-rules/104005|author=Bill McConnell|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=August 3, 2004|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

===Divestment and subchannel consolidation of stations===
&lt;P align="justify"&gt;The increased scrutiny being imposed by the FCC regarding local marketing, shared services, and joint sales agreements have led to more drastic measures by broadcasting companies attempting to use them in acquisitions; in 2014, two broadcasting companies declared intents to shut acquired stations down entirely and consolidate their programming onto existing stations through multicasting, rather than attempting to use sidecars and sharing agreements or selling them to other parties that would assume full responsibility of their day-to-day operations.&lt;ref name="rbr-grayshutdown"/&gt;&lt;ref name="b&amp;c-wcftwjsuclosing?"/&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;In May 2014, Sinclair informed the FCC that it was unable to find buyers for WABM or WMMP – the company's MyNetworkTV stations in Birmingham, Alabama and Charleston, South Carolina that it planned to sell in its purchase of Allbritton Communications. In Birmingham, the company proposed surrendering the licenses of WCFT-TV and WJSU-TV – the two full-powered [[broadcast relay station#satellite stations|satellites]] of ABC affiliate WBMA-LD, converting WABM into a full-powered satellite of WBMA-LD – and moving its existing MyNetworkTV programming to a digital subchannel of WABM (although the WBMA-LD simulcast was placed on WABM's subchannel instead while MyNetworkTV programming was retained on its main channel). Similarly, in Charleston, Sinclair planned to surrender WCIV's license and move its ABC affiliation and programming to WMMP. In both cases, Sinclair believed that its own stations had superior technical facilities than those of the stations it intends to surrender.&lt;ref name="tvnc-wcftwjsuclosing?"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sinclair Giving Up 3 Stations To Appease FCC|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/76663/sinclair-giving-up-3-stations-to-appease-fcc|author=Harry A.

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;On June 13, 2014, Gray Television announced that it would shutter six stations and consolidate existing programming onto subchannels of Gray-owned stations in their respective market. Unlike Sinclair, however, Gray stated that it would sell the licenses of the shuttered stations to minority-owned broadcasters in collaboration with the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council – under the condition that they would operate them independently from other stations in the market, and without the use of any sharing agreements. All six of the stations were owned by companies other than Gray, but their non-license assets are either owned by Gray, or were operated by stations now owned by Gray under agreements. Gray would operate the affected stations under LMAs until the sales and consolidation are complete. Aside from one, most of the stations involved in these changes were related to Gray's acquisition of stations from [[Hoak Media]]. Three of these stations were immediately shut down the same day, while the remainder remained operated by Gray until the sales were completed.&lt;ref name="rbr-grayshutdown"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gray closes Hoak deal; completes refinancing|url=http://rbr.com/gray-closes-hoak-deal-completes-refinancing/|author=Carl Marcucci|publisher=Streamline RBR|work=Radio &amp; Television Business Report|date=June 13, 2014|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tvnc-hoakgray"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gray Buying Hoak, Prime Stations For $342.5M|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/72138/gray-buying-hoak-prime-stations-for-3425m|author=Staff writers|work=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|date=November 20, 2013|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gray-hoakminority"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Gray Retains Minority Media and Telecommunications Council as Exclusive Broker for Transfer of Former Shared Services Stations|url=http://gray.tv/index.php?page=press-releases&amp;releaseid=1939828|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|location=Atlanta|via=[[Gray Television]]|date=June 13, 2014|accessdate=June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray announced buyers for the stations on August 27, 2014.&lt;ref name=tvnc-grayminoritysales/&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Gray had bought KSNB under a failing station waiver to form a duopoly with CBS station [[KOLN|KOLN/KGIN]], and operated the station as a [[MyNetworkTV]]/[[MeTV]] affiliate with local programming focused on central Nebraska; this existing programming was moved to KSNB-DT2 upon the transition.&lt;ref name="tvnc-1011cn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gray Lines Up 2nd Station In Lincoln, NE|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/63748/gray-lines-up-2nd-station-in-lincoln-ne|author=Harry A.

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;Following the approval of Sinclair's purchase of Allbritton, commissioner Ajit Pai further criticized the FCC's new policies and its endorsement of Sinclair's proposal to shut down stations to comply with them. Describing the three Allbritton stations as being "victims" of the "crackdown" against joint sales agreements, he stated regarding WCIV that "apparently the Commission believes that it is better for that station to go out of business than for Howard Stirk Holdings to own the station and participate in a joint sales agreement with Sinclair. I strongly disagree. And so too, I'll bet, would consumers in Charleston."&lt;ref name=bandc-allbrittonapproved /&gt; In September 2014, Sinclair backtracked on its original plans, and reached deals to sell WCIV, WCFT and WJSU's license assets to Howard Stirk Holdings for $50,000 each and lease them studio space, pending FCC approval. Unlike Howard Stirk Holdings' other stations, they are operated and programmed independently, and Sinclair did not enter into any agreements to operate the stations on HSH's behalf.&lt;ref name=fcc-hshwciv&gt;{{cite web|title=Application For Consent To Assignment Of Broadcast Station Construction Permit Or License|url=https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&amp;appn=101650192&amp;formid=314&amp;fac_num=21536|website=CDBS Public Access, [[Federal Communications Commission]]|publisher=Charleston Television, LLC|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bc-hsh&gt;{{cite news|title=Howard Stirk Holdings Grabs WCIV for $50,000|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/howard-stirk-holdings-grabs-wciv-50000/134123|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|accessdate=September 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION AND UNIQUE SERVICE TO BE PROVIDED|url=https://licensing.fcc.gov/cdbs/CDBS_Attachment/getattachment.jsp?appn=101650192&amp;qnum=5040&amp;copynum=1&amp;exhcnum=2|publisher=Howard Stirk Holdings|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Application For Consent To Assignment Of Broadcast Station Construction Permit Or License|url=https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&amp;appn=101651545&amp;formid=314&amp;fac_num=21258|publisher=TV Alabama, Inc.|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;In Quincy Newspapers' acquisition of Granite Broadcasting's remaining stations, the acquisition was briefly re-structured to have [[Malara Broadcast Group]]—which served as a virtual duopoly partner for Granite with [[WISE-TV]] (NBC) Fort Wayne and [[KDLH-TV]] Duluth (CBS), retain the stations and their current agreements with [[WPTA]] and [[KBJR-TV]] in lieu of having them sold to SagamoreHill Broadcasting. The acquisition was restructured in July 2015 to, again, have SagamoreHill Broadcasting acquire the two stations, but have their current SSAs wound down within nine months. Following the end of the SSA, the two stations retained The CW as independently-run stations, with their remaining affiliations moved to subchannels of KBJR and WPTA.&lt;ref name=quincy-amend&gt;{{cite web|title=Amended Description of Agreements, Description of Transaction, and Request for Temporary Waiver|url=https://licensing.fcc.gov/cdbs/CDBS_Attachment/getattachment.jsp?appn=101683852&amp;qnum=5120&amp;copynum=1&amp;exhcnum=2|publisher=Quincy Newspapers, Inc.|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fcc-kdlhnosagamorehill&gt;{{cite web|title=Amendment to Agreements and Description of Transaction (KBJR-TV)|url=https://licensing.fcc.gov/cdbs/CDBS_Attachment/getattachment.jsp?appn=101656471&amp;qnum=5120&amp;copynum=1&amp;exhcnum=1|website=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=November 25, 2014|format=PDF|date=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fcc-wisenosagamorehill&gt;{{cite web|title=Application For Consent To Assignment Of Broadcast Station Construction Permit Or License|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1654085&amp;Service=DT&amp;Form_id=314&amp;Facility_id=13960|website=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quincy similarly wound down an SSA in [[Peoria, Illinois]] with Sinclair-owned [[WHOI (TV)|WHOI]] by trading its [[South Bend]] Fox affiliation (previously held by [[WSJV-TV]]) to Sinclair (where it moved to a subchannel of [[WSBT-TV]]), in exchange for WHOI's ABC and CW affiliations, which moved to subchannels of [[WEEK-TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvspy/sinclair-and-quincy-make-affiliation-deal-wsjv-employees-wonder-whats-next/175045|title=Sinclair and Quincy Make Affiliation Deal, WSJV Employees Wonder What’s Next|last=Eck|first=Kevin|date=26 July 2016|work=TVSpy|publisher=[[Adweek]] Blog Network|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pjr-weekabccw"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tarter|first1=Steve|title=WEEK-TV to broadcast ABC and CW signals|url=http://www.pjstar.com/news/20160726/new-digital-channels-coming-for-whoi-and-cw|accessdate=July 27, 2016|work=[[Peoria Journal-Star]]|date=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

===WAGT dispute===
[[File:TV Networks in the former Barnes &amp; Noble Augusta GA.jpg|thumb|right|Outside Television Park, the facilities which were shared by [[WJBF]] and [[WAGT (TV)|WAGT]].]]
&lt;P align="justify"&gt;In February 2016, Gray Television acquired [[Schurz Communications]]' stations, including [[Augusta, Georgia]]'s [[WAGT (TV)|WAGT]]. As Gray could not own both WAGT and its existing [[CBS]] affiliate [[WRDW-TV]] as a legal duopoly, Gray proposed the sale of WAGT's broadcast spectrum during the incentive auction, and for WAGT to go silent upon completion of the deal so the company would not be running more than one of the top four stations in the market.&lt;ref name="bcapproved"/&gt;  Gray also requested special temporary authority for WAGT's signal to be replaced on its existing technical facilities and UHF channel 30 by the co-owned low-power station, [[WAGT-CD|WRDW-CD]] (low-power stations are not subject to ownership caps or the duopoly rule).&lt;ref name="fcc-lptv"/&gt;&lt;ref name=graysta-wrdw&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering Statement - Request For Special Temporary Authority |url=https://enterpriseefiling.fcc.gov/dataentry/api/download/attachment/25076ff351ac3b780151b0933c44021d |publisher=Chesapeake RF Consultants, LLC/Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=January 20, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131050652/https://enterpriseefiling.fcc.gov/dataentry/api/download/attachment/25076ff351ac3b780151b0933c44021d |archivedate=January 31, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;The FCC, however, required that Gray continue to operate WAGT as a separate station through the end of the auction, and not enter into any joint sales agreements.&lt;ref name="bcapproved"&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/fcc-approves-gray-schurz-tv-station-deal/153781 FCC Approves Gray-Schurz TV Station Deal].

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;On February 26, 2016, Media General obtained a preliminary injunction against Gray for violating the SSA and JSA, which required that Gray return control of WAGT to Media General, and forbade Gray from selling WAGT in the spectrum incentive auction. The company accused Gray of using the spectrum auction and sale of the station to exit the agreements illegitimately, as they were to last through 2020, and apply to any future owner of WAGT. Gray attempted to block the injunction by arguing that its actions were required in order to comply with the FCC's prohibition of joint sales agreements, but was denied.&lt;ref name="chron-injunction"&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge's action may delay WAGT sale

&lt;P align="justify"&gt;On March 10, 2016, FCC Deputy General Counsel David Gossett announced that the Commission would investigate Media General's actions as possibly being in violation of Section 310(d) of the [[Communications Act of 1934|Communications Act]]. Gossett argued that by legally blocking Gray's participation in the spectrum auction, Media General had "[sought] injunctive relief that interferes with a licensee's ultimate control of a station". He also stated that the FCC could consider a license revocation hearing against Media General under Section 312 of the Communications Act.&lt;ref name="tvnc-fccinvestigation"&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC Launches Investigation Of Media General|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/93012/fcc-launches-investigation-of-media-general|accessdate=March 10, 2016|work=TVNewsCheck}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fcc-dojinterest"&gt;{{cite web|title=Case 1:16-cv-00026-JRH-BKE Document 33|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2016/db0309/DOC-338152A1.pdf|publisher=United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 23, 2016, the Supreme Court of Georgia struck down the injunction without addressing the litigation, and Gray took back control of WAGT.&lt;ref name="chron-struckdown"&gt;{{cite news|title=Georgia Supreme Court strikes down Superior Court injunction over WAGT|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/business/local-business/2016-03-23/georgia-supreme-court-strikes-down-superior-court-injunction|accessdate=March 24, 2016|work=Augusta Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13, 2016, Media General was issued a $700,000 fine by the FCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Matter of Media General Operations, Inc.|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2016/db0713/DA-16-794A1.pdf|publisher=FCC|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; WAGT's spectrum sold for $40,763,036.&lt;ref name="fccauction-result"&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC Broadcast Television Spectrum Incentive Auction - Winning Bids|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db0413/DA-17-314A2.pdf|publisher=FCC|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

==Internationally==
&lt;P align="justify"&gt;In a 2005 Canadian dispute, Rogers Media and [[Newcap Broadcasting]] maintained a joint sales agreement pertaining to [[CHNO-FM]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario, but community interests and the lobby group [[Friends of Canadian Broadcasting]] presented substantial evidence to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission that in practice, the agreement was a ''de facto'' LMA, going significantly beyond advertising sales into program production and news-gathering. LMAs in Canada cannot be implemented without the CRTC's approval, and in early 2005, the CRTC ordered the agreement to cease.&lt;ref name="crtc-rogersjsa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2005–22|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2005/db2005-22.htm|publisher=[[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]|location=Ottawa|date=January 31, 2005|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align="justify&gt;In 2008, the [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[Associated Broadcasting Company]] leased its airtime to the [[Malaysia|Malaysian]] broadcaster [[Media Prima]] (through the local subsidiary MPB Primedia) similar to an LMA – with MPB Primedia providing entertainment programming, and ABC handling news programming and operations. Soon afterward, ABC and Media Prima were sued by rival media company [[GMA Network, Inc.|GMA]] for attempting to use the partnership to skirt laws requiring domestic ownership of broadcasters. In response, ABC's media relations head Pat Marcelo-Magbanua reiterated that the subsidiary was a Filipino company which was self-registered and Filipino-run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/articles/17890/TV5-is-a-Filipino-company,-defends-one-of-its-executives|title='TV5 is a Filipino company', defends one of its executives|author=Nerisa Almo|work=[[Philippine Entertainment Portal]]|publisher=[[GMA New Media]]|date=January 5, 2009|accessdate=January 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concerns became moot in 2010, when Media Prima announced it would divest its ownership in the network to [[PLDT]]'s broadcasting subsidiary [[MediaQuest Holdings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/25119/Revamped-TV5-parades-new-programs-and-roster-of-stars-at-its-trade-launch|title=Revamped TV5 parades new programs and roster of stars at its trade launch|author=Bong Godinez|work=[[Philippine Entertainment Portal]]|publisher=[[GMA New Media]]|date=March 26, 2010|accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

'''Eamonn Noel Kelly''' (born 9 January 1951), known as '''Nicky Kelly''', is an Irish politician from [[Arklow]] in [[County Wicklow]].  He was born Edward Noel Kelly from [[Graiguenamanagh]], [[County Kilkenny]]. A member of [[Official Sinn Féin]], later on he left it to join the new [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;"Round Up the Usual Suspects - Nicky Kelly &amp; The Cosgrave Coalition", by Dunne, Derek &amp; Kerrigan, Gene, ''[[Magill]]'', Dublin, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
In the 1980s Kelly achieved fame throughout Ireland after he had been sentenced, in 1978, to 12 years in prison for his alleged part in the [[Sallins Train Robbery]]. The ensuing campaign to release him became a symbol of the 1980s with 'Free Nicky Kelly' graffiti posted throughout the country. The evidence of [[torture]] committed against him and his two co-accused, Osgur Breatnach and Brian McNally, galvanized a campaign for his release. There was a dedication to him in the 1983 [[Planxty]] album, ''[[Words &amp; Music (Planxty album)|Words &amp; Music]]''.

The future [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]] TD, [[Pat McCartan]] acted as his solicitor at this time, despite being on opposite sides in the Official Sinn Féin/IRSP split.&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1991/10/22/00025.asp Adjournment Debate. - Nicky Kelly Case], 22 October 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 Kelly was eventually released on "humanitarian grounds". He received a presidential pardon in 1992, along with over £1 million as compensation following campaigns by [[Amnesty International|Amnesty]] and the [[Irish Council for Civil Liberties|ICCL]].

The events of Kelly's arrest and trial(s) were the subject of an edition of the RTÉ documentary series Scannal, broadcast 22 September 2014.

==Political career==
Kelly was elected to Arklow Town Council in 1991 and for [[Wicklow County Council]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=4215 Nicky Kelly election history] www.electionsireland.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 he joined the Labour party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/nicky-kelly-set-to-join-labour-within-weeks-346293.html Nicky Kelly set to join Labour 'within weeks'] by Gene McKenna, ''[[Irish Independent]]'', 24 May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 he was elected mayor of [[Arklow]].

He stood unsuccessfully as a Labour party candidate for the [[Wicklow (Dáil constituency)|Wicklow]] constituency at the [[Irish general election, 2002|2002 general election]] where he was beaten to the final seat by [[Mildred Fox]] by 19 votes, and in the 2007 general election, where his first-preference vote declined from 12% in 2002 to 6%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishnews.com/pageacc.asp?tser1=ser&amp;par=ben&amp;sid=230708 Irishnews.com Ex-IRSP man still in talks]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Valerie Robinson, 2 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2011, he left the Labour Party over a dispute about candidate selection at the party's convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wicklownews.net/index.php/2011/02/election-2011-nicky-kelly-enters-dail-race/ WicklowNews.net Election 2011: Nicky Kelly enters Dail race] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212142442/http://www.wicklownews.net/index.php/2011/02/election-2011-nicky-kelly-enters-dail-race |date=2011-02-12 }}, Stephen Dunne, 8 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite rumours that he was intending on joining [[Sinn Féin]] or the [[United Left Alliance]] he stood at the [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 general election]] as an independent candidate in the Wicklow constituency. He was not elected getting only 0.7% of the first-preference vote.

He lost his seat at the 2014 local elections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3940">'''Orphaned technology''' is a descriptive term for [[computer]] products, programs, and platforms that have been abandoned by their original developers.  Orphaned technology refers to [[software]], such as [[abandonware]] and [[Vintage computing|antique]] software, but also to [[computer hardware]] and practices.  In computer software standards and documentation, [[deprecation]] is the gradual phasing-out of a software or [[programming language]] feature, while orphaning usually connotes a sudden discontinuation, usually for business-related reasons, of a product with an active user base.

For users of technologies that have been withdrawn from the market, there is a choice between maintaining their software support environments in some form of [[emulation (computing)|emulation]], or switching to other supported products, possibly losing capabilities unique to their original solution.

&lt;!-- Suggest adding the year of discontinuance, and sorting in that order; See Talk:Orphaned technology --&gt;
Some well-known examples of orphaned technology include:
* [[Coleco ADAM]] - 8-bit [[home computer]]
* [[TI 99/4A]] - 16-bit [[home computer]]
* [[Mattel Aquarius]]
* [[Apple Lisa]] - 16/32-bit graphical computer
* [[Apple Newton|Newton PDA]] (Apple Newton) - tablet computer
* [[DEC Alpha]] - 64-bit [[microprocessor]]
* [[HyperCard]] - hypermedia
* [[ICAD (software)|ICAD (KBE)]] - knowledge-based engineering
* [[Javelin Software]] - modeling and data analysis
* [[LISP machines]] - LISP oriented computers
* [[Classic Mac OS]] - [[m68k]] and [[PowerPC]] operating system
* [[Microsoft Bob]] - graphical helper
* [[Windows 9x]] - x86 operating system
* [[OpenDoc]] - compound documents ([[Mac OS]], [[OS/2]])
* [[Prograph]] - visual programming system
* [[Poly-1]] - parallel networked computer designed in New Zealand for use in education and training
* [[Mosaic notation program]] - music notation application by [[Mark of the Unicorn]]&lt;ref&gt;(19 August 2008).

Symbolics Inc's operating systems, [[Genera (operating system)|Genera]] and OpenGenera, were twice orphaned, as they were ported from [[LISP machines]] to computers using the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] [[64-bit]] CPU.{{elucidate|date=May 2014}}

User groups often exist for specific orphaned technologies, such as The [[Hong Kong]] [[Newton (platform)|Newton]] User Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crmloyalty.com/hknug/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311170255/http://www.crmloyalty.com/hknug/ |archivedate=2007-03-11 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Symbolics Lisp [Machines] Users' Group (now known as the Association of Lisp Users),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alu.org/alu/about|title=About Us|publisher=Association of Lisp Users|accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Newton Reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panix.com/~clay/newton/ |title=Newton Reference |website=Panix.com |date=1998-02-27 |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Sibelius_(scorewriter)#'Save_Sibelius'_campaign|Save Sibelius]] group sprang into existence because [[Sibelius (scorewriter)]] users feared the application would be orphaned after its owners [[Avid Tech]] fired most of the development team, who were thereafter hired by [[Steinberg]] to develop the competing product, [[Dorico]].

'''Parliamentary privilege''' is a [[Immunity from prosecution|legal immunity]] enjoyed by members of certain [[legislature]]s, in which legislators are granted protection against civil or criminal liability for actions done or statements made in the course of their legislative duties. It is common in countries whose [[constitution]]s are based on the [[Westminster system]].

== Origins ==
In the United Kingdom, it allows members of the [[House of Lords]] and [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to speak freely during ordinary parliamentary proceedings without fear of legal action on the grounds of [[slander]], [[contempt of court]] or breaching the [[Official Secrets Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-04905.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423161135/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-04905.pdf |archivedate=2010-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/businessBulletin/bb-99/bb-06-08an.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423184123/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/businessBulletin/bb-99/bb-06-08an.htm |archivedate=2010-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also means that [[Member of Parliament|members of Parliament]] cannot be arrested on civil matters for statements made or acts undertaken as an MP within the grounds of the [[Palace of Westminster]], on the condition that such statements or acts occur as part of a ''proceeding in Parliament''—for example, as a question&lt;ref&gt;But in [[Italy]] the Constitutional Court has recognized privilege also to a text - the inadmissible written question - never published on the parliamentary acts: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = E la 140/03 (per la parte superstite) entra per la prima volta in una decisione di merito sull'insindacabilità delle opinioni|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2004| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89381928}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the Prime Minister in the House of Commons. This allows Members to raise questions or debate issues which could slander an individual, interfere with an ongoing court case or threaten to reveal state secrets, such as in the [[Zircon affair]] or several cases mentioned by the Labour MP [[Tam Dalyell]].

There is no immunity from arrest on criminal grounds, nor does the civil privilege entirely extend to the devolved administrations in Scotland or Wales.&lt;ref name="UKSpeaker3Dec2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm081203/debtext/81203-0001.htm#08120351000001|title=Speaker's Statement |publisher=[[Hansard]] |work=House of Commons Daily Debates |date=3 December 2008 |accessdate=5 December 2008 |quote=I should also remind the House, as stated in chapter 7 of "Erskine May," that parliamentary privilege has never prevented the operation of the criminal law. [Interruption.] Order. The Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in its authoritative report in 1999 said that the precincts of the House are not and should not be "a haven from the law".}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consequence of the privilege of free speech is that legislators in Westminster systems are forbidden by conventions of their House from uttering certain words, or implying that another member is lying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/business/debates/|title=How Parliament works|publisher=www.parliament.uk|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[unparliamentary language]].)

The rights and privileges of members are overseen by the powerful [[Committee on Standards and Privileges]]. If a member of the House is in breach of the rules then he/she can be suspended or even expelled from the House. Such past breaches have included giving false evidence before a committee of the House and the taking of bribes by members.

Similar rights apply in other Westminster system countries such as Canada and Australia. In the United States, the [[Speech or Debate Clause]] in [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] provides for a similar privilege, and many [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] provide similar clauses for their [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]].

Parliamentary privilege is controversial because of its potential for abuse; a member can use privilege to make damaging allegations that would ordinarily be discouraged by defamation laws, whether or not those allegations have a strong foundation. A member could, even more seriously, undermine national security and/or the safety of an ongoing military or covert operation or undermine relations with a foreign state by releasing sensitive military or diplomatic information.

==UK House of Commons==
{{main|Parliamentary privilege in the United Kingdom}}
The ancient and undoubted rights and privileges of the Commons are claimed by the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]] at the beginning of each new Parliament. The privileges are only codified in ''Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice'' and the House itself is the only judge of its own privileges. Most of those specifically claimed are practically obsolete, but others remain very real:

# [[Freedom of speech]]; (members speaking in the House are not liable for defamation)
# Freedom from [[arrest]] in civil matters (practically obsolete);&lt;ref name="UKSpeaker3Dec2008"/&gt;
# Access of the Commons to [[the Crown]] (via the Speaker); and
# That ''the most favourable construction should be placed upon the deliberations of the Commons.''

Privileges not specifically mentioned:

# Right of the House to regulate its own composition; (although election petitions are now determined by the ordinary Courts)
# Right of the House to regulate its own internal proceedings, both as to matters and procedures;
# Right to punish members and "[[Strangers (Parliament of the United Kingdom)|strangers]]" for breach of privilege and contempt;
# Right of freedom from interference (although members are no longer immune from all civil actions)

===Parliamentary papers===
There is an absolute [[common law]] privilege for papers circulated among MPs by order of the House (''Lake v. King'' (1667) 1 Saunders 131). This is extended to all papers published under the House's authority, and to correct copies by the [[Parliamentary Papers Act 1840]]. The Act also extends [[qualified privilege]] to extracts.

===Select committees===
In addition to applying to members' speech within the chamber, parliamentary privilege also applies to select committees.  Written and oral evidence given to, and published by these committees is also subject to the same absolute privilege as parliamentary papers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/witnessguide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that any evidence given by a witness to a select committee may not be used against them or any other person in a court of law, whether for civil or criminal proceedings.  This privilege only applies, however, if the committee has formally accepted it as evidence and does not apply to materials published before they were given to the committee.

==In Canada==
In Canada, the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] and [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] and provincial [[legislative assembly|legislative assemblies]] follow the definition of parliamentary privilege offered by the British parliamentary authority, ''Erskine May's Treatise on The Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament'', which defines parliamentary privilege as "the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed by each House collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of Parliament, and by Members of each house individually, without which they could not discharge their function... the privileges of Parliament are rights which are absolutely necessary for the due execution of its powers. They are enjoyed by individual Members, because the House cannot perform its functions without unimpeded use of the service of its Members, and by each House for the protection of its members and the vindication of its own authority and dignity."  Parliamentary privilege can therefore be claimed by Members individually or by the House collectively.

The rule for when parliamentary privilege applies is that it cannot exceed the powers, privileges and immunities of the imperial parliament as it stood in 1867, when the first constitution was written.&lt;ref&gt;http://ualawccsprod.srv.ualberta.ca/ccs/index.php/constitutional-issues/democratic-governance/739-parliamentary-privilege&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual parliamentary privileges include:
# Freedom of speech
# Freedom from arrest in civil action
# Exemption from jury duty
# Exemption from appearing as a witness
# Freedom from obstruction, interference, intimidation and molestation

Collective parliamentary privileges include:
# Power to discipline
# Regulation of the House's internal affairs
# Management of employees
# Authority to maintain the attendance and service of Members
# Right to institute inquiries and to call witnesses and demand papers
# Right to administer oaths to witnesses
# Right to publish papers containing defamatory material

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has previously dealt with the question of parliamentary privilege in ''[[New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly)]]''.  In that case, the Court made these observations about parliamentary privilege:

''"Privilege" in this context denotes the legal exemption from some duty, burden, attendance or liability to which others are subject. It has long been accepted that in order to perform their functions, legislative bodies require certain privileges relating to the conduct of their business. It has also long been accepted that these privileges must be held absolutely and constitutionally if they are to be effective; the legislative branch of our government must enjoy a certain autonomy which even the Crown and the courts cannot touch.
       
''The privileges attaching to colonial legislatures arose from common law. Modelled on the British Parliament, they were deemed to possess such powers and authority as are necessarily incidental to their proper functioning.  These privileges were  governed by the principle of necessity rather than by historical incident, and thus may not exactly replicate the powers and privileges found in the United Kingdom.''

Recent cases of parliamentary privilege in Canada adjudicated by the courts include:
# 1993: ''New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly)'', where the courts held parliament could restrict who could enter the parliamentary precincts.
# 1999: ''Zundel v. Boudria, et al.'', where the courts held parliament could restrict who could enter the parliamentary precincts.
# 2001: ''Ontario (Speaker of the Legislative Assembly) v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission)'', where the courts held the actions of the provincial legislative assembly were immune from review by other government bodies including the Human Rights Commission.
# 2005: ''Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid'', where the Supreme Court of Canada analyzed the scope of parliamentary privilege and the role of courts in deciding its existence.

==In Australia==
{{Further|Imprisonment of John Drayton|Browne–Fitzpatrick privilege case, 1955}}

In 1904, the [[Parliament of Western Australia]] imprisoned John Drayton for three weeks for a breach of parliamentary privilege.

In 1955, a newspaper proprietor Raymond Fitzpatrick and his editor [[Frank Browne (journalist)|Frank Browne]] were jailed by the [[Australian House of Representatives]] for three months  for what the House considered a gross breach of parliamentary privilege.  The public and most commentators, then and since, felt the punishment far outweighed the crime.

==In South Africa==
[[Helen Suzman]] used parliamentary privilege in her anti-apartheid campaigning.  Helen Suzman reported during a 1994 interview that she was able to get around [[state of emergency]] rules applied against press reporting of violence in the country by asking questions in parliament about the subjects that the press were forbidden from talking about.  South African legislation allowed anything said in parliament to be published in spite of emergency legislation.  She commented on the hypocrisy of anti-apartheid campaigners criticising her for fighting apartheid from the inside in this way, yet publishing information revealed by her by means of parliamentary privilege.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz47Nbz1Sd4][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGY3tvEsQ_E]

==Management of employees==
This privilege was considered in the South Australian Industrial Relations Court in the case of Kosmas v Legislative Council (SA) and Others [2007] SAIRC 86.  The Court found that employment statutes apply to the Parliament and therefore employees can seek judicial relief for matters such as unfair dismissal or workers compensation.

Large numbers of people retweeted the comments and eventually, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] MP [[John Hemming (politician)|John Hemming]] used parliamentary privilege to name Ryan Giggs.  No prosecutions against Twitter users were pursued, firstly because of the impracticality of pursuing things and secondly because of the public outcry about sleazy celebrities using super-injunctions to evade accountability for sleazy behaviour.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4070">The '''Pearl Rating System''' is the [[green building]] rating system developed by the [[Abu Dhabi]] Urban Planning Council as part of their sustainable development initiative, [[Estidama]].  The system can be applied to communities, buildings and villas, with different requirements for each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://estidama.upc.gov.ae/pearl-rating-system-v10.aspx |title=Pearl Rating System |work=Estidama |publisher=Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council |accessdate=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pearl rating system is divided into Buildings, villa, and community. Each with the scale of 1 to 5 pearl.


Similar to [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]], the Pearl Rating System has various levels of certification. ranging from one to five pearls. For all new development projects within the emirate of Abu Dhabi, a minimum certification of one pearl is required (two pearls for government buildings). This certification requirement was mandated by the [[Executive Council of Abu Dhabi]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estidama.org/faqs/general.aspx#4; Executive Council Order]&lt;/ref&gt; and went into effect Autumn 2010.

There are three stages of certification associated with the Pearl Rating System. The first stage is the Pearl Design Rating, success of which is tied to the [[building permit]]. The second stage is the Pearl Construction Rating, success of which is tied to the certificate of completion. The third, and yet to be developed stage, is the Pearl Operations Rating.

Training seminars of various lengths and technical depths are available for all of the Pearl Rating Systems. Training seminars are currently being delivered by the WSP Group&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wspgroup.com/en/WSP-Group/ WSP Group]&lt;/ref&gt; and Oger International&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ogerinternational.com/ Oger International (Abu Dhabi)]&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of the Urban Planning Council,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upc.gov.ae/?lang=en-US Urban Planning Council]&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Dhabi.

Individuals interested in working on Pearl Rated projects should become Pearl Qualified Professionals (PQPs); at least one PQP is required per project planned for development within the emirate of Abu Dhabi. The PQP test was developed by [[Prometric]] and is administered at the CERT center in Abu Dhabi and the AMIDEAST&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amideast.org/uae AMIDEAST]&lt;/ref&gt; testing center in Dubai.

Based on review by Abu Dhabi’s Urban Planning Council (UPC), up to five pearls can be awarded. One pearl is mandatory for all developments and is based on the building code. As per Information Bulletins No. 1 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://estidama.upc.gov.ae/template/estidama/pdf/English%20Bulletins/Information%20Bulletin%201%20Mandate%20for%20Government%20Projects%20rev3.pdf |title=Estidama Pearl Rating System: Information Bulletin #1 ||work=Estidama |publisher=Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council |date=2010-12-06 |accessdate=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; dated 6 December 2010 all Abu Dhabi government projects are required to achieve two pearls. Two pearls include all the mandatory requirements as well as additional optional credits.

To date the only projects to achieve three pearls include the Abu Dhabi Midfield Terminable Building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.adac.ae/english/media-centre/press-releases/2013/2013-09-03-Midfield-Terminal-Building-Receives-Estidama-3-Pearl-Rating.aspx |title=Midfield Terminal Building Receives Estidama 3 Pearl Rating |publisher=Abu Dhabi Airports |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ten unspecified Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.worldgbc.org/activities/news/mena-news/ten-adec-schools-awarded-estidama-3-pearl-rating/ |title=Ten ADEC Schools Awarded Estidama 3 Pearl Rating |publisher=World Green Building Council |date=2013-09-17 |accessdate=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{lang|fr|Peine forte et dure}}''''' ([[Law French]] for "hard and forceful punishment") was a method of [[torture]] formerly used in the [[common law]] legal system, in which a [[defendant]] who refused to [[plea]]d ("stood mute") would be subjected to having heavier and heavier stones placed upon his or her chest until a plea was entered, or he/she died.

Many defendants charged with capital offences would refuse to plead in order to avoid forfeiture of property. If the defendant pleaded either guilty or not guilty and was executed, their heirs would inherit nothing, their property [[escheat]]ing to the Crown. If they refused to plead their heirs would inherit their estate, even if they died in the process.

==Legal background==
[[File:Engraving for the Malefactor's Register the punishment formerly inflicted on those who refused pleading to an indictment.jpg|left|thumb|An engraving of the ''peine forte et dure'' inflicted on a prisoner (appearing in the "[[The Newgate Calendar|Malefactor's register]]" of 1780)]]
The common law courts originally took a very limited view of their own [[jurisdiction]]. They considered themselves to lack jurisdiction over a defendant until he had voluntarily submitted to it by entering a plea seeking judgment from the court.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Frederick Pollock]] and [[Frederic William Maitland]], ''[[The History of English Law]]'', v. 2, pp. 650–651 (Cambridge; 1968; {{ISBN|0-521-07062-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously, a [[criminal justice]] system that could punish only those who had volunteered for possible punishment was unworkable; a means was needed to coerce them into entering a plea.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[William Blackstone]], ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1769), vol. 4, pp. *319-324&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, individuals were frequently tried under [[Admiralty law]], as observed by [[Henry de Bracton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae |url=http://bracton.law.harvard.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Standing Mute Act 1275", part of [[Statute of Westminster 1275|Statute of Westminster of 1275]] of [[Edward I of England]], states:
{{quote|It is provided also, That notorious Felons, which openly be of evil name, and will not put themselves in Enquests of Felonies that Men shall charge them with before the Justices at the King's suit, shall have strong and hard Imprisonment (prison forte et dure), as they which refuse to stand to the common Law of the Land : But this is not to be understood of such prisoners as be taken of light suspicion.&lt;ref name=tyburn&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/tyburntreeitshis00markuoft/tyburntreeitshis00markuoft_djvu.txt "TYBURN TREE: ITS HISTORY AND ANNALS"], Alfred Marks, 1908 ''(at archive.org)''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It appears to have initially meant imprisonment under harsh conditions:
{{quote|in the worst place in the prison, upon the bare ground continually, night and day; that they eat only bread made of barley or bran, and that they drink not the day they eat ...&lt;ref name=tyburn /&gt;}}
By the reign of [[Elizabeth I]] it took the form of "pressing" the accused with weights.&lt;ref name=tyburn /&gt; 
 
The procedure was recorded by a 15th-century witness as follows:
{{quote|he will lie upon his back, with his head covered and his feet, and one arm will be drawn to one quarter of the house with a cord, and the other arm to another quarter, and in the same manner it will be done with his legs; and let there be laid upon his body iron and stone, as much as he can bear, or more ...&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=veURAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=%22laid+in+some+low+dark+house%22#PPA218,M1 Curiosities of Cowell's "Interpreter"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Pressing to death" might take several days, and not necessarily with a continued increase in the load. The Frenchman Guy Miege, who from 1668 taught languages in London,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ed89c430-0517-4065-b717-0243fd11b368 The enterprising and tenacious Guy Miège: four dictionaries from 1677 to 1688]&lt;/ref&gt; says the following about the English practice:&lt;ref&gt;Miege, G.:"[https://books.google.no/books?id=b3gZAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:Pu8Sknlj31oC&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VAMaUeXcJ8jR4QSm1YGoCg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The present state of Great-Britain and Ireland]" London 1715, p.294&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote| For such as stand Mute at their Trial, and refuse to answer Guilty, or Not Guilty, Pressing to Death is the proper Punishment. In such a Case the Prisoner is laid in a low dark Room in the Prison, all naked but his Privy Members, his Back upon the bare Ground his Arms and Legs stretched with Cords, and fastned to the several Quarters of the Room. This done, he has a great Weight of Iron and Stone laid upon him. His Diet, till he dies, is of three Morsels of Barley bread without Drink the next Day; and if he lives beyond it, he has nothing daily, but as much foul Water as he can drink three several Time, and that without any Bread: Which grievous Death some resolute Offenders have chosen, to save their Estates to their Children. But, in case of High Treason, the Criminal's Estate is forfeited to the Sovereign, as in all capital Crimes, notwithstanding his being pressed to Death.}}

''{{lang|fr|Peine forte et dure}}'' was abolished in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1772, with the last known actual use of the practice having been in 1741.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsu.edu/~crimdo/forfeiture.html Drug Control and Asset Seizures: a review of the history of forfeiture in England and colonial America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970428075512/http://www.fsu.edu/~crimdo/forfeiture.html |date=28 April 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1772 refusing to plead was deemed to be equivalent to pleading guilty, but this was changed in 1827 to being deemed a plea of not guilty &amp;ndash; which is now the case in all common law jurisdictions.

==Cases==
[[File:Giles Corey restored.jpg|thumb|[[Giles Corey]] was pressed to death during the [[Salem Witch Trials]] in the 1690s.]]
The most famous case in England was that of [[Roman Catholic]] [[martyr]] [[Margaret Clitherow|St Margaret Clitherow]], who (in order to avoid a trial in which her own children would be obliged to give evidence and could be tortured) was pressed to death on 25 March 1586, after refusing to plead to the charge of having harboured Catholic (then outlawed) [[priest]]s in her house. She died within fifteen minutes under a weight of at least {{convert|700|lb|kg}}. Several hardened criminals, including [[William Spiggot]] (1721) and Edward Burnworth, lasted a half hour under {{convert|400|lb|kg}} before pleading to the indictment. Others, such as Major Strangways (1658) and John Weekes (1731), refused to plead, even under {{convert|400|lb|kg}}, and were killed when bystanders, out of mercy, sat on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/23.2/mckenzie.html|title=Mackenzie, The Practise of Peine Forte et Dure in 16th and 17th Century England|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207082401/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/23.2/mckenzie.html|archivedate=7 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, [[Giles Corey]] was pressed to death between September 17 and September 19, 1692, during the [[Salem witch trials]], after he refused to enter a plea in the judicial proceeding. According to legend, his last words as he was being crushed were "More weight", and he was thought to have been killed as the weight was applied. This is referred to in Arthur Miller's political drama ''[[The Crucible]]'', where Giles Corey is pressed to death after refusing to plead "aye or nay" to the charge of witchcraft. In the film version of this play, the screenplay of which was also by Miller, Corey is crushed to death for refusing to reveal the name of a source of information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4162">In [[international law]], a '''persistent objector''' is a [[sovereign state]] which has consistently and clearly objected to a norm of [[customary international law]] since the norm's emergence, and considers itself not bound to observe the norm. The concept is an example of the [[legal positivism|positivist]] doctrine that a state can only be bound by norms to which it has consented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James A.|last=Green|title=The Persistent Objector Rule in International Law|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2016|isbn=9780198704218|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objection to the emergence of a norm may come in the form of statements declaring a state's position on an existing right, or action in which a state exercises an existing right in the face of an emerging norm which would threaten that right. Statements made at the time of a rule's establishment, such as in a [[reservation (law)|reservation]] to a treaty, offer the clearest expression of a state's objection, but objections might also be expressed during treaty negotiations and even in statements by domestic lawmakers accompanying purely [[municipal law|municipal legislation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1900&amp;context=blr|first=Adam|last=Steinfeld|title=Nuclear Objections: The Persistent Objector and the Legality of the Use of Nuclear Weapons|journal=Brooklyn Law Review|volume=62|pages=1635, 1647|accessdate=19 April 2018|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judicial support for the persistent objector rule is weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Patrick|last=Dumberry|title=Incoherent and Ineffective: The Concept of Persistent Objector Revisited|journal=International and Comparative Law Quarterly|volume=59|page=779|year=2010|ssrn=1653351|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Court of Justice]] has discussed the persistent objector rule in ''[[obitur dictum|dicta]]'' in two cases: the ''[[Asylum case]]'' (''Columbia v Peru'', [1950] ICJ 6) and the ''[[Fisheries case]]'' (''United Kingdom v Norway'', [1951] ICJ 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steinfeld|1996|p=1653}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] rejected an attempted assertion of the persistent objector defence in ''Domingues v United States'' (2002) on the ground that the prohibition against the juvenile death penalty to which the United States objected was not merely customary international law but ''[[jus cogens]]'', a norm from which no derogation was permitted. However, this could also be read as confirming that a persistent objector defence may successfully overcome a norm of [[international human rights law]] which has not attained the status of ''jus cogens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1295&amp;context=cjil|first=Holning|last=Lau|title=Rethinking the Persistent Objector Doctrine in International Human Rights Law|journal=Chicago Journal of International Law|volume=6|pages=495, 496|year=2005|accessdate=19 April 2018|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stronger support for the rule can be found in the writings of certain [[jurists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steinfeld|1996|p=1653}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Law Institute]] was historically a major contributor to developing a "comprehensive theory" of persistent objection through its 1987 ''Third Restatement of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States'', part of its ''[[Restatements of the Law]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dumberry|2010|p=779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition is a simulation of a fictional dispute between countries before the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ). It is named after [[Philip Jessup]], who once served on the ICJ, and is organised by the [[International Law Students Association]]. The moot, under the leadership of [[Stephen Schwebel]] (who also wrote the inaugural moot problem),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsa.org/jessup/50.php|title=International Law Students Association - the future of international law|website=www.ilsa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; started as a friendly advocacy competition between two teams from [[Harvard University]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web|title=1960 Jessup Competition|url=http://www.ilsa.org/jessup/archives/1960.php|website=ilsa.org|publisher=International Law Students Association|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first champions were declared in 1963 and the competition opened its doors to non-American teams in 1968. The current sponsor of the international rounds of the moot is [[White &amp; Case]].

The Jessup moot involves arguing a hypothetical case on issues of [[international law]] as if before the [[International Court of Justice]], but with a smaller complement of judges (three instead of 15). The [[International Law Students Association]] Board is responsible for soliciting and selecting proposals for the ''[[compromis]]'' every year.

Each team comprises two to five student members. Each team must prepare to argue the sides of both the Applicant and Respondent in the case, and must produce a written memorial for each side of the case. In each round, two competitors from a team will argue one side of the case for 45 minutes in total, including any time reserved for rebuttal or sur-rebuttal. A third team member may be seated at the bar table as of-counsel, but may not present argument. There is no fixed team organisation. Some teams dedicate two oralists to each side of the argument, with the fifth person serving a more open-ended role. In other teams, only two or three speakers will present oral argument, with at least one person arguing both Applicant and Respondent sides. In addition, most teams include at least one advisor or coach, usually drawn from the respective universities' international law faculty and/or past Jessup competitors.

Most countries hold national or regional rounds to select the best team or teams to advance to the international phase of the competition in [[Washington D.C.]], which is held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the [[American Society of International Law]]. Generally, each country can only send one school for every ten law schools that participate in the moot. For instance, the United States, which has more than a hundred law schools taking part each year, is represented by up to 12 teams following the conclusion of its six regional rounds, while smaller countries that have only a small number of law schools can only send one team. Domestic round administrators have some autonomy in setting their own rules. In Washington D.C., teams compete in four preliminary rounds, with the top 32 teams advancing to the knockout stages (Round of 32, Octo-final, Quarter-final, Semi-Final, and Final). Each oral round and memorial is usually evaluated by a panel of three judges. Judges for most of the rounds in Washington D.C. are usually practicing lawyers or academics, while notable academics and international judges are usually invited to judge the Semi-Final and Final round matches.

The moot is also marked by additional events such as the Announcement Party where the teams advancing to the knockout stages are declared, and the Go Nation dress ball where the participants from all across the world showcase their national dresses. The final gala and the reverse moot usually mark the end of the competition.

==Past winners and records (international rounds)==
Although the moot was founded in 1960, no winners were declared for the first three editions of the competition. The competition was only first open to countries outside of the United States in 1968, and outside of North America in 1970.&lt;ref name=archives/&gt; The first international awards were handed out in 1972.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2421">'''Post-behavioralism''' (or '''post-behaviouralism''') also known as '''neo-behavioralism''' (or '''neo-behaviouralism''') was a reaction against the dominance of [[behavioralism|behavioralist]] methods in the study of politics. One of the key figures in post-behaviouralist thinking was [[David Easton]] who was originally one of the leading advocates of the "behavioral revolution".&lt;ref&gt; Chaurasia, Radhey (2003) ''History of Political Thought'', New Delhi: Atlantic Publishers, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Post-behavioralists claimed that despite the alleged value-neutrality of behavioralist research it was biased towards the status quo and social preservation rather than social change.

==Key tenets==
*Post-behavioralism challenged the idea that academic research had to be value neutral&lt;ref&gt;Sanford Schram, Brian Caterino, (2006)  ''Making political science matter: debating knowledge, research, and method'', New York: New York University Press, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that values should not be neglected.&lt;ref&gt; Chaurasia, Radhey (2003) ''History of Political Thought'', New Delhi: Atlantic Publishers, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;
*Post-behavioralism claimed that behavioralism's bias towards observable and measurable phenomena meant that too much emphasis was being placed on easily studied trivial issues at the expense of more important topics.&lt;ref&gt;Jay M. Shafritz (2004) ''Dictionary of public policy and administration'', Oxford: Westview Press, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
*Research should be more relevant to society&lt;ref&gt;Chaurasia, Radhey (2003) ''History of Political Thought'', New Delhi: Atlantic Publishers, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; and intellectuals have a positive role to play in society.&lt;ref&gt; Chaurasia, Radhey (2003) ''History of Political Thought'', New Delhi: Atlantic Publishers, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Heinz Eulau described post-behavioralism as a "near hysterical response to political frustrations engendered by the disconcerting and shocking events of the late sixties and early seventies".&lt;ref&gt;Eulau, Heinz (1981).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11572">{{Contract law}}
The '''doctrine of [[privity (law)|privity]] of [[contract law|contract]]''' is a [[common law]] principle which provides that a [[contract]] cannot confer rights or impose obligations upon any person who is not a party to the contract.

The premise is that only parties to contracts should be able to sue to enforce their rights or claim damages as such. However, the doctrine has proven problematic because of its implications upon contracts made for the benefit of third parties who are unable to enforce the obligations of the contracting parties. In the UK, the doctrine has been substantially weakened by the Contracts (Rights of third Parties) Act 1999 creating exceptions to privity of contract.

==Third-party rights==
&lt;!-- Linked to from within [[Caveat emptor]] --&gt;
Privity of contract occurs only between the parties to the contract, most commonly
[[contract of sale]] of goods or services. Horizontal privity arises when the benefits from a contract are to be given to a third party.  Vertical privity involves a contract between two parties, with an independent contract between one of the parties and another individual or company.

If a third party gets a benefit under a contract, it does not have the right to go against the parties to the contract beyond its entitlement to a benefit. An example of this occurs when a manufacturer sells a product to a distributor and the distributor sells the product to a retailer. The retailer then sells the product to a consumer.  There is no privity of contract between the manufacturer and the consumer.

This, however, does not mean that the parties do not have another form of action: for instance, in  ''[[Donoghue v. Stevenson]]''{{spaced ndash}} a friend of Ms. Donoghue bought her a bottle of ginger beer, which contained the partially decomposed remains of a snail. Since the contract was between her friend and the shop owner, Mrs. Donoghue could not sue under the contract, but it was established that the manufacturer was in breach of a [[duty of care]] owed to her. Accordingly, she was awarded damages in the  tort of negligence for having suffered gastroenteritis and "nervous shock".

==History==
Prior to 1861 there existed decisions in English Law allowing provisions of a contract to be enforced by persons not party to it, usually relatives of a promisee, and decisions disallowing third party rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Privity of Contracts: Contracts for the benefits of third parties|publisher=Law Commission| id=LC242| url=http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/docs/lc242_privity_of_contract_for_the_benefit_of_third_parties.pdf|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Drive Yourself Hire Co (London) v Strutt|date=1954|vol=1|reporter=Q.B.|opinion=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine of privity emerged alongside the doctrine of [[consideration]], the rules of which state that consideration must move from the promisee.  That is to say that if nothing is given for the promise of something to be given in return, that promise is not legally binding unless promised as a [[deed]]. 1833 saw the case of ''[[Price v. Easton]]'', where a contract was made for work to be done in exchange for payment to a third party.  When the third party attempted to sue for the payment, he was held to be not privity to the contract, and so his claim failed. This was fully linked to the doctrine of consideration, and established as such, with the more famous case of ''[[Tweddle v. Atkinson]]''.  In this case the plaintiff was unable to sue the executor of his father-in-law, who had promised to the plaintiff's father to make payment to the plaintiff, because he had not provided any consideration to the contract.

The doctrine was developed further in ''[[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre v. Selfridge and Co. Ltd.]]'' through the judgment of Lord Haldane.

Privity of Contract played a key role in the development of negligence as well. In the first case of ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright]]'' (1842), in which Winterbottom, a postal service wagon driver, was injured due to a faulty wheel, attempted to sue the manufacturer Wright for his injuries. The courts however decided that there was no privity of contract between manufacturer and consumer.

This issue appeared repeatedly until ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'' (1916), a case analogous to ''Winterbottom v Wright'' involving a car's defective wheel.  Judge [[Benjamin N. Cardozo|Cardozo]], writing for the [[New York Court of Appeals]], decided that no privity is required when the manufacturer knows the product is probably dangerous if defective, third parties (e.g. consumers) will be harmed because of said defect, and there was no further testing after initial sale. Foreseeable injuries occurred from foreseeable uses. Cardozo's innovation was to decide that the basis for the claim was that it was a tort not a breach of contract. In this way he finessed the problems caused by the doctrine of privity in a modern industrial society. Although his opinion was only law in New York State, the solution he advanced was widely accepted elsewhere and formed the basis of the doctrine of [[product liability]].

==Exceptions==

===Common law exceptions===
There are exceptions to the general rule, allowing rights to third parties and some impositions of obligations. These are:
*Collateral Contracts (between the third party and one of the contracting parties)
*[[Trusts]] (the beneficiary of a trust may sue the trustee to carry out the contract)
*Land Law (restrictive covenants on land are imposed upon subsequent purchasers if the covenant benefits neighbouring land)
*Agency and the [[Assignment (law)|assignment]] of contractual rights are permitted.
*[[Third-party insurance]] - A third party may claim under an insurance policy made for their benefit, even though that party did not pay the premiums.
*[[Contracts for the benefit of a group]]  where a contract to supply a service is made in one person's name but is intended  to sue at common law if the contract is breached; there is no privity of contract between them and the supplier of the service.

Attempts have been made to evade the doctrine by implying trusts (with varying success), constructing the Law of Property Act 1925 s. 56(1) to read the words "other property" as including contractual rights, and applying the concept of restrictive covenants to property other than real property (without success).

# in case of trust/beneficiary 
# in case of family arrangement
# in case of acknowledgment of debts
# in case of assignment of contract.

===Statutory exceptions===
In the United Kingdom, the [[Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999]] provided some reform for this area of law which has been criticised by judges such as Lord Denning and academics as unfair in places. The act states:

: 1. - (1) Subject to the provisions of this act, a person who is not a party to a contract (a "third party") may in his own right enforce a term of the contract if-
:: (a) the contract expressly provides that he may, or
:: (b) subject to subsection (2), the term purports to confer a benefit on him.
: (2) Subsection (1)(b) does not apply if on a proper construction of the contract it appears that the parties did not intend the term to be enforceable by the third party.

This means that a person who is named in the contract as a person authorised to enforce the contract or a person receiving a benefit from the contract may enforce the contract unless it appears that the parties intended that he may not.

The Act enables the aim of the parties to be fully adhered to. In ''[[Beswick v Beswick]]'', the agreement was that Peter Beswick assign his business to his nephew in consideration of the nephew employing him for the rest of his life and then paying a weekly annuity to Mrs. Beswick. Since the latter term was for the benefit of someone not party to the contract, the nephew did not believe it was enforceable and so did not perform it, making only one payment of the agreed weekly amount. Yet the only reason why Mr. Beswick contracted with his nephew was for the benefit of Mrs. Beswick. Under the Act, Mrs. Beswick would be able to enforce the performance of the contract in her own right. Therefore, the Act realises the intentions of the parties.

The law has been welcomed by many as a relief from the strictness of the doctrine, however it may still prove ineffective in professionally drafted documents, as the provisions of this statute may be expressly excluded by the draftsmen.

===Third-party beneficiaries===
In [[Australia]], it has been held that third-party beneficiaries may uphold a promise made for its benefit in a contract of insurance to which it is not a party (''[[Trident General Insurance Co Ltd v. McNiece Bros Pty Ltd]]'' (1988) 165 CLR 107).&lt;ref&gt;High Court of Australia, [http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/44.html Trident General Insurance Co Ltd v McNiece Bros Pty Ltd [1988] HCA 44; (1988) 165 CLR 107 (8 September 1988)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that the decision in ''Trident'' had no clear [[ratio decidendi|ratio]], and did not create a general exemption to the doctrine of privity in Australia.

[[Queensland]], the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Western Australia]] have all enacted statutory provisions to enable third party beneficiaries to enforce contracts, and limited the ability of contracting parties to vary the contract after the third party has relied on it. In addition, section 48 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) allows third-party beneficiaries to enforce contracts of insurance.

Although damages are the usual remedy for the breach of a contract for the benefit of a third party, if damages are inadequate, [[specific performance]] may be granted (''[[Beswick v. Beswick]]'' [1968] AC 59).

The issue of third-party beneficiaries has appeared in cases where a [[stevedore]] has claimed it is covered under the exclusion clauses in a [[bill of lading]]. In order for this to succeed, three factors must be made out:
* The bill of lading must clearly intend to benefit the third party.
* It is clear that when the [[common carrier|carrier]] contracts with the [[consignor]], it also contracts as an [[agency (law)|agent]] of the stevedore. That is, either the carrier must have had authority by the stevedore to act on its behalf, or the stevedore must later ratify (endorse) the actions of the carrier.
* Any difficulties with consideration moving from the stevedores must be made out.

The last issue was explored in ''[[New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v. A M Satterthwaite &amp; Co Ltd]]'' [1975] AC 154, where it was held that the stevedores had provided consideration for the benefit of the exclusion clause by the discharge of goods from the ship.

[[New Zealand]] has enacted the [[Contracts Privity Act 1982]], which enables third parties to sue if they are sufficiently identified as beneficiaries by the contract, and in the contract it is expressed or implied they should be able to enforce this benefit. An example case of not being "sufficiently identified" is that of ''[[Field v Fitton]]'' (1988).

{{Politics of Nepal}}

'''Rastriya Panchayat''' was the official [[legislature|legislature (parliament)]] (parliament) during the [[Panchayat (Nepal)| Panchayat regime]] of [[Nepal]] that effectively functioned from 1960 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url = http://eap.bl.uk/database/overview_item.a4d?catId=57937;r=27644 | title = Endangered Archives}} &lt;/ref&gt; Its head office was at the ''"Gallery Baithak"'' in [[Singha Durbar]], [[Kathmandu]]. In the 1980s, it consisted of more than 120 members among which 105 members were directly elected by the people, while the king was to nominate 20 percent of its members, i.e. 19 members were nominated by the monarch.

The Rastriya Panchayat was dissolved by [[Birendra of Nepal| King Birendra]] after the [[People's Movement I (1990) | People's Movement I in 1990]]&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://www.telegraphnepal.com/headline/2014-02-14/nepal:-ca-body-similar-to-last-rastriya-panchayat-claims-dahal.html| title=Nepal: CA body similar to last Rastriya Panchayat, claims Dahal}} &lt;/ref&gt; and replaced by a [[bicameral legislature]] with a fully elected [[House of Representatives (Nepal)|House of Representatives]] ({{lang-ne|Pratinidhi Sabha}}).

A '''Roman military diploma''' was a document inscribed in bronze certifying that the holder was [[Honesta missio|honourably discharged]] from the Roman armed forces and/or had received the grant of [[Roman citizenship]] from the emperor as reward for service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romancoins.info/MilitaryDiploma1a.html ''Military Diplomas Online: Introduction'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The diploma was a notarised copy of an original ''constitutio'' (decree) issued by the [[Roman emperors|emperor]] in Rome, listing by regiment (or unit) the eligible veterans. The ''constitutio'', recorded on a large bronze plate, was lodged in the military archive at Rome (none such has been found; presumably they were melted down in later times).

== History  ==
[[File:Roman military diploma Carnuntum 00.jpg|thumb|left|Roman military diploma ad 80 (Museum Carnuntum)]]

Diplomas were issued during the [[Principate]] period (52-284 AD) to retiring veterans who had served in those corps of the Roman armed forces which enlisted ''[[Peregrinus (Roman)|peregrini]]'', that is, inhabitants of the Roman empire who were not Roman citizens (the vast majority of the empire's population in the 1st and 2nd centuries). Such corps were: the [[Roman auxiliaries|auxilia]]; [[Roman navy]], the [[Praetorian Guard]]'s cavalry (''[[equites singulares Augusti]]''); and the ''[[cohortes urbanae]]'' (the [[City of Rome]]'s public-order battalions).&lt;ref&gt;Burton (1988) 427&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known diploma dates from AD 52, under emperor [[Claudius]] (r. 41-54), who appears to have regularised the practice of granting Roman citizenship to non-citizen auxiliaries after 25 years' service (26 in the navy).

Diplomas were not normally issued to discharged legionaries, as the [[Roman legion|legion]]s recruited Roman citizens only. However, legionary diplomas were exceptionally issued after the [[Year of the Four Emperors|Civil War of 68/69 AD]]. As an emergency measure, 2 new legions, the ''I'' and ''II Classica'' (later reconstituted and renamed as [[Legio I Adiutrix|I]] and [[Legio II Adiutrix|II Adiutrix]], respectively) were formed mainly from naval marines, many of whom did not hold citizenship. At the end of the crisis, these were all awarded Roman citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romancoins.info/MilitaryDiploma-3a.html''Military Diplomas for Italian Units'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 212, the ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'', issued by the emperor [[Caracalla]], granted Roman citizenship to all the inhabitants of the empire, thus ending the second-class ''peregrini'' status. This made military diplomas largely redundant, and indeed the last known auxiliary diplomas date from AD 203. But diplomas for service in the navy, [[Praetorian Guard]] cavalry and the ''cohortes urbanae'' continued to be issued until the late 3rd century. This might be explained by the fact that ''barbari'' (foreigners from outside the Roman empire) were still recruited for those units.

== Rights granted ==

The veteran was granted Roman citizenship, which carried important legal and fiscal advantages, including exemption from the [[Tax per head|poll tax]] (''tributum capitis'') payable by all non-citizen subjects of the empire. Citizenship was also granted to the veteran's natural children, but not to his female partner. Until ca. 140, all children born to the veteran during his term of service were eligible. After that date, it appears that the grant was restricted to children born after the veteran's discharge (unless the veteran had registered children born before his enlistment). This seemingly retrogressive step has been doubted by some historians, and it is possible that the available evidence is garbled.

Until the time of emperor [[Septimius Severus]] (r. 197-211), serving soldiers were legally prohibited to marry. In practice, many formed stable relationships with local women and brought up families. Diplomas retrospectively regularised such unions by granting the discharged veteran, in addition to citizenship, the right of ''connubium'' ("inter-marriage"), which was necessary as Roman citizens were not legally permitted to marry non-citizens (unless the latter possessed "[[Latin Rights]]").

An exceptional ''constitutio'' of emperor Hadrian (r. 117-38) is known from 3 diplomas, which granted citizenship to the beneficiaries' parents and siblings, in addition to their children.

== Description ==

The diploma consisted of two bronze tablets hinged together. Inscriptions would be engraved on each side of both plates. The full text of a diploma was engraved on the outer side of the so-called tabula 1, while the outer side of tabula 2 displayed the names of 7 witnesses, their seals covered and protected by metal strips (such seals have rarely survived, being of organic material). The text of tabula 1 was reproduced exactly on the two inner sides. The plates would then be folded shut and sealed together, so that the external inscription would be legible without breaking the seals. The internal inscription was the official notarised copy of the text on the ''constitutio'' published in Rome. The double-inscription and seals were presumably to prevent forgery or alteration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romancoins.info/MilitaryDiploma1a.html ''Military Diplomas Online: Introduction'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In a likely scenario, the holder would take the sealed diploma to the province or ''civitas'' (city/county) where he intended to live in retirement. He would then present the diploma to the keeper of archives either at the provincial governor's headquarters (or perhaps at his local ''civitas'' offices). The archivist could break the seals and check that the data on the internal inscription matched the external one. If all was in order, he would then enter the diploma-holder's name onto the register of resident Roman citizens.

== Research significance ==

Over 800 diplomas from the Principate have been found and over 650 published (although the majority have survived in only fragmentary form). This constitutes a rare corpus of Roman documentary material, whose survival is due to their being made of metal, rather than degradable material such as papyrus, wood or wax. A particular advantage of diplomas for historians is that they are dated. The date of the constitution was entered as the year of the emperor's ''tribunicia potestas''; while the date of issue of the notarised copy (diploma) was given as the day of the month and the names of the [[Roman consul|Consuls]] currently in office (resulting in diplomas being an important source for the names of suffect consuls). As these documents also list the name of the provincial governor, they provide valuable data on senators' career-paths. In addition, diplomas usually record the names of several auxiliary units which served in the same province at the same time, as they were normally issued in batches. Thus a single diploma may yield the names of as many as 25 units included in the same constitution,  critical data on the deployment of auxiliary units in the various provinces of the empire at different times. Constitutions are also known just for individual units, even individual veterans.

The following information on the beneficiary was usually recorded in the diploma: beneficiary's regiment, regimental commander's name, beneficiary's military rank, name of beneficiary, name of beneficiary's father and origin (nation, tribe or city); name of beneficiary's wife and name of her father and origin; and names of children granted citizenship.

A '''semi-presidential system''' or '''dual executive system''' is a [[system of government]] in which a [[president]] exists alongside a [[prime minister]] and a cabinet, with the latter being responsible to the legislature of a [[State (polity)|state]]. It differs from a [[parliamentary republic]] in that it has a popularly elected [[Head of state]], who is more than a mostly ceremonial/non executive (the powers, limitations differ in different parliamentary republics, that this type of president would have tend to be 'reserve'/emergency and non partisan in nature), [[figurehead]] (a president in a dual executive system also has political powers), and from the [[presidential system]] in that the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], although named by the president, is [[Individual ministerial responsibility|responsible]] to the [[legislature]], which may force the cabinet to resign through a [[motion of no confidence]].&lt;ref name="Duverger1980"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Duverger|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6765.1980.tb00569.x/epdf |dead-url=no |format=PDF |journal=[[European Journal of Political Research]] |type=quarterly |location=University of Paris I, Paris |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=165–187 |publisher=Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6765.1980.tb00569.x |doi-access=free |via=[[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] Online Library |quote=The concept of a semi-presidential form of government, as used here, is defined only by the content of the constitution.

There is, however, a general consensus that governments in the various countries work quite differently. This is why some authors have inserted distinctive features into their analytical approaches, at the same time maintaining the general dichotomy. Maurice Duverger, trying to explain the French Fifth Republic, found that this dichotomy was not adequate for this purpose. He therefore resorted to the concept of 'semi-presidential government': The characteristics of the concept are (Duverger 1974: 122, 1978: 28, 1980: 166):&lt;br /&gt;1. the President of the Republic is elected by universal suffrage,&lt;br /&gt;2. he possesses quite considerable powers and&lt;br /&gt;3. he has opposite him a prime minister who possesses executive and governmental powers and can stay in office only if parliament does not express its opposition to him. |postscript=. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–1933) exemplified an early semi-presidential system, the term "semi-presidential" was introduced by a 1959 article by journalist [[Hubert Beuve-Méry]]&lt;ref&gt;''Le Monde'', 8 January 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; and popularized by a 1978 work by political scientist [[Maurice Duverger]],&lt;ref name="Duverger1978"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Duverger |first=Maurice |author-link=Maurice Duverger |title=Échec au roi |publisher=A.

There are two separate subtypes of semi-presidentialism: premier-presidentialism and president-parliamentarism.

Under the '''premier-presidential''' system, the Prime Minister and Cabinet are exclusively accountable to Parliament. The President chooses the Prime Minister and Cabinet, but only the Parliament may remove them from office with a ''vote of no confidence''. The President does ''not'' have the right to dismiss the Prime Minister or the Cabinet. However, in some cases, the President can circumvent this limitation by exercising the discretionary power of dissolving the Parliament, which forces the Prime Minister and Cabinet to step down.

Under the '''president-parliamentary''' system, the Prime minister and Cabinet are dually accountable to the President and the Parliament. The President chooses the Prime Minister and the Cabinet but must have the support of the Parliament majority for his choice. In order to remove a Prime Minister or the whole Cabinet from power, the President can dismiss them, or the Parliament can remove them by a ''vote of no confidence''. This form of semi-presidentialism is much closer to pure presidentialism. It is used in [[Guinea-Bissau]],&lt;ref name="Neto2010" /&gt; [[Mozambique]], [[Namibia]], [[Russia]], [[Senegal]]&lt;!-- (since 2001) --&gt; and [[Taiwan]]. It was also used in Ukraine, first between 1996 and 2005, and again from 2010 to 2014, Georgia between 2004 and 2013, and in [[Germany]] during the ''Weimarer Republik'' ([[Weimar Republic]]), as the constitutional regime between 1919 and 1933 is called unofficially.&lt;ref name="Shugart2005-Draft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shugart2005" /&gt;

In the '''parliamentary-presidential''' system the President is appointed by the legislature and is not directly elected by the people. The President is both Head of State and Head of Government; the role of a separate head of government, for example a Prime Minister, does not exist. The members of the cabinet are not members of the Legislative branch.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

== Division of powers ==
The powers that are divided between president and prime minister can vary greatly between countries.

In '''[[France]]''', for example, in case of [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]], when the President and the Prime Minister come from opposing parties, the President oversees [[foreign policy]] and [[defence policy]] (these are generally called ''les prérogatives présidentielles'' (the presidential prerogatives) and the Prime Minister [[domestic policy]] and [[economic policy]].&lt;ref&gt;See article 5, title II, of the [[French Constitution of 1958]]. Jean Massot, [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/documentation-publications/dossiers-thematiques/2008-cinquantenaire-la-constitution-en-20-questions/la-constitution-en-20-questions-question-n-6.17355.html Quelle place la Constitution de 1958 accorde-t-elle au Président de la République?], [[Constitutional Council of France]] website (in French).&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the division of responsibilities between the [[Prime Minister]] and the [[President]] is not explicitly stated in the constitution, but has evolved as a [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|political convention]] based on the constitutional principle that the Prime Minister is appointed (with the subsequent approval of a parliament majority) and dismissed by the President.&lt;ref name="Larousse"&gt;Le Petit Larousse 2013 p. 880&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, whenever the President is from the same party as the Prime Minister who leads the ''conseil de gouvernement'' (cabinet), he/she often (if not usually) exercises ''de facto'' control over '''all''' fields of policy via the Prime Minister. It is up to the President to decide how much "autonomy" is left to "their" Prime Minister to act on their own. &lt;!--

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The incorporation of the elements from both presidential and parliamentary republics brings advantage elements along with them but, however, it also comes with disadvantages related to the confusion about powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLLuWYL8gTsC&amp;pg=PA169|title=Comparative Politics: Structures and Choices|first=Lowell|last=Barrington|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advantages'''
* Providing cover for the president
* Ability to remove an unpopular prime minister and maintain stability from the president's fixed term
* Additional checks and balances; power-sharing executive

'''Disadvantages'''
* Confusion about accountability
* Confusion and inefficiency in legislative process
 --&gt;

== Cohabitation ==
{{Further information|Cohabitation (government)}}
Semi-presidential systems may sometimes experience periods in which the president and the prime minister are from differing political parties. This is called "[[Cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]", a term which originated in France when the situation first arose in the 1980s. Cohabitation can create an effective system of [[Separation of powers|checks and balances]] or a period of bitter and tense stonewalling, depending on the attitudes of the two [[leadership|leaders]], the ideologies of their parties, or the demands of their constituencies.&lt;ref name="JVPoulard1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poulard |first=Jean V. |author-link=&lt;!-- Jean V. Poulard --&gt; |name-list-format=vanc |date=Summer 1990 |title=The French Double Executive and the Experience of Cohabitation |url=http://www.psqonline.org/article.cfm?IDArticle=12601 |access-date=7 October 2017 |url-access=subscription |format=PDF |department= |journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]] |type=quarterly |location=Indiana University Nortwest |publisher=The [[Academy of Political Science]] |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=243–267 |doi=10.2307/2151025 |doi-access=free |doi-broken-date= |issn=0032-3195 |jstor=2151025 |jstor-access=free |oclc=4951242513 |quote= |postscript=. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, cohabitation results from a system in which the two executives are not elected at the same time or for the same term. For example, in 1981, France elected both a [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] president and legislature, which yielded a Socialist premier. But whereas the president's term of office was for seven years, the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] only served for five. When, in the [[French legislative election, 1986|1986 legislative election]], the French people elected a right-of-centre assembly, Socialist President [[Mitterrand]] was forced into cohabitation with rightist premier [[Jacques Chirac]].&lt;ref name="JVPoulard1990" /&gt;

However, in 2000, amendments to the [[French constitution]] reduced the length of the French president's term from seven to five years. This has significantly lowered the chances of cohabitation occurring, as parliamentary and presidential elections may now be conducted within a shorter span of each other.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The incorporation of elements from both presidential and parliamentary republics brings some advantageous elements along with them but, however, it also faces disadvantages related to the confusion from mixed authority patterns.&lt;ref name="Barrington2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barrington |first1=Lowell |author-link1= |last2=Bosia |first2=Michael J. |author-link2= |last3=Bruhn |first3=Kathleen |author-link3= |last4=Giaimo |first4=Susan |author-link4= |last5=McHenry, Jr. |first5=Dean E. |author-link5= |display-authors= |author-mask= |last-author-amp= |date= |year=2012 |orig-year=2009 |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |editor1-link= |display-editors= |title=Comparative Politics: Structures and Choices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLLuWYL8gTsC&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;ots=wWSCGmADla&amp;pg=PA169 |series= |edition=2nd |location=Boston, MA |publisher=[[Cengage Learning|Wadsworth Cenage Learning]] |publication-date= |pages=169–170 |at= |isbn=9781111341930 |lccn=2011942386 |access-date=9 September 2017 |via=[[Google Books]] |quote= |postscript=. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advantages'''
* Providing [[Separation of powers|cover]] for the President — it can shield the President from criticism and the unpopular policies can be blamed on the Prime Minister as the latter runs the day-to-day operations of the government and carrying out the national policy set forth by the President, who is the Head of State that is focusing on being the national leader of a state and in arbitrating the efficiency of government authorities, etc.;
* Ability to remove an unpopular Prime Minister and maintain stability from the President's [[Mandate (politics)|fixed term]] — the Parliament has power to [[Vote of no confidence|remove]] an unpopular prime minister;
* Additional [[Separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] — while the President can dismiss the Prime Minister in most semi-presidential systems, in most of the semi-presidential systems important segments of bureaucracy are taken away from the President.

'''Disadvantages'''
* Confusion about [[accountability]] — parliamentary systems give voters a relatively clear sense of who is responsible for policy successes and failures; presidential systems make this more difficult, particularly when there is divided government. Semi-presidential systems add another layer of complexity for voters;
* Confusion and inefficiency in [[Legislature|legislative process]] — the capacity of [[Vote of no confidence|votes of confidence]] makes the Prime Minister responsible to the parliament.

== Republics with a semi-presidential system of government ==
{{main article|List of countries by system of government#Semi-presidential systems}}
In semi-presidential systems, there is always both a president and a prime minister. In such systems, the president has genuine executive authority, unlike in a parliamentary republic, but the role of a head of government may be exercised by the [[prime minister]]. ''Italics'' indicate states with limited recognition.

=== Premier-presidential systems ===
The president chooses the prime minister and cabinet, but only the parliament may remove them from office with a ''vote of no confidence''. The president does not have the power to dismiss the prime minister or the cabinet which are chosen by the parliament. The president does not have the power to directly dismiss the assembly, but the presidentially appointed cabinet does.

The president chooses the prime minister without the [[confidence vote]] from the parliament. In order to remove a prime minister or the whole cabinet from power, the president can dismiss the prime minister or the assembly can remove the prime minister by a ''vote of no confidence'', but the president can dissolve the parliament.

A [[company register]] has a different purpose: protection, accountability and control of legal entities.

== Register contents ==

=== Data sources ===

Countries use whatever data sources they seem relevant. E.g. they often integrate a [[company register]] in one form or another.

=== Type of business units ===
In EU a corresponding regulation define register contents:

* all enterprises carrying on [[Types of business entity|economic activities]] contributing to the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), and their local units
* the legal units of which those enterprises consist
* enterprise groups

=== Characteristics ===

* identification properties
** identification number
** name
** address
** contact info
** VAT number
* dates of creation/liquidation
* main activity
* operational status
* legal form
* links to other registries
* links to other organizations or structural units
* control
* ownership

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6569">'''Texas House Bill 588''', commonly referred to as the "Top 10% Rule", is a [[Texas]] law passed in 1997. It was signed into law by then governor [[George W. Bush]] on May 20, 1997.

The law guarantees Texas students who graduated in the top ten percent of their [[high school]] class automatic admission to all state-funded universities.  The bill was created as a means to avoid the stipulations from the ''[[Hopwood v. Texas]]'' appeals court case banning the use of affirmative action.  The Supreme Court ruled in [[Grutter v. Bollinger]] (2003) that affirmative action in college admissions was permissible, effectively overruling ''Hopwood''.  UT Austin then reinstated affirmative action for the seats not filled by the Top Ten Percent law.

The law only guarantees ''admission'' into university.  Students must still find the means to pay, and may not achieve their desired choice of major. (Another existing law, which preceded 588, provides a full tuition scholarship for the class [[valedictorian]] of a Texas high school for their freshman year at a state public school.)

The Texas "Top 10% Plan" is a transition from a race based policy known as affirmative action. Under a policy such as Texas' Top 10% plan, it is believed that student enrollment for minority students specifically would follow a mismatch hypothesis. This hypothesis predicts that the rates of minority students graduation and retention would improve under the newly established plan in opposition to affirmative action. This mismatch theory would be a result of students finding a university that is a better match for them academically, rather than overreaching and becoming overshadowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalena|first1=Cortes|title=Kalena E. Cortes, Syracuse University Do Bans on Affirmative Action Hurt Minority Students? Evidence from the Texas Top 10% Plan|journal=Article in Economics of Education Review|date=May 2010|pages=1110-1124|doi=10.17848/wp10-168}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The law has drawn praise and criticism alike. Supporters of the rule argue that it ensures geographic and ethnic diversity in public universities. They also point out that students admitted under the legislation performed better in college than their counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.palestineherald.com/local/local_story_016030332.html|title=‘Top 10 percent rule’ on session agenda|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910144037/http://www.palestineherald.com/local/local_story_016030332.html|archivedate=2012-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law has been blamed for keeping students not in the top ten percent but with other credentials, such as high [[Scholastic Aptitude Test|SAT]] scores or leadership and extracurricular experience, out of the larger "flagship" state universities, such as the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A&amp;M University, College Station]]. UT-Austin has argued for several years that the law has come to account for too many of its entering students, with 81 percent of the 2008 freshmen having enrolled under it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesman.com/search/content/test/0526topten_FN.html "House moves to scale back top 10 percent rule", Ralph K.M. Haurwitz, Austin American-Statesman, May 26, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some administrators, such as former University of Texas at Austin President [[Larry Faulkner]], have advocated capping the number of top ten percent students for any year at one half of the incoming class.  Others have suggested a move to a top seven percent law. However, until May 2009 the [[Texas Legislature]] had not revised the law in any way since its inception. A 2007 measure (HB78) was introduced during the 80th Regular Session (2007) but never made it out of committee.

Under legislation approved in May 2009 by the Texas House as part of the [[Eighty-first Texas Legislature|81st Regular Session]] (Senate Bill 175), UT-Austin (but no other state universities) was allowed to trim the number of students it accepts under the 10% rule; UT-Austin could limit those students to 75 percent of entering in-state freshmen from Texas. The University would admit the top 1 percent, the top 2 percent and so forth until the cap is reached, beginning with the 2011 entering class. [[University of Texas System|UT System]] Chancellor [[Francisco G. Cigarroa|Francisco Cigarroa]] and UT-Austin President [[William C. Powers|William Powers Jr.]] had sought a cap of about 50 percent, but lawmakers (led by Representatives [[Dan Branch]] (R-Dallas) and Rep. [[Mike Villarreal]] (D-San Antonio)) brokered the compromise.

A study in 2011 found that the law created a [[perverse incentive]] for students to transfer to a high school with lower-achieving peers, in order to graduate in that school's top percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cullen |first=Julie Berry |last2=Long |first2=Mark C. |last3=Reback |first3=Randall |year=2011 |title=Jockeying for Position: Strategic High School Choice Under Texas' Top Ten Percent Plan |periodical=NBER Working Paper 16663 |url=http://papers.nber.org/papers/w16663 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Conscientious Objector''''' is a 2004 documentary film about the life of [[Desmond Doss]], a [[conscientious objector]] who received a [[Medal of Honor]] for his service in [[World War Two]]. His faith, [[Seventh-day Adventism]], did not permit him to carry a weapon. He initially faced opposition, persecution, and ridicule from his fellow soldiers but ultimately won their admiration by demonstrating courage and saving lives as a [[combat medic]].

The Oscar-nominated movie, ''[[Hacksaw Ridge]]'', was released in 2016 and is a dramatized account of Doss' life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5822">'''Thomas McCaul''' (January 18, 1838 &amp;ndash; October 24, 1926) was an [[United States|American]] merchant, contractor and insurance agent from [[Tomah, Wisconsin|Tomah]], [[Wisconsin]] who served one term as a member of the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/pubs/ib/99ib1.pdf "Members of the Wisconsin Legislature 1848&amp;ndash;1999 State of Wisconsin Legislative Bureau.

During the [[American Civil War]], he was a member of the [[1st United States Sharpshooters]].

== Background ==
McCaul was born in [[New York City]] on January 18, 1838; he received a common school education.  He came to Wisconsin with his father and stepmother in 1855; they settled in [[Fox Lake, Wisconsin|Fox Lake]]. He became a farmer and merchant. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he enlisted in the [[2nd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] but was discharged at [[Camp Randall]] "for injuries received" (presumably during [[basic training|training]]. He re-enlisted in 1861 as a private in Company G of the 1st United States Sharpshooters (better known as Berdan's U. S Sharpshooters}. He participated in several battles, from the [[Siege of Yorktown (1862)]] to [[Battle of Glendale|the Battle of Charles City Crossroads]] (he was [[brevet (military)|brevetted]] [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] by [[Governor of Wisconsin]] [[Lucius Fairchild]] "in recognition of gallant and meritorious conduct in rallying retreating troops" at this battle) to the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]]. (He also briefly went [[absent without leave]] in order to smuggle the body of a fellow Fox Lake soldier back home for burial; then returned to his unit.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Charles Augustus. ''Berdan's United States Sharpshooters in the Army of the Potomac, 1861-1865'' St. Paul: Price-McGill Company, 1892; p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;) At Bull Run he was wounded in the hip and shoulder, and lost his hearing in the right ear, as a result of which he was discharged from the service in 1863. He became a civilian employee of the [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster Department]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1864, and served at [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]] during [[Red Cloud's War]].

== In Tomah ==
McCaul moved to Tomah in 1868, and held various local offices. In 1873, he was elected to the 2nd [[Monroe County, Wisconsin|Monroe County]] Assembly district as a member of the [[Reform Party (19th-century Wisconsin)|Liberal Reform Party]] (a recently formed  [[coalition]] of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], [[reform]] and [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grangers]]  which secured the election of one [[Governor of Wisconsin]] and a number of state legislators) for a one-year term. He received 592 votes, against 513 for Republican Joseph Winship, and 178 for "Independent Republican" John F. Richards; incumbent Republican [[Adelbert Bleekman]] was not a candidate. He listed himself in the ''[[Wisconsin Blue Book]]'' as a "Lib. Republican"; and was assigned to the [[standing committee]] on the [[militia (United States)|militia]] and the [[joint committee]] on [[special legislation|local legislation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1874 Turner, A.

Jackson]].

== After the Assembly ==
In 1883, after Tomah became a city, he was elected its first mayor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16433">{{Politics of Liberia}}
The '''Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission''' (TRC) is a [[Legislature of Liberia|Parliament]]-enacted organization created in May 2005 under the Transitional Government. The Commission worked throughout the first mandate of [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] after her election as President of Liberia in November 2005.  The Liberian TRC came to a conclusion in 2010, filing a final report and recommending relevant actions by national authorities to ensure responsibility and reparations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/AfricaRegion/Pages/LRSummary1011.aspx Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberian TRC has garnered much criticism for its inability to address Charles Taylor and [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]]. The [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] indicted [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]], the leader of the rebel group the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] that many of the crimes against humanity are attributed. This indictment prevented the Liberian TRC from hearing any testimony from Taylor. Sirleaf, on the other hand, was placed on a list of persons that should be barred from public office, a ruling which was later overturned by the [[Liberian Supreme Court]].

==Creation and mandate==
The Liberian TRC's mandate was to "promote national peace, security, unity and reconciliation" by investigating more than 20 years of civil conflict in the country and to report on gross [[human rights]] violations that occurred in [[Liberia]] between January 1979 and 14 October 2003. "Violations" are defined as violations of international human rights standards, [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crime]]s, and any breaches of the [[Geneva Conventions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/vwTreatiesByCountrySelected.xsp?xp_countrySelected=LR Treaties and States Parties to such Treaties]&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the Liberian TRC was to dispel falsifications and misconceptions of the country's past socioeconomic and political development.  The TRC also strove to provide a forum to address issues of impunity and allow victims and perpetrators of human rights violations to share their experiences, thereby creating a clear picture of the past and facilitate genuine healing and reconciliation.  To this end, the Liberian TRC was granted full independence from the Liberian government, to prevent potential biases among the commissioners and other TRC employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/sites/default/files/ICTJ-Liberia-Beyond-TRC-2010-English.pdf Beyond the Truth and Reconciliation Commission: Transitional Justice Options in Liberia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberian TRC was given full power to investigate gross human rights violations and systematic abuses of power in Liberia and, when possible, to identify individuals or groups that perpetrated these violations and to ensure accountability.  The Liberian government took extensive measures to allow the TRC to gather information and create a thorough final report.  Unlike the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|South African TRC]], the Liberian TRC only had the ability to recommend candidates for [[amnesty]] to the Liberian government.  The Liberian TRC could also make suggestions to the Liberian government regarding reparation and rehabilitation for victims; legal, institutional, or other reforms; the need for further investigation and inquiries into certain matters; and the need to hold prosecutions in particular cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trcofliberia.org/about/trc-mandate Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia Mandate]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissioners==
The government of Liberia appointed 10 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trcofliberia.org/about/commissioners Meet The Commissioners]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jerome Verdier|Jerome J. Verdier]], chairperson
* [[Dede Dolopei]], vice chairperson
* [[Oumu Syllah|Oumu K. Syllah]], treasurer
* Bishop [[Arthur Kulah|Arthur F. Kulah]]
* Sheikh [[Kafumba Konneh|Kafumba F. Konneh]]
* [[Pearl Brown Bull]]
* [[Gerald Coleman (Liberia)|Gerald B. Coleman]]
* [[John H. T. Stewart]]
* [[Massa Washington]]
* [[Henrietta Joy Abena Mensa Bonsu]]

==The Final Report==
The Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was released on 1 July 2009. The Final Report summed nearly 400 pages and entailed the mandate of the TRC, the methodology used in its finding, the background of the conflict in Liberia, a summary of its process of collecting information, reports of its findings, and finally its recommendations to prevent atrocities like those carried out by Charles Taylor and Prince Johnson.  The Final Report took into account over 20,000 individual statements from Liberia, the United States, Nigeria, Europe, and Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/liberia-trc-rpt-071409.html Statement By The Carter Center on the Release of the Final Report of Liberia's Truth and Reconciliation Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final report dealt with the problems facing post civil war Liberia in two steps.  The first determination of the Liberian TRC was a list of recommendations to the Liberian government for reparations to victims of the civil wars and reforms to prevent atrocities from reoccurring, and the second was a list of  names of people who required additional investigation or were found to be deserving of amnesty.  The Liberian TRC made a total of 47 recommendations to the Liberian government ranging from establishing national culture centers to promote Liberia's diverse culture to ensuring that perpetrators of gross violations of human right pay reparations to victims.  The TRC made suggestions to ensure that victims of the Liberian Civil Wars received appropriate compensation and that perpetrators saw some form of punishment.  They additionally suggested that resources and infrastructure be made available to settle any lasting problems or conflicts.  The TRC recommended no blanket amnesty, but rather asked amnesty for those under the age of 18 when fighting and those that did not break any humanitarian laws.  To the government, the TRC recommended many reformations to cultural systems in place including alteration of the national motto, a reduction of the number of political parties, enhanced regulation on political appointments, and an alteration of the official Liberian calendar to include holidays from multiple ethnic groups.  Broadly, the Liberian TRC propositioned that the Liberian government promote a culture of respect for human rights, ensure the protection of women and children, and decentralize the Liberian government's power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/final_report A House with Two Rooms: Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia Diaspora Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the recommended policy changes, the TRC provided seven lists of persons or groups requiring extra investigation or deserving of amnesty.  The final report listed 57 people or entities recommended for further investigation; 19 corporations, institutions, and state actors responsible for committing economic crime; 21 individuals for committing economic crime; 98 of the most notorious people that committed gross human rights violations; the eight leaders of the warring factions; and, lastly, a list of 50 persons recommended for sanctions.  The TRC recommended that all individuals and entities noted as most notorious or requiring further investigation have a formal trial in the Liberian justice system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trcofliberia.org/reports/final-report The Truth and Reconciliation of Liberia Final Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the list of persons that should be "specifically barred from holding public offices; elected or appointed for a period of thirty (30) years" for "being associated with former warring factions" was Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the current president of Liberia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trcofliberia.org/reports/final/volume-two_layout-1.pdf Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia Final Report Volume II] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031020702/http://www.trcofliberia.org/reports/final/volume-two_layout-1.pdf/ |date=2010-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 July, Sirleaf apologized to Liberia for supporting Charles Taylor, adding that "when the true nature of Mr. Taylor's intentions became known, there was no more impassioned critic or strong opponent to him in a democratic process" than she.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/world/africa/14diplo.html?hpw Clinton Supports President of Liberia], New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 August Liberia's parliament announced they must "consult our constituents for about a year" before deciding whether or not to implement the Commission's recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601116&amp;sid=aIqClsvAY9T0 Liberian Parliament Delay Action on Truth Commission Findings], Bloomberg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charles Taylor debate==
Charles Taylor was a radical revolutionary in Liberia during the [[first Liberian Civil War]] and, after the death of [[Samuel Doe]], was elected president of Liberia in 1997.  During Taylor's rise to power and during his term as president, however, he carried out multiple atrocities against both the Liberian people and the people of Sierra Leone, grossly violating international humanitarian laws.  After the [[second Liberian Civil War]] and Taylor's fall from power in 2003, the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone|SCSL]] issued an indictment for Taylor's supposed involvement in the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]].  Through the SCSL, Charles Taylor faced trial in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=w8eJkzv303w%3d&amp;tabid=53 Trial Chamber Dismisses Motion for Judgment of Acquittal, Orders Taylor Defence to Open on June 29]&lt;/ref&gt; receiving a guilty verdict on all charges on 26 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=by3HPDDiFTM%3d&amp;tabid=53 Charles Taylor Convicted on all 11 Counts; Sentencing Scheduled for 30 May]&lt;/ref&gt;

While Charles Taylor did face prosecution and punishment through the SCSL, many are now criticizing the Liberian TRC for not having access to hear Taylor's testimony.  Without Charles Taylor's version of Liberia's Civil Wars, the rewriting of Liberia's history is arguably incomplete, leaving the Liberian people vague as to the role he actually played in the humanitarian violations in Liberia.  [[Priscilla Hayner]], the a co-founder of the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]], established three guidelines that Truth and Reconciliation Commissions should follow to ensure due process: the accused should be notified of the allegations held against them, they should be given the opportunity to respond to the charges, and the TRC should make clear in their final report that their findings on individual responsibility do not amount to criminal guilt.  Because the Liberian government handed Charles Taylor over to the SCSL, they, and the Liberian TRC, lost access to Taylor, preventing him from testifying before the TRC and preventing a full truth of the events in Liberia from being constructed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.upenn.edu/cf/faculty/msirleaf/workingpapers/Matiangai%20Sirleaf%20FJIL%20Article.pdf Regional Approach to Transitional Justice?: Examining the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission for Liberia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The Liberian TRC impact locally was minimal.  In January 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Liberia|Supreme Court]] ruled in ''Williams v. Tah'', a case brought by one of the people listed to be barred from public office in the TRC report.  Their ruling stated that the TRC's recommendation on who should be allowed to hold office was an unconstitutional violation of the listed individuals' right to [[procedural due process]], and that it would be unconstitutional for the government to implement the proposed bans.  This decimated a large portion of the TRC's recommendations, allowing people that perpetrated or aided in gross human rights violations to remain in power in Liberia.  Additionally, the other recommendations that the TRC made have not been followed, lowering the local impact to essentially none.  Even though the government has not instituted the recommendations made by the TRC, 73% of Liberians had heard of the TRC and 62% believed their proposed changes should be implemented.  However, only 39% of Liberians believed that the TRC actually helped promote peace and unity in Liberia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usip.org/publications/truth-commission-liberia United States Institute of Peace]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Liberian TRC did not drastically alter the political situation in Liberia, it did take steps in the truth and reconciliation process that other TRCs had not taken.  The TRC worked with The Advocates for Human Rights, a U.S. based organization to help promote Liberian diaspora communities in the TRC's work, the first time a TRC had gathered statements and hearings in this method.  These diaspora communities allowed the TRC to gather statements from the refugees that had fled during the Liberian Civil Wars.  The Liberian TRC also broke new ground in recommending prosecution of groups that committed economic crimes.  These crimes ranged from tax evasion to aiding and abetting war crimes.  Even though the TRC did not have its suggestions enacted by the Liberian government, the steps they took in the truth and reconciliation community will likely be taken into consideration by Truth and Reconciliation Commissions in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12142-013-0268-0 A Search for Truth: A Critical Analysis of the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
The Liberian TRC has faced much criticism for a variety of reasons. Critics have claimed that the TRC lacked adequate funding, competent staff, and sufficient infrastructure. The government's failure to follow through on the recommendations made by the TRC has reflected poorly on the Liberian Truth Commission's image. In 2008, [[Amnesty International]] criticized the TRC's inability to publicize its policies on reparation and prosecution, as well as the commission's policies on protection for victims, lack of general amnesty for those that provide information, and inability to provide individual reparations.  The TRC also ran past its indicated period of activity, which caused the final hearings and the report to be rushed to meet the mandated deadline.  This hurriedness caused a disconnect between the names recommended for prosecution or to be barred from office and their specific crimes along with a general lack of evidence to support the claims made by the TRC.  The Liberian TRC's lack of power has been pointed out and further demonstrated by the Liberian government failing to enact any of their recommendations.  Beyond having its recommendations ignored, the list of individuals recommended to be barred from office was found unconstitutional by the Liberian government.  This ruling allowed President Sirleaf, who was recommended to be barred from office, to remain in power, garnering much international criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaiptc.org/Publications/Occasional-Papers/Documents/Occasional-Paper-33-Jaye-and-Aning.aspx Liberia: A Briefing Paper on the TRC Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''United States v. Arnold''''', 533 [[F.3d]] 1003 (9th Cir. 2008), is a United States court case in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] held that the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] does not require government agents to have [[reasonable suspicion]] before searching [[laptop]]s or other digital devices at the border, including international airports.&lt;ref name="Arnold_opinion"&gt;''United States v. Arnold'', 523 [[F.3d]] [https://www.leagle.com/decision/20081464523f3d94111367 941] (9th Cir. 2008), amended on denial of rehearing [[en banc]], 533 [[F.3d]] [https://www.leagle.com/decision/20081536533f3d100311433 1003] (9th Cir. 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

This decision has caused worry and some controversy among Fourth Amendment advocates, such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. Especially troubled are those that legitimately store sensitive business, legal, or customer data; who worry that federal agents might leak information found from laptop searches. Several legislators have discussed and introduced measures to counter the ruling in order to provide more protection to travellers, but none have become law.

==Background to the case==
On July 17, 2005, Michael Arnold arrived at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX) after spending a three-week vacation in the [[Philippines]]. After retrieving his luggage, Arnold proceeded through the checkpoint at [[customs]]. [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) Officer Laura Peng saw Arnold waiting in line and selected him for secondary questioning.

Peng questioned Arnold, and began inspecting his luggage, noting a laptop computer and several computer accessories. Peng instructed Arnold to turn on the computer so she could see if it was functioning. CBP Officer John Roberts was called to assist with the inspection while the computer was [[booting]] up.

Among the [[Icon (computing)|icons]] displayed on the computer's [[Desktop environment|desktop]], two were named "[[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] Pictures" and one was named "Kodak Memories". Peng and Roberts opened these folders, began viewing the photos, and noted one that depicted two nude women. At that point special agents from [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]], [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) were called. Arnold was detained and questioned by the ICE agents for several hours. They further examined the computer and equipment, and found numerous images of what they believed to be [[child pornography]].

Arnold was released, but his computer was seized by the agents. Federal agents obtained a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] two weeks later. Arnold was charged with (1) knowingly transporting child pornography,&lt;ref name="section_2256"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2256-#FN-1REF 18 U.S.C. Section 2256(8)(A)].&lt;/ref&gt; (2) knowingly possessing a computer hard drive and compact discs which both contained more than one image of child pornography,&lt;ref name="section_2256" /&gt; and (3) knowingly and intentionally traveling in foreign commerce and attempting to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a person under 18 years of age.&lt;ref name="section_2423_f"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2423- 18 U.S.C. Section 2423(f)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="section_2423_c"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2423- 18 U.S.C. Section 2423(c)] .&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold filed for a motion to suppress, and argued that the government required [[reasonable suspicion]] to conduct the search. This motion was granted by the District Court, ruling in Arnold's favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Arnold |vol=454 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=999 |pinpoint= |court=C.D. Cal. |date=2006 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/20061453454fsupp2d99911381 |accessdate=2018-02-12 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government promptly appealed the case, and stated that the [[Border search exception|border doctrine]] took precedence over the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]'s protection from unreasonable search. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the lower court's ruling, holding in favor of the Government.  Arnold was represented in the District Court and before the Ninth Circuit by Marilyn E. Bednarski and Kevin J. LaHue, of Kaye, McLane, Bednarski, &amp; Litt.

==Arguments==

===Reasonable search===
The crux of Arnold's argument is that a laptop is very similar to a person's home and the human mind, much more so than an ordinary container for data. His argument is based on the notion that a laptop has the ability to store a greater amount of data and personal documents, much like those stored in one's home. He continued to argue that because a laptop is able to record ideas, [[e-mail]], [[online chat|internet chats]], and web-surfing habits,  it is very similar to the "human mind." Under these arguments he sought the protection of the Fourth Amendment, which states that "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated ... ".&lt;ref name="Arnold_opinion" /&gt;

Arnold also raised the exception that the government's searches are limited in cases where they are of a "particularly offensive manner,"  and argued that such was the case when CBP officers seized and searched his laptop.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed an [[Amicus curiae|amicus]] brief in support of Arnold.&lt;ref name="amicus_brief"&gt;EFF, [https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/US_v_arnold/arnold_amicus.pdf Amicus brief in United States v. Arnold].&lt;/ref&gt; The amici included the EFF and the [[Association of Corporate Travel Executives]] (ACTE). The brief argued that the government's position and current practice subjects travelers to unconstitutional invasive searches of laptops and other devices. Their argument is similar to that already made by Arnold, and they contended mainly that a computer is different from a gas tank, suitcase, or other closed container because laptops routinely contain some of the most personal information about a person's life. Moreover, the amici were concerned that a search would reveal information that is already protected under other statutes, including [[Attorney–client privilege|privileged legal communications]], reporters' notes from confidential [[Journalism sourcing|sources]], and [[trade secret]]s.

In summary, the main points of the brief are that: (1) people have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information stored on their laptop computers; (2) searches of personal electronic information devices  ... are particularly invasive of personal privacy; (3) the volume of information stored on computers means that the privacy invasion of a laptop border search is enormous; (4) personal computers often contain information that the individual does not know about, or has even sought to erase; (5) laptop computer searches are indistinguishable from "general searches;" (6) there is a real risk of unconstrained "pretext" searches; and (7) the first amendment protects many of the contents on laptop computers.&lt;ref name="amicus_brief" /&gt; The final point raised the worry that indiscriminate searches of information stored on laptops will discourage people from storing sensitive data, thus causing a chilling effect on speech.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A personal computer is among a person's most private belongings. Laptop computers are virtual extensions of the mind, used to record and share our thoughts, feelings, and activities; indeed, "they are postal services, playgrounds, jukeboxes, dating services, movie theaters, daily planners, shopping malls, personal secretaries, virtual diaries, and more."  ... [a]s  a result, our laptop computers contain as much information about us as our homes contain - perhaps more.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Overall, the amici were concerned that unchecked compliance with the border doctrine would infringe too far on a citizen's First and Fourth Amendment rights. In their view, the doctrine did not provide the protection that it was meant to enact, as technology now provides ways to maneuver around it. " ... a smuggler's 'container of choice' for electronic contraband is the internet. They may simply email it to themselves or post it online to avoid customs searches. A ruling that overturns the decision would not undermine the government's ability to protect its borders."&lt;ref name="amicus_brief" /&gt;

===Border doctrine===
{{main|Border search exception}}
In response to Arnold's motion to suppress, the government argued two points. Firstly, the Fourth Amendment did not require reasonable suspicion because of the border doctrine. Secondly, even if reasonable suspicion were required, it was present.

The government argued that the United States has a duty to take measures to ensure the safety of its interior. Past cases have stated that "it is axiomatic that the United States, as sovereign, has the inherent authority to protect, and a paramount interest in protecting, its territorial integrity." In ''United States v. Ramsey'', the court stated that "searches made at the border ... are reasonable simply by virtue of the fact that they occur at the border ... " &lt;ref name="US_v_Ramsey"&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. Ramsey|link=United States v. Ramsey (1977)|volume=431|page=606|pin=|year=1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Arnold, the point that linked these two conclusions together was the notion that international American airports are the functional equivalent of a border, as stated in ''Almeida-Sanchez v. United States''.&lt;ref name="AlmeidaSanchez_v_US"&gt;{{ussc|name=Almeida-Sanchez v. United States|volume=413|page=266|pin=|year=1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reference was also made to a history of searches of closed containers such as a briefcases, purses, wallets, pockets, pictures, film, and other graphic material. These items are the equivalent of a closed container, and have traditionally been searched at the border without particularized suspicion. It is acknowledged that some limits have been made, specifically a traveler's alimentary canal. Such limitations are made when searching a person, not their objects in possession, in the interest of human dignity and privacy, which the Fourth Amendment protects.

==Judgment==

===Reasonable search===
The Court addressed the argument that the search of Arnold's laptop was carried out in a particularly offensive manner, and was so destructive that it required particularized suspicion. The court acknowledged that there was no precedent to declare when a border search should be deemed unreasonable. The Supreme Court has left open the question of the circumstances that make a search particularly offensive, and thus unreasonable. However, the Court pointed out that Arnold never claimed that his laptop was damaged in any way during the government's search.&lt;ref name="Arnold_opinion" /&gt;

Even without a clear scale to determine how offensive a search may be, the Court dismissed the reasoning of the District Court that particularized suspicion was needed in the case of Arnold. The District Court-based this decision on previous cases that related to search of the human body, not of property.

===Border doctrine===
The Court distinguished searches at American airports because they are considered border searches, and occur at the "functional equivalent of a border".&lt;ref name="Arnold_opinion" /&gt; Previously, the Supreme Court had stated that:

{{quote|The authority of the United States to search the baggage of arriving international travelers is based on its inherent sovereign authority to protect its territorial integrity. By reason of that authority, it is entitled to require that whoever seeks entry must establish the right to enter and to bring into the country whatever he may carry ... |''Torres v. Puerto Rico'', 442 U.S. 465, 472-73 (1979).}}

To address Arnold's claim that a laptop is like a home, and therefore requires Fourth Amendment protection, the court dismissed his argument as without merit. Its decision is based on previous Supreme Court judgments that have denied Fourth Amendment protections to property which is also "capable of functioning as a home." &lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=California v. Carney|volume=471|page=386|pin=393|year=1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, the Court addressed a comparison to ''United States v. Ickes'', 393 F.3d 501 (4th Cir. 2005).&lt;ref name=Ickes&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Ickes |vol=393 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=501 |pinpoint= |court=4th Cir. |date=2005 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/393/501/545268/ |accessdate=2018-02-12 |quote=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, a man's van was stopped and searched as he was driving from Canada into the United States. The court upheld the border search doctrine, and the Ninth Circuit acknowledged the concerns and followed the reasoning that carving out a First Amendment exception to the border doctrine would (1) protect terrorist communications "which are inherently 'expressive'"; (2) create an unworkable standard for government agents who "would have to decide - on their feet - which expressive material is covered by the First Amendment"; and (3) contravene the weight of Supreme Court precedent refusing to subject government action to greater scrutiny with respect to the Fourth Amendment when an alleged First Amendment interest is also at stake."

By this reasoning, the Court justified the government's interest in preventing unwanted persons and effects as greater than a person's desire to conceal the contents of their baggage. The decision of the District Court was overturned, ruling in favor of the government.

== Subsequent developments ==

=== Death of Arnold ===
On February 23, 2009, the Supreme Court of the United States notified Arnold's counsel that it had denied Arnold's petition for writ of [[certiorari]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/08-6708.htm Docket for 08-6708 ''Arnold v. United States'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Attorneys for Arnold filed a motion to de-publish the Ninth Circuit opinion (which was denied).&lt;ref name=MotionToDepublish&gt;''United States v. Arnold'', [http://sharealike.org/wp-content/uploads/sharealike/2009/03/arnold_motion_to_depublish.pdf Appellee Arnold's Motion to De-Publish Opinion] (Mar. 3, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  In their motion, Arnold's counsel explained that two days after being informed of the Supreme Court's refusal to hear his appeal, Arnold committed suicide.&lt;ref name=MotionToDepublish /&gt;

=== Controversy ===
This ruling has caused much controversy and discussion among First and Fourth Amendment rights activists, including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] &lt;ref name="ACLU"&gt;ACLU, ''[https://www.aclu.org/privacy/gen/36951prs20080929.html ACLU Welcomes Introduction of Travelers' Privacy Protection Act in Both Chambers of Congress]'' (Sep. 29, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;[https://www.eff.org/cases/us-v-arnold Electronic Frontier Foundation: US v. Arnold]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the primary points of controversy is the court's ruling that a laptop is no different from any other type of container. Just as Arnold has argued, critics argue that a laptop contains far more sensitive and personal data than any ordinary container. They continue to state that a laptop search is so revealing and invasive that the Fourth Amendment requires agents to have some reasonable suspicion to justify the intrusion.&lt;ref name="ACLU" /&gt;

The Electronic Frontier Foundation expressed their disappointment in its statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The opinion is almost certainly wrong to classify laptop searches as no different from other property searches. Fourth Amendment law constrains police from conducting arbitrary searches, implements respect for social privacy norms, and seeks to maintain traditional privacy rights in the face of technological changes. This ''Arnold'' opinion fails to protect travelers in these traditional Fourth Amendment ways.&lt;ref name="EFF" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other critics have cited that there are some documents and data that need to be legitimately kept secret or discreet, and are worried that there is nothing to prevent the officials involved in a search from disclosing this sensitive data. They give examples of trade secrets, [[mergers and acquisitions|acquisition]] plans, plans for a new product, security data about private customers.&lt;ref name="Fenwick_article"&gt;Mitchell Zimmerman, ''[http://www.fenwick.com/docstore/Publications/Litigation/Privacy_Alert_04-30-08.pdf Privacy Alert: Gov't Rummaging Through Your Laptop's Contents? No Problem If You're Re-Entering USA, Says Ninth Circuit]'' (Apr. 30, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The concern is that officials in the process of searching may copy and leak this information without consent. Most are unwilling to trust government officials and employees to not misuse what they seize or negligently disclose confidential information.

=== Department of Homeland Security policies after ''Arnold'' ===
On August 1, 2008, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that Department of Homeland Security policies allow federal agents to "take a traveler's laptop computer or other electronic device to an off-site location for an unspecified period of time without any suspicion of wrongdoing." &lt;ref name="Nakashima2008"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ellen |last=Nakashima |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Travelers' Laptops May Be Detained At Border: No Suspicion Required Under DHS Policies |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/01/AR2008080103030.html |work=Washington Post |publisher= |date=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, "officials may share copies of the laptop's contents with other agencies and private entities for language translation, data decryption or other reasons." &lt;ref name="Nakashima2008" /&gt; Senator [[Russell Feingold]] called these policies "truly alarming" and said that he intends to introduce legislation soon that would require reasonable suspicion for border searches, as well as prohibit profiling on race, religion, or national origin.&lt;ref name="Nakashima2008" /&gt; Meanwhile, Ryan Singel of [[Wired.com]] recommended placing one's electronics and papers "in a [[First class mail|first class U.S. mail]] envelope and stamp it—or even better mail it to yourself before the trip," &lt;ref&gt;Ryan Singel, ''[http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/08/border-laptop-s.html Border Laptop Searches? No Reason Needed]'', Wired.com (Aug. 1, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; since 'officers may not read or permit others to read correspondence contained in sealed letter class mail (the international equivalent of First Class) without an appropriate search warrant or consent'. However, this only applies to articles in the postal system, not to letters carried by individuals or private carriers such as [[DHL]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], or [[FedEx]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Customs and Border Protection, ''[https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/natsec/cbp_20100114_000135-000139.pdf Policy Regarding Border Search of Information]'' (Jul. 16, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travelers Privacy Protection Act===
Senator Feingold, fellow [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Maria Cantwell]], and Democratic Representative [[Adam Smith (politician)|Adam Smith]] announced on September 26, 2008, that they had proposed a law to limit the searches of laptops or other electronic devices to cases where United States Customs and Border Protection officials have reasonable suspicion of illegal activity. The so-called [[Travelers' Privacy Protection Act]] would allow border agents to search electronic devices only if they had [[reasonable suspicion]]s of wrongdoing. In addition, the legislation would limit the length of time that a device could be out of its owner's possession to 24 hours, after which the search becomes a seizure, requiring [[probable cause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christian |last=Harris |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=U.S. Clamps Down On Laptop Snoops |url=http://community.zdnet.co.uk/blog/0,1000000567,10009426o-2000537720b,00.htm |work=ZDNet |publisher= |date=2008-09-28 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill was introduced, but never became law due to the starting of the new 111th session of Congress.&lt;ref name="Bill_tracker"&gt;GovTrack.us, [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-3612 S. 3612: Travelers' Privacy Protection Act of 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;

He was of African American, Northern European, and Cherokee Indian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Head|first=Wilson|title= A Life on the Edge: Experiences in Black and White in North America |publisher=University of Toronto Press|date= 1995| isbn=0-9680066-0-4|at= Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in deep poverty in the small black community of Milner, near Atlanta. His father died when he was 11, but his mother stressed the importance of education, telling him he would have to be "twice as smart as whites to compete".&lt;ref name="OBITUARY"&gt;''The Globe and Mail'', Toronto, Ont, Canada. October 8, 1993: A.20. OBITUARY: "Wilson Head led struggle in Canada for racial justice".&lt;/ref&gt; "He was once fired from a job for glancing at a newspaper. His boss didn't think blacks should know how to read. His mother took in laundry but when Head delivered it to her white customers, white boys would throw bricks at him or jump him."&lt;ref&gt;Toronto Star, Nancy White, "A lifetime of struggle", Feb. 18, 1996, p. C.1&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson worked to put himself through school, graduating from [[Booker T. Washington High School (Atlanta, Georgia)|Booker T. Washington High School]] in 1933 and, after taking two years to work and save the fees, graduated from [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]], [[Tuskegee, Alabama]] in 1940 with a Bachelor of Science in Education, by which time he had been named in Who's Who Among Students in American Universities and Colleges, 1939–40.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8351">The '''Zapple doctrine''' was part of a specific provision of the [[fairness doctrine]], an [[FCC]] policy which required broadcasters to present multiple viewpoints about controversial issues of public importance. The fairness doctrine of 1949 allowed station licensees to editorialize, provided that more than one perspective was included in their overall programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Nate|title=Dennis Kucinich: Bring back the Fairness Doctrine|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/01/8640/|website=Ars Technica|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=22 August 2017|language=en-us|date=17 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a departure from prior policy under the [[Mayflower doctrine]], which did not allow any editorial content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio: Sinking of the Mayflower|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800314,00.html|website=Time|accessdate=22 August 2017|date=13 June 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zapple doctrine pertained to a particular sort of political speech situation, when a candidate or his supporters buy air time to support the candidate, or criticize his opponent, but the candidate himself does not actually appear in the broadcast.

{{tocright}}

==History==
The FCC's political broadcasting rules require that [[Equal-time rule|equal time]] be offered to political candidates.  The equal-time rule only applied to the candidate, not to the candidate's supporters or spokespeople though.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oxenford|first1=David|title=FCC Decides that it will No Longer Enforce the Zapple Doctrine – Killing the Last Remnant of the Fairness Doctrine|url=http://www.broadcastlawblog.com/2014/05/articles/fcc-decides-that-it-will-no-longer-enforce-the-zapple-doctrine-killing-the-last-remnant-of-the-fairness-doctrine/|website=Broadcast Law Blog|publisher=Wilkinson Barker Knauer LLP|accessdate=22 August 2017|date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1970, Senate Commerce Committee counsel Nicholas Zapple argued to the FCC that the [[fairness doctrine]] was applicable to air time provided by a broadcast station to a political candidate's spokesperson or supporters. In other words, if one candidate's supporters were allowed to buy air time, then representatives and supporters of opposing candidates should have the opportunity to buy a comparable amount of air time. Similarly, if one candidate was given free coverage by a broadcaster, then that broadcaster should be required to offer free coverage to the opposing candidate too. After careful consideration, the FCC responded to Nicholas Zapple by ruling that all similar parties must have quasi-equal opportunity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the United States Congress, Volume 120, Part 17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cyU_fdnWhD8C&amp;pg=PA23222|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=24 August 2017|pages=23222–23223|language=en|date=15 July 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. they should be treated similarly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Law of Political Broadcasting And Cablecasting: A Political Primer|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-FCC/Law-of-Political-Broadcasting-FCC-1980.pdf|website=www.americanradiohistory.com|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=22 August 2017|pages=86–88|format=pdf|date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision became known as the Zapple ruling, and eventually, the Zapple doctrine.

Under the terms of Section 315 of the [[Communications Act of 1934]], 23 FCC 2d 707 (1970), the Zapple Doctrine applied to purchasing of broadcast time by major political party candidates only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Matter of The Handling of Public Issues Under the Fairness Doctrine and the Public Interest Standards of the Communications Act 36 F.C.C. 2d 40 |url=http://myweb.uiowa.edu/johnson/FCCOps/1972/36F2_40.htm|website=myweb.uiowa.edu |publisher=FCC|accessdate=22 August 2017|date=22 June 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise of the fairness doctrine==
By 1985, the FCC was concerned that the fairness doctrine might actually have a [[chilling effect]], which was the very opposite of the policy's original intent of encouraging fair and balanced coverage: "In order to avoid the requirement to go out and find contrasting viewpoints on every issue raised in a story, some journalists simply avoided any coverage of some controversial issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Limburg|first1=Val|title=Fairness Doctrine|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/fairnessdoct.htm|website=www.museum.tv|publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, journalists felt that it infringed on their rights of free speech/free press under the First Amendment. In August 1985, the FCC decided to suspend the fairness doctrine (it was an FCC policy but not mandated by Congress).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brancaccio|first1=David|title=Politics and Economy: What Happened to Fairness?|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/politics/fairness.html|website=www.pbs.org|publisher=NOW on PBS|accessdate=22 August 2017|date=17 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zapple Doctrine 1985–2014==
Although the Fairness Doctrine was suspended, the Zapple Doctrine remained extant as an FCC ruling for the next two decades.

===Wisconsin election complaint===
On May 8, 2014, the FCC was asked to respond to a political programming complaint, made against a broadcast licensee, [[Capstar TX LLC]] by supporters of [[Tom Barrett (Wisconsin politician)|Tom Barrett]], the Democratic candidate for Governor of Wisconsin. The Barrett supporters alleged that Capstar would not give them any free airtime on its radio station [[WISN (AM)]], in order to respond to statements previously aired on WISN in support of [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]], the Republican candidate for office in the 2012 election. Walker's supporters had received free air time from WISN and affiliate [[WTMJ (AM)]] for political campaigning purposes. Barrett supporters based their complaint on WISN's violation of the Zapple Doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Sue|title=Formal Complaint to FCC re WISN and WTMJ|url=http://www.mediaactioncenter.net/p/formal-complaint-to-fcc-re-wisn-and.html|website=www.mediaactioncenter.net|accessdate=22 August 2017|date=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCC acknowledged that WISN had refused to provide air time to Barrett campaign supporters, in violation of the Zapple Doctrine. However, the FCC ruled that there was no violation of the law: "Given the fact that the Zapple Doctrine was based on an interpretation of the fairness doctrine, which has no current legal effect, we conclude that the Zapple Doctrine similarly has no current legal effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lake|first1=William|title=In re: Capstar TX LLC|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-14-621A1.pdf|website=apps.fcc.gov|publisher=[[FCC]]|accessdate=22 August 2017|format=pdf|date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wiley"&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC Declares "Zapple Doctrine" Unenforceable; Affirms Broadcaster Discretion Regarding Programming Content|url=http://www.wileyonmedia.com/2014/05/fcc-declares-zapple-doctrine-unenforceable-affirms-broadcaster-discretion-regarding-programming-content/|website=WileyonMedia|accessdate=22 August 2017|date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unenforcable===
In re: Capstar TX LLC was the catalyst for the FCC's decision that the Zapple Doctrine was unenforcable.&lt;ref name=wiley /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The agency [FCC] tasked with protecting the public interest in broadcasting has decided that WISN and WTMJ, two publicly-licensed radio stations in Milwaukee, were allowed to give away all the free time they wanted to the supporters of one candidate (in this case, Gov. Walker), without allowing supporters of his Democratic recall opponent (Tom Barrett) any free airtime at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Sue|title=FCC: No More Equal Time Requirements for Political Campaign Supporters Over Our Public Airwaves|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sue-wilson/fcc-no-more-equal-time-re_b_5332812.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=22 August 2017|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
