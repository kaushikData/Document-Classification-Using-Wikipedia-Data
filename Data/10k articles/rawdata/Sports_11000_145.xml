'''Acklam Park''' is a [[rugby union]] and [[cricket]] ground located in [[Middlesbrough]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="CCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/ground/57173.html|title=Acklam Park - England - Cricket Grounds|publisher=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially opened in 1929, the venue has hosted games of [[Middlesbrough RUFC]] since the ground's opening as well as Middlesbrough Cricket Club since 1932.  [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]] have also played a number of first class matches at Acklam Park over the years from 1956 to 1996.

With a capacity of 5,000, the ground initially cost the rugby club £1,200.

==History==
[[Middlesbrough RUFC]] purchased a 12-acre field in 1928 for a fee of £1,200.&lt;ref name="RUFCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/middlesbroughrufcminis-juniors/a/history-8206.html?page=3|title=Information - Middlesbrough RUFC|publisher=Pitchero – MRUFC|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club paid 13 [[shillings]], club members paid £500 and £800 was loaned from the [[Rugby Football Union]].&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt; Middlesbrough played their first games on their present ground in 1929 having played at several previous venues.&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt; Due to the cost of the ground, the club officials began selling oats and wheat from the field in order to pay off their loan from the RFU.&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt; The name Acklam Park was adopted in 1930, and the following year a stand and pavilion were built, funded as a result of 12 interest-free loans of £100 each from local businessmen, the majority of whom refused to take repayment of their loan.&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt;

In 1932, Middlesbrough CC became joint-owners of Acklam Park.&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CCM"/&gt; With play halted during [[World War II]], the ground close in 1940, before being re-opened in 1945.&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt;

In 2008, a new clubhouse was opened at Acklam Park, which includes a bar, a café, a gym, a function room and lounge.&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt; Changing and shower rooms were also inserted, which leads out to an exit to the main cricket and rugby pitches.&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt; Seats are placed in front of the changing rooms exit and café door exit facing a clear view of the cricket pitch and a view of one of two rugby pitches on the left-hand side.&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt; Despite seats, supporters are eligible to stand and watch the rugby team play.&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt; There is also a stand facing the first team pitch, with the stand featuring the name "Middlesbrough Rugby Club".&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt; The stand uses bench seating rather than plastic seating.&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt;

In 2017, it was announced that the club aimed to have plastic seats added into their stand.&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt; In August 2018, the club added dug-outs to the first team pitch.&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt;

==Location==
The ground sits on Green Lane Avenue, and is located near [[Acklam Hall]]. The ground is located near Acklam Shops, and there is a range of pubs near ground, in which the away supporters can have other hospitality. Next door to the ground, there is a care home.

==Other events==
Annually, a summer beer festival is held at the ground, which has raised much money over the years.&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt; They also host an annual firework display.&lt;ref name="RUFCM"/&gt;

On 27 August 2017, the ground hosted a fundraiser event, ''Party in Acklam Park!'', with live music and entertainment.&lt;ref name="PIAP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Party in Acklam Park! festival|url=https://www.skiddle.com/festivals/partyinacklampark/|publisher=Skiddle|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this event was to raise more money for the club, for new developments in the youth teams.&lt;ref name="PIAP"/&gt;

'''Barclays Center''' is a multi-purpose [[list of indoor arenas|indoor arena]] in the [[New York City]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Brooklyn]]. The arena is part of a $4.9&amp;nbsp;billion future [[commerce|business]] and [[residential area|residential]] complex now known as [[Pacific Park, Brooklyn|Pacific Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Atlantic Yards |url=http://www.esd.ny.gov/Subsidiaries_Projects/AYP/AYAboutUs.html |publisher=[[Empire State Development Corporation]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919030221/http://esd.ny.gov/subsidiaries_projects/AYP/AYAboutUs.html |archivedate=September 19, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is at [[Atlantic Avenue (New York City)|Atlantic Avenue]], next to the renamed [[Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center (New York City Subway)|Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center]] subway station on the {{NYCS trains|Atlantic-Pacific|type=route}}, as well as directly above the [[Long Island Rail Road|LIRR]]'s [[Atlantic Terminal]].

The arena is home to the [[Brooklyn Nets]] of the [[National Basketball Association]], and is also one of the home arenas for the [[New York Islanders]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (the other is [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]]).&lt;ref name="espn-September 26, 2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/7022025/jay-z-announces-brooklyn-nets-name-concert|title=Jay-Z: Team to be Brooklyn Nets|first=Christopher|last=Hunt|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=September 26, 2011|accessdate=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Honan|first=Edith|title=New York Islanders to move to Brooklyn in 2015|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCABRE89N1B420121024|agency=Reuters Canada|accessdate=October 24, 2012|date=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena also hosts concerts, conventions and other sporting and entertainment events. It competes with other facilities in the New York metropolitan area, including [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[Manhattan]] and [[Prudential Center]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].

The arena, proposed in 2004 when real estate developer [[Bruce Ratner]] purchased the Nets for $300 million as the first step of the process to build a new home for the team,&lt;ref name="ratner04"&gt;{{cite news |title=Brooklyn Developer Reaches Deal to Buy New Jersey Nets|first1=Richard|last1=Sandomir|first2=Charles V.|last2=Bagli|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/21/sports/basketball/21CND-NETS.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 21, 2004|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; experienced significant hurdles during its development.

The [[Great Recession|global recession of 2009]] also caused financing for the project to dry up. As a result, construction was delayed until 2010, with no secure funding for the project having been allotted. [[Groundbreaking]] for construction occurred on March 11, 2010, and the arena opened on September 21, 2012, which was also attended by some 200 protesters.&lt;ref name="nydn-March 11, 2010"/&gt; It held its first event with a [[Jay-Z]] concert on September 28, 2012.&lt;ref name="nydn-March 11, 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYMN September 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barclay's Center Opens In Brooklyn |url=http://nymn.com/barclays-center-opens-in-brooklyn-with-jay-z-new-york-music-news/ |publisher=[[nymn.com]] |date=September 28, 2012 |accessdate=September 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004031713/http://nymn.com/barclays-center-opens-in-brooklyn-with-jay-z-new-york-music-news/ |archivedate=October 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena and the Brooklyn Nets are owned by [[Mikhail Prokhorov]]'s American holdings.

==History==
The arena was conceived by [[Bruce Ratner]] of real estate developer [[Forest City Ratner|Forest City Ratner Companies]], the New York division of [[Forest City Enterprises]] that Ratner founded. He acquired the New Jersey Nets basketball team in 2004 for $300 million&lt;ref name=NYm/&gt; (he has since sold most of his shares to continue funding the project) for the purpose of moving them to the [[Pacific Park, Brooklyn|Pacific Park]] development on Brooklyn's [[Prospect Heights, Brooklyn|Prospect Heights]] play in the arena that would be the centerpiece of the Pacific Park commercial and residential redevelopment project.&lt;ref name="ratner04" /&gt; The move had marked the return of [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]] sports to Brooklyn, which had been absent since the departure of the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Dodgers]] to Los Angeles in 1957. Coincidentally, the original proposal for a [[Brooklyn Dodgers proposed domed stadium|domed stadium for the Brooklyn Dodgers]] was just north of the Pacific Park Brooklyn site, where the [[Atlantic Terminal Mall]], also owned by Forest City Ratner Companies, is located.

The arena was initially projected to open in 2006, with the rest of the Pacific Park Brooklyn complex to follow. However, controversies involving local residents, the use of [[eminent domain]], potential environmental impact, lack of continued public financing, as well as a major economic downturn delayed the project.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nets Say Brooklyn Move May Be Delayed Further|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/04/sports/basketball/04nba.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 4, 2008|accessdate=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these legal and financial troubles, the development deal seemed headed towards failure or collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No Red Dawn for Ratner|first=Will|last=Leitch|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/51834/|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]|date=November 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Gehry]], an architect involved in the project's initial designs said, in March 2009, "I don't think it is going to happen,"&lt;ref name=NYm/&gt; and Ratner at one point explored selling the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bruce Ratner Explored Nets Sale|first=Frank|last=Isola|author2=Lawrence, Mitch|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/nets/2008/10/27/2008-10-27_bruce_ratner_explored_nets_sale.html|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=October 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of Ratner on May 16, 2009.{{Clarify|date=February 2014}} Opponents appealed the court decision.

Russian businessman [[Mikhail Prokhorov]] agreed to a $200&amp;nbsp;million deal on September 23, 2009, to become a principal owner of the Nets and a key investor in the Brooklyn arena.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The Nets played two preseason games at [[Prudential Center]] in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prudential Center To Host New Jersey Nets Pre-Season Basketball|url=http://www.prucenter.com/default.asp?prucenter=107&amp;objId=73|publisher=Prudential Center's Official Website|date=March 4, 2009|accessdate=March 19, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315001553/http://www.prucenter.com/default.asp?prucenter=107&amp;objId=73|archivedate=March 15, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two preseason games were successful, and a deal that would have the Nets play at the Prudential Center for the 2010–11 and 2011–12 NBA seasons became more likely. Negotiations nearly fell apart, when the New Jersey Sports and Exhibition Authority refused to release the Nets from their lease at Izod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deal to Move NJ Nets to Newark's Prudential Center Falls Apart|first=Ted|last=Sherman|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/12/newark_prudential_center_izod.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|location=Newark|date=December 16, 2009|accessdate=December 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations resumed, and on February 18, 2010, the Nets finalized a deal that would move them to the Prudential Center in [[Newark, New Jersey]] until Barclays Center opened.

The [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled in favor of the state using eminent domain for the project on November 24, 2009. [[Empire State Development Corporation]] Vice President Warner Johnston indicated that the agency is committed to seeing the project completed and said "we can now move forward with development."&lt;ref name="nj.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=New York Court of Appeals Rules State Can Use Eminent Domain to Take Land for Atlantic Yards Arena Project|url=http://www.nj.com/nets/index.ssf/2009/11/new_york_court_of_appeals_rule.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|location=Newark|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 24, 2009|accessdate=February 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another potential roadblock to this development resulted from the Appellate Court's negative decision regarding a similar eminent domain case, brought against Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No Eminent Domain for Columbia University Expansion: Court|first=Jose|last=Martinez|first2=Frank|last2=Lombardi|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/real_estate/2009/12/04/2009-12-04_columbia_land_grab_nixed_no_eminent_domain_for_university_expansion_court.html|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=December 4, 2009|accessdate=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This landmark case could have given new life to the case being brought by the community group Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn (DDDB).

[[File:Bklyn Nets arena Feb 2012 jeh.jpg|thumb|left|February 2012, just seven months before construction was finished]]
However, on March 1, 2010, Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Abraham Gerges struck down a challenge by property owners, regarding the state's use of eminent domain, which allowed the private property to be condemned. Groundbreaking for the project occurred on March 11, 2010.&lt;ref name="nydn-March 11, 2010"/&gt;

[[Barclays Bank]] agreed to a 20-year naming rights agreement for $400 million in 2007. However, 2 years later, due to the slump in the economy the deal was renegotiated to $200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Calder |first1=Rich |title=Barclays Center makes it official |url=https://nypost.com/2012/08/08/barclays-center-makes-it-official/ |website=New York Post |accessdate=September 2, 2018 |date=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York Islanders]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) announced on October 24, 2012, that the franchise would move to Barclays Center in 2015 after the expiration of their lease at the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]], which the team has called home since its inception in 1972. The deal did not require the involvement of the [[New York Rangers]], as the Islanders' agreement with the Rangers to share the New York area allows them to play their home games anywhere on Long Island, including the two city boroughs on the island, Brooklyn and [[Queens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New York Islanders Ponder Move to Willets Point|first=Connor Adams|last=Sheets|url=http://yournabe.com/articles/2010/05/20/astoria_times/news/at_islanders_willets_pt_20100520.txt|newspaper=Astoria Times|date=May 20, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Barclays Center was conceived as a multipurpose arena that could accommodate the Nets and an NHL team, it was built mainly for basketball. While it can accommodate an NHL-size rink, the scoreboard was off-centered above the blue line that is closer to the arena's southeast end. Capacity for hockey is 15,795, the second-smallest in the league (behind [[Winnipeg Jets|Winnipeg]]'s [[MTS Centre]]). The seating arrangement for hockey is asymmetrical. There are only three rows of permanent seating on the northwest end of the arena, and at least 416 seats will not be sold at all due to poor sight lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Everything You Need to Know About Barclays Center's Hockey Configuration|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/barclays-centers-hockey-details.html|newspaper=New York Magazine|date=Sep 13, 2013|accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the signing of the lease, the two [[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]] games scheduled to be played in the arena on January 20 and 21, 2013 between [[HC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]] and [[SKA Saint Petersburg|SKA St. Petersburg]] were moved back to their teams' home venues. As part of the deal, the management of the Barclays Center took over the business operations of the Islanders when the team moved to Brooklyn, though [[Charles Wang]] remained principal owner and continued to oversee hockey operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kosman |first=Josh |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/so_like_isles_start_lookin_like_CXMENQtTB5PWxOamOgIYLO |title=Islanders may change team colors with move to Brooklyn |work=New York Post |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This arrangement continued after Wang sold controlling interest in the Islanders to [[Jon Ledecky]] and [[Scott D. Malkin]].

According to ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'', Barclays Center passed [[Madison Square Garden]] as the highest-grossing venue in the US for concerts and family shows, not counting sports events. That statistic was based on ticket sales between November 1, 2012, and May 31, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Garden wilting at No. 2 as Barclays Center named highest-grossing venue in US|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/garden_wilting_at_no_WroErVTTwgNulGVBhiA4BM|publisher=NY Post|accessdate=24 July 2013|first=David K.|last=Li}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24, 2015, an ironworker was killed when four joists fell on him as he was helping to install the arena's green roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iron worker at Barclays Center crushed to death by steel beams: police|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/worker-barclays-center-crushed-death-steel-beams-article-1.2128317|publisher=NY Daily News|date=25 February 2015|first=Kerry|last=Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poor reception of the arena's quality as a hockey venue affected the Islanders' average attendance in comparison to Nassau Coliseum, which fell to an NHL low of 12,059 (the arena itself is also the second-smallest in the league). The team began to seek an exit from Barclays, although NHL officials judged that the Coliseum (even with its recent renovations) would not be suitable as a full-time venue, as it lacked amenities common in new facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/islanders-making-their-move-to-brooklyns-barclays-center-1435625418|title=Barclays Center to Finally Break the Ice With Islanders, Fans|last=Caldwell|first=Dave|date=2015-06-30|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyp-barclayssplit"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2018/01/23/barclays-pressuring-islanders-into-more-coliseum-games/|title=Barclays pressuring Islanders into more Coliseum games|date=2018-01-23|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2017/09/09/nhl-on-islanders-nassau-coliseum-hopes-keep-dreaming/|title=NHL on Islanders’ Nassau Coliseum hopes: Keep dreaming|date=2017-09-09|work=New York Post|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, 2018, the Islanders announced that they would begin to play a portion of their home schedule at the Nassau Coliseum until the completion of their new [[Belmont Park Arena]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/22254786/new-york-islanders-split-home-games-nassau-coliseum-barclays|title=Net return: Isles get 12 home games at Nassau|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barclays Center was designed by the architect firm [[SHoP Architects]].  [[Ellerbe Becket|Ellerbe Becket/AECOM]] served as the project [[Architect of record]].

Initial concepts for the area were designed by [[Frank Gehry]], whose design proposed a rooftop park (open only to residents of the Atlantic Yards complex) ringed by an open-air [[Track and field|running track]] and capable of doubling as an [[Ice rink|ice skating rink]] in winter with [[panoramic]], year-round views of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="constructiondigital" /&gt; The famed architect's tallest tower, called Miss Brooklyn at 620 feet, was also part of this plan.&lt;ref name=NYm/&gt; Gehry's plans carried a projected cost of $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="constructiondigital" /&gt; Forest City Ratner unveiled a scaled back version of the project on February 2008 reducing Miss Brooklyn's size 40%, and making it 109 feet shorter.&lt;ref name=NYm/&gt; Another redesign unveiled just over two months later scrapped Miss Brooklyn entirely, and in January 2009, the developer started "value engineering" the arena design, cutting its budget even more. In September 2009 the Becket/SHoP proposal with a projected cost (initially) of $800&amp;nbsp;million (ultimately itself revised to $1&amp;nbsp;billion) was unveiled.&lt;ref name=NYm/&gt;

Externally, the arena's shape features three articulated bands with features a glass [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] covered by a "latticework" composed of 12,000 [[Weathering steel|preweathered steel]] panels engineered and constructed by ASI Limited/SHoP Construction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archrecord.construction.com/projects/building_types_study/stadiums/2012/barclays-center-shop.asp?specs=true|title=Architectural Record: Barclays Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; meant to evoke the image of Brooklyn's [[Brownstone#Brownstone dwellings|brownstones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shop-construction.com/#/projects/featured/barclayscenter|title=Barclays Center|work=SHoP Construction|accessdate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|117|by|56|ft|m|adj=on}} [[oculus]] extends over a {{convert|5660|sqft|m2|adj=on}} section of the plaza outside of the main arena entrance with an irregularly shaped display screen looping the interior face of the oculus.&lt;ref name="bc-09-28-10"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Plaza at Barclays Center to Include New Transit Entrance with Green Roof, Landscaping and Open Space for Community Programming |url=http://barclayscenter.com/press/articles/plaza_at_barclays.shtml |publisher=Barclays Center |date=September 28, 2010 |accessdate=October 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016140620/http://barclayscenter.com/press/articles/plaza_at_barclays.shtml |archivedate=October 16, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The arena floor's location below grade allows people in the plaza to view the scoreboard.&lt;ref name="bc-09-28-10" /&gt;

Inside the arena bowl, there are two sports lighting systems: one for the Nets and one for everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443854204578056850231139058|title=No, You Can't Use the Nets' Specialized Lighting System|last=Cacciola|first=Scott|date=2012-10-15|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nets lighting creates a theater-like effect where the court pops like a stage while the rest of the arena goes dark.

Unlike most other urban venues in the US, Barclays Center has no dedicated parking lot; however, it is easily accessible by [[New York City Subway|subway]], [[MTA Regional Bus Operations|bus]], and [[Long Island Rail Road|railroad]].&lt;ref name="transit"&gt;{{cite web

Because of the constrained site, there are only two truck and bus entrances into the building. They consist of two side-by-side {{convert|80000|lb|kg}} capacity elevators which lower vehicles {{convert|35|ft|m}} below street grade into a loading dock area.

The piece was commissioned in 2012 and took six months to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murphy |first=Tim |date=12 June 2013 |title=José Parlá, Barclays Center Muralist |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/fashion/jose-parla-barclays-center-muralist.html?mtrref=www.google.es |work=New York Times |access-date= 28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming rights==
[[File:Barclays-center.jpg|thumb|left|Seen in 2018]]
On January 18, 2007, it was announced that the arena would be called Barclays Center, after London-based banking group [[Barclays]]. It was reported that the banking and financial services company agreed to pay the team $400&amp;nbsp;million over the next 20&amp;nbsp;years for the [[naming rights]] of their Brooklyn home,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nets' New Arena Reportedly To Be Called "Barclays Center"|url=http://www.ny1.com/?SecID=1000&amp;ArID=65958|work=NY1|date=January 17, 2007|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; eclipsing the previous record for naming rights to an American indoor arena, set by [[Royal Philips Electronics]] in 1999, for $185&amp;nbsp;million over 20&amp;nbsp;years for [[Philips Arena]] in Atlanta. However, the rights were renegotiated by the end of 2009, and are somewhat more than $200&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nets Arena in Brooklyn Atlantic Yards Fends Off Challenge|first=Charles V.|last=Bagli|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/nyregion/02yards.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 12, 2009|accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Barclays Center Project POS|page=80|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/23597152/Barclays-Center-Project-POS|accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barclays does not have any retail banks in the US nor does it have its own ATMs in the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Barclays Has No Game Despite Its $400M Arena Deal|first=Mark|last=Decambre|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/banking_airball_Y0KPqD89vF37VR9XCAp8XI#ixzz2739Ws9Iu|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=September 20, 2012|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accessibility and transportation==
Barclays Center is located next to [[Atlantic Terminal]], which services the [[Long Island Rail Road]]'s [[Atlantic Branch]]. Barclays Center is also accessible via the [[New York City Subway]], via the {{NYCS trains|Atlantic-Barclays}},  which stop at [[Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center (New York City Subway)|Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NYCS const|map}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable events==

===Basketball===
[[File:Boston Celtics-Brooklyn Nets.jpg|thumb|right|The Brooklyn Nets playing against the [[Boston Celtics]] in 2012]]
The first NBA basketball game played at the new arena was an NBA preseason game between the Nets and the [[Washington Wizards]] on October 15, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/nets/schedule|title=Nets Schedule|publisher=Brooklyn Nets|accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first regular season NBA game at the Barclays Center took place on November 3, 2012, when the Nets beat the visiting [[Toronto Raptors]] 107–100. The originally scheduled season opener home game was supposed to take place on November 1 against now-cross town rivals the [[New York Knicks]], in what was planned to be a historic event; however, the game was canceled by NYC Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] due to mass transportation outages and a shortage of available police caused by [[Hurricane Sandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.com/2012/10/nets-dunked-by-sandy-mayor-bloomberg-cancels-thursdays-nets-knicks-opener-at-barclays-center |title=Nets Dunked By Sandy |work=New York Observer |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue hosted the [[NBA Draft]] starting with the [[2013 NBA draft]] on June 27, 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 NBA Draft will be held in Brooklyn at the Barclays Center|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/22132413/2013-nba-draft-will-be-held-in-brooklyn-at-the-barclays-center|publisher=CBS Sports|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will remain as the host for the [[2017 NBA Draft]]. In addition to that, they have also hosted the [[2015 NBA All-Star Game|2015]] [[NBA All-Star Weekend]] festivities on February 13–14, 2015.

Barclays Center was also the home for the [[Long Island Nets]] of the [[NBA Development League]] during the 2016–17 season while the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] was being renovated for the 2017–18 season.

====College basketball====
Since its opening, the center has hosted a number of college basketball events. [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] and [[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|Maryland]] signed multi-year agreements to play games at the arena after competing head-to-head in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/college/kentucky-maryland-multi-year-deal-play-barclays-center-article-1.1290820 |title=Kentucky and Maryland agree to multi-year agreements to play games at Barclays Center in Brooklyn |last=Brennan|first=Sean | work=[[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena hosts three early-season basketball tournaments: [[Barclays Center Classic]], [[Coaches vs. Cancer Classic]], and [[Legends Classic (basketball tournament)|Legends Classic]].

The [[Atlantic 10 Conference]] announced that Barclays Center will be the new home of the conference's men's basketball tournament beginning in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Katz |first=Andy |title=A-10 to hold tourney at Barclays |url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/7022534/atlantic-10-moving-conference-tournament-new-jersey-nets-arena |date=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] has announced that the 2017 and 2018 [[ACC Men's Basketball Tournament]] will be hosted at the Barclays Center.  This is a break of tradition from being hosted at the "unofficial" home of the tournament at the [[Greensboro Coliseum]] in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] where it is usually held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wralsportsfan.com/acc-postseason-tourney-headed-to-brooklyn-in-2017-2018/13513212/ ACC: Postseason tourney headed to Brooklyn in 2017, 2018 :: WRALSportsFan.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a three-way agreement with Barclays and the ACC, the A-10 will return its men's basketball championship to the Barclays Center in 2019, 2020 and 2021.

In 2016, Barclays Center hosted games in the [[2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] for the first time. Notable moments at the Brooklyn site include a tip-in at the buzzer by Adam Woodbury to lift the [[2015-16 Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team|Iowa Hawkeyes]] past [[2015-16 Temple Owls men's basketball team|Temple]] in overtime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/woodberrys-rebound-gives-iowa-72-70-ot-win-215503848--ncaab.html |title=Woodbury's rebound gives Iowa 72-70 OT win over Temple |last=O'Connell|first=Jim |location=New York | agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 14th-seeded [[2015-16 Stephen F.

===Hockey===
[[File:Barclays Center - New York Islanders 03.jpg|thumb|right|The New York Islanders playing against the [[Washington Capitals]] in 2016]]
The Islanders played the first NHL hockey game at Barclays Center in a preseason game on September 21, 2013, losing to the [[New Jersey Devils]] 3–0 in front of a crowd of 14,689. The first goal in the arena's history was scored by [[Jacob Josefson]] of the New Jersey Devils. An Islanders game was scheduled for the previous preseason but was canceled due to the [[2012–13 NHL lockout]]. The Islanders and Devils played again on September 26, 2014. This time, the Islanders defeated New Jersey 3–2 in a shootout. The first goal in Islanders Brooklyn history was scored in the first period on a power play (and a delayed penalty call) by defenseman [[Ryan Pulock]].

The first regular season game was played on October 9, 2015 against the [[2015 Stanley Cup Finals|2015 Stanley Cup]] champions the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], who won the game 3–2 in overtime. This was the sixth NHL game at Barclays Center, following five total preseason contests (three in 2015), and one Islanders rookie scrimmage. The first NHL regular season goal scored in the Barclays Center was a shorthanded goal by [[Artem Anisimov]] for the Blackhawks in the first period, while [[John Tavares (ice hockey)|John Tavares]] scored in the second period and was the first Islander to do so.

The first [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] game at Barclays Center was held on April 17, 2016, when the Islanders defeated the [[Florida Panthers]] 4–3 in game three of the first-round series between the two teams. Seven nights later, the arena hosted game 6 of the series, which turned out to be the longest home game in Islanders history. In that game, the Islanders were trailing 1–0 when Tavares scored the game-tying goal with 53.2 seconds left in regulation; he would score the series-clinching goal in double overtime to give the Islanders their first playoff series win since 1993.

===Boxing, mixed martial arts and pro wrestling===
Several boxing matches have taken place in the arena, including [[Danny Garcia vs. Zab Judah]], and [[Ruslan Provodnikov]] vs. [[Chris Algieri]]. The venue hosted [[UFC 208]] on February 11, 2017 and it hosted [[UFC 223]] on April 7, 2018.

The arena has also hosted many [[WWE]] wrestling events, including the PPV ''[[TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs (2012)|Tables, Ladders, and Chairs]]'' and several ''[[WWE Raw]]'' episodes (including its [[WWE Raw 25|25th anniversary episode]] in January 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/sports/features/monday-night-raw-25th-anniversary-wwe-superstar-triple-h-w515638|title=Triple H Is Already Thinking About Tuesday Morning|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2018/1/22/16920886/sneak-peak-pics-raw-25-manhattan-center-set-scott-hall|title=Scott Hall gives us a sneak peak of Raw 25’s Manhattan Center set|work=Cageside Seats|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, Barclays Center hosted [[SummerSlam (2015)|SummerSlam]] (which was originally announced for [[Izod Center]] before its closure), along with [[NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn]] the night before and a post-SummerSlam ''Raw'' the next day,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/52550-summerslam-2015-seeking-new-location-arena-to-shut-down|title=SummerSlam 2015 seeking new location, arena to shut down|date=2015-01-15|work=Wrestleview|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in three consecutive nights of sellouts. On September 28, 2015, WWE announced that SummerSlam would continue to be hosted by Barclays Center in 2016 and 2017, adding a post-SummerSlam ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown Live]]'' broadcast to the events.&lt;ref name=tagline&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE SummerSlam returns to Barclays Center in 2016 and 2017|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/summerslam-barclays-center-brooklyn-2016-2017-27967171|publisher=WWE|accessdate=September 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{main article|List of concerts at Barclays Center}}

In addition to many concerts from a variety of musical acts, the center hosted the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]] on August 25, 2013, bringing the show to a New York City borough other than Manhattan for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barclays Center To Host 2013 MTV Video Music Awards |url=http://www.ny1.com/content/ny1_living/entertainment/179301/barclays-center-to-host-2013-mtv-video-music-awards |publisher=NY1 |accessdate=March 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525144337/http://www.ny1.com/content/ny1_living/entertainment/179301/barclays-center-to-host-2013-mtv-video-music-awards |archivedate=May 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esports===
In May 2018, [[Blizzard Entertainment]] announced the Grand Finals for the inaugural season of the [[Overwatch League]] would be held at Barclays Center.  The event was held on July 27–28, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/23445673/barclays-center-host-inaugural-overwatch-league-finals|title=Barclays Center to host Overwatch League finals|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Legal actions===
During its building, the center was the source of a number of controversies involving local residents, the use of [[eminent domain]], potential environmental impact, lack of continued public financing, as well as a major economic downturn delayed the project.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The [[New York Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of Ratner on May 16, 2009.{{Clarify|date=February 2014}} Opponents appealed the court decision, and a hearing for the appeal was scheduled for October 14, 2009, with a decision to be issued no sooner than November 25.&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;

On November 24, 2009, the [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled in favor of the state using eminent domain for the project. [[Empire State Development Corporation]] Vice President Warner Johnston indicated that the agency is committed to seeing the project completed and said "we can now move forward with development."&lt;ref name="nj.com"/&gt;

Barclays Center has also been accused of mistreating [[luxury box]] holders who are African-American. Three employees of Ludwig's Pharmacy in Prospect Heights claimed in a lawsuit, filed in October 2013, that they were singled out for bad treatment at the arena just because they are black. They are suing for $4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luxury Box Holders Accuse Barclays Center Of Racism, File $4 Million Lawsuit|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/31/box_holders_accuse_barclays_center.php|publisher=Gothamist|accessdate=3 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102225014/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/31/box_holders_accuse_barclays_center.php|archivedate=November 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor issues===
A group of 120 part-time construction workers who work to convert the arena from concert hall to sports venue unsuccessfully tried to switch unions in February 2013. The pay for part-time work is structured differently than that of the same work at [[Madison Square Garden]], and workers have complained about not being able to make a living on one-day-a-month work at $14/hour, and being barred from collecting [[unemployment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130228/BLOGS04/130229858|title=Barclays Workers Fail to Break From Union|last=Bragg|first=Chris|date=Feb 28, 2013|publisher=Crain's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality as a hockey venue===
[[File:Barclays Center - New York Islanders 02.jpg|thumb|right|Seats with obstructed view]]
As the arena was not originally designed with hockey in mind, the New York Islanders' move to Barclays Center has resulted in complaints over seats with obstructed views, and the arena's ice quality.

Some seats were singled out for having poor and obstructed sightlines during hockey games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-best-and-worst-seats-in-hockey-1443832148|title=The Good Views and Bad Views About Barclays Center|last=Raskin|first=Alex|date=October 2, 2015|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Business Insider]]'' has called sections 201 to 204 and 228 to 231, "the worst seat in American professional sports".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/barclays-center-new-york-islanders-seats-2015-10|title=Brooklyn's Barclays Center might have the worst seat in American professional sports|last=Garber|first=Jonathan|date=October 12, 2015|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', Barclays Center CEO Brett Yormark acknowledged the issue, but insisted nothing can be done: "There's really nothing we're going to do from a capital improvement standpoint. You can watch the game on your mobile device. The game is on the scoreboard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/nhl/2016/02/03/new-york-islanders-barclays-center-troubles-brett-yormark-interview|title=Islanders tackling many challenges during first season in Brooklyn|last=Fuchs|first=Jeremy|date=February 3, 2016|work=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been complaints over the quality of the ice during hockey games. The stadium uses PVC piping instead of steel piping under the ice surface, making it much harder to maintain NHL standards and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lighthousehockey.com/2016/10/22/13369316/barclays-center-ice-islanders-complaints|title=In Year 2, Barclays Center Ice Still a Problem|date=October 22, 2016|work=lighthousehockey.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WallendbeenCricketGround.JPG|thumb|240px|A cricket oval in [[Wallendbeen]], [[New South Wales]] with a white [[picket fence]], traditionally used as the boundary]]
In [[cricket]] a '''boundary''' is the edge or boundary of the playing field, or a scoring shot where the ball is hit to or beyond that point.

==Edge of the field==
The '''boundary''' is the edge of the playing field, or the physical object marking the edge of the field, such as a rope or fence. In low-level matches, a series of plastic cones are often used. Since the early 2000s the boundaries at professional matches are often a series of padded cushions carrying sponsors' logos strung along a rope. If it is moved during play (such as by a fielder sliding into the rope) the boundary is considered to remain at the point where that object first stood.
[[Image:Boundary rope.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A traditional boundary rope]]
When the [[cricket ball]] is inside the boundary, it is live. When the ball is touching the boundary, grounded beyond the boundary, or being touched by a [[fielding positions in cricket|fielder]] who is himself either touching the boundary or grounded beyond it, it is [[Dead ball#Cricket|dead]] and the batting side usually scores 4 or 6 runs for hitting the ball over the boundary. Because of this rule, fielders near the boundary attempting to intercept the ball while running or diving, often flick the ball back in to the field of play rather than pick it up directly, because their momentum could carry them beyond the rope while holding the ball. They then return to the field to pick the ball up and throw it back to the bowler.

A law change in 2010 declared that a fielder could not jump from behind the boundary and, while airborne, parry the ball back on to the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explanation of the changes between the 3rd Edition and 4th Edition of the 2000 Code of the Laws of Cricket|url=http://www.mbromcl.org.uk/lawchanges.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=October 2010 Laws of cricket changes – Ball over the boundary|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkq_kBUi13c|work=Lords Cricket Ground|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring runs==
A '''boundary''' is the scoring of four or six [[run (cricket)|runs]] from a single delivery with the ball reaching or crossing the boundary of the playing field. Occasionally there is an erroneous use of the term boundary as a synonym for a "four". For example, sometimes commentators say such as ''"There were seven boundaries and three sixes in the innings."'' The correct terminology would be ''"There were ten boundaries in the innings of which seven were fours and three were sixes". ''

Four runs are scored if the ball bounces before touching or going over the edge of the field and six runs if it does not bounce before passing over the boundary in the air. These events are known as a '''four''' or a '''six''' respectively.  When this happens the runs are automatically added to the batsman's and his team's score and the ball becomes [[dead ball (cricket)|dead]]. If the ball did not touch the bat or a hand holding the bat, four runs are scored as the relevant type of [[extra (cricket)|extra]] instead; six runs cannot be scored as extras, even if the ball clears the boundary, which is in any case extremely unlikely. Prior to 1910, six runs were only awarded for hits out of the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/234084.html "Ask Steven", 23 January 2006] Retrieved 7 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Four runs (or more) can also be scored by hitting the ball into the outfield and running between the [[wicket]]s.  Four runs scored in this way is referred to as an 'all run four' and is not counted as a boundary.

Four runs are scored as overthrows if a fielder gathers the ball and then throws it so that no other fielder can gather it before it reaches the boundary. In this case, the batsman who hit the ball scores however many runs the batsmen had run up to that time, plus four additional runs, and it is counted as a boundary. If the ball has not come off the bat or hand holding the bat, then the runs are classified as 'extras' and are added to the team's score but not to the score of any individual batsman.
[[File:Cricket at Chrishall - geograph.org.uk - 1407180.jpg|thumb|240px|A batsman scoring a six during a game at [[Chrishall]], Essex]]
The scoring of a four or six by a good aggressive shot displays a certain amount of mastery by the batsman over the bowler, and is usually greeted by applause from the spectators.  Fours resulting from an edged stroke, or from a shot that did not come off as the batsman intended, are considered bad luck to the bowler.  As a batsman plays himself in and becomes more confident as his innings progresses, the proportion of his runs scored in boundaries often rises.

An average first-class match usually sees between 50 and 150 boundary fours.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  Sixes are less common, and usually fewer than 10 (and sometimes none) will be scored in the course of a match (especially a [[Test cricket|Test match]]).

==Records==

===Sixes===
The record for most sixes in a Test match innings is 12, which was achieved by [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistani]] all-rounder [[Wasim Akram]] during an innings of 257 not out against [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] in October 1996 at [[Sheikhupura Stadium|Sheikhupura]]. The [[One Day International]] record for most sixes hit in an innings is held by [[Rohit Sharma]] who hit 16 sixes against Australia in [[Bengaluru]] on 2 November 2013 in his innings of 209 off 158 balls.

[[Brendon McCullum]] currently holds the record for most sixes in a Test career with 107.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283122.html|title=Records – Test matches – Batting records – Most sixes in career – ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shahid Afridi]] holds the record for [[most sixes in an ODI career]] (351 in 398 matches, 369 innings, on his retirement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283123.html|title=Records – One-Day Internationals – Batting records – Most sixes in career – ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;gallery&gt; Shahid Afridi 2010.jpg|Shahid Afridi holds world record for most sixes in ODIs.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The record for the most sixes in a Test match is 27, which occurred during a 2006 Test match between [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] and [[India national cricket team|India]] at the [[Iqbal Stadium]] in [[Faisalabad]]. In their first innings, Pakistan hit eleven sixes. India hit nine in their first innings. Pakistan hit seven more sixes in their second innings.

The record for most sixes in a One Day International is 38, which was achieved in a match between [[India national cricket team|India]] and [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] at [[Bengaluru|M Chinnaswamy Stadium]] on 2 November 2013. India and Australia hit 19 sixes each. The equivalent record in [[Twenty20 International]]s was set on the [[Lancaster Park|AMI Stadium]], 24 sixes were hit during the Twenty20 International match between India and New Zealand on 25 February 2009.

In 2012, during the [[West Indian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2012–13|First Test against Bangladesh]] in Dhaka, West Indies cricketer [[Chris Gayle]] became the first player to hit a six off the first ball in a Test cricket match.&lt;ref name="BBCGayle"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/20316154 |title=West Indies' Chris Gayle creates Test history with opening six |accessdate=14 November 2012|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===6 sixes in an over===
On 31 August 1968, [[Garfield Sobers]] became the first man to hit six sixes off a single six-ball [[over (cricket)|over]] in [[first-class cricket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152407.html|title=Wisden – Notes by the Editor|work=Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The over was bowled by [[Malcolm Nash]] in [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire's]] first innings against [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] at [[St. Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground|St Helen's]] in [[Swansea]]. Nash was a [[seam bowling|seam bowler]] but decided to try his arm at [[spin bowling]]. This achievement was caught on film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1TqVCDgH6M|title=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 2007, in a match between [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] and the [[Dutch cricket team|Netherlands]] at the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], [[Herschelle Gibbs]] became the first person to hit six sixes off an over in a [[One Day International]] match. The over was bowled by Dutch [[leg-spin]]ner [[Daan van Bunge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6453331.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Gibbs matches Sobers in easy win|date=16 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April 2013, in a second XI game for [[Lancashire]] against [[Yorkshire]] at Scarborough, [[Jordan Clark (cricketer)|Jordan Clark]] hit six sixes off left-arm spinner Gurham Randhawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/22284876|title=Jordan Clark: Lancashire batsman hits six sixes at Scarborough|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 2015,  Victorian all-rounder [[Marcus Stoinis]] hit part-time medium-pacer Brendan Smith for six sixes in an over on his way to 121 from 73 balls while playing for the National Performance Squad in a 50-over match against a National Indigenous Squad. Smith, captain of the New South Wales under-17s, also sent down a wide meaning his one over of the match went for 37 runs. The game was a non-sanctioned practice match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricket.com.au/news/six-sixes-in-an-over-marcus-stoinis-brendan-smith-allan-border-field-nps/2015-07-08|title=Stoinis smashes six sixes in an over|publisher=Cricket Australia |accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 2017, Worcestershire Rapid's [[Ross Whiteley]] hit 6 sixes off six legal deliveries plus one wide to take the total number of runs in that over to 37 off bowler [[Karl Carver]] at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]]. That achievement did not help [[Worcestershire CCC|Worcestershire Rapids]] beat the [[Yorkshire Vikings]] as the [[Yorkshire Vikings]] won by 37 runs after [[David Willey (cricketer)|David Willey]] smashed 118.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/12123/10959195/natwest-t20-blast-ross-whiteley-hits-six-sixes-in-over-for-worcester|title=NatWest T20 Blast: Ross Whiteley hits six sixes in over for Worcester|author=|date=|website=skysports.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018 Afghan player [[Hazratullah Zazai]] hit 6 sixes in an over, becoming the third ever batsman to do so in a Twenty20.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/cricket/45862488&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Home Championship'''{{Ref label|a|a|none}} was an annual [[association football|football]] competition contested between the [[United Kingdom]]'s four national teams: [[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] (the last of whom competed as [[Ireland national football team (1882–1950)|Ireland]] for most of the competition's history).  Starting during the 1883–84 season, it is the oldest international football tournament and it was contested until the 1983–84 season, when it was abolished after 100 years.

==Overview==
By the early 1880s, the development of [[football in the United Kingdom]] was gathering pace and the four national football teams of the UK were playing regular friendlies against each other, with nearly every team playing all the others annually. At the time, the football associations of each [[Home Nations|Home Nation]] ([[The Football Association]] (England), the [[Scottish Football Association]], the [[Football Association of Wales]] and the [[Irish Football Association]]) had slightly different rules for football, and when matches were played the rules of whoever was the home team were used. While this solution was workable, it was hardly ideal. To remedy this, the four associations met in [[Manchester]] on 6 December 1882 and agreed on one uniform set of worldwide rules. They also established the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB) to approve changes to the rules (a task that it still performs).

The new rules meant that formal international competitions could now easily be devised. Thus, at the same meeting, the associations formalised the annual friendlies and the British Home Championship – the world's first international football competition – was born.

The Championship was held every football season, starting with the 1883–84 season (the first ever match seeing eventual winners Scotland beat Ireland 5–0 away on 24 January 1884). The dates of the fixtures varied, but they tended to bunch towards the end of the season (sometimes the entire competition was held in a few days at the end of the season), except between the World Wars, when some fixtures were played before Christmas. The rise of other international competitions, especially the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championships]], meant that the British Home Championship lost a lot of its prestige as the years went on.

However, the new international tournaments meant that the Championship took on added importance in certain years. The 1949–50 and 1953–54 Championships doubled up as qualifying groups for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] World Cups respectively and the results of the 1966–67 and 1967–68 Championships were used to determine who went forward to the second qualifying round of [[1968 European Football Championship|Euro '68]].

The British Home Championship was discontinued after the 1983–84 competition. There were a number of reasons for the tournament's demise, including it being overshadowed by the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]]s, falling attendances at all but the England v Scotland games, fixture congestion, the rise of [[football hooliganism|hooliganism]], [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]] (civil unrest led to the 1980–81 competition being abandoned), and England's desire to play against 'stronger' teams. The fate of the competition was settled when the (English) Football Association, swiftly followed by the Scottish Football Association, announced in 1983 that they would not be entering after the 1983–84 Championship. The British Home Championship trophy remains the property of the Irish FA, as Northern Ireland were the most recent champions.

The Championship was replaced by the smaller [[Rous Cup]], which involved just England, Scotland and, in later years, an invited guest team from South America. That competition, however, ended after just five years.

Since then, there have been many proposals to resurrect the British Home Championship, with advocates pointing to rising attendances and a significant downturn in football-related violence. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish football associations are keen on the idea, but the English association are less enthusiastic, claiming that they agree in principle, but that fixture congestion makes a revived tournament impractical.

Therefore, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales and the Irish Football Association, with the Republic of Ireland's [[Football Association of Ireland]],  pressed ahead and organised a tournament similar to the British Home Championship. The [[2011 Nations Cup|Nations Cup]], between Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], was launched in [[Dublin]] in 2011. It was discontinued after one tournament because of poor attendance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3607 4 Associations Tournament Announced for Dublin 2011] Football Association of Ireland, 18 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and rules==

Each team played every other team once (making for a total of three matches per team and six matches in total). Generally, each team played either one or two matches at home and the remainder away, with home advantage between two teams alternating each year (so if England played Scotland at home one year, they played them away the next).

A team received two points for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss. From these points, a league table was constructed and whoever was top at the end of the competition was declared the winner. If two or more teams were equal on points, that position in the league table was shared (as was the Championship if it occurred between the top teams). In 1956, all four teams finished level on points and for the only time the Championship was shared four ways. From the 1978–79 Championship onwards, however, goal difference (total goals scored minus total goals conceded) was used to differentiate between teams level on points. If goal difference could still not separate them, then total goals scored was used.

==Notable moments==

===1902: Tragedy at Ibrox===
The Scotland v England match of 5 April 1902 became known as the [[1902 Ibrox disaster|Ibrox Disaster of 1902]]. The match took place at Ibrox Park (now [[Ibrox Stadium]]) in [[Glasgow]]. During the first half, a section of the terracing in the overcrowded West Stand collapsed, killing 26 and injuring over 500. Play was stopped, but was restarted after 20 minutes, with most of the crowd not knowing what had happened. The match was later declared void and replayed at [[Villa Park]], Birmingham.

===1950: World Cup qualification===
The [[1950 British Home Championship]] was used as a qualification group for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]], with the teams finishing both first and second qualifying. England and Scotland were guaranteed the top two places and World Cup qualification with one match to go, when the Scottish Football Association declared that it would only go to the 1950 World Cup if they were the British champions. Scotland played England at [[Hampden Park]] on 15 April in the final game and lost 1–0 to a goal by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'s [[Roy Bentley]]. Scotland finished second and withdrew from what would have been their first-ever World Cup appearance.

===1967: Scotland become 'Unofficial World Champions'===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Keepie uppie]] --&gt;
The 1966–67 British Home Championship was the first since England's victory at the [[Football World Cup 1966|World Cup 1966]]. Naturally, England were favourites for the Championship title. In the end, the outcome of the entire Championship rested on the final game: England v Scotland at [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley Stadium]] in London on 15 April. If England won or drew, they would win the Championship; if Scotland won, they would triumph. Scotland beat the World Cup winners 3–2. The match was followed by a large, but relatively harmless, [[pitch invasion]] by the jubilant Scottish fans, who were quick to waggishly declare Scotland the 'World Champions', as the game was England's first defeat since winning the World Cup. The Scots' joke ultimately led to the conception of the [[Unofficial Football World Championships]].

===1977: Wembley pitch invasion===
Again, the 1976–77 Championship came down to the final game between England and Scotland at Wembley on 4 June. Scotland won the game 2–1, making them champions. As in 1967, a pitch invasion by the overjoyed Scottish fans followed, but this time extensive damage ensued: the pitch was ripped up (although it was going to be relaid after the game) and taken back to Scotland in small pieces to be laid in back gardens, along with one of the broken crossbars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3927302/Recalling-iconic-moment-Scotland-fans-stormed-Wembley-pitch-snapped-crossbar-stunning-England-1977.html|title=Recalling Scotland's famous Wembley win in 1977|publisher=Mail Online|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1981: the unfinished Championship===
[[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland had affected the British Home Championship before, with things turning so hostile that Northern Ireland often had to play their 'home' games in [[Liverpool]] or [[Glasgow]]. The entire 1980–81 Championship was held in May 1981, which coincided with a large amount of civil unrest in Northern Ireland surrounding [[1981 Irish hunger strike|the hunger strike]] in [[Maze (HM Prison)|the Maze Prison]]. Northern Ireland's two home matches, against England and Wales, were not moved, so both teams refused to travel to [[Belfast]] to play. As not all the matches were completed, that year's competition was declared void with no winner; only Scotland completed all their matches. It was the only time in the Championship's history, apart from during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], that it was not awarded.

===1984: the final Championship===
The Home Championships came to an end, with England and Scotland announcing that the [[1983–84 British Home Championship]] would be their last. They cited waning interest in the games, crowded international fixture lists and a sharp rise in [[Football hooliganism|hooliganism]] for their decision. The final match of the Championship was held at [[Hampden Park]] between Scotland and England in which the winners of the game would win the final Championship. The match ended in a 1–1 draw, allowing Northern Ireland to win the Championship on goal difference after all the teams ended on three points each; Wales came second on goals scored.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">{{refimprove|date=September 2018}}'''''Caid''''' ({{IPA-ga|kadʲ}}) is the name given to various ancient and traditional [[Ireland|Irish]] [[football]] games. "Caid" is now used by people in some parts of Ireland to refer to modern [[Gaelic football]].

The word ''caid'' originally referred to the [[football (ball)|ball]] which was used. It was made out of animal skin, with a natural bladder inside.

''Caid'' is believed to have influenced the modern sport of [[Gaelic football]] the rules of which were officially published in 1887 and is now organised and governed by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) as an amateur sport. 

There is some evidence that ''caid'' was taken around the world by the [[Irish diaspora]], and some historians argue that it may have also played some part in the [[origins of Australian rules football]], although [[Relationship between Gaelic football and Australian rules football|such a relationship is controversial and the subject of debate]]. 

==History==
The first recorded mention of football in Ireland was in 1308, when John McCrocan, a spectator at a football game at [[Newcastle, County Down]], was charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard. Football games are mentioned in the ''[[Statute of Galway]]'', 1527, which allowed the playing of football and [[archery]], but banned "'hokie' &amp;mdash; the hurling of a little ball with sticks or staves", as well as other sports.  The [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland to 1700|Sunday Observance Act of 1695]] imposed a fine of one shilling for anyone found playing.  Despite this, the earliest recorded football match in Ireland was one between [[County Louth|Louth]] and [[County Meath|Meath]], at [[Slane]], in 1712.

''Caid'' was especially popular in rural areas, such as the [[Dingle Peninsula]] of [[County Kerry|Kerry]]&lt;ref&gt;Thesis – “Traditional game of Caid”, Father W. Ferris of Glenflesk, Killarney, Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eigeen]] in west Cork. One observer in the mid-19th century, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of ''caid'' during this period: the "field game" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees, and; the epic "cross-country game" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary. Both of these were rough and tumble [[contact sport]]s in which "wrestling", pushing and the [[tackle (football move)|holding]] of opposing players was allowed. It was usually played by teams of unlimited numbers, representing communities, until a clear result was achieved or the players became too exhausted to continue. 

These games appear to have been similar to the traditional [[Wales|Welsh]] game of ''[[cnapan]]'', which was played by teams of up to 1,000 men from adjacent parishes.  ''Cnapan'', however, was played with a hard ball and thus involved no kicking; it was strictly a game in which the ball was passed or smuggled from one player to another, with the object of getting it to the opposing team's parish church porch or to some other agreed destination. An inter parish mob football game similar to ''cnapan'' called [[Cornish hurling|''Hyrlîan'']] (In English ''Hurling'') is still played in [[Cornwall]] on dates that coincide with religious festivals such as [[Shrove Tuesday]].

By the late 19th century, ''caid'' was in steep decline and was threatened with extinction, spurring the formation of the GAA which published official rules for the game in 1887 also adopting aspects of the earlier codified sport - [[hurling]].

The '''Challenged Athletes Foundation''' ('''CAF'''), established in 1997,  assists, supports, and provides opportunity to people with physical challenges, so that they can lead active lifestyles and compete in athletic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Challenged Athletes Foundation|url=http://www.challengedathletes.org/|website=Challenged Athletes Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is founded in the belief that involvement in sports at any level increases self-esteem, encourages independence and enhances quality of life. The Foundation does this by providing funding for training, competition, [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]], and [[Sports equipment|equipment]] for the challenged athletes.

The Challenged Athletes Foundation is divided into four different programs: Access for Athletes, Operation Rebound, Catch a Rising Star, and Project N.Ex.T., all of which focus on the betterment of disabled athletes, but vary in their target group. Access for Athletes is the flagship program of CAF.

== History ==

Challenged Athletes Foundation was founded in 1997 in response to [[Amputation|below-knee-amputee]] [[Ultramarathon|endurance racer]] [[Jim MacLaren]] who suffered an accident while competing in a [[triathlon]]. In June 1993, while competing in a triathlon in Orange County, California, MacLaren was on his bike when a van went through a closed intersection, hit the back of the bike and propelled him into a pole. When he arrived at the hospital he was told that he was a quadriplegic and would never move again from the waist down.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Programs and Events ==

=== Programs ===
The following are programs which CAF offers or supports:

* Access for Athletes – this is CAF’s flagship program. It provides funding for equipment, training and travel expenses. In 2011, Access for Athletes satisfied 980 funding requests from challenged athletes in 45 U.S. states and 22 countries. The grants, totaling more than $1.4 million, were used by recipients – of all ages, from beginners to elites – to participate in 47 different sports.
* Catch a Rising Star – is a program that provides fun, interactive, nurturing clinics – led by recognized experts and authorities – that provide instruction in basic sports skills. These clinics, which include mentoring from elite CAF athletes, allow participants to develop the confidence and self-esteem required to reach their individual goals. In 2011, CAF held 23 clinics and camps across the United States, reaching 495 physically challenged athletes.
* Reach High – is a program provides information, resources and opportunities to people with physical challenges, enabling them to make informed decisions about health, lifestyle and medical choices. The program also raises awareness within the broader community about the abilities of athletes with physical challenges.
* Operation Rebound – CAF is a member organization of Operation Rebound, a sports and fitness program for American military personnel, veterans and first responders with permanent physical disabilities. In 2011, CAF Operation Rebound provided 240 grants injured troops and first responders and supported an additional 80 individuals through its Military Medical Center Physical Training Program and CAF events.
* Project N.Ex.T. (New Expectations Today) – is a three-year San Diego County pilot program that connects physically challenged mentees with similarly challenged mentors. By educating recently injured or inactive individuals about available fitness and sports opportunities, we believe we can create better and more consistent outcomes for Project N.Ex.T. participants.

=== Events ===
The Challenged Athletes Foundation holds a number of high-profile fund raising events in order to raise money to support disabled athletes to compete in sports. These include CAF events the San Diego Triathlon Challenge; Million Dollar Challenge; Heroes, Heart and Hope Gala held at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel|Waldorf Astoria]] in [[New York City]], Hawaii Revisited; Tour de Cove; Rock on the Green and numerous other events under the banner of Race for a Reason.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Athletes ==

The Challenged Athletes Foundation has enabled a number of disabled athletes to get to the starting line. Amongst these are [[Sarah Reinertsen]] who was the first female leg amputee to complete the [[Ironman Triathlon World Championships]] in [[Kona, Hawaii]].

Other well-known challenged athletes include:
*[[Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah]]
*[[Rudy Garcia-Tolson]]
*[[Evan Strong]]

'''Challenger Columbia Stadium''' is a multi-purpose stadium in [[League City, Texas]]. It is the second stadium in the [[Clear Creek Independent School District]] (CCISD) and serves all five of its comprehensive 6A high schools. The stadium was built to relieve the overused and deficient [[Veterans Memorial Stadium (League City)|Veterans Memorial Stadium]] and end the frequently scheduled Thursday night football games for all the CCISD high schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ccisdchallengercolumbia.com/about-the-stadium.html|title = About Challenger Columbia Stadium|date = |accessdate = 26 July 2015|website = Challenger Columbia Stadium|publisher = Clear Creek ISD|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/deer_park/sports/challenger-columbia-stadium-launch-delayed/article_9f4d9d1a-6ded-5689-b52b-70168b719f18.html|title = Challenger-Columbia stadium launch delayed|date = 16 July 2015|accessdate = 26 July 2015|website = Deer Park Broadcaster|publisher = Your Houston News|last = Dunnam|first = Ted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
CCISD's Veterans Memorial Stadium was built in the 1950s at [[Clear Creek High School (League City, Texas)|Clear Creek High School]] to serve the one 3A high school in the district at the time. Since then, the district has grown tremendously, opening four more high schools. Since 2000 alone, the district has built two high schools, opening [[Clear Springs High School]] in 2007 and [[Clear Falls High School]] in 2010. With five 6A high schools to serve, Veterans Memorial Stadium is unable to fully handle the load, leading to numerous Thursday football games. Events at Veterans Memorial, in turn, increase traffic and congestion at the neighboring CCISD facilities and residential area. Stadium parking overflows into the parking lots at Clear Creek High School, Clear Creek Intermediate, the CCISD Education Support Center, and neighboring businesses and residences. The traffic also affects the already congested Five Corners of League City, where the stadium is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ccisd.net/2013-bond-election/faqs|title = 2013 Bond FAQs|date = |accessdate = 26 July 2013|website = |publisher = Clear Creek ISD|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clear Creek ISD held a bond election on 11 May 2013 with the construction of a second district stadium as a major item. The bond was approved with 68% in favor. The 2013 Bond also calls for the rebuilding of multiple campuses in the district and major construction at others, along with the introduction of improved technological learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ccisd.net/2013-bond|title = 2013 Bond|date = |accessdate = 26 July 2015|website = 2013 Bond|publisher = Clear Creek ISD|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium broke ground on 26 March 2014 at a ceremony with family members of the Challenger and Columbia crews and members of various CCISD extracurricular activities (football, band, cheerleading, track, etc.) present.

Challenger Columbia Stadium was originally scheduled for completion in mid-2015, in time for the 2015 high school football season. However, heavy rains in the Houston-area throughout the spring of 2015 led to construction delays. Clear Creek ISD eventually determined that the stadium would not be done in time for the 2015 season, and the schedules for the five high schools had to be changed and consolidated back to only one stadium, Veterans Memorial Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/deer_park/sports/challenger-columbia-stadium-launch-delayed/article_9f4d9d1a-6ded-5689-b52b-70168b719f18.html|title=Challenger-Columbia stadium launch delayed|last=Dunnam|first=Todd|date=|website=Deer Park Broadcaster|publisher=Your Houston News|publication-date=16 July 2015|access-date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After multiple delays, Challenger Columbia Stadium opened in March 2016 with an official dedication on 10 March 2016. The dedication ceremony included the athletes, bands, and cheerleaders from the five high schools and tributes to the crew members lost in the Challenger and Columbia disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.click2houston.com/news/clear-creek-isd-dedicates-stadium-in-memory-of-challenger-columbia-astronauts|title=Clear Creek ISD dedicates stadium in memory of Challenger, Columbia astronauts|last=Martinez|first=Jonathan|website=KPRC|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CCISD serves the [[Clear Lake (region)|Clear Lake]] area, including the area directly around [[NASA]]'s [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]]. The stadium site is also located adjacent to the Challenger Seven Memorial Park. The district chose the name Challenger Columbia Stadium to honor the 14 astronauts who lost their lives in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]] in 1986 and the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Columbia disaster]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ccisd.net/ccisd-challenger-columbia-stadium/about-our-heroes|title = About Our Heroes|date = |accessdate = 26 July 2015|website = Challenger Columbia Stadium|publisher = Clear Creek ISD|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clear Creek ISD broke ground on Challenger Columbia stadium on 26 March 2014 with family members of some of the lost crew members in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/bay_area/news/clear-creek-isd-s-challenger-columbia-stadium-to-pay-tribute/article_2b41a736-3c1a-5558-bb02-dfc37c7eddec.html|title = Clear Creek ISD’s Challenger Columbia Stadium to pay tribute to fallen crews|date = 1 April 2014|accessdate = 26 July 2015|website = Bay Area The Citizen|publisher = Your Houston News|last = Orozoco|first = Y.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chennai Veerans''' was a Tier-1 level [[field hockey]] team [[Premier Hockey League]] in [[India]]. In the inaugural cup in 2005, the ''Chennai Veerans'' led by [[Ignace Tirkey]] finished at the bottom of the group with two wins and six losses.

After finishing at the bottom of the premier division in the inaugural PHL in year 2005, Chennai Veerans were relegated to Tier-II division of PHL in 2006, where they played along with [[Orissa Steelers]], Lucknow Nawabs, Delhi Dazzlers and Imphal Rangers. In this league Chennai Veerans finished runners-up to Orissa Steelers. 
It was later decided that in 2007 no team should be relegated from Tier I. Instead 2 teams were added to the premier division [Tier-I].

[[Image:Agameofcherokeemarbles.svg|thumb|A Cherokee marbles game in progress.]]

'''Cherokee marbles''' (ᏗᎦᏓᏲᏍᏗ, '''digadayosdi'''), or ''five hole,'' is a traditional game among the [[Cherokee]] people of the [[United States]].

==The game==
It is played, traditionally, with round balls made of stone, but now sometimes with standard [[billiard balls]]. An annual tournament is held during [[Cherokee National Holiday]] each [[Labor Day]] weekend.

==History==
The origin of the game is unknown, and it is not mentioned in the works of ethnologist [[James Mooney]].&lt;ref&gt;Conley, Robert J. ''A Cherokee Encyclopedia.'' Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2007. Page 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cherokee marbles is a similar game to the rolley hole [[marbles]] played by [[Anglo-America]]ns in [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]], though the dimensions are different and rolley hole uses three holes instead of five.&lt;ref&gt;Bilger, Burkhard. ''Noodling for Flatheads''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2001. Page 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the game has been introduced into the public schools in Northeast Oklahoma, by the Cherokee Nation, as part of a program to discourage [[methamphetamine]] abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turtleisland.org/discussion/viewtopic.php?t=4153&amp;highlight=cherokee+nation+meth TurtleIsland.org :: View topic - Cherokee children play games to fight drugs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
There is an official rulebook which is used in tournament play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cherokee.org/home.aspx?section=story&amp;id=WCdiNfoO6Ag= Cherokee.org | Cherokee Marbles Training Underway&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is played on a field about 100 feet in length, and with five holes. A player must advance to each hole, knocking other players' marbles out in a prescribed manner, and return again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yvwiiusdinvnohii.net/Cherokee/CherokeeSocialGames.htm "the People's Paths!"

'''Choi Jung Hwa''' (born 22 May 1951) is the only son of General [[Choi Hong Hi]], who is always regarded as the founder of [[Taekwondo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myvirtualpaper.com/doc/toromagazine/2003-jun-july3/2009112001/100.html#104|title=TORO Magazine June-July 2003 - 0100|work=Virtual Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taekwondo-korea/n-korea-used-taekwondo-group-to-plot-murder-report-idUSSEO27677920080909|title=North Korea used taekwondo group to plot murder: report|date=9 September 2008|accessdate=27 November 2017|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Choi Jung Hwa studied taekwondo since the age of 7 under his father and many prominent high ranking taekwondo Masters during their visits and stays with General Choi. His claimed earliest recollections of training are around the time General Choi was appointed as Korea's Ambassador to Malaysia.

Choi spent his early childhood training on the lawn of the Embassy compound, as there were no [[dojang]]s established at that point. He grew up in an environment surrounded by taekwondo due to General Choi's schedule and work in spreading taekwondo globally. Choi Jung Hwa trained with many high-ranking instructors during this period.

==International Taekwon-Do Federation==
Choi held the post of Secretary General and Vice Secretary of the [[International Taekwon-Do Federation|ITF]] for several years until [[International Taekwon-Do Federation#History and Schism|elected]] as [[Choi Hong Hi]]'s successor to the Presidency by the ITF members in 2001. He allegedly offered that General Choi should remain ITF President for the first 2 years of that term as to give him the opportunity to "retire with dignity" in 2003. General Choi Hong Hi died less than 12 months later.

Choi Jung Hwa was promoted to 9th Degree Black Belt in 2004 and to the rank of Grandmaster. Choi prefers the title of President or Master to Grandmaster.

He has been a regular visitor to Australia since the mid-1990s.

After his father's death he formed his own [[International Taekwondo Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.itkd.co.nz/reference/essays/6-broken_family.pdf|format=PDF|title=TAEKWON-DO : A BROKEN FAMILY?|website=Members.itkd.co.nz|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/blown-apart-divided-world-taekwondo-050938167.html|title=Blown apart: the divided world of taekwondo|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to forming his own Taekwondo organization he was a Vice Secretary of his father's ITF organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mengnews.joins.com/view.aspx?aId=2894692|title=Longtime pro-Pyongyang taekwondo master returns|website=Korea JoongAng Daily|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choi Jung Hwa still works extensively promoting Taekwon-Do around the world and is accredited with introducing and developing Taekwon-Do in many Eastern European countries such as Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania, the former USSR and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.

Under his leadership, the ITF historically returned to South Korea for its 2004 ITF World Championships. ITF has now commenced re-establishing itself in South Korea, Choi Jung Hwa's country of birth. 
"As an organization, we must become sensitive to the changes around us and be able to cope, without compromising the principles – that is, to maintain this purity of technique and philosophy that General Choi handed down to us…..Don't forget the standards include moral as well as technical."

==Emigration to Canada and conviction==
In 1971 Choi Jung Hwa emigrated to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/historic/33041494.html|title=Man who plotted to kill South Korea's president in Canada returns home|accessdate=27 November 2017|website=Winnipegfreepress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 Choi was convicted in Canada on charges that he conspired to assassinate the President of South Korea [[Chun Doo-Hwan]]. He was sentenced in Canada, and was barred from South Korea (this has since been rescinded).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ward | last=Peter | url= | title=A KOREAN PLOT? | work=[[Boston Globe]] | date=February 28, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/would-be-assassin-returns-to-s-korea/article18137729/|title=Would-be assassin returns to S. Korea|accessdate=27 November 2017|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted in absentia, and travelled as a Taekwon-Do instructor in the then "Eastern Bloc" nations; mainly Yugoslavia and in the DPRK as well. It wasn't until several years later that he returned to Canada to finish his prison term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-09-08-3900728492_x.htm|title=Taekwondo master returns home to South Korea - USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/05/121_66347.html |title= General Chun Doo-hwan took power in a coup|publisher=[[Korea Times]] |date= |accessdate=2014-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7605935.stm |title= N Korea 'hired taekwondo killers'|publisher=[[BBC]] |date= |accessdate=2014-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Colour of Your Jumper'''" is a song written by Australian singer songwriter [[Archie Roach]] in 1993, following an incident where indigenous [[Australian Football League]] player [[Nicky Winmar]] was receiving racial abuse from spectators resulting in Winmar lifting up his jumper and, facing to the crowd, pointed to his skin. A demo of this version was later included on the 2013 compilation album ''[[Creation (Archie Roach album)|Creation]]''. 

In May 2010, Roach performed the song at Melbourne's [[Federation Square]] as part of the Long Walk festivities.&lt;ref name="TOCTC"/&gt;

In May 2013, Roach re-recorded and released "Colour of Your Jumper" which was released as a single. Roach performed the song live on [[The Marngrook Footy Show]] on 23 May 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv-TtKALY6k|title= Marngrook Xtra: Archie Roach - Colour of Your Jumper|publisher=YouTube|date=23 May 2013|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the AFL Indigenous Round "[[Dreamtime at the 'G]]" game on 25 May 2013 between [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] and [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]].&lt;ref name="ASoI"/&gt; 

The song was re-recorded again and included on Roach's 2018 album, ''Dancing with My Spirit''.

==Background==
On 17 April 1993 at [[Victoria Park, Melbourne]], an [[Australian Football League]] match between [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] and [[St Kilda Football Club]] was taking place. St Kilda player [[Nicky Winmar]] was racially abused by members of the Collingwood cheersquad, who yelled for him to "go and [[Petrol sniffing|sniff some petrol]]" and "go [[walkabout]] where you came from".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saints.com.au/TheClub/History/HallofFame/NeilElvisNickyWinmar/tabid/9136/Default.aspx|title= Neil Elvis 'Nicky' Winmar |publisher=St Kilda Football Club|date=12 September 2009|accessdate=31 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the game, Winmar lifted up his jumper and, facing to the crowd, pointed to his skin. The following day, a photograph of Winmar's gesture was published by ''[[The Age|Sunday Age]]'' and ''[[Herald Sun|Sunday Herald Sun]]''. The gesture, was described as a "powerful statement", an "anti-racist symbol",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://afr.com/p/opinion/passing_the_football_racial_test_2NdGZqYLDIUPT0vLeUiDMO |title=Passing the football racial test|work= Mark Lawson|publisher=[[The Australian Financial Review|Financial Review]]| date=28 May 2012|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and one of the "most poignant" images in Australian sport, has been credited as a catalyst for the movement against racism in Australian football. The event inspired Roach to write the song "Colour of Your Jumper", and in particular, racist comments from then Collingwood Football Club president Allan McAllister.&lt;ref name="TOCTC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/the-only-colour-that-counts-in-the-big-league-20100520-vox5.html|title= The only colour that counts in the big league|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date= 21 May 2010|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roach said “When Nicky lifted his jumper that day and pointed to his black skin in defiance of the racial abuse directed at him and other indigenous players in 1993, it made me sad and angry that this champion would have to do that. More importantly, I think, is what the jumper meant to Nicky and many others on that fateful day. What I saw was not just an Aboriginal man proud of his heritage and people, but a young man who had made it, an elite sportsman in the greatest game, Australian Rules Football, the AFL, who played his heart out for that jumper.”&lt;ref name="ASoI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-05-19/archies-song-of-inspiration|title= Archie's song of inspiration|publisher=AFL|date= 19 May 2013|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''contact play''' is a [[baserunner|base running]] play in the sport of [[baseball]]. It usually refers to a runner on [[third base]] breaking for home (but occasionally refers to a runner at [[second base]] breaking for third). Similar to the [[Squeeze play (baseball)|safety-squeeze play]], the runner at third breaks for home as soon as he sees that the [[batted ball]] is on a downward plane for a ground ball. If there is a runner at second base, he will also break for third if the batted ball is on the [[first base]] side of second. The play can backfire if the ball is hit directly at the third baseman or the pitcher as a [[putout]] will naturally be made at [[home plate]] to prevent the run from scoring. In this situation, the baserunner may freeze and return to third. At this point the runner at third's objective changes from scoring to getting in a rundown in order to provide an opportunity for the batter to end up at second base.  The main advantage to breaking for home on contact is that it reduces the amount of time an infielder will have to make a play at home and, thus, increases the likelihood of the runner scoring.  A secondary advantage is that the possibility of a contact play will often cause the defensive infielders to "play in," meaning closer to home plate, giving them less time to react to a hit ball and a greater likelihood of not being able to field it cleanly.

The contact play is normally used when there is one out.  With no outs, it is generally considered best not to risk being thrown out at home, since there will still be two more opportunities for later batters to drive in the runner.  The only exception is when there is also a runner at first, since any ball fielded quickly enough to throw out the runner trying to score is also likely to be an easy double play ball, and the team has a much higher run expectation that inning if the result of the play is an out at home and runners on first and second than if the result is two outs and a runner at third.  With two outs, all runners on base automatically break on contact, since there is no point in staying at their base while the fielder gets the final out of the inning by throwing to first base.

Most students of [[Sabermetrics]] believe the contact play is proper strategy whenever there is a man on third and one out, since the loss from failure is tiny.  Using standard tables of run expectation based on the number of outs and runners on base (such as [http://www.tangotiger.net/RE9902.html Sabremetrics 101: Run Expectancy Matrix, 1999–2002]), the difference between having a runner on third with two outs (the usual result of not using the contact play on a typical ground ball out) and having a runner on second with two outs (the usual result of using the contact play and having the breaking runner caught in a rundown) is only 0.043 runs.  When the contact play scores a runner who otherwise would still be at third while an out is recorded at first, the net gain is 0.730.  Put another way, even if the contact play failed 16 times for every one time it succeeded, it would improve a team's run scoring overall.  Even that understates the advantage, since the need for the defense to play in often results in both the runner scoring and the batter reaching base safely, in which case the net benefit is 1.186 runs, which means that it could fail 27 times as often as it helped and still benefit the team overall.

{{main|Walkalong glider}}
[[Image:Walkalong.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Person flying a Walkalong glider by controllable-slope soaring.]] 

'''Controllable-slope soaring''' (also known as '''Walkalong gliding''') is a type of [[slope soaring]] where a [[slope]] is made to follow a [[walkalong glider]] (a lightweight toy aircraft), both sustaining and controlling the [[gliding flight|glider]]'s [[trajectory]] by modifying the [[wind]] in the vicinity of the airplane. 

A controllable slope is any object which can be used to affect the [[air]] under the airplane: a piece of [[Paperboard|cardboard]], the pilot's [[hands]] or even [[head]]. The controllable slope is usually manipulated by a person following the [[Glider aircraft|glider]] in [[flight]] (please see photo at right). 

Controllable-slope soaring allows a glider to achieve sustained flight without the need for an onboard [[aircraft engine]] or onboard [[flight control system]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4243">The '''County Cricket Council''' was a short lived body intended to regulate county cricket in England. It existed from 1887 to 1890.

The Council was the brain-child of [[George Harris, 4th Baron Harris|Lord Harris]]. In November 1886 he had sent a letter to the County Secretaries asking the question as to whether the existing two year qualification rule should be reduced to one year. Under this rule players who changed counties generally had to serve a two year residence qualification in their new county during which they were unable to play inter-county matches for either county. The proposal was defeated at the annual Secretary's meeting in December 1886, but at the same meeting it was agreed that a committee be set up to consider the rules of county cricket generally. At a meeting in July 1887, at which the report of the committee was considered, it was agreed that a County Cricket Council be formed. It was further agreed that the existing committee frame the by-laws of the new Council.

The first meeting on the Council was on 5 December 1887 at which Lord Harris was elected Chairman. Nothing specific was agreed at this meeting but at a further meeting on 8 February 1888 a change to the hours of play was agreed, as was a proposal regarding a change in the lbw law. Since the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|M.C.C.]] decided the laws this was no more than a suggestion. A proposal abolishing boundaries in favour of all hits run out was defeated.

At the December 1888 meeting a number of proposals relating to the qualification rules were considered but were not carried.

At the December 1889 meeting a proposal by Durham regarding the classification of the counties and a system of promotion and relegation was considered. A committee was set up to consider the issues. The committee proposed three tiers of counties; the existing 8 first class counties, 8 second-class counties and a further 8 third-class counties. It proposed a system of promotion and relegation involving the bottom team of one division playing the top team in the lower division. They would play each other home and away in the following season, the results determining whether the two changed places. Any change would take place in the following season, promotion would therefore take two years.

These proposals were considered at the fourth annual meeting of the Council in December 1890. They were not well received. Eventually a vote was taken on whether The Cricket Council itself should be suspended [[Adjournment sine die|sine die]]. The motion was passed on the casting vote of the Chairman, Mr M.J. Ellison, and The Cricket Council effectively ceased to exist. "This utterly unexpected result fairly took those present by surprise, and they dispersed hurriedly - a most undignified ending to what we are compelled to describe as a most unbusinesslike meeting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Cricket: A Weekly Record of the Game]] |year=1890 |pages=468–469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the following day, 9 December 1890, the county secretaries met to decide the fixtures for 1891. Since the Council had collapsed and no proposal had been passed the counties arranged their fixtures on the old basis of arranging "home and home" matches against whichever counties they wished. "The most noticeable feature ... is the encouragement given to Somersetshire by the chief county clubs. Middlesex played the western shire last summer, but Kent, Surrey, Yorkshire, Gloucestershire and Lancashire will next summer test the merits of the eleven, which showed such good all round cricket, under [[Herbie Hewett|Mr. H.T. Hewett]]'s command, last year." By arranging these 12 matches against first-class counties Somerset became a [[de facto]] first-class county without any proposal or vote to that effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Cricket: A Weekly Record of the Game]] |year=1890 |page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the home of the various incarnations of [[Dover F.C.]] from 1931 until the club folded in 1983. Since then it has been the home of [[Dover Athletic F.C.]], and it was also the temporary home of [[Margate F.C.]] between 2002 and 2004, when the club's [[Hartsdown Park]] stadium was being redeveloped.  The stadium has two seated stands and two covered terraces and holds a total of 5,745 fans (including 1,010 seats and 3,642 covered terracing), although in the past, crowds larger than that figure could be accommodated.  It also has a clubhouse, which the club completely redeveloped in 2008.

A sports ground was first established on the site at the end of the 19th century and was used for both [[cricket]] and football as well as for other sports. This ground was used by [[Kent County Cricket Club]] for over 100 [[first-class cricket]] matches between 1907 and 1976 and is now the home of Dover [[Rugby Union]] Club.

==History==
[[File:Crabble1890s.jpg|thumb|left|The Crabble Meadows area shortly after the Athletic Ground was laid out in 1897]]
In 1896, a syndicate of local businessmen began a project to create a sports complex at the site known as Crabble Meadows on the outskirts of [[Dover]].  The word ''Crabble'', which is also found in the name of a local corn mill,&lt;ref name="crabblemill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmt.org.uk/|title=Crabble Corn Mill|publisher=Crabble Corn Mill Trust|accessdate=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; derives from the [[Old English]] ''crabba hol'', meaning a hole in which crabs are found.&lt;ref name="crabble"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dover-kent.co.uk/history/name_origin.htm |title=The Origin of Dover's Name |publisher=Dover-Kent.co.uk |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227012329/http://www.dover-kent.co.uk/history/name_origin.htm |archivedate=2007-12-27|df=ymd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was an extremely costly one but was completed in 1897,&lt;ref name="CrCr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/england/content/ground/56957.html|title=Crabble Athletic Ground, Dover, England|publisher=CricInfo (reprinted from ''Playfair Cricket Monthly'', 1965)|accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and football was first played on the Crabble site in the same year.&lt;ref name="Cr2" /&gt; The ground was originally laid out on an {{convert|8|acre|ha}} plateau "carved out of the side of the hill"&lt;ref name="CrCr" /&gt; and was originally laid out to cater for cricket and football, with an athletics track and {{convert|640|yd|m}} international standard cycling track around the edge of the playing surfaces.&lt;ref name="CrCr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cr9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talesftre.tripod.com/doverfootballclub/id7.html|title=The Grounds|publisher=The History of Dover Football Club|accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, the original owners of the site, beset by financial problems, contemplated selling the land for redevelopment but eventually sold the site to the [[town council]] for £5,500.&lt;ref name="CrCr" /&gt;  The pitch was shared by the town's [[cricket]] and football teams, with the cricketers being given priority, which meant that the football team was forced to begin and end its season either with a long run of consecutive [[Road (sports)|away]] matches or by playing matches at other, less satisfactory, venues in the town.  To resolve the issue, the council opted to lay out a new football pitch further up the hillside, behind the lower pitch's pavilion.  The first match played on the "upper pitch" took place in September 1931, with a small stand being constructed the following year.  The football club then used the upper pitch whenever the lower pitch was unavailable due to cricket commitments.&lt;ref name="Cr9" /&gt;

Dover F.C. applied for permission to build a grandstand on the southern side of the "upper pitch" in 1947, but the application was rejected.  Three years later, the club was permitted to extend the existing small stand on the opposite side and in 1951, Dover F.C. moved to the upper pitch on a permanent basis, initially paying the council rent of £300 a year.&lt;ref name="Cr2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pyramidpassion.co.uk/html/dover_athletic.html|title=Dover Athletic F.C.
|publisher=Pyramid Passion|accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final match on the lower pitch took place on 26 March 1951, and the first on the upper pitch was held eleven days later, when [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] were Dover's opponents in a [[Exhibition match|friendly]].  Due to a shortage of bolts, the grandstand had not actually been completed at this time.&lt;ref name="Cr" /&gt; Covered terracing at the Town End, where fans had previously stood on the hillside, was added soon afterwards.&lt;ref name="Cr2" /&gt; Floodlights were added in 1961 and inaugurated with a match against a [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] XI.&lt;ref name="Cr" /&gt;

Dover F.C folded in 1983, but the newly formed Dover Athletic took over the ground and continued to make improvements. When the team won the [[Southern League (football)|Southern League]] championship in 1990, however, promotion to the [[Football Conference]] was refused on the grounds that the stadium did not meet the standard required by the higher division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Bill|last=Bateson |author2=Albert Sewell | title=News of the World Football Annual 1990/91| publisher=Invincible Press | year=1990| isbn =  0-85543-207-1|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, new turnstiles were installed and two new terraces were built behind the goals. The seating in the main stand was replaced and a second grandstand was added on the opposite side of the pitch. These improvements meant that the club was able to gain promotion after its second Southern League title in 1993.&lt;ref name="Cr2" /&gt;  In the [[2002-03 in English football|2002&amp;ndash;03]] and [[2003-04 in English football|2003&amp;ndash;04]] seasons, [[Margate F.C.]] played home fixtures at the stadium while redevelopment work took place at their own [[Hartsdown Park]] ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The club hopes the new building will become a popular venue for social and business functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre Spot 2008|url=http://www.doverathletic.com/index.php?p=news&amp;id=937|author=Justin Allen|publisher=Dover Athletic F.C.|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and facilities==
[[File:PlanOfCrabble.png|thumb|right|A plan of the ground]]
The stadium is known for its unusual location, being set into the side of a hill.  It has two seated stands and two covered terraces. The Main Stand, which has been in place since 1951, occupies the length of one side of the [[Association football pitch|pitch]] and has a roof supported by numerous columns, which obscure the view for some fans.  Identical covered terraces for standing spectators are behind both goals, which also suffer from an obstructed view. The small Family Stand occupies a portion of the side opposite the Main Stand. The remainder of this side of the ground is taken up by the clubhouse, [[washroom|toilets]] and other club facilities.  Unlike most football stadiums, the club directors' lounge is set atop one of the stands.&lt;ref name="Cr2" /&gt;  In December 2009 [[the Football Association]] gave the stadium's facilities an A grade, meaning that it meets the minimum standard for entry to [[the Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doverathletic.com/index.php?p=news&amp;id=1424|title=Whites make the A grade|publisher=Dover Athletic F.C.|date=2009-12-22|accessdate=2009-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is approximately {{convert|1.5|mi|km|0}} from [[Kearsney railway station]], which lies on [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]]'s [[Chatham Main Line]] from [[Victoria Station (London)|London Victoria]] to [[Dover Priory railway station|Dover Priory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livedepartureboards.co.uk/ldb/summary.aspx?T=KSN|title=Live Departures: Kearsney (KSN)|accessdate=2008-04-15|publisher=National Rail Enquiries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dover Priory itself is further away, but connecting bus services are available.&lt;ref name="Cr2" /&gt; Parking is available around the perimeter of the adjacent [[Rugby football|rugby]] club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awads.co.uk/index.php?command=db&amp;page=Dover%20Athletic|title=Dover Athletic|accessdate=2008-04-15|publisher=Association of Wheelchair &amp; Ambulant Disabled Supporters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records==
The highest attendance ever recorded at the ground was recorded when "just under 7,000" fans were in attendance for a match between Dover F.C. and [[Folkestone F.C.|Folkestone]] on 13 October 1951.&lt;ref name="Cr" /&gt;  Current club Dover Athletic's record home attendance is the crowd of 5,645 for the match against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the FA Cup on 4 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harvey|first1=Camilla|title=Dover bow out of FA cup to Palace|url=http://doverathletic.com/index.php?p=matchreport&amp;date=2015-01-04|publisher=[[Dover Athletic F.C.]]|accessdate=2015-08-25|date=2015-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lower pitch at The Crabble was originally intended primarily for cricket. It was used by Dover Cricket Club and football matches had to be scheduled around cricket fixtures until Dover F.C. moved to the upper ground in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Cr9" /&gt; The ground hosted [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] in 1899 and the first cricket festival was held on the ground in 1900.&lt;ref name=dh&gt;[https://doverhistorian.com/2014/01/07/crabble-athletic-ground-and-county-cricket/ Crabble Athletic Ground and County Cricket], Dover Historian, 2014-01-07.

After a series of matches during the 1960s where the pitch was considered not at first-class standard, only one match was held at the ground in 1968 after an MCC inspector passed the ground fit.&lt;ref name=times7dev67&gt;No Dover cricket week in 1968, ''[[The Times]]'', 1967-12-07, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; After a full festival programme in 1969, Kent gradually began to move away from the ground.

==History==
The club was created in 1960 by a fusion of "''Africa Sport''" Bamako and "''Foyer du Soudan''", two successful teams during  [[French colonial empire|French Colonial rule]].

The team was helped a lot during the 1970s by officer [[:fr:Tiécoro Bagayoko|Tiécoro Bagayoko]], a prominent member of the ruling [[military dictatorship]] of president [[Moussa Traoré]]. Many critics of Djoliba AC, especially coming from the rival [[Stade Malien]], claim that the strength of the club was built during that period.

However, [[Tiekoro Bagayoko]] was gone in 1978 after his arrest, yet Djoliba kept obtaining titles and cups. Today, it is reputed to be the biggest and the most organized soccer club in Mali.

===Malien Première Division 2007/08===
2008 was a year of great success for Djoliba, having finished the year before in second place to their cross town rivals, Djoliba handily took the cup and league double in 2008. Reigning champions from the 2007 [[Malien Première Division]], Stade and Djoliba sat atop the standings the entire season, with Djoliba leading by a small but consistent margin in the run up to the final games.  Their 7 July derby match was postponed to August, and although they lost this match their rivals, Stade faltered where Djoliba were consistent, finishing the season 9 points ahead of Stade. The only Cup meeting between the two rivals in the season was in the Semi-finals of the [[Malien Cup]], where Stade faced the humiliation of a 5–0 drubbing by Djoliba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesm/mali08.html rsssf.com Mali 2008 (Last updated: 4 September 2008)]&lt;br&gt;[http://www.maliweb.net/category.php?NID=34198 Djoliba-Stade (5–0) : La grande humiliation !], Le Républicain, 04/08/2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bamako District Mayor's Cup====
Djoliba's one failure came at the end of the season, losing the "Coupe du Maire du District": the Bamako District Mayor's Cup to arch rivals [[Stade Malien]]. But while Stade made it to the final, its victory over Djoliba came from legal, rather than on the field factors.  In the 44th minute of the match, Djoliba supporters rioted, attacking officials, other fans, and journalists.  The match was called off, and several days later, awarded to Stade. Djoliba were fined 500.000 F cfa, all payments for previous matches were withdrawn, and they were excluded form the 2009 competition. Stade received the trophy and a 750,000 F Cfa award from the Mayor of Bamako Adama Sangaré on 23 September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maliweb.net/category.php?NID=35838 Coupe du Maire du District : Le Stade reçoit son trophée]. L'Essor, 24 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008/09 Season===
Djoliba competed in [[2008–09 Malian Première Division]], beginning in December 2008. They began the season successfully, taking the [[Super Coupe National du Mali]] on 6 December against [[Club Olympique de Bamako]] 5–2. The Super Coupe launches the regular schedule by pitting the previous years' League and Cup winners. As Djoliba won both, they faced last years' Coupe du Mali runner up, COB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/DEPAPA82445/--Football-Super-Coupe-Djoliba-Le-Djoliba-s?adjuge-la-Super-Coupedu-Mali-de-football.html Le Djoliba s’adjuge la Super Coupe du Mali de football].

Djoliba appeared at group stage in the [[2012 CAF Confederation Cup]], they challenged with [[AC Léopards]] of the Republic of the Congo, Morocco's [[WAC Casablanca]] and brought Mali's largest rivalry to the cup competition, [[Stade Malien]], Djoliba defeat that club in two matches.  Djoliba advanced to the semis and defeated a Sudanese club and challenged with AC Léopard's in the [[2012 CAF Confederation Cup Final|finals]] and lost to that club, there, they made the greatest position in the continental competitions for Djoliba.

In the 2017 season, Djoliba was 8th place and had two wins and a draw and had seven points before the abandonment as FEMAFOOT was dissolved by the government mainly by an undetermined reason on March 9, over a week later, FIFA suspended the Malian Football Federation on 17 March which meant all Malian clubs competing at the continental level were banned until May 7.  The reason was that money that the Ministry of Sport gave to the clubs.  The least problem of the

Djoliba appeared in the 2017 CAF Confederation Cup and faced Egypt's [[al-Masry SC|al-Masry]]. Djoliba defeated that club 2-0, as a result of the March 2017 dissolution by the government, al-Masry was awarded against Djoliba 0-3 in the away match somewhere on March 18.  The season was halted and in early May, the Federation was restored, their next challenge would be with Kita, that 6th round match is on hold.

:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The match was finished 2-0 in favour of Djoliba, ASFA refused to play the penalty shootout due to arbitration, they were to be banned from CAF competitions for three years, no ban was put as ASFA Dakar participated the following season after winning their second championship title
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Djoliba was disqualified for not paying their debts to the CAF
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;FIFA suspended the [[Malian Football Federation]] (FEMAFOOT or FEMIFOOT) on 17 March 2017 which meant all Malian clubs such as Djoliba were banned from participating in African football competitions, in early May, the suspension has been lifted

The surrounding facility is named after Stephen Lee Marsh.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;

== History ==
Since the late 1940s, Lipscomb baseball played at a field next to Belmont Boulevard, an area close to Ken Dugan Field's modern location.  This field was known as Onion Dell until 1984, when it was dedicated as Ken Dugan Field.  When the baseball program moved nearby to a new, [[USD|$]]1 million facility in 1991, the name was kept.  On March 17, 2005, the facility was rechristened Ken Dugan Field at Stephen Lee Marsh Stadium.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;

In 2005, as part of the venue's renaming, stadium lighting was installed.  In 2007, [[USD|$]]50,000 renovations added a [[warning track]] and an [[artificial turf]] halo around home plate.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;

Dugan Field hosted the Atlantic Sun baseball tournament in 2010, 2011 and 2016.&lt;ref name=tourneyANN&gt;{{cite web|title=Lipscomb to host A-Sun Baseball Tournament in 2010, 2011|url=http://www.lipscomb.edu/archive.asp?SID=4&amp;ca_key=13&amp;co_key=15856|work=lipscomb.edu|accessdate=May 7, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yVOnENpX?url=http://www.lipscomb.edu/archive.asp?SID%3D4%26ca_key%3D13%26co_key%3D15856|archivedate=May 7, 2011|date=19 June 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rb&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlantic Sun Recordbook – Baseball|url=http://www.atlanticsun.org/media/2010-11/pdf/records-baseball.pdf|work=AtlanticSun.org|accessdate=February 18, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65XJkznCw?url=http://www.atlanticsun.org/media/2010-11/pdf/records-baseball.pdf|archivedate=February 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nashville Outlaws]] of the [[Prospect League]] began playing at Ken Dugan Field in 2011, after spending their inaugural 2010 season at [[Vanderbilt University]]'s [[Hawkins Field]].&lt;ref name=outlaws2011 /&gt;

The '''Geelong Racecourse''' is a major regional [[horse racing]] venue in [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. The current racecourse dates to 1908. The annual [[Geelong Cup]] is held at the course every October, as well as a number of other race meets through the year.

==History==
The first race meet in Geelong was on May 1 1841, at Corio. Three races were held on the day. The next meet was held at "Airey's Flat" on the banks the [[Moorabool River]] near [[Fyansford, Victoria|Fyansford]].&lt;ref name=off&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849 a start was made on a proper racecourse, with  {{convert|727|acre|km2}} of land beside the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] at [[Marshall, Victoria|Marshalltown]] chosen. Situated close to [[Lake Connewarre]], the land was subject to frequent flooding.&lt;ref name=off /&gt;

The [[Geelong Racing Club]] was formed in 1866, holding their first meet on January 18 and 19 1866. February 23 1872 saw the first [[Geelong Cup]] held at the Marshalltown course, where a new [[grandstand]] was opened. A [[railway]] branch line was provided to the course in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railgeelong.com/locations.php?name=Marshall|title=Rail Geelong: Marshall Station History|accessdate=2007-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 it was decided to relocate the Geelong Racecourse and [[Geelong Showgrounds]] to their current site on Breakwater Road, [[East Geelong, Victoria|East Geelong]]. The first race meet was held there in March 1908, with the first Geelong Racing Club meet being held there on December 12 1908. The [[Geelong Racecourse railway station, Victoria|Geelong Racecourse railway station]] was also provided at this time.

The course itself has seen a number of upgrades since, the most recent being the provision of a third [[grandstand]] and an upgrade of the track itself.

'''Guayaquil City F.C.''' (known as ''C.D. River Ecuador'' until 2017) is an [[Ecuador]]ian professional football club based in [[Guayaquil]]. They currently play in the country's first-level football league&amp;mdash;the [[Serie A de Ecuador|Serie A]]&amp;mdash;after gaining promotion from the segunda-level Primera Categoria.

==History==
[[File:River Plate Ecuador logo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The badge of River Ecuador, 2010–2012]]
Formed in 2007 as ''Club Deportivo River Plate Ecuador'' (or ''River Ecuador''), the club was founded through a partnership with the dominant [[Argentina|Argentinian]] side [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]].&lt;ref name="RiverEcuador"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://deportes.elpais.com/deportes/2015/12/18/actualidad/1450478328_107679.html |title=Los cuatro River de América |trans-title=The Four River of the Americas |work=[[El País]] |date=19 December 2015 |accessdate=14 July 2017 |language=ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010 the relationship had already ended, but the club continued to operate under its given name and with River Plate's traditional red kit colour.&lt;ref name="RiverEcuador"/&gt;

On 11 July 2017 it was announced that River Ecuador had renamed themselves to ''Guayaquil City Fútbol Club'', changing their strip to sky blue and white horizontal stripes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eluniverso.com/deportes/2017/07/11/nota/6275965/river-ecuador-jugara-este-viernes-como-guayaquil-city-fc |title=River Ecuador jugará desde este viernes como Guayaquil City FC |trans-title=River Ecuador will play from this Friday as Guayaquil City FC |work=[[El Universo]] |date=11 July 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new name, kit colours and badge design prompted a number of claims that the change in identity was the result of a takeover by the [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]-linked [[City Football Group]], though no evidence of this was forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://depor.com/futbol-internacional/resto-del-mundo/guayaquil-city-fc-oficializo-primera-filial-manchester-city-sudamerica-42030 |title=Guayaquil City FC es la primera filial del Manchester de Pep Guardiola en Sudamérica |trans-title=Guayaquil City FC is the first affiliate of Pep Guardiola's Manchester in South America |work=depor.com |date=11 July 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irons''' (first name and dates unknown) was an English [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[cricket]]er who made a single known appearance for [[All-England cricket teams|All-England]] against [[Chertsey Cricket Club|Chertsey]] at [[Laleham Burway]] on 10–11 September 1778.&lt;ref name=GB86&gt;Buckley, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CA45"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/0/45.html |publisher=''CricketArchive'' |title=Chertsey v All-England 1778 |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irons scored 4 runs with a highest score of 4.&lt;ref name="CA45"/&gt; Irons may have played in the return match at the [[Artillery Ground]] on 15 September, but no details of that match have survived.&lt;ref name=GB86/&gt;

As Irons had established his reputation by 1778, he must have been active for some years previously. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other references to Irons.

The '''Jesse White Tumbling Team''' is a team of [[acrobatics|acrobats]] that was founded in 1959 by [[Illinois]] [[sportsperson|athlete]] and [[politician]] [[Jesse White (politician)|Jesse White]] and their agents Zach Mitchell. Their acrobatic performances, choreographed by Mitchell can frequently be seen during [[half-time]] shows for the [[National Basketball Association]], the [[National Football League]] and [[Major League Baseball]] games. 

White, who still coaches, created the team for children residing in [[Chicago]]'s inner city housing projects. It serves a [[juvenile delinquency]] prevention program. Members are required to abide by White's rules, which include staying in school, maintaining a C average in academic coursework and staying away from gangs and drugs. Since the team's inception, over 10,000 children, ages 6 and up, have participated in the program. 

The tumblers have appeared in the movies ''[[Heaven is a Playground]]'', ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', and ''[[The Meteor Man (film)|The Meteor Man]]''. They have performed at the half time for every NBA team with the exception of the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] and the [[Charlotte Hornets]]. They have also appeared in two presidential inaugural parades,  for President [[Bill Clinton]] and President [[Barack Obama]].

The Jesse White Tumbling Team makes over 1,500 appearances each year, in state and out of state. They have gone to U.S. states as far as [[Hawaii]], and have even made international performances. They have gone to [[Canada]] 17 times, [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] to appear on television, [[China]] for the [[Chinese New Year]], [[Bermuda]], the [[Cayman Islands]], and [[Croatia]].

The Team celebrated their 50th anniversary at the United Center in February 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">'''Listowel Racecourse''' is a [[horse racing]] venue in the town of [[Listowel]], [[County Kerry]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] which stages both [[National Hunt]] and [[Flat racing]]. The course is flat and run left handed over an inner rectangular shaped circuit measuring just over a mile, and a triangular outer circuit of a mile and a furlong. There is a chute for the 7 furlong and 1 mile races. 
The current racecourse which is close to the town centre first opened in 1858 and celebrated its 150th Anniversary in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsight.co.uk/Racecourse%20Eire%20Listowel%202.html |title=Course Profile|date=|work=Racingsight.co.uk|accessdate=14 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival==
Listowel's major race festival, the harvest festival, which was originally known as the North Kerry Hunt Steeplechase Meeting takes place each year in September over seven days with both national hunt and flat races taking place. It is one of the final festivals to take place in the summer, the last before Christmas and second only to the [[Galway Races]] in attendances. In total nine meetings take place each year with a two-day meeting every June.

==Guinness Kerry National==
The most valuable race run at Listowel is the Guinness Kerry National. It is run on the Wednesday of the Harvest Festival over a distance of 3 miles and worth €160,000 in prize money. Previous winners include the Aintree [[Grand National]] winner [[Monty's Pass]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1316">{{Unreferenced|date=October 2009}}A '''long hop''' is a type of inadvertent delivery in the sport of [[cricket]]. It describes a short delivery which is not especially fast, which is thus easy for the batsman to hit because he has plenty of time to observe the speed and direction of the ball after the bounce and choose his shot accordingly. In contrast, a fast short delivery which bounces high (to the batsman's chest or higher) is termed a [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] and is often bowled deliberately because it is difficult to hit safely, due to the height at which it reaches the batsman.

A fast ball which pitches short but (due to the vagaries of the wicket surface) does not bounce high is very difficult to defend against, for the batsman will usually expect the ball to bounce high in this situation; this can often lead to the batsman being out bowled or lbw when they leave a ball which appeared to be rising over the stumps but stayed low. Such deliveries are not called long hops, due to the difficulty they cause the batsman.

The term 'long hop', like the term '[[Full toss]]', has passed into slang as a description of an argument or insult which is easily refuted or responded to.

The '''Manawatu Sires Produce Stakes''' is a [[Group One]] horse race held for [[Thoroughbred]] two-year-olds at Awapuni Racecourse in [[Palmerston North]], [[New Zealand]]. Run over 1400 metres in late March or early April, it is regarded as New Zealand's best two-year-old race. The race was first run in 1908 over 1200 metres with the current distance being adopted in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awapuniracing.co.nz/manawatu-sires-produce-stakes-winners.aspx|title=Manawatu Sires Produce Stakes winners|website=www.awapuniracing.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|other people named Mike Rossi|Mike Rossi (disambiguation){{!}}Mike Rossi}}

Mike Rossi (born May 1967) is a [[disc jockey]] and former [[Television presenter|television host]] who gained national notoriety in 2015 after qualifying for the [[Boston Marathon]] with a time that later came under heavy scrutiny, resulting in widespread accusations that he had cheated in his qualifying race.

==Early career==
Rossi was one of the dancers on the 1980s television show [[Dancin' On Air]]. In 1986, one of the hosts quit, and 36 hours later, Rossi became one of the co-hosts of the show at the age of 18.&lt;ref name="citypaper" /&gt; The show was canceled in 1987.&lt;ref name="philly1" /&gt;

==Viral fame and cheating accusations==
In 2015, Rossi ran in the Boston Marathon, and brought his wife and 9-year-old twins on the trip from their hometown of [[Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Abington, Pennsylvania]]. He subsequently received a form letter from his children's principal informing him that a family vacation was not an excusable reason for absence, and that the school days his children missed would be marked as unexcused. Rossi then wrote a response to the principal, which he never mailed, but did post on [[Facebook]]; the post went viral, and was shared by over 28,700 people within a week.&lt;ref name="NBC10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="philly2" /&gt;

After appearances on the [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] show and [[Fox &amp; Friends]], controversy erupted over how Rossi qualified for the Boston Marathon. Rossi had submitted a qualifying time of 3:11  that he had supposedly run in the Lehigh Valley Health Network Via Marathon. The organizers of that marathon asked USA Track &amp; Field for help in investigating cheating allegations, raised mostly by other runners who, in exploring Rossi's race history, noticed that a 3:11 marathon was inconsistent with all of Rossi’s other publicly available race results.&lt;ref name ="post" /&gt; In addition, there were no photos of Rossi anywhere on the Lehigh marathon race course except for at the finish line, while most other runners were seen in 10 or more pictures taken along the way by a company hired to take photographs of the runners.&lt;ref name="RW" /&gt; 

The editors of LetsRun.com, one of the top five running-centric websites in the world, called the evidence "overwhelming" that "Rossi did not run the entire 2014 Lehigh Valley Marathon."&lt;ref name="letsrun" /&gt; The organizers of the Via Marathon sent LetsRun a statement explaining why they could not disqualify Rossi's time, stating it was "simply because they received no reports of wrongdoing as the race took place." They also stated that "there is data from Rossi’s participation in other racing events indicating that Rossi’s time may not be accurate."&lt;ref name="letsrun" /&gt;

===Aftermath===
The founders of LetsRun.com publicly offered Rossi $100,000 if he could repeat his 3:11 performance within one year of the offer.&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt; Meanwhile, the organizers of the Via Marathon announced that they had taken several steps to verify runner participation and timing accuracy after the Rossi incident. Previously, the only timing mats at the Via marathon were at the start and finish line. The marathon committee added four on-course timing mats and video surveillance at several locations that Via would archive.&lt;ref name="mcall" /&gt;

==Arrest at Kenny Chesney concert==
On June 25, 2016, Rossi was [[Tailgate party|tailgating]] prior to a Kenny Chesney concert at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia in Lot K, which had opened up to tailgaters at 10 am. At around 5 pm, when he was asked to "move along" several times by venue security, he refused, and when police arrived on the scene and made the same request, Rossi refused again, and was arrested for criminal trespass.&lt;ref name="cbs" /&gt; At his court appearance two weeks later, a ''[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]]'' magazine reporter approached Rossi, who told reporters that he was not Mike Rossi. Rossi's identity was immediately confirmed by a court official on the scene.&lt;ref name="philly3" /&gt;

==Arrest at a McGraw/Hill concert==
On August 19, 2017, Rossi was arrested outside the Wells Fargo center after a [[Tim McGraw]]/[[Faith Hill]] concert for allegedly punching a 47-year-old woman. Rossi later posted to his Facebook page admitting he had "a hellish past 2 1/2 years," and "most of it I brought on myself and I take full responsibility."&lt;ref name="philly4" /&gt;

The modern '''Olympic Games''' or '''Olympics''' ({{lang-fr|Jeux olympiques}}&lt;ref&gt;With English, French is the second official language of the Olympic Movement.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/fr/|title=Jeux Olympiques – Sports, Athlètes, Médailles, Rio 2016|publisher=International Olympic Committee|date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of [[athletes]] from around the world participate in a [[multi-sport event|variety of competitions]]. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; The Olympic Games are held every [[Olympiad|four years]], with the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer]] and [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Games]] alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.

Their creation was inspired by the [[ancient Olympic Games]], which were held in [[Olympia, Greece]], from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]] founded the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the [[Olympic Movement]], with the [[Olympic Charter]] defining its structure and authority.

The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the [[Winter Olympic Games]] for snow and ice sports, the [[Paralympic Games]] for athletes with a disability, the [[Youth Olympic Games]] for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the [[World Games]] for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The [[Deaflympics]] and [[Special Olympics]] are also endorsed by the IOC. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure [[Amateur sports|amateurism]], as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of [[professional athlete]]s. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the [[Cold War]] limited participation in the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] Games. The latter, however, attracted 140 National Olympic Committees, which was a record at the time.&lt;ref name="olympic.org"&gt;{{Tidningsref|title=No Boycott Blues|url=https://www.olympic.org/los-angeles-1984|website=olympic.org|access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Olympic Movement consists of [[List of international sport federations|international sports federations]] (IFs), [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the [[Olympic sports|sports]] to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the [[Olympic flag]] and [[Olympic Flame#Torches|torch]], as well as the [[Olympic Games ceremony|opening and closing ceremonies]]. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive [[Olympic medal]]s: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.

The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and [[Olympic Games scandals and controversies|controversies]], including [[List of Olympic Games boycotts|boycotts]], [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games|doping]], bribery, and a [[Munich massacre|terrorist attack in 1972]]. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.

==Ancient Olympics==
{{main article|Ancient Olympic Games}}
[[File:Olympia-stadion.jpg|thumb|left|Stadium in [[Olympia, Greece]]]]

The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of [[Zeus]] in [[Olympia, Greece]]. Competition was among representatives of several [[city-state]]s and kingdoms of [[Ancient Greece]]. These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the [[pankration]], horse and chariot racing events. It has been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished. This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce.{{r|Swaddling 2000 p54}} This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were travelling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Olympic Truce – Myth and Reality by Harvey Abrams|url=http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/showcase/abrams1.html|publisher=Classics Technology Center, AbleMedia.com|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend;{{sfn|Young|2004|p=12}} one of the most popular myths identifies [[Heracles]] and his father [[Zeus]] as the progenitors of the Games.&lt;ref name="elis1-7-9" /&gt;{{sfn|Richardson|1992|p=227}}{{sfn|Young|2004|pp=12–13}} According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games "Olympic" and established the custom of holding them every four years.&lt;ref name="elis1-7-7" /&gt; The myth continues that after Heracles completed his [[Labours of Hercules|twelve labours]], he built the [[Olympic Stadium]] as an honour to Zeus. Following its completion, he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a "[[stadion (unit of length)|stadion]]" ({{lang-el|στάδιον}}, [[Latin]]: ''stadium'', "stage"), which later became a [[Stadion (unit of length)|unit of distance]]. The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics is 776&amp;nbsp;BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, listing the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Games|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428005/Olympic-Games/59589/The-ancient-Olympic-Games|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|registration=yes|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ancient Games featured running events, a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, [[Discus throw|discus]] and javelin throws, a foot race, and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, [[pankration]], and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] events.{{sfn|Crowther|2007|pp=59–61}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Olympic Events|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/sports.html|publisher=Perseus Project of [[Tufts University]]|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition has it that [[Coroebus of Elis|Coroebus]], a cook from the city of [[Elis]], was the first Olympic champion.{{sfn|Golden|2009|p=24}}

The Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, featuring sporting events alongside ritual sacrifices honouring both Zeus (whose [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|famous statue]] by [[Phidias]] stood in his temple at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]) and [[Pelops]], divine hero and mythical king of Olympia. Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King [[Oenomaus]] of [[Pisa, Greece|Pisatis]].{{sfn|Burkert|1983|p=95}} The winners of the events were admired and immortalised in poems and statues.{{sfn|Swaddling|1999|pp=90–93}} The Games were held every four years, and this period, known as an [[Olympiad]], was used by Greeks as one of their units of time measurement. The Games were part of a cycle known as the [[Panhellenic Games]], which included the [[Pythian Games]], the [[Nemean Games]], and the [[Isthmian Games]].&lt;ref&gt;Olympic Museum, "The Olympic Games in Antiquity", p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Olympic Games reached their [[zenith]] in the 6th and 5th&amp;nbsp;centuries&amp;nbsp;BC, but then gradually declined in importance as the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] gained power and influence in Greece. While there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held date is 393&amp;nbsp;AD, when the emperor [[Theodosius I]] decreed that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;However, Theodosius' decree contains no specific reference to Olympia {{harv|Crowther|2007|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another date commonly cited is 426&amp;nbsp;AD, when his successor, [[Theodosius II]], ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.{{sfn|Crowther|2007|p=54}}

===Forerunners===
[[File:Baron Pierre de Coubertin.jpg|thumb|upright|Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]]]]

Various uses of the term "Olympic" to describe athletic events in the modern era have been documented since the 17th century. The first such event was the [[Cotswold Games]] or "Cotswold Olimpick Games", an annual meeting near [[Chipping Campden]], England, involving various sports. It was first organised by the lawyer [[Robert Dover (Cotswold Games)|Robert Dover]] between 1612 and 1642, with several later celebrations leading up to the present day. The [[British Olympic Association]], in its bid for the [[2012 Olympic Games]] in London, mentioned these games as "the first stirrings of Britain's Olympic beginnings".&lt;ref name=BOA&gt;{{citation|title=400 Years of Olimpick Passion |url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=853 |publisher=Robert Dover's Games Society |accessdate=4 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606045814/http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=853 |archivedate=6 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''L'Olympiade de la République'', a national Olympic festival held annually from 1796 to 1798 in [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] also attempted to emulate the ancient Olympic Games.&lt;ref name="frencholympics" /&gt; The competition included several disciplines from the ancient Greek Olympics. The 1796 Games also marked the introduction of the [[metric system]] into sport.&lt;ref name="frencholympics" /&gt;

In 1834 and 1836 olympic games was held in [[Ramlösa (Sweden)]] and an additional in [[Stockholm]] (Sweden) 1843, all organized by Gustaf Johan Schartau and others. At most 25 000 spectators saw the games.&lt;ref&gt;Findling, John E. &amp; Pelle, Kimberly P. (2004). Encyclopedia of the Modern Olympic Movement.

In 1850 an Olympian Class was started by [[William Penny Brookes]] at [[Much Wenlock]], in [[Shropshire]], England. In 1859, Brookes changed the name to the [[Wenlock Olympian Games]]. This annual sports festival continues to this day.{{sfn|Young|2004|p=144}} The Wenlock Olympian Society was founded by Brookes on 15 November 1860.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=28}}

Between 1862 and 1867, [[Liverpool]] held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by [[John Hulley]] and Charles Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook, although only 'gentlemen amateurs' could compete.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=53–54}}{{sfn|Weiler|2004}} The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics.{{r|Girginov Parry 2005 p38}} In 1865 Hulley, Brookes and E.G.

===Revival===
[[File:Evangelos Zappas.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Evangelos Zappas]]]]
Greek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the [[Greek War of Independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1821. It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor [[Panagiotis Soutsos]] in his poem "[[Dialogue of the Dead]]", published in 1833.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=1}} [[Evangelos Zappas]], a wealthy Greek-Romanian philanthropist, first wrote to [[King Otto of Greece]], in 1856, offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=14}} Zappas sponsored the first [[Zappas Olympics|Olympic Games]] in 1859, which was held in an [[Athens]] city square. Athletes participated from Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Zappas funded the restoration of the ancient [[Panathenaic Stadium]] so that it could host all future Olympic Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=14}}

The stadium hosted Olympics in 1870 and 1875.{{sfn|Young|1996|pp=2, 13–23, 81}} Thirty thousand spectators attended that Games in 1870, though no official attendance records are available for the 1875 Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=44}} In 1890, after attending the Olympian Games of the [[Wenlock Olympian Society]], Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]] was inspired to found the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).&lt;ref name="wenlock" /&gt; Coubertin built on the ideas and work of Brookes and Zappas with the aim of establishing internationally rotating Olympic Games that would occur every four years.&lt;ref name="wenlock" /&gt; He presented these ideas during the first [[Olympic Congress]] of the newly created International Olympic Committee. This meeting was held from 16 to 23 June 1894, at the [[University of Paris]]. On the last day of the Congress, it was decided that the first Olympic Games to come under the auspices of the IOC would take place in Athens in 1896.{{sfn|Coubertin|Philemon|Politis|Anninos|1897|p=8|loc=Part 2}} The IOC elected the Greek writer [[Demetrius Vikelas]] as its first president.{{sfn|Young|1996|pp=100–105}}

===1896 Games===
{{main article|1896 Summer Olympics}}
[[File:1896 Olympic opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|Opening ceremony in the [[Panathinaiko Stadium]]]]

The first Games held under the auspices of the IOC was hosted in the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens in 1896. The Games brought together 14 nations and 241 athletes who competed in 43 events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/All-Past-Olympic-Games/Summer/Athens-1896/ |title=Athens 1896 |publisher=The International Olympic Committee |accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappas and his cousin [[Konstantinos Zappas]] had left the Greek government a trust to fund future Olympic Games.

Greek officials and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared by many of the athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world. The [[1900 Summer Olympics|second Olympics]] was held in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1896/ |title= 1896 Athina Summer Games |publisher= Sports Reference |accessdate=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes and adaptations===
{{main article|Summer Olympic Games}}

After the success of the 1896 Games, the Olympics entered a period of stagnation that threatened their survival. The Olympic Games held at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exposition in 1900]] and the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] at St. Louis in [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]] were side shows. The Games in Paris did not have a stadium, but were notable for being the first time women took part in the Games. When the St. Louis Games were celebrated roughly 650 athletes participated, but 580 were from the [[United States at the 1904 Summer Olympics|United States]]. The homogeneous nature of these celebrations was a low point for the Olympic Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://proxy.espn.com/oly/summer08/fanguide/history?year=1904 |title= St. Louis 1904 – Overview |publisher= ESPN |accessdate=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Games rebounded when the [[1906 Intercalated Games]] (so-called because they were the second Games held within the third [[Olympiad]]) were held in Athens. These Games were, but are not now, officially recognised by the IOC and no Intercalated Games have been held since. The Games attracted a broad international field of participants and generated great public interest. This marked the beginning of a rise in both the popularity and the size of the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/history/story/2008/05/05/f-olympics-feature-1906.html |title=1906 Olympics mark 10th anniversary of the Olympic revival |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Centre |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=31 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731211554/http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/history/story/2008/05/05/f-olympics-feature-1906.html |archivedate=31 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Winter Games====
{{main article|Winter Olympic Games}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-05472, St. Moritz, Winterolympiade.jpg|upright=0.93|thumb|right|[[Ice hockey]] game during the [[1928 Winter Olympics]] at [[St. Moritz]]]]

The Winter Olympics was created to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically impossible to hold during the Summer Games. Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics. The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities. At the [[list of IOC meetings|1921 Olympic Congress]] in [[Lausanne]], it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games. A winter sports week (it was actually 11&amp;nbsp;days) was held in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]] in [[Chamonix]], France, in connection with the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris Games]] held three months later; this event became the first [[Winter Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name="chamonix" /&gt; Although it was intended that the same country host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned. The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utah.com/olympics/history.htm |title=Winter Olympics History |publisher=Utah Athletic Foundation |accessdate=31 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112071018/http://www.utah.com/olympics/history.htm |archivedate=12 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition was upheld until the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Games]] in [[Albertville]], France; after that, beginning with the [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994 Games]], the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=405}}

====Paralympics====
{{main article|Paralympic Games}}

[[File:031164 - Tokyo opening ceremony -7 - 1a - adjusted.jpg|thumb|[[1964 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Tokyo]]]]
In 1948, [[Ludwig Guttmann|Sir Ludwig Guttmann]], determined to promote the rehabilitation of soldiers after [[World War II]], organised a multi-sport event between several hospitals to coincide with the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London Olympics]]. Guttmann's event, known then as the [[IWAS World Games|Stoke Mandeville Games]], became an annual sports festival. Over the next twelve years, Guttmann and others continued their efforts to use sports as an avenue to healing. For the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games in Rome]], Guttmann brought 400 athletes to compete in the "Parallel Olympics", which became known as the [[1960 Summer Paralympics|first Paralympics]]. Since then, the Paralympics have been held in every Olympic year. Since the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea, the host city for the Olympics has also played host to the Paralympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/7582206.stm |title= History of the Paralympics |publisher= [[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=2 February 2009 | date=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref label|WinterPara|D|a}} In 2001 the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) signed an agreement guaranteeing that host cities would be contracted to manage both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.&lt;ref name="Parahist" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPC-IOC Cooperation |publisher=International Paralympic Committee |url=http://oldwebsite.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC-IOC_Co-operation.html |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519023623/http://oldwebsite.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC-IOC_Co-operation.html |archivedate=19 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement came into effect at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, and the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver.

====Youth Games====
{{main article|Youth Olympic Games}}

In 2010, the Olympic Games were complemented by the Youth Games, which give athletes between the ages of 14 and 18 the chance to compete. The Youth Olympic Games were conceived by IOC president [[Jacques Rogge]] in 2001 and approved during the 119th Congress of the IOC.&lt;ref name="Rogge introduces" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Rice |first= John |url= https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2007-07-05-2774646336_x.htm |title=IOC approves Youth Olympics; first set for 2010 |agency= Associated Press |work= USA Today |date=5 July 2007 |accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics|first Summer Youth Games]] were held in Singapore from 14–26 August 2010, while the [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics|inaugural Winter Games]] were hosted in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innsbruck is the host city for the first Winter Youth Olympic Games|publisher=The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|date=12 December 2008|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/en/news/feature-stories/-/61888/32574/1t8ch2t/innsbruck-is-the-host-city-for.html|accessdate=30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Games will be shorter than the senior Games; the summer version will last twelve days, while the winter version will last nine days.&lt;ref name="CRIonYOG" /&gt; The IOC allows 3,500 athletes and 875 officials to participate at the Summer Youth Games, and 970 athletes and 580 officials at the Winter Youth Games.&lt;ref name="YOGisGo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="No kidding" /&gt; The sports to be contested will coincide with those scheduled for the senior Games, however there will be variations on the sports including mixed NOC and mixed gender teams as well as a reduced number of disciplines and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/summer/2007-07-05-olympic-notes_N.htm |title= IOC votes to start Youth Olympics in 2010 |first= Vicky |last= Michaelis |date= 5 July 2007 |work= USA Today |accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Continental Games====

===21st-century games===
From 241 participants representing 14 nations in 1896, the Games have grown to about 10,500 competitors from 204 nations at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/london-2012-summer-olympics|title=London 2012|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope and scale of the Winter Olympics is smaller. For example, [[Sochi]] hosted 2,873 athletes from 88 nations competing in 98 events during the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. During the Games most athletes and officials are housed in the [[Olympic Village]]. This village is intended to be a self-contained home for all the Olympic participants, and is furnished with cafeterias, health clinics, and locations for religious expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beijing to build convenient Olympic village |url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/cptvenues/venues/headlines/n214262207.shtml |publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad |accessdate=4 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914055027/http://en.beijing2008.cn/cptvenues/venues/headlines/n214262207.shtml |archivedate=14 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC allowed the formation of National Olympic Committees representing nations that did not meet the strict requirements for political sovereignty that other international organisations demand. As a result, colonies and dependencies are permitted to compete at Olympic Games. Examples of this include territories such as [[Puerto Rico]], [[Bermuda]], and [[Hong Kong]], all of which compete as separate nations despite being legally a part of another country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Charter|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723070003/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|archivedate=23 July 2011 |page=61|format=PDF|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current version of the Charter allows for the establishment of new National Olympic Committees to represent nations which qualify as "an independent State recognised by the international community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Olympic Charter |url=http://www.asksam.com/ebooks/releases.asp?doc_handle=135969&amp;file=Olympic-Charter.ask&amp;query=recognised%20by%20the%20international%20community&amp;search=yes |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=17 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502144028/http://www.asksam.com/ebooks/releases.asp?doc_handle=135969&amp;file=Olympic-Charter.ask&amp;query=recognised%20by%20the%20international%20community&amp;search=yes |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it did not allow the formation of National Olympic Committees for [[Sint Maarten]] and [[Curaçao]] when they gained the same constitutional status as [[Aruba]] in 2010, although the IOC had recognised the [[Aruban Olympic Committee]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/executive-board-concludes-first-meeting-of-the-new-year/112731|date=13 January 2011|accessdate=13 January 2011|title=Executive Board concludes first meeting of the new year|publisher=olympic.org ("Official website of the Olympic movement")}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/mr-jose-perurena?articleid=133159|title=Curtain comes down on 123rd IOC Session|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 2012, Netherlands Antilles athletes can choose to represent either the [[Netherlands]] or [[Aruba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/media-resources?articleid=132830|date=1 July 2011|accessdate=23 August 2012 |title=Working meeting between the IOC and the NOCs of the Netherlands Antilles, Aruba and the Netherlands|publisher=olympic.org ("Official website of the Olympic movement")}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost of the Games===
{{see also|Cost of the Olympic Games}}

The Oxford Olympics Study 2016 found that sports-related costs for the Summer Games since 1960 are on average US$5.2 billion and for the Winter Games $3.1 billion. This does not include wider infrastructure costs like roads, urban rail, and airports, which often cost as much or more than the sports-related costs. The most expensive Summer Games are Beijing at US$40-44&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beijing Olympics to cost China 44,000,000,000 dollars |date= 2008-06-08 |publisher= Pravda News|url=http://english.pravda.ru/sports/games/06-08-2008/106003-beijing_olympics-0/|accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; billion and the most expensive Winter Games are Sochi 2014 at US$51 billion.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/09/sochi-2014-olympics-money-corruption |title=Sochi 2014: the costliest Olympics yet but where has all the money gone? |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 2013-10-09|accessdate=2014-02-12|last1=Gibson |first1=Owen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="study"&gt;{{Cite book|ssrn=2804554|title=The Oxford Olympics Study 2016: Cost and Cost Overrun at the Games|last=Flyvbjerg|first=Bent|last2=Stewart|first2=Allison|last3=Budzier|first3=Alexander|publisher=Saïd Business School, University of Oxford|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, costs per athlete are on average US$599,000 for the Summer Games and $1.3 million for the Winter Games. For London 2012, cost per athlete was $1.4 million; for Sochi 2014, $7.9 million.&lt;ref name="study"/&gt;

Where ambitious construction for the 1976 games in [[Montreal]] and 1980 games in Moscow had saddled organisers with expenses greatly in excess of revenues, 1984 host Los Angeles strictly controlled expenses by using existing facilities except a swim stadium and a velodrome that were paid for by corporate sponsors. The Olympic Committee led by [[Peter Ueberroth]] used some of the profits to endow the [[LA84 Foundation]] to promote youth sports in Southern California, educate coaches and maintain a sports library. The 1984 Summer Olympics are often considered the most financially successful modern Olympics.&lt;ref name="financiallySuccessful"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/86729520.html?dids=86729520:86729520&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+28%2C+2001&amp;author=ALAN+ABRAHAMSON&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=L.A.+the+Best+Site%2C+Bid+Group+Insists%3B+Olympics%3A+Despite+USOC+rejection%2C+officials+say+their+plan+was+in+line+with+IOC%27s+call+for+downsizing+of+Games.&amp;pqatl=google|title=LA the Best Site, Bid Group Insists; Olympics: Despite USOC rejection|date=25 July 2004|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=17 August 2008 | first=Alan | last=Abrahamson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Budget overruns are common for the Games. Average overrun for Games since 1960 is 156% in real terms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leahy|first=Joe|title=Brazil's Olympic costs running 51% over budget, report warns|work=Financial Times|date=7 July 2016|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ef122cb6-43d6-11e6-864d-01c0167ff470|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that actual costs turned out to be on average 2.56 times the budget that was estimated at the time of winning the bid to host the Games. Montreal 1976 had the highest cost overrun for Summer Games, and for any Games, at 720%; Lake Placid 1980 had the highest cost overrun for Winter Games, at 324%. London 2012 had a cost overrun of 76%, Sochi 2014 of 289%.&lt;ref name="study"/&gt;

===Economic and social impact on host cities and countries===
Many economists are sceptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasising that such "mega-events" often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/olympic-cities-everywhere/|title=Olympics Everywhere|last=|first=|date=August 2016|work=WIRED|department=Argument|page=19|type=Paper|quote=...hosting the Olympics is almost always a financial disaster for cities in the long term.... Indeed, economists are uncommonly unanimous that hosting the Olympics is a bad bet.|access-date=|via=|vauthors=Greenwell M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=19 January 2011|title=The Olympic Effect|journal=[[Econ. J. (London)|The Economic Journal]]|volume=121|issue=553|pages=652–77|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02407.x|subscription=yes|vauthors=Rose AK, Spiegel MM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong positive effect on the [[Philanthropy#Modern philanthropy|philanthropic contributions of corporations]] headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently. This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1 February 2013|title=Punctuated Generosity: How Mega-events and Natural Disasters Affect Corporate Philanthropy in U.S. Communities|ssrn=2028982|journal=[[Admin.

The Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities; for example, the [[Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions]] reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, M.

''Journal of Management Studies'', 45(6), 1117–1146.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]] were the most expensive Olympic Games in history, costing in excess of US$50 billion. According to a report by the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] that was released at the time of the games, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern [[Krasnodar Krai|Krasnodar region]] of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/economic-impact-winter-olympics-not-great-russia-sochi-stands-gain-1554153|title=The Economic Impact Of The Winter Olympics: Not Great For Russia But Sochi Stands To Gain|date=8 February 2014|work=International Business Times|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But by December 2014, ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that Sochi "now feels like a ghost town", citing the spread-out nature of the stadiums and arenas, the still-unfinished construction, and the overall effects of Russia's political and economic turmoil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/17/sochi-olympics-legacy-city-feels-like-a-ghost-town|title=The Economic Impact Of The Winter Olympics: Not Great For Russia But Sochi Stands To Gain|date=17 December 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, at least four cities withdrew their bids for the [[2022 Winter Olympics]], citing the high costs or the lack of local support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3462070/olympics-winter-2022/|title=Why Nobody Wants to Host the 2022 Winter Olympics|date=3 October 2014|work=Time|accessdate=10 January 2014|first=Lisa|last=Abend}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in only [[Bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics|a two-city race]] between [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Beijing]], [[China]].

==International Olympic Committee==
{{main article|International Olympic Committee}}
[[File:Siege cio.jpg|thumb|I.O.C. headquarters at [[Lausanne]]]]

The Olympic Movement encompasses a large number of national and international sporting organisations and federations, recognised media partners, as well as athletes, officials, judges, and every other person and institution that agrees to abide by the rules of the Olympic Charter.&lt;ref name="movement" /&gt; As the umbrella organisation of the Olympic Movement, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) is responsible for selecting the host city, overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games, updating and approving the sports program, and negotiating sponsorship and broadcasting rights.&lt;ref name="movement roles" /&gt;

The Olympic Movement is made of three major elements:
* [[List of international sport federations|International Federations]] (IFs) are the [[sport governing body|governing bodies]] that supervise a sport at an international level. For example, the International Federation of Association Football ([[FIFA]]) is the IF for association football, and the [[Fédération Internationale de Volleyball]] is the international governing body for volleyball. There are currently 35 IFs in the Olympic Movement, representing each of the Olympic sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For the Good of the Athletes |publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad |date=31 October 2007 |url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/official/ioc/n214186786.shtml |accessdate=4 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123170335/http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/official/ioc/n214186786.shtml |archivedate=23 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs) represent and regulate the Olympic Movement within each country. For example, the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) is the NOC of the United States. There are currently 205 NOCs recognised by the IOC.&lt;ref name="iocfactsheet" /&gt;
* Organising Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs) are temporary committees responsible for the organisation of each Olympic Games. OCOGs are dissolved after each Games once the final report is delivered to the IOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/ioc-governance-organising-committees|title=Organising Committees for the Olympic Games |publisher=Olympic Games|accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French and English are the official languages of the Olympic Movement. The other language used at each Olympic Games is the language of the host country (or languages, if a country has more than one official language apart from French or English). Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these three (or more) languages, or the main two depending on whether the host country is an English or French speaking country: French is always spoken first, followed by an English translation, and then the dominant language of the host nation (when this is not English or French).{{sfn|Olympic Charter|2007|p=53|loc=Rule 24}}

===Criticism===
The IOC has often been criticised for being an intractable organisation, with several members on the committee for life. The presidential terms of [[Avery Brundage]] and [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] were especially controversial. Brundage was president for over 20 years, and during his tenure he protected the Olympics from political involvement and the influence of advertising.{{sfn|Maraniss|2008|pp=52–60}} He was accused of both racism, for [[Apartheid-era South Africa and the Olympics|resisting exclusion of apartheid South Africa]], and [[antisemitism]].{{sfn|Maraniss|2008|pp=60–69}} Under the Samaranch presidency, the office was accused of both [[nepotism]] and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Samaranch Defends Nominating Son for IOC Post |publisher=CBC Sports |date=18 May 2001 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2001/05/18/ioc010516.html |accessdate=4 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205190231/http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2001/05/18/ioc010516.html |archivedate=5 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Samaranch's ties with the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]] in Spain were also a source of criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympics:Barcelona Profile; Samaranch, Under the Gun Shoots Back|last=Riding|first=Alan|date=30 June 1992|work=The New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DB173FF933A05755C0A964958260|accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, it was reported that several IOC members had [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|taken bribes]] from members of the [[Salt Lake City]] bid committee for the hosting of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. Although nothing strictly illegal had been done, it was felt that the acceptance of the gifts was morally dubious. The IOC pursued an investigation which led to the resignation of four members and expulsion of six others. The scandal set off further reforms that changed the way host cities were selected, to avoid similar cases in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge Drops Olympic Bid Case|work=Los Angeles Times|last=Abrahamson|first=Alan|date=6 December 2003|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/06/sports/sp-saltlakecity6|accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1999, it was reported that the [[1998 Winter Olympics|Nagano Olympic]] bid committee had spent approximately $14 million to entertain the 62 IOC members and many of their companions. The precise figures are unknown since Nagano, after the IOC asked that the entertainment expenditures not be made public, destroyed the financial records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

A [[BBC]] documentary entitled ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]: Buying the Games'', aired in August 2004, investigated the taking of bribes in the bidding process for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Buying the Games" /&gt; The documentary claimed it was possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city. After being narrowly defeated in their bid for the 2012 Summer Games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lynn|last=Zinser|title=London Wins 2012 Olympics New York Lags|work=The New York Times|date=7 July 2005|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/sports/othersports/07olympic.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin|accessdate=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of mayors of Paris|Parisian mayor]] [[Bertrand Delanoë]] specifically accused the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and the [[London Bid Committee]] (headed by former Olympic champion [[Sebastian Coe]]) of breaking the bid rules.

The [[Turin]] [[Bids for the 2006 Winter Olympics|bid]] for the 2006 Winter Olympics was also shrouded in controversy. A prominent IOC member, [[Marc Hodler]], strongly connected with the rival bid of [[Sion, Switzerland]], alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organising Committee. These accusations led to a wide-ranging investigation. The allegations also served to sour many IOC members against Sion's bid and potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Howard|last=Berkes|title=How Turin got the Games|publisher=NPR|date=7 February 2006|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5195274|accessdate=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] called the continued refusal by the International Olympic Committee to hold a moment of silence at the opening ceremony for the eleven [[Munich massacre|Israeli athletes killed]] by Palestinian terrorists at the [[1972 Munich Olympics]], "a continuing stubborn insensitivity and callousness to the memory of the murdered Israeli athletes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Committee's Refusal to Honor Munich 11 Mired in 'Stubborn Insensitivity and Callousness'|url=http://archive.adl.org/PresRele/TerrorismIntl_93/Olympic-Committee-Stubborn-Munich-11.htm|publisher=ADL|accessdate=26 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623191956/http://archive.adl.org/PresRele/TerrorismIntl_93/Olympic-Committee-Stubborn-Munich-11.htm|archive-date=23 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercialisation==

===Under national organising committees===
The Olympics have been commercialised to various degrees since the initial [[1896 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, when a number of companies paid for advertising,&lt;ref name="IOC2011Marketing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/IOC_Marketing/OLYMPIC_MARKETING_FACT_FILE_2011.pdf|title=Marketing Fact File, International Olympic Committee, 2011 edition, page 18, accessed 2015-12-22|publisher=|date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Kodak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kodak-olympics-idUSWEN164520071012|title=Kodak to end Olympics sponsorship after 2008 games|date=12 October 2007|agency=Reuters|newspaper=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disruptiveinnovation.se/?p=112|title=No more Kodak moments in the Olympics}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]], Odol mouthwash and Indian Foot Powder became official sponsors of the [[1908 Summer Olympics|London Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/london/2015-12-04/wildly-interesting-facts-you-never-knew-about-london-until-now/|title=Wildly interesting facts about London you never knew, until now|website=ITV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxo.co.uk/about-us|title=OXO – About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://formandsurface.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/odol_6830.html|title=Form and Surface: Odol|author=Alex|date=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coca-Cola]] sponsored the [[1928 Summer Olympics]], and has subsequently remained a sponsor to the current time.&lt;ref name="IOC2011Marketing" /&gt; Before the IOC took control of sponsorship, national organising committees were responsible for negotiating their own contracts for sponsorship and the use of the Olympic symbols.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}}

===Under IOC control===
The IOC originally resisted funding by corporate sponsors. It was not until the retirement of IOC president [[Avery Brundage]], in 1972, that the IOC began to explore the potential of the television medium and the lucrative advertising markets available to them.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} Under the leadership of [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] the Games began to shift toward international sponsors who sought to link their products to the Olympic brand.&lt;ref name="television" /&gt; More than half of the Olympic committee's global sponsors are American companies.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{web cite|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/sports/olympics/russia-olympics-us-business.html|title=Fewer Russians Could Be a Windfall for U.S. Olympic Business|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=7 December 2017|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Budget===
During the first half of the 20th century the [[IOC]] ran on a small budget.&lt;ref name="television" /&gt;{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci}} As president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} Brundage believed the lobby of corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC's decision-making.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant the IOC left organising committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} When Brundage retired the IOC had US$2&amp;nbsp;million in assets; eight years later the IOC coffers had swelled to US$45&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980 his desire was to make the IOC financially independent.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci}}

The [[1984 Summer Olympics]] became a watershed moment in Olympic history. The Los Angeles-based organising committee, led by [[Peter Ueberroth]], was able to generate a surplus of US$225&amp;nbsp;million, which was an unprecedented amount at that time.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=209}} The organising committee had been able to create such a surplus in part by selling exclusive sponsorship rights to select companies.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=209}} The IOC sought to gain control of these sponsorship rights. Samaranch helped to establish The Olympic Programme (TOP) in 1985, in order to create an Olympic brand.&lt;ref name="television" /&gt; Membership in TOP was, and is, very exclusive and expensive. Fees cost US$50&amp;nbsp;million for a four-year membership.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci}} Members of TOP received exclusive global advertising rights for their product category, and use of the Olympic symbol, the [[Olympic rings|interlocking rings]], in their publications and advertisements.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=194}}

===Effect of television===
[[File:Olympic Final 2000 (1936 cartoon).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A cartoon from the [[1936 Berlin Olympics|1936 Olympics]] imagines the year 2000 when spectators will have been replaced by television and radio, their cheers coming from loudspeakers.]]

The [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin were the first Games to be broadcast on television, though only to local audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlin 1936|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1936|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822100804/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1936|archivedate=22 August 2008|accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1956 Winter Olympics]] were the first internationally televised Olympic Games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cortina d'Ampezzo|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&amp;OLGY=1956|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822213008/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&amp;OLGY=1956|archivedate=22 August 2008|accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[1960 Winter Olympics|following Winter Games]] had their broadcasting rights sold for the first time to specialised television broadcasting networks—[[CBS]] paid US$394,000 for the American rights,{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=192}} and the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) allocated US$660,000.&lt;ref name="television" /&gt; In the following decades the Olympics became one of the ideological fronts of the Cold War. Superpowers jockeyed for political supremacy, and the IOC wanted to take advantage of this heightened interest via the broadcast medium.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=192}} The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn created more appeal to advertisers time on television. This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever-increasing fees for those rights.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=192}} For example, CBS paid US$375&amp;nbsp;million for the American broadcast rights of the [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Nagano Games]],{{sfn|Gershon|2000|p=17}} while [[NBC]] spent US$3.5&amp;nbsp;billion for the American rights of all the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012.&lt;ref name="television" /&gt; In 2011, NBC agreed to a $4.38 billion contract with the [[International Olympic Committee]] to broadcast the Olympics through the [[2020 Summer Olympics|2020 games]], the most expensive television rights deal in Olympic history.&lt;ref name="adweek"&gt;{{cite news|title=Update: NBC Bids $4.38 Billion for Olympic Gold|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/update-nbc-bids-438-billion-olympic-gold-132319|author=Anthony Crupi|work=[[Ad Week]]|date=June 7, 2011|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC then agreed to a $7.75 billion contract extension on May 7, 2014, to air the Olympics through the 2032 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympics on NBC through 2032|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2014/05/07/nbc-olympics-broadcast-rights-2032/8805989/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC also acquired the American television rights to the [[Youth Olympic Games]], beginning in [[2014 Summer Youth Olympics|2014]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Olympics on NBC through 2032|url=http://olympictalk.nbcsports.com/2014/08/12/youth-olympics-nbc-coverage-nanjing/|website=[[NBC Sports]]|date=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Paralympic Games]] for the [[2014 Winter Paralympics|2014]] and [[2016 Summer Paralympics|2016]] editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paralympics on NBC in 2014 and 2016|url=http://olympictalk.nbcsports.com/2013/09/24/paralympics-2014-2016-tv-coverage-nbc/|website=NBC Sports|date=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC is one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Viewership increased exponentially from the 1960s until the end of the century. This was due to the use of satellites to broadcast live television worldwide in 1964, and the introduction of [[color television|colour television]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Whannel, G. (1984) The television spectacular in A. Tomlinson &amp; G. Whannel (Eds.), Five-ring circus (pp. 30–43). London: Pluto Press&lt;/ref&gt; Global audience estimates for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Games]] was 600&amp;nbsp;million, whereas at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Games of 1984]], the audience numbers had increased to 900&amp;nbsp;million; that number swelled to 3.5&amp;nbsp;billion by the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona.{{sfn|Tomlinson|2005|p=14}} However, at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Games]] in Sydney, NBC drew the lowest U.S. ratings for any Summer or Winter Olympics since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Series TV ratings slump|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/10/27/sports/main244877.shtml|publisher=CBS News|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=4 May 2009 | date=27 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was attributed to two factors: one was the increased competition from cable channels, the second was the internet, which was able to display results and video in real time. Television companies were still relying on tape-delayed content, which was becoming outdated in the information era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All fall down|last=Walters|first=Walters|work=Sports Illustrated|date=2 October 2000|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1020472/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429222810/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1020472/index.htm|archivedate=29 April 2011|accessdate=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A drop in ratings meant that television studios had to give away free advertising time.&lt;ref name="ratings" /&gt; With such high costs charged to broadcast the Games, the added pressure of the internet, and increased competition from cable, the television lobby demanded concessions from the IOC to boost ratings.{{sfn|Slack|2004|pp=16–18}} The IOC responded by making a number of changes to the Olympic program. At the Summer Games, the gymnastics competition was expanded from seven to nine nights, and a Champions Gala was added to draw greater interest.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=17}} The IOC also expanded the swimming and diving programs, both popular sports with a broad base of television viewers.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=17}} Finally, the American television lobby, namely NBC, was able to dictate when certain events were held so that they could be broadcast live during prime time in the United States, such as swimming and figure skating.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=230}} The results of these efforts were mixed: ratings for the 2006 Winter Games were significantly lower than those for the 2002 Games, while there was a sharp increase in viewership for the 2008 Summer Olympics, and the 2012 Summer Games, where live broadcast in prime time on NBC were little, became the most watched event in US television history.&lt;ref name="ratings" /&gt;{{sfn|Woods|2007|p=146}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London Olympics 2012 Ratings: Most Watched Event In TV History|date=13 August 2012|work=The Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/13/london-olympics-2012-ratings-most-watched-ever_n_1774032.html|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Olympic marketing===
The sale of the Olympic brand has been controversial. The argument is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialised sporting spectacle.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=194}} Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games. The cities were awash in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=cii}} The IOC indicated that they would address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=cii}} Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=194}} Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments.{{sfn|Slack|2004|pp=194–195}} Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2009/wp09-06bk.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, ''The Olympic Effect'', March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
{{main article|Olympic symbols}}
[[File:Olympic-flag-Victoria.jpg|thumb|The [[Olympic flag]]]]

The Olympic Movement uses symbols to represent the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter. The Olympic symbol, better known as the [[Olympic rings]], consists of five intertwined rings and represents the unity of the five inhabited continents ([[Africa]], [[Americas|America]], [[Asia]], [[Australia]] and [[Europe]]). The coloured version of the rings—blue, yellow, black, green, and red—over a white field forms the Olympic flag. These colours were chosen because every nation had at least one of them on its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time only at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in Antwerp, Belgium. It has since been hoisted during each celebration of the Games.&lt;ref name="olympicsymbols" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv10n1/JOHv10n1m.pdf |last=Lennartz |first=Karl |title=The Story of the Rings |journal=Journal of Olympic History |date=2002 |volume=10 |pages=29–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Olympic motto]], ''Citius, Altius, Fortius'', a [[Latin]] expression meaning "Faster, Higher, Stronger" was proposed by [[Pierre de Coubertin]] in 1894 and has been official since 1924. The motto was coined by Coubertin's friend, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest [[Henri Didon]] OP, for a Paris youth gathering of 1891.&lt;ref&gt;"Sport athlétique", 14 mars 1891: "... dans une éloquente allocution il a souhaité que ce drapeau les conduise 'souvent à la victoire, à la lutte toujours'. Il a dit qu'il leur donnait pour devise ces trois mots qui sont le fondement et la raison d'être des sports athlétiques: citius, altius, fortius, 'plus vite, plus haut, plus fort'.", cited in Hoffmane, Simone ''La carrière du père Didon, Dominicain. 1840–1900'', Doctoral thesis, Université de Paris IV – Sorbonne, 1985, p. 926; cf. Michaela Lochmann, ''Les fondements pédagogiques de la devise olympique "citius, altius, fortius"''&lt;/ref&gt;

Coubertin's Olympic ideals are expressed in the [[Olympic creed]]:

{{quote
| The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.&lt;ref name="olympicsymbols" /&gt;
}}

Months before each Games, the [[Olympic Flame]] is lit in Olympia in a ceremony that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a torch by placing it inside a [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic mirror]] which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry the flame to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it plays an important role in the opening ceremony.&lt;ref name="torch" /&gt; Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]], the torch relay was only introduced at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Summer Games]] to promote the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].&lt;ref name="olympicsymbols" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=IOC Investigation |series=Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel |network=HBO |date=26 July 2016 |season=22 |number=7 |url=http://www.hbo.com/real-sports-with-bryant-gumbel/episodes/0/232-episode/index.html}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[List of Olympic mascots|Olympic mascot]], an animal or human figure representing the cultural heritage of the host country, was introduced in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. It has played an important part of the Games' identity promotion since the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], when the Russian bear cub [[Misha]] reached international stardom. The mascot of the Summer Olympics in London was named Wenlock after the town of [[Much Wenlock]] in [[Shropshire]]. Much Wenlock still hosts the Wenlock Olympian Games, which were an inspiration to Pierre de Coubertin for the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Summer Games Mascots from Munich 1972 to London 2012|publisher=International Olympic Committee|format=PDF|date=1 January 2013|url=http://www.olympic.org/assets/osc%20section/pdf/qr_3e.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremonies==
{{main article|Olympic Games ceremony}}

===Opening===
[[File:2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony (15).jpg|thumb|Opening ceremony of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]]]]

As mandated by the [[Olympic Charter]], various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred.&lt;ref name="OCFactSheetS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OCFactSheetW" /&gt; Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp.&lt;ref name="OCprotocol1" /&gt; The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem.&lt;ref name="OCFactSheetS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OCFactSheetW" /&gt; The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theatre representative of its culture.&lt;ref name="OCprotocol1" /&gt; The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100&amp;nbsp;million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2008/08/07/olympics-ceremonies.html |title=Beijing Dazzles: Chinese History, on Parade as Olympics Begin |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Centre |date=8 August 2008 |accessdate=9 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906200510/http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2008/08/07/olympics-ceremonies.html |archivedate=6 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the artistic portion of the ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. Greece is traditionally the first nation to enter in order to honour the origins of the Olympics. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's chosen language, with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. During the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], which was hosted in [[Athens|Athens, Greece]], the Greek flag entered the stadium first, while the Greek delegation entered last. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Olympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier, often a successful Olympic athlete from the host nation, who lights the Olympic flame in the stadium's cauldron.&lt;ref name="OCFactSheetS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OCFactSheetW" /&gt;

===Closing===
[[File:Birdsclosing.jpg|thumb|left|Athletes gather in the stadium during the closing ceremony of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]].]]

The closing ceremony of the Olympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction.&lt;ref name="IOCclosingProtocol"&gt;{{cite web |title=Closing Ceremony Factsheet|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|date=5 June 2012|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/Closing_Ceremony_of_the_Games.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three national flags are hoisted while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of the current host country; the flag of Greece, to honour the birthplace of the Olympic Games; and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games.&lt;ref name="IOCclosingProtocol"/&gt; The president of the organising committee and the IOC president make their closing speeches, the Games are officially closed, and the Olympic flame is extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Closing Ceremony |publisher=International Olympic Committee |date=31 January 2002 |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_268.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gKmkOYeD?url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_268.pdf |archivedate=26 April 2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=27 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In what is known as the Antwerp Ceremony, the mayor of the city that organised the Games transfers a special Olympic flag to the president of the IOC, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/en/news/feature-stories/-/38344/32574/w6rlej/the-olympic-flags-and-emblem.html |title=The Olympic Flags and Emblem |publisher=The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|accessdate=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theatre representative of its culture.&lt;ref name="IOCclosingProtocol"/&gt;

As is customary, the last medal presentation of the Games is held as part of the closing ceremony. Typically, the men's marathon medals are presented at the Summer Olympics,&lt;ref name="IOCclosingProtocol"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Latest: Rio Games close with samba-fueled Carnival party|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune|agency=Associated Press|date=21 August 2016|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-the-latest-mens-marathon-underway-on-last-day-of-2016aug21-story.html|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the cross-country skiing mass start medals are awarded at the Winter Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Closing Ceremonies of the Olympic Game|publisher=International Olympic Committee|date=1 June 2014|url=https://www.olympic.org/closing-ceremonies|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
{{main article|Olympic sports}}

The [[Olympic sports|Olympic Games programme]] consists of 35 sports, 30 disciplines and 408 events. For example, [[Wrestling at the Summer Olympics|wrestling]] is a Summer Olympic sport, comprising two disciplines: [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] and [[Freestyle wrestling|Freestyle]]. It is further broken down into fourteen events for men and four events for women, each representing a different weight class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrestling |publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad |url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/sports/wrestling/ |accessdate=25 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226194816/http://en.beijing2008.cn/sports/wrestling/ |archivedate=26 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Summer Olympics programme includes 26 sports, while the Winter Olympics programme features 15 sports.&lt;ref name="Sports" /&gt; [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Athletics]], [[Swimming at the Summer Olympics|swimming]], [[Fencing at the Summer Olympics|fencing]], and [[Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics|artistic gymnastics]] are the only summer sports that have never been absent from the Olympic programme. [[Cross-country skiing at the Winter Olympics|Cross-country skiing]], [[Figure skating at the Olympic Games|figure skating]], [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|ice hockey]], [[Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics|Nordic combined]], [[Ski jumping at the Winter Olympics|ski jumping]], and [[Speed skating at the Winter Olympics|speed skating]] have been featured at every Winter Olympics programme since its inception in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]]. Current Olympic sports, like [[Badminton at the Summer Olympics|badminton]], [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|basketball]], and [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|volleyball]], first appeared on the programme as [[demonstration sport]]s, and were later promoted to full Olympic sports. Some sports that were featured in earlier Games were later dropped from the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/past/index_uk.asp |title=Olympic Sports of the Past |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olympic sports are governed by [[List of international sport federations|international sports federations]] (IFs) recognised by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC.{{sfn|Olympic Charter|2007|pp=88–90}} There are sports recognised by the IOC that are not included on the Olympic program. These sports are not considered Olympic sports, but they can be promoted to this status during a programme revision that occurs in the first IOC session following a celebration of the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/if/index_uk.asp |title=International Sports Federations |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Olympic Charter|2007|p=87}} During such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the programme on the basis of a two-thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_942.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429094118/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_942.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2011 |title=Factsheet: The sessions |publisher=International Olympic Committee |format=PDF |page=1 |accessdate=8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are recognised sports that have never been on an Olympic programme in any capacity, including chess and surfing.&lt;ref name="recognizedsports" /&gt;

In October and November 2004, the IOC established an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic programme and all non-Olympic recognised sports. The goal was to apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic programme for each celebration of the Games.&lt;ref name="factsheetsports" /&gt; The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic programme.&lt;ref name="factsheetsports" /&gt; These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport.&lt;ref name="factsheetsports" /&gt; From this study five recognised sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby union, roller sports and squash.&lt;ref name="factsheetsports" /&gt; These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash.&lt;ref name="factsheetsports" /&gt; Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic programme.&lt;ref name="factsheetsports" /&gt; In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] and [[2020 Summer Olympics|2020 Summer Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name="newosports" /&gt;

The 114th [[List of IOC meetings|IOC Session]], in 2002, limited the Summer Games programme to a maximum of 28 sports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes.&lt;ref name="factsheetsports" /&gt; Three years later, at the [[117th IOC Session]], the first major programme revision was performed, which resulted in the exclusion of [[Baseball at the Summer Olympics|baseball]] and [[Softball at the Summer Olympics|softball]] from the official programme of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Games]]. Since there was no agreement in the promotion of two other sports, the 2012 programme featured just 26 sports.&lt;ref name="factsheetsports" /&gt; The 2016 and 2020 Games will return to the maximum of 28 sports given the addition of rugby and golf.&lt;ref name="newosports" /&gt;

===Amateurism and professionalism===
{{further information|Amateur sports}}
[[File:Nagano 1998-Russia vs Czech Republic.jpg|thumb|left|Professional [[National Hockey League|NHL]] players were allowed to participate in [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|ice hockey]] starting in 1998 (''1998 Gold medal game between Russia and the Czech Republic pictured'').]]

The [[ethos]] of the aristocracy as exemplified in the [[public school (United Kingdom)|English public school]] greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120–123}} The public schools subscribed to the belief that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying ''[[mens sana in corpore sano]]'', a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120–123}} Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120–123}}

The exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were thus considered professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1936 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/garmisch-partenkirchen-1936-winter-olympics |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As class structure evolved through the 20th century, the definition of the amateur athlete as an aristocratic gentleman became outdated.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120–123}} The advent of the state-sponsored "full-time amateur athlete" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schantz |first=Otto |title=The Olympic Ideal and the Winter Games Attitudes Towards the Olympic Winter Games in Olympic Discourses – from Coubertin to Samaranch |publisher=Comité International Pierre De Coubertin |url=http://coubertin.org/docs/Winter%20Games%20Schantz.pdf |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919124001/http://coubertin.org/docs/Winter%20Games%20Schantz.pdf |archive-date=19 September 2016 |dead-url=no |accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, amateurism requirements were gradually phased out of the Olympic Charter. After the 1988 Games, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics, subject to the approval of the IFs.&lt;ref name="Amateurism" /&gt;

====Team Canada====
Near the end of the 1960s, the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] (CAHA) felt their amateur players could no longer be competitive against the Soviet team's full-time athletes and the other constantly improving European teams. They pushed for the ability to use players from professional leagues but met opposition from the IIHF and IOC. [[Avery Brundage]], president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, was opposed to the idea of amateur and professional players competing together. At the IIHF Congress in 1969, the IIHF decided to allow Canada to use nine non-NHL professional hockey players&lt;ref name="Num17"&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|Szemberg|2008}}, [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-17.html Story #17 – Protesting amateur rules, Canada leaves international hockey].&lt;/ref&gt; at the 1970 World Championships in [[Montreal]] and [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|Szemberg|2008}}, [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-40.html Story #40 – Finally, Canada to host the World Championship].&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was reversed in January 1970 after Brundage said that ice hockey's status as an Olympic sport would be in jeopardy if the change was made.&lt;ref name="Num17" /&gt; In response, Canada withdrew from international ice hockey competition and officials stated that they would not return until "open competition" was instituted.&lt;ref name="Num17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Summit Series '72 Summary |publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]] |url=http://www.hhof.com/html/GamesSummarySUM1972.shtml |accessdate=2 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807130920/http://www.hhof.com/html/GamesSummarySUM1972.shtml |archivedate=7 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Günther Sabetzki]] became president of the IIHF in 1975 and helped to resolve the dispute with the CAHA. In 1976, the IIHF agreed to allow "open competition" between all players in the World Championships. However, NHL players were still not allowed to play in the Olympics until 1988, because of the IOC's amateur-only policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|Szemberg|2008}}, [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-6.html Story #6 – First Canada Cup opens up the hockey world].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greece]], [[Australia]], [[France]], and [[United Kingdom]] are the only countries to be represented at every Olympic Games since their inception in 1896. While countries sometimes miss an Olympics due to a lack of qualified athletes, some choose to boycott a celebration of the Games for various reasons. The [[Olympic Council of Ireland]] boycotted the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Games]], because the IOC insisted its team needed to be restricted to the [[Irish Free State]] rather than representing the entire island of Ireland.{{r|Krüger Murray 2003 p230}}

There were three boycotts of the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Olympics]]: the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], and [[Switzerland]] refused to attend because of the repression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian uprising]] by the [[Soviet Union]], but did send an equestrian delegation to Stockholm; [[Cambodia]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], and [[Lebanon]] boycotted the Games because of the [[Suez Crisis]]; and [[China]] (the "People's Republic of China") boycotted the Games because [[Taiwan]] was allowed to compete in the Games as the "Republic of China".&lt;ref name="Boycott 1" /&gt;

In [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] a large number of African countries threatened the IOC with a boycott to force them to ban [[South Africa]] and [[Rhodesia]], because of their [[racial segregation|segregationist]] regimes. [[New Zealand]] was also one of the African boycott targets, because [[New Zealand national rugby union team|its national rugby union team]] had toured [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]]-ruled South Africa. The IOC conceded in the first two cases, but refused to ban New Zealand on the grounds that rugby was not an Olympic sport.&lt;ref name="CBC boycott" /&gt; Fulfilling their threat, twenty African countries were joined by [[Guyana]] and Iraq in a withdrawal from the Montreal Games, after a few of their athletes had already competed.&lt;ref name="CBC boycott" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1976/ore109/ore109h.pdf |title=Africa and the XXIst Olympiad |journal=Olympic Review |issue=109–110 |pages=584–585 |date=November–December 1976 |format=PDF |accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwan was excluded from the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 games]] by order of [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]], the prime minister of Canada. Trudeau's action was widely condemned as having brought shame on Canada for having succumbed to political pressure to keep the delegation from the Republic of China (ROC) from competing under that name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/02722019109481098|title = Trudeau, Taiwan, and the 1976 Montreal Olympics|journal = American Review of Canadian Studies|volume = 21|issue = 4|pages = 423–448|year = 1991|last1 = MacIntosh|first1 = Donald|last2 = Greenhorn|first2 = Donna|last3 = Hawes|first3 = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROC refused a proposed compromise that would have still allowed them to use the [[flag of the Republic of China|ROC flag]] and [[National Anthem of the Republic of China|anthem]] as long as the name was changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1976/ore107/ore107i.pdf |title=Game playing in Montreal |journal=Olympic Review |pages=461–462 |issue=107–108 |date=October 1976 |format=PDF |accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan did not participate again until 1984, when it returned under the name of Chinese Taipei and with a special flag and anthem.&lt;ref name="corbit" /&gt;

In 1980 and 1984, the [[Cold War]] opponents boycotted each other's Games. The [[United States]] and sixty-five other countries boycotted the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow Olympics in 1980]] because of the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. This boycott reduced the number of nations participating to 80, the lowest number since 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/moscow-1980-summer-olympics |title=Moscow 1980|publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union and 15 other nations countered by boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics of 1984]], contending that they could not guarantee the safety of their athletes. Although a  boycott led by the Soviet Union depleted the field in certain sports, 140 National Olympic Committees took part, which was a record at the time.&lt;ref name="olympic.org"/&gt; The fact that Romania, a Warsaw Pact country, opted to compete despite Soviet demands led to a warm reception of the Romanian team by the United States. When the Romanian athletes entered during the opening ceremonies, they received a standing ovation from the spectators, which comprised mostly U.S. citizens. The boycotting nations of the Eastern Bloc staged their own alternate event, the [[Friendship Games]], in July and August.&lt;ref name="1980 Boycott" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1980 Boycott 2" /&gt;

There had been growing calls for boycotts of Chinese goods and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing in protest of China's [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights record]], and in response to [[2008 Tibetan unrest|Tibetan disturbances]]. Ultimately, no nation supported a boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia: Calls to Boycott Beijing Olympics |work=Inter Press Service |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41699 |accessdate=10 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912023227/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41699 |archivedate=12 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EUTibet" /&gt; In August 2008, the government of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] called for a boycott of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], set to be held in [[Sochi]], Russia, in response to Russia's participation in the [[2008 South Ossetia war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0711/p06s01-woeu.html |title=Putin Faces Green Olympic Challenge: The Sochi 2014 Winter Games are threatened by a looming international boycott, environmental concerns, and public protests against local development |journal=Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=18 August 2008 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822014059/http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0711/p06s01-woeu.html |archivedate=22 August 2009 |df= |date=2008-07-11 }}, ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.

===Politics===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-G00630, Sommerolympiade, Siegerehrung Weitsprung.jpg|thumb|Jesse Owens on the podium after winning the long jump at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]]]

The Olympic Games have been used as a platform to promote political ideologies almost from its inception. Nazi Germany wished to portray the [[Nazism|National Socialist Party]] as benevolent and peace-loving when they hosted the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Games]], though they used the Games to display [[Aryan]] superiority.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=107}} Germany was the most successful nation at the Games, which did much to support their allegations of [[Aryan]] supremacy, but notable victories by African American [[Jesse Owens]], who won four gold medals, and [[Hungary at the 1936 Summer Olympics|Hungarian]] Jew [[Ibolya Csák]], blunted the message.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|pp=111–112}} The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] did not participate until the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. Instead, starting in 1928, the Soviets organised an international sports event called [[Spartakiad]]s. During the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s, communist and socialist organisations in several countries, including the United States, attempted to counter what they called the "bourgeois" Olympics with the [[Socialist Workers' Sport International|Workers Olympics]].&lt;ref name="GSE" /&gt;{{sfn|Roche|2000|p=106}} It was not until the [[Soviet Union at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Games]] that the Soviets emerged as a sporting superpower and, in doing so, took full advantage of the publicity that came with winning at the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1974/ore84/ore84k.pdf |title=The USSR and Olympism |journal=[[Olympic Review]] |issue=84 |pages=530–557 |date=October 1974 |format=PDF |accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet Union's success might be attributed to a heavy state's investment in sports to fulfill its political agenda on an international stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/|title=The Role of Sports in The Soviet Union |publisher= Guided History|author=|date=|website=blogs.bu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;

Individual athletes have also used the Olympic stage to promote their own political agenda. At the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in Mexico City, two American track and field athletes, [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]], who finished first and third in the 200&amp;nbsp;metres, performed the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|Black Power salute]] on the victory stand. The second-place finisher, [[Peter Norman]] of Australia, wore an [[Olympic Project for Human Rights]] badge in support of Smith and Carlos. In response to the protest, IOC president [[Avery Brundage]] told the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) to either send the two athletes home or withdraw the track and field team. The USOC opted for the former.&lt;ref name="Black Salute" /&gt; During the same Olympics, [[Czechoslovakia]]n gymnast [[Věra Čáslavská]] announced her protest to the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet-led invasion]] of her home country after controversially receiving silver on the [[Balance beam|beam]] and a shared gold on the [[Floor (gymnastics)|floor]]. During the Soviet anthem, Čáslavská turned her head down and to the right of the Soviet flag in order to make a statement over the invasion and the Soviet influence of the sport of [[gymnastics]]. Returning home, Čáslavská was made an outcast by the Soviet government and was banned from competition and travelling.

Currently, the government of Iran has taken steps to avoid any competition between its athletes and those from Israel. An Iranian [[judoka]], [[Arash Miresmaeili]], did not compete in a match against an Israeli during the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. Although he was officially disqualified for being overweight, Miresmaeli was awarded US$125,000 in prize money by the Iranian government, an amount paid to all Iranian gold medal winners. He was officially cleared of intentionally avoiding the bout, but his receipt of the prize money raised suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iranian Judoka rewarded after snubbing Israeli |agency=Associated Press |publisher=NBC Sports |date=8 September 2004|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5942871/ |accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of performance-enhancing drugs===
{{main article|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games}}
[[File:Marathon Hicks1904.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Hicks (athlete)|Thomas Hicks]] running the [[marathon]] at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]]]
In the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs to improve their athletic abilities. For example, in 1904, [[Thomas Hicks (athlete)|Thomas Hicks]], a gold medallist in the marathon, was given [[strychnine]] by his coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Hicks|publisher=Sports-reference.com|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/hi/tom-hicks-1.html|accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only Olympic death linked to performance enhancing occurred at the 1960 Rome games. A Danish cyclist, [[Knud Enemark Jensen]], fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry found that he was under the influence of [[amphetamines]].&lt;ref name="wadahistory" /&gt; By the mid-1960s, sports federations started to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sharon|last=Begley|title=The Drug Charade|work=Newsweek|date=7 January 2008|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/86079/output/print|accessdate=27 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to British journalist [[Andrew Jennings]], a [[KGB]] colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the [[International Olympic Committee]] to undermine [[doping test]]s and that Soviet athletes were "rescued with [these] tremendous efforts".&lt;ref name=DG2011/&gt; On the topic of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], a 1989 Australian study said "There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists' Games."&lt;ref name=DG2011&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0292739575 |title= Drug Games: The International Olympic Committee and the Politics of Doping |first= Thomas M. |last= Hunt |year= 2011 |publisher= University of Texas Press |isbn= 978-0292739574 |page= 66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country's decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements.&lt;ref name=NYT160813/&gt; The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping program prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name=NYT160813&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html |title=The Soviet Doping Plan: Document Reveals Illicit Approach to ’84 Olympics |last=Ruiz |first=Rebecca R. |date= 13 August 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=3 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance-enhancing drugs was [[Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall]], a Swedish [[modern pentathlon|pentathlete]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use.{{sfn|Porterfield|2008|p=15}} One of the  most publicised doping-related disqualifications occurred after the  [[1988 Summer Olympics]] where Canadian sprinter, [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson]] (who won the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metres|100-metre dash]]) tested  positive for [[stanozolol]]. His gold medal was later stripped and awarded to the American runner-up [[Carl Lewis]], who himself had tested positive for banned substances prior to the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jacquelin|last=Magnay|title=Carl Lewis's positive test covered up|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/17/1050172709693.html|date=18 April 2003|accessdate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the IOC formed the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) in an effort to systematise the research and detection of performance-enhancing drugs. There was a sharp increase in positive drug tests at the 2000 Summer Olympics and [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. Several medallists in weightlifting and cross-country skiing were disqualified because of doping offences. During the 2006 Winter Olympics, only one athlete failed a drug test and had a medal revoked. The IOC-established drug testing regimen (now known as the Olympic Standard) has set the worldwide benchmark that other sporting federations attempt to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Zachary|last=Coile|title=Bill Seeks to Toughen Drug Testing in Pro Sports|date=27 April 2005|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/04/27/MNGMICG0SS1.DTL|accessdate=3 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Beijing games, 3,667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Both urine and blood tests were used to detect banned substances. Several athletes were barred from competition by their National Olympic Committees prior to the Games; only three athletes failed drug tests while in competition in Beijing.&lt;ref name="wadahistory" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doping: 3667 athletes tested, IOC seeks action against Halkia's coach |date=19 August 2008 |publisher=Express India Newspapers |url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Doping-3667-athletes-tested-IOC-seeks-action-against-Halkias-coach/350677/ |accessdate=28 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201114743/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Doping-3667-athletes-tested-IOC-seeks-action-against-Halkias-coach/350677/ |archivedate=1 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In London over 6,000 Olympic and Paralympic athletes were tested.

Russia was partially banned from the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] and completely banned from the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] due to the state-sponsored doping program.

===Sex discrimination===
{{main article|Participation of women in the Olympics}}
[[File:Charlotte Cooper.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Charlotte Cooper (tennis)|Charlotte Cooper]] of the [[Great Britain at the Olympics|United Kingdom]], first woman Olympic champion, in the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Games]]]]

Women were first allowed to compete at the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] in Paris, but at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] 35 countries were still only fielding all-male delegations.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; This number dropped rapidly over the following years. In 2000, [[Bahrain at the Olympics|Bahrain]] sent two women competitors for the first time: [[Fatema Hameed Gerashi]] and [[Mariam Mohamed Hadi Al Hilli]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/news/2000/09/23/anderson_arab_women/ "Arab women make breakthrough at Games"], CNN, 23 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Robina Muqimyar]] and [[Fariba Rezayee]] became the first women to compete for [[Afghanistan|Afghanistan at the Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3826673.stm "Afghan women's Olympic dream"], BBC, 22 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[United Arab Emirates at the Olympics|United Arab Emirates]] sent female athletes ([[Maitha bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Maitha Al Maktoum]] competed in taekwondo, and [[Latifa bint Ahmed Al Maktoum|Latifa Al Maktoum]] in equestrian) to the Olympic Games for the first time. Both athletes were from [[Al Maktoum|Dubai's ruling family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Should Saudi Arabia be Banned from the Olympics? |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-wallechinsky/should-saudi-arabia-be-ba_b_115736.html |work=The Huffington Post |date=29 July 2008 |first=David |last=Wallechinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, only three countries had never sent female athletes to the Games: [[Brunei at the Olympics|Brunei]], [[Saudi Arabia at the Olympics|Saudi Arabia]], and [[Qatar at the Olympics|Qatar]]. Brunei had taken part in only three celebrations of the Games, sending a single athlete on each occasion, but Saudi Arabia and Qatar had been competing regularly with all-male teams. In 2010, the International Olympic Committee announced it would "press" these countries to enable and facilitate the participation of women for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. [[Anita DeFrantz]], chair of the IOC's Women and Sports Commission, suggested that countries be barred if they prevented women from competing. Shortly thereafter, the [[Qatar Olympic Committee]] announced that it "hoped to send up to four female athletes in [[Shooting at the 2012 Summer Olympics|shooting]] and [[Fencing at the 2012 Summer Olympics|fencing]]" to the 2012 Summer Games in London.

In 2008, [[Ali Al-Ahmed]], director of the [[Institute for Gulf Affairs]], likewise called for Saudi Arabia to be barred from the Games, describing its ban on women athletes as a violation of the International Olympic Committee charter. He noted: "For the last 15 years, many international nongovernmental organisations worldwide have been trying to lobby the IOC for better enforcement of its own laws banning gender discrimination.&amp;nbsp;... While their efforts did result in increasing numbers of women Olympians, the IOC has been reluctant to take a strong position and threaten the discriminating countries with suspension or expulsion."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; In July 2010, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported: "Pressure is growing on the International Olympic Committee to kick out Saudi Arabia, who are likely to be the only major nation not to include women in their Olympic team for 2012.&amp;nbsp;... Should Saudi Arabia&amp;nbsp;... send a male-only team to London, we understand they will face protests from equal rights and women's groups which threaten to disrupt the Games".&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk" /&gt;

At the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]] in [[London]], [[Great Britain]], for the first time in Olympic history, every country competing included female athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudis to send 2 women to London, make history |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/olympics/2012/07/12/saudi-arabia-women-london-olympics.ap/index.html |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=13 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715100639/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/olympics/2012/07/12/saudi-arabia-women-london-olympics.ap/index.html |archivedate=15 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia included two female athletes in its delegation; Qatar, four; and Brunei, one ([[Maziah Mahusin]], in the 400m hurdles).

The only sport on the Olympic programme that features men and women competing together is the equestrian disciplines. There is no "Women's Eventing", or 'Men's Dressage'. As of 2008, there were still more medal events for men than women. With the addition of women's boxing to the programme in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], however, female athletes were able to compete in all the same sports as men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympic_games/8196879.stm "Women's boxing gains Olympic spot"], BBC, 13 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter Olympics, women are still unable to compete in the [[Nordic combined]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mather|first=Victor|title=Desperately Seeking Skiers for a Budding Olympic Sport|work=The New York Times|date=21 February 2018|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/sports/olympics/womens-nordic-combined.html|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently two Olympic events in which male athletes may not compete: [[synchronized swimming|synchronised swimming]] and [[rhythmic gymnastics]].

===War and terrorism===
Three [[Olympiad]]s had to pass without a celebration of the Games because of war: the [[1916 Summer Olympics|1916 Games]] were cancelled because of [[World War I]], and the summer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of World War II. The [[Russo-Georgian War]] between [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]] erupted on the opening day of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing. Both [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] and [[Vladimir Putin|Prime Minister Putin]] were attending the Olympics at that time and spoke together about the conflict at a luncheon hosted by [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese president]] [[Hu Jintao]].&lt;ref name="MSNBC 2009-01-30" /&gt; When [[Nino Salukvadze]] of Georgia won the bronze medal in the [[Shooting at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Women's 10 metre air pistol|10&amp;nbsp;metre air pistol]] competition, she stood on the medal podium with [[Natalia Paderina]], a Russian shooter who had won the silver. In what became a much-publicised event from the Beijing Games, Salukvadze and Paderina embraced on the podium after the ceremony had ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympic Shooters Hug as their Countries do Battle|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/10/olympic.embrace/|accessdate=10 August 2008 | date=10 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorism most directly affected the Olympic Games in 1972. When the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Summer Games]] were held in [[Munich]], Germany, eleven members of the [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Israeli Olympic team]] were taken hostage by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|Palestinian]] terrorist group [[Black September Organization|Black September]] in what is now known as the [[Munich massacre]]. The terrorists killed two of the athletes soon after they had taken them hostage and killed the other nine during a failed liberation attempt. A German police officer and five terrorists also perished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympic archive|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-41-1289-7332/sports/olympics_cbc/clip5|accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the selection of [[Barcelona]], Spain to host the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], the separatist [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] terrorist organisation launched attacks in the region, including the [[1991 Vic bombing]] that killed ten people in a town that would also hold events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1992/0401/01061.html | title=Spain Tackles Terrorist Threat by Basques to Olympics, Expo| journal=Christian Science Monitor| date=April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1991/08/11/the-threat-to-the-games-in-spain/37be840c-3424-4451-b037-151a53bf2491/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.35fd4d04e7ab | title=The Threat to the Games in Spain| newspaper=Washington Post| date=1991-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorism affected the last two Olympic Games held in the United States. During the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics in 1996]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], a [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|bomb]] was detonated at the [[Centennial Olympic Park]], which killed two and injured 111 others. The bomb was set by [[Eric Rudolph]], an [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|American domestic terrorist]], who is currently serving a life sentence for the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympic Park Bombing|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9607/27/olympic.bomb.main|accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]], took place just five months after the [[September 11 attacks]], which meant a higher level of security than ever before provided for an Olympic Games. The opening ceremonies of the Games featured symbols of the [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks|day's events]]. They included the flag that flew at [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]], [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officer [[Daniel Rodríguez (tenor)|Daniel Rodríguez]] singing "[[God Bless America]]", and honour guards of NYPD and [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]] members. The events of that day have made security at the Olympic Games an increasing concern for Olympic planners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazettenet.com/2011/05/03/ioc-bin-laden-killing-no-bearing-olympic-security|title=IOC on bin Laden killing: no bearing on Olympic security|date=3 May 2011|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Gazettenet.com|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonialism===
{{Main article|Colonialism and the Olympic Games}}
The Olympic Games have been criticised as upholding (and in some cases increasing) the [[Colonialism|colonial]] policies and practices of some host nations and cities either in the name of the Olympics by associated parties or directly by official Olympic bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, host organising committees and official sponsors. Critics have argued that the Olympics have engaged in or caused erroneous anthropological and colonial knowledge production, erasure, commodification&lt;ref&gt;Definition: "…the process of transforming an object, idea, activity, or service into a commodity by capitalist economies." Beaster-Jones 2013, par. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of indigenous ceremonies and symbolism, theft and inappropriate display of indigenous objects, further encroachment on and support of the theft of indigenous lands, and neglect and/or intensification of poor social conditions for indigenous peoples. Such practices have been observed at the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri]]; the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec]]; the [[1988 Winter Olympics|1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta]]; and the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia]].

==Citizenship==

===IOC rules for citizenship===
The Olympic Charter requires that an athlete be a national of the country for which they compete. Dual nationals may compete for either country, as long as three years have passed since the competitor competed for the former country. However, if the NOCs and IF involved agree, then the IOC Executive Board may reduce or cancel this period.{{r|Olympic Charter 2011}} This waiting period exists only for athletes who previously competed for one nation and want to compete for another. If an athlete gains a new or second nationality, then they do not need to wait any designated amount of time before participating for the new or second nation. The IOC is only concerned with issues of citizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes.{{sfn|Shachar|2011|pp=2114–2116}}

===Reasons for changing citizenship===
Athletes will sometimes become citizens of a different nation so they are able to compete in the Olympics. This is often because they are drawn to sponsorships or training facilities in such places as the United States. It could also be because an athlete is unable to qualify from within their original country. The athlete may not qualify because there are already qualified athletes in the athlete's home country. Between 1992 and 2008, about fifty athletes emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

===Citizenship changes and disputes===
One of the most famous cases of changing nationality for the Olympics was [[Zola Budd]], a South African runner who emigrated to the United Kingdom because there was an apartheid-era ban on the Olympics in South Africa. Budd was eligible for British citizenship because her grandfather was born in Britain, but British citizens accused the government of expediting the citizenship process for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rory Carroll |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/feb/24/athletics.rorycarroll |title=What Zola Budd did next |work=The Guardian |date= 24 February 2003 |accessdate=27 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable examples include Kenyan runner [[Bernard Lagat]], who became a United States citizen in May 2004. The Kenyan constitution required that one renounce their Kenyan citizenship when they became a citizen of another nation. Lagat competed for Kenya in the 2004 Athens Olympics even though he had already become a United States citizen. According to Kenya, he was no longer a Kenyan citizen, jeopardising his silver medal. Lagat said he started the citizenship process in late 2003 and did not expect to become an American citizen until after the Athens games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/3/3_1/lagat-a-runner-without-a-.shtml |title=Lagat a runner without a country |publisher=Cool Running |accessdate=27 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519082947/http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/3/3_1/lagat-a-runner-without-a-.shtml |archivedate=19 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Champions and medallists==
{{further information|Lists of Olympic medallists|List of multiple Olympic gold medalists}}

The athletes or teams who place first, second, or third in each event receive medals. The winners receive gold medals, which were solid gold until 1912, then made of gilded silver and now gold-plated silver. Every gold medal however must contain at least six grams of pure gold.&lt;ref name="BeijingOlymp-1" /&gt; The runners-up receive silver medals and the third-place athletes are awarded bronze medals. In events contested by a [[single-elimination tournament]] (most notably boxing), third place might not be determined and both semifinal losers receive bronze medals. At the [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Olympics]] only the first two received a medal; silver for first and bronze for second. The current three-medal format was introduced at the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/st-louis-1904-summer-olympics|title=St Louis 1904|publisher=Olympic Games|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1948 onward athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth have received certificates, which became officially known as victory diplomas; in 1984 victory diplomas for seventh- and eighth-place finishers were added. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the gold, silver, and bronze medal winners were also given olive wreaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Modern Olympic Games|publisher=The Olympic Museum|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906225419/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf|archivedate=6 September 2008|dead-url=yes|accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOC does not keep statistics of medals won on a national level (except for team sports), but NOCs and the media record medal statistics as a measure of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Munro|first=James|title=Britain may aim for third in 2012|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 August 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/7579901.stm|accessdate=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nations==

===Nations at the Summer Olympics===
{{main article|List of participating nations at the Summer Olympic Games}}
As of the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Games]] in Rio de Janeiro, all of the current 206 NOCs and 19 obsolete NOCs have participated in at least one edition of the Summer Olympics. Competitors from [[Australia]], [[France]],{{ref label|FRA|A|a}} [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]],{{ref label|GBR|B|a}} [[Greece]], and [[Switzerland]]{{ref label|SWI|C|a}} have competed in all twenty-eight [[Summer Olympic Games]]. Athletes competing under the Olympic flag, Mixed Teams and the [[Refugee Olympic Team at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Refugee Team]] have between them competed at six Games.

===Nations at the Winter Olympics===
{{main article|List of participating nations at the Winter Olympic Games}}
119 NOCs (110 of the current 206 NOCs and 9 obsolete NOCs) have participated in at least one Winter Games, and athletes from fournteen nations ([[Austria]], [[Canada]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United States]]) have participated in all twenty-three Winter Games to date.

===Host nations and cities===
[[File:Summer olympics all cities.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of Summer Olympics locations. Countries that have hosted one Summer Olympics are shaded green, while countries that have hosted two or more are shaded blue.]]
[[File:Winter olympics all cities.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of Winter Olympics locations. Countries that have hosted one Winter Olympics are shaded green, while countries that have hosted two or more are shaded blue.]]
{{main article|List of Olympic Games host cities}}{{see also|List of Olympic medals by host nation}}

The host city for an Olympic Games is usually chosen seven to eight years ahead of their celebration.&lt;ref name="bidpro" /&gt; The process of selection is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can be presented to the International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organisation of the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name="hostcity" /&gt; In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee.&lt;ref name="bidpro" /&gt; The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialised group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.&lt;ref name="hostcity" /&gt;

Once the candidate cities are selected, they must submit to the IOC a bigger and more detailed presentation of their project as part of a candidature file. Each city is thoroughly analysed by an evaluation commission. This commission will also visit the candidate cities, interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites, and submit a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC's final decision. During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that it will be able to fund the Games.&lt;ref name="bidpro" /&gt; After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running. The IOC members gathered in the Session have the final vote on the host city. Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC, officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.&lt;ref name="bidpro" /&gt;

By 2016, the Olympic Games will have been hosted by 44 cities in 23 countries, but by cities outside Europe and North America on only eight occasions. Since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, the Olympics have been held in Asia or Oceania four times, a sharp increase compared to the previous 92&amp;nbsp;years of modern Olympic history. The 2016 Games in [[Rio de Janeiro]] were the first Olympics for a South American country. No bids from countries in Africa have succeeded.

The United States has hosted eight Olympic Games, four Summer and four Winter, more than any other nation. The British capital London holds the distinction of hosting three Olympic Games, all Summer, more than any other city. The other nations hosting the Summer Games twice are Germany, Australia, France and Greece. The other cities hosting the Summer Games twice are Los Angeles, Paris and Athens. With the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, Japan and Tokyo, respectively, will hold these statuses.

In addition to the United States, nations hosting multiple Winter Games are France with three, while Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Japan, Canada and Italy have hosted twice. Among host cities, [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[Innsbruck]] and [[St. Moritz]] have played host to the Winter Olympic Games more than once, each holding that honour twice. The most recent Winter Games were held in [[Pyeongchang]] in 2018, [[South Korea]]'s first Winter Olympics and second Olympics overall (including the 1988 Summer Olympics in [[Seoul]]).

The '''Philippine Bowling Federation''' (PBF) is a duly-accredited governing body of [[Bowling|Tenpin Bowling]] in the Philippines. PBF is currently recognized by the [[Philippine Olympic Committee]], [[Philippine Sports Commission]], Asian Bowling Federation, and World Bowling.&lt;ref name="PBF"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spin.ph/bowling/news/pbf-to-host-national-championship|title=PBF to host National Championships in effort to inspire new generation of Filipino bowlers|publisher=[[Sports Interactive Network Philippines]]|date=December 2, 2016|accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was formed in 2016, replacing the now-defunct [[Philippine Bowling Congress]] with different major stakeholders including former national athletes, bowling clubs, associations, proprietors and players as the incorporators.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Former national bowler and incumbent Senator [[Vicente Sotto III]] is the federation's Chairman, Philippine Senior Bowlers President Steve Robles is currently its president and Secretary General is Olivia "Bong" Coo.&lt;ref name="PBF"/&gt; [[Paeng Nepomuceno]], also a PBF Trustee led the coaching staff of the Philippine national bowling team.

The federation's first tournament was the 2016 PBF National Championships at the Coronado Lanes, [[Mandaluyong]] on December 3–4, 2016 which was attended by top PBF officials who are also doing the ceremonial serve before the start of the competition.&lt;ref name="PBF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://malaya.com.ph/business-news/sports/gahol-macatula-pace-pbf-national-kegfest|title=Gahol, Macatula pace PBF National kegfest|publisher=Malaya|date=December 6, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PBF hosted The Philippine International Open on May 13 to 28 2017 at the Coronado Lanes in Starmall Edsa Mandaluyong City.  The event is an Asian Bowling Federation ranking.  it was participated in by bowlers from host Philippines, Australia, Bahrain, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Guam U.S.A. and Filipino bowlers residing or working overseas.

In 2017, PBF has produced the first ever silver medals in the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games (AIMAG) in Ashgabat courtesy of Kenneth Chua in Men Singles and in Women Team of Five and after 39 years the Philippines regained the QubicaAmf Bowling World Cup Women's title with Krizziah Tabora in Hermosillo, Mexico.

PBF also hosted 19th Asian Youth Tenpin Bowling Championships in October 2017 at Corodano Lanes, Starmall EDSA in Mandaluyong City.  The tournament returned to the Philippines after 19 years.

PBF will host the 2018 Philippine International Open on April 28 - May 13.

The incorporators of PBF are Hon. Sen Vicente Sotto III, Stephen Hontiveros, Steve Robles, Alex Lim, Paeng Nepomuceno, Bong Coo, Biboy Rivera, Rene Reyas, Casiano King, Salome Lopa and Gina Avecilla.

'''Road bicycle racing''' is the [[cycle sport]] discipline of [[road cycling]], held on [[Road surface|paved roads]]. Road racing is the most popular [[professional sport|professional]] form of bicycle racing, in terms of numbers of competitors, events and spectators. The two most common competition formats are [[mass start]] events, where riders start simultaneously (though sometimes with a [[Handicapping|handicap]]) and race to set finish point; and [[time trial]]s, where [[individual time trial|individual riders]] or [[team time trial|team]]s race a course alone against the clock. [[Stage race]]s or "tours" take multiple days, and consist of several mass-start or time-trial stages ridden consecutively.

Professional racing has been most popular in Western Europe, centered historically on France, Spain, Italy and the [[Low Countries]]. Since the mid-1980s the sport has diversified with professional races now held on all continents of the globe. Semi-professional and amateur races are also held in many countries. The sport is governed by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI). As well as the UCI's annual [[UCI Road World Championships|World Championships]] for men and women, the biggest event is the [[Tour de France]], a three-week race that can attract over 500,000 roadside supporters a day.

==History==
Road racing in its modern form originated in the late 19th century. It began as an organized sport in 1868.&lt;ref name=McGurn&gt;''On Your Bicycle'', James McGurn, John Murray 1987{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sport was popular in the western European countries of France, Spain, Belgium, and Italy, and some of those earliest road bicycle races remain among the sport's biggest events. These early races include [[Liège–Bastogne–Liège]] (established 1892), [[Paris–Roubaix]] (1896), the [[Tour de France]] (1903), the [[Milan–San Remo]] and [[Giro di Lombardia]] (1905), the [[Giro d'Italia]] (1909), the [[Volta a Catalunya]] (1911), and the [[Tour of Flanders]] (1913). They provided a template for other races around the world.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Cycling has been [[Cycling at the Summer Olympics|part]] of the [[Summer Olympic Games]] since the modern sequence started in [[1896 Summer Olympics|Athens in 1896]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.olympic.org/cycling-road&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the most competitive and devoted countries since the beginning of 20th century were Belgium, France and Italy, then road cycling spread in [[Colombia]], Denmark,  Germany, [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], Spain and Switzerland after [[World War II]]. However nowadays as the sport grows in popularity through globalization, countries such as [[Kazakhstan]], Australia, Russia, [[Slovakia]], [[Cape Argus Cycle Race|South Africa]], New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom, Ireland, [[Poland]] and the United States continue to produce world-class cyclists.

==Road race types==

===Single-day bicycle race===
Single-day race distances may be as long as {{convert|180|mi|km}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Courses may run from place to place or comprise one or more laps of a circuit; some courses combine both, i.e., taking the riders from a starting place and then finishing with several laps of a circuit (usually to ensure a good spectacle for spectators at the finish). Races over short circuits, often in town or city centres, are known as [[criterium]]s. Some races, known as handicaps, are designed to match riders of different abilities and/or ages; groups of slower riders start first, with the fastest riders starting last and so having to race harder and faster to catch other competitors.

===Time trial===
Individual time trial (ITT) is an event in which cyclists race alone against the clock on flat or rolling terrain, or up a mountain road. A team time trial (TTT), including two-man team time trial, is a road-based bicycle race in which teams of cyclists race against the clock. In both team and individual time trials, the cyclists start the race at different times so that each start is fair and equal. Unlike individual time trials where competitors are not permitted to 'draft' (ride in the slipstream) behind each other, in team time trials, riders in each team employ this as their main tactic, each member taking a turn at the front while teammates 'sit in' behind. Race distances vary from a few km (typically a prologue, an individual time trial of usually less than {{convert|5|mi|km}} before a stage race, used to determine which rider wears the leader's jersey on the first stage) to between approximately {{convert|20|mi|km}} and {{convert|60|mi|km}}.

===Stage races===
Stage races consist of several races, or [[race stage|stages]], ridden consecutively. The competitor with the lowest cumulative time to complete all stages is declared the overall, or [[general classification]] (GC), winner. Stage races may also have other classifications and awards, such as individual stage winners, the [[points classification]] winner, and the "[[King of the Mountains]]" (or mountains classification) winner. A stage race can also be a series of road races and [[individual time trial]]s (some events include [[team time trial]]s). The stage winner is the first person to cross the finish line that day or the time trial rider (or team) with the lowest time on the course. The overall winner of a stage race is the rider who takes the lowest aggregate time to complete all stages (accordingly, a rider does not have to win all or any of the individual stages to win overall). Three-week stage races are called Grand Tours. The professional road bicycle racing calendar includes three Grand Tours - the Giro d'Italia, the Tour de France, and the Vuelta a Espana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadcycling.com/2011---A-Year-In-Review|title=2011 - A Year In Review|work=roadcycling.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultramarathon===

[[Ultra-distance cycling]] races are very long single stage events where the [[race clock]] continuously runs from start to finish. They usually last several days and the riders take breaks on their own schedules, with the winner being the first one to cross the finish line. Among the best-known ultramarathons is the [[Race Across America]] (RAAM), a coast-to-coast non-stop, single-stage race in which riders cover approximately {{convert|3000|mi|km}} in about a week. The race is sanctioned by the [https://www.ultracycling.com/ UltraMarathon Cycling Association] (UMCA). RAAM and similar events allow (and often require) racers to be supported by a team of staff; there are also ultra-distance bicycle races that prohibit all external support, such as the [[Transcontinental Race]] and the [[Indian Pacific Wheel Race]].

==Tactics==
[[Image:Military cyclists in pace line.jpg|thumb|right|Cyclists [[Drafting (racing)|drafting]] behind one another, forming a paceline]]

A number of tactics are employed to reach the objective of a race. This objective is being the first to cross the finish line in the case of a single-stage race, and clocking the least aggregate finish time in the case of a multi-stage race.

===Drafting===

Tactics are based on the aerodynamic benefit of [[Drafting (racing)|drafting]], whereby a rider can significantly reduce the required pedal effort by closely following in the [[slipstream]] of the rider in front. Riding in the main field, or [[peloton]], can save as much as 40% of the energy employed in forward motion when compared to riding alone.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, ''High-Tech Cycling'', 2003{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some teams designate a leader, whom the rest of the team is charged with keeping out of the wind and in good position until a critical section of the race. This can be used as a strength or a weakness by competitors; riders can cooperate and draft each other to ride at high speed (a '''paceline''' or '''echelon'''), or one rider can '''sit''' on a competitor's wheel, forcing him to do a greater share of the work in maintaining the pace and to potentially tire earlier. Drafting is not permitted in individual time trials.

===Breaks===

A group of riders that "breaks away" (a "break") from the peloton has more space and freedom, and can therefore be at an advantage in certain situations. Working together smoothly and efficiently, a small group can potentially maintain a higher speed than the peloton, in which the remaining riders may not be as motivated or organized to chase effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abbiss |first1=Chris R. |last2=Menaspà |first2=Paolo |last3=Villerius |first3=Vincent |last4=Martin |first4=David T. |title=Distribution of Power Output When Establishing a Breakaway in Cycling |journal=International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=452–5 |year=2013 |pmid=23539668 |url=http://journals.humankinetics.com/ijspp-back-issues/ijspp-volume-8-issue-4-july/distribution-of-power-output-when-establishing-a-breakaway-in-cycling }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually a rider or group of riders will try to break from the peloton by attacking and riding ahead to reduce the number of contenders for the win. If the break does not succeed and the body of cyclists comes back together, a [[Cycling sprinter|sprinter]] will often win by overpowering competitors in the final stretch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Menaspà |first1=P. |last2=Quod |first2=M. |last3=Martin |first3=D. |last4=Peiffer |first4=J. |last5=Abbiss |first5=C. |title=Physical Demands of Sprinting in Professional Road Cycling |journal=International Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=36 |issue=13 |pages=1058–62 |year=2015 |pmid=26252551 |doi=10.1055/s-0035-1554697 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/895556/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teamwork between riders, both pre-arranged and ad-hoc, is important in many aspects: in preventing or helping a successful break, and sometimes in delivering a sprinter to the front of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Menaspà |first1=Paolo |last2=Abbiss |first2=Chris R. |last3=Martin |first3=David T. |title=Performance Analysis of a World-Class Sprinter During Cycling Grand Tours |journal=International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=336–40 |year=2013 |pmid=23038704 |url=http://journals.humankinetics.com/ijspp-back-issues/ijspp-volume-8-issue-3-may/performance-analysis-of-a-world-class-sprinter-during-cycling-grand-tours }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrain and conditions===

To make the course more selective, races often feature difficult sections such as tough climbs, fast descents, and sometimes technical surfaces (such as the cobbled ''pavé'' used in the [[Paris–Roubaix]] race). Stronger riders are able to drop weaker riders during such sections, reducing the number of direct competitors able to take the win. Also weather may be a discriminating factor.

====Climbs====

Climbs are excellent places for a single rider to try and break away from a bunch, as the lower riding speeds in a climb seriously reduce the drafting advantage of the bunch. The escaping rider can then further capitalize on his position in the descent, as going downhill singly allows for more maneuvering space and therefore higher speeds than when in a bunch. In addition, because the bunch riders are keeping more space between them for safety reasons, their drafting benefits are again reduced. If this action takes place relatively close to the target (e.g. another bunch ahead, or the finish), the ride over flatter terrain after the descent is not long enough to let the drafting effect (which is then working at full power again) make the bunch catch up, making a climb escape even more attractive.

====Crosswinds====

Wind conditions can also make otherwise routine sections of a course potentially selective.  Cyclists have been finding that three- or four-spoked composite front wheels are more stable when confronting crosswinds.&lt;ref&gt;''High-tech Cycling'' by Ed Burke, publisher Human Kinetics, 2003 (pg. 27).&lt;/ref&gt; Crosswinds, particularly, alter the position of the "shadow" when drafting a rider, usually placing it diagonally behind the lead rider.&lt;ref&gt;

Following riders are unable to fully shelter from the wind. If such tactics are maintained for long enough, a weaker rider somewhere in the line will be unable to keep contact with the rider directly ahead, causing the peloton to split up.&lt;ref&gt;

 | isbn = 9781782550334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speed===

As well as exceptional fitness, successful riders must develop excellent bike handling skills in order to ride at high speeds in close quarters with other riders. Individual riders can reach speeds of {{convert|110|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while descending winding mountain roads and may reach 60–80&amp;nbsp;km/h (37–50&amp;nbsp;mph) level speeds during the final sprint to the finish line. Across a long stage race, such as a Grand Tour, the winner's average speed is usually near 40 km/h.

===Gruppetto===

In more organized races, a SAG wagon ("support and gear") or [[broom wagon]] follows the race to pick up stragglers. In professional stage racing, particularly the Tour de France, riders who are not in a position to win the race or assist a teammate, will usually attempt to ride to the finish within a specified percentage of the winner's finishing time, to be permitted to start the next day's stage. Often, riders in this situation band together to minimize the effort required to finish within the time limit; this group of riders is known as the ''gruppetto'' or ''[[Autobus (cycling)|autobus]]''. In one-day racing, professionals who no longer have any chance to affect the race outcome will routinely withdraw, even if they are uninjured and capable of riding to the finish.

==Teams==
While the principle remains that the winner is the first to cross the line, many riders are grouped together in teams, usually with commercial sponsors. On professional and semi-professional teams, team names are typically synonymous with the primary sponsors. As an example, some prominent professional teams of the last 30 years have been {{ct|TMO|1996}}, {{ct|RAB}}, {{ct|ONC}}, {{ct|MAP}} and {{ct|LAM|2003}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingranking.com/Rankings/TeamsOverall.aspx?fyear=1869&amp;lyear=2010|title=www.CyclingRanking.com :: Team Ranking 1869 - 2010|work=cyclingranking.com|accessdate=23 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723135631/http://www.cyclingranking.com/Rankings/TeamsOverall.aspx?fyear=1869&amp;lyear=2010|archivedate=23 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the team varies, from three in an amateur event for club riders to a dozen in professional races. Team riders decide between themselves, before and during the race, who has the best chance of winning. The choice will depend on hills, the chances that the whole field will finish together in a sprint, and other factors. The other riders on the team, or [[domestique]]s, will devote themselves to promoting the leader's chances, taking turns in the wind for him, refusing to chase with the peloton when he or she escapes, and so on.  The goal is to allow the leader to have enough energy to take off at the critical point of the race and go on to victory.

In professional races, team coordination is often performed by radio communication between the riders and the team director, who travels in a team car behind the race and monitors the overall situation. The influence of radios on race tactics is a topic of discussion amongst the cycling community, with some arguing that the introduction of radios in the 1990s has devalued the tactical knowledge of individual riders and has led to less exciting racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio killed the tactical star|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/blogarticle/109155/Radio-killed-the-tactical-star/blog/Matthew-Keenan|publisher=Cycling Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI), the governing body of pro cycling, voted to phase in a ban on the use of team radios in men's elite road racing.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hood, [http://velonews.competitor.com/2009/09/news/directors-uci-out-of-tune-on-race-radio-ban_98669 "Directors: UCI out of tune on race-radio ban"], Velonews.com (September 27, 2009). Retrieved 3.06.2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, after protests from teams, the ban introduced in 2011 excluded races on the top-level men's and women's circuits (the [[UCI World Tour]] and [[UCI Women's Road World Cup]]) and in 2015 the UCI reversed its stance, allowing race radios to be used in [[UCI race classifications|class HC and class 1 events]] from the 2016 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/uci-makes-u-turn-on-team-race-radio-ban-192842 |title=UCI makes U-turn on team race radio ban |last1=Brown |first1=Gregor |date=25 September 2015 |website=[[Cycling Weekly]]|access-date=23 April 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of riders==

Within the discipline of road racing, from young age different cyclists have different (relative) strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20807389 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01168.x | volume=22 | issue=3 | title=Physiological and anthropometric characteristics of junior cyclists of different specialties and performance levels | year=2012 | journal=Scand J Med Sci Sports | pages=392–8 | last1 = Menaspà | first1 = P | last2 = Rampinini | first2 = E | last3 = Bosio | first3 = A | last4 = Carlomagno | first4 = D | last5 = Riggio | first5 = M | last6 = Sassi | first6 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on these, riders tend to prefer different events over particular courses, and perform different tactical roles within a team.

The main specialities in road bicycle racing are:
* [[climbing specialist|Climber]]
* [[Puncheur]]
* [[Time trialist]]
* [[Cycling sprinter|Sprinter]]
* [[Cycling domestique|Domestique]]
* [[Bicycling terminology#all-rounder|All-rounder]]

==Stage-race ranking==

In a stage race a ''stage ranking'' is drawn up at the end of each stage, showing for each participating rider the completion time of the stage. The one with the lowest completion time wins the stage. At the same time a ''general ranking'' shows the cumulative finishing times of all prior stages for each participating rider. A rider who does not complete any of the stages within its respective time limit is disqualified. The one with the lowest total cumulative time is the general leader. The general leader typically wears a distinctive jersey (yellow in the [[Tour de France]]) and generally maintains a position near the head of the main mass of riders (the peloton), surrounded by team members, whose job it is to protect the leader.

Contenders for the general lead may stage "attacks" to distance themselves from the leader in "breakaways". The general leader's vulnerability to breakaways is higher when the escaping rider(s) trail by a small time difference in the general ranking, and as number of remaining stages diminishes. Riders, who finish in the stage ranking behind the general leader, increase their cumulative time disadvantage. Whereas those who finish ahead of the general leader decrease their time disadvantage and may even gain sufficient time to unseat the general leader. After each stage, the racer with the lowest cumulative time becomes (or remains) the general leader.

The general leader does not generally react to breakaways by riders who trail substantially in cumulative time. Such escapes usually achieve other goals, such as winning the stage, collecting sprinting or mountain points, or just creating air time for their team sponsors as a dedicated camera bike typically accompanies the escape.

==Notable bicycle races==
[[File:1991 Giro d'Italia Stage 13 Savigliano-Sestriere.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|GT: [[1991 Giro d'Italia]].]]

===Grand Tours===
Notable cycling races include the [[Tour de France]], a three-week stage race principally through France and ending in [[Paris]], the [[Giro d'Italia]] in Italy and the [[Vuelta a España]] in Spain. Each of these races is considered a "[[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tour]]".

===UCI World Tour===
Professional racing is governed by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]]. In 2005 it instituted the [[UCI ProTour]] (renamed [[UCI World Tour]] in 2011) to replace the [[UCI Road World Cup]] series. While the World Cup contained only one-day races, the World Tour includes the Grand Tours and other large stage races such as [[Tour Down Under]], [[Tour de Suisse]], [[Paris–Nice]] and the [[Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré|Critérium de Dauphiné Libéré]].

The former [[UCI Road World Cup]] one-day races – which include all five [[Classic cycle races]] or "Monuments" – were also part of the ProTour: [[Milan–San Remo]] (Italy), [[Tour of Flanders]] (Belgium), [[Paris–Roubaix]] (France), [[Liège–Bastogne–Liège]] (Belgium) and [[Amstel Gold Race]] ([[Netherlands]]) in the spring, and [[Clásica de San Sebastián]] (Spain), [[HEW Cyclassics]] (Germany), [[Züri-Metzgete]] (Switzerland, until 2006), [[Paris–Tours]] (France, until 2007) and [[Giro di Lombardia]] (Italy) in the autumn season.
[[File:Alexander Vinokourov 2, London 2012 Time Trial - Aug 2012.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|[[Cycling at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's road time trial|2012 London Olympics Time Trial]]]]

===Olympic Games===
[[Cycling at the Summer Olympics|Cycling]] has been a discipline in the [[summer Olympics]] ever since the birth of the modern Olympic movement. The historian Wlodzimierz Golebiewski says: "Cycling has become a major event on the Olympic programme ... Like many other sports it has undergone several changes over the years. Just as there used to be [[track and field]] events such as the standing [[high jump]] or [[Javelin throw|throwing the javelin]] with both hands, cyclists, too, used to compete for medals in events which today have been forgotten; for example in [[Athens]] in 1896, they attempted a 12-hour race, and in [[London]], in 1908, one of the events was a [[Sprint (cycling)|sprint]] for {{convert|603.49|m|yd|abbr=off}}."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"The Olympic Games", ed: Killanin, Rodda, Collier Books, New York{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympic Games has never been as important in road cycling as in other sports. Until the distinction ended, the best riders were professionals rather than amateurs and so did not take part.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Law enforcement always escort the athletes to ensure they and bystanders are kept safe during the cycling events, especially the road races.

===Paris–Rouen===
The success of the races in the Parc de St-Cloud inspired the Compagnie Parisienne and the magazine ''Le Vélocipède Illustré'' to run a race from the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris to the cathedral in [[Rouen]] on 7 November 1869. It was the world's first long-distance road race and also won by Moore, who took 10 hours and 25 minutes to cover 134&amp;nbsp;km. The runners-up were the Count André Castéra, who had come second to Moore at St-Cloud, and Jean Bobillier, riding a farm bike that weighed 35&amp;nbsp;kg. The only woman to finish within 24 hours was the self-styled [[Miss America]], in reality an unknown English woman who, like several in the field, had preferred not to compete under her real name.

===International development===
The growth of organised cycle racing led to the development of national administrative bodies, in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in 1878, France 1881, the [[Netherlands]] 1883, Germany 1884 and Sweden 1900. Sometimes, as in Britain, cycling was originally administered as part of [[Athletics (track and field)|athletics]], since cyclists often used the tracks used by [[running|runners]]. This, according to historian James McGurn, led to disputes within countries and internationally.

{{quote|The Bicycle Union [of Britain], having quarrelled with the [[Amateur Athletic Association]] over cycle race jurisdiction on AAA premises, took issue with the Union Vélocipèdique de France over the French body's willingness to allows its "[[amateurs]]" to compete for prizes of up to 2,000 francs, the equivalent of about sixteen months' pay for a French manual worker.&lt;ref name=McGurn/&gt;}}

The first international body was the [[International Cycling Association]] (ICA), established by an English schoolteacher named [[Henry Sturmey (1857–1930)|Henry Sturmey]], the founder of [[Sturmey-Archer]]. It opened in 1893 and held its first world championship in [[Chicago]], United States, the same year. A new organisation, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI), was set up on 15 April 1900 during the [[Olympic Games]] in [[Paris]]. Britain was not initially a member, but joined in 1903. The UCI, based in Switzerland, has run the sport ever since.

==Season==

In its home in Europe and in the United States, cycle racing on the road is a summer sport, although the season can start in early spring and end in autumn. The months of the season depend on the hemisphere. A racing year is divided between lesser races, single-day [[Classic cycle races|classics]] and stage races. The classics include the [[Tour of Flanders]], [[Paris–Roubaix]] and [[Milan–San Remo]]. The other important one-day race is the World Championships. Unlike other classics, the World Championships is held on a different course each year and ridden by national rather than sponsored teams. The winner wears a white jersey with coloured bands (often called "rainbow bands") around the chest.

In Australia, due to the relatively mild winters and hot summers, the amateur road racing season runs from autumn to spring, through the winter months, while [[criterium]] races are held in the mornings or late afternoons during the summer. Some professional events, including the [[Tour Down Under]], are held in the southern summer, mainly to avoid clashing with the major northern hemisphere races and allowing top professionals to compete.

It is one of the venues for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. It also hosts [[FC Rostov]] of the [[Russian Premier League]], replacing [[Olimp – 2]]. It has a capacity of 45,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/picturegalleries/8187285/Russia-2018-Fifa-World-Cup-artists-impressions-of-stadiums.html?image=13 Russia 2018 FIFA WORLD CUP artists Impressions of Stadiums]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Rostov Arena (2).jpg|thumb|left|Rostov Arena]]

In June 2013, during the groundbreaking for the stadium, five shells from WWII were found, almost perfectly preserved.

In August 2013, work began on the sandy alluvium foundation for the stadium. Work on the foundation was completed in May 2014. Construction commenced on the stadium substructure in October 2015. 
In December the construction site began to bring in heavy equipment and construction materials. In January 2015, crews began driving piles.

In March 2015, the stadium project was revised, reducing the cost of construction to 3 billion rubles. In the summer of 2015 pile driving was completed and superstructure construction began. 

In December 2015, work began on the installation of the metal roof frame. In July 2016 work on the concrete stadium bowl began. In addition, builders started construction of the facade and began landscaping the adjacent territory to the stadium. In November 2016 the reinforced concrete work of the stadium main bowl was fully completed and the installation of load bearing roof structures began.

== Description ==
The stadium has locker rooms for players and referees, staff rooms, rooms for match delegates, doping control areas, press centers, and other premises for high-profile sports tournaments.

The stadium grounds offer a sufficient number of parking spaces. The arena is designed to be accesible for people with limited mobility.

==Design==
[[File:2018 FIFA World Cup Group D march Iceland - Croatia 15.jpg|thumb|480px|Rostov Arena]]

In 2011, the final design for the new stadium was presented by [[Populous (company)|Populous]]. The irregular shape of both the roof and stands are distinctive features. Part of the seating is to be temporary, for the 2018 World Cup. After the tournament capacity may be decreased to 42,000. As the main architect for Rostov Region confirmed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://stadiumdb.com/news/2012/10/russia_rostov_to_create_a_new_heart_for_2018 Russia to create a new heart for 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; this stadium is to be the start of a new [[city centre]]. It will be the first large project built on the southern bank of the [[Don (Russia)|Don River]], with the rest of the city lying north. With shopping and dining destinations, the stadium will serve as a focal point for investments and new developments.

The '''Scottish Grand National''' is a Grade 3 [[National Hunt racing|National Hunt]] [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]] in Great Britain which is open to [[Horse racing|horses]] aged five years or older. It is run at [[Ayr Racecourse|Ayr]], [[Scotland]], over a distance of about 4 miles &lt;small&gt;(3 miles 7 furlongs and 176 yards,  or 6,397 metres)&lt;/small&gt; and during its running there are 27 fences to be jummped. It is a [[Handicap (horse racing)|handicap race]], and takes place each year in April.
It is Scotland's equivalent of the [[Grand National]], and is held during Ayr's two-day Scottish Grand National Festival meeting.

==History==
The race, then known as the "West of Scotland Grand National", was first run at a course near [[Houston, Renfrewshire]] in 1858.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ayr-racecourse.co.uk/news/2011-archive/april-2011/coral-sgn-facts |title=Scottish Grand National Facts |date=16 April 2011 |publisher=Ayr Racecourse |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of 32 jumps, mainly stone walls.&lt;ref name=facts /&gt;

In 1867, after objections by the leader of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Kirk]] in Houston,&lt;ref name=facts /&gt; the race moved to [[Bogside Racecourse]], near [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]]. The inaugural winner at Bogside, The Elk, was owned by the [[William Douglas-Hamilton, 12th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]]. During the early part of its history the race's distance was about three miles. It was later extended to 3⅞ miles, and became known by its present title in 1880, when it was won by Peacock.&lt;ref name=facts /&gt;

Bogside Racecourse closed in 1965, and the Scottish Grand National was transferred to Ayr the following year. At this point the race was increased to its present length. Several winners of the Scottish Grand National have also won its English counterpart at [[Aintree Racecourse|Aintree]]. The first to complete the double was Music Hall, the winner of the 1922 [[Grand National]]. The feat has been achieved more recently by [[Little Polveir]] and [[Earth Summit (horse)|Earth Summit]], but the only horse to win both races in the same year was [[Red Rum]] in 1974.

==Prize money==
The winning horse in 1867 won £100, increasing to £440 by 1906, £1030 in 1950, £5,436 in 1963 and  £119,595 in 2015.&lt;ref name=facts /&gt;

==Television coverage==
The first television coverage of the Scottish National was in 1953 on the [[BBC]].  It was also shown the following year, but then wasn't screened again until 1969 on [[ITV Network|ITV]] and has been shown live ever since.  Coverage moved to Channel 4 in 1986 and back to ITV in 2017.&lt;ref name=facts /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5640">[[File:Tote Board, Hollywood Park, Century, Inglewood, CA, US.jpg|thumb|Tote Board at Hollywood Park, California]]
A '''tote board''' (or '''totalisator'''/'''totalizator''') is a large numeric or alphanumeric display used to convey information, typically at a [[race track]] (to display the odds or payoffs for each horse) or at a [[telethon]] (to display the total amount donated to the charitable organization sponsoring the event).

The term "tote board" comes from the colloquialism for "totalizator" (or "totalisator"), the name for the automated system which runs [[parimutuel betting]], calculating payoff odds, displaying them, and producing tickets based on incoming bets. Parimutuel systems had used totalisator boards since the 1860s and they were often housed in substantial buildings.  However the manual systems often resulted in substantial delays in calculations of clients' payouts.

The first all-mechanical totalisator was invented by [[George Julius]]. Julius was a consulting engineer, based in Sydney. There is some irony that his father, the Anglican Bishop of Christchurch (New Zealand) had campaigned, in the early years of the twentieth century, against the iniquities of gambling using totalisators and its damage upon New Zealand society. That attitude had changed by late 1907 when he argued that the totalisator removed much of the evil of gambling with bookmakers. Bishop Julius was himself a noted amateur mechanic with a reputation for fixing clocks and organs in parishes he visited.

Initially, Julius was attempting to develop a voting calculating machine for the Australian government, to automatically reduce the instances of voter fraud and create a cheat-free political environment. He went on to present his unique invention, only to have his design rejected as it was deemed to be excessive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://australianbettingsites.net.au/history-of-sports-betting-in-australia/|title=The History of Australian Sports Betting|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first all-mechanical machine was installed at [[Ellerslie Racecourse]] in New Zealand in 1913 (first used on the Holy Saturday races on 22 March 1913), and the second was installed at [[Gloucester Park Racetrack]] in [[Western Australia]] in 1917. [[George Julius]] founded Automatic Totalisators Limited (ATL) in 1917, which supplied the "Premier Totalisator: now including electrical components".&lt;ref name="AE"&gt;Chisholm, Alec H. (ed.), The Australian Encyclopaedia, Vol. 4, p. 538, "Horse Racing", Halstead Press, Sydney, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The first totalisators installed in the United States were at [[Hialeah Park]], [[Florida]], in 1932 (by ATL), and at [[Arlington Park]] racecourse, [[Chicago]], in 1933. The first entirely electronic totalisator was developed in 1966.

Totalisators have been superseded by general purpose [[computer]]s running specialised [[gambling|wagering]] [[software]] such as [[Autotote]]. In many cases beyond older systems, telethon tote boards have either been replaced by [[LCD]] displays showing totals, or [[scoreboard]]s adapted to display dollar amounts.

==Automatic totalisators==
[[File:StateLibQld 1 104476 Inside the Totaliser at Ascot racetrack, February 1939.jpg|thumb|Behind the betting windows at Ascot racetrack, Australia February 1939]] 
An automatic totalisator is a device to add up the bets in a [[pari-mutuel]] betting system.  The whole of the pot (the stakes on all competitors) is divided ''[[pro rata]]'' to the stakes placed on the winning competitor and those tickets are paid out. Essentially it implements a system of [[starting price]] (SP) betting.

In particular it refers to the invention of [[George Julius]], the English-born, New Zealand educated, Australian inventor, engineer and businessman, though there have been other claimants, notably engineer Joseph G. Nash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article129112675 |title=Invention of Totalisator |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]] |location=Adelaide |date=30 April 1929 |accessdate=22 September 2015 |page=8 Edition: Home |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term automatic refers to the fact that the bets were automatically summed and a ticket issued when a bet was registered on the issuing machines, and it provided a safe and virtually fraud-free method of betting, replacing the earlier [[jam-pot totes]], which used either paper transactions or some method of counting bets like steel ball bearings. The machine did not actually calculate the payout.

The method was widely used in the Australian, New Zealand and American [[horse-racing]] industries and for [[greyhound racing]] in the UK, although there were other installations in countries as diverse as France, Venezuela and Singapore.
