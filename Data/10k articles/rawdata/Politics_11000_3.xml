[[File:Palace.of.westminster.arp.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Palace of Westminster]]]]
The '''2009 cash for influence scandal''' (also '''cash for amendments''' or '''cash for laws''') was a [[political scandal]] in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2009 concerning four [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Life Peers]] offering to help make amendments to legislation for up to £120,000. The Lords Privileges Committee recommended the two men be suspended from the [[House of Lords|House]] for up to six months after an investigation into allegations made against four Labour peers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8049412.stm " Two Labour peers face suspension", BBC NEWS, Thursday, 14 May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Taylor, Baron Taylor of Blackburn|Lord Taylor of Blackburn]] was suspended as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] member pending the investigation while [[Lord Truscott]] quit the party. On 20 May, the House of Lords considered the report of the Privileges Committee and voted to suspend Lord Taylor and Lord Truscott for six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8060003.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lords vote to suspend two peers | date=21 May 2009 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suspensions were the first since [[Oliver Cromwell]]’s era in the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;"Parliament's darkest day: MPs suspended and Michael Martin at risk", The Times, 15 May 2009 [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6290054.ece]&lt;/ref&gt; The previous member to be suspended from the House of Lords is believed to have been [[Thomas Savile, 1st Earl of Sussex|Thomas Savile]], who was barred in 1642 for siding with [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5gB8-2UOU3EeeGWn8lkQcBhEKPk9g Two peers facing Lords suspension], The Press Association (via Google News), 20 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations==

The allegations were made by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' Insight team in an article published on Sunday, 25 January 2009.  In a series of covert interviews, the four peers stated that they could use their political influence to amend legislation. The individuals concerned were [[Lord Snape]], [[Lord Moonie]], Lord Taylor of Blackburn and [[Lord Truscott]]. Six other peers either declined to help or did not respond to the undercover reporters' approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5581547.ece | title = Revealed: Labour lords change laws for cash | publisher = [[The Sunday Times]] | date = 25 January 2009  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper claimed its reporters approached the four peers masquerading as lobbyists acting for an unnamed company. The firm, they said, wanted to set up a chain of shops in the UK and were seeking exemption from current laws on business rates.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5581570.ece | title = Whispered over tea and cake: price for a peer to fix the law | publisher = [[The Sunday Times]] | date = 25 January 2009  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7849812.stm | title = Q&amp;A: Peers cash claims  
 | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 27 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recording was later released of Lord Taylor saying firms paid him up to £100,000 a year. Lord Taylor tells an undercover reporter: "Some companies that I work with would pay me £100,000 a year." When the reporter questions it, he adds: "That's cheap for what I do for them. And other companies would pay me £25,000."

On 30 January, The Sunday Times released further material via their website containing audio and video purporting to show Lord Truscott describing how the passage of legislation in both the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and [[House of Lords]] could be influenced and what part he could play in successfully facilitating amendments on behalf of paying clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5618786.ece | title = Exclusive: Peers for cash investigation - new undercover footage | publisher = [[The Sunday Times]] | date = 30 January 2009  | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Calvert | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the fundamental principles set out in the [[Code of Conduct]] for the House of Lords are that members "must never accept any financial inducement as an incentive or reward for exercising parliamentary influence" and "must not vote on any bill or motion, or ask any question in the House or a committee, or promote any matter, in return for payment or any other material benefit (the "no paid advocacy" rule)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcond/ldcond.htm | title = House of Lords - Code of Conduct | publisher = [[House of Lords]] | date = 31 March 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==

Following publication of The Sunday Times article, the Labour Party immediately promised an urgent investigation. The Leader in the House of Lords, [[Janet Royall, Baroness Royall of Blaisdon|Lady Royall]] said she had spoken to the four Labour peers concerned and would be "pursuing the matter with utmost vigour". She also said House of Lords members must "abide by its high standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7849594.stm | title = 'Concern' over peers cash claims | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 25 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement to the House of Lords on 26 January Lady Royall called the claims "deeply shocking". She pointed out that they were only allegations at this stage but said the claims had been "damaging not just to this House but to Parliament and politics". She said the matter had been referred to the Lords Interests sub committee (a sub committee of the [[Committee for Privileges]]), which had already met and investigations were underway. She said she believed "tougher sanctions" were needed to deal with peers who broke the rules and she had written to the chairman of the [[Committee on Standards and Privileges]] to ask him to review the matter.&lt;ref name="BBC peers respond"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7850428.stm | title = Peers respond to cash allegations | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 26 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January, two of the four peers made statements in The House of Lords. Lord Snape told The House "As one of the people involved in this incident may I first of all apologise for bringing this House, if I have done so, into disrepute. But may I say that these are allegations in a Sunday newspaper and may I appeal to noble lords in all parts of the House to allow me the opportunity to refute these allegations before your lordships house and elsewhere."&lt;ref name="BBC peers respond"/&gt;

Lord Taylor stated "If I have done anything that has brought this House into disrepute I most humbly apologise. I feel within my own conscience I followed the rules and the directions that have been given in this House over the 31 years I have been a member."&lt;ref name="BBC peers respond"/&gt;

Lord Truscott told the [[BBC]] he did admit to having had "discussions" with a reporter, but said that "to suggest I would offer to put down amendments for money is a lie."&lt;ref name="BBC peers respond"/&gt;

Lord Moonie acknowledged discussing a fee of £30,000 but said he had not done anything "outside the rules".&lt;ref name="BBC peers respond"/&gt;

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader in the Lords, [[Lord Strathclyde]], said the allegations represented a "shocking and depressing moment" for the House of Lords. "This House has been mired in a grim torrent of criticism about a culture of sleaze," he told peers. "If these allegations are true those involved have shamed this House," he said, adding there were no "grey areas in the paid advocacy rules".&lt;ref name="BBC peers respond"/&gt;

[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] said: "It's important that we don't pre-judge these investigations but these are serious allegations and we are determined to get to the bottom of these allegations, and whatever action needs to be taken will be taken."&lt;ref name="BBC peers respond"/&gt;

The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] wrote to [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police commissioner]] [[Paul Stephenson (police officer)|Sir Paul Stephenson]] asking for an investigation to take place.&lt;ref name="BBC peers respond"/&gt;

SNP MP [[Angus MacNeil]], whose complaint started the "[[cash for honours]]" called for the four peers to be suspended, while an investigation is carried out.&lt;ref name="BBC peers respond"/&gt;

==Findings of House of Lords Committees==
The House of Lords Sub-committee on Lords' Interests was asked to report on the matter.&lt;ref name="subcommittee"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldprivi/88/8805.htm] Lords Sub-Committee on Lords Interests Report&lt;/ref&gt; It found that Lord Moonie had not expressed a willingness to breach the code, but that Lord Snape, Lord Truscott and Lord Taylor had all done so. Truscott and Taylor were additionally found to have failed to act on their personal honour.

The Lords' Privileges Committee considered the sub-committee's report and heard further evidence from Lord Snape. It published its findings on 14 May 2009. It found that Lord Moonie and Lord Snape had not breached the code, but that Lord Truscott and Lord Taylor had done, and recommended that they be suspended.&lt;ref name="fullcommittee"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldprivi/88/8802.htm The Conduct of Lord Moonie, Lord Snape, Lord Truscott and Lord Taylor of Blackburn ] Lords Privileges Committee Report&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police investigations==

On 29 January 2009 it was confirmed that Police were looking at the allegations following the complaint by the Liberal Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7858297.stm | title = Police look at Peers cash claims | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 29 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 11 February 2009 the Metropolitan Police confirmed that no action would be taken, noting that "The application of the criminal law to members of the House of Lords in the circumstances that have arisen here is far from clear," and that "In addition, there are very clear difficulties in gathering and adducing evidence in these circumstances in the context of [[parliamentary privilege]]."

==Background==
{{main|Historical background of the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine}}
{{Further|Russians in Ukraine|Euromaidan|2014 Ukrainian revolution}}
Ukraine became gripped by unrest when [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] refused to sign [[Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement|an association agreement with the European Union]] on 21 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/world/europe/a-ukraine-city-spins-beyond-the-governments-reach.html?_r=0 | title=A Ukraine City Spins Beyond the Government's Reach | work=The New York Times | date= 15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organized political movement known as '[[Euromaidan]]' demanded closer ties with the [[European Union]], and the ousting of Yanukovych.&lt;ref name=Reuters121213&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/12/us-ukraine-idUSBRE9BA04420131212|title=Kiev protesters gather, EU dangles aid promise|agency=Reuters|date=12 December 2013|accessdate=10 April 2014|author=Richard Balmforth}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement was ultimately successful, culminating in the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|February 2014 revolution]], which removed Yanukovych and [[Second Azarov Government|his government]].&lt;ref name="RFEKT25114"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/protesters-police-tense-standoff-ukraine/25241945.html|title=Ukraine Opposition Vows To Continue Struggle After Yanukovych Offer|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=25 January 2014|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some people in largely [[Russophone]] [[Eastern Ukraine|eastern]] and [[southern Ukraine]], the traditional bases of support for Yanukovych and his [[Party of the Regions]], did not approve of the revolution, and began to protest in favour of closer ties with Russia. Various demonstrations were held in [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea|Crimea]] in favour of leaving Ukraine and accession to the [[Russian Federation]], leading to the [[2014 Crimean crisis]].

On 1 March, regional state administration (RSA) buildings in various [[Eastern Ukraine|eastern Ukrainian]] [[Oblasts of Ukraine|oblasts]] were briefly occupied by pro-Russian activists. By 11 March, all occupations had ended, after units of the local police and the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] (SBU) re-took the buildings.&lt;ref name="march6cbs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukrainian-city-of-donetsk-epitomizes-countrys-crisis/|title=Ukrainian city of Donetsk epitomizes country's crisis|publisher=CBS News|date=6 March 2014|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Donetsk]], protests escalated into violence on multiple occasions, including on 13 March, when a pro-Ukrainian protester was stabbed to death.&lt;ref name="reutersmarch13"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/13/us-ukraine-crisis-donetsk-idUSBREA2C20Z20140313|title=One dead in Ukraine clash in eastern city|agency=Reuters|date=13 March 2014|accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DEN5314"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.euronews.com/2014/03/05/ukraine-donetsk-government-building-recaptured/|title=Ukraine: Donetsk government building recaptured|work=Euronews|date=5 March 2014|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.euronews.com/2014/03/07/ukraine-police-on-alert-as-violence-erupts-at-pro-russia-demo/|title=Ukraine police on alert as violence erupts at pro-Russia demo|work=Euronews|date=7 March 2014|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kharkiv]], [[Patriot of Ukraine (organization)|Patriots of Ukraine]] militants killed an anti-Maidan protester and a passer-by on the night of 15 March, when anti-Maidan protesters attacked the [[Right Sector]] headquarters in the city.&lt;ref name=UkraineNationalists/&gt;

===Public opinion in Ukraine===
A poll conducted by [[Kyiv International Institute of Sociology]] (KIIS) from 8–18 February 2014 assessed support for union with Russia throughout Ukraine. It found that, overall, 12% of those polled favoured union with Russia.&lt;ref name="KIISpoll"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=236&amp;page=1 | title=HOW RELATIONS BETWEEN UKRAINE AND RUSSIA SHOULD LOOK LIKE? PUBLIC OPINION POLL RESULTS | work=Kyiv International Institute of Sociology | date=4 March 2014 | accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 68.0% of those from the four regions surveyed agreed that Ukraine should remain independent, with friendly relations maintained between Russia and Ukraine.

Support for a union between Russia and Ukraine was found to be much higher in certain areas:
* 41.0% [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea|Crimea]]
* 33.2% [[Donetsk Oblast]]
* 24.1% [[Luhansk Oblast]]
* 24.0% [[Odessa Oblast]]
* 16.7% [[Zaporizhia Oblast]]
* 15.1% [[Kharkiv Oblast]]
* 13.8% [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]

In an opinion poll conducted from 14–26 March by the [[International Republican Institute]], 26–27% of those polled in southern and eastern Ukraine viewed the [[Euromaidan]] protests as a coup d'état.&lt;ref name="iri" /&gt; Only 5% of respondents in eastern Ukraine felt that Russian-speakers were 'definitely' under pressure or threat. 43% of ethnic Russians ('definitely' or 'rather') supported the decision of the Russian Federation to send its military to protect Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine.

In the poll, 22% of those in southern Ukraine, and 26% of those in eastern Ukraine supported the idea of federalization for the country; 69% of southerners and 53% of easterners supported Ukraine remaining as a unitary state; and only 2% of southerners and 4% of easterners supported separatism.&lt;ref name="iri"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2014%20April%205%20IRI%20Public%20Opinion%20Survey%20of%20Ukraine,%20March%2014-26,%202014.pdf | title=IRI Public Opinion Survey of Ukraine (14–26 March 2014) | publisher=International Republican Institute | date=5 April 2014 | accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 59% of those polled in eastern Ukraine would like to join the [[Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia|Russian-led customs union]], while only 22% were in favour of joining the [[European Union]]. 37% of southerners would prefer to join this customs union, while 29% were in favour of joining the EU. 90% of those polled in western Ukraine wanted to enter an economic union with EU, while only 4% favoured the customs union led by Russia. Among all the Ukrainians polled overall, 34% favour joining the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], while 44% are against joining it. In eastern Ukraine and southern Ukraine, only 14% and 11% of the respondents respectively favour joining NATO, while 67% in eastern Ukraine and 52% in southern Ukraine oppose joining it. 72% of people polled in eastern Ukraine thought that the country was going in the wrong direction, compared with only 36% in western Ukraine.&lt;ref name="iri" /&gt;

A poll conducted by the Institute of Social Research and Policy Analysis analysed the identities of Donetsk inhabitants.&lt;ref name="onebuild"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/world/europe/ukraine-russia.html?_r=0 | title=In Eastern Ukraine, a One-Building, Pro-Russia Realm Persists Despite Criticism | work=The New York Times | date=9 April 2014 | accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While support for separatism was low, just over a third of polled Donetsk inhabitants identified themselves as "citizens of Ukraine". More preferred "Russian-speaking residents of Ukraine" or "residents of [[Donbass]]".&lt;ref name="onebuild" /&gt; The same poll determined that 66% of Donetsk residents that were polled supported remaining in a unified Ukraine, while 18.2% supported joining Russia, and 4.7% supported independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://novosti.dn.ua/details/222251/|script-title=ru:66% дончан видят будущее в единой Украине|trans-title=66% of Donetsk denizens see a future in a united Ukraine|language=ru|work=News of Donbass|date=9 April 2014|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second poll conducted from 26–29 March showed that 77% of residents condemned the takeover of administrative buildings, while 16% supported such actions. Furthermore, 40.8% of Donetsk citizens supported rallies for Ukraine's unity, while 26.5% supported pro-Russian rallies.&lt;ref name="support"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/total-of-77-citizens-in-donetsk-condemn-administrative-buildings-takeover-342872.html | title=Total of 77 percent of citizens in Donetsk condemn administrative buildings takeover | work=Kyiv Post | date=10 April 2014 | accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In another research poll conducted 8–16 April by KIIS, a vast majority disapproved of the seizure of administrative buildings by protesters. Over 50% of those polled in southern and eastern Ukraine considered acting President [[Oleksandr Turchynov]] to be illegitimate. Most of those polled in southern and eastern Ukraine believed that the disarmament and disbandment of illegal radical groups is crucial to preserving national unity. 19.1% of those polled in southern and eastern Ukraine believed that Ukraine should be an independent state, 45.2% were for an independent state but with decentralization of the power to the regions, but most felt Russia and Ukraine should share open borders without visa restrictions; 8.4% were in favour of Ukraine and Russia uniting into a single state. 15.4% said they favoured secession of their region to join the Russian Federation, and 24.8% favoured Ukraine becoming a federation. Most of those polled said they found nothing attractive about Russia, but those who did, did so for economic, and not cultural reasons. Those polled in southern and eastern Ukraine were generally split on the legitimacy of the present government and parliament, but a majority in all regions agreed that deposed president Viktor Yanukovych was not the legal president of the country. In all regions but the Donbass, pro-Euromaidan oligarch [[Petro Poroshenko]] dominated preliminary election polls.&lt;ref name="upkiis"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ukrainianpolicy.com/southeast-statistics-of-ukraine-april-2014/ | title=Southeast Statistics | work=Kyiv International Institute of Sociology; Ukrainian Policy | date=19 April 2014 | accessdate=20 April 2014 | last=Babiak | first=Mat | location=Kiev}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation remained tense on 23 April, with occupation of government buildings ongoing throughout the region. [[OSCE]] monitors observed that the city administration building, SBU building, and police station in Sloviansk remained heavily fortified by armed groups of men with masks and automatic weapons.&lt;ref name=OSCEmonitor24/&gt; The city remained quiet, with no protests occurring. However, the monitors believed that the city remained under heavy surveillance, both by people in uniforms and masks, but also by many persons in civilian clothing.

====Attacks on journalists====
There have been a number of attacks on members of the press by members of the separatists in Donetsk. On 10 April, protesters outside the Donetsk RSA attacked Belarusian journalists for speaking the [[Belarusian language]], and not Russian; Ukrainian journalists were forced to speak Russian to avoid angering pro-Russian protesters. According to ''[[Kyiv Post]]'', they also attacked reporters from [[Russia Today]], but RT did not carry the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/04/10/7022013/ |title=Донецькі сепаратисти нападають на білоруських та російських журналістів – ЗМІ &amp;#124; Українська правда |work=Ukrayinska Pravda |date=9 April 2014 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later on 12 April, a group of 150 people supported the armed militants outside the police station in Sloviansk were hostile to journalists, telling them to "go back to Kiev."&lt;ref name="kyivpost4"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rachkevych|first=Mark|title=Armed pro-Russian separatists launch coordinated attacks in Donetsk Oblast, seize buildings and set up checkpoints|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/armed-pro-russian-extremists-seize-police-stations-in-donetsks-slavyansk-shaktarysk-fail-to-take-donetsk-prosecutors-office-343195.html|newspaper=Kyiv Post|date=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In protest against the proposed cancelling of the [[Legislation on languages in Ukraine|regional language law]], the regional administration of [[Luhansk Oblast]] voted to demand that the Russian language be given official language status. They also demanded the stopping of the persecution of former Berkut officers, the disarming of Maidan self-defence units, and the banning of a number of far-right political organizations, like [[Svoboda (political party)|Svoboda]] and [[UNA-UNSO]]. In the event that the authorities failed to comply with the demands, the Oblast administration reserved the "right to ask for help from the brotherly people of the Russian Federation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazeta.ua/ru/articles/politics/_oblsovet-luganska-ugrozhaet-razoruzhit-majdan-rukami-bratskoj-rossii/545140 |title=Облсовет Луганская угрожает разоружить Майдан руками "братской" России |publisher=Gazeta.ua |accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1,500 participants were observed at the peak of the rally.&lt;ref name="OSCEmonitor22"/&gt; The leaders of the rally said that they were not separatists, and sought a peaceful solution, which would allow Luhansk to remain within Ukraine.&lt;ref name="OSCEmonitor22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iflhfr" /&gt;

The [[OSCE]] monitoring mission reported that the situation in Luhansk on 23 April was 'stable', and that the area around the occupied SBU building was 'quiet'.&lt;ref name="OSCEmonitor24"/&gt; The monitors met with representatives of a non-governmental organization that said they had been held captive for six hours within the building on 21 April, and that about 100 men in unmarked uniforms with machine guns were present inside it at the time.&lt;ref name="OSCEmonitor24"/&gt;

[[Vladimir Varshavsky]] was elected "people's governor".&lt;ref name="OSCEmonitor22"/&gt;

More peaceful rallies were held in the morning on 23 April, with both anti-government and pro-government demonstrations held in Kharkiv city centre.&lt;ref name="OSCEmonitor24"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/117995 | title=Latest from the Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine – based on information received up until 23 April 2014, 19:00 | work=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe | date=24 April 2014 | accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="itarkharkiv"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://en.itar-tass.com/world/729259 | title=Supporters of Ukraine's federalization picketed mayor's office in Kharkiv | work=Information Telegraph Agency of Russia | date=23 April 2014 | accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each rally was attended by around 400 people.&lt;ref name="OSCEmonitor24" /&gt; Around 150 anti-government protesters gathered outside the city council building on Constitution Square concurrently with the rallies.

The situation overall in Kharkiv remained calm, though police remained on high alert.&lt;ref name="OSCEmonitor24" /&gt; A small group of riot police were seen guarding the RSA building on 25 April, though the police presence as a whole in the city appeared to be much reduced.&lt;ref name="OSCEmonitor26"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/118044 | title=Latest from the Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine – based on information received up until 25 April 2014 | work=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe | date=26 April 2014 | accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shooting of Hennadiy Kernes====
The mayor of Kharkiv, [[Hennadiy Kernes]], was shot in the back while cycling on 28 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27183591 | title=Ukraine crisis: US and EU to intensify Russia sanctions | publisher=BBC News | date=28 April 2014 | accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to be in "grave, but stable" condition.&lt;ref name="mayorshot"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-crisis-kharkiv-mayor-hennady-kernes-shot-in-the-back-1.2623922 | title=Kharkiv Mayor Hennady Kernes shot in the back | publisher=CBC News | date=28 April 2014 | accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RTmayorshot"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://rt.com/news/155320-kharkov-mayor-shot-ukraine/ | title=Mayor of Kharkov, Ukraine shot in back, hospitalized | publisher=RT|location=Russia | date=28 April 2014 | accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kernes was known as a staunch opponent of the Euromaidan. However, he had also stated that he did not support the pro-Russian insurgency, and backed a united Ukraine.&lt;ref name="mayorshot" /&gt; [[Mykhailo Dobkin]], a former governor of Kharkiv Oblast and potential Ukrainian presidential candidate, said "You want to know my opinion, they were shooting not at Kernes, but at Kharkiv", and said that the shooting was an attempt to destabilize what was otherwise a relatively calm region.&lt;ref name="mayorshot" /&gt;

====Further protests====
[[File:Ukrainian military roadblocks in Donetsk oblast.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian military roadblocks in Donetsk oblast, 8 May]]
Kharkiv returned to relative calm by 30 April, no rallies having been observed there by OSCE monitors.&lt;ref name="OSCEmonitor30"/&gt; A minor demonstration by about four-hundred separatists was held in Freedom Square on 4 May.&lt;ref name=OSCEmonitor6/&gt; A notably increased police presence remained in and around Freedom Square. On the same day, a planned rally by pro-Ukrainian unity groups was cancelled due to concerns about potential clashes in the wake of the Odessa disaster.&lt;ref name=OSCEmonitor6/&gt;

Demonstrations by "opponents of Ukrainian unity" with Russian and Soviet flags were held in front of the Russian and Polish consulates in Kharkiv city on 26 May.&lt;ref name="OSCEmonitor527"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/119114 | title=Latest news from the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine based on information received until 26 May, 18:00 | publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe | date=27 May 2014 | accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These demonstrators initiated petitions that they said were signed by 1,500 people from Kharkiv, which called on the EU and Russia not to recognise the results of the 25 May [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2014|Ukrainian presidential election]]. They also voiced opposition to the Ukrainian government's military operations in Donetsk Oblast.&lt;ref name="OSCEmonitor527" /&gt; Mayor [[Hennadiy Kernes]] returned to Kharkiv city on 16 June, after receiving medical treatment in [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=OSCE617/&gt; The city administration provided buses for around 1,000 people who came to greet him upon his return.

Demonstrations similar to the one that took place on 26 May continued throughout the month of June. One such demonstration took place on 22 June, with 800–900 people gathering on the 73rd anniversary of the [[Operation Barbarossa|German Reich's invasion of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=OSCE622/&gt; The demonstrators voiced the same concerns about the Ukrainian government's military operations to combat separatist insurgents in Donetsk Oblast.&lt;ref name=OSCE622/&gt; Concurrently, around 1,000 people rallied for a ban on the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], and on pro-Russian demonstrations.&lt;ref name="OSCE624"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/120158 | title=Latest from the Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine based on information received until 23 June 2014 | publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe | date=24 June 2014 | accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the people participating in this rally approached the location of the aforementioned pro-Russian demonstration. A verbal confrontation ensued, involving participants of both rallies.&lt;ref name="OSCE624" /&gt; Police officers that had been escorting the pro-Ukrainian demonstrators dispersed the crowd.&lt;ref name="OSCE624" /&gt; Thirty activists from both groups were temporarily detained as a result.

* '''{{flagicon|Republic of Crimea}} [[Republic of Crimea (country)|Republic of Crimea]]''' – This was proclaimed on 17 March by the parliament of the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] and the city of [[Sevastopol]]. These two entities, which together comprise the whole of the geographic Crimea, functioned as separate administrative units within Ukraine. They united for the purpose of declaring independence as the "Republic of Crimea". After [[Crimean status referendum, 2014|a disputed referendum]] on the [[political status of Crimea]] held on 16 March 2014, the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian Federation annexed]] the Republic and split it back into the [[Federal cities of Russia|federal city]] of Sevastopol and the [[Republics of Russia|federal subject]] of the [[Republic of Crimea]].

On 29 March, Russian political scientist [[Aleksandr Dugin]] appeared in a leaked Skype video conference with Kateryna Gubareva, the wife of Donetsk-based separatist Pavel Gubarev. In the call, he reassured her of Moscow's support and further actions that should be taken by the movement. He also stated all presidential nominees should be considered 'traitors' with only Yanukovych considered legitimate. He also said that separatists should "act in a radical way" and Moscow will later support civil war in Ukraine, saying "The Kremlin is determined to fight for the independence of South-east Ukraine."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/02/alexander-dugin-the-crazy-ideologue-of-the-new-russian-empire.html Alexander Dugin: The Crazy Ideologue of the New Russian Empire], [[The Daily Beast]] (2 April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://maidantranslations.com/2014/04/02/known-russian-fascist-aleksandr-dugin-instructs-ukrainian-separatists/ Known Russian Fascist Aleksandr Dugin Instructs Ukrainian Separatists | Voices of Ukraine].

* In a meeting held on 7 July in Donetsk city, Russian politician [[Sergey Kurginyan]] held a press conference with representatives of [[Donbass People's Militia]], including [[Pavel Gubarev]], and said that Russia did provide significant military support for the separatists. During a discussion among the participants, Gubarev complained that the arms that had been sent was old, and not fully functional. In response, Kurginyan listed specific items, including 12,000 automatic rifles, grenade launchers, [[2S9 Nona]] self-propelled mortars, two [[BMP development|BMP]]s, and three tanks, that he knew had been supplied to the separatists by Russia.

{{main article|Pathway Centers for Children}}

As a 22-year-old speech pathologist and audiologist, Prasad learned that to pay for his professional services clients quite often would have to sell everything they had and would make great sacrifices. Impressed by this, he eventually started giving free services to whoever needed it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pathway.org.in/history.html Pathway's History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1582">The '''Academic Competitiveness Grant''', more commonly known by its acronym '''ACG''', was a [[federal assistance]] grant reserved for college students with the greatest need for [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] to attend school. To be eligible for this grant, students must have met all of the following criteria:

#They must be a [[United States citizen]] or eligible non-citizen;
#They must be [[Federal Pell Grant]] eligible;
#They must be enrolled at least half-time in a degree program;
#They must be in their first or second year of study at a two-year or four-year degree-granting institution;
#First-year students must not have been previously enrolled in an [[undergraduate]] program;
#Second-year students must have at least a cumulative 3.0 [[GPA]] on a 4.0 scale for their first year.

The ACG provided up to $750 for the first year and $1300 for the second year of study.

The ACG is no longer available as of the 2011-2012 financial aid award year due to government cuts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifap.ed.gov/eannouncements/021111CODSysImp1112AwardYr.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alternative Democratic Reform Party''' ({{lang-lb|Alternativ Demokratesch Reformpartei}}, {{lang-fr|Parti réformiste d'alternative démocratique}}, {{lang-de|Alternative Demokratische Reformpartei}}), abbreviated to '''ADR''', is a [[national conservatism|national-conservative]] [[List of political parties in Luxembourg|political party]] in [[Luxembourg]].&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt;  It has three seats in the sixty-seat [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]], making it the fifth-largest party.

The party was founded in 1987, as a [[single-issue party]] from demanding equality of [[state pension]] provision between [[civil servant]]s and all other citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hirsch |first=Mario |authorlink=Mario Hirsch |date=December 1995 |title=Luxembourg |journal=[[European Journal of Political Research]] |volume=28 |issue=3–4 |pages=415–420 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6765.1995.tb00507.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1989|1989 election]], it won four seats, and established itself as a political force.  It peaked at seven seats [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1999|in 1999]], due to mistrust of politicians failing to resolve the pensions gap,&lt;ref&gt;Dumont et al (2006), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; before falling back to four today.  Its significance on a national level makes it the most successful [[pensioners' party]] in western Europe.&lt;ref name="Pensioners' parties in Eastern" /&gt;

Political success has required the ADR to develop positions on all matters of public policy, developing an [[anti-establishment]],&lt;ref name="Pensioners' parties in Eastern"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hanley |first=Seán |year=2007 |month= |title=Pensioners' parties in Eastern and Western Europe: An Overview and Some Theoretical Propositions |url=http://www.inlogov.bham.ac.uk/seminars/minor_parties/pdfs/Hanley.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; conservative platform.  It has adopted [[economic liberalism]], filling a gap vacated by the [[Democratic Party (Luxembourg)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="Dumont 66"&gt;Dumont et al (2006), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the largest party in [[Luxembourg]] to take a euro-realist/softly eurosceptic line&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00344893.2016.1241821?needAccess=true&lt;/ref&gt;, and is a member of the anti-[[Federal Europe|federalist]] [[Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe]]. The ADR wishes to implement Swiss-style direct democracy. There has been debate whether the party should be classified as populist, although most experts agree that the ADR is better characterised as a national-conservative party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Niedermayer|first1=Oskar|last2=Stöss|first2=Richard|last3=Haas|first3=Melanie|title=Die Parteiensysteme Westeuropas|date=2006|publisher=VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=978-3531141114|page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=van Kessel|first1=Stijn Theodoor|title=Supply and demand: identifying populist parties in Europe and explaining their electoral performance.

==History==

===Emergence===
{{Politics of Luxembourg}}
The ADR has its roots in a demonstration in [[Luxembourg City]] on 28 March 1987, held to protest at the disparities between the 5/6ths [[final salary]] scheme enjoyed by civil servants and the basic state pension received by everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hirsch |first=Mario |authorlink=Mario Hirsch |date=December 1996 |title=Luxembourg |journal=[[European Journal of Political Research]] |volume=30 |issue=3–4 |pages=405–409 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6765.1996.tb00694.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large crowd, and the collection of 10,000 signatures for a petition demanding change, persuaded the organisers that there was widespread public support. The party was founded on the 12 May 1987 as the 'Action Committee 5/6ths Pensions for Everyone' (''Aktiounskomitee 5/6 Pensioun fir jiddfereen'').&lt;ref name="ADR Geschicht"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adr.lu/index.php?id=22 |title=Geschicht vun der Partei |accessdate=2006-08-23 |year=2006 |publisher=Alternative Democratic Reform Party |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722153620/http://www.adr.lu/index.php?id=22 |archivedate=2011-07-22 |language=de |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1989|1989 election]] to the Chamber of Deputies, on 18 June 1989, the party achieved remarkable success by attracting votes from far beyond its core support base. Many Luxembourgers voted for the ADR as a [[protest vote]], allowing the ADR to register 7.3% of the vote, win 4 of the 60 seats, and come fourth.&lt;ref name="ADR Geschicht" /&gt; The spectacular triumph of the party in the election required the leadership to formulate a new party strategy. On 12 November 1989, the name was amended to 'Action Committee 5/6ths' (''Aktiounskomitee 5/6''), reflecting its increased attention to other concerns.&lt;ref name="ADR Geschicht" /&gt; The party lost one of its deputies, [[Josy Simon]], when he defected to the [[Democratic Party (Luxembourg)|Democratic Party]] in spring 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hirsch |first=Mario |authorlink=Mario Hirsch |date=December 1992 |title=Luxembourg |journal=[[European Journal of Political Research]] |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=469–470 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6765.1992.tb00334.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November 1992, the name was changed again, to 'Action Committee for Democracy and Pensions Justice' (''Aktiounskomitee fir Demokratie an Rentengerechtigkeet'').&lt;ref name="ADR Geschicht" /&gt; In December of the same year, the prominent deputy [[Fernand Rau]] defected from the [[Christian Social People's Party]] (CSV) after it broke its pledge to make him [[European Commissioner]], increasing the ADR's representation back up to four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hirsch |first=Mario |authorlink=Mario Hirsch |date=December 1993 |title=Luxembourg |journal=[[European Journal of Political Research]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=491–494 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6765.1993.tb00402.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 10 October 1993 local elections, the ADR won 7 seats in [[Communes of Luxembourg|communal]] councils. At the [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1994|1994 general election]], the ADR got 9.0% of the vote and 5 seats, putting the ADR over the threshold required to qualify as a [[caucus]], but the ADR fell to fifth place, behind the resurgent [[The Greens (Luxembourg)|Greens]].&lt;ref name="ADR Geschicht" /&gt;

===Mainstream party===
On 3 August 1998, a law was passed equalising pension provision between civil servants and other workers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1998/0070/a070.pdf#page=2 | title=Mémorial A, 1998, No. 70 | accessdate=2008-04-20 | format=PDF | publisher=Service central de législation|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; fulfilling the ADR's original ''raison d'être'', but this did not prevent the ADR from strengthening its position further. In the [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1999|1999 legislative election]], the party enjoyed increased success, winning 9.4% of the vote and 7 seats. The results put the ADR back into fourth place, but the Greens managed to hold on to their seat in the simultaneous [[European Parliament election, 1999 (Luxembourg)|European elections]].&lt;ref name="ADR Geschicht" /&gt; October 1999 saw ADR candidates elected in ten communes, with two winning in each of [[Luxembourg City]] and [[Esch-sur-Alzette]].&lt;ref name="ADR Geschicht" /&gt; The ADR lost two of its Chamber of Deputies seats at the [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 2004|2004 general election]], and its share of the vote fell to under 10%.&lt;ref name="ADR Geschicht" /&gt;

One of ADR's hallmark positions is its [[euroscepticism]], and it is the only eurosceptic party in the Chamber of Deputies.&lt;ref name="Luxembourg ratifies Lisbon treaty"&gt;{{cite news |first=Zoë |last=Casey |title=Luxembourg ratifies Lisbon treaty |url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2008/05/2602/luxembourg-ratifies-lisbon-treaty/60991.aspx |publisher=[[European Voice]] |date=30 May 2008 |accessdate=June 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only parliamentary party that actively campaigned against the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]], which was [[Luxembourgian European Constitution referendum, 2005|put to a referendum]] and narrowly passed with 56.5% of voters in favour.

On 2 April 2006 the name was changed once more, to its current name of 'Alternative Democratic Reform Party' (''Alternativ Demokratesch Reformpartei'').&lt;ref name="ADR Geschicht" /&gt; Significantly, for the first time, the name makes no reference to pension reform, signalling the eagerness of the ADR to further solidify its position as a major party in national politics. However, on 1 May, [[Aly Jaerling]] left the party to sit as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] in the Chamber of Deputies, complaining of the move away from campaigning for pensions.&lt;ref name="Jaerling prend la tangente"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paperjam.lu/c/articles/15245.html |title=ADR: Jaerling prend la tangente |accessdate=2006-08-23 |date=2006-04-21 |publisher=PaperJam.lu|language=fr}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Jaerling's departure, the party lost its status as a caucus and now only qualifies as a 'group', threatening its future security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investigateur.info/zines/textes/315_3.html |title=Le hara-kiri d’Aly Jaerling |accessdate=2006-08-23 |year=2006 |publisher=L'investigateur |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506143726/http://www.investigateur.info/zines/textes/315_3.html |archivedate=May 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2008, the ADR deputies and Jaerling were the only members not to vote for the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]. In the [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 2009|2009 Chamber election]], the ADR held on to four seats (of which, 2 in [[Circonscription Sud (Luxembourg)|Sud]]), but with a reduced vote share of 8.1%: its worst legislative election result since its first election, in 1989, whilst its vote share fell - albeit by less - in the simultaneous [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Luxembourg)|European Parliament election]], to 7.4%. Jaerling, running for his own [[Citizens' List]], failed to win a seat in either. This had been in spite of strong pre-election polling, the difference likely to be attributable to the financial crisis pushing voters to more familiar parties.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

On 8 June 2010, the ADR joined the [[Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe]], a Euro-Realist [[European political party|Europe-wide political party]].&lt;ref&gt; http://ecrgroup.eu/about-us/our-history/ &lt;/ref&gt; In the snap-election of 2013, the ADR once again fell in their share of the vote, from 8.14% to 6.64%. However, they did manage to regain one seat, having fallen to only two MPs after the defections of [[Jacques-Yves Henckes]] and [[Jean Colombera]]. The former sat out the 2009-2013 legislative period as an independent, the latter founded the [[Party for Full Democracy]]. [[Roy Reding]] regained the mandate in the Centre district, putting the party back at 3 mandates.

During the [[Luxembourg constitutional referendum, 2015 | Constitutional Referendum Campaign of 2015]], the ADR was the only party to explicitly campaign for the "3 x No" vote, thereby rejecting the opening of the right to vote for 16 year-olds and foreign residents, as well as rejecting the idea of limiting minister mandates to 10 years. This campaign was in stark contrast to the campaign of the largest party, the CSV, whose main message was to "be informed" when voting. With each question being rejected by between 70% and 80% of the electorate &lt;ref&gt;http://www.elections.public.lu/content/dam/elections/fr/referendum/2015/resultats-officiels/referendum-resultats-officiels.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, this event represented a big political win for the ADR in face of the incumbent Government. 

3 years after the Referendum, on the 2nd March 2018, the ADR announced that it would be co-operating with the citizen's movement [[Wee 2050 - Nee 2015]], which had been founded pre-referendum to campaign for the "3 x No". The cooperation agreement involved Wee 2050 having up to 8 places on the ADR's electoral lists for the legislative election of October 2018, and ensured that the movement could remain relatively independent by not requiring the Wee 2050 candidates to be members of the ADR per se.

==Ideology==
The party was founded as a single-issue party, to introduce equality between private and public sector pensions.  The focus on pension reform allowed it to make it the core campaign issue of all five elections in the first ten years of its formation.&lt;ref&gt;Immergut et al (2007), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1998, the party had forced the government to accede almost all of its demands.&lt;ref name="Immergut 838"&gt;Immergut et al (2007), p. 838&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this success has not thwarted the ADR,&lt;ref name="Immergut 838" /&gt; and it has diversified its programme to cover all aspects of public policy.

The party is a supporter of [[economic liberalism]], having positioned itself to fill a void left by the [[Democratic Party (Luxembourg)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="Dumont 66" /&gt;  The party is critical of public sector waste and the 'elitist' nature of public spending projects.&lt;ref name="Pensioners' parties in Eastern" /&gt;  The ADR is [[social conservatism|socially conservative]].  It is opposed to [[euthanasia]] and [[assisted suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumont et al (2006), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;  The party places great importance on promoting the [[Luxembourgish language]], and its electoral success in the [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1999|1999 election]] pushed the CSV-DP government to make knowledge of it a criterion for [[naturalization|naturalisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Acquisition and Loss of Nationality: Policies and Trends in 15 European States – Volume 2: Country Analysis |editor1-first=Rainer |editor1-last=Bauböck |editor2-first=Eva |editor2-last=Ersbøll |editor3-first=Kees |editor3-last=Groenendijk |editor4-first=Harald |editor4-last=Waldrauch |first=François |last=Moyse |author2=Brasseur, Pierre|author3= Scuto, Denis |year=2004 |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |location=Amsterdam |chapter=Luxembourg |isbn=978-90-5356-921-4 |page=380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is opposed to [[multiple citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Acquisition and Loss of Nationality: Policies and Trends in 15 European States |last=Bauböck |first=Rainer |author2=Ersboll, Eva |year=2006 |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |location=Amsterdam |page=237 |isbn=978-90-5356-920-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nFmjkTnXNQAC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party is marked out from the other parties by being [[Eurosceptic]],&lt;ref&gt;Dumont et al (2006), p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; sharing this position with only the [[far left]],&lt;ref name="Dumont 95"&gt;Dumont et al (2006), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; and being the country's most [[Souverainism|sovereigntist]] party.&lt;ref name="Maier 144"&gt;Maier et al (2004), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;  The leadership had supported the proposed [[European Constitution]], endorsing it in the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Luxembourg)|2004 European election]],&lt;ref name="Maier 144" /&gt; before changing its position in the spring of 2005 under pressure from party members.&lt;ref&gt;Dumont et al (2006), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;  In its criticism of the [[European Union|EU]], the party puts emphasis on the [[democratic deficit]] and [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]].&lt;ref name="Dumont 95" /&gt;  However, in heavily [[pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] Luxembourg, the ADR had always fared worse in European elections than on national elections, which were held on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Maier et al (2004), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; This was the case only until 2014, when the party achieved a slightly better score than it had in the early 2013 national elections, managing to beat the [[LSAP]] in the majority of communes.

==Political support==
The ADR's primary political base are the CSV's 'traditional, rural and rightist' voters.&lt;ref&gt;Van Hecke et al (2004), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the ADR is seen to take votes from the right wing of the CSV,&lt;ref&gt;Van Hecke et al (2004), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; more ADR voters declare themselves to be [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] than either the CSV or DP.&lt;ref&gt;Van Hecke et al (2004), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the party's support is in the north of the country,&lt;ref name="Dumont 124"&gt;Dumont et al (2006), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; where the ADR received its strongest support in the 1999 (16.7%), 2004 (14.7%) and [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 2009|2009 Chamber elections]] (10.3%). In 2013 however it received its highest share of the vote in the [[Est (Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg constituency)|Est]] constituency.

Due to the party's original purpose of pension equality, the party's electoral base is pensioners.  However, disproportionately many people under the age of 24 also see the ADR in a positive light.&lt;ref&gt;Dumont et al (2006), p. 127–8&lt;/ref&gt;  ADR is particularly popular on the [[Internet]], despite the party leadership's lack of interest in the medium, due in part to its popularity amongst young people.&lt;ref&gt;Dumont et al (2006), p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;  The party is most popular amongst people earning less than €30,000,&lt;ref name="Dumont 124" /&gt; and has attracted support from the part of the CSV's core electorate that have been left out of recent economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Van Hecke et al (2004), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;  As with the CSV and LSAP, the ADR is supported by people with less education.&lt;ref&gt;Van Hecke et al (2004), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The party is backed by the third-largest general trade union in the country, the small [[Neutral Union of Luxembourg Workers]] (NGL), which has been the driving force behind the ADR.&lt;ref name="Immergut 815"&gt;Immergut et al (2007), p. 815&lt;/ref&gt;  The ADR has also been close to the [[Luxembourg Association of Retired and Invalid People]] (LRIV), which formerly backed the [[Communist Party of Luxembourg|Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="Immergut 815" /&gt;  The party has used local celebrities, such as [[Jean-Pierre Koepp]] in [[Circonscription Nord (Luxembourg)|Nord]], to boost its appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Immergut et al (2007), p. 849&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations''' (A.B.N.) was a co-ordinating center for anti-Communist [[émigré]] political organizations from Soviet and other socialist countries. The A.B.N. formation dates back to an underground conference of representatives of non-[[Russians|Russian]] peoples that took place on November 1943, near [[Zhytomyr]] on the initiative of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]]. During the conference, a platform of joint [[revolutionary]] struggle against what the participants called ''Russian [[communism]]'' was formulated. The goal of the A.B.N. was to remove communists from power, abolish the [[Soviet Union]] and divide it into national states. Given an organizational structure in [[Munich]] in 1946, the A.B.N. extended its range of activity and began to include Eastern European emigration from other countries apart from [[Ukraine]]. 

Member organisation for various times: 
*[["Free Armenia" Committee]], ([[Armenia]])
*[[Bulgarian National Front]], ([[Bulgaria]])
*[[Belarusian Central Rada]], ([[Belarus]])
*[[Cossack National Liberation Movement]], (see [[Cossack]]s)
*[[Croatian National Liberation Movement]], ([[Croatia]])
*[[Czech Movement for Freedom]] (Za Svobodu), ([[Czech Republic]])
*[[Czech National Committee]],
*[[Estonian Liberation Movement]], ([[Estonia]])
*[[Union of the Estonian Fighters for Freedom]],
*[[Georgian National Organization]], ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]])
*[[Hungarian Liberation Movement]], ([[Hungary]])
*[[Hungarian Mindszenty Movement]],
*[[Latvian Association for the Struggle against Communism]], ([[Latvia]])
*[[Lithuanian Rebirth Movement]], ([[Lithuania]])
*[[Slovak Liberation Committee]], ([[Slovakia]])
*[[National Turkestanian Unity Committee]], ([[Turkestan]])
*[[United Hetman Organization]], (see [[Hetman]])
*[[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists-Bandera]] ([[Ukraine]])

The most active groups among the Bloc were the Ukrainian national organizations.

The A.B.N. was headed by [[Yaroslav Stetsko]], a Ukrainian nationalist&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CS%5CT%5CStetskoYaroslav.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]] politician, from the time of foundation until 1986, the year of his death. Stetsko was succeeded by his widow, [[Slava Stetsko]]. The chairmen of the A.B.N. Peoples' Council included V. Bērziņš, V. Kajum-Khan, [[Ferdinand Ďurčanský|F. Ďurčanský]], [[Ferenc Farkas de Kisbarnak|F. Farkas de Kisbarnak]], and [[Radasłaŭ Astroŭski|R. Ostrowski]]. The long-time general secretaries were Dr. [[Niko Nakashidze]]&lt;ref&gt;"The Truth About A.B.N." by Niko Nakashidze, A.B.N. Press, Munich, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; and C. Pokorný. 

The headquarters and cells of the A.B.N. organized mass anti-Soviet rallies, protest demonstrations, press conferences, and international congresses, and the distribution of various memoranda. The A.B.N. co-operated with the [[World Anti-Communist League]] (WACL) and the [[European Freedom Council]] (EFC). Representatives from the A.B.N. and related organizations participated in the congresses of the WACL and EFC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/A/N/Anti6BolshevikBlocofNations.htm Encyclopedia of Ukraine].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations was disbanded in 1996 after the collapse of the [[USSR]] and Soviet communism.

'''Birgitta Karlström Dorph''' (born 5{{nbsp}}June 1939) is a Swedish diplomat. She is mostly known for her clandestine work in channeling funds from the Swedish government to the [[Internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid movement]] in South Africa during the 1980s.

== Early life and education ==
Märta Birgitta Karlström Dorph grew up in [[Karlstad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johansson|first1=Sven L-O|title=Karlstadstösen som blev diplomat i Afrika|trans-title=The gal from Karlstad who became diplomat in Africa|url=http://www.vf.se/nyheter/allman/karlstadstosen-som-blev-diplomat-i-afrika|website=www.vf.se|date=13 August 2013|publisher=[[Värmlands Folkblad]]|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she went to the [[Tingvallagymnasiet]]. After graduating she studied in the United States, attended the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] and worked in France. She finally entered an education at the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]] where she remained and worked as a diplomat for 44 years.&lt;ref name=svt1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karlsson|first1=Inger|title=Hon var "Palmes hemliga agent"|trans-title=She was Palme's secret agent|url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/regionalt/varmland/hon-var-palmes-hemliga-agent|website=www.svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|date=1 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
During twenty of Karlström Dorph's years within the diplomatic corps she worked in Africa where she was stationed in [[Addis Ababa]], Ethiopia and [[Gaborone]], Botswana, among other places. In 1982–88, she worked in [[Pretoria]], South Africa.&lt;ref name=svt1 /&gt;

== Secret mission ==
While stationed as second in command at the [[List of diplomatic missions of Sweden|Swedish legation]]{{efn|At the time the Swedish embassy in South Africa was called a "legation".&lt;ref name=NAI /&gt;}} in Pretoria and working as a diplomat,&lt;ref name=expressen1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Claes|title=Hon var Palmes hemliga agent|trans-title=She was Palme's secret agent|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/hon-var-palmes-hemliga-agent/|website=www.expressen.se|date=24 September 2015|publisher=[[Expressen]]|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; she also had a secret mission. Her job was to get in contact with the leaders of the then prohibited anti-apartheid movement in South Africa and Namibia,&lt;ref name=NAI&gt;{{cite web|title=Birgitta Karlström-Dorph|url=http://www.liberationafrica.se/intervstories/interviews/karlstrom-dorph/?by-name=1|website=www.liberationafrica.se|publisher=[[Nordic Africa Institute]]|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and find ways to transfer money from Sweden to support their cause.&lt;ref name=svt1 /&gt; The operation was initiated by [[Olof Palme]] and the Swedish government. These arrangements were clandestine and were not discussed in public in the [[Riksdag]]. A total sum of about SEK 1.6 billion ($200 million)&lt;ref name=expressen1 /&gt; were transferred to the [[African National Congress]] and other organizations.&lt;ref name=svt1 /&gt; Karlström Dorph established a contact net of recipients and ways to transfer the money. Information about the transfers were sent as [[Encryption|encrypted]] [[Telegraphy|telegrams]], by couriers or as hidden messages in gifts.&lt;ref name=expressen1 /&gt; The money came mainly from the humanitarian [[Government agencies in Sweden|government agency]] [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (SIDA) but could not be channeled directly since officially, Sweden was not giving any aid to South Africa.&lt;ref name=NAI /&gt;

A significant part of the money was used for legal help in defending black persons accused of breaking any of the [[Apartheid legislation|apartheid laws]] that were in effect at the time. This help led to a number of people escaping the death penalty, or had their jail sentences drastically reduced. Money also went to churches, newspapers, unions and women's organizations and the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]].&lt;ref name=expressen1 /&gt;

{{quote|"I used my ears, my eyes, all my senses, and my heart." (about knowing who to trust during her secret mission)|Birgitta Karlström Dorph&lt;ref name=Mandela&gt;{{cite web|title=Veteran activists remember apartheid trial|url=https://www.nelsonmandela.org/news/entry/veteran-activists-remember-apartheid-trial|date=14 March 2008|website=www.nelsonmandela.org|publisher=Nelson Mandela Foundation|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Recognitions ==
Karlström Dorph has been celebrated as a hero among the South African anti-apartheid activists and she was invited to a birthday party for [[Nelson Mandela]] as well as the ANC's centennial celebration.&lt;ref name=expressen1 /&gt;

In 2015, the [[Sveriges Television]] made a documentary about Karlström Dorph called ''Palmes hemliga agent'' ("Palme's secret agent").&lt;ref name=agent&gt;{{cite web|title=Palmes hemliga agent|trans-title=Palme's secret agent|url=http://www.svt.se/dokumentarfilm/palmes-hemliga-agent|website=www.svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|date=1 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Karlström Dorph has five children and her husband is deceased.&lt;ref name=agent /&gt; She had kept her mission in South Africa a secret from her family up until the documentary about her was made. She says that when her children saw the film "They clapped their hands and gave me a high five!"&lt;ref name=expressen1 /&gt;

{{As of|2015}}, she still works for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs from time to time.&lt;ref name=svt1 /&gt; She currently lives in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web|title=Märta Birgitta Karlström Dorph|url=http://www.merinfo.se/person/Stockholm/M%C3%A4rta-Birgitta-Dorph-1939/bjlvx-kri0|website=www.merinfo.se|publisher=Merinfo|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Black-box}}
In [[science studies]], the social process of '''blackboxing''' is based on the abstract notion of a [[black box]]. To cite  [[Bruno Latour]], blackboxing is "the way scientific and technical work is made invisible by its own success. When a machine runs efficiently, when a matter of fact is settled, one need focus only on its inputs and outputs and not on its internal complexity. Thus, paradoxically, the more science and technology succeed, the more opaque and obscure they become."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bruno Latour|title=Pandora's hope: essays on the reality of science studies|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]. p. 304|location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Social constructivist]] approaches to science and technology studies, such as [[Social construction of technology]] (SCOT) often revolve around "opening the black box", or attempting to understand the internal workings of a given system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The social construction of technological systems: New directions in the sociology and history of technology|year=1987|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=21–22|author1=Pinch, Trevor  |author2=Wiebe E. Bijker |lastauthoramp=yes |editor1=Wiebe E. Bijker |editor2=Thomas Hughes |editor3=Trevor Pinch |chapter=The Social Construction of Facts and Artefacts: or How the Sociology of Science and the Sociology of Technology might Benefit Each Other}}&lt;/ref&gt; This then allows the researcher to provide empirical models of technological change that are specific and better able to describe the events that took place during the development of the technology.  This approach has also been criticized by scholars such as [[Langdon Winner]] for being excessively formulaic in its methods and too narrow in its focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winner|first=Langdon|title=Upon opening the black box and finding it empty: Social constructivism and the philosophy of technology|journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values|year=1993|volume=18|issue=3|pages=365–368|doi=10.1177/016224399301800306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the "black box" is also important in [[Actor–network theory]] as it relates to simplification.  As [[Michel Callon]] notes, an actor-network is a system of discrete entities or nodes, while the reality that it represents is theoretically infinite.  Therefore, in order to describe something in terms of an actor-network, complex systems must be simplified down to individual nodes, ignoring their internal workings and focusing only on their interactions with other nodes within the network.  However, if the simplified "black box" is insufficient modeling the system in question, it must be opened, creating a "swarm of new actors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mapping the Dynamics of Science and Technology: Sociology of Science in the Real World|year=1986|publisher=Sheridan House Inc|isbn=0333372239|pages=29–30|author=Michel Callon|authorlink=Michel Callon|editor1=Callon, M. |editor2=Law, J. |editor3=Rip, A. |chapter=The sociology of an actor-network: The case of the electric vehicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bonnie Hart''' is an artist, film maker, and [[intersex human rights]] activist, born with [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] and president of the [[Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia]]. Hart performs nationally and internationally, and speaks on intersex issues nationally and internationally. In 2016, Australia's ''[[SX News|Gay News Network]]'' included her in their "25 LGBTI people to watch in 2017".&lt;ref name="watch-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://oii.org.au/24704/intersex-inclusion-2014-sydney-mardi-gras-parade/ | title = Intersex inclusion in the 2014 Sydney Mardi Gras Parade | work = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] | date = 3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Hart describes how she was told she experienced "heteronormative sexual training from a really early age", through multiple [[intersex medical interventions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1960">The title '''director''' has been used in colonial administrations not only as a bureaucratic rank and for the members of a board of directors, but also specifically, as in this article, for the head of the colonial administration of a territory (e.g. [[protectorate]]) under [[indirect rule]] by a [[chartered company]], functionally equivalent to a [[governor]]. 

Elsewhere, the same function went by the -in principle higher- title [[director-general (colonial)|director-general]], as in [[Demerara-Essequibo]] (Dutch Guyana).

* from 5 June 1885 the [[Niger Districts Protectorate]] (under the [[United African Company]]) was administered by Sir George Goldie (1846–1925), till it became on 10 July 1886 the [[Niger River Delta Protectorate]] (under the [[Royal Niger Company]], which appointed two consecutive [[Governor]]s, the second being the same Sir George Goldie). 
* the short-lived (1613–1623) English trading post at [[Hirado]] (Japan) had a single Director: Richard Cocks

Director, or rather its equivalent in the colonizer's language, was similarly used elsewhere:
* ''Directeur'', in Caribbean possessions under Dutch WIC ([[Dutch West India Company|West India Company]]) administration:
**[[Aruba]] 1833–1848 only three incumbents, the first having been the last [[Commandeur]], the last becoming the first [[gezaghebber]]
**[[Curaçao]] 1634–1792 and once more 1828–1833 (Isaäk Johannes Rammelman Elsevier), at other times various other titles were in use, mostly Governor
* ''Directeur'' of [[Dutch Bengal]] (a few factories in [[Dutch India]]), from 1635 (till 1655 however filled by the governors of [[Dutch Coromandel|Coromandel]]) till the 1795 annexation to British India

'''''Down and Out in Paris and London''''' is the first full-length work by the English author [[George Orwell]], published in 1933. It is a [[memoir]]&lt;ref&gt;Back cover description, ''Down and Out in Paris and London'', Penguin Classics, 2001 {{ISBN|978-0141184388}}&lt;/ref&gt; in two parts on the theme of poverty in the two cities. The first part is an account of living in near-[[extreme poverty|destitution]] in Paris and the experience of casual labour in restaurant kitchens. The second part is a travelogue of life on the road in and around London from the [[tramp]]'s perspective, with descriptions of the types of hostel accommodation available and some of the characters to be found living on the margins.

==Background==
After giving up his post as a policeman in Burma to become a writer, Orwell moved to rooms in [[Portobello Road]], London at the end of 1927 when he was 24.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Pitter ''BBC Overseas Service broadcast'' 3 January 1956&lt;/ref&gt; While contributing to various journals, he undertook investigative tramping expeditions in and around London, collecting material for use in "[[The Spike (essay)|The Spike]]", his first published essay, and for the latter half of ''Down and Out in Paris and London''. In spring of 1928 he moved to Paris and lived at 6 Rue du Pot de Fer in [[Latin Quarter, Paris|the Latin Quarter]],&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, p. vii, Penguin Classics 2001 edition&lt;/ref&gt; a bohemian quarter with a cosmopolitan flavour. American writers like [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] had lived in the same area.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Following the Russian Revolution, there was a large Russian emigre community in Paris. Orwell's aunt Nellie Limouzin also lived in Paris and gave him social and, when necessary, financial support. He led an active social life,&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Graves Letter 23 July 1949 in Complete Works XX 150&lt;/ref&gt; worked on his novels and had several articles published in avant-garde journals.
[[File:Rue du Pot-de-Fer.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Orwell's Paris street, in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]]: "tall old-fashioned windows and dark grey leaded roofs; not far from the [[École Normale Supérieure]]—earlier in the twenties, [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] had lived only {{convert|500|yd|m}} from Orwell's street; [[Elliot Paul]] was then still living in his own 'narrow street', the Rue de la Huchette, in the same ''arrondissement'' down by the river near the [[Place Saint-Michel]]; and once, at the [[Les Deux Magots|Deux Magots]] in 1928, Orwell thought he saw [[James Joyce]]."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Mayne, ''The World of George Orwell'' pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Orwell fell seriously ill in March 1929 and shortly afterwards had money stolen from the lodging house. The thief was probably not the young Italian described in ''Down and Out''. In a later account, he said the theft was the work of a young trollop that he had picked up and brought back with him;&lt;ref&gt;Mabel Fierz in Audrey Coppard and Bernard Crick ''Orwell Remembered'' 1984&lt;/ref&gt; it has been submitted that "consideration for his parents' sensibilities would have required the suppression of this misadventure. Whoever reduced Orwell to destitution did him a good turn; his final ten weeks in Paris sowed the seed of his first published book."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dervla Murphy]], Introduction, Penguin edition, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Whether through necessity or just to collect material, and probably both, he undertook casual work as a dishwasher in restaurants. In August 1929 he sent a copy of "The Spike" to the ''[[Adelphi (magazine)|Adelphi]]'' magazine in London, and it was accepted for publication. Orwell left Paris in December 1929 and returned to England, going straight home to his parents' house in [[Southwold]]. Later he acted as a private tutor to a handicapped child there and also undertook further tramping expeditions, culminating in a stint working in the Kent hop fields in August and September 1931. After this adventure, he ended up in the [[Tooley Street]] kip, which he found so unpleasant that he wrote home for money and moved to more comfortable lodgings.&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Taylor ''Orwell: The Life'' Chatto &amp; Windus. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Orwell's first version of ''Down and Out'' was called "A Scullion's Diary". Completed in October 1930,&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, p. ix ''[[Penguin Classics]]'', 2001 edition&lt;/ref&gt; it used only his Paris material. He offered it to [[Jonathan Cape]] in the summer of 1931. Cape rejected it in the autumn.&lt;ref name="An Age Like This"&gt;Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds.). ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1: An Age Like This (1920–1940)'' (Penguin)&lt;/ref&gt; A year later he offered "a fatter typescript (the London chapters had been added)" to [[Faber &amp; Faber]], where [[T. S. Eliot]], then an editorial director, also rejected it, stating, "We did find it of very great interest, but I regret to say that it does not appear to me possible as a publishing venture."&lt;ref name="An Age Like This"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mishan/&gt;

It was in the home of Mabel Fierz that Orwell then discarded the typescript. She had, with her husband, a London businessman named Francis, been for a number of years a visitor to Southwold in the summer and was on friendly terms with the Blairs. Fierz at this point took it to a [[literary agent]], [[Leonard Moore (literary agent)|Leonard Moore]], who "recognised it as a 'natural' for the new house of Gollancz."&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, Penguin 1989 edition, p. x&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Gollancz]] was prepared to publish the work, subject to the removal of [[bad language]] and some identifiable names, and offered an advance of £40. The title improvised by Gollancz, ''Confessions of a Down and Outer'', bothered Orwell. "Would ''The Confessions of a Dishwasher'' do as well?" he asked Moore. "I would ''rather'' answer to ''dishwasher'' than ''down &amp; out''."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Michael Shelden, ''Orwell'', p. 180. In July 1932, Orwell had suggested calling the book ''The Lady Poverty'' referencing a poem of [[Alice Meynell]]; in August 1932, he suggested ''In Praise of Poverty'' (''A Kind of Compulsion'', Secker &amp; Warburg pp. 253, 261).&lt;/ref&gt; At the last minute, Gollancz shortened the title to ''Down and Out in Paris and London''. The author, after possibilities including "X," "P.S. Burton" (an alias Orwell had used on tramping expeditions), "Kenneth Miles" and "H. Lewis Allways" had been considered,&lt;ref&gt;Shelden, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; was renamed "George Orwell." Orwell did not wish to publish under his own name Eric Blair, and Orwell was the name he used from then on for his main works—although many periodical articles were still published under the name Eric Blair. ''Down and Out in Paris and London'' was published on 9 January 1933 and received favourable reviews from, among others, [[C. Day Lewis]], [[WH Davies]], [[Compton Mackenzie]] and [[JB Priestley]]. It was subsequently published by [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] in New York. Sales were low, however, until December 1940, when [[Penguin Books]] printed 55,000 copies for sale at sixpence.

A French translation, which Orwell admired, by RN Raimbault and Gwen Gilbert, entitled ''{{lang|fr|La Vache Enragée}}'', was published by [[Éditions Gallimard]], on 2 May 1935, with a preface by [[Panait Istrati]]&lt;ref&gt;A Kind of Compulsion, 1903–36, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; and an introduction by Orwell.&lt;ref name="french"&gt;''Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'' volume I, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

===Chapters I–XXIII (Paris)===
The scene-setting opening chapters describe the atmosphere in the Paris quarter and introduce various characters who appear later in the book. From Chapter III to Chapter X, where the narrator obtains a job at "Hotel X," he describes his descent into poverty, often in tragi-comic terms. An Italian compositor forges room keys and steals his savings and his scant income vanishes when the English lessons he is giving stop. He begins at first to sell some of his clothes, and then to [[pawnbroker|pawn]] his remaining clothes, and then searches for work with a Russian waiter named Boris—work as a [[porter (carrier)|porter]] at [[Les Halles]], work as an English teacher and restaurant work. He recounts his two-day experience without any food and tells of meeting Russian "Communists" who, he later concludes, on their disappearance, must be mere swindlers.

After the various ordeals of unemployment and hunger the narrator obtains a job as a ''plongeur'' (dishwasher) in the "Hôtel X" near the [[Place de la Concorde]], and begins to work long hours there. In Chapter XIII, he describes the "caste system" of the hotel—"manager-cooks-waiters-plongeurs"—and, in Chapter XIV, its frantic and seemingly chaotic workings. He notes also "the dirt in the Hôtel X.," which became apparent "as soon as one penetrated into the service quarters." He talks of his routine life among the [[working poor]] of Paris, slaving and sleeping, and then drinking on Saturday night through the early hours of Sunday morning. In Chapter XVI, he refers briefly to a murder committed "just beneath my window [while he was sleeping .... The thing that strikes me in looking back," he says, "is that I was in bed and asleep within three minutes of the murder [....] We were working people, and where was the sense of wasting sleep over a murder?"

Misled by Boris's optimism, the narrator is briefly penniless again after he and Boris quit their hotel jobs in the expectation of work at a new restaurant, the "Auberge de Jehan Cottard," where Boris feels sure he will become a waiter again; at the Hotel X, he had been doing lower-grade work. The "patron" of the Auberge, "an ex-colonel of the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]]," seems to have financial difficulties. The narrator is not paid for ten days and is compelled to spend a night on a bench—"It was very uncomfortable—the arm of the seat cuts into your back—and much colder than I had expected"—rather than face his landlady over the outstanding rent.

At the restaurant, the narrator finds himself working "seventeen and a half hours" a day, "almost without a break," and looking back wistfully at his relatively leisured and orderly life at the Hotel X. Boris works even longer: "eighteen hours a day, seven days a week." The narrator claims that "such hours, though not usual, are nothing extraordinary in Paris." He adds

&lt;blockquote&gt;by the way, that the Auberge was not the ordinary cheap eating-house frequented by students and workmen. We did not provide an adequate meal at less than twenty-five francs, and we were picturesque and artistic, which sent up our social standing. There were the indecent pictures in the bar, and the Norman decorations—sham beams on the walls, electric lights done up as candlesticks, "peasant" pottery, even a mounting-block at the door—and the ''patron'' and the head waiter were Russian officers, and many of the customers titled Russian refugees. In short, we were decidedly chic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He falls into a routine again and speaks of quite literally fighting for a place on the [[Paris Métro]] to reach the "cold, filthy kitchen" by seven. Despite the filth and incompetence, the restaurant turns out to be a success.

The narrative is interspersed with [[anecdote]]s recounted by some of the minor characters, such as Valenti, an Italian waiter at Hotel X, and Charlie, "one of the local curiosities," who is "a youth of family and education who had run away from home." In Chapter XXII, the narrator considers the life of a ''plongeur'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;[A] ''plongeur'' is one of the [[slavery|slaves]] of the modern world. Not that there is any need to whine over him, for he is better off than many [[manual labor|manual workers]], but still, he is no freer than if he were bought and sold. His work is servile and without art; he is paid just enough to keep him alive; his only holiday is the sack [.... He has] been trapped by a routine which makes thought impossible. If ''plongeurs'' thought at all, they would long ago have formed a labour union and gone on strike for better treatment. But they do not think, because they have no leisure for it; their life has made slaves of them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of the stress of the long hours, he mails to a friend, "B," back in London, asking if he could get him a job that allows more than five hours' sleep a night. His friend duly replies, offering a job taking care of a "congenital imbecile," and sends him some money to get his possessions from the pawn. The narrator then quits his job as a ''plongeur'' and leaves for London.

===Chapters XXIV–XXXVIII (London)===
The narrator arrives in London expecting to have the job waiting for him. Unfortunately the would-be employers have gone abroad, "patient and all."

Until his employers return, the narrator lives as a [[tramp]], sleeping in an assortment of venues: lodging houses, tramps' hostels or "spikes," and [[Salvation Army]] shelters. Because vagrants can not "enter any one spike, or any two London spikes, more than once in a month, on pain of being confined for a week," he is required to keep on the move, with the result that long hours are spent tramping or waiting for hostels to open. Chapters XXV to XXXV describe his various journeys, the different forms of accommodation, a selection of the people he meets, and the tramps' reaction to [[Charity (practice)|Christian charity]]: "Evidently the tramps were not grateful for their free tea. And yet it was excellent [....] I am sure too that it was given in a good spirit, without any intention of humiliating us; so in fairness we ought to have been grateful—still, we were not." Characters in this section of the book include the Irish tramp called Paddy, "a good fellow" whose "ignorance was limitless and appalling," and the [[Street painting|pavement artist]] Bozo, who has a good literary background and was formerly an amateur astronomer, but who has suffered a succession of misfortunes.

The final chapters provide a catalogue of various types of accommodation open to tramps. The narrator offers some general remarks, concluding,

&lt;blockquote&gt;At present I do not feel that I have seen more than the fringe of poverty. Still, I can point to one or two things I have definitely learned by being hard up. I shall never again think that all tramps are drunken scoundrels, nor expect a beggar to be grateful when I give him a penny, nor be surprised if men out of work lack energy, nor subscribe to the [[Salvation Army]], nor pawn my clothes, nor refuse a handbill, nor enjoy a meal at a smart restaurant. That is a beginning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Fact and fiction ==
One of the debates surrounding ''Down and Out'' is whether it was a piece of factual autobiography or part fiction. Orwell wrote in the Introduction to the 1935 French edition: "I think I can say that I have exaggerated nothing except in so far as all writers exaggerate by selecting. I did not feel that I had to describe events in the exact order in which they happened, but everything I have described did take place at one time or another." In Chapter XXIV, it is "clear that Orwell did distort facts by claiming on his return from Paris he found himself down and out in London and had not 'the slightest notion of how to get a cheap bed'. This of course heightens the tension [...] but the truth is that in Paris he had already written his first substantial essay, "[[The Spike (essay)|The Spike]]", describing a night spent in a [[Notting Hill]] tramps' hostel. Before his departure from England he had voluntarily lived among tramps for some time."&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, Penguin Classics 2001 edition, p. xiii–xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'', Orwell referred to the tramping experiences described in ''Down and Out'', writing that "nearly all the incidents described there actually happened, though they have been re-arranged."&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell ''The Road to Wigan Pier" Left Book Club 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; Some measure of the work's veracity may be gleaned from a marked-up copy, containing sixteen annotations, which Orwell gave to Brenda Salkeld. Of the descent into poverty from Chapter III, he wrote, "Succeeding chapters are not actually autobiography but drawn from what I have seen." Of Chapter VII, however, he wrote, "This all happened;" of Hotel X, "All as exact as I could make it;" and, of the Russian restaurant, "All the following is an entirely accurate description of the restaurant."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shelden ''Orwell: The Authorised Biography'' William Heinemann 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; On the personalities, Orwell's own introduction to the French edition states that the characters are individuals, but are "intended more as representative types."

The luxury hotel in which Orwell worked in the autumn of 1929 was identified as the [[Hôtel de Crillon|Crillon]] by [[Sonia Orwell]], as recounted by [[Sam White (foreign correspondent)|Sam White]], the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'''s Paris correspondent in his column for 16 June 1967. However, the writers Stansky and Abrahams have suggested, in their study of Orwell, that it was the Hotel Lotti.&lt;ref&gt;''A Kind of Compulsion 1903–36'' p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
Within a month of publication, Humbert Possenti, "a restaurateur and hotelier of forty years," had written to ''[[The Times]]'' complaining that the book was unfairly disparaging to the restaurant trade.&lt;ref&gt;Possenti, Humbert. "Hotel Kitchens." ''The Times'', 31 January 1933: 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' had previously reviewed ''Down and Out in Paris and London'', describing it as "a vivid picture of an apparently mad world."&lt;ref name=Google&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0FfsdUQc2OIC&amp;pg=PA60 Google Books] Scott Lucas, ''Orwell'' (2003) Haus Publishing,
{{ISBN|1904341330|978-1904341338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell responded to the restaurateur's criticism with a letter to the same newspaper: "I do know that in our hotel there were places which no customer could possibly have been allowed to see with any hope of retaining his custom."&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. "Hotel Kitchens." ''The Times'', 11 February 1933: 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Adelphi (magazine)|Adelphi]]'', [[C. Day Lewis]] wrote, "Orwell's book is a tour of the underworld, conducted without hysteria or prejudice [...] a model of clarity and good sense."&lt;ref name=Google/&gt; [[JB Priestley]], in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', considered it "uncommonly good reading. An excellent book and a valuable social document. The best book of its kind I have read in a long time."&lt;ref name=Google/&gt; [[Compton Mackenzie]] wrote of Orwell's "immensely interesting book [...] a genuine human document, which at the same time is written with so much artistic force that, in spite of the squalor and degradation thus unfolded, the result is curiously beautiful with the beauty of an accomplished etching on copper. The account of a casual ward in this country horrifies like some scene of inexplicable misery in [[Dante]]."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Orwell, The Transformation'', Stansky and Abrahams, Paladin, 1984 edn., p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the American publication, [[James T. Farrell]], writing in ''[[The New Republic]]'', called it "genuine, unexaggerated and intelligent," while Herbert Gorman wrote for the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'', "He possesses a keen eye for character and a rough-and-ready 'styleless style' that plunges along and makes the reader see what the author wants him to see." In contrast, the reviewer for ''[[New English Weekly]]'' wrote, "This book [...] is forcefully written and is very readable, yet it fails to carry conviction. We wonder if the author was really down and out. Down certainly, but out?"&lt;ref&gt;Reviews in the Orwell Archive, quoted by Bernard Crick '' Orwell: A Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyril Connolly]] later wrote, "I don't think ''Down and Out in London and Paris'' is more than agreeable journalism; it was all better done by his friend [[Henry Miller]]. Orwell found his true form a few years later."&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Connolly ''The Evening Colonnade&amp;nbsp;– George Orwell I'' Harcourt Brace Jovanovich 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell agreed with this assessment.&lt;ref name=mishan&gt;Mishan, Ligaya. [http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/bookclub/down-and-out-in "Down and Out in Paris and London."] ''[[The New Yorker]]''. 30 April 2009. Retrieved 2 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Miller's controversial work ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'' (1934) is based on his own experiences in Paris around the time Orwell was there.

In an essay for the 1971 ''The World of George Orwell'', [[Richard Mayne (administrator)|Richard Mayne]] considered the book as typical of something that was true of a great deal of Orwell's later writing: his "relish at revealing behind-the-scenes squalor. He was always taking the lid off things—poverty, parlour Socialism, life in a coal mine, prep-school tyranny, the Empire, the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], the [[propaganda|political misuse]] of [[language]]. He might well have echoed [[W.H. Auden]]: ''All I have is a voice/To undo the folded lie.''"&lt;ref&gt;Richard Mayne, ''The World of George Orwell'', p. 45 Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrator's comments on Jews in the book are cited by a journalist for ''[[Haaretz]]'' when considering what he terms "Orwell’s latent anti-Semitism".&lt;ref name=haarz&gt;Pfeffer, Anshel (2012). "[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/was-orwell-an-anti-semite-1.455763 Was Orwell an anti-Semite?]" ''Haaretz Group''. Retrieved 2014-07-05&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest the work may have been Orwell's [[parody]] of his own social upbringing and social class, noticing the narrator has both racist and anti-racist outbursts.&lt;ref name=Mendes&gt;{{Cite book|last=Philip|first=Mendes|year=2014|title=Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=62|isbn=9781-137008305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Isl&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shindler|first=Colin|year=2011|title=Israel and the European Left: Between Solidarity and Delegitimization (Google eBook)|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|page=91|isbn=978-1137008305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another commentator cites the book as evidence that anti-Semitism was much more prevalent in Paris than in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aberbach|first=David|year=Mar 1972|title=The European Jews, Patriotism and the Liberal State, 1789-1939: A Study of Literature and Social Psychology|publisher=Routledge|page=32|isbn=978-0415540131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1931">'''Drug Efficacy Study Implementation''' ('''DESI''') was a program begun by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in the 1960s after the requirement (in the [[Kefauver Harris Amendment|Kefauver-Harris Drug Control Act]]) that all [[drug]]s be efficacious as well as safe, was made part of US law. The DESI program was intended to classify all pre-1962 drugs that were already on the market as either effective, ineffective, or needing further study.&lt;Ref&gt;Pharmacy Today. August 2008.

By 1984, final action had been completed on 3,443 products; of these, 2,225 were found to be effective, 1,051 were found not effective, and 167 were pending.

One of the early effects of the DESI study was the development of the [[Abbreviated New Drug Application]] (ANDA).

This article describes '''ethnic minorities in Czechoslovakia''' from 1918 until 1992.

== Background ==
[[Image:Czechoslovakia 1930 linguistic map - created 2008-10-30.svg|450px|right|thumb|Linguistic map of Czechoslovakia (1930)]]

[[Czechoslovakia]] was founded as a country in the aftermath of [[World War I]] with its borders set out in the [[Treaty of Trianon]] and  [[Treaty of Versailles]], though the new borders were [[de facto]] established about a year prior. One of the main objects of these treaties was to secure independence for minorities previously living within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] or to reunify them with an existent nation-state.

However some territorial claims were based on economic grounds instead of ethnic ones, for instance the Czechoslovak borders with Poland (to include coal fields and a railway connection between Bohemia and Slovakia) and Hungary (on economic and strategic grounds), which resulted in successor states with percentages of minorities almost as high as in [[Austria-Hungary]] before.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh LeCaine Agnew,[https://books.google.com/books?id=PW_Oo2PQwocC&amp;pg=PA175 The Czechs and the lands of the Bohemian crown] , Hoover Press, 2004, p. 177 {{ISBN|978-0-817-94492-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Czechoslovakia had the highest proportion of minorities, who constituted 32.4% of the population.&lt;ref name="portions"&gt;{{cite book

After WWII the Jewish and Romani minorities had been exterminated by the Nazis, and most Germans and many Hungarians were expelled under the [[Beneš decrees]]. Other minority groups migrated to Czechoslovakia, [[Roma in the Czech Republic|Roma]] from Hungary and Romania, [[Bulgarians in Czechoslovakia|Bulgarians]] fleeing the Soviet troops, [[Greeks in the Czech Republic|Greeks]] and [[Macedonians in the Czech Republic|Macedonians]] fleeing the [[Greek Civil War]], then migrant workers and students came from other Communist bloc countries, [[Vietnamese people in the Czech Republic|Vietnamese]] and [[Koreans in the Czech Republic|Koreans]].

== Linguistic rights in the First Republic ==
According to article 128 §3 of [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920#Language law|the 1920 Constitution]] "Citizens of the Czechoslovak Republic may, within the limits of the common law, freely use any language they chose in private and business intercourse, in all matters pertaining to religion, in the press and in all publications whatsoever, or in public assemblies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924014118222 The constitution of the Czechoslovak Republic (1920)], ''Internet Archive'', [[Cornell University Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These rights were also provided for in article 57 of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1919]]: "The Czecho-Slovak State accepts and agrees to embody in a Treaty with the Principal Allied and Associated Powers such provision as may be deemed necessary by these Powers to protect the interests of inhabitants of that State who differ from the majority of the population in race, language or religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1920/3.html Text of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)], from the website of the [[Australasian Legal Information Institute]], hosted by [[University of New South Wales|UNSW]] and [[University of Technology, Sydney|UTS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

"In addition, the Language act granted minorities the right to address courts, offices and state organs in their own language, but only in communities where that national minority comprised more than 20 percent of the population."&lt;ref name="bakke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folk.uio.no/stveb1/Czechoslovak_constitutions.pdf|title=The principle of national self-determination in Czechoslovak  constitutions 1920–1992  |last=Bakke |first=Elisabeth |year=2002|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The proceedings in the parliament were held either in the official languages of Czechoslovakia, Czech and Slovak, or in one of the recognized minority languages. Practically, everyone spoke his own language.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. the [http://www.psp.cz/cgi-bin/eng/eknih/1935ns/ps/stenprot/001schuz/s001001.htm Opening of the 1935 session of the Czechoslovak Chamber of Deputies with every member taking the oath in his own language], ''[http://www.psp.cz/cgi-bin/eng/eknih/ Digitalized Archives of the Czechoslovak Parliament]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognized minorities in the Socialist Republic ==
A Government Council for Nationalities was established in 1968 in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic according to Article 5 of the Constitutional Law No. 144/1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vlada.cz/en/pracovni-a-poradni-organy-vlady/rnm/historie-a-soucasnost-rady-en-16666/ Government Council for National Minorities]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicts Between Czechs and Slovaks ==
{{Main article|Slovaks in Czechoslovakia (1918–38)|Slovaks in Czechoslovakia (1960–90)}}
[[Image:Masaryk kulaty.png|150px|left|thumb|Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]]
After the World War I, the Czechs outnumbered Slovaks two to one in the new Czechoslovak state.&lt;ref name='Krupnick'&gt;Charles Krupnick, [https://books.google.com/books?id=grPnsRWDqgIC Almost NATO: partners and players in Central and Eastern European security], Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The Slovaks lived in the shadow of the more internationally recognized Czech leadership and the great capital of Prague.&lt;ref name='Krupnick' /&gt; The relationship between the [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] was asymmetrical: [[Slovakia]] was considered an agrarian appendage to the highly industrial Czech nation,&lt;ref name='Krupnick' /&gt;&lt;ref name='everyculture'&gt;{{Cite web| last =  | first =  | last1 =  | first1 = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Culture of Czech Republic| publisher = www.everyculture.com| year =  | location =  | page =  | url = http://www.everyculture.com/Cr-Ga/Czech-Republic.html | doi =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Czechs viewed Slovak culture as lacking in maturity and refinement.&lt;ref name='everyculture' /&gt; The languages of the two nations are closely related and mutually intelligible, many Czechs viewed Slovak as a caricature of Czech.&lt;ref name='everyculture' /&gt;
In his 1934 memoirs, the President of Czechoslovakia, [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], writes he said in a 1924 interview to a French journalist of ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]'': «There is no Slovak nation, it has been invented by Hungarian propaganda. The Czechs and Slovaks are brothers. They understand each other perfectly. All that separates them is the cultural level - the Czechs are more developed than the Slovaks, because the Magyars kept them in the dark. (...) In one generation there will be no difference between the two branches of our national family.»&lt;ref&gt;Tomáš  G. Masaryk, ''Cesta demokracie II''  (The path of democracy), Prague, 134, p.78-79, full quotation translated in: Elisabeth Bakke, «[http://folk.uio.no/stveb1/Czechoslovakism_Loyalitaten.pdf The Making of Czechoslovakism in the First Czechoslovak Republic]», p.35 n22, in: Martin Schulze Wessel (ed.), ''Loyalitäten in der Tschechoslowakischen Republik 1918–1938. Politische, nationale und kulturelle Zugehörigkeiten'', Munich, R. Oldenbourg Verlag, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However the interview is nowhere to be found in the scanned full archives of Le Petit Parisien.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb34419111x/date1921.r=masaryk.langFR the scanned full archives of Le Petit Parisien]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Germans in Czechoslovakia ==
{{Main article|Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia}}
There were two German minorities in the interwar Czechoslovakian Republic, the [[Sudeten Germans]] in Bohemia and Moravia (present-day [[Czech republic]]) and the [[Carpathian Germans]] in [[Slovakia]] and [[Subcarpathian Ruthenia]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]).

In addition, there was a sizeable [[History of the Jews in Czechoslovakia|German-speaking urban Jewish minority]], and several Jewish politicians were elected as members of German minority parties like the [[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic]] or the [[German Democratic Liberal Party]].

== Hungarians in Czechoslovakia ==
{{Main article|Hungarians in Slovakia|Slovakization}}

Hungarians (and other minorities e.g. [[German people|Germans]] and [[Rusyns]]) were excluded from the constituent assembly, barring them from having any influence on the new Czechoslovak constitution.&lt;ref name="Zoch1_1"&gt;{{cite book

|accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later on, all the minorities gained the right to use their languages in municipalities where they constituted at least 20% of the population even in communication with government offices and courts. However due to [[gerrymandering]] and disproportionate distribution of population between [[Bohemia]] and [[Slovakia]] the Hungarians had little (if any) representation in the National Assembly and thus their influence on the politics of Czechoslovakia remained limited. The same considerations have limited the Slovak [[intelligentsia]]'s political power as well.&lt;ref name="Zoch1_1" /&gt;

==Jews in Czechoslovakia==
{{Main article|History of the Jews in Czechoslovakia}}
During communism there were no signs of organized [[Jewish]] life and the situation was similar to others communities of Central and Eastern Europe controlled directly by state.&lt;ref name='Hegedus'&gt;{{Cite web  |last1=Hegedus |first1=Martin |title=Jews in Slovakia |publisher=Slovakia.org |url=http://www.slovakia.org/society-jews.htm |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Jewish left the country for [[Israel]] or the [[United States]] who wanted to follow Jewish lives and freedom.&lt;ref name='Hegedus' /&gt; For many years there has been no religious leadership.&lt;ref name='Hegedus' /&gt;

==Roma in Czechoslovakia==
{{Main article|Roma in Czechoslovakia|Roma in Slovakia|Roma in the Czech Republic}}
After the World War I, the Roma people formed an ethnic community, living on the social periphery of the mainstream population.&lt;ref name='Orgovanova'&gt;{{Cite web |last=Orgovanova |first=Klara |title=Roma in Slovakia| publisher = Slovakia.org |url=http://www.slovakia.org/society-roma.htm |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state always focused on the Roma population not as a distinct ethnic minority, but rather perceived it as a particularly [[Anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] and [[criminal]] group.&lt;ref name='Orgovanova' /&gt; This attitude was reflected in the policy of collecting special police evidence—fingerprint collections of members of Romany groups (1925), a law about wandering Roma (1927).&lt;ref name='Orgovanova' /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
[[Racism]] was not an unknown phenomenon under [[communism]].&lt;ref name="Lawson" /&gt;  Roma people were forced to resettle in small groups around the country left them isolated.&lt;ref name="Lawson" /&gt; This policy of the state was oriented toward one of assimilation of the Roma people (in 1958, Law No. 74, "On the permanent settlement of nomadic and semi-nomadic people"), forcibly limited the movement of that part of the Roma (perhaps 5%-10%) who still traveled on a regular basis.&lt;ref name='Orgovanova' /&gt; In the same year, the highest organ of the [[Communist]] Party of [[Czechoslovakia]] passed a resolution, the aim of which was to be "the final assimilation of the Gypsy population". The "Gypsy question" was decreased to a "problem of a socially-backward section of the population".&lt;ref name='Orgovanova' /&gt; During this period, the governments actively supported [[Sterilisation (medicine)|sterilisation]] and [[abortion]] for Roma women and the policy was not repealed until 1991.&lt;ref name="Lawson" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The popular perception of [[Romani people|Romani]] even before 1989 was of lazy, dirty criminals who abused social services and posed a significant threat to majority values.&lt;ref name="Lawson"&gt;George Lawson, Economic and Social Research Council (Great Britain), Negotiated revolutions: the Czech Republic, South Africa and Chile, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2005, p. 115 {{ISBN|978-0-754-64327-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rusyns in Czechoslovakia==
{{Main article|Ruthenians and Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)}}
After the World War II, the [[Rusyns|Rusyn]] nationality was declared to be [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name='Custer'&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Custer |first1=Richard D. |title = What is a Rusyn? |publisher=Slovakia.org |url=http://www.slovakia.org/society-rusyn.htm |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rusyns refused Ukrainian identity, instead declaring their nationality as Slovak.&lt;ref name='Custer' /&gt; Rusyn cultural institutions were changed to Ukrainian, and the usage of the Rusyn language in official communications ceased.&lt;ref name='Custer' /&gt; Most settlement had only a Slovak-language school and a Slovak identity and orientation were adopted by most of the Rusyn populace, and they were, in effect, de-nationalized.&lt;ref name='Custer' /&gt;

The '''European Union Emissions Trading System''' ('''EU ETS'''), also known as the ''European Union Emissions Trading Scheme'', was the first large greenhouse gas [[emissions trading]] scheme in the world, and remains the biggest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ellerman, A. |first=Denny |last2=Buchner |first2= Barbara K.

Under the 'cap and trade' principle, a maximum (cap) is set on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted by all participating installations. "Allowances" for emissions are then auctioned off or allocated for free, and can subsequently be traded. Installations must [[Carbon monitoring|monitor]] and report their CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, ensuring they hand in enough allowances to the authorities to cover their emissions. If emission exceeds what is permitted by its allowances, an installation must purchase allowances from others. Conversely, if an installation has performed well at reducing its emissions, it can sell its leftover credits. This allows the system to find the most cost-effective ways of reducing emissions without significant government intervention.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The scheme has been divided into a number of "trading periods". The first ETS trading period lasted three years, from January 2005 to December 2007. The second trading period ran from January 2008 until December 2012, coinciding with the first commitment period of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. The third trading period began in January 2013 and will span until December 2020. Compared to 2005, when the EU ETS was first implemented, the proposed caps for 2020 represents a 21% reduction of greenhouse gases. This target has been reached six years early as emissions in the ETS fell to 1812 mln tonnes in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentalistonline.com/article/2015-04-07/ets-emissions-decline-sharply|title=Transform -|author=|date=|website=www.environmentalistonline.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU ETS has seen a number of significant changes, with the first trading period described as a 'learning by doing' phase.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/faq_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, since its conception, the EU ETS has been characterized by relatively high levels of policy uncertainty.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teeter|first=Preston|last2=Sandberg|first2=Jorgen|date=2016|title=Constraining or Enabling Green Capability Development? How Policy Uncertainty Affects Organizational Responses to Flexible Environmental Regulations|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8551.12188/full|journal=British Journal of Management|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1111/1467-8551.12188|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This uncertainty has been both technical, in terms of its detailed rules and procedures, and political, in terms of its public, industry, and governmental support. As a result, the scheme has resulted in a rather informal and tepid response by regulated organizations.

== Mechanisms ==
The first phase of EU ETS was created to operate apart from international climate change treaties such as the pre-existing [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC, 1992) or the [[Kyoto Protocol]] that was subsequently (1997) established under it. When the Kyoto Protocol came into force on 16 February 2005, Phase I of the EU ETS had already become operational. The EU later agreed to incorporate Kyoto flexible mechanism certificates as compliance tools within the EU ETS. The "Linking Directive" allows operators to use a certain amount of Kyoto certificates from flexible mechanism projects in order to cover their emissions.

The Kyoto flexible mechanisms are:
* [[Joint Implementation]] projects (JI) defined by Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol, which produce [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s (ERUs). One ERU represents the successful emissions reduction equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (t{{CO2}}e).
* the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) defined by Article 12, which produces [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s (CERs).  One CER represents the successful emissions reduction equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (t{{CO2}}e).
* International Emissions Trading (IET) defined by Article 17.

IET is relevant as the reductions achieved through CDM projects are a compliance tool for EU ETS operators. These Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) can be obtained by implementing emission reduction projects in developing countries, outside the EU, that have ratified (or acceded to) the Kyoto Protocol. The implementation of Clean Development Projects is largely specified by the [[Marrakech Accords]], a follow-on set of agreements by the Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.
The legislators of the EU ETS drew up the scheme independently but called on the experiences gained during the running of the voluntary [[UK Emissions Trading Scheme]] in the previous years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/change_energy/tackling_clima/ccas/uk_ets/uk_ets.aspx UK Emissions Trading Scheme] DECC&lt;/ref&gt; and collaborated with other parties to ensure its units and mechanisms were compatible with the design agreed through the UNFCCC.

Under the EU ETS, the governments of the EU Member States agree on national emission caps which have to be approved by the EU commission. Those countries then allocate allowances to their industrial operators, and track and validate the actual emissions in accordance with the relevant assigned amount. They require the allowances to be retired after the end of each year.

The operators within the ETS may reassign or trade their allowances by several means:
* privately, moving allowances between operators within a company and across national borders
* [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter]], using a [[broker]] to privately match buyers and sellers
* trading on the [[spot market]] of one of Europe's climate exchanges

Like any other [[financial instrument]], trading consists of matching buyers and sellers between members of the exchange and then settling by depositing a valid allowance in exchange for the agreed financial consideration. Much like a [[stock market]], companies and private individuals can trade through brokers who are listed on the exchange, and need not be regulated operators.

When each change of ownership of an allowance is proposed, the [[Emissions Trading Registry|national registry]] and the European Commission are informed in order for them to validate the transaction. During Phase II of the EU ETS, the [[UNFCCC]] also validates the allowance and any change that alters the distribution within each national allocation plan.

Like the Kyoto trading scheme, EU ETS allows a regulated operator to use [[carbon credit]]s in the form of Emission Reduction Units (ERU) to comply with its obligations. A Kyoto [[Certified Emission Reduction]] unit (CER), produced by a [[carbon project]] that has been certified by the UNFCCC's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] Executive Board, or Emission Reduction Unit (ERU) certified by the [[Joint Implementation]] project's host country or by the Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee, are accepted by the EU as equivalent.

Thus one [[EU Allowance]] Unit of one tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or "EUA", was designed to be identical ("[[fungible]]") with the equivalent "[[Assigned amount units|Assigned Amount Unit]]" (AAU) of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; defined under Kyoto. Hence, because of the EU's decision to accept Kyoto-CERs as equivalent to EU-EUA's, it is possible to trade EUA's and UNFCCC-validated CERs on a one-to-one basis within the same system. (However, the EU was not able to link trades from all its countries until 2008-9 because of its technical problems connecting to the UN systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbon-financeonline.com/index.cfm?section=lead&amp;action=view&amp;id=10948&amp;linkref=cnews ITL link, EU ETS review key for 2008 prices. Carbon Finance 9 January 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201716/http://www.carbon-financeonline.com/index.cfm?section=lead&amp;action=view&amp;id=10948&amp;linkref=cnews |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

During Phase II of the EU ETS, the operators within each Member State must surrender their allowances for inspection by the EU before they can be "retired" by the UNFCCC.

===Allocation===
The total number of permits issued (either auctioned or allocated) determines the supply for the allowances. The actual price is determined by the market. Too many allowances compared to demand will result in a low carbon price, and reduced emission abatement efforts.&lt;ref name=newbery&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each EU ETS Phase, the total quantity to be allocated by each Member State is defined in the National Allocation Plan (equivalent to its UNFCCC-defined carbon account.) The European Commission has oversight of the NAP process and decides if the NAP fulfills the twelve criteria set out in the Annex&amp;nbsp;III of the Emission Trading Directive (EU Directive 2003/87/EC). The first and foremost criterion is that the proposed total quantity is in line with a Member State's Kyoto target.

Of course, the Member State's plan can, and should, also take account of emission levels in other sectors not covered by the EU ETS, and address these within its own domestic policies. For instance, transport is responsible for 21% of EU greenhouse gas emissions, households, and small businesses for 17% and agriculture for 10%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/pdf/m06_452_en.pdf Questions and Answers on Emissions Trading and National Allocation Plans for 2008 to 2012] EU November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

During Phase&amp;nbsp;I, most allowances in all countries were given freely (known as [[grandfather clause|grandfathering]]). This approach has been criticized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

To address these problems,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} the European Commission proposed various changes in a January 2008 package, including the abolishment of NAPs from 2013 and auctioning a far greater share (ca. 60% in 2013, growing afterward) of emission permits.

From the start of Phase III (January 2013) there will be a centralised allocation of permits, not National Allocation Plans, with a greater share of auctioning of permits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/796 Question and Answer on the revised EU ETS] EUROPA, Brussels 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competitiveness===
Allocation can act as a means of addressing concerns over loss of [[competitiveness]], and possible "leakage" ([[carbon leakage]]) of emissions outside the EU. Leakage is the effect of emissions increasing in countries or sectors that have weaker regulation of emissions than the regulation in another country or sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Correcting for leakage by allocating permits acts as a temporary [[subsidy]] for affected industries, but does not fix the underlying problem. Border adjustments would be the economically efficient choice, where imports are taxed according to their carbon content.&lt;ref name=newbery/&gt;&lt;ref name=neuhoff/&gt; One problem with border adjustments is that they might be used as a disguise for trade [[protectionism]].&lt;ref name=grubb&gt;{{Cite web

===Banking and borrowing===
Within a certain trading period, banking and borrowing is allowed. For example, a 2006 EUA can be used in 2007 (banking) or in 2005 (borrowing). Interperiod borrowing is not allowed. Member states had the discretion to decide whether banking EUAs from Phase I to Phase II was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mit.edu/mitei/research/spotlights/europe-carbon.html |title= Carbon emissions trading in Europe: Lessons to be learned |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy Initiative |author=Nancy Stauffer |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=25 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phase I==
In the first phase (2005–2007), the EU ETS included some 12,000 installations, representing approximately 40% of EU CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, covering energy activities (combustion installations with a rated thermal input exceeding 20&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]], mineral oil refineries, coke ovens), production and processing of ferrous metals, mineral industry (cement clinker, glass and ceramic bricks) and pulp, paper and board activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4114921.stm |title=Q&amp;A: Europe's carbon trading scheme |work=BBC News  |date=20 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Launch and operation===
The ETS, in which all 15 Member States that were then members of the [[European Union]] participated, nominally commenced operation on 1&amp;nbsp;January 2005, although national registries were unable to settle transactions for the first few months. However, the prior existence of the [[UK Emissions Trading Scheme]] meant that market participants were already in place and ready. In its first year, 362&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] were traded on the market for a sum of €7.2&amp;nbsp;billion, and a large number of futures and options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pointcarbon.com/wimages/Carbon_2006_final_print.pdf |title=Carbon 2006 market survey |publisher= Point Carbon |date=28 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prices===
The price of allowances increased more or less steadily to a peak level in April 2006 of about €30 per tonne CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emissierechten.nl/marktanalyse.htm |title=Analyse van de CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-markt (in Dutch) |publisher=Emissierechten |date=November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411145740/http://www.emissierechten.nl/marktanalyse.htm |archivedate=11 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late April 2006, a number of EU countries (the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Belgium, France, and Spain) announced that their verified (or actual) emissions were less than the number of allowances allocated to installations. The spot price for [[EU allowance]]s dropped 54% from €29.20 to €13.35 in the last week of April 2006. In May 2006, the European Commission confirmed that verified CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions were about 80 million tonnes or 4% lower than the number of allowances distributed to installations for 2005 emissions.&lt;ref name="ellerman"&gt;{{cite journal

Lack of scarcity under the first phase of the system continued through 2006 resulting in a trading price of €1.2&amp;nbsp;per tonne in March 2007, declining to €0.10 in September 2007. In 2007, carbon prices for the trial phase dropped to near zero for most of the year.

===Verified emissions===
Verified emissions show a net increase over the first phase of the scheme. For the countries for which data was available, emissions increased by 1.9% between 2005 and 2007 (at the time all 27 member states minus [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Malta]]).

&lt;/small&gt;

Consequently, observers have accused national governments of [[abusing the system]] under industry pressure, and have urged for far stricter caps in the second phase (2008–2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emissierechten.nl/marktanalyse.htm Emissierechten] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411145740/http://www.emissierechten.nl/marktanalyse.htm |date=11 April 2013 }} (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phase II==

===Scope===
The second phase (2008–12) expanded the scope of the scheme significantly. In 2007, three non-EU members, [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], and [[Liechtenstein]] joined the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eubusiness.com/topics/environ/1193418125.05 |title=Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein to join EU emissions trading system  |publisher=EUbusiness Ltd |author=AFP |date=27 October 2007 |accessdate=28 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EU's "Linking Directive" introduced the [[Clean Development Mechanism|CDM]] and [[Joint Implementation|JI]] credits. Although this was a theoretical possibility in phase I, the over-allocation of permits combined with the inability to bank them for use in the second phase meant it was not taken up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 27 April 2012, the European Commission announced the full activation of the EU Emissions Trading System single registry.  The full activation process will include the migration of over 30,000 EU ETS accounts from national registries. The EC has further stated that the single registry to be activated in June will not contain all the required functionalities for phase III of the EU ETS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= EU Emissions Trading System Single Registry: Timetable Announced |url= http://www.natlawreview.com/article/eu-emissions-trading-system-single-registry-timetable-announced|publisher=[[McDermott Will &amp; Emery]] |work=The National Law Review|date=12 May 2012|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation emissions===
Aviation emissions were to be included from 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=European Commission: DG Climate Action
|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of aviation was estimated to increase in demand for allowances by about 10–12 million tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year in phase two. According to DEFRA, an increased use of JI credits from projects in Russia and [[Ukraine]], would offset any increase in prices so there would be no discernible impact on average annual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The airline industry and other countries including China, India, Russia, and the United States reacted adversely to the inclusion of the aviation sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States and other countries argued that the EU did not have jurisdiction to regulate flights when they were not in European skies; China and the United States threatened to ban their national carriers from complying with the scheme. On 27 November 2012 the United States enacted the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme Prohibition Act of 2011]] which prohibits U.S. carriers from participating in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme.&lt;ref name="Public Law 112–200 112th Congress"&gt;{{cite web|title=European Union Emissions Trading Scheme Prohibition Act of 2011|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-112publ200/pdf/PLAW-112publ200.pdf|publisher=Government Printing Office|accessdate=27 January 2012|date=27 November 2012|quote=An Act To prohibit operators of civil aircraft of the United States from participating in the European Union's emissions trading scheme, and for other purposes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT012613&gt;{{cite news|title=Your Biggest Carbon Sin May Be Air Travel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/sunday-review/the-biggest-carbon-sin-air-travel.html|accessdate=27 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 January 2013|author=Elisabeth Rosenthal}}&lt;/ref&gt; China threatened to withhold $60 billion in outstanding orders from Airbus, which in turn led to France pressuring the EU to freeze the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-airlines-climate/insight-u-s-china-turned-eu-powers-against-airline-pollution-law-idUSBRE8B801H20121210|title=Insight: U.S., China turned EU powers against airline pollution law|first=Barbara|last=Lewis|date=|website=reuters.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU insisted that the regulation should be applied equally to all carriers, and that it did not contravene international regulations. In the absence of a global agreement on airline emissions, the EU argued that it was forced to go ahead with its own scheme. But only flights within the EEA are covered; international flights are not.&lt;ref name="ec transport" /&gt;

=== Other ===

Ultimately, the Commission intended that the third trading period should cover all greenhouse gases and all sectors, including aviation, maritime transport, and forestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/05/712&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=Stavros Dimas Speech to House of Commons London |publisher=  EU Europa |date=21 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the transport sector, the large number of individual users adds complexities, but might be implemented either as a cap-and-trade system for fuel suppliers or a baseline-and-credit system for car manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Klooster, |first=Jeroen |last2=Kampman |first2= Bettina

The National Allocation Plans for Phase II, the first of which were announced on 29 November 2006, provided for an average reduction of nearly 7% below the 2005 emission levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/1650&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=Emissions trading: Commission decides on first set of national allocation plans for the 2008–2012 trading period 
|publisher=EU Europa |date=November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of offsets such as Emission Reduction Units from JI and Certified Emission Reductions from CDM projects was allowed, with the result that the EU would be able to meet the Phase II cap by importing units instead of reducing emissions (CCC, 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;145,&amp;nbsp;149).&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{cite book

According to verified EU data from 2008, the ETS resulted in an emissions reduction of 3%, or 50&amp;nbsp;million tons. At least 80&amp;nbsp;million tons of "[[carbon offset]]s" were bought for compliance with the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gilbertson |first= T. |last2=Reyes |first2=O |year=2009 |url=http://www.carbontradewatch.org/carbon-trade-fails |title=Carbon trading: how it works and why it fails |location= Uppsala |publisher= Dag Hammarskjöld Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2006, [[European Commission]] started infringement proceedings against Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Italy and Spain, for failure to submit their proposed National Allocation Plans on time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/comparl/envi/pdf/implementation/is20061127.pdf

The average price was €22/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the second half of 2008, and €13/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the first half of 2009.

*Reduced output in energy-intensive sectors as a result of the [[Late-2000s recession|recession]]. This means that less abatement will be required to meet the cap, lowering the carbon price.
*The market perception of future fossil fuel prices may have been revised downwards.

Projections made in 2009 indicate that like Phase&amp;nbsp;I, Phase&amp;nbsp;II would see a surplus in allowances and that 2009 carbon prices were being sustained by the need to 'bank' allowances in order to surrender them in the tougher third phase.&lt;ref name=grubb/&gt;  In December 2009, carbon prices dropped to a six-month low after the Copenhagen climate summit outcome disappointed traders. Prices for EU allowances for December 2010 delivery dropped 8.7% to 12.40 euros a tonne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In March 2012, according to the periodical ''Economist'', the EUA permit price under the EU ETS had "tanked" and was too low to provide incentives for firms to reduce emissions. The permit price had been persistently under €10 per tonne compared to nearly €30 per tonne in 2008. The market had been oversupplied with permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

For Phase III (2013–2020), the European Commission has proposed a number of changes, including (CCC, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;149):&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;
*the setting of an overall EU cap, with allowances then allocated to EU members;
*tighter limits on the use of offsets;
*limiting banking of allowances between Phases II and III;
*and a move from allowances to auctioning.

As well as more sectors and gases included in Phase III.  Also, millions of allowances set aside in the New Entrants Reserve(NER) to fund the deployment of innovative renewable energy technologies and carbon capture and storage through the NER 300 programme,one of the world's largest funding programmes for innovative low-carbon energy demonstration projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/index_en.htm|title=EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) - Climate Action - European Commission|first=|last=Anonymous|date=23 November 2016|website=Climate Action - European Commission|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The programme is conceived as a catalyst for the demonstration of environmentally safe carbon capture and storage (CCS) and innovative renewable energy (RES) technologies on a commercial scale within the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/lowcarbon/ner300/index_en.htm|title=NER 300 programme - Climate Action - European Commission|first=|last=Anonymous|date=23 November 2016|website=Climate Action - European Commission|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of its accession to the EU, Croatia joined the ETS at the start of Phase III on 1 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 4 January 2013, European Union allowances for 2013 traded on London's ICE Futures Europe exchange for between 6.22 euros and 6.40 euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Phase IV==
Phase IV will commence on 1 January 2021 and finish on 31 December 2028. The European Commission plans a full review of the Directive by 2026.

On 22 January 2014, the European Commission proposed two structural reform amendments to the ETS directive (2003/87/EC) of the 2008 Climate Package to be agreed on in the Council Conclusions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-council.europa.eu/council-meetings/conclusions?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; on 20–21 March 2014 by the Heads of EU Member States at the meeting of the European Council:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/140671.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* the linear reduction factor, at which the overall emissions cap is reduced, from 1.74% (2013–2020) to 2.2% each year from 2021 to 2030, thus reducing EU CO2 emissions in the ETS sector by 43% compared to 2005&lt;ref&gt;A policy framework for climate and energy in the period from 2020 to 2030, page 5, http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/2030/docs/com_2014_15_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* the creation of a 12% "automatic set-aside" reserve mechanism of verified annual emissions (at least a 100 mln CO2 permit reserve) in the fourth ETS period from 2021 to 2030, thus creating a quasi [[carbon tax]] or ''carbon price floor'' with a price range set each year by the European Commission's Directorate General for Climate Change&lt;ref&gt;COM(2014) 20x/2 Proposal for a DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL concerning the establishment and operation of a market stability reserve for the Union greenhouse gas emission trading scheme and amending Directive 2003/87/EC, http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/reform/docs/com_2014_20_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Connie Hedegaard, the EU Commissioner for Climate Change, hoped "to link up the ETS with compatible systems around the world to form the backbone of a global carbon market" with Australia cited as an example.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt; However, as the COP 19 Climate Conference again ended with no binding new international agreement in 2013, Australia has dismantled its ETS system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climatechange.gov.au/carbon-tax-abolished-1-july-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the European Council summit on 20 March 2014,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.consilium.europa.eu/homepage/highlights/council-focuses-on-climate,-energy-and-gmos?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; the European Commission decided to propose a change in the functioning of the carbon market (CO2 permits). The submitted legislation on the Market Stability Reserve system (MSR) would change the amount of annually auctioned CO2 permits based on the amount of CO2 permits in circulation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipex.eu/IPEXL-WEB/dossier/document.do?code=COM&amp;year=2014&amp;number=20&amp;extension=null&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October 2014, at the meeting of the European Council, the Heads of Governments of EU Member States provided legal certainty to the proposed Market Stability Reserve (MSR) by sanctioning the political project in the text of the Council Conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-169-2014-INIT/en/pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This would address imbalances in supply and demand in the European carbon market by adjusting volumes for auction. The reserve would operate on predefined rules with no discretion for the Commission or Member States.

The European Parliament and the European council informally agreed on an adapted version of this proposal, which sets the starting date of the MSR to 2019 (so already in Phase III), puts the 900 million backloaded allowances in the reserve and reduces the reaction time of the MSR to one year. This adapted proposal has already passed the European parliament and is to be approved by the Council of ministers in September 2015.&lt;ref name="europarl.europa.eu"/&gt;

==Costs==
Emissions in the EU have been reduced at costs that are significantly lower than projected,&lt;ref name=grubb/&gt; though transaction costs are related to economies of scale and can be significant for smaller installations.&lt;ref&gt;Heindl, Peter: [http://www.zew.de/en/publikationen/publikation.php3?action=detail&amp;nr=6532 Transaction Costs and Tradable Permits: Empirical Evidence from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme]. Discussion Paper No. 12-021. Centre for European Economic Research, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the estimated cost was a fraction of 1% of [[GDP]]. It was suggested that if permits were auctioned, and the revenues used effectively, e.g., to reduce [[distortion (economics)|distortionary]] taxes and fund low-carbon technologies, costs could be eliminated, or even create a positive economic impact.

==Overall emission reductions==
According to the European Commission, in 2010 greenhouse gas emissions from big emitters covered by the EU ETS had decreased by an average of more than 17,000 tonnes per installation from 2005, a decrease of more than 8% since 2005.

|publisher= European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[UBS]] Investment Research, the EU ETS cost $287 billion through to 2011 and had an "almost zero impact" on the volume of overall emissions in the European Union and the money could have resulted in more than a 40% reduction in emissions if it had been used in a targeted way, e.g., to upgrade power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/europes-287bn-carbon-waste-ubs-report/story-fn59niix-1226203068972 |title=Europe's $287bn carbon 'waste': UBS report |work=The Australian |first=Sid |last=Maher |date=23 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128113617/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/europes-287bn-carbon-waste-ubs-report/story-fn59niix-1226203068972 |archivedate=28 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusion of sinks==
Currently, the EU does not allow CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; credits under ETS to be obtained from [[carbon dioxide sink|sinks]] (e.g. reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by planting trees). However, some governments and industry representatives lobby for their inclusion. The inclusion is currently opposed by NGOs as well as the EU commission itself, arguing that sinks are surrounded by too many scientific uncertainties over their permanence and that they have inferior long-term contribution to climate change compared to reducing emissions from industrial sources.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsten Macey, [http://www.climnet.org/hotspot/Hotspot%2041.pdf No Sinks in the EU ETS], Hotspot newsletter 41, Climate Action Network, March 2006, retrieved 4 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==ETS related crime==

===Cybercrime===
On 19&amp;nbsp;January 2011, the EU emissions spot market for pollution permits was closed after computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]s stole 28 to 30&amp;nbsp;million euros ($41.12&amp;nbsp;million) worth of emissions allowances from the national registries of several European countries within a few days time period. The Czech Registry for Emissions Trading was especially hard hit with 7&amp;nbsp;million euros worth of allowances stolen by hackers from Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece, [[Estonia]], and Poland. A [[phishing]] scam is suspected to have enabled hackers to log into unsuspecting companies' carbon credit accounts and transfer the allowances to themselves, allowing them to then be sold.&lt;ref name="Carney"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703956604576109272255053468 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Sean | last=Carney | title=EU Carbon Market Suffers Further Setback | date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lehane"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://praguepost.com/business/7290-hackers-steal-carbon-credits.html

The European Commission said it would "proceed to determine together with national authorities what minimum security measures need to be put in place before the suspension of a registry can be lifted". Maria Kokkonen, EC spokeswoman for climate issues, said that national registries can be reopened once sufficient security measures have been enacted and member countries submit to the EC a report of their IT security protocol.

The Czech registry said there are still legal and administrative hurdles to be overcome and Jiri Stastny, chairman of OTE AS, the Czech registry operator, said that until there is recourse for victims of such theft, and a system is in place to return allowances to their rightful owners, the Czech registry will remain closed. Registry officials in Germany and Estonia have confirmed they have located 610,000 allowances stolen from the Czech registry, according to Mr. Stastny. Another 500,000 of the stolen Czech allowances are thought to be in accounts in the UK, according to the OTE.&lt;ref name="Carney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lehane"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFLDE70S0IY20110129 | agency=Reuters | title=Greek police trace EU carbon rights thieves | date=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyber fraudsters have also attacked the EU ETS with a "phishing" scam which cost one company €1.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/885/29403 Cyber-scam artists disrupt emissions trading across EU] EU Observer (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, the EU has revised the ETS rules to combat crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/en/climate-environment/eu-approves-revised-ets-rules-combat-cyber-crime-news-260461 EU approves revised ETS rules to combat cyber crime] Euractive (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The security breaches raised fears among some traders that they might have unknowingly purchased stolen allowances which they might later have to forfeit. The ETS experienced a previous phishing scam in 2010 which caused 13&amp;nbsp;European markets to shut down, and criminals cleared 5&amp;nbsp;million euros in another cross-border fraud in 2008 and 2009.&lt;ref name="lehane"/&gt;

===VAT fraud===
In 2009 [[Europol]] informed that 90% market volume of emissions traded in some countries could be result of tax fraud, more specifically [[missing trader fraud]], costing governments more than 5&amp;nbsp;billion euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://euobserver.com/885/29132 |title= EU emissions trading an 'open door' for crime, Europol says |publisher=EUobserver  |author=Leigh Phillips |date=10 December 2009|accessdate=28 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

German prosecutors confirmed in March 2011 that [[VAT|value-added-tax]] fraud in the trade of carbon-dioxide emissions has deprived the German state of about €850 million ($1.19&amp;nbsp;billion). In December 2011 a German court sentenced six people to jail terms of between three years and seven years and 10 months in a trial involving evasion of taxes on carbon permits. A French court sentenced five people to one to five years in jail, and to pay massive fines for evading tax through carbon trading. In the UK a first trial over VAT fraud in the carbon market is put on track to start in February 2012.

==Views on the EU ETS==
{{Tone|section|date=May 2010}}
{{criticism section|section|date=September 2014}}

Different people and organizations have responded differently to the EU ETS. Mr Anne Theo Seinen, of the EC's Directorate-General for the Environment, described Phase I as a "learning phase", where, for example, the infrastructure and institutions for the ETS were set up (UK Parliament, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Seinen also commented that the EU ETS needed to be supported by other policies for technology and renewable energy. According to CCC (2008, p.&amp;nbsp;155), technology policy is necessary to overcome [[market failure]]s associated with delivering low-carbon technologies, e.g., by supporting research and development.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;

A 2016 survey of German companies participating in the EU{{nbsp}}ETS found that the majority do not expect the EU{{nbsp}}ETS to be effective in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, not even in the long-run.

===Criticisms===
The EU ETS has been criticized&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbontradewatch.org/publications/carbon-trading-how-it-works-and-why-it-fails.html CARBON TRADING – HOW IT WORKS AND WHY IT FAILS] Carbon Trade Watch Critical Currents no. 7, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; for several failings, including: over-allocation, windfall profits, price volatility, and in general for failing to meet its goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporateeurope.org/climate-and-energy/content/2011/04/eu-ets-failing-third-attempt EU Emissions Trading System: Failing at the third attempt], Corporate Europe Observatory/Carbon Trade Watch, April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents argue, however, that Phase I of the EU ETS (2005–2007) was a "learning phase" designed primarily to establish baselines and create the infrastructure for a carbon market, not to achieve significant reductions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/mitei/research/spotlights/europe-carbon.html Carbon emissions trading in Europe: Lessons to be learned] MIT Energy Initiative, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ncseonline.org"&gt;[http://ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/08Mar/RL34150.pdf Climate Change and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS): Kyoto and Beyond] U.S. Congressional Research Service (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="c2es.org"&gt;[http://www.c2es.org/eu-ets The European Union's Emissions Trading System in Perspective] MIT/Pew Center 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the EU ETS has been criticized as having caused a disruptive spike in energy prices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/08/AR2007040800758_pf.html Europe’s Problems Color U.S. Plans to Curb Carbon Gases], Steven Mufson, The Washington Post, 9 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;   Defenders of the scheme say that this spike did not correlate with the price of permits, and in fact the largest price increase occurred at a time (Mar–Dec 2007) when the cost of permits was negligible.&lt;ref name="c2es.org"/&gt;

Researchers Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg have argued that it is largely the uncertainty behind the EU's scheme that has resulted in such a tepid and informal response by regulated organizations. Their research has revealed a similar outcome in Australia, where organizations saw little incentive to innovate and even comply with cap and trade regulations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Over-allocation===
There was an oversupply of emissions allowances for EU ETS Phase I. This drove the carbon price down to zero in 2007 (CCC, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;140).&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt; This oversupply reflects the difficulty in predicting future emissions which is necessary in setting a cap (Carbon Trust, 2009).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; Given poor data about emissions baselines, inherent uncertainty of emissions forecasts, and the very modest reduction goals of the Phase I cap (1–2% across the EU), it was entirely expected that{{According to whom|date=May 2010}} the cap might be set too high.&lt;ref name="c2es.org"/&gt;

This problem naturally diminishes as the cap tightens. The EU's Phase II cap is more than 6% below 2005 levels, much stronger than Phase I, and readily distinguishable from business-as-usual emissions levels.{{According to whom|date=May 2010}}&lt;ref name="c2es.org"/&gt;

Over-allocation does not imply that no abatement occurred. Even with over-allocation, there was theoretically a price on carbon (except for installations that received hundreds of thousands of free allowances). For some installations, the price had a some effect on emitters' behavior. Verified emissions in 2005 were 3–4% below projected emissions,&lt;ref name="ncseonline.org"/&gt; and analysis suggests that at least part of that reduction was due to the EU ETS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bepress.com/feem/paper90/ Over-Allocation or Abatement? A Preliminary Analysis of the EU ETS Based on the 2005 Emissions Data] Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei Working Papers (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012 Thomson Reuters Point Carbon calculated that the first Kyoto Protocol commitment period had been oversupplied by about 13 billion tonnes (13.1 Gt) of CO2 and that the second commitment period (2013-2020) was likely to start with a surplus of Assigned Amount Units (AAUs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

===Windfall profits===
According to Newbery (2009), the price of EUAs was included in the final price of electricity.&lt;ref name=newbery/&gt; The free allocation of permits was cashed in at the EUA price by fossil generators, resulting in a "massive windfall gain". Newbery (2009) wrote that "[there] is no case for repeating such a wilful misuse of the value of a common property resource that should be owned by the country". In the view of 4CMR (2009), all permits in the EU ETS should be auctioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would avoid possible windfall profits in all sectors.

===Price volatility===
The price of emissions permits tripled in the first six months of Phase I, collapsed by half in a one-week period in 2006, and declined to zero over the next twelve months. Such movements and the implied volatility raise questions about the viability of this trading system to provide stable incentives to emitters.&lt;ref name="c2es.org"/&gt;

This criticism has face validity. In future phases, measures such as banking of allowances and price floors may be used to mitigate volatility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/eprg/TSEC/2/betz.pdf Emissions trading: lessons learnt from the 1st phase of the EU ETS and prospects for the 2nd phase] Climate Policy (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it's important to note that considerable volatility is expected of this type of market, and the volatility seen is quite in line with that of energy commodities generally. Nonetheless, producers and consumers in those markets respond rationally and effectively to [[price signals]].&lt;ref name="c2es.org"/&gt;

Newbery (2009) commented that the EU ETS was not delivering the stable carbon price necessary for long-term, low-carbon investment decisions.&lt;ref name=newbery/&gt; He suggested that efforts should be made to stabilize carbon price, e.g., by having a [[price ceiling]] and a [[price floor]].

==Offsetting==

===Project based offsetting===
The EU ETS is 'linked' to the [[Joint Implementation]] and [[Clean Development Mechanism]] projects as it allows the limited use of 'offset credits' from them. Participating firms were allowed to use some [[Certified Emission Reduction]] units (CERs) from 2005 and [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s (ERUs) from 2008. Each Member State's National Allocation Plan must specify a percentage of the national allocation that will be the cap on the CERs and ERUs that may be used. CERs and ERUs from nuclear facilities and from [[Land use, land-use change, and forestry|Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry]] may not be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The main theoretical advantage of allowing free trading of credits is that it allows mitigation to be done at least-cost (CCC, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;160).&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt; This is because the [[margin (economics)|marginal]] costs (that is to say, the incremental costs of preventing the emission of one extra ton of [[carbon dioxide equivalent|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e]] into the atmosphere) of abatement differs among countries. In terms of the UK's climate change policy, CCC (2008), noted three arguments against too great a reliance on credits:

*Rich countries need to demonstrate that a low-carbon economy is possible and compatible with economic prosperity. This is in order to convince developing countries to lower their emissions. Additionally, domestic action by rich countries drives investment towards a low-carbon economy.
*An ambitious long-term target to reduce emissions, e.g., an 80%&amp;nbsp;cut in UK emissions by 2050, requires significant domestic progress by 2020 and 2030 to reduce emissions.
*CDM credits are inherently less robust than a cap and trade system, where reductions are required in total emissions.

Due to the economic downturn, states have pushed successfully for a more generous approach towards the use of CDM/JI credits post-2012.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlmann, 'The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme' (p.362), in Legal Aspects of Carbon Trading, Ed. Freestone (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Attribution needed|date=May 2010}} The 2009 EU ETS Amending Directive states that credits can be used for up to 50% of the EU-wide reductions below the 2005 levels of existing sectors over the period 2008–2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:140:0063:0087:en:PDF EU ETS Amending Directive 2009] EUROPA, p.78 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, it has been argued that the volume of CDM/JI credits, if carried over from phase II (2008–2012 to phase III 2013–2020) in the EU ETS will undermine its environmental effectiveness, despite the requirement of [[supplementarity]] in the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaieurope.net/ftp/project09/ETS_final.pdf The EU ETS, CDM and the Carbon Market] Mission of Thailand to the EC (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, the EU Climate Change Committee banned the use of [[Clean Development Mechanism|CDM]] [[Certified Emission Reduction]] units from HFC-23 destruction in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme from 1 May 2013. The ban includes nitrous oxide (N2O) from adipic acid production. The reasons given were the perverse incentives, the lack of additionality, the lack of environmental integrity,the under-mining of the Montreal Protocol, costs and ineffectiveness and the distorting effect of a few projects in advanced developing countries getting too many CERs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Buying and deleting emissions allowances===
As an alternative to CDM and JI projects, emissions can be offset directly by buying and deleting emissions allowances inside the ETS. This is a way to avoid several problems of CDM and JI such as additionality, measurement, leakage, permanence, and verification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/buying-and-cancelling-allowances-as-an-alternative-to-offsets-for-the-voluntary-market_5km975qmwp5c-en http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/buying-and-cancelling-allowances-as-an-alternative-to-offsets-for-the-voluntary-market_5km975qmwp5c-en] OECD Environment Working Papers, No. 21 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Buying and cancelling allowances allows to include more emissions sources in the ETS (such as traffic). Furthermore, it reduces the available allowances in the cap-and-trade system, which means that it reduces the emissions that can be produced by covered sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/trading/buying.html Buying Allowances] U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linking==

The EU is negotiating a link with Switzerland's domestic trading system.&lt;ref&gt;EU Commission DG Climate Change (2010): Opening negotiations with Switzerland on linking Emissions Trading Systems. http://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/articles/news_2010110501_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Distinct emissions trading systems can be linked through the recognition of emissions allowances for compliance. Linking&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. https://icapcarbonaction.com/about-emissions-trading/linking&lt;/ref&gt; systems creates a larger carbon market, which can reduce overall compliance costs, increase market liquidity and generate a more stable carbon market.&lt;ref&gt;Burtraw, D., Palmer, K. L., Munnings, C., Weber, P., &amp; Woerman, M., 2013: Linking by Degrees: Incremental Alignment of Cap-and-Trade Markets.

Climate Policy, 9(4), 358–372. doi:10.3763/cpol.2009.0626&lt;/ref&gt; Linking systems can also be politically symbolic as it shows willingness to undertake a common effort to reduce GHG emissions. Some scholars have argued that linking may provide a starting point for developing a new, bottom-up international climate policy architecture whereby multiple unique systems successively link their various systems.&lt;ref&gt;Ranson, M., &amp; Stavins, R., 2013: Linkage of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Systems - Learning from Experience.

[[Maryland Senate]] Bill 790, known as the '''Fair Share Health Care Act''', also nicknamed the ''"Wal-Mart Bill"'', was a legislative act passed in the state of [[Maryland]] in 2005. The act would have required for-profit employers with more than 10,000 workers in the state of Maryland to spend at least 8% of their payroll on employee health benefits or make a contribution to the state's insurance program for the poor. Non-profit employers were required to do the same, but with a lower, 6% benchmark.

The Maryland legislature initially passed the bill on April 5, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Md. Passes Rules on Wal-Mart Insurance |work=The Washington Post |date=April 6, 2005 |page=A01 |last= Wagner  |first=John; Barbaro, Michael |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28219-2005Apr5.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though its supporters contended that it did not single out [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]], Wal-Mart was the only private, for-profit employer in the state that would have been affected.&lt;ref name=heartland /&gt;

The bill was vetoed by then-Governor [[Robert L. Ehrlich]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Maryland first to OK 'Wal-Mart bill' |date=January 13, 2006 |work=USA Today |first=Stephanie |last=Armour |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2006-01-12-walmart-maryland_x.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 12, 2006, the Senate decided to override Ehrlich's veto, thereby passing the act into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Md. Legislature Overrides Veto on Wal-Mart Bill |work=The Washington Post |date=January 13, 2006 |first=John |last=Wagner |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/12/AR2006011201251.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=heartland&gt;{{cite web |title=Md.

On July 18, 2006, federal judge [[J. Frederick Motz]] struck down the law as preempted by [[ERISA]]. On January 17, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Appeals Court Rules for Wal-Mart in Maryland Health Care Case |first=Michael |last=Barbaro |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 18, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/18/business/18walmart.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar measures==
While the Maryland bill drew the most national media attention, similar measures were considered in other states but also failed.

In February 2006, a version of the bill that would have required companies with 5,000 or more employees to spend 9% of their payroll on health care benefits was defeated in [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wal-Mart bill likely dead; unions upset with Chopp |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=February 15, 2006  |first=Ralph |last=Thomas |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002806194_walmart15m.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426110936/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002806194_walmart15m.html |archivedate=April 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June of the same year, a similar bill was vetoed by the governor of [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/government/article/0,2777,DRMN_23906_4748013,00.html |title='Wal-Mart', after-school bills vetoed by Gov.

The '''Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia''' ({{lang-ka|აფხაზეთის ავტონომიური რესპუბლიკის მთავრობა|tr}}) is an administration recognized by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] as the legal and only government of [[Abkhazia]]. Abkhazia has been ''[[de facto]]'' independent of Georgia{{spaced ndash}}though with very little international recognition{{spaced ndash}}since the early 1990s. [[Vakhtang Kolbaia]], elected in April 2013, is the current head of the government-in-exile.

After the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|War in Abkhazia]] (1992–1993) Georgia proposed five-party talks involving the Government of the Autonomous Republic, the government of the ''[[de facto]]'' authorities of Abkhazia, and the government of Georgia, along with Russia and the UN as interested parties, in order to settle the final status of Abkhazia within the framework of the Georgian state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abkhazia-georgia.parliament.ge/Resolutions/Geores/1996_htm/apr_17.htm The Resolution of the Parliament of Georgia on the measures of conflict settlement in Abkhazia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930024356/http://www.abkhazia-georgia.parliament.ge/Resolutions/Geores/1996_htm/apr_17.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abkhaz side wanted assurances that Georgia would not try to solve the issue by force of arms before being a party to the talks.

Between September 2006 and July 2008, the Georgian recognized government was headquartered in [[Upper Abkhazia]]. However it was forced out of all of Abkhazia in August 2008 during the [[Russo-Georgian war]] by the [[Military of Abkhazia|Abkhazian armed forces]]. Upper Abkhazia is a territory that has population of c. 2,000 (1-1.5% of Abkhazia's post-war population) and is centered on the upper [[Kodori Valley]] (roughly 17% of the territory of the former [[Abkhaz ASSR]]). The government-in-exile is partly responsible for the affairs of some 250,000 [[internally displaced persons]] who were forced to leave Abkhazia following the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–93)|War in Abkhazia]] and the resulting [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|ethnic cleansing of Georgians]] from the area.&lt;ref&gt;Birgitte Refslund Sørensen, Marc Vincent (2001), ''Caught Between Borders: Response Strategies of the Internally Displaced'', pp. 234-5.

==History==
[[File:Scruj23.JPG|thumb|[[Sukhumi]], ''[[de jure]]'' capital of the Autonomous Republic of [[Abkhazia]].]]
During the War in Abkhazia, the Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia, then called the "'''Council of Ministers of Abkhazia'''", left Abkhazia after the Abkhaz separatist forces took control of the region’s capital [[Sukhumi]] after heavy fighting on September 27, 1993, leading to the [[Sukhumi Massacre]], in which several members of the Abkhazian government of that time, including its chairman [[Zhiuli Shartava]], were executed by the rebels. The Council of Ministers relocated to Georgia’s capital [[Tbilisi]], where it operated as the Government of Abkhazia in exile for almost 13 years. During this period, the Government of Abkhazia in exile, led by [[Tamaz Nadareishvili]], was known for a hard-line stance towards the Abkhaz problem and frequently voiced their opinion that the solution to the conflict can only be attained through Georgia's military response to secessionism. Later, Nadareishvili's administration was implicated in some internal controversies and had not taken an active part in the politics of Abkhazia until a new chairman, [[Irakli Alasania]], was appointed by [[President of Georgia]], [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], his envoy in the peace talks over Abkhazia.

Amid the [[2006 Kodori crisis|2006 Georgian police operation]] in Abkhazia's [[Kodori Gorge]], in which a local militia, led by the defiant [[warlord]] [[Emzar Kvitsiani]], had been largely disarmed, and the constitutional order restored in the area, President Saakashvili announced, on July 27, 2006, that the authorities had decided to establish the Tbilisi-based Abkhazian government-in-exile in the Kodori Gorge (Upper Abkhazia):

{{quotation|This decision means that for the first time since 1993 the government enters into the midst of Abkhazia, of our Abkhazia, to exercise Georgian jurisdiction and the Georgian constitutional order. This is very important fact and very fundamental political event.&lt;ref name="civil20060727"&gt;[http://207.44.135.100/eng/article.php?id=13197 Tbilisi-Based Abkhaz Government Moves to Kodori], ''Civil Georgia'', July 27, 2006. URL accessed on July 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 2008 [[Russo-Georgian War]], the Republic of Abkhazia joined forces with the Ossetians and opened a second front against Georgia. During the [[Battle of the Kodori Valley]] Abkhazian forces loyal to the [[Government of the Republic of Abkhazia]] pushed the Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia out of the region of Abkhazia. [[Sergei Bagapsh]], President of the [[Government of the Republic of Abkhazia]] said in an address to the [[Abkhazians|Abkhazian people]] that “the jurisdiction of the Abkhaz state has been restored in the upper Kodori Gorge.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?id=n149183 Sergei Bagapsh announces restoration of control over Kodori Gorge]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Herstigte Nasionale Party''' (Reconstituted National Party) is a [[List of political parties in South Africa|South African political party]] which was formed as a far-right splinter group of the now defunct [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] in 1969. The party name was commonly abbreviated as HNP, although colloquially they were also known as the Herstigtes.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Branford, ''A Dictionary of South African English'', Oxford University Press, 1978, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The HNP was formed in 1969 by [[Albert Hertzog]] (son of former Prime Minister General [[James Barry Munnik Hertzog|JBM Hertzog]]) in protest against the decision by Prime Minister [[B. J. Vorster|B.J. Vorster]] to authorize the presence of [[Māori people|Maori]] players and spectators during the tour of [[New Zealand rugby union team]] in South Africa in 1970. He was also against Vorster's re-establishment of diplomatic relations with [[Malawi]] and that country's appointment of a Black ambassador to South Africa.&lt;ref name="Brotz45"&gt;Howard Brotz, ''The Politics of South Africa: Democracy and Racial Diversity'', Oxford University Press, 1977, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; The name was chosen to reflect the initials of the earlier [[Herenigde Nasionale Party]] (Reunited National Party), the name used by the National Party in the [[South African general election, 1948|election of 1948]]. Seeking a return to [[Calvinism]] as the basis of South Africa, the party advocated complete [[racial segregation]] and the adoption of [[Afrikaans]] as the only official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the membership of the new party was made up of rural and small town working and lower middle class Afrikaners who resented what they saw as the National Party devoting their attentions to the concerns of urban Afrikaner elites.&lt;ref name="Brotz45"/&gt;The [[Afrikaner Broederbond]] denied membership to any HNP member.

The party contested the [[South African general election, 1970|1970 general election]] although its campaign was the subject of government crackdowns and attacks. The party's 78 candidates were all defeated, including its four Members of Parliament, all of whom had been National Party members before defecting to the new HNP.&lt;ref&gt;Brotz, ''Politics of South Africa'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The party also contested 50 seats in the [[South African general election, 1974|1974 general election]] but failed to make an impact in an election where reformists advanced.&lt;ref&gt;A.W. Stadler, 'The 1974 General Election in South Africa', ''African Affairs'', Vol. 74, No. 295. (April 1975), pp. 209–218&lt;/ref&gt; During this election the HNP boycotted the English language press, as the party opposed the use of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Brotz, ''Politics of South Africa'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; It also contested three by-elections in 1975 and 1976 and enjoyed some growth, taking second place ahead of the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] in the two seats that that group contested.&lt;ref&gt;Brotz, ''Politics of South Africa'', pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; The HNP captured 3.3% of the vote in the [[South African general election, 1977|1977 general election]] before increasing to 14.1% in [[South African general election, 1981|1981]] as right wing disenchantment with the NP grew, but on no occasion did it win any seats&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/za.html Elections in South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; and its newly acquired voters soon shifted their support to the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]].

[[Eugène Terre'Blanche]] had been a member of the HNP, but broke with the group in 1973, after becoming disillusioned with their adherence to electoral politics. He then established the paramilitary [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Link language|af}} [http://www.nuus24.com/Suid-Afrika/Nuus/Eugene-TerreBlanche-%281941-%E2%80%93-2010%29-20100404 Eugene Terre'Blanche (1941–2010)]. Retrieved 4 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He also differed from the HNP in his belief in the establishment of a white homeland in South Africa, something the HNP rejected as unnecessary.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;Carole Cooper, Jennifer Shindler, Colleen McCaul, Frances Potter, Melanie Cullum, Monty Narsoo, Pierre Brouard, ''Race Relations Survey 1985'', Johannesburg: South African Institute of Race Relations, 1986, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence in the 1980s==
Under the leadership of [[Jaap Marais]], the former deputy leader who replaced the retiring Hertzog in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;du Toit, op cit, p. 638&lt;/ref&gt; the party emerged as a force amongst white South Africans. In 1979 the evidence of its potential was demonstrated in a series of by-elections when it seemed to threaten the position of the ruling party.&lt;ref&gt;M. Meredith, ''In the Name of Apartheid'', London: Hamish Hamilton, 1988, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Despite obtaining 14.1% support in the [[South African general election, 1981|1981 general election]], the HNP never managed to gain seats in the South African parliament in a general election&lt;ref&gt;du Toit, op cit, p. 639&lt;/ref&gt; and remained only a voice of external opposition. However in October 1985 the party's general secretary Louis Stofberg won a by-election in [[Sasolburg]] on a campaign based on the presence of a mixed couple in the constituency and claims that the white population paid more tax than the other ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper et al, ''Race Relations Survey 1985'', pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; The victory came despite a breakdown in the electoral alliance between the HNP and the Conservative Party that had been established earlier that year, with [[Andries Treurnicht]] claiming it was a first step to merging the HNP into the Conservatives, something that Marais did not want.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;

The HNP effectively became the chief voice of the far-right, particularly in 1989 when both the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] and the [[Boerestaat Party]] declared their support for Marais.&lt;ref&gt;de Toit, op cit, p. 646&lt;/ref&gt; The group's only previous contact with other parties had been in 1985 when it briefly co-operated with the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]] to oppose the repeal of the [[Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act]] and the [[Immorality Amendment Act]] by [[P.W. Botha]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Omond, ''The Apartheid Handbook'', Penguin, 1985, pp. 26–7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Network with other organisations===
On the international stage, the HNP built up a number of contacts with far-right groups in Europe and for a time during the 1980s it was responsible for funding the United Kingdom-based [[League of Saint George]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Hill &amp; A. Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', London: Grafton, 1988, pp. 255–6&lt;/ref&gt; It was also closely associated with the [[South African National Front]] (SANF), an overseas branch of the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, op cit, pp. 52–73&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1980 and 1987 the party bankrolled the English-speaking far-right journal ''South African Patriot'', edited by SANF members John Hiddleston and then Alan Harvey.

==Post-Apartheid==
The HNP joined the [[Afrikanervolksfront|Afrikaner Volksfront]] of General [[Constand Viljoen]] in 1991, but the front collapsed in 1994 when many of the members refused to participate in South Africa's first multi-racial elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photius.com/countries/south_africa/government/south_africa_government_freedom_front.html 'South Africa Freedom Front']&lt;/ref&gt; The HNP drifted away from Viljoen and did not join his [[Freedom Front Plus|Freedom Front]] party. As a result, it has become something of a marginal force in contemporary South Africa, arguing for the self-determination of white [[Afrikaner]]s and a return to Verwoerdian apartheid. The party motto is now "Dié Land is ons Land" (This land is our land).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

It re-emerged in 2004, when the party lodged an official complaint against [[SABC 3]] when it broadcast a play entitled ''ID'' which satirised the killing of [[Hendrik Verwoerd]]. Although the HNP argued that it portrayed Verwoerd and his supporters unfairly, the complaint was rejected by the [[Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bccsa.co.za/images/hearings/JUDGMENTS%202004/PDF%20FILES%20JUDGMENT%20CATEGORIES/SABC3/Case%20No%20-%2042-2004.pdf Herstigte Nasionale Party v SABC 3, Case 42 of 2004]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jaap Marais]] died in 2000, and was replaced as leader by [[Willie Marais]]. Willie Marais died in December 2007, and was replaced as by Japie Theart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hnp.org.za/site/index.php?id=38 |title=Party site |access-date=12 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716051949/http://www.hnp.org.za/site/index.php?id=38 |archive-date=16 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The present leader is Andries Breytenbach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hnp.org.za/site/index.php?id=29 Die HNP se leiers]&lt;/ref&gt; Two splits have occurred from the party over ideology and tactics: the Afrikaner Nationalist Movement in 2004, and the Afrikaner Volksparty in 2008.

==Ideology==
When founded, the HNP emphasised above all its [[Afrikaner]] identity, attacking immigration, seeking to downgrade the importance of the English language, and endorsing apartheid. The party also launched an attack on the materialism that it felt was taking over South African society and thus sought to present itself as the voice of working class Afrikaners.&lt;ref&gt;M. Meredith, ''In the Name of Apartheid'', London: Hamish Hamilton, 1988, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; It frequently attacked the "liberalism" of the National Party regime, arguing that it was gradually diluting apartheid and offering too many concessions to non-whites.&lt;ref&gt;Brotz, ''Politics of South Africa'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The party reject the concept of a [[Volkstaat]], claiming all of South Africa for the Afrikaner instead. It believes that the interests of the black population will be sufficiently met in the former [[Bantustan|homelands]]. The HNP have no clear plan as to how the return to [[Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd|Verwoerdian]] South Africa could be achieved. The party also emphasises the importance of [[Calvinism]] to the South African identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hnp.org.za/afrikaans.html 'Waarvoor die HNP staan']&lt;/ref&gt;

The party does not recognise the new order in South Africa, and as a result, encourages people not to vote as part of its policy of resistance. However, this also makes it impossible to determine the exact support levels the party enjoys.

==Namibia==
While South Africa administered [[Namibia]] until 1988, the party was active in the country in opposition to independence and black rights. It contested the [[South-West African legislative election, 1978|first multi-ethnic election in 1978]], capturing 1.8% of the vote, or 10% of the White vote. The election resulted in a landslide win for the [[Democratic Turnhalle Alliance of Namibia]], albeit with the main black opposition parties, the [[South West Africa People's Organization]] and the [[Namibia National Front]], excluded from the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/na.html 'Elections in Namibia']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8363">'''Joseon diplomacy''' was the foreign policy of Joseon Dynasty of Korea from 1392 through 1910; and its theoretical and functional foundations were rooted in [[Neo-Confucian]] [[scholar-bureaucrats]], institutions and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, Jae-eun ''et al.'' (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=iB8R0oEH3kEC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=  ''The Land of Scholars,'' p. 172.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This long-term, strategic policy of ''[[sadae]]'' diplomacy (serving the great)  characterized the Joseon-Chinese relations in this period.  This contrasts with Joseon's ''[[gyorin]]'' diplomacy (neighborly relations) in its relations with Japan and others.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, Etsuko H. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=4f0jnNzdRb4C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=  ''Diplomacy and Ideology in Japanese-Korean Relations: from the Fifteenth to the Eighteenth Century,'' p. 49.]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, envoys from the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]] were received by [[Taejo of Joseon]] in 1392, 1394 and 1397.  [[Siam]] sent an envoy to Taejo's court in 1393.&lt;ref name="goodrich1601"&gt;[[Luther Carrington Goodrich|Goodrich, L. Carrington]]. (1976). [https://books.google.com/books?id=JWpF-dObxW8C&amp;lpg=PA1193&amp;vq=ryukyu&amp;dq=luther%20carrington%20goodrich&amp;pg=PA1601#v=snippet&amp;q=liu-ch'iu&amp;f=false  ''Dictionary of Ming biography, 1368-1644'' (明代名人傳), Vol. II, p. 1601.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taejo of Joseon]] established the "Kingdom of Great Joseon" in 1392-1393, and he founded the [[Joseon Dynasty]] which would retain power on the Korean peninsula for five hundred years. As an initial step, a diplomatic mission was dispatched to China and to Japan in 1402.  Subsequent missions developed and nurtured the contacts and exchanges between these neighboring countries.

A diplomatic mission conventionally consisted of three envoys—the main envoy, the vice-envoy, and a document official. Also included were one or more official writers or recorders who created a detailed account of the mission.&lt;ref&gt;Walraven, Boudewign ''et al.'' (2007). ''Korea in the middle: Korean studies and area studies,'' p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the Joseon Dynasty's bilateral relations were affected by the increasing numbers of international contacts which required adaptation and a new kind of diplomacy.&lt;ref name="kang38-78"&gt;Kang, Woong Joe. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hRAPN6SZqKUC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=  ''Struggle for Identity,'' pp. 38-78.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although conventionally mislabeled  as the "[[Hermit kingdom]]", Joseon's sophisticated foreign policy initiatives belie the aptness of this term.

===Recognition in the West===
The historical significance of some of these scholar-bureaucrats were confirmed when their missions and their names were specifically mentioned in a widely distributed history published by the Oriental Translation Fund in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Titsingh|Titsingh, Isaac]]. (1834). Annales des empereurs du japon, pp. 313-326.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, early published accounts of the Joseon kingdom are not extensive, but they are found in ''[[Sangoku Tsūran Zusetsu]]'' (published in Paris in 1832),&lt;ref&gt;Vos, Ken. [http://www.rmv.nl/publicaties/11Koreavroeg/e/accidentalacquisitions.pdf  "Accidental acquisitions: The nineteenth-century Korean collections in the National Museum of Ethnology, Part 1,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622021232/http://www.rmv.nl/publicaties/11Koreavroeg/e/accidentalacquisitions.pdf |date=2012-06-22 }} p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Nipon o daï itsi ran|''Nihon Ōdai Ichiran'']] (published in Paris in 1834).  Joseon foreign relations and diplomacy are explicitly referenced in the 1834 work; and some of the diplomats names are also identified.

'''Krantikari Adivasi Mahila Sangathan''' (English: ''Revolutionary [[Adivasi]] Women's Organisation'')&lt;ref name="Rahul"/&gt; is a banned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Contemporary anti-displacement struggles and women's resistance: a commentary |url=http://sanhati.com/excerpted/2923/ |first=Shoma |last=Sen |date=3 November 2010 |publisher=Sanhati |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; women's organisation based in India. The Krantikari Adivasi Mahila Sangathan (KAMS) is a successor of the Adivasi Mahila Sanghathana (AMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Broken Republic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMXB6sGPk2kC&amp;q=Krantikari+Adivasi+Mahila+Sangathan#v=snippet&amp;q=Krantikari%20Adivasi%20Mahila%20Sangathan&amp;f=false |first=Arundhati |last=Roy |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2013 |page=87 |isbn=978-8184754841}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of the AMS was laid by the [[Maoist]]s in 1986.&lt;ref name="TG-Arundhati-P4"&gt;{{cite news |title=Gandhi, but with guns: Part Four |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/27/arundhati-roy-india-tribal-maoists-4 |first=Arundhati |last=Roy |publisher=[[The Guardian]] — Books |date=27 March 2010 |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and objectives==
The count of the KAMS's registered members is about 90,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Understanding Well-Being of the Tribals in Naxalite Region |url=http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/arpanm/Understanding_Well-Being_of_the_Tribals_in_Naxalite_Region.pdf |first=Arpan |last=Maheshwari |publisher=[[Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur]] |date=24 April 2011 |accessdate=9 September 2013 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ranks it amongst the top-most women's organisations in India when it comes to numbers of registered members.&lt;ref name="TG-Arundhati-P4"/&gt; But, [[Rahul Pandita]], in 2011, claimed that the members of the KAMS are estimated to number around 100,000.&lt;ref name="Rahul"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ83V3JLXFMC |title=Hello, Bastar – The Untold Story of India's Maoist Movement |first=Rahul |last=Pandita |publisher=Westland (Tranquebar Press) |year=2011 |page=96 |isbn=978-93-80658-34-6 |oclc=754482226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KAMS concentrates on addressing various social issues faced by the women. The members of the KAMS crusades against the evil practises against women in the society like abducting the women and forcing them to marry against their will, [[polygyny]], etc. The organisation's members have also campaigned against the ''adivasi'' tradition of forcing women to stay away from the village and take shelter in the forest during her [[menstruation]] period.&lt;ref name="TG-Arundhati-P4"/&gt; The members also take a stand against the [[patriarchal]] mentality within their communities.&lt;ref name="Outlook-Arundhati"&gt;{{cite web |title=Capitalism: A Ghost Story |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?280234 |first=Arundhati |last=Roy |publisher=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]] |date=26 March 2012 |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dandakaranya]], the ''[[adivasi]]'' men did not permit the women to sow seeds in the fields, but when the members of the KAMS approached the Communist Party of India (Maoist), the party held meetings (with the adivasis) to address the issue. While during the meets, the ''adivasi'' men have accepted their mistake and decided to refrain for such activities, they are yet to bring their resolution to practise. However, the CPI (Maoist) have ensured that the women are allowed to sow seed, raise vegetables, and construct check dams "on common lands, which belongs to the ''Jantana Sarkar''"&lt;ref name="TG-Arundhati-P4"/&gt; (people's government).&lt;ref name="TG-Arundhati-P2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Gandhi, but with guns: Part Two |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/27/arundhati-roy-india-tribal-maoists-2 |first=Arundhati |last=Roy |publisher=The Guardian — Books |date=27 March 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bastar district|Bastar]], the KAMS members have rallied with hundreds in numbers to highlight the atrocities by the police, and a few times the attendance figure have been in thousands to "physically confront" the police.&lt;ref name="TG-Arundhati-P4"/&gt;

[[Arundhati Roy]] wrtites,
{{quote|"The very fact that the KAMS exists has radically changed traditional attitudes and eased many of the traditional forms of discrimination against women."&lt;ref name="TG-Arundhati-P4"/&gt;}}

The organisation's members also addresses problems like [[forced migration]] and other political issues as well.&lt;ref name="TH-1158114"&gt;{{cite news |title=Institutions of democracy weak |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/institutions-of-democracy-weak/article1158114.ece |work=[[The Hindu]] |location=Kochi |date=5 February 2011 |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roy says that the KAMS has also been opposing [[mining]] in the Dandakaranya region.&lt;ref name="Outlook-Arundhati"/&gt;

==Alleged atrocities by Salwa Judum==
A senior worker from the KAMS told Arundhati Roy that after facing "bestial sexual mutilation" and getting raped by the [[Salwa Judum]] members, several of the organisation's members have left the KAMS and joined the CPI (Maoist). A number of girls, who were not the members of the KAMS but witnessed the atrocities upon the KAMS members by the Salwa Judum members, have also joined the Maoists.&lt;ref name="TG-Arundhati-P4"/&gt;

==Legal status==
The KAMS was reported to be a [[Front organization|frontal organisation]] of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) People's War]], and was thus banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New guerrilla squad emerges in Madhya Pradesh |url=http://hindu.com/2005/08/18/stories/2005081810950500.htm |work=The Hindu |location=Bhopal |date=18 August 2005 |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arundhati Roy says that the [[Government of India]] can "wipe out" all the 90,000 members of the organisation, any time.&lt;ref name="TH-1158114"/&gt; She writes,

'''Labeling theory''' is the theory of how the [[self-identity]] and behavior of individuals may be determined or influenced by the terms used to describe or classify them.  It is associated with the concepts of [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] and [[stereotype|stereotyping]]. Labeling theory holds that [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]] is not inherent to an act, but instead focuses on the tendency of majorities to negatively label minorities or those seen as deviant from standard [[cultural norm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Labeling theory: Social constructionism, Social stigma, Deinstitutionalisation, George Herbert Mead, Howard S. Becker, Labelling&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was prominent during the 1960s and 1970s, and some modified versions of the theory have developed and are still currently popular. A stigma is defined as a powerfully negative label that changes a person's self-concept and [[social identity]].&lt;ref name="Macionis"&gt;{{harvp|Macionis|Gerber|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labeling theory is closely related to [[social constructionism|social-construction]] and [[symbolic interactionism|symbolic-interaction]] analysis.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt;  Labeling theory was developed by [[sociologist]]s during the 1960s. [[Howard S. Becker|Howard Saul Becker's]] book ''Outsiders'' was extremely influential in the development of this theory and its rise to popularity.

==Theoretical basis==
Labeling theory had its origins in ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'', a book by French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]]. He found that crime is not so much a violation of a penal code as it is an act that outrages society. He was the first to suggest that deviant labeling satisfies that function and satisfies society's need to control the behavior.

As a contributor to [[American Pragmatism]] and later a member of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]], [[George Herbert Mead]] posited that the self is socially constructed and reconstructed through the interactions which each person has with the [[community]]. The labeling theory suggests that people obtain labels from how others view their tendencies or behaviors. Each individual is aware of how they are judged by others because he or she has attempted many different roles and functions in social interactions and has been able to gauge the reactions of those present.

This theoretically builds a subjective conception of the self, but as others intrude into the reality of that individual's life, this represents objective data which may require a re-evaluation of that conception depending on the authoritativeness of the others' judgment. [[Family]] and [[friend]]s may judge differently from random strangers. More socially representative individuals such as [[police officer]]s or [[judge]]s may be able to make more globally respected judgments. If deviance is a failure to conform to the rules observed by most of the group, the reaction of the group is to label the person as having offended against their social or moral norms of behavior. This is the power of the group: to designate breaches of their rules as deviant and to treat the person differently depending on the seriousness of the breach. The more differential the treatment, the more the individual's [[self-image]] is affected.

Labeling theory concerns itself mostly not with the normal roles that define our lives, but with those very special roles that society provides for [[social deviance|deviant behavior]], called deviant roles, stigmatic roles, or [[social stigma]]. A social role is a set of expectations we have about a behavior. Social roles are necessary for the organization and functioning of any society or group. We expect the postman, for example, to adhere to certain fixed rules about how he does his job. "Deviance" for a sociologist does not mean morally wrong, but rather behavior that is condemned by society. Deviant behavior can include both criminal and non-criminal activities.

Investigators found that deviant roles powerfully affect how we perceive those who are assigned those roles. They also affect how the deviant actor perceives himself and his relationship to society. The deviant roles and the labels attached to them function as a form of social stigma. Always inherent in the deviant role is the attribution of some form of "pollution" or difference that marks the labeled person as different from others. Society uses these stigmatic roles to them to control and limit deviant behavior: "If you proceed in this behavior, you will become a member of that group of people."

Whether a breach of a given rule will be stigmatized will depend on the significance of the [[morality|moral]] or other tenet it represents. For example, [[adultery]] may be considered a breach of an informal rule or it may be [[criminalize]]d depending on the status of [[marriage]], morality, and [[religion]] within the community. In most Western countries, adultery is not a crime. Attaching the label "adulterer" may have some unfortunate consequences but they are not generally severe. But in some Islamic countries, [[zina (Arabic)|zina]] is a crime and proof of extramarital activity may lead to severe consequences for all concerned.

Stigma is usually the result of laws enacted against the behavior. Laws protecting slavery or outlawing homosexuality, for instance, will over time form deviant roles connected with those behaviors. Those who are assigned those roles will be seen as less human and reliable. Deviant roles are the sources of negative [[stereotype]]s, which tend to support society's disapproval of the behavior.

===George Herbert Mead===
One of the founders of social [[interactionism]], [[George Herbert Mead]] focused on the internal processes of how the mind constructs one's self-image. In ''Mind, Self, and Society'' (1934),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mead|1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; he showed how infants come to know ''persons'' first and only later come to know ''things''. According to Mead, thought is both a ''social'' and ''[[pragmaticism|pragmatic]]'' process, based on the model of two persons discussing how to solve a problem. Mead's central concept is the self, the part of an individual's personality composed of self-awareness and self-image.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Macionis|2012|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our self-image is, in fact, constructed of ideas about what we think others are thinking about us. While we make fun of those who visibly talk to themselves, they have only failed to do what the rest of us do in keeping the internal conversation to ourselves. Human behavior, Mead stated, is the result of meanings created by the social interaction of conversation, both real and imaginary.

===Thomas Scheff===
[[Thomas J. Scheff]], Professor, Emeritus, Dept of Sociology, UCSB, published the book Being Mentally III: A Sociological Theory (1966).
According to Scheff society has perceptions about people with mental illness. He stated that everyone in the society learns the stereotyped imagery of mental disorder through ordinary social interaction. From childhood, people learn to use terms like “crazy”, “loony”, “nuts” and associated them with them with disturbed behaviors. The media also contributes to this bias against mentally ill patients by associating them with violent crimes. Scheff believes that mental illness is a label given to a person who has a behavior which is away from the social norms of the society and is treated as a social deviance in the society. Once a person is given a label of “mentally ill person”, s/he receives a set of uniform responses from the society, which are generally negative in nature. These responses from the society compel to the person to take the role of a “mentally ill person” as s/he starts internalizing the same. When the individual takes on the role of being mentally ill as her/his central identity, s/he becomes a stable mental ill person. Chronic mental illness is thus a social role and the societal reaction is the most determinant of one’s entry into this role of chronically ill. 
According to Scheff hospitalization of a mentally ill person further reinforces this social role and forces her/him to take this role as her/his self-perception. Once the person is institutionalized for mental disorder, s/he has been publicly labeled as “crazy” and forced to become a member of a deviant social group. It then becomes difficult for a deviant person to return to her/his former level of functioning as the status of ‘patient’ causes unfavorable evaluations by self and by others.

===Frank Tannenbaum===
[[Frank Tannenbaum]] is considered the grandfather of labeling theory. His ''Crime and Community'' (1938),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tannenbaum|1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the social interaction involved in crime, is considered a pivotal foundation of modern criminology. While the criminal differs little or not at all from others in the original impulse to first commit a crime, social interaction accounts for continued acts that develop a pattern of interest to sociologists.

Tannenbaum first introduced the idea of 'tagging'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|O'Grady|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While conducting his studies with delinquent youth, he found that a negative tag or label often contributed to further involvement in delinquent activities. This initial tagging may cause the individual to adopt it as part of their identity. The crux of Tannenbaum's argument is that the greater the attention placed on this label, the more likely the person is to identify themselves as the label.

Kerry Townsend writes about the revolution in criminology caused by Tannenbaum's work:

:"The roots of Frank Tannenbaum's theoretical model, known as the "dramatization of evil" or labeling theory, surfaces in the mid- to late-thirties. At this time, the 'New Deal' legislation had not defeated the woes of the Great Depression, and, although dwindling, immigration into the United States continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sumner|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social climate was one of disillusionment with the government. The class structure was one of cultural isolationism; cultural relativity had not yet taken hold. 'The persistence of the class structure, despite the welfare reforms and controls over big business, was unmistakable.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sumner|1994|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Positivist School of Criminological thought was still dominant, and in many states, the sterilization movement was underway. The emphasis on biological determinism and internal explanations of crime were the preeminent force in the theories of the early thirties. This dominance by the Positivist School changed in the late thirties with the introduction of conflict and social explanations of crime and criminality...

:"One of the central tenets of the theory is to encourage the end of labeling process. In the words of Frank Tannenbaum, "the way out is through a refusal to dramatize the evil", the justice system attempts to do this through diversion programs. The growth of the theory and its current application, both practical and theoretical, provide a solid foundation for continued popularity.":&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, F. ''Frank Tannenbaum: The Dramatization of Evil''. {{cite web |url=http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/tannenbaum.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426080156/http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/tannenbaum.htm |archivedate=2009-04-26 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edwin Lemert===
It was sociologist [[Edwin Lemert]] (1951) who introduced the concept of "[[secondary deviance]]". The primary deviance is the experience connected to the overt behavior, say drug addiction and its practical demands and consequences. Secondary deviation is the role created to deal with society's condemnation of the behavior of a person.

With other sociologists of his time, Lemert saw how all deviant acts are social acts, a result of the cooperation of society. In studying drug addiction, Lemert observed a very powerful and subtle force at work. Besides the physical addiction to the drug and all the economic and social disruptions it caused, there was an intensely intellectual process at work concerning one's own identity and the justification for the behavior: "I do these things because I am this way."

There might be certain subjective and personal motives that might first lead a person to drink or shoplift. But the activity itself tells us little about the person's self-image or its relationship to the activity. Lemert writes: "His acts are repeated and organized subjectively and transformed into active roles and become the social criteria for assigning status.....When a person begins to employ his deviant behavior or a role based on it as a means of defense, attack, or adjustment to the overt and covert problems created by the consequent societal reaction to him, his deviation is secondary".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lemert|1951|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Howard Becker===
While it was Lemert who introduced the key concepts of labeling theory, it was [[Howard S. Becker|Howard Becker]] who became their successor. He first began describing the process of how a person adopts a deviant role in a study of dance musicians, with whom he once worked. He later studied the identity formation of marijuana smokers. This study was the basis of his ''Outsiders'' published in 1963. This work became the manifesto of the labeling theory movement among sociologists. In his opening, Becker writes:

:"...''social groups create deviance by making rules whose infraction creates deviance'', and by applying those rules to particular people and labeling them as outsiders. From this point of view, deviance is ''not'' a quality of the act the person commits, but rather a consequence of the application by other of rules and sanctions to an 'offender.' The deviant is one to whom that label has been successfully applied; deviant behavior is behavior that people so label."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Becker|1973|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While society uses the stigmatic label to justify its condemnation, the deviant actor uses it to justify his actions. He wrote: "To put a complex argument in a few words: instead of the deviant motives leading to the deviant behavior, it is the other way around, the deviant behavior in time produces the deviant motivation."&lt;ref name="Becker_26"&gt;{{harvp|Becker|1973|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker's immensely popular views were also subjected to a barrage of criticism, most of it blaming him for neglecting the influence of other biological, genetic effects and personal responsibility. In a later 1973 edition of his work, he answered his critics. He wrote that sociologists, while dedicated to studying society, are often careful not to look too closely. Instead, he wrote: "I prefer to think of what we study as ''collective action.'' People act, as Mead and Blumer have made clearest, ''together''. They do what they do with an eye on what others have done, are doing now, and may do in the future. One tries to fit his own line of action into the actions of others, just as each of them likewise adjusts his own developing actions to what he sees and expects others to do."&lt;ref name="Becker_26"/&gt;

Francis Cullen reported in 1984 that Becker was probably too generous with his critics. After 20 years, his views, far from being supplanted, have been corrected and absorbed into an expanded "structuring perspective".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cullen|1984|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albert Memmi===
In ''The Colonizer and the Colonized'' (1965) [[Albert Memmi]] described the deep psychological effects of the social stigma created by the domination of one group by another. He wrote:

:"The longer the oppression lasts, the more profoundly it affects him (the oppressed). It ends by becoming so familiar to him that he believes it is part of his own constitution, that he accepts it and could not imagine his recovery from it. This acceptance is the crowning point of oppression."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Memmi|1965|pp=321–322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Dominated Man'' (1968), Memmi turned his attention to the motivation of stigmatic labeling: it justifies the exploitation or criminalization of the victim. He wrote:

:"Why does the accuser feel obliged to accuse in order to justify himself? ''Because he feels guilty toward his victim.'' Because he feels that his attitude and his behavior are essentially unjust and fraudulent....Proof? ''In almost every case, the punishment has already been inflicted''. The victim of racism is already living under the weight of disgrace and oppression.... In order to justify such punishment and misfortune, a process of rationalization is set in motion, by which to explain the ghetto and colonial exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Memmi|1968|pp=191–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to stigmatic labeling is the attribution of an inherent fault: It is as if one says, "There must be something wrong with these people. Otherwise, why would we treat them so badly?"

===Erving Goffman===
Perhaps the most important contributor to labeling theory was [[Erving Goffman]], President of the American Sociological Association, and one of America's most cited sociologists. His most popular books include ''[[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Interaction Ritual'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Frame Analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most important contribution to labeling theory, however, was ''Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity'' published in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other authors who examined the process of adopting a deviant identity, Goffman explored the ways people managed that identity and controlled information about it.

Among Goffman's key insights were the following:
* The modern nation state's heightened demand for normalcy. Today's stigmas are the result not so much of ancient or religious prohibitions, but of a new demand for normalcy. He wrote: "The notion of the 'normal human being' may have its source in the medical approach to humanity, or in the tendency of large-scale bureaucratic organizations such as the nation state, to treat all members in some respects as equal. Whatever its origins, it seems to provide the basic imagery through which laymen currently conceive themselves.''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Living in a divided world. Deviants divide their worlds into 1. forbidden places where discovery means exposure and danger, 2. places where people of that kind are painfully tolerated, and 3. places where one's kind is exposed without need to dissimulate or conceal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dealing with others is fraught with great complexity and ambiguity. He wrote: "When normals and stigmatized do in fact enter one another's immediate presence, especially when they attempt to maintain a joint conversational encounter, there occurs one of the primal scenes of sociology; for, in many cases, these moments will be the ones when the causes and effects of stigma will be directly confronted by both sides....&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; "What are unthinking routines for normals can become management problems for the discreditable....The person with a secret failing, then, must be alive to the social situation as a scanner of possibilities, and is therefore likely to be alienated from the simpler world in which those around them apparently dwell."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Society's demands are filled with contradictions. On the one hand, a stigmatized person may be told that he is no different from others. On the other hand, he must declare his status as "a resident alien who stands for his group."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It requires that the stigmatized individual cheerfully and unselfconsciously accept himself as essentially the same as normals, while at the same time he voluntarily withholds himself from those situations in which normals would find it difficult to give lip service to their similar acceptance of him..." One has to convey the impression that the burden of the stigma is not too heavy yet keep himself at the required distance. "A ''phantom acceptance'' is allowed to provide the base for a ''phantom normalcy."''&lt;ref name="harvp|Goffman|1963|p=122"&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Familiarity need not reduce contempt. In spite of the common belief that openness and exposure will decrease stereotypes and repression, the opposite is true. "Thus, whether we interact with strangers or intimates, we will still find that the fingertips of society have reached bluntly into the contact, even here putting us in our place."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Matza===
In ''On Becoming Deviant'' (1969),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matza|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; sociologist David Matza gives the most vivid and graphic account of the process of adopting a deviant role. The acts of authorities in outlawing a proscribed behavior can have two effects, keeping most out of the behavior, but also offering new opportunities for creating deviant identities. He says the concept of "affinity" does little to explain the dedication to the behavior. "Instead, it may be regarded as a natural biographical tendency born of personal and social circumstances that suggests but hardly compels a direction or movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matza|1969|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; What gives force to that movement is the development of a new identity. He writes:

:"To be cast as a thief, as a prostitute, or more generally, a deviant, is to further compound and hasten the process of becoming that very thing...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matza|1969|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In shocked discovery, the subject now concretely understands that there are serious people who really go around building their lives around his activities--stopping him, correcting him, devoted to him. They keep records on the course of his life, even develop theories on how he got that way.... Pressed by such a display, the subject may begin to add meaning and gravity to his deviant activities. But he may do so in a way not especially intended by agents of the state...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matza|1969|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The meaningful issue of identity is whether this activity, or any of my activities can stand for me, or be regarded as proper indications of my being. I have done a theft, been signified a thief. ''am'' I a thief? To answer affirmatively, we must be able to conceive a special relationship between being and doing--a unity capable of being indicated. That building of meaning has a notable quality."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matza|1969|pp=165–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "criminal" ==
{{Criminology and penology |theory}}

As an application of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the theory hypothesizes that the labels applied to individuals influence their behavior, particularly the application of negative or stigmatizing labels (such as "[[criminal]]" or "[[Felony|felon]]") promote [[Deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]], becoming a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], i.e. an individual who is labeled has little choice but to conform to the essential meaning of that judgment. Consequently, labeling theory postulates that it is possible to prevent social deviance via a limited social shaming reaction in "labelers" and replacing [[Morality|moral]] indignation with [[Toleration|tolerance]]. Emphasis is placed on the [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] of offenders through an alteration of their label(s). Related prevention policies include client [[empowerment]] schemes, [[mediation]] and [[conciliation]], victim-offender [[forgiveness]] ceremonies (restorative justice), [[restitution]], [[Reparation (legal)|reparation]], and alternatives to prison programs involving [[Hobby|diversion]]. Labeling theory has been accused of promoting impractical policy implications, and criticized for failing to explain society's most serious offenses.&lt;ref name="Vito1"&gt;{{harvp|Vito|Maahs|Holmes|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some offenses, including the use of violence, are universally recognized as wrong. Hence, labeling either habitual criminals or those who have caused serious harm as "criminals" is not constructive. Society may use more ''specific'' labels such as "[[murder]]er" or "[[rapist]]" or "[[child abuse]]r" to demonstrate more clearly after the event the extent of its disapproval, but there is a slightly mechanical determinism in asserting that the application of a label will invariably modify the behavior of the one labeled. Further, if one of the functions of the penal system is to reduce [[recidivism]], applying a long-term label may cause prejudice against the offender, resulting in the inability to maintain employment and social relationships.

==The "mentally ill"==
The social construction of [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] plays an important role in the labeling process that occurs in society. This process involves not only the labeling of criminally deviant behavior, which is behavior that does not fit socially constructed norms, but also labeling that which reflects stereotyped or stigmatized behavior of the "mentally ill". Labeling theory was first applied to the term "[[mentally ill]]" in 1966 when [[Thomas J. Scheff]] published ''Being Mentally Ill''. Scheff challenged common perceptions of [[mental illness]] by claiming that mental illness is manifested solely as a result of societal influence. He argued that society views certain actions as [[deviant]] and, in order to come to terms with and understand these actions, often places the label of mental illness on those who exhibit them. Certain expectations are then placed on these individuals and, over time, they unconsciously change their behavior to fulfill them. Criteria for different mental illnesses are not consistently fulfilled by those who are diagnosed with them because all of these people suffer from the same disorder, they are simply fulfilled because the "mentally ill" believe they are supposed to act a certain way so, over time, come to do so.&lt;ref name=Scheff1&gt;{{harvp|Scheff|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scheff's theory had many critics, most notably [[Walter Gove]]. Gove consistently argued an almost opposite theory; he believed that society has no influence at all on "mental illness". Instead, any societal perceptions of the "mentally ill" come about as a direct result of these people's behaviors. Most sociologists' views of labeling and mental illness have fallen somewhere between the extremes of Gove and Scheff. On the other hand, it is almost impossible to deny, given both common sense and research findings, that society's negative perceptions of "crazy" people has had some effect on them. It seems that, realistically, labeling can accentuate and prolong the issues termed "mental illness", but it is rarely the full cause.&lt;ref name=Gove1&gt;{{harvp|Gove|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other studies have been conducted in this general vein. To provide a few examples, several studies have indicated that most people associate being labeled mentally ill as being just as, or even more, stigmatizing than being seen as a [[drug addict]], ex-convict, or [[prostitute]] (for example: Brand &amp; Claiborn 1976). Additionally, Page's 1977 study found that self declared "ex-mental patients" are much less likely to be offered apartment leases or hired for jobs. Clearly, these studies and the dozens of others like them serve to demonstrate that labeling can have a very real and very large effect on the mentally ill. However, labeling has not been proven to be the sole cause of any symptoms of mental illness.

Peggy Thoits discusses the process of labeling someone with a mental illness in her article, "Sociological Approaches to Mental Illness". Working off Thomas Scheff's (1966) theory, Thoits claims that people who are labeled as mentally ill are stereotypically portrayed as unpredictable, dangerous, and unable to care for themselves. She also claims that "people who are labeled as deviant and treated as deviant become deviant".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thoits|1999|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement can be broken down into two processes, one that involves the effects of self-labeling and the other differential treatment from society based on the individual's label. Therefore, if society sees mentally ill individuals as unpredictable, dangerous and reliant on others, then a person who may not actually be mentally ill but has been labeled as such, could become mentally ill.

The label of "mentally ill" may help a person seek help, for example [[psychotherapy]] or [[medication]]. Labels, while they can be stigmatizing, can also lead those who bear them down the road to proper treatment and (hopefully) recovery. If one believes that "being mentally ill" is more than just believing one should fulfill a set of [[diagnostic criteria]] (as Scheff – see above – would argue{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}), then one would probably also agree that there are some who are labeled "mentally ill" who need help. It has been claimed that this could not happen if "we" did not have a way to categorize (and therefore label) them, although there are actually plenty of [[classification of mental disorder|approaches]] to these phenomena that don't use categorical classifications and diagnostic terms, for example [[spectrum disorder|spectrum]] or continuum models. Here, people vary along different dimensions, and everyone falls at different points on each dimension.

Proponents of ''hard labeling'', as opposed to ''soft labeling'', believe that mental illness does not exist, but is merely deviance from [[norm (sociology)|norms]] of society, causing people to believe in mental illness. They view them as socially constructed illnesses and psychotic disorders.&lt;ref name=Link1&gt;{{harvp|Link|Phelan|1999|pp=361–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "homosexual"==
The application of labeling theory to homosexuality has been extremely controversial. It was [[Alfred Kinsey]] and his colleagues who pointed out the big discrepancy between the behavior and the role attached to it. They had observed the often negative consequences of labeling and repeatedly condemned labeling people as homosexual:

:"It is amazing to observe how many psychologists and psychiatrists have accepted this sort of propaganda, and have come to believe that homosexual males and females are discretely different from persons who respond to natural stimuli. Instead of using these terms as substantives which stand for persons, or even as adjectives to describe persons, they may better be used to describe the nature of the overt sexual relations, or of the stimuli to which an individual erotically responds... It would clarify our thinking if the terms could be dropped completely out of our vocabulary....&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kinsey|Pomeroy|Martin|1948|pp=616–617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Males do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual... Only the human mind invents categories and tries to force facts into pigeonholes. The living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kinsey|Pomeroy|Martin|1948|p=639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The classification of sexual behavior as masturbatory, heterosexual, or homosexual, is, therefore, unfortunate if it suggests that only different types of persons seek out or accept each kind of sexual activity. There is nothing known in the anatomy or physiology of sexual response and orgasm which distinguishes masturbatory, heterosexual, or homosexual reactions....&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kinsey|Pomeroy|Martin|Gebhard|1953|p=446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In regard to sexual behavior, it has been possible to maintain this dichotomy only by placing all persons who are exclusively heterosexual in a heterosexual category and all persons who have any amount of experience with their own sex, even including those with the slightest experience, in a homosexual category.... The attempt to maintain a simple dichotomy on these matters exposes the traditional biases which are likely to enter whenever the heterosexual or homosexual classification of an individual is involved".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kinsey|Pomeroy|Martin|Gebhard|1953|pp=468–469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erving Goffman's ''Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity'' distinguished between the behavior and the role assigned to it. He wrote:

:"The term 'homosexual' is generally used to refer to anyone who engages in overt sexual practices with a member of his own sex, the practice being called 'homosexuality.' This usage appears to be based on a medical and legal frame of reference and provides much too broad and heterogenous a categorization for use here. I refer only to individuals who participate in a special community of understanding wherein members of one's own sex are defined as the most desirable sexual objects, and sociability is energetically organized around the pursuit and entertainment of these objects."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labeling theory was also applied to homosexuality by Evelyn Hooker&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hooker|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hooker|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hooker|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Leznoff and Westley, who published the first sociological study of the gay community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leznoff|Westley|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erving Goffman and Howard Becker used the lives of gay-identified persons in their theories of labeling and interactionism. Simon and Gagnon likewise wrote: "It is necessary to move away from the obsessive concern with the sexuality of the individual, and attempt to see the homosexual in terms of the broader attachments that he must make to live in the world around him."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Simon|Gagnon|1967|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British sociologist Mary McIntosh reflected the enthusiasm of Europeans for labeling theory in her 1968 study, "The Homosexual Role".

:"The vantage-point of comparative sociology enables us to see that the conception of homosexuality as a condition is, itself, a possible object of study. This conception and the behavior it supports operate as a form of social control in a society in which homosexuality is condemned...

:"It is interesting to notice that homosexuals themselves welcome and support the notion that homosexuality as a condition. For just as the rigid categorization deters people from drifting into deviancy, so it appears to foreclose on the possibility of drifting back into normalcy and thus removes the element of anxious choice. It appears to justify the deviant behavior of the homosexual as being appropriate for him as a member of the homosexual category. The deviancy can thus be seen as legitimate for him and he can continue in it without rejecting the norm of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McIntosh|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sara Fein and Elaine M. Nuehring were among the many who supported the application of labeling theory to homosexuality. They saw the gay role functioning as a "master status" around which other roles become organized. This brings a whole new set of problems and restrictions:

:"Placement in a social category constituting a master status prohibits individuals from choosing the extent of their involvement in various categories. Members of the stigmatized group lose the opportunity to establish their own personal system of evaluation and group membership as well as the ability to arrive at their own ranking of each personal characteristic.... For example, newly self-acknowledged homosexual individuals cannot take for granted that they share the world with others who hold congruent interpretations and assumptions; their behavior and motives, both past and present, will be interpreted in light of their stigma."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fein|Nuehring|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the strongest proponent of labeling theory was Edward Sagarin. In his book, ''Deviants and Deviance'', he wrote, "There are no homosexuals, transvestites, chemical addicts, suicidogenics, delinquents, criminals, or other such entities, in the sense of people having such identities."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sagarin|1975|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagarin's position was roundly condemned by academics in the gay community. Sagarin had written some gay novels under the pseudonym of Donald Webster Cory. According to reports, he later abandoned his gay identity and began promoting an interactionist view of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBay|1967|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of authors adopted a modified, non-deviant, labeling theory. They rejected the stigmatic function of the gay role, but found it useful in describing the process of [[coming out]] and reconciling one's homosexual experiences with the social role. Their works included:
* [[Colin J. Williams]] and [[Martin Weinberg]], ''Homosexuals and the Military'', 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Williams|Weinberg|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Barry Dank, "Coming Out in the Gay World," 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dank|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sue Hammersmith and Martin Weinberg, "Homosexual Identity: Commitment, Adjustment, and Significant Others," 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hammersmith|Weinberg|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Martin Weinberg and Colin Williams, in "Male Homosexuals: Their Problems and Adaptations," 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Weinberg|Williams|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Carol A. B. Warren, in ''Identity and Community in the Gay World,'' 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Warren|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Michael Shively and John DeCecco, "Components of Sexual Identity," 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shively|DeCecco|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Richard Troiden, "Becoming Homosexual: A model of Gay Identity Acquisition," 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Troiden|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alan Bell, Martin Weinberg, and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith, ''Sexual Preference: Its Development in Men and Women,'' 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bell|Weinberg|Hammersmith|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eli Coleman, "Developmental Stages of the Coming Out Process", 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Coleman|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Adam, in his ''Survival of Domination: Inferiorization of Everyday Life'', took those authors to task for ignoring the force of the oppression in creating identities and their inferiorizing effects. Drawing upon the works of [[Albert Memmi]], Adam showed how gay-identified persons, like Jews and blacks, internalize the hatred to justify their limitations of life choices. He saw the gravitation towards ghettos was evidence of the self-limitations. He wrote:

:"A certain romantic liberalism runs through the literature, evident from attempts to paper over or discount the very real problems of inferiorization. Some researchers seem bent on 'rescuing' their subjects from 'defamation' by ignoring the problems of defeatism and complicit self-destruction. Avoidance of dispiriting reflection upon the day-to-day practice of dominated people appears to spring from a desire to 'enhance' the reputation of the dominated and magically relieve their plight. Careful observation has been sacrificed to the 'power of positive thinking.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adam|1978|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong defense of labeling theory also arose within the gay community. Dan Slater of the Los Angeles Homosexual Information Center said, "There is no such thing as a homosexual lifestyle. There is no such thing as gay pride or anything like that. Homosexuality is simply based on the sex act. Gay consciousness and all the rest are separatist and defeatist attitudes going back to centuries-old and out-moded conceptions that homosexuals are, indeed, different from other people."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leopold|1975|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later article, Slater stated the gay movement was going in the wrong direction:

:"Is it the purpose of the movement to try to assert sexual rights for everyone or create a political and social cult out of homosexuality?.... Persons who perform homosexual acts or other non-conforming acts are sexually free. They want others enlightened. They want hostile laws changed, but they resent the attempt to organize their lives around homosexuality just as much as they resent the centuries-old attempt to organize their lives around heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Slater|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William DuBay, in ''Gay Identity: The Self Under Ban'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBay|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes gay identity as one strategy for dealing with society's oppression. It solves some problems but creates many more, replacing a closet of secrecy with one of gay identity. A better strategy, he suggests, is to reject the label and live as if the oppression did not exist. Quoting Goffman, he writes, "But of course what is a good adjustment for the individual can be an even better one for society."&lt;ref name="harvp|Goffman|1963|p=122"/&gt; 

DuBay contends that the attempt to define homosexuality as a class of persons to be protected against discrimination as defined in the statutes has not reduced the oppression. The goal of the movement instead should be to gain acceptance of homosexual relationships as useful and productive for both society and the family. The movement has lost the high moral ground by sponsoring the "flight from choice" and not taking up the moral issues. "Persons whom we confine to back rooms and bars other societies have honored as tenders of children, astrologers, dancers, chanters, minstrels, jesters, artists, shamans, sacred warriors and judges, seers, healers, weavers of tales and magic."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBay|1967|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DuBay refers to the "gay trajectory," in which a person first wraps himself in the gay role, organizing his personality and his life around sexual behavior. He might flee from his family and home town to a large gay center. There, the bedeviling force of the stigma will introduce him to more excessive modes of deviance such as promiscuity, prostitution, alcoholism, and drugs. Many resist such temptations and try to normalize their life, but the fast lanes of gay society are littered with the casualties of gay identity. Some come to reject the label entirely. "Accomplishing the forbidden, they are neither gay nor straight. Again learning to choose, they develop the ability to make the ban ambiguous, taking responsibility and refusing explanations of their behaviors."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBay|1967|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Henry Mackay writes about a gay hustler in Berlin adopting such a solution: "What was self-evident, natural, and not the least sick did not require an excuse through an explanation.... It was love just like any other love. Whoever could not or would not accept it as love was mistaken."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mackay|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modified labeling theory==
Bruce Link and colleagues have conducted several studies which point to the influence that labeling can have on mental patients. Through these studies, which took place in 1987, 1989, and 1997, Link advanced a "modified labeling theory" indicating that expectations of labeling can have a large negative effect, that these expectations often cause patients to withdraw from society, and that those labeled as having a mental disorder are constantly being rejected from society in seemingly minor ways but that, when taken as a whole, all of these small slights can drastically alter their self concepts. They come to both anticipate and perceive negative societal reactions to them, and this potentially damages their quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Link|Cullen|Struening|Shrout|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modified labeling theory has been described as a "sophisticated social-psychological model of 'why labels matter{{'"}}. In 2000, results from a prospective two-year study of patients discharged from a mental hospital (in the context of [[deinstitutionalization]]) showed that [[social stigma|stigma]] was a powerful and persistent force in their lives, and that experiences of [[social rejection]] were a persistent source of social stress. Efforts to cope with labels, such as not telling anyone, educating people about mental distress/disorder, withdrawing from stigmatizing situations, could result in further social isolation and reinforce negative self-concepts. Sometimes an identity as a low [[self-esteem]] minority in society would be accepted. The stigma was associated with diminished motivation and ability to "make it in mainstream society" and with "a state of social and psychological vulnerability to prolonged and recurrent problems". There was an up and down pattern in self-esteem, however, and it was suggested that, rather than simply gradual erosion of self-worth and increasing [[self-deprecating]] tendencies, people were sometimes managing, but struggling, to maintain consistent feelings of self-worth. Ultimately, "a cadre of patients had developed an entrenched, negative view of themselves, and their experiences of rejection appear to be a key element in the construction of these self-related feelings" and "hostile neighbourhoods may not only affect their self-concept but may also ultimately impact the patient's mental health status and how successful they are".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wright|Gronfein|Owens|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8984">The '''Land Tenure Reform Association''' (LTRA) was a British pressure group for [[land reform]], founded by [[John Stuart Mill]] in 1868. The Association opposed [[primogeniture]], and sought legal changes on [[entail]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eugenio F. Biagini|title=Liberty, Retrenchment and Reform: Popular Liberalism in the Age of Gladstone, 1860–1880|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XG7YIj_97gkC&amp;pg=PA189|date=3 May 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-54886-1|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its programme fell short of the [[nationalisation]] of land demanded by the contemporary [[Land and Labour League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Royle|title=Radicals, Secularists, and Republicans: Popular Freethought in Britain, 1866–1915|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMhRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA795|year=1980|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-0783-5|page=795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The context of the formation of the Association was the aftermath of the [[Reform Act 1867]]. While the franchise had been extended, the [[Reform League]] that had pushed for the extension then collapsed as a political force. In parallel, Mill and [[Edmond Beales]] set up the Association to promote further reform and change. Besides modifications to land law, they proposed also to encourage co-operative agriculture and smallholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Vernon|title=Politics and the People: A Study in English Political Culture, 1815–1867|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wc5OHqnMrscC&amp;pg=PA316|date=2 September 1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42090-7|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political role==
Following a launch of a programme by Mill in July 1870, and organisational work in which [[Thomas Hare (political scientist)|Thomas Hare]] and [[Jacob Bright]] were involved, the Association held its first public meeting in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nationalization in British Politics: The Historical Background|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJ-aAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA72|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-0197-6|page=72 note 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Reeves|title=John Stuart Mill: Victorian Firebrand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQlYBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1876|date=9 February 2015|publisher=Atlantic Books, Limited|isbn=978-1-78239-713-7|pages=1876 note 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key plank of the Association's programme was taxation of the [[unearned increment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Hollander|title=John Stuart Mill: Political Economist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-CiCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA272|date=13 March 2015|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4663-99-1|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mill's advocacy of this measure presaged more radical proposals of the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Read|title=The Age of Urban Democracy: England 1868–1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-23XAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA292|date=17 June 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-89591-6|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; His views influenced [[Arthur Arnold]], president of the [[Free Land League]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=30454|first=Jonathan|last=Spain|title=Arnold, Sir (Robert) Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1870 ''[[The Economist]]'' argued that the LTRA's emphasis on freeing up trade in land in fact would work against the expansion of peasant proprietors, since the wealthy would pay high prices for land.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. L. Thompson, "Land and Politics in England in the Nineteenth Century", ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'', Vol. 15 (1965), pp. 23–44, at p. 40. Published by: Cambridge University Press on behalf of the Royal Historical Society. {{doi|10.2307/3678815}}. {{JSTOR|3678815}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural labour's interests were represented at meetings of the LTRA by [[Joseph Arch]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Southall, "Agitate! Agitate! Organize! Political Travellers and the Construction of a National Politics, 1839–1880", ''Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers'' Vol. 21, No. 1 (1996), pp. 177–193, at p. 184. Published by: Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers). {{doi|10.2307/622932}}. {{JSTOR|622932}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Mill's death on 1873, the Association's effective role came to an end. Mill had handed over to [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]. It was in the early 1880s that Wallace's writings led to the formation of the [[Land Nationalisation Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Trish Ferguson|title=Thomas Hardy's Legal Fictions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F4ylBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147|year=2013|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-7324-7|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=36700|first=Charles H.|last=Smith|title=Wallace, Alfred Russel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association itself closed down in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margot C. Finn|title=After Chartism: Class and Nation in English Radical Politics 1848–1874|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W8f9cvs9DuoC&amp;pg=PA301|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52598-5|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land reform was a more important issue at the [[1885 general election]] than at any previous time, or subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;David Nicholls, "The New Liberalism: After Chartism?", ''Social History'' Vol. 21, No. 3 (Oct., 1996), pp. 330–342, at p. 334. Published by: Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. {{JSTOR|4286364}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Besides Mill, the LTRA had other economists as members: [[John E. Cairnes]], [[Cliffe Leslie]] and [[Thorold Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Newton, "The Impact of Henry George on British Economists, I: The First Phase of Response, 1879–82; Leslie, Wicksteed and Hobson". ''The American Journal of Economics and Sociology'' 30.2 (1971): 179–186, at p. 182. {{JSTOR|3485386}}.&lt;/ref&gt; English Members of Parliament (MPs) joined in numbers, but Irish MPs did not support the LTRA.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Augustus Maxse]], ''The French Press and Ireland: five letters on the Irish question addressed to La Justice'', 1888, at p. 39, LSE Selected Pamphlets, {{JSTOR|60216679}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxse described as "trusted Radicals and working class politicians" the group of supporters Edmond Beales, [[Charles Dilke]], [[George Jacob Holyoake]], [[Lloyd Jones (socialist)|Lloyd Jones]], [[Benjamin Lucraft]], [[Edward Miall]], [[Walter Morrison (MP)|Walter Morrison]], [[George Odger]], [[Peter Alfred Taylor]] and John Weston.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Augustus Maxse, ''The Causes of Social Revolt: a lecture delivered in London, Portsmouth, Bradford, Nottingham, Derby, and Greenwich'' (1872), p. 32. Bristol Selected Pamphlets. {{JSTOR|60243276}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The LTRA initially grew out of the Radical Club, and Dilke acted as its secretary in its early life.&lt;ref name="Nicholls1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Nicholls|title=The Lost Prime Minister: A Life of Sir Charles Dilke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xee1m8EYQwMC&amp;pg=PA43|year=1995|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-85285-125-5|pages=43–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Fawcett]] worked with Dilke and others in 1869 to set up an organisation, in response to Mill's call to action.&lt;ref name="Readman2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Readman|title=Land and Nation in England: Patriotism, National Identity, and the Politics of Land, 1880–1914|year=2008|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=978-0-86193-297-9|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members were [[Frederic Harrison]], [[John Morley]] and Alfred Russel Wallace.&lt;ref name="Nicholls1995"/&gt;

There were supporters in common of the [[First International]] (IWMA) and the LTRA, such as [[Joseph Lane (socialist)|Joseph Lane]] the socialist and [[William Randal Cremer]], as well as Lucraft and Odger.&lt;ref name="Morris2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Morris|title=The Collected Letters of William Morris, Volume II, Part A: 1881–1884|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qggABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA302|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5867-5|page=302 note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[G.

[[File:De Havilland Canada DHC-8-200 VH-LCL.jpg|thumb|LADS-equipped [[Bombardier Dash 8|de Havilland Canada Dash 8]] at [[Essendon Airport]] in Melbourne, Australia (2007)]]
The '''Laser airborne depth sounder''' (LADS) is an aircraft-based [[hydrographic surveying]] system used by the [[Australian Hydrographic Service]] (AHS).&lt;ref name=Slade171&gt;Slade, in Oldham, ''100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy'', p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; The system uses the difference between the sea surface and the sea floor as calculated from the aircraft's altitude to generate hydrographic data.&lt;ref name=Slade171/&gt;

The lack of progress made in surveying Australia's territorial waters, most of which was unsurveyed or relying on [[Age of Sail]]-era [[nautical chart|charts]] prompted the [[Royal Australian Navy]] to seek a method of effectively surveying large areas from the air in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="LADS-AHO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydro.gov.au/aboutus/lads.htm |title=LADS II (laser airborne depth sounder) |publisher=Australian Hydrographic Office |accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]] developed the LADS system, with feasibility trials beginning 1977.&lt;ref name=Slade171/&gt;&lt;ref name="LADS-AHO"/&gt;

The LADS system is built around a [[Nd:YAG laser]], which emits an infra-red beam at 990 [[hertz]].&lt;ref name="LADS-AHO"/&gt; The beam is [[Second-harmonic generation|frequency doubled]] to produce a green laser.&lt;ref name="LADS-AHO"/&gt; This is split into two beams, one infra-red, one green, by an [[optical coupler]], with the infra-red beam aimed directly below the aircraft, and the green beam directed across the target area with a [[scanning mirror]].&lt;ref name="LADS-AHO"/&gt; The infra-red laser does not penetrate the water's surface, and its reflected pulse indicates the height of the aircraft above the surface.&lt;ref name="LADS-AHO"/&gt; However, the green laser penetrates to the ocean floor, and the return pulse from the green laser indicates the height of the aircraft from the ocean floor; the difference between the two values is used to calculate the water's depth.&lt;ref name="LADS-AHO"/&gt; The data from the lasers is not processed aboard the aircraft, but instead by a ground support team, with aircraft flight data and [[global positioning system]] information used to help generate hydrographic readings.&lt;ref name="LADS-AHO"/&gt; The aircraft makes multiple, overlapping passes of the target area to ensure accurate data is collected.&lt;ref name="LADS-AHO"/&gt; The LADS system is capable of taking 990 [[depth sounding|soundings]] per second, with data points positioned {{convert|2|to|6|m}} apart across a swath up to {{convert|288|m}} wide.&lt;ref name="LADS-AHO"/&gt; The system is capable of working with waters up to {{convert|70|m}} deep, and can be modified to perform land surveys of areas with an altitude variance less than {{convert|50|m}}

LADS entered service with the AHS in 1993.&lt;ref name=Slade171/&gt; The equipment was initially fitted to a [[Fokker F27 Friendship]] aircraft.&lt;ref name=Slade171/&gt; In 2010, the system was installed in a [[Bombardier Dash 8|de Havilland Canada Dash 8]] aircraft.&lt;ref name=Slade171/&gt; This is operated by the [[Laser Airborne Depth Sounder Flight RAN|Laser Airborne Depth Sounder Flight]] of the [[Royal Australian Navy]].

'''Law enforcement''' is any system by which some members of [[society]] act in an organized manner to enforce the [[law]] by discovering, [[Deterrence (legal)|deterring]], [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitating]], or [[Punishment|punishing]] people who violate the rules and [[norm (social)|norm]]s governing that society.&lt;ref&gt;New Law Journal - Volume 123, Part 1 - Page 358, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term may encompass entities such as [[court]]s and [[prison]]s, it is most frequently applied to those who directly engage in patrols or surveillance to dissuade and discover [[crime|criminal]] activity, and those who investigate crimes and apprehend offenders,&lt;ref name="ILE"&gt;Kären M. Hess, Christine Hess Orthmann, ''Introduction to Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice'' (2008), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; a task typically carried out by the [[police]] or another [[law enforcement agency]]. Furthermore, although law enforcement may be most concerned with the prevention and punishment of [[crime]]s, organizations exist to discourage a wide variety of non-criminal violations of rules and norms, effected through the imposition of less severe consequences.

==Organizations==
{{Main|List of law enforcement agencies}}
Most law enforcement is conducted by some type of [[law enforcement agency]], with the most typical agency fulfilling this role being the [[police]]. Societal investment in enforcement through such organizations can be massive, both in terms of the resources invested in the activity, and in the number of people professionally engaged to perform those functions.&lt;ref name="ILE"/&gt;

Law enforcement agencies tend to be limited to operating within a specified [[jurisdiction]]. In some cases, jurisdiction may overlap inbetween organizations; for example, in the United States, each state has its own statewide law enforcement arms, but the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] is able to act against certain types of crimes occurring in any state. Various specialized segments of society may have their own internal law enforcement arrangements. For example, [[military]] organizations may have [[military police]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1958">'''Linkage''' was a [[foreign policy]] that was pursued by the [[United States]] and championed by [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Kissinger]] in the 1970s [[détente]], during the [[Cold War]]. The policy aimed to persuade the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China|Communist China]] to co-operate in restraining [[revolutions]] in the [[Third World]] in return for concessions in [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] and [[economics|economic]] fields. However, despite the lack of Soviet intervention, a large number of revolutions still occurred in Third World countries, thereby undermining the policy.
The premise behind linkage, as a policy, was to connect political and military issues, thereby establishing a relationship making progress in area "A" dependent on progress in area "B."

An important aspect of the policy was that deviations from respecting the rights and interests would go punished. The intent of the action was to bring home to the offending state the limitations of acceptable international behavior and demonstrate that attempts at expansion (and upsetting international stability) would go punished. Thus, conflict itself would contribute to stabilizing the international order.

The Nixon-Kissinger approach did not link foreign and domestic areas.

Selective relaxation of tensions is an opposing policy to linkage. In that case, an issue of arms control could be addressed and tension diminished, with the status quo being maintained in other strategic areas.

[[File:Ypourgeio Naftikon Greek Ministry of Naval Affairs document 1901 letterhead.jpg|thumb|Letterhead of the Ministry for Naval Affairs in 1901]]
The '''Ministry for Naval Affairs''' ({{lang-el|Ὑπουργείον [ἐπὶ] τῶν Ναυτικῶν}}) was a [[government department]] of [[Greece]] responsible for matters pertaining to the [[Greek Navy]] as well as the [[Greek Merchant Marine Ministry]].

The ministry was established in 1822, when the [[Provisional Administration of Greece]] was formed following the start of the [[Greek War of Independence]], with the name '''Ministry for Naval Affairs''' (Μινιστέριον των Ναυτικών). After the reorganization of the government under [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], and in the early years of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]]'s rule, it was known as the '''Secretariat of State for Naval Affairs''' (Γραμματεία τῆς Ἐπικρατείας ἐπὶ τῶν Ναυτικῶν), but after 1843 it was renamed to its eventual name (Ὑπουργείον ἐπὶ τῶν Ναυτικῶν, later simplified Ὑπουργείον τῶν Ναυτικῶν).

In 1936, the merchant marine section was split off to form an independent [[Greek Merchant Marine Ministry|Merchant Marine Ministry]], and the Ministry for Naval Affairs retained only its military responsibilities. In 1950, the [[Nikolaos Plastiras]] government established the [[Ministry of National Defence (Greece)|Ministry of National Defence]], to which the Ministry for Naval Affairs was subordinated as a Sub-Ministry (Ὑφυπουργείον τῶν Ναυτικῶν) until 1953, when the [[Alexandros Papagos]] government abolished the position.

==''History of the Thai Nation''==
Thailand's military junta was criticized for a history textbook it ordered written by the Fine Arts Department of the ministry. The book, ''History of the Thai Nation'',  claims that the military has established "true democracy" in Thailand and has eliminated corruption.&lt;ref name="AC-20180420"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai junta history book claims it established 'true democracy'|url=https://asiancorrespondent.com/2018/04/thai-history-book-lampooned-for-saying-military-junta-established-true-democracy/|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=Asian Correspondent|date=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015 the ministry's Fine Arts Department published ''History of the Thai Nation'' ({{lang-th|ประวัติศาสตร์ชาติไทย}}; {{rtgs|''prawat sat chat thai''}}) at the order of the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (NCPO).&lt;ref name=PTE-20180418&gt;{{cite news|title=New history textbook claims NCPO established true Thai democracy| url=https://prachatai.com/english/node/7716|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=Pratchatai English|date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCPO wanted a new history book covering the past 400 years to foster "national reconciliation". The book was written in two months.&lt;ref name="Nation-20180429"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phataranawik|first1=Phatarawadee|title=Writing and Rewriting History|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/big_read/30344212|accessdate=1 May 2018|work=The Nation|date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On page 195, the text reads, "Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha as Prime Minister has carried out a policy of reforming the country, reforming politics to be truly a democracy, eliminating corruption and using moral principles to lead the country to be truly a democracy."&lt;ref name=PTE-20180418/&gt; On page 197 it goes on to say, "After the coup d'etat, Gen Prayut became prime minister. He has tried to develop the country and reform Thai politics into a real democracy. Gen Prayut has used moral principles and stamped out corruption to return democracy to the country."&lt;ref name="BP-20180419"/&gt; The book maintains that the NCPO was forced to stage the 2014 coup to end the political chaos caused by the civilian government of the time. Ten thousand copies of the book were published at a cost of one million [[Thai baht|baht]]. Twenty copies autographed by Prayut were sold at the launch.&lt;ref name="Nation-20180429" /&gt; In November 2017, the prime minister ordered the Fine Arts Department to send 100 copies of the book to each of Thailand's provinces.&lt;ref name="BP-20180419"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kongrut|first1=Anchalee|title=Activist: 'Prayut as democracy hero' book a lie| url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1448146/activist-prayut-as-democracy-hero-book-a-lie|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leading critic of the junta charged that, "The content of the book is misleading and it will lead to the distortion of the country's history [if not corrected]."&lt;ref name="BP-20180419"/&gt; The culture ministry plans to translate the book to English for distribution to Thai embassies worldwide.&lt;ref name="Nation-20180429" /&gt;

'''Myron Ebell''' is the Director of Global Warming and International Environmental Policy at the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] (CEI), a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] advocacy group based in [[Washington, D.C.]] He is also the chairman of the [[Cooler Heads Coalition]], a loose coalition formed in 1997 which presents itself as "focused on dispelling the myths of global warming by exposing flawed economic, scientific, and risk analysis".&lt;ref name="DryzekNorgaard2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20161111" /&gt; 

In these organizations, Ebell has been central in promoting [[climate change denial]], distributing his views to the media and politicians.&lt;ref name="DryzekNorgaard2011" /&gt; Ebell, who is not a scientist,&lt;ref name="vanityfairaconvenientuntruth" /&gt; has been described as a climate change skeptic,&lt;ref name="trump picks top"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mufson Sep26, 16"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/09/26/trumps-transition-team-includes-a-major-skeptic-of-mainstream-climate-change-science/ |title=Trump's transition team has tapped a longtime climate skeptic to set environmental policy |last=Mufson |first=Steven |publisher=''The Washington Post'' |date=September 26, 2016 |accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a climate contrarian&lt;ref name="NYT-20161111"/&gt; and a climate change denier.&lt;ref name="CBS-20161111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NewsWeek 161014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greshko-20161109"&gt;{{cite news |last=Greshko |first=Michael |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/11/president-trump-global-climate-change-denial-environment/ |title=The Global Dangers of Trump's Climate Denial |work=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |date=November 9, 2016 |accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebell claims that he advocates "for sensible energy policies that benefit everyone. Instead of policies that simply reacts [sic] to alarmism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cei.org/expert/myron-ebell|title=Myron Ebell|date=2008-01-15|work=Competitive Enterprise Institute|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, Ebell was appointed by then [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Republican presidential candidate]] [[Donald Trump]] to lead his transition team for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref name="trump picks top"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-picks-top-climate-skeptic-to-lead-epa-transition/|title=Trump Picks Top Climate Skeptic to Lead EPA Transition| last=Bravender| first=Robin|publisher=ClimateWire/''Scientific American''|date=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early career==
Ebell grew up on a {{convert|2000|acre|ha|abbr=on}} cattle ranch at [[Baker City]], [[Oregon]], which was first homesteaded by the Ebells in the 1860s, and is still held by his relatives. In 1971 he went to [[Colorado College]], where he majored in philosophy and then obtained a master's degree in [[political science|political theory]] from the [[London School of Economics]]. Ebell undertook further postgraduate research at the [[University of California at San Diego]] and at [[Cambridge University]] before returning to the United States where he worked in a succession of public-policy jobs in Washington.&lt;ref name="NYT-20161111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vanityfairaconvenientuntruth"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/05/skeptic200705|title=A Convenient Untruth|date=May 2007|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|last1=Shnayerson|first1=Michael|accessdate=November 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="E&amp;E Transition"&gt;{{cite web | title=Transition: Who is Myron Ebell? | website=[[Environment &amp; Energy Publishing]]| date=November 21, 2016 | url=http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060046062 | accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1988 he bought a house in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]]. He worked as assistant to the chairman of the [[National Taxpayers Union]], and by 1990 he was a lobbyist representing the [[American Land Rights Association|National Inholders Association]], campaigning against federal policies which restricted property owners in [[List of national parks of the United States|U.S. national parks]] and [[United States National Forest|national forests]].&lt;ref name="E&amp;E Transition" /&gt; He worked for this organisation, which was renamed the American Land Rights Association (ALRA), on such policy topics as tobacco regulation and endangered species. In 1995 he sent a nine-page memo to staff at the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources]] opposing [[Newt Gingrich]]'s proposals to reform the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]] (ESA). Ebell wrote that Gingrich's "soft feelings for cuddly little critters is still going to be a big problem", and "We are going to need to get some of the freshmen and women to work on him." Ebell became a senior legislative assistant to Republican Representative [[John Shadegg]] and advocated the elimination of federal conservation regulations, leaving protection of the environment in the hands of state and local officials.&lt;ref name="Vinik 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Vinik | first=Danny | title=The Agenda: Trump's attack dog on climate | website=[[Politico]] | date=November 14, 2016 | url=http://politi.co/2fzOwQN | accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1995, he was hired as policy director of Senator [[Malcolm Wallop]]'s recently founded Frontiers of Freedom Institute. Wallop described Ebell as having "a broad background in public policy with a concentration on land use, environmental and tax policy. He is widely considered the key staff member responsible for and author of the "Shandegg" bill reform of the ESA."&lt;ref name="Industry Documents Library"&gt;{{cite web | title=Letter from Senator Malcolm Wallop to Samuel D.

== Political Views ==

=== Tobacco industry ===
In the 1990s, while serving as Policy Director at the Frontiers of Freedom Institute, Ebell worked as part of a team to make regulating the tobacco industry "politically unpalatable".&lt;ref name="Symons"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeremy-symons/meet-trumps-pick-to-disma_b_12832350.html|title=Meet Trump's Pick To Dismantle EPA|last=Symons|first=Jeremy|date=November 11, 2016|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011, as part of its "Control Abuse of Power" (CAP) project, the CEI launched lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the 1998 tobacco [[Master Settlement Agreement]] (MSA).&lt;ref&gt;[https://cei.org/blog/240-billion-tobacco-deal-challenged-supreme-court-sm-brands-v-caldwell $240 Billion Tobacco Deal Challenged in Supreme Court in S&amp;M Brands v. Caldwell]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kopel|first1=David|title=The Compact Clause vs. the Multistate Tobacco Cartel|url=http://volokh.com/2011/02/16/the-compact-clause-vs-the-multistate-tobacco-cartel/|website=The Volokh Conspiracy|accessdate=November 18, 2016|date=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global Warming ===
At a meeting on April 3, 1998, Ebell was one of 12 [[public relations]] experts and [[think-tank]] representatives who produced what they called their "Global Climate Science Communications" plan, with the aim of persuading "a majority of the American public" that "significant uncertainties exist in climate science", intending to convince the public and policymakers that the science was faulty and could be ignored. [[ExxonMobil]], the coal utility [[Southern Company]] and the [[American Petroleum Institute]] were represented at the meeting, and there were proposals for industry funding.&lt;ref name="Readfearn 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Readfearn | first=Graham | title=What happened to the lobbyists who tried to reshape the US view of climate change? | website=[[The Guardian]] | date=February 27, 2015 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/27/what-happened-to-lobbyists-who-tried-reshape-us-view-climate-change | accessdate=November 11, 2016}}, [https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1676446-global-climate-science-communications-plan-1998.html Global Climate Science Communications Plan 1998], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Ebell has been referred to as a "public-policy wonk—not, he hastens to clarify, a lobbyist for the energy industry, as many of his fellow skeptics are, or a scientist whose research is underwritten by the energy industry, or a politician who takes contributions from the energy industry."&lt;ref name="vanityfairaconvenientuntruth" /&gt;

After this meeting, ExxonMobil, even though aware as early as 1981 that fossil fuels affected climate change,&lt;ref name="TG-20150708"&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldenberg |first=Susanne |title=Exxon knew of climate change in 1981, email says – but it funded deniers for 27 more years |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-climate-change-1981-climate-denier-funding |date=July 8, 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=November 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20151105"&gt;{{cite news |last=Egan |first=Timothy |title=Exxon Mobil and the G.O.P.: Fossil Fools |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/opinion/fossil-fools.html |date=November 5, 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=November 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; began funding Frontiers of Freedom, where Ebell was a staff member. In 1999 Ebell transferred to the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] (CEI), and from 1998 to 2005 ExxonMobil provided CEI with over $2 million of funding.{{sfn | Union of Concerned Scientists | 2007|pp=11–13}} On October 27, 2006, Democratic senator [[Jay Rockefeller]] and Republican senator [[Olympia Snowe]] sent a joint [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] letter to [[Rex Tillerson]], the new CEO of ExxonMobil, about its funding of various groups, stating "We fervently hope that reports that ExxonMobil intends to end its funding of the climate change denial campaign of the Competitive Enterprise Institute are true."&lt;ref name="vanityfairaconvenientuntruth" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalcenter.org/ExxonMobilRockefellerSnowe102706.pdf Joint letter dated October 27, 2006], from senator [[Jay Rockefeller]] and senator [[Olympia Snowe]] to [[Rex Tillerson]], CEO of ExxonMobil&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Ebell said funding had no relevance as "We're not beholden to our donors, because we don't say, 'If you give us this money, we'll do this project'," and said "I can't even quite tell you who supports us on global warming". At that time, CEI had funding from the American Petroleum Institute, the [[Dow Chemical Company]], [[Eli Lilly and Company]], and William A. Dunn of Dunn Capital Management.&lt;ref name="vanityfairaconvenientuntruth" /&gt; During an August 2015 discussion on [[C-SPAN]], Ebell did not dispute the statement by Jeremy Symons of the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] (EDF) that CEI received funds from the [[Robert E. Murray|Murray Energy Corporation]] coal mining group. Ebell responded that his group's total budget of about $6 million was far smaller than that of EDF.&lt;ref name="NYT-20161111" /&gt;

Ebell has falsely claimed that "the rate of warming according to the data is much slower than the models used by the IPCC." Climate scientists note that past climate models have accurately predicted subsequent rates of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://climatefeedback.org/claimreview/on-bbc-newsnight-myron-ebell-falsely-claims-climate-models-exaggerate-warming/|title=On BBC Newsnight, Myron Ebell falsely claims climate models exaggerate warming|date=2018-10-09|work=Climate Feedback|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/ipcc-report-bbc-climate-change-denier-myron-ebell-bbc-newsnight-global-warming-a8575131.html |title=BBC condemned for inviting climate change denier to debate global warming report |work=The Independent |access-date=2018-12-03 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Clean Power Plan ====
Ebell has opposed the [[Clean Power Plan]] developed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The plan entailed far-reaching regulations that seek to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation especially by coal-burning power plants. The plan has been tied up in legal proceedings since it was finalized in 2015; Ebell argues that the plan is harmful to the economy and illegal.&lt;ref name="NYT-20161111" /&gt;

==== Paris Agreement ====
In September 2016, the ''[[Washington Times]]'' quoted Ebell as saying "Congress should prohibit any funding for the [[Paris Agreement|Paris Climate Agreement]], the [[Green Climate Fund]], and the underlying [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boyer|first1=Dave|title=Obama, Chinese president ratify climate-change agreement|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/3/obama-xi-ratify-climate-change-agreement/|accessdate=November 18, 2016|work=The Washington Times|date=September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="defund Paris"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebell |first=Myron |url=https://cei.org/content/obama-chinese-president-ratify-climate-change-agreement |title=Obama, Chinese president ratify climate-change agreement |work=Washington Times |publisher=CEI |date=September 3, 2016 |accessdate=November 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental Protection Agency and George W. Bush====
The first [[National Climate Assessment]] was prepared over several years. ExxonMobil did not participate in public consultations, but on August 10, 2000, ran an advertisement in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' raising various objections to a draft. The report was delivered to Congress in November 2000.{{sfn | Union of Concerned Scientists | 2007|p=21}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://insideclimatenews.org/sites/default/files/documents/MacCracken%20Letter%20to%20Exxon%20%282002%29.pdf RE: With regard to the ExxonMobil facsimile on February 6, 2001], letter of September 26, 2002, from [[Michael MacCracken]], Office of the U. S. Global Change Research Program, to [[Lee Raymond]] of ExxonMobil.&lt;/ref&gt; The incoming [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]] appointed moderate Republican [[Christine Todd Whitman]] as chair of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), and American Petroleum Institute lobbyist [[Philip Cooney]] as chief of staff of the [[Council on Environmental Quality]] (CEQ).&lt;ref name="Mann HCW"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Michael E. |title=The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines |isbn=0-231-52638-5 |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2013 |pp=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the campaign, Bush had promised to cap carbon dioxide emissions. Shortly after the inauguration Ebell heard a rumor that Bush was going to repeat the pledge in a speech. Ebell contacted [[Robert Novak]] who was due to interview Whitman, and Novak questioned her on CNN's ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]''. It became a hot topic, and CEI circulated it to anyone with influence. Bush dropped the pledge, and in March withdrew from the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref name="Begley"&gt;{{cite web |last=Begley|first=Sharon|authorlink=Sharon Begley | url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/32482 | title=The Truth About Denial | publisher=''[[Newsweek]]'' | date=August 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820002929/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20122975/site/newsweek/page/0/|archivedate=August 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with the "Global Climate Science Communications" plan to [[Manufactured controversy|manufacture uncertainty]], Cooney edited the EPA's 2002 [[US Climate Action Report]] before sending it to the UN in May, but on June 3, 2002, the ''New York Times'' headlined its story "U.S. Sees Problems In Climate Change", saying in a "stark shift" the administration "for the first time mostly blames human actions for recent global warming".&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Revkin 2002"&gt;{{cite web | last=Revkin | first=Andrew C. | title=U.S. Sees Problems In Climate Change | website=The New York Times | date=June 3, 2002 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/03/us/us-sees-problems-in-climate-change.html | accessdate=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, Cooney contacted Ebell, who emailed back "I know you're in crisis mode", and advised "what we can do is limited until there is an official statement from the administration repudiating the report". On June 4 Bush dismissed the report as something "put out by the bureaucracy", and said policy was unchanged.&lt;ref name="Dickinson 2007"&gt;{{cite web | last=Dickinson | first=Tim | title=Six Years of Deceit | website=Rolling Stone | date=June 28, 2007 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/six-years-of-deceit-20070628 | accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebell had said in his email that "the folks at EPA are the obvious fall guys", to be tackled "high up as possible". He had already given several interviews "blaming EPA for freelancing", and "Perhaps tomorrow we will call for Whitman to be fired." She eventually resigned the EPA chair in May 2003.{{sfn | Union of Concerned Scientists | 2007|pp=21–22, 57}}

The recently introduced [[Data Quality Act]] had already been used by industry to suppress scientific information, and on August 6, 2003, the CEI sued the Bush administration's [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] under the Act, demanding that it should invalidate the National Assessment as allegedly inaccurate, biased and not based on "sound science", and should also invalidate the Climate Action Report which was based on the Assessment. The attorneys general of Maine and Connecticut obtained documents including Ebell's June 2002 email through a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request. On August 11, they asked the U.S. Justice Department under [[John Ashcroft]] to investigate – Connecticut Attorney General [[Richard Blumenthal]] said the email "indicates a secret initiative by the administration to invite and orchestrate a lawsuit against itself to discredit an official United States government report on global warming dangers", which could be improper and possibly illegal;&lt;ref name="Vanderheiden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mann 110, 297"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Mann |first1= Michael E. |authorlink=Michael E.

Steven Rowe]] as attorney general of Maine said "The idea that the Bush administration may have invited a lawsuit from a special interest group in order to undermine the federal government's own work under an international treaty is very troubling."{{sfn | Union of Concerned Scientists | 2007|p=22}}&lt;ref name="Vanderheiden"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vanderheiden|first1=Steve|title=Atmospheric Justice: A Political Theory of Climate Change|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199733125|pages=42–43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIEVDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|language=en|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 August, Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] wrote to the White House expressing hope that the lawsuit was "not the result of a collusive plan conceived by the CEI in concert with the Administration, itself. It would be wrong in any circumstances to reject the well founded findings of the [Climate Action Report], but for the Administration to use an outside group to pursue such an ill-conceived goal would be doubly wrong, and could also be abuse of the courts at the expense of the taxpayers." Ashcroft turned down the request for an investigation. On November 4, 2003, the CEI's lawsuit was dismissed by the court, [[with prejudice]] so that it could not be re-filed.&lt;ref name="Mann 110, 297" /&gt;{{sfn | Union of Concerned Scientists | 2007|p=22}}

====Media coverage====
Ebell has been given extensive media coverage, frequently cited or interviewed by journalists in a way that presents a [[false balance]] by giving Ebell's lay views equal weight with those of expert climatologists, and thus misrepresents the consensus of [[scientific opinion on climate change]].&lt;ref name="vanityfairaconvenientuntruth" /&gt; A study of false equivalence in the media used as an example the [[E. W.

In an interview on [[BBC Radio 4]] in 2005, Ebell said that the UK's Chief Scientist [[David King (scientist)|David King]] was "an alarmist with ridiculous views who knows nothing about climate change".&lt;ref name="Antilla 2005 pp. 338–352" /&gt; An [[early day motion]] deploring "in the strongest possible terms" Ebell's "unfounded and insulting criticism" was raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], and was signed by 66 [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Early Day Motions 1970"&gt;{{cite web | title=Us Government And Climate Change (EDM1881) | website=Early Day Motions | date=January 17, 1970 | url=http://www.edms.org.uk/2003-04/1881.htm | accessdate=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bravender|first1=Robin|title=Trump Picks Top Climate Skeptic to Lead EPA Transition|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-picks-top-climate-skeptic-to-lead-epa-transition/|accessdate=November 18, 2016|work=Scientific American|date=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, CEI arranged a public-service television commercial about [[carbon dioxide]] with the slogan "They call it pollution; we call it life."&lt;ref name="vanityfairaconvenientuntruth" /&gt;  Also in 2006, Ebell wrote an article in ''Forbes'' titled "Love Global Warming". In the article, Ebell wrote, "More people die from blizzards and cold spells than from heat waves. Increased death rates usually persist for weeks after the unusually cold temperatures have passed, which suggests that the cold is killing people who would otherwise live into another season at least. Mortality rates during heat waves are just the reverse. The increase ends and often the rate drops below normal as soon as temperatures cool, which suggests that the higher temperatures are killing people who are likely to die soon anyway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2006/1225/038.html| title=Love Global Warming|author=Myron Ebell|date=December 8, 2006|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 discussion with [[Michael Shnayerson]], Ebell criticized [[James Hansen]]'s writings on [[Effects of climate change on terrestrial animals|climatic effects on animals]] by saying "James Hansen was not trained as a climate scientist", instead "He was trained as an astronomer. He's a physicist" and "you know from him talking about species' going north, he knows nothing about biology." Ebell similarly argued that [[Robert Corell]] "is not a climate scientist" and "not an Arctic expert"; Corell told Shnayerson that his Arctic research visits began in 1968. Ebell has no scientific training, and told Shnayerson that, when asked about scientific topics in interviews, he would say "I'm not a climate scientist. I'm just giving you the informed layman's perspective". His view is that "If science is going to be discussed in the public arena, then shouldn't people other than scientists be allowed to participate? Isn't that what a representative democracy is?"&lt;ref name="vanityfairaconvenientuntruth" /&gt;

Through CEI, Ebell has stated his belief that [[global warming]] is a hoax,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Biesecker |first=Michael |last2=Horwitz |first2=Jeff |last3=Salama |first3=Vivian |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-transition-packed-washington-insiders-lobbyists-43486143 |title=Trump Relies on Washington Insiders to Build Administration |work=Associated Press |publisher=ABC News |date=November 12, 2016 |accessdate=November 15, 2016 |quote=Trump }}&lt;/ref&gt; that most of the data predicting climate change is false,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lindenberger |first=Hudson |url=http://www.mensjournal.com/adventure/articles/trump-versus-the-planet-the-transition-teams-environmental-agenda-w450246 |title=Trump Versus the Planet: The Transition Team's Environmental Agenda |work=Men's Journal |date=2016 |accessdate=November 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the scientific consensus was "phony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mack |first=Eric |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2016/11/11/donald-trump-says-climate-change-is-a-hoax-lets-discuss/#33c82e171d50 |title=Let's Discuss Climate Change In Donald Trump's America; Trolls Welcome |work=Forbes |date=November 11, 2016 |accessdate=November 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 a Climatic Research Unit computer server at the University of East Anglia [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy|was hacked]] and thousands of emails and computer files were uploaded to a Russian server. Ebell said the hacked emails "make it clear that the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is an organized conspiracy dedicated to tricking the world into believing that global warming is a crisis that requires a drastic response."&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Morello. [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/second-batch-of-stolen-climategate-messages-emerges/ Second Batch of Stolen "Climategate" Messages Emerges], ''Scientific American'', November 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmentalists===
Ebell has stated that environmentalists believe "humans are evil, the use of human power is always bad; everything we do to nature is bad."&lt;ref name="McQuaig"&gt;{{cite book | last = McQuaig | first = Linda | title = War, Big Oil and the Fight for the Planet: It's the Crude, Dude | publisher = Doubleday Canada | year = 2011 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GUbjEHsJ2a0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages = 38, 39| isbn = 9780385672160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebell views forced energy conservation as an infringement on American rights; he has stated: "Energy is fundamental to mobility, to comfort.  When you start limiting people's access to energy, you limit their ability to live the way they want, to make choices."&lt;ref name="McQuaig"/&gt;

Ebell compared his efforts and those of his colleagues to a "David versus Goliath struggle" against "corrupt environmentalism and big government", and has said that the "environmental movement is not an objective, well-intentioned movement that cares about saving the planet", but one which emerged from the [[New Left]], and which always proposes the same solutions regardless of the issue: lower material standards of living, more government control, and more power for the technocratic elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Marshall | first =  George | title = Don't Even Think About It: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Ignore Climate Change | publisher = Bloomsbury | year = 2014 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yz4kAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages = 37| isbn =  9781620401347 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebell claims that environmental groups started out as "well intentioned groups" but now the groups have turned into a "huge, power-hungry industry" that "made a tremendous mistake when they stopped being concerned about the environment and got onto the global warming bandwagon."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2017/09/02/theres-a-strong-moral-case-for-energy-abundance-heres-why-video/|title=There’s A ‘Strong Moral Case For Energy Abundance.’ Here’s Why [VIDEO]|website=The Daily Caller|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Endangered Species Act ===
In opposing a 2005 update, Ebell said that the [[Endangered Species Act]] unfairly infringes on land owners' property rights, as well as undermining the protection of rare species by encouraging land owners to make their property inhospitable to such species in order to escape regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cei.org/pdf/4530.pdf|title=An Update on Endangered Species Act Reform|date=April 2005|publisher=[[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC)l|format=PDF|author=Myron Ebell|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dyke|first1=Fred Van|title=Conservation Biology: Foundations, Concepts, Applications|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402068904|pages=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Evh1UD3ZYWcC&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=November 18, 2016|language=en|date=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebell stated in an interview that the CEI is "adamantly opposed" to the Endangered Species Act, and that they are working on it in a limited way now because they could not attract funding.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.odlt.org/dcd/docs/mooney_some.pdf Some Like It Hot]" (PDF) Chris Mooney, ''Mother Jones'' May/June 2005 issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trump Environmental Protection Agency transition team==
In September 2016, Ebell was appointed by then [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Republican presidential candidate]] [[Donald Trump]] to lead his transition team for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref name="trump picks top"/&gt; As of January 27, 2017, he was described as the former head of the transition team.&lt;ref&gt;http://time.com/4651407/trump-wants-to-slash-the-epas-workforce-and-budget-transition-official-says/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Liberation Movement''' ({{lang-es|Movimiento de Liberación Nacional}}, '''MLN''') was a [[Guatemala]]n [[political party]] formed in 1954 by [[Carlos Castillo Armas]]. The party served as political platform for the [[military junta]].

==History==
The MLN was founded as '''National Democratic Movement''' ({{lang-es|Movimiento Democratico Nacional}}, MDN) in 1954 by President [[Carlos Castillo Armas]]. It was the ruling party from 1954 until 1958. The party supported the government of President [[Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes]] (1958-1963).&lt;ref name="Ameringer"&gt;Charles D. Ameringer, ''Political Parties of the Americas, 1980s to 1990s: Canada, Latin America, and the West Indies'', 1992. Pp. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1963 coup that saw the government of Ydígoras Fuentes overthrown led to the MLN becoming the main party of the military. Although they were not successful in the presidential election of 1964 their candidate in 1970, [[Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio]], was elected [[President of Guatemala|President]], in coalition with the [[Institutional Democratic Party]]. Victory was also secured in the [[Guatemalan general election, 1974|1974 election]] when [[Kjell Eugenio Laugerud García]]'s candidacy was also endorsed by the PID. However they later broke their alliance with the PID for the [[Guatemalan general election, 1978|1978 elections]]. Its candidate, former President [[Enrique Peralta Azurdia]], placed second in the election.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Janda, [http://janda.org/icpp/ICPP1980/Book/PART2/4-CentralAmerica/44-Guatemala/Guatemala.htm 'GUATEMALA: The Party System in 1950-1954 and 1953-1962']&lt;/ref&gt; The party was close to the [[MANO]] [[death squad]]. Another faction of the party, the [[National Reformist Movement]], split away after the coup although it never became a major factor in electoral politics.&lt;ref name="Ameringer"/&gt;

In the [[Guatemalan general election, 1982|1982 election]], the MLN's candidate was former vice-president [[Mario Sandoval Alarcón]], who placed second in what was considered a fraudulent election, followed by a [[coup d'état]] in 1982. For the 1984 elections to the [[Guatemalan Constitutional Assembly election, 1984|Constitutional Assembly]], the party allied with National Authentic Central, another right-wing party, and the 23 seats they won constituted the largest bloc in the assembly, albeit outnumbered by reformist parties. They renewed their alliance with the Institutional Democratic Party for the [[Guatemalan general election, 1985|1985 election]]. Once more, Mario Sandoval Alarcón was its presidential candidate, and placed fourth in the race while the alliance won 12 seats in Congress. The party faded thereafter: it ran alongside the [[National Advancement Front]] in [[Guatemalan general election, 1990|1990]] without much success, winning just 4 seats in Congress. Left to continue alone, it secured less than 1% in 1995 (winning a single seat) and again in  1999 (when it lost representation).&lt;ref&gt;Daniel M. Corstange, [http://janda.org/icpp/ICPP2000/Countries/4-CentralAmerica/44-Guatemala/Guatemala63-00.html 'The Party System from 1963 to 2000']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On the Poverty of Student Life: A Consideration of Its Economic, Political, Sexual, Psychological and Notably Intellectual Aspects and of a Few Ways to Cure it''''' ({{lang-fr|De la misère en milieu étudiant considérée sous ses aspects économique, politique, psychologique, sexuel et notamment intellectuel et de quelques moyens pour y remédier}}) is a [[pamphlet]] first published by students of the [[University of Strasbourg]] and the [[Situationist International]] (SI) in 1966.&lt;ref name=beach/&gt; Attacking the subservience of university students and the strategies of student radicals, it caused significant uproar, led to the dissemination of Situationist ideas, and precipitated the events of [[May 1968 in France]].

== Background and publication ==
Taking advantage of the apathy of their colleagues, five "Pro-situs", Situationist-influenced students had been elected to the University of Strasbourg's [[students' union]] in November 1966 and began scandalising the authorities.&lt;ref name=tmrg/&gt;&lt;ref name=vague/&gt; Their first action was to form an "anarchist appreciation society" called The Society for the Rehabilitation for Karl Marx and Ravachol; next they appropriated union funds to [[Flyposting|flypost]] "Return of the Durruti Column", André Bertrand's ''[[détournement|détourned]]'' comic strip.&lt;ref name=vague/&gt; They then invited the Situationists to contribute a critique of the University of Strasbourg, and ''On the Poverty of Student Life'', written by Tunisian Situationist Mustapha/Omar Khayati was the result.&lt;ref name=vague/&gt;

The students promptly proceeded to print 10,000 copies of the pamphlet using university funds and distributed them during a ceremony marking the beginning of the academic year. This provoked an immediate outcry in the local, national and international media.&lt;ref name=vague/&gt; The students responsible were expelled and the student union closed under court order.&lt;ref name=beach/&gt;&lt;ref name=vague/&gt; The scandal significantly raised the profile of the SI&lt;ref name=crit/&gt; and led them to reappraise the revolutionary potential of academia, reversing their previous disillusionment to take seats on the [[Occupation Committee of the Sorbonne]] during May 1968.&lt;ref name=sadler/&gt; ''On the Poverty of Student Life'' was a key text for the French and German students who rebelled in 1968.&lt;ref name=newstatesman/&gt;

== Content and reception ==
{{Situationists}}
The text displayed an advanced understanding of Situationist concepts and tactics.&lt;ref name=crit/&gt; It provoked the students of the university by confronting them with their subservience to the ideological conditions imposed upon them by the state, family and the university system.&lt;ref name=vague/&gt; The pamphlet alleged that the students fled from this reality to take refuge in miserabilism and [[bohemianism]].&lt;ref name=medio/&gt; It also criticised radical student collectives including the [[Provo (movement)|Provos]] (Netherlands), [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of One Hundred]] (United Kingdom) and those of [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley, California]] (United States) for fighting specific issues such as nuclear arms, racism and censorship rather than the system at large, praising only [[Spies for Peace]].&lt;ref name=vague/&gt;

The title of the pamphlet induced fury in the [[Paris]]ian cafés in the Spring of 1967.&lt;ref name=medio/&gt; The pamphlet was described by a local newspaper shortly after its release as "the first concrete manifestation of a revolt aiming quite openly at the destruction of society".&lt;ref name=tmrg/&gt; Critic [[Greil Marcus]] characterised the pamphlet as a [[polemic]] in his history of 20th century avant-garde art movements ''[[Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the 20th Century|Lipstick Traces]]'' (1990).&lt;ref name=lipstick/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3269">A '''permanent representative''' is a [[diplomat]] who is the head of a country’s [[diplomatic mission]] to an [[international organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/5_1_1975.pdf |title=Vienna Convention on the Representation of States in their Relations with International Organizations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=1975 |website=UN Office of Legal Affairs |publisher=United Nations|access-date=September 27, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Organizations that receive permanent representatives from their member states include the [[United Nations Permanent Representative|United Nations]], the [[World Trade Organization]], [[NATO]], the [[European Union]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], and the [[Organization of American States]]. Permanent representatives can be sent to subunits or field offices of an organization. For example, in addition to the permanent representatives sent to the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations headquarters]] in [[New York City]], UN member states also appoint permanent representatives to other UN offices, such as those in [[United Nations Office at Geneva|Geneva]], [[United Nations Office at Nairobi|Nairobi]], and [[United Nations Office at Vienna|Vienna]].

Permanent representatives are often informally described as ''[[ambassadors]]''.&lt;ref name=berridge&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berridge |first1=G.R. |last2=Lloyd |first2=Lorna |date=2012 |title=The Palgrave Macmillan Dictionary of Diplomacy, Third Edition |url= |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page= |isbn=978-0-230-30299-0 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although a permanent representative typically holds the [[diplomatic rank]] of an ambassador, because he or she is accredited to an international organisation the official title is permanent representative.&lt;ref name=berridge/&gt; For example, the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] is technically called the Permanent Representative to the UN, even though he or she is widely referred to as an ambassador. 

Diplomatic representatives of the Pope are titled [[Papal diplomacy|apostolic nuncio or papal nuncio]], which is equivalent to permanent representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11160a.htm |title=Nuncio |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=New Advent |access-date=September 27, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some international organizations, such as [[UNESCO]], use the title '''permanent delegate''' to refer to the head of a diplomatic mission accredited to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/eri/permdel/protocollist_photos.asp?language=E |title=Directory of Permanent Delegations and Permanent Observer Missions to UNESCO  |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website= |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=September 27, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Power Down: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World''''' ({{ISBN|978-0865715103}}) is a 2004 [[book]] by [[Richard Heinberg]] in which Heinberg discusses [[peak oil]] and its attendant implications for the [[global economy]]. Due to the dependence of [[industrialized society]] on cheap and readily available [[petroleum]] ([[fossil fuel]] [[oil]]), Heinberg argues that the post-peak period of global history is likely to be characterized by social and economic turmoil, disruption of trade, declining [[standard of living]], and warfare.

Heinberg outlines four possible strategies nations could employ to respond to the economic challenges associated with declining [[oil production]]:

* '''Last One Standing:''' Global competition for remaining [[resources]]
* '''Powerdown:''' Global cooperation in reducing energy usage, conservation, [[resource management]], and reducing population
* '''[[Denial]]:''' Waiting, and hoping that some unforeseen element will solve the problem
* '''Building Lifeboats:''' Preparing local areas to be [[sustainable]] in the event that the global economic project collapses

Heinberg fleshes out each of these strategies in detail and describes the current [[political]] and [[economic]] environment in terms of these elements.

'''Realists''' ({{lang-cs|Realisté}}) is a conservative party based in the Czech Republic. It was founded by [[Petr Robejšek]] in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Politolog Robejšek zakládá stranu. Ve volbách chce 20 procent|url=http://www.denik.cz/z_domova/politolog-robejsek-zalozil-konzervativni-stranu-realiste2-20161124.html|website=Deník.cz|accessdate=24 November 2016|date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members include Pavel Kohout, Antonín Fryč and Jiří Horecký. Robejšek stated that the party aims to succeed in the [[Czech legislative election, 2017|2017 legislative election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robejšek oznámil vznik Realistů, chce se obětovat pro blaho národa|url=https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/421595-robejsek-oznamil-vznik-realistu-chce-se-obetovat-pro-blaho-naroda.html|website=Novinky.cz|accessdate=24 November 2016|language=cs-CZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party said that it will defend Czech national interests and govern according to the [[Pareto principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kritik EU politolog Robejšek zakládá novou stranu.

==History==
The party was established on 24 November 2016. Petr Robejšek took the title of "mentor", because the new leader was to be elected in 2016. The Realists criticised [[ANO 2011]], which they called a "left leaning" party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robejšek má novou stranu.

The party is ideologically close to the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] and [[Dawn - National Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vzniká nová politická strana Realisté, oznámil politolog Robejšek.

The Realists launched their campaign for [[Czech legislative election, 2017|the 2017 elections]] on 14 February 2017. Robejšek said that he hoped to win 20% of votes in the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robejšek odstartoval kampaň, chce získat dvacet procent hlasů|url=https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/429355-robejsek-odstartoval-kampan-chce-ziskat-dvacet-procent-hlasu.html|website=Novinky.cz|accessdate=14 February 2017|language=cs-CZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Lank, who was elected as a member of [[Dawn - National Coalition|Dawn of Direct Democracy]], joined the Realists on 25 May 2017.&lt;ref name="Robejškovi Realisté mají prvního poslance.

On 21 August 2017, the Realists announced [[Jiří Hynek]] as their presidential candidate in the [[Czech presidential election, 2018|2018 election]].

The Realists received 0.7% of votes in the 2017 legislative election, failing to reach the 5% electoral threshold.&lt;ref name="Kdo pohořel?

The '''Red Strings''' (also '''Heroes of America''') were a group in the [[Southern United States]] during the [[American Civil War]]. They favored peace, an end to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], and a return to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. They began early in the war as a group of [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionists]] and [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]]s in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] regions of [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] where [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was largely nonexistent and the causes favoring secession were weakest.

== Origin ==
With the war weariness increasing in civilian parts of the Confederacy during 1863, pro-Union activities began to become organized as resistance. The Loyal Order of the Heroes of America were started by several men from North Carolina, including Henderson Adams, North Carolina's State Auditor during this time. The actual leader was [[John Pool]], later a Republican Senator from North Carolina, who spent some time in a jail in Richmond, and who traveled through western Virginia in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Turk, David S. The Union Hole: Unionist Activity and Local Conflict in Western Virginia. Bowie, MD: Heritage Books, 1994. Pages 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their name comes from their insignia of red strings worn on their lapels or hung outside of their windows to distinguish themselves from the rebels. This symbol comes from the Biblical story of the harlot [[Rahab]], who had helped two spies of Israel escape from Jericho with a red cord, and was advised by them to hang a red thread on her window as a recognition symbol and to show her faith. [[Joshua]], Chapter 2, Verses 18, 21, and Chapter 6, verse 23: "..thou shalt bind this line of scarlet in the window which thou didst let us down by... ...and she bound the scarlet line in the window... ...And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had. And she dwellest in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers that Joshua sent to spy out [[Jericho]]."

The organization was completely decentralized, and most knew only one other member for certain; most of their anti-Confederate activities were carried out in secret. Some estimate that by the war's end, as many as 10,000 people belonged to the Red Strings. They were comparably as disruptive to the Southern war effort as the [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]] were to the Union.

==Activities==
"The best developed of the peace societies, the Order of the Heroes of America, may have been organized as early as Dec. 1861, though by whom and where is uncertain. Active in [[North Carolina]], southwestern [[Virginia]], and eastern [[Tennessee]], the Heroes protected deserters, aided spies and escaped prisoners, and supplied Federal authorities with information about Confederate troop movements and strength to bring about a Confederate defeat. Brig. Gen. [[John Echols]], who investigated the order in Virginia when it was discovered there in 1864, believed it had been formed at the suggestion of Federal authorities. Union civilian and military officials cooperated with the order by assuring its members safe passage through the lines and by offering them exemption from military service if they deserted, protection for their property, and a share of confiscated Confederate estates after the war. In addition to their signs and passwords, the Heroes identified themselves by wearing a red string on their lapels and thus were nicknamed the Red Strings" and the 'Red-String Band.'"&lt;ref&gt;"Historical Time Encyclopedia Of The Civil War" Edited by Patricia L. Faust.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Order of the Heroes of America extended into southwestern Virginia as well. [[Paint Bank, Virginia]] was known as a Union-Hole because of the pro-Union membership in these societies. One of the members of the Order was a [[Christiansburg, Virginia]] wheelwright named Williams. It is not known if this is the same man named Williams that residents of [[Back Valley, Virginia]] spoke about as a member of the [[Loyal League]].&lt;ref&gt;Turk, David S. The Union Hole: Unionist Activity and Local Conflict in Western Virginia. Bowie, MD: Heritage Books, 1994. Pages 83-84. The author is also quoting from the "Report of Detectives," October 10, 1864, published in the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, Series IV, Volume 3, page 807.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the organized opposition groups such as the Red Strings and Heroes of America, there were other groups that were closer to bandits. Known as "Buffaloes," these men and some women were a mixture of Confederate deserters, draft-dodgers, pro-Union men, escaped slaves and other men escaping the noose such as arsonists, rapists and murderers. Living in small groups in the swamps of eastern North Carolina or the woods of the central and western parts of that state, they attacked isolated homes, often with impunity, since many of the men were away at war, and there was no protection from their lawlessness. "The correspondents in the war records seem unaware that North Carolina, like all Gaul, was divided into three parts- the Confederate, the Yankee and the Buffalo. It was easier to let the Yankee garrison the strip of coast and keep him there than have the expense of it ourselves, but it is amusing to read of "The Rebels Invading North Carolina."&lt;ref&gt;Carolina and the Southern Cross. Volume 1 (9), November 1913, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Red Strings" were also interested in forming blacks into soldiers and having them fight for the Union as well. There are miscellaneous accounts of these black companies being formed during the war, as are mentioned in Elizabeth Lee Battle's autobiography, "Forget-Me-Nots of the Civil War."&lt;ref&gt;Forget-Me-Nots of the Civil War. Chapters 13, "Bummers and Red Strings," and chapter 14, "Ku Klux Klan," pages 165-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, they actively opposed the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. "One of the main causes for the organization of the Ku Klux Klan in North Carolina was to combat the influence of the [[Union League]]. Governor [[William Woods Holden]] was the first president of the League in North Carolina, and [[James H. Harris]], a Negro, was Vice-president. " Prof. Lefler later recounts: "If there had been no [[Loyal League]] in North Carolina, there would have been no Ku Klux Klan, or clubbing together of the white people there… Still the negroes [sic] operate upon each other, so that one dare not depart from the ranks; they are arrayed yet in a solid phalanx…" He later quotes from a Congressional investigation into the origins of the KKK in North Carolina: "It was at a time when the Republican party had three secret organizations in operation in the state, the [[Union League]], the Heroes of America, and the Red Strings. They had a paper called the Red String, printed at Greensorough [sic], edited by Mr. Tourgee ([[Albion W. Tourgée]]).  Our friends thought it proper to organize a secret society for the purpose of counteracting that influence.- Ku Klux reports, North Carolina Testimony, pp. 8, 309-310, 318, 363."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh T. Lefler]]. "The Red Strings and the Union League in North Carolina." In: North Carolina History Told by Contemporaries. Chapel Hill: UNC Press. 1934. Page 318-321. Also pages 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red Strings Baseball Team==
The term "Red Strings" became popular among different groups after the war. Indeed, during the next generation, there was an exceptional baseball team formed in [[Yadkin County]] with the name, "Red Strings." They only lost three games out of some sixty games that they played in their brief career. Many of the players were trained in [[Quaker]] schools, although they denied any relation to the "Red Strings" of the Civil War. "How the name Red Strings originated is not known definitely. Members think Captain Gus Long, organizer and manager, gave the name… Elkin-ites didn't like the name Red Strings- too much like night riding political group about this time, the Red Shirts, reminiscent of the earlier [[Ku Klux Klan]]. They preferred to call them the Longtown boys."&lt;ref&gt;Dunnagan, Macon Rush. Red Strings Baseball Team of Yadkin County, N.C. 1896-1902. New Bern, N.C.: Owen G. Dunn, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red String Conspiracy==
It is unknown if an earlier Southern conspiracy with a similar name, also organized by slaves and indentured servants, that took place in Georgia in the 18th century had any influence or association with the later Red Strings. In 1735 and 1736, a conspiracy among indentured servants was quashed in [[Savannah, Georgia]] and in [[South Carolina]]. The servants would be known "by a red string tied around their right wrist" and they would kill the white masters and escape to join Native Americans, escaped slaves and other runaway indentured servants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Linebaugh]], [[Marcus Rediker]]. 2000.

'''River crab''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|河|蟹}}|p={{linktext|hé|xiè}}}}) and '''harmonious/harmonize/harmonization''' ({{zh| links=no|c={{linktext|和|谐}}|p={{linktext|hé|xié}}}}) are [[Internet slang]] terms created by [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[netizen]]s in reference to [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|Internet censorship]] or the other [[Censorship in the People's Republic of China|censorship]] of China. In [[Standard Mandarin|Chinese Mandarin]], the word "river crab" (河蟹), which originally means [[Chinese mitten crab]], [[Homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese|sounds similar]] to "harmonious/harmonize/harmonization" ({{zh| links=no|c=和谐}}) in the word "[[harmonious society]]" (和谐社会), ex-Chinese leader [[Hu Jintao]]'s signature ideology.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/world/asia/12beast.html?em|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|author=Michael Wines|title=A Dirty Pun Tweaks China’s Online Censors |date=2009-03-11|accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
The 2004 [[Chinese Communist Party]] announcement of the goal of constructing a "harmonious society" has been cited by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|government of China]] as the reason for Internet censorship. As a result, Chinese netizens began to use the word "harmonious/harmonize/harmonization" (和谐) as a euphemism for censorship when the word for censorship itself was censored, particularly on [[bulletin board system|BBSs]]. Following this, the word "harmonious" itself was censored, at which point Chinese netizens began to use the word for "river crab", a [[Homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese|near homophone]] for "harmonious". In a further complication of meaning, sometimes '''aquatic product''' ({{zh| links=no|c={{linktext|水|产}}}}) is used in place of "river crab". 

These euphemisms are also used as verbs. For example, instead of saying something has been censored, one might say "it has been harmonized" ({{zh| c=被和谐了}}) or "it has been river-crabbed" ({{zh| c=被河蟹了}}).  The widespread use of "river crab" by Chinese netizens represents a sarcastic defiance against official discourse and censorship. Some observers, however, have warned that the practice may also reproduce domination, since it does not aim for the abolition of censorship. The sensitive words will remain silent as such, and as a result the everyday reappropriation of official language creates the conditions for the latter's perpetuation.&lt;ref&gt;Nordin, Astrid and Richud, Lisa (2014), "Subverting official language and discourse in China? Type river crab for harmony," China Information 28, 1 (March): 47-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known picture usually named ''River crab society, three wearing watches'' (河蟹社会，三个戴表) illustrates the slang "river crab". In the picture, the three wristwatches refer to the [[Three Represents]], where the Mandarin expressions used for "represent" ({{zh
|c=代表
|p=dàibiǎo}}) and "Wearing watch(es)" ({{zh
|s=戴表
|t=戴錶
|p=dài biǎo }}) are [[homophone]]s. The satirized homophone of the three watches might be created by Chinese writer Wang Xiaofeng ([[:zh:王小峰|王小峰]]), whose online nickname is "Wearing three watches" (戴三个表). An offensive term "foolish bitch" ({{zh
|c=呆婊
|p=dāi biǎo }}) is also used by anti-Communist Chinese people.

'''Sheila McNamee'''  is an American academic known for her work in human communication and [[social constructionism]] theory and practice.  She is a Professor of Communication at the [[University of New Hampshire]] and founding member, Vice President and board member of the [[Taos Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/sheila-mcnamee--phd |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130222085521/http://www.taosinstitute.net/sheila-mcnamee--phd |archivedate=2013-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has authored numerous, books, chapters, and journal articles. Her work focuses on appreciative dialogic transformation within a variety of social and institutional contexts including psychotherapy, organizations, education, healthcare, and local communities. She engages constructionist practices in a variety of contexts to bring communities of participants with diametrically opposing viewpoints together to create livable futures.

McNamee is married to a scholar of communication (Professor John Lannamann).  They reside in [[Durham, New Hampshire]].

== Work ==

=== Founding Member ===
McNamee is a founder, board member and vice president of the Taos Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taos Institute|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taos Institute is a nonprofit educational organization dedicated to the development of social constructionist theory and practices for purposes of world benefit. With over two hundred Associates around the world, the Taos Institute achieves their educational ends through conferences, workshops, publications, a Ph.D. program, distance learning programs, newsletters, learning networks, and web-based offerings. The Taos Institute also engages in [[collaborative partnership]]s with other national and international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taos Mission Statement|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/Websites/taos/images/AboutAbout/taos_mission_statement.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Constructionist theory and practice locates the source of meaning, value, and action in relational process.  Through our shared constructions of the real, the rational and the good, communities are formed and ways of life secured.  New ways of life can also be envisioned and created through relational processes. And when communities conflict, it is also through such process that peace may best be restored.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taos Mission Statement|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/Websites/taos/images/AboutAbout/taos_mission_statement.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awards ===
Awards received by McNamee include Class of 1944 Professorship at the University of New Hampshire (2001-2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unh.edu/news/news_releases/2001/september/em_20010907mcnamee.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Lindberg Award for Outstanding Scholar/Teacher in the College of Liberal Arts at the University of New Hampshire (2007–2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lindberg Award|url=http://www.unh.edu/liberal-arts/faculty/lindberg_2007.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, Sheila was added to the Fulbright Specialists Roster (2012-2017) and received a Fulbright Specialist Grant to work with faculty and students at the University of Caldas in Manizales, Colombia (May–June, 2012), exploring social constructionist theory and practice in social work, family development, social sciences, social research, conflict resolution, and mediation.
&lt;br /&gt;
:''"Rather than approach conflict and problem solving with the goal of minimizing differences among perspectives and working toward consensus, we must develop processes for creating a system of co-existence and collaboration that entails incommensurate but respected positions of difference. If you understand how communication creates a way of seeing the world, you can understand how those different views are internally coherent; starting from this position, we invite ourselves and others to become curious about our differences (first) rather than judgmental."'' said McNamee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universidad de Caldas Press Release|url=http://www.ucaldas.edu.co/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7270:-sheila-mcnamee-comparte-su-experiencia-en-comunicacion-en-u-de-caldas&amp;catid=419:universidad-al-dia&amp;Itemid=1039|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Author ===

Sheila McNamee is the author of several books on social construction.

Sheila co-authored ''Relational Responsibility: Resources for Sustainable Dialogue'' (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Relational Responsibility: Resources for Sustainable Dialogue|year=1999|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=0-7619-1094-8|author=Sheila McNamee|author2=Kenneth J. Gergen }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Kenneth Gergen. In ''Relational Responsibility'', Sheila and Ken question the tradition of individual responsibility and transform the concept of responsibility by giving centre stage to the relational process rather than to the individual - replacing alienation and isolation with meaningful dialogue.

McNamee co-authored ''Research and Social Change: A Relational Constructionist Approach''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Research and Social Change: A Relational Constructionist Approach|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-80671-8|author=McNamee, S.|author2=Hosking, D.M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2012) with Dian Marie Hosking. In this book, Sheila and Dian Marie bridge scholarly forms of inquiry and practitioners’ daily activities. They introduce inquiry as a process of relational construction, offering resources to practitioners who want to reflect on how their work generates practical effects. Sheila and Diane Marie lay out relational constructionist premises and explore these in terms of their generative possibilities both for inquiry and social change work.

{{hatnote|Please check whether this article should be merged with the articles [[Mobile ad hoc network]], [[Wireless ad hoc network]] and [[Wireless mesh network]].}}

'''Smart phone ad hoc''' or '''smart phone ad hoc networks''' ('''SPANs''') evolve from the underlying concept, architecture and technology behind a [[wireless ad hoc network]]. A smart phone is a device. Once embedded with ad hoc networking technology, a smart phone can create ad hoc networks among other devices. Smart phone ad hoc networks leverage the existing hardware (primarily Bluetooth and [[Wi-Fi]]) in commercially available smartphones to create peer-to-peer networks without relying on cellular carrier networks, wireless access points, or traditional network infrastructure. SPANs use the mechanism behind [[Wi-Fi]] ad-hoc mode, which allows phones to talk directly among each other, through a transparent neighbor and route discovery mechanism.

SPANs differ from traditional [[spoke–hub distribution paradigm|hub and spoke]] networks, such as [[Wi-Fi Direct]], in that they support [[multi-hop routing]] (ad hoc routing) and relays and there is no notion of a group leader, so peers can join and leave at will without destroying the network.

== Features ==
* Capable of going off-grid and enabling peer-to-peer communications without relying on cellular carrier networks, wireless access points, or traditional network infrastructure.
* Optional Internet access through gateway devices, such as mobile hotspots in the mesh.
* Optional stationary or portable infrastructures such as routers, mesh extenders, or other non-phone hardware.
* Leverage the devices that people carry on their person and use every day.
* Primarily use Bluetooth and Wi-Fi since the cellular spectrum is licensed and controlled by cellular providers and FCC regulations.
* Set up and tear down are on-demand. Join and leave at will.
* Routing protocol may be implemented at the Network Layer or Link Layer.
* Often requires rooting a device and making modifications to the operating system, kernel, or drivers.

== Threats to telcos ==
The ad hoc networking technology operating on [[Wi-Fi]] ad hoc mode, at the unlicensed [[ISM band]] of 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz may result in profit loss by cellular carriers since ISM band is free and unlicensed while cellular carriers operate on licensed band at 900&amp;nbsp;MHz, 1200&amp;nbsp;MHz, 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz, etc. This has the potential to threaten telecommunication operators (telcos). Smart phone [[mobile ad hoc network]]s can operate independently and allow communications among smart phones users without the need for any [[3G]] or [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] signals to be present. Wi-Fi ad hoc mode was first implemented on Lucent [[WaveLan]] 802.11a/b on laptop computers. The technology success is now carried forward and used in smart phones, since Wi-Fi is present and embedded in all smart phones today.

== Important applications ==
* Developing nations where network infrastructure doesn't exist.
* Protests where government entities monitor or disable network infrastructure.
* Natural disasters or terrorist incidents where existing network infrastructure is overloaded, destroyed, or compromised.
* Temporary Large-scale events such as festivals where huge scale is needed for short period of time

Below are some of the '''recent applications of smart phone ad hoc networks''' in real life:

== Apple Multipeer Connectivity ==
In [[Apple Inc.]] [[iPhone]]s released with iOS version 7.0 and higher, multipeer connectivity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity |title=MultipeerConnectivity Apple Developer Documentation}}&lt;/ref&gt; APIs (application programmable interfaces) are enabled and provided to allow Apple iPhones to operate in peer-to-peer ad hoc mesh networking mode.

In [[economics]], '''stagflation''', a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[Economic stagnation|stagnation]]'' and ''[[inflation]]'', is a situation in which the [[inflation rate]] is high, the [[economic growth]] rate slows, and [[unemployment]] remains steadily high. It raises a dilemma for [[economic policy]], since actions designed to lower inflation may exacerbate unemployment, and vice versa. The term is generally attributed to [[Iain Macleod]], a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician who became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1970; Macleod coined the phrase in a speech to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[Online Etymology Dictionary]].

[[John Maynard Keynes]] did not use the term, but some of his work refers to the conditions that most would recognise as stagflation. In the version of [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian macroeconomic theory]] that was dominant between the end of World War II and the late 1970s, inflation and recession were regarded as mutually exclusive, the relationship between the two being described by the [[Phillips curve]]. Stagflation is very costly and difficult to eradicate once it starts, both in social terms and in budget deficits.

==The Great Inflation==
The term "stagflation" was first coined during a period of inflation and unemployment in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom experienced an outbreak of inflation in the 1960s and 1970s. On 17 November 1965, [[Iain Macleod]], the spokesman on economic issues for the United Kingdom's Conservative Party, warned of the gravity of the UK economic situation in the House of Commons: {{quote|"We now have the worst of both worlds—not just inflation on the one side or stagnation on the other, but both of them together. We have a sort of "stagflation" situation. And history, in modern terms, is indeed being made."&lt;ref name=BankofEngland2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=stagflation&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}He used the term again on 7 July 1970, and the media began also to use it, for example in ''[[The Economist]]'' on 15 August 1970, and [[Newsweek]] on 19 March 1973.

In a Bank of England working papers series, article authors Edward Nelson and Kalin Nikolov (2002) examined causes and policy errors related to the Great Inflation in the United Kingdom in the 1970s, arguing that as inflation rose in the 1960s and 1970s, UK policy makers failed to recognize the primary role of monetary policy in controlling inflation. Instead, they attempted to use non-monetary policies and devices to respond to the economic crisis. Policy makers also made "inaccurate estimates of the degree of excess demand in the economy, [which] contributed significantly to the outbreak of inflation in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=BankofEngland2002 /&gt;

Stagflation was not limited to the United Kingdom, however. Economists have shown that stagflation was prevalent among seven major economies from 1973 to 1982.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Helliwell|first1=John|title=Comparative Macroeconomics of Stagflation|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=26|issue=1|pages=1–28|date=March 1988|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/scripts/search.pf?ft=Comparative+Macroeconomics+of+Stagflation|jstor=2726607}}&lt;/ref&gt; After inflation rates began to fall in 1982, economists' focus shifted from the causes of stagflation to the "determinants of productivity growth and the effects of real wages on the demand for labor".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Causes==
Economists offer two principal explanations for why stagflation occurs. First, stagflation can result when the economy faces a [[supply shock]], such as a rapid increase in the [[price of oil]]. An unfavorable situation like that tends to raise prices at the same time as it slows [[economic growth]] by making production more costly and less profitable.&lt;ref name="delong"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://econ161.berkeley.edu/multimedia/ASAD1.html |title=Supply Shocks: The Dilemma of Stagflation |accessdate=2008-01-24 |author=J.

Second, the government can cause stagflation if it creates policies that harm industry while growing the money supply too quickly. These two things would probably have to occur simultaneously because policies that slow economic growth don't usually cause inflation, and policies that cause inflation don't usually slow economic growth.

Both explanations are offered in analyses of the [[global stagflation of the 1970s]]. It began with a huge rise in oil prices, but then continued as central banks used excessively stimulative monetary policy to counteract the resulting recession, causing a [[price/wage spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Barsky|first1=Robert|last2=Kilian|first2=Lutz|year=2000|title=A Monetary Explanation of the Great Stagflation of the 1970s|publisher=University of Michigan|ref=harv|url=http://fordschool.umich.edu/rsie/workingpapers/Papers451-475/r452.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar Keynesian and monetarist views==

===Early Keynesianism and monetarism===
Up to the 1960s, many [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] economists ignored the possibility of stagflation, because historical experience suggested that high unemployment was typically associated with low inflation, and vice versa (this relationship is called the [[Phillips curve]]). The idea was that high demand for goods drives up prices, and also encourages firms to hire more; and likewise high employment raises demand. However, in the 1970s and 1980s, when stagflation occurred, it became obvious that the relationship between inflation and employment levels was not necessarily stable: that is, the Phillips relationship could shift. Macroeconomists became more skeptical of Keynesian theories, and  Keynesians themselves reconsidered their ideas in search of an explanation for stagflation.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard (2000), op. cit., Chap. 28, p. 541.&lt;/ref&gt;

The explanation for the shift of the Phillips curve was initially provided by the [[monetarist]] economist [[Milton Friedman]], and also by [[Edmund Phelps]]. Both argued that when workers and firms begin to expect more inflation, the Phillips curve shifts up (meaning that more inflation occurs at any given level of unemployment). In particular, they suggested that if inflation lasted for several years, workers and firms would start to take it into account during wage negotiations, causing workers' wages and firms' costs to rise more quickly, thus further increasing inflation. While this idea was a severe criticism of early Keynesian theories, it was gradually accepted by most Keynesians, and has been incorporated into [[New Keynesian]] economic models.

===Neo-Keynesianism===

Neo-Keynesian theory distinguished two distinct kinds of inflation: [[Demand-pull inflation|demand-pull]] (caused by shifts of the aggregate demand curve) and cost-push (caused by shifts of the aggregate supply curve). Stagflation, in this view, is caused by [[cost-push inflation]]. Cost-push inflation occurs when some force or condition increases the costs of production. This could be caused by government policies (such as taxes) or from purely external factors such as a shortage of natural resources or an act of war.

[[New Keynesian macroeconomics|Contemporary Keynesian]] analyses argue that stagflation can be understood by distinguishing factors that affect [[aggregate demand]] from those that affect [[aggregate supply]]. While monetary and fiscal policy can be used to stabilise the economy in the face of aggregate demand fluctuations, they are not very useful in confronting aggregate supply fluctuations. In particular, an adverse shock to aggregate supply, such as an increase in oil prices, can give rise to stagflation.&lt;ref name="abelbernanke"&gt;

=== Supply theory ===

==== Fundamentals ====
Supply theories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bronfenbrenner |first=Martin |year=1976 |title=Elements of Stagflation Theory |journal=Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie |volume=36 |pages=1–8 |id= |url= |quote= |doi=10.1007/BF01283912 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; are based on the neo-Keynesian cost-push model and attribute stagflation to significant disruptions to the supply side of the supply-demand market equation, for example, when there is a sudden real or relative scarcity of key commodities, natural resources, or [[natural capital]] needed to produce goods and services. Other factors may also cause supply problems, for example, social and political conditions such as policy changes, acts of war, extremely restrictive government control of production.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} In this view, stagflation is thought to occur when there is an adverse [[supply shock]] (for example, a sudden increase in the price of [[Petroleum|oil]] or a new tax) that causes a subsequent jump in the "cost" of goods and services (often at the wholesale level).  In technical terms, this results in contraction or negative shift in an economy's aggregate [[Supply and demand|supply curve]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In the resource scarcity scenario (Zinam 1982), stagflation results when economic growth is inhibited by a restricted supply of raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=V.Kerry |year=1979|title=Scarcity and Growth Reconsidered |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press for Resources for the Future|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Krautkraemer|first1=Jeffrey|date=March 2002 |title=ECONOMICS OF SCARCITY: STATE OF THE DEBATE|publisher=Washington State University|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, when the actual or relative supply of basic materials (fossil fuels (energy), minerals, agricultural land in production, timber, etc.) decreases and/or cannot be increased fast enough in response to rising or continuing demand.  The resource shortage may be a real physical shortage or a relative scarcity due to factors such as taxes or bad monetary policy which have affected the "cost" or availability of raw materials.  This is consistent with the cost-push inflation factors in neo-Keynesian theory (above). The way this plays out is that after supply shock occurs, the economy will first try to maintain momentum – that is, consumers and businesses will begin paying higher prices in order to maintain their level of demand. The central bank may exacerbate this by increasing the money supply, by lowering interest rates for example, in an effort to combat a recession. The increased money supply props up the demand for goods and services, though demand would normally drop during a recession.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In the Keynesian model, higher prices will prompt increases in the supply of goods and services. However, during a supply shock (i.e. scarcity, "bottleneck" in resources, etc.), supplies don't respond as they normally would to these price pressures.  So, inflation jumps and output drops, producing stagflation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==== Explaining the 1970s stagflation ====
{{Further|Nixon Shock}}
Following [[Richard Nixon]]'s imposition of [[wage and price controls]] on 15 August 1971, an initial wave of cost-push shocks in commodities were blamed for causing spiraling prices. The second major shock was the [[1973 oil crisis]], when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ([[OPEC]]) constrained the worldwide supply of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926216,00.html |title=Over a Barrel |work=Time Magazine | date=3 October 1983 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both events, combined with the overall [[1970s Energy Crisis|energy shortage]] that characterized the 1970s, resulted in actual or relative scarcity of raw materials. The price controls resulted in shortages at the point of purchase, causing, for example, queues of consumers at fuelling stations and increased production costs for industry.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908367-1,00.html |title=Panic at the Pump|work=Time Magazine | date=14 January 1974 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent views==

Through the mid-1970s, it was alleged that none of the major macroeconomic models ([[Keynesian]], [[New Classical]], and [[monetarist]]) were able to explain stagflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Helliwell|first1=John|title=Comparative Macroeconomics of Stagflation|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=26|issue=1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, an explanation was provided based on the effects of adverse supply shocks on both inflation and output.&lt;ref name="blanchard"&gt;
{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-13-013306-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this discussion, Blanchard hypothesizes that the recent [[oil price]] increases could trigger another period of stagflation, although this has not yet happened (pg. 152).

==Neoclassical views==

A purely [[New classical macroeconomics|neoclassical]] view of the macroeconomy rejects the idea that monetary policy can have real effects.&lt;ref&gt;Abel &amp; Bernanke (1995), op. cit., Ch. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Neoclassical macroeconomists argue that [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real]] economic quantities, like real [[GDP|output]], [[employment]], and [[unemployment]], are determined by real factors only. [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|Nominal]] factors like changes in the money supply only affect nominal variables like inflation. The neoclassical idea that nominal factors cannot have real effects is often called "[[monetary neutrality]]"&lt;ref&gt;Abel &amp; Bernanke (1995), op. cit., Ch. 11, pp. 378–9.&lt;/ref&gt; or also the "[[classical dichotomy]]".

Since the neoclassical viewpoint says that real phenomena like unemployment are essentially unrelated to nominal phenomena like inflation, a neoclassical economist would offer two separate explanations for 'stagnation' and 'inflation'. Neoclassical explanations of stagnation (low growth and high unemployment) include inefficient government regulations or high benefits for the unemployed that give people less incentive to look for jobs.  Another neoclassical explanation of stagnation is given by [[real business cycle theory]], in which any decrease in [[labour productivity]] makes it efficient to work less.  The main neoclassical explanation of inflation is very simple: it happens when the [[central bank|monetary authorities]] increase the money supply too much.&lt;ref name="barrogrilli"&gt;
{{cite book

  | first = Robert

  | year = 1994
  | isbn = 0-333-57764-7
  | page = 139
 }}Ch. 8,  Fig. 8.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the neoclassical viewpoint, the real factors that determine output and unemployment affect the [[aggregate supply]] curve only. The nominal factors that determine inflation affect the [[aggregate demand]] curve only.&lt;ref&gt;Abel &amp; Bernanke (1995), Ch. 11, pp. 376–7.&lt;/ref&gt; When some adverse changes in real factors are shifting the aggregate supply curve left at the same time that unwise monetary policies are shifting the aggregate demand curve right, the result is stagflation.

Thus the main explanation for stagflation under a classical view of the economy is simply policy errors that affect both inflation and the labour market. Ironically, a very clear argument in favour of the classical explanation of stagflation was provided by Keynes himself. In 1919, [[John Maynard Keynes]] described the inflation and economic stagnation gripping Europe in his book [[The Economic Consequences of the Peace]].  Keynes wrote:

:"Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some." [...]

:"Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose."

Keynes explicitly pointed out the relationship between governments printing money and inflation.

:"The inflationism of the currency systems of Europe has proceeded to extraordinary lengths. The various belligerent Governments, unable, or too timid or too short-sighted to secure from loans or taxes the resources they required, have printed notes for the balance."

Keynes also pointed out how government price controls discourage production.

:"The presumption of a spurious value for the currency, by the force of law expressed in the regulation of prices, contains in itself, however, the seeds of final economic decay, and soon dries up the sources of ultimate supply. If a man is compelled to exchange the fruits of his labours for paper which, as experience soon teaches him, he cannot use to purchase what he requires at a price comparable to that which he has received for his own products, he will keep his produce for himself, dispose of it to his friends and neighbours as a favour, or relax his efforts in producing it. A system of compelling the exchange of commodities at what is not their real relative value not only relaxes production, but leads finally to the waste and inefficiency of barter."

Keynes detailed the relationship between German government deficits and inflation.

:"In Germany the total expenditure of the Empire, the Federal States, and the Communes in 1919–20 is estimated at 25 milliards of marks, of which not above 10 milliards are covered by previously existing taxation. This is without allowing anything for the payment of the indemnity. In Russia, Poland, Hungary, or Austria such a thing as a budget cannot be seriously considered to exist at all."

:"Thus the menace of inflationism described above is not merely a product of the war, of which peace begins the cure. It is a continuing phenomenon of which the end is not yet in sight."

===Keynesian in the short run, classical in the long run===
While most economists believe that changes in money supply can have some real effects in the short run, neoclassical and neo-Keynesian economists tend to agree that there are no long-run effects from changing the money supply. Therefore, even economists who consider themselves neo-Keynesians usually believe that in the long run, money is [[monetary neutrality|neutral]]. In other words, while neoclassical and neo-Keynesian models are often seen as competing points of view, they can also be seen as two descriptions appropriate for different time horizons. Many mainstream textbooks today treat the neo-Keynesian model as a more appropriate description of the economy in the short run, when prices are '[[Sticky (economics)|sticky]]', and treat the neoclassical model as a more appropriate description of the economy in the long run, when prices have sufficient time to adjust fully.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Therefore, while mainstream economists today might often attribute short periods of stagflation (not more than a few years) to adverse changes in supply, they would not accept this as an explanation of very prolonged stagflation. More prolonged stagflation would be explained as the effect of inappropriate government policies: excessive regulation of product markets and labor markets leading to long-run stagnation, and excessive growth of the money supply leading to long-run inflation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Alternative views==

=== As differential accumulation ===
{{Main|Differential accumulation}}
[[Political economy#Current approaches|Political economists]] [[Jonathan Nitzan]] and [[Shimshon Bichler]] have proposed an explanation of stagflation as part of a theory they call [[differential accumulation]], which says firms seek to beat the average profit and capitalisation rather than maximise. According to this theory, periods of mergers and acquisitions oscillate with periods of stagflation. When mergers and acquisitions are no longer politically feasible (governments clamp down with anti-monopoly rules), stagflation is used as an alternative to have higher relative profit than the competition. With increasing mergers and acquisitions, the power to implement stagflation increases.

Stagflation appears as a societal crisis, such as during the period of the oil crisis in the 70s and in 2007 to 2010. Inflation in stagflation, however, doesn't affect all firms equally. Dominant firms are able to increase their own prices at a faster rate than competitors. While in the aggregate no one appears to be profiting, differentially dominant firms improve their positions with higher relative profits and higher relative capitalisation. Stagflation is not due to any actual supply shock, but because of the societal crisis that hints at a supply crisis. It is mostly a 20th and 21st century phenomenon that has been mainly used by the "weapondollar-petrodollar coalition" creating or using Middle East crises for the benefit of pecuniary interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nitzan |first=Jonathan |date=June 2001 |title= Regimes of differential accumulation: mergers, stagflation and the logic of globalization |journal=Review of International Political Economy |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=226–274 |url=http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/3/ |doi=10.1080/09692290010033385 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demand-pull stagflation theory===
Demand-pull stagflation theory explores the idea that stagflation can result exclusively from monetary shocks without any concurrent supply shocks or negative shifts in economic output potential.  Demand-pull theory describes a scenario where stagflation can occur following a period of monetary policy implementations that cause inflation.  This theory was first proposed in 1999 by Eduardo Loyo of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Loyo|first1=Eduardo|date=June 1999|title=Demand-Pull Stagflation (Draft Working Paper)|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research New Working Papers|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080216020755/http://www.nber.org/~confer/99/efcesi99/loyo.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supply-side theory===
[[Supply-side economics]] emerged as a response to US stagflation in the 1970s. It largely attributed inflation to the ending of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1971 and the lack of a specific price reference in the subsequent monetary policies (Keynesian and Monetarism).  Supply-side economists asserted that the contraction component of stagflation resulted from an inflation-induced rise in real tax rates (see [[bracket creep]]){{citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Austrian School of economics===
Adherents to the [[Austrian School]] maintain that creation of new money [[ex nihilo]] benefits the creators and early recipients of the new money relative to late recipients.  [[Money creation]] is not wealth creation; it merely allows early money recipients to outbid late recipients for resources, goods, and services.
Since the actual producers of wealth are typically late recipients, increases in the money supply weakens wealth formation and undermines the rate of economic growth. Says Austrian economist Frank Shostak:

"The increase in the money supply rate of growth coupled with the slowdown in the rate of growth of goods produced is what the increase in the rate of price inflation is all about. (Note that a price is the amount of money paid for a unit of a good.) What we have here is a faster increase in price inflation and a decline in the rate of growth in the production of goods. But this is exactly what stagflation is all about, i.e., an increase in price inflation and a fall in real economic growth.  Popular opinion is that stagflation is totally made up. It seems therefore that the phenomenon of stagflation is the normal outcome of loose monetary policy. This is in agreement with [Phelps and Friedman (PF)]. Contrary to PF, however, we maintain that stagflation is not caused by the fact that in the short run people are fooled by the central bank. Stagflation is the natural result of monetary pumping which weakens the pace of economic growth and at the same time raises the rate of increase of the prices of goods and services."&lt;ref name="shostak"&gt;

===Jane Jacobs and the influence of cities on stagflation===

In 1984, journalist and activist [[Jane Jacobs]] proposed the failure of major macroeconomic theories&lt;ref group=notes&gt;including those of [[Adam Smith]], [[Karl Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Irving Fisher]], and [[Milton Friedman]]&lt;/ref&gt; to explain stagflation was due to their focus on the nation as the salient unit of economic analysis, rather than the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacobs|first1=Jane|title=Cities and the Wealth of Nations|date=1984|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0394480473}}&lt;/ref&gt; She proposed the key to avoiding stagflation was for a nation to focus on the development of "import-replacing cities", which would experience economic ups and downs at different times, providing overall national stability and avoiding widespread stagflation. According to Jacobs, import-replacing cities are those which have developed economies balancing their own production with domestic imports, meaning they can respond with flexibility as economic supply and demand cycles change over time. While lauding her originality, clarity, and consistency, urban planning scholars have criticized Jacobs for not comparing her own ideas to those of major theorists (e.g., [[Adam Smith]], [[Karl Marx]]) with the same depth and breadth they developed, as well as a lack of scholarly documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=David|title=Jane Jacobs' Ideas on Big, Diverse Cities: A Review and Commentary|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|date=1988|volume=54|issue=3|pages=302–314|doi=10.1080/01944368808976491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these issues, Jacobs' work is notable for having widespread public readership and influence on decision-makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=David|title=Jane Jacobs' Ideas on Big, Diverse Cities: A Review and Commentary|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|date=1988|volume=54|issue=3|page=312|doi=10.1080/01944368808976491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==
Stagflation undermined support for the Keynesian consensus.

Federal Reserve chairman [[Paul Volcker]] very sharply increased interest rates from 1979–1983 in what was called a "[[disinflation|disinflationary scenario]]." After U.S. prime interest rates had soared into the double-digits, inflation did come down; these interest rates were the highest long-term prime interest rates that had ever existed in modern capital markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Homer|Sylla|Sylla|1996|loc=p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volcker is often credited with having stopped at least the inflationary side of stagflation, although the American economy also dipped into recession. Starting in approximately 1983, growth began a recovery. Both fiscal stimulus and money supply growth were policy at this time. A five- to six-year jump in unemployment during the Volcker disinflation suggests Volcker may have trusted unemployment to self-correct and return to its [[natural rate of unemployment|natural rate]] within a reasonable period.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

{{other uses2|Steady state}}

A '''steady-state economy''' is an economy made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant population size. In effect, such an economy does not grow in the course of time. The term usually refers to the [[economy|national economy]] of a particular country, but it is also applicable to the economic system of a city, a region, or the [[world economy|entire world]]. Early in the [[history of economic thought]], [[classical economics|classical economist]] [[Adam Smith]] of the 18th century developed the concept of a ''stationary state'' of an economy: Smith believed that any national economy in the world would sooner or later settle in a final state of [[wikt:stationarity|stationarity]].

Since the 1970s, the concept of a steady-state economy has been associated mainly with the work of leading [[ecological economics|ecological economist]] [[Herman Daly]].&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xi-xvi}} As Daly's concept of a ''steady-state'' includes the ecological analysis of natural resource flows through the economy, his concept differs from the original classical concept of a ''stationary state''. One other difference is that Daly recommends immediate political action to establish the steady-state economy by imposing permanent government restrictions on all resource use, whereas economists of the classical period believed that the final stationary state of any economy would evolve by itself without any government intervention.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|135f}}&lt;ref name=hd04/&gt;{{rp|55f}}

The world's [[Ecological footprint|mounting ecological problems]] have brought about a widening interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Critics of the steady-state economy usually object to it by arguing that [[Sustainability#Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth|resource decoupling]], [[Productivity improving technologies|technological development]], and the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|unrestrained operation of market mechanisms]] are capable of overcoming any resource scarcity, any rampant pollution, or population overshoot. Proponents of the steady-state economy, on the other hand, maintain that these objections remain insubstantial and mistaken — and that the need for a steady-state economy is becoming more compelling every day.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;&lt;ref name=bc01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|148–155}}

A steady-state economy is not to be confused with [[economic stagnation]]: Whereas a steady-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, economic stagnation is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a [[Economic growth|growth economy]].

An ideological contrast to the steady-state economy is formed by the concept of a [[post-scarcity economy]].

== Definition and vision ==
Herman Daly defines his concept of a steady-state economy as an economic system made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant stock of people (population), both stocks to be maintained by a flow of [[natural resource]]s through the system. The first component, the constant stocks, is similar to the concept of the ''stationary state'', originally used in [[classical economics]]; the second component, the flow of natural resources, is a new [[Ecology|ecological feature]], presently also used in the academic discipline of [[ecological economics]]. The ''durability'' of both of the constant stocks is to be maximized: The more durable the stock of capital is, the smaller the flow of natural resources is needed to maintain the stock; likewise, a 'durable' population means a population enjoying a high life expectancy — something desirable by itself — maintained by a low birth rate and an equally low death rate. Taken together, higher durability translates into better ecology in the system as a whole.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|14–19}}

Daly's concept of a steady-state economy is based on the vision that man's economy is an open subsystem embedded in a finite natural environment of scarce resources and fragile ecosystems. The economy is maintained by importing valuable natural resources from the input end and exporting valueless waste and pollution at the output end in a constant and irreversible flow. Any subsystem of a finite nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing and start maintaining itself in a steady-state as far as possible. This vision is opposed to [[Neoclassical economics|mainstream neoclassical economics]], where the economy is represented by an isolated and circular model with goods and services exchanging endlessly between companies and households, without exhibiting any physical contact to the natural environment.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}

In the early 2010s, reviewers sympathetic towards Daly's concept of a steady-state economy have passed the concurrent judgement that although his concept remains beyond what is politically feasible at present, there is room for mainstream thinking and collective action to approach the concept in the future.&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|549}} &lt;ref name=ma01/&gt;{{rp|84}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|83}}

== Present situation: Exceeding global limits to growth ==
{{See also |Planetary boundaries |Anthropocene |List of environmental issues |Societal collapse }}
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|upright| Like any other planet, earth is finite]]

The world's mounting ecological problems have stimulated interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Since the 1990s, most metrics have provided evidence that the volume of the [[world economy]] far exceeds critical global limits to [[economic growth]] already.&lt;ref name=dm01/&gt; According to the [[Ecological footprint#Footprint measurements|ecological footprint measure]], earth's [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] — that is, earth's long-term capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — was exceeded by some 30 percent in 1995. By 2018, this figure had increased to some 70 percent.&lt;ref name=gfn01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jw01/&gt; In effect, mankind is confronted with planetary [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse]] in our time. The significant impact of human activities on earth's ecosystems has motivated some geologists to propose the present [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] be named the ''[[anthropocene]]''.&lt;ref name=welanth/&gt; The following issues have raised much concern worldwide:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Overpopulation
World population is [[Human overpopulation #Overview|expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050]], and continue growing thereafter. This unprecedented number of people is already stressing [[World population #Environmental impacts|natural environments]] and [[Habitat destruction|wildlife habitats]] everywhere, increasing pollution levels, and worsening human living conditions. Uncontrolled urbanisation forces millions to live in congested [[shanty town]]s, and large cities swell to become [[Megacity|megacities]] with [[Megacity#Crime|high crime]] [[Megacity#Slums|slum areas]]. Overpopulation may even lead to [[War#Youth bulge|social conflict and violence]], when too many people, especially young males, compete for too few employment opportunities in [[Economic stagnation|stagnating economies]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Pollution and global warming
Air pollution emanating from motor vehicles and industrial plants is [[Pollution#Human health|damaging public health]] and increasing mortality rates. The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere is the apparent source of [[global warming]] and climate changes. [[Regional effects of global warming|Extreme regional weather patterns]] and [[Sea level rise#Effects|rising sea levels]] caused by warming degrade living conditions in many — if not all — parts of the world. The warming already poses a [[Climate security#General|security threat]] to many nations and works as a so-called [[Effects of global warming on humans#Security|'threat multiplier']] to geo-political stability. Even worse, the [[Arctic methane emissions#Loss of permafrost|loss of Arctic permafrost]] may be triggering a [[Permafrost #Predicted rate of change in the Arctic|massive release of methane and other greenhouse gases from thawing soils]] in the region, thereby overwhelming political action to counter climate change. If critical temperature thresholds are crossed, a so-called [[Climate state #Hothouse|'Hothouse climate state']] may be the end result in the future.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Depletion of non-renewable minerals
Non-renewable [[Mineral resource classification|mineral reserves]] are currently extracted at high and [[Sustainable development#Insubstantial stretching of the term|unsustainable rates]] from [[Structure of the Earth#Crust|earth's crust]]. Remaining reserves are likely to [[Peak minerals#Future production|become ever more costly to extract in the near future]], and will reach depletion at some point. The era of relatively peaceful economic expansion that has prevailed globally since World War II may be interrupted by unexpected [[supply shock]]s or simply be succeeded by the [[Hubbert peak theory#Hubbert peaks|peaking depletion paths]] of [[Peak oil|oil]] and [[Critical mineral raw materials|other valuable minerals]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Net depletion of renewable resources
Use of [[Natural resource#Classification|renewable]] resources in excess of their replenishment rates is undermining [[ecological stability]] worldwide. Between 2000 and 2012, [[deforestation]] resulted in some 14 percent of the equivalent of earth's original forest cover to be cut down. Tropical rainforests have been subject to [[Rainforest#Deforestation|deforestation]] at a rapid pace for decades — especially in [[Deforestation by region#Africa|west and central Africa]] and in [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|Brazil]] — mostly due to [[Deforestation#Causes|subsistence farming, population pressure, and urbanization]]. Population pressures also strain the [[Soil retrogression and degradation#Consequences of soil regression and degradation|world's soil systems]], leading to land degradation, mostly in developing countries. Global erosion rates on conventional cropland are estimated to [[Human impact on the environment#Agricultural land loss and soil erosion|exceed soil creation rates]] by more than ten times. Widespread overuse of [[groundwater]] results in [[Water scarcity#Overview of regions suffering crisis impacts|water deficits]] in many countries. By 2025, [[Water security#Fresh water|water scarcity]] could impact the living conditions of two-thirds of the world's population.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Loss of biodiversity
The destructive impact of human activity on [[Habitat destruction|wildlife habitats]] worldwide is accelerating the [[Anthropocene#Biodiversity|extinction of rare species]], thereby substantially reducing [[Biodiversity#Species loss rates|earth's biodiversity]]. The [[Nitrogen cycle|natural nitrogen cycle]] is heavily overloaded by [[Nitrogen fixation#Industrial nitrogen fixation|industrial nitrogen fixation and use]], thereby [[Human impact on the nitrogen cycle#Impacts of anthropogenic inputs on the nitrogen cycle|disrupting most known types of ecosystems]]. The [[Marine pollution#Plastic debris|accumulating plastic debris]] in the oceans decimates aquatic life. [[Ocean acidification]] due to the excess concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere is resulting in [[coral bleaching]] and [[Ocean acidification#Impacts on oceanic calcifying organisms|impedes shell-bearing organisms]]. [[Arctic sea ice decline]] caused by global warming is [[Polar bear#Climate change|endangering the polar bear]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These mounting concerns have prompted an increasing number of academics and other writers to point to limits to [[economic growth]], and to question — and even oppose — the prevailing ideology of infinite economic growth.&lt;ref name=dm01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jd02/&gt;&lt;ref name=rh01/&gt;&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jg03/&gt;&lt;ref name=pe01/&gt;&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;&lt;ref name=bm01/&gt;&lt;ref name=pg01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rf01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;&lt;ref name=bc01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=ub02/&gt;&lt;ref name=nk01/&gt;&lt;ref name=ek01/&gt;&lt;ref name=hs01/&gt;&lt;ref name=av01/&gt;&lt;ref name=gd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=pr01/&gt;&lt;ref name=wr01/&gt;&lt;ref name=do03/&gt;

== Historical background ==
For centuries, economists and other scholars have considered matters of natural resource scarcity and limits to growth, from the early [[Classical economics|classical economists]] in the 18th and 19th centuries down to the ecological concerns that emerged in the second half of the 20th century and developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an independent academic subdiscipline in [[economics]].

=== Concept of the stationary state in classical economics ===
{{Main|Classical economics}}
{{See also|Tendency of the rate of profit to fall}}
From [[Adam Smith]] and onwards, economists in the [[classical economics|classical period of economic theorising]] described the general development of society in terms of a contrast between the scarcity of arable agricultural land on the one hand, and the growth of population and capital on the other hand. The incomes from gross production were distributed as rents, profits and wages among landowners, capitalists and labourers respectively, and these three classes were incessantly engaged in the struggle for increasing their own share. The accumulation of capital (net investments) would sooner or later come to an end as the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|rate of profit fell to a minimum or to nil]]. At that point, the economy would settle in a final stationary state with a constant population size and a constant stock of capital.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|3}} &lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|295}}

==== Adam Smith's concept ====
{{Main|Adam Smith}}
{{See also|Invisible hand}}
{{Further|The Wealth of Nations}}
[[File:Adam Smith The Muir portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Smith examined the economic states of various nations in the world]]
[[Adam Smith]]'s [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, laid the foundation of [[classical economics]] in Britain. Smith thereby disseminated and established a concept that has since been a cornerstone in [[economics]] throughout most of the world: In a [[capitalism|liberal capitalist society]], provided with a stable institutional and legal framework, an '[[invisible hand]]' will ensure that the enlightened self-interest of all members of society will contribute to the growth and prosperity of society as a whole, thereby leading to an 'obvious and simple system of natural liberty'.&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|349f, 533f}}

Smith was convinced of the beneficial effect of the enlightened self-interest on the wealth of nations; but he was less certain this wealth would grow forever. Smith observed that any country in the world found itself in either a 'progressive', a 'stationary', or a 'declining' state: Although England was wealthier than its North American colonies, wages were higher in the latter place as wealth in North America was growing faster than in England; hence, North America was in the 'cheerful and hearty' progressive state. In China, on the other hand, wages were low, the condition of poor people was scantier than in any nation in Europe, and more marriages were contracted here because the 'horrid' killing of newborn babies was permitted and even widely practised; hence, China was in the 'dull' stationary state, although it did not yet seem to be declining. In nations situated in the 'melancholic' declining state, the higher ranks of society would fall down and settle for occupation amid the lower ranks, while the lowest ranks would either subsist on a miserable and insufficient wage, resort to begging or crime, or slide into starvation and early death. Bengal and some other English settlements in the East Indies possibly found themselves in this state, Smith reckoned.&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|59–68}}

Smith pointed out that as wealth was growing in any nation, the rate of profit would tend to fall and investment opportunities would diminish. In a nation that had thereby reached this 'full complement of riches', society would finally settle in a stationary state with a constant stock of people and capital. In an 18th-century anticipation of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' ([[#LtG|see below]]), Smith described the state as follows:

{{cquote|In a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the nature of its soil and climate, and its situation with respect to other countries, allowed it to acquire; which could, therefore, advance no further, and which was not going backwards, both the wages of labour and the profits of stock would probably be very low. In a country fully peopled in proportion to what either its territory could maintain or its stock employ, the competition for employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up the number of labourers, and, the country being already fully peopled, that number could never be augmented. In a country fully stocked in proportion to all the business it had to transact, as great a quantity of stock would be employed in every particular branch as the nature and extent of the trade would admit. The competition, therefore, would everywhere be as great, and consequently the ordinary profit as low as possible."&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|78}}}}

According to Smith, Holland seemed to be approaching this stationary state, although at a much higher level than in China. Smith believed the laws and institutions of China prevented this country from achieving the potential wealth its soil, climate and situation might have admitted of.&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|78f}} Smith was unable to provide any contemporary examples of a nation in the world that had in fact reached the full complement of riches and thus had settled in stationarity, because, as he conjectured, "... perhaps no country has ever yet arrived at this degree of opulence."&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|78}}

==== David Ricardo's concept ====
{{Main|David Ricardo}}
{{See also|Ricardian economics|Corn Laws}}
{{Further||On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation}}
[[File:David ricardo.jpg|thumb|upright|Ricardo was opposed to the interests of the landowning class]]
In the early 19th century, [[David Ricardo]] was the leading economist of the day and the champion of British [[Classical liberalism|''laissez-faire'' liberalism]]. He is known today for his [[Free trade #Economic models|free trade principle]] of [[comparative advantage]], and for his formulation of the controversial [[labor theory of value]]. Ricardo replaced Adam Smith's [[Empirical research|empirical reasoning]] with [[Deductive reasoning|abstract principles and deductive argument]]. This new methodology would later become the norm in economics as a science.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|135f}}

In Ricardo's times, Britain's trade with the European continent was somewhat disrupted during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] that had raged since 1803. The [[Continental System]] brought into effect a large-scale [[embargo]] against British trade, whereby the nation's food supply came to rely heavily on domestic agriculture to the benefit of the landowning classes. When the wars ended with [[Battle of Waterloo#French disintegration|Napoleon's final defeat]] in 1815, the landowning classes dominating the British parliament had managed to tighten the existing [[Corn Laws]] in order to retain their [[Monopoly|monopoly status]] on the home market during peacetime. The controversial Corn Laws were a [[protectionist]] two-sided measure of [[subsidies]] on corn exports and [[tariff]]s on corn imports. The tightening was opposed by both the capitalist and the labouring classes, as the high price of bread effectively reduced real profits and real wages in the economy. So was the political setting when Ricardo published his treatise ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' in 1817.&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|6–10}}

According to Ricardo, the limits to growth were ever present due to scarcity of arable agricultural land in the country. In the wake of the wartime period, the British economy seemed to be approaching the stationary state as population was growing, plots of land with lower fertility were put into agricultural use, and the rising rents of the rural landowning class were crowding out the profits of the urban capitalists. This was the broad outline of Ricardo's controversial [[Economic rent#Land rent|land rent theory]]. Ricardo believed that the only way for Britain to avoid the stationary state was to increase her volume of [[international trade]]: The country should export more industrial products and start importing cheap agricultural products from abroad in turn. However, this course of development was impeded by the Corn Laws that seemed to be hampering both the [[industrialisation]] and the [[internationalization]] of the British economy. In the 1820s, Ricardo and his followers – Ricardo himself died in 1823 – directed much of their fire at the Corn Laws in order to have them repealed, and various other free trade campaigners borrowed indiscriminately from Ricardo's doctrines to suit their agenda.&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|202f}}

The Corn Laws were not repealed before 1846. In the meantime, the British economy kept growing, a fact that effectively undermined the credibility and thrust of Ricardian economics in Britain;&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|223}} but Ricardo had by now established himself as the first stationary state theorist in the [[history of economic thought]].&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|88f}}

Ricardo's preoccupation with [[class conflict]] anticipated the work of [[Karl Marx]] ([[#Karl Marx|see below]]).

==== John Stuart Mill's concept ====
{{Main|John Stuart Mill}}
{{See also|Liberalism #Classical and modern|Utilitarianism #Classical utilitarianism}}
{{Further|Principles of Political Economy|On Liberty|Utilitarianism}}
[[File:JohnStuartMill.JPG|thumb|upright|Mill believed the future stationary state was both inevitable, necessary and desirable]]
John Stuart Mill was the leading economist, philosopher and social reformer in mid-19th century Britain. His economics treatise on the ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'', published in 1848, attained status as the standard textbook in economics throughout the English-speaking world until the turn of the century.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|179}}

A champion of [[Liberalism#Classical and modern|classical liberalism]], Mill believed that an ideal society should allow all individuals to pursue their own good without any interference from others or from government.&lt;ref name=jsm02/&gt; Also a [[Utilitarianism#Classical utilitarianism|utilitarian philosopher]], Mill regarded the 'Greatest Happiness Principle' as the ultimate ideal for a harmonious society:

{{cquote|As the means of making the nearest approach to this ideal, utility would enjoin, first, that laws and social arrangements should place the happiness ... of every individual, as nearly as possible in harmony with the interest of the whole; and secondly, that education and opinion, which have so vast a power over human character, should so use that power as to establish in the mind of every individual an indissoluble association between his own happiness and the good of the whole; ...&lt;ref name=jsm03/&gt;{{rp|19}}}}

Mill's concept of the stationary state was strongly coloured by these ideals.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|16}} &lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|213}} Mill conjectured that the stationary state of society was not too far away in the future:

{{cquote|It must always have been seen, more or less distinctly, by political economists, that the increase of wealth is not boundless; that at the end of what they term the progressive state lies the stationary state, that all progress in wealth is but a postponement of this, and that each step in advance is an approach to it. We have now been led to recognize that this ultimate goal is at all times near enough to be fully in view; that we are always on the verge of it, and that, if we have not reached it long ago, it is because the goal itself flies before us.&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|592}}}}

Contrary to both Smith and Ricardo before him, Mill took an optimistic view on the future stationary state. Mill could not "... regard the stationary state of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested toward it by political economists of the old school."&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|593}} Instead, Mill attributed many important qualities to this future state, he even believed the state would bring about "... a very considerable improvement on our present condition."&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|593}} According to Mill, the stationary state was at one and the same time inevitable, necessary and desirable: It was ''inevitable'', because the accumulation of capital would bring about a falling rate of profit that would diminish investment opportunities and hamper further accumulation; it was also ''necessary'', because mankind had to learn how to reduce its size and its level of consumption within the boundaries set by nature and by employment opportunities; finally, the stationary state was ''desirable'', as it would ease the introduction of public income redistibution schemes, create more equality and put an end to man's ruthless struggle to get by — instead, the human spirit would be liberated to the benefit of more elevated social and cultural activities, 'the graces of life'.&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|592–596}}

Hence, Mill was able to express all of his liberal ideals for mankind through his concept of the stationary state.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|14f}} &lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|213}} It has been argued that Mill essentially made a quality-of-life argument for the stationary state.&lt;ref name=ma01/&gt;{{rp|79}}

=== Main developments in economics since Mill ===
{{See also|Marxism|Neoclassical economics}}
When the influence of John Stuart Mill and his ''Principles'' declined, the classical-liberalist period of economic theorising came to an end. By the turn of the 19th century, [[Marxism]] and [[neoclassical economics]] had emerged to dominate economics. This development led to the exclusion of any concern with natural resource scarcity in economic modelling and analysis:

[[File:Marx6.jpg|thumb|upright|Marx replaced the concept of a stationary state with his vision of a communist society that would bring about abundance for everybody]]
{{anchor|Karl Marx}}
* Although a classical economist in his own right, [[Karl Marx]] abandoned the earlier concept of a stationary state and replaced it with his own unique vision of [[historical materialism]], according to which human societies pass through several [[Mode of production|'modes of production']], eventually leading to [[communism]]. In each mode of production, man's increasing mastery over nature and the '[[productive forces]]' of society develop to a point where the [[class conflict]] bursts into [[revolution]]s, followed by the establishment of a new mode of production. In opposition to his liberalist predecessors in the field, Marx did not regard natural resource scarcity as a factor constraining future economic growth; instead, the capitalist mode of production was to be overturned before the productive forces of society could fully develop, bringing about an abundance of goods in a new society based on the principle of "from each according to ability, to each according to need" — that is, communism. The assumption, based on [[Technology#Optimism|technological optimism]], was that communism would overcome any resource scarcity ever to be encountered.&lt;ref name=rg01/&gt;{{rp|292}} For ideological reasons, then, orthodox Marxism has mostly been opposed to any concern with natural resource scarcity ever since Marx's own day.&lt;ref name=rg01/&gt;{{rp|57–65}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|218–225}} &lt;ref name=pb01/&gt;{{rp|5f}} However, the march of history has been hard on this ideology: By 1991, German sociologist [[Reiner Grundmann]] was able to make the rather sweeping observation that "Orthodox Marxism has vanished from the scene, [[Left-wing politics|leftism]] has turned [[Green politics|green]], and Marxists have become [[Ecology|ecologists]]."&lt;ref name=rg01/&gt;{{rp|52}}
* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the other hand, the preoccupation with society's long term growth and development inherent in classical economics was abandoned altogether; instead, economic analysis came to focus on the study of the relationship between given ends and given scarce means, forming the concept of [[general equilibrium theory]] within an essentially static framework. Hence, neoclassical economics achieved greater generality, but only by asking easier questions; and any concern with natural resource scarcity was neglected.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|295–299}} &lt;ref name=rc01/&gt;{{rp|55–57}} For this reason, modern [[Ecological economics|ecological economists]] have deplored the simplified and ecologically harmful features of neoclassical economics: It has been argued that neoclassical economics has become a [[pseudoscience]] of choice between anything in general and nothing in particular, while neglecting the [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] of future generations;&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|156–160}} that the very [[terminology]] of neoclassical economics is so ecologically illiterate as to rarely even refer to natural resources or ecological limits;&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|121–123}} and that neoclassical economics has developed to become a dominant [[Neoliberalism|free market ideology]] legitimizing an ideal of society resembling a [[Perpetual motion|perpetual motion machine]] of [[economic growth]] at intolerable environmental and human costs.&lt;ref name=jb01/&gt;{{rp|145–148}}

Taken together, it has been argued that "... if Judeo-Christian [[monotheism]] took nature out of religion, Anglo-American economists (after about 1880) took nature out of economics."&lt;ref name=hd04/&gt;{{rp|xx}} Almost one century later, Herman Daly has 
reintegrated nature into economics in his concept of a steady-state economy ([[#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|see below]]).

=== John Maynard Keynes's concept of reaching saturation ===
{{Main|John Maynard Keynes}}
{{See also|Great Depression|Keynesian economics|Macroeconomics}}
{{Further|The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money}}

[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|Keynes predicted that capital accumulation would soon reach saturation and bring about a quasi-stationary community]]
[[John Maynard Keynes]] was the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of modern [[macroeconomics]], and is widely considered today to be the most influential economist of the 20th century. Keynes rejected the basic tenet of classical economics that [[Keynesian economics#Keynes and the classics|free markets would lead to full employment by themselves]]. Consequently, he recommended government intervention to stimulate [[aggregate demand]] in the economy, a macroeconomic policy now known as [[Keynesian economics]]. Keynes also believed that capital accumulation would reach saturation at some point in the future.

In his essay from 1930 on ''The Economic Possibilities of Our Grandchildren'', Keynes ventured to look one hundred years ahead into the future and predict the standard of living in the 21st century. Writing at the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], Keynes rejected the prevailing "bad attack of economic pessimism" of his own time and foresaw that by 2030, the grandchildren of his generation would live in a state of abundance, where saturation would have been reached. People would find themselves liberated from such economic activities as saving and capital accumulation, and be able to get rid of 'pseudo-moral principles' — avarice, exaction of interest, love of money — that had characterized [[Capitalism|capitalistic societies]] so far. Instead, people would devote themselves to the true art of life, to live "wisely and agreeably and well." Mankind would finally have solved "the economic problem," that is, the struggle for existence.&lt;ref name=jmk01/&gt;&lt;ref name=lp01/&gt;{{rp|2, 11}}

The similarity between John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state ([[#John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state|see above]]) and Keynes's predictions in this essay has been noted.&lt;ref name=lp01/&gt;{{rp|15}} It has been argued that although Keynes was right about future growth rates, he underestimated the inequalities prevailing today, both within and across countries. He was also wrong in predicting that greater wealth would induce more leisure spent; in fact, the reverse trend seems to be true.&lt;ref name=lp01/&gt;{{rp|3–6}}

In his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', Keynes looked only one generation ahead into the future and predicted that state intervention balancing aggregate demand would by then have caused capital accumulation to reach the point of saturation. The marginal efficiency of capital as well as the rate of interest would both be brought down to zero, and — if population was not increasing rapidly — society would finally "... attain the conditions of a quasi-stationary community where change and progress would result only from changes in technique, taste, population and institutions ..."&lt;ref name=jmk02/&gt;{{rp|138f}} Keynes believed this development would bring about the disappearance of the rentier class, something he welcomed: Keynes argued that rentiers incurred no sacrifice for their earnings, and their savings did not lead to productive investments unless aggregate demand in the economy was sufficiently high. "I see, therefore, the rentier aspect of capitalism as a transitional phase which will disappear when it has done its work."&lt;ref name=jmk02/&gt;{{rp|237}}

=== Post-war economic expansion and emerging ecological concerns ===
The economic expansion following [[World War II]] took place while [[mainstream economics]] largely neglected the importance of [[natural resource]]s and [[Natural environment|environmental constraints]] in the development. Addressing this discrepancy, ecological concerns emerged in academia around 1970. Later on, these concerns developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an academic subdiscipline in economics.

==== Post-war economic expansion and the neglect of mainstream economics ====
{{See also|Environmentalism #Post-war expansion}}
After the ravages of [[World War II]], the industrialised part of the world experienced almost three decades of unprecedented and prolonged economic expansion. This expansion — known today as the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]] — was brought about by international financial stability, low [[Price of oil|oil prices]] and ever increasing labour productivity in manufacturing. During the era, all the advanced countries who founded — or later joined — [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|the OECD]] enjoyed robust and sustained growth rates as well as full employment. In the 1970s, the expansion ended with the [[1973 oil crisis]], resulting in the [[1973–75 recession]] and the [[Bretton Woods system#Paralysis of international monetary management|collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary system]].

Throughout this era, [[mainstream economics]] — dominated by both [[neoclassical economics]] and [[Keynesian economics]] — developed theories and models where natural resources and environmental constraints were neglected.&lt;ref name=rc01/&gt;{{rp|46f}} &lt;ref name=mc01/&gt;{{rp|3f}} [[Conservation (ethic)|Conservation issues]] related specifically to [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] were left to specialists in the subdiscipline of [[environmental economics]] at the margins of the mainstream. As the theoretical framework of neoclassical economics — namely [[general equilibrium theory]] — was uncritically adopted and maintained by even environmental economics, this subdiscipline was rendered largely unable to consider important issues of concern to environmental policy.&lt;ref name=cs01/&gt;{{rp|416–422}}

In the years around 1970, the widening discrepancy between an ever-growing world economy on the one hand, and a mainstream economics discipline not taking into account the importance of natural resources and environmental constraints on the other hand, was finally addressed — indeed, ''challenged'' — in academia by a few unorthodox economists and researchers.&lt;ref name=ir01/&gt;{{rp|296–298}}

==== Emerging ecological concerns ====
During the short period of time from 1966 to 1972, four works were published addressing the importance of natural resources and the environment to human society:

* In his 1966 philosophical-minded essay on ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth'', economist and systems scientist [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] argued that mankind would soon have to adapt to economic principles much different than the past 'open earth' of illimitable plains and exploitative behaviour. On the basis of the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic principle]] of the [[First law of thermodynamics|conservation of matter and energy]], Boulding developed the view that the flow of natural resources through the economy is a rough measure of the [[Gross national product]] (GNP); and, consequently, that society should start regarding the GNP as a cost to be minimized rather than a benefit to be maximized. Therefore, mankind would have to find its place in a cyclical ecological system without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution — like a [[Astronaut|spaceman]] on board a [[Spacecraft|spaceship]]. Boulding was not the first to make use of the '[[Spaceship Earth]]' metaphor, but he was the one who combined this metaphor with the analysis of natural resource flows through the economy.&lt;ref name=kb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=mc01/&gt;{{rp|104}}
* In his 1971 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], [[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] integrated the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic concept]] of [[entropy]] with economic analysis, and argued that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity. What happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable natural resources) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless waste and pollution).&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt; In the [[history of economic thought]], Georgescu-Roegen was also the first economist of some standing to theorise on the premise that all of earth's [[Mineral|mineral resources]] will eventually be exhausted at some point ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ag01/&gt;{{rp|13}} &lt;ref name=kb02/&gt;{{rp|164f}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|160–171}}
* Also in 1971, pioneering ecologist and general systems analyst [[Howard T. Odum]] published his book on ''Environment, Power and Society'', where he described human society in terms of [[ecology]]. He formulated the [[maximum power principle]], according to which all organisms, ecosystems and human societies organise themselves in order to maximize their use of available energy for survival. Odum pointed out that those human societies with access to the higher quality of [[Energy development#Types of energy|energy sources]] enjoyed an advantage over other societies in the [[Natural selection|Darwinian evolutionary struggle]]. Odum later co-developed the concept of [[emergy]] (i.e., [[embodied energy]]) and made other valuable contributions to ecology and systems analysis. His work provided the biological term 'ecology' with its broader societal meaning used today.&lt;ref name=ho01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rc01/&gt;{{rp|68–71}} &lt;ref name=cc01/&gt;{{rp|14f}}

{{anchor|LtG}}
* In 1972, scientist and systems analyst [[Dennis Meadows]] and his team of researchers had their study on ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' published by the [[Club of Rome]]. The Meadows team modelled aggregate trends in the [[world economy]] and made the projection — ''not'' prediction — that by the mid to latter part of the 21st century, industrial production per capita, food supply per capita and [[world population]] would all reach a peak, and then rapidly decline in a vicious [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse trajectory]].&lt;ref name=dm02/&gt; Due to its dire pessimism, the study was scorned and dismissed by most mainstream economists at the time of its publication.&lt;ref name=mc01/&gt;{{rp|244f}} &lt;ref name=jn01/&gt;{{rp|60f}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|50–62}} However, well into the 21st century, several independent researchers have confirmed that world economic trends so far do indeed match up to the original 'standard run' projections made by the Meadows team, indicating that a global collapse may still loom large in the not too distant future.&lt;ref name=ch01/&gt;{{rp|230}} &lt;ref name=aj01/&gt;{{rp|8f}} &lt;ref name=hs01/&gt;{{rp|152–155}} &lt;ref name=gt01/&gt;&lt;ref name=tj02/&gt;{{rp|8}}
Taken together, these four works were seminal in bringing about the formation of ecological economics later on.&lt;ref name=ir01/&gt;{{rp|301–305}}

==== Formation of ecological economics as an academic subdiscipline ====
{{Main article| Ecological economics}}
Although most of the theoretical and foundational work behind ecological economics was in place by the early 1970s, a long gestation period elapsed before this new academic subdiscipline in economics was properly named and institutionalized. Ecological economics was formally founded in 1988 as the culmination of a series of conferences and meetings through the 1980s, where key scholars interested in the ecology-economy interdependency were interacting with each other. The most important people involved in the establishment were [[Herman Daly]] and [[Robert Costanza]] from the US; AnnMari Jansson from Sweden; and [[Joan Martinez Alier|Juan Martínez-Alier]] from Spain (Catalonia).&lt;ref name=ir01/&gt;{{rp|308–310}} Since 1989, the discipline has been organised in the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] that publishes the journal of [[Ecological Economics (journal)|''Ecological Economics'']].

When the ecological economics subdiscipline was established, Herman Daly's 'preanalytic vision' of the economy was widely shared among the members who joined in: The human economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment), and any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing. Indeed, it has been argued that the subdiscipline itself was born out of frustration with the unwillingness of the established disciplines to accept this vision.&lt;ref name=ir02/&gt;{{rp|266}} However, ecological economics has since been overwhelmed by the influence and domination of neoclassical economics and its everlasting [[Neoliberalism|free market orthodoxy]]. This development has been deplored by activistic ecological economists as an 'incoherent', 'shallow' and overly 'pragmatic' slide.&lt;ref name=ba01/&gt;&lt;ref name=cs02/&gt;&lt;ref name=gp01/&gt;

Since the 1970s, [[Herman Daly]] has been the world's leading proponent of a steady-state economy.&lt;ref name=ma01/&gt;{{rp|81f}} Throughout his career, Daly has published several books and articles on the subject.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;&lt;ref name=hd03/&gt;{{rp|117–124}} &lt;ref name=hd05/&gt; He has also helped founding a center for the advancement of the steady-state economy.&lt;ref name=casse/&gt; He has received several prizes and awards in recognition of his work.&lt;ref name=cr01/&gt;

According to two independent comparative studies of American Daly's steady-state economics versus the later, competing school of [[degrowth]] from continental Europe, no differences of analytical substance exist between the two schools; only, Daly's [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] — or even [[Technocracy|technocratic]] — top-down management of the economy fares badly with the more radical [[grassroots]] appeal of degrowth, as championed by French political scientist [[Serge Latouche]] ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|549}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|146–148}}

[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Natural resources flow through the economy only to end up as waste and pollution in the environment]]
The premise underlying Daly's concept of a steady-state economy is that the economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment). The economy is maintained by importing low-entropy matter-energy (resources) from nature; these resources are put through the economy, being transformed and manufactured into goods along the way; eventually, the throughput of matter-energy is exported to the environment as high-entropy waste and pollution. [[Recycling]] of material resources is possible, but only by using up some energy resources as well as an additional amount of other material resources; and energy resources, in turn, cannot be recycled at all, but are dissipated as [[waste heat]]. Out of necessity, then, any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}

Daly argues that nature has provided basically two sources of wealth at man's disposal, namely a stock of terrestrial [[Mineral resource classification|mineral resources]] and a flow of [[solar energy]]. An 'asymmetry' between these two sources of wealth exist in that we may — within some practical limits — extract the mineral stock at a rate of our own choosing (that is, rapidly), whereas the flow of solar energy is reaching earth at a rate beyond human control. Since the [[Sun]] will continue to shine on earth at a fixed rate for billions of years to come, it is the terrestrial mineral stock — and not the Sun — that constitutes the crucial scarcity factor regarding man's economic future.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|21f}}

[[File:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Unintentionally, the Industrial Revolution has thrown modern man out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere]]
Daly points out that today's global ecological problems are rooted in man's historical record: Until the [[Industrial Revolution]] that took place in Britain in the second half of the 18th century, man lived within the limits imposed by what Daly terms a 'solar-income budget': The [[Palaeolithic]] tribes of hunter-gatherers and the later agricultural societies of the [[Neolithic]] and onwards subsisted primarily — though not exclusively — on earth's [[biosphere]], powered by an ample supply of renewable energy, received from the Sun. The Industrial Revolution changed this situation completely, as man began extracting the terrestrial mineral stock at a rapidly increasing rate. The original solar-income budget was thereby broken and supplemented by the new, but much scarcer source of wealth. Mankind still lives in the after-effect of this revolution.

Daly cautions that more than two hundred years of worldwide industrialisation is now confronting mankind with a range of problems pertaining to the future existence and survival of our species:

{{cquote|The entire evolution of the biosphere has occurred around a fixed point — the constant solar-energy budget. Modern man is the only species to have broken the solar-income budget constraint, and this has thrown him out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere. Natural cycles have become overloaded, and new materials have been produced for which no natural cycles exist. Not only is geological capital being depleted, but the basic life-support services of nature are impaired in their functioning by too large a throughput from the human sector.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|23}}}}

Following the work of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly argues that the laws of [[thermodynamics]] restrict all [[technology|human technologies]] and apply to all economic systems:

{{cquote|[[Entropy]] is the basic physical coordinate of scarcity. Were it not for entropy, we could burn the same gallon of gasoline over and over, and our capital stock would never wear out. Technology is unable to rise above the basic laws of physics, so there is no question of ever 'inventing' a way to recycle energy.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|36}}}}

This view on the role of technology in the economy was later termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']] ([[#Role of technology|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}}

In Daly's view, mainstream economists tend to regard natural resource scarcity as only a relative phenomenon, while human needs and wants are granted absolute status: It is believed that the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|price mechanism]] and [[Technology|technological development]] (however defined) is capable of overcoming any scarcity ever to be faced on earth; it is also believed that all human wants could and should be treated alike as absolutes, from the most basic necessities of life to the extravagant and insatiable craving for luxuries. Daly terms this belief 'growthmania', which he finds pervasive in modern society. In opposition to the dogma of growthmania, Daly submits that "... there ''is'' such a thing as absolute scarcity, and there ''is'' such a thing as purely relative and trivial wants".&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|41}} Once it is recognised that scarcity is imposed by nature in an absolute form by the laws of thermodynamics and the finitude of earth; and that some human wants are only relative and not worthy of satisfying; then we are all well on the way to the paradigm of a steady-state economy, Daly concludes.

{{anchor|Daly's institutions}}
[[File:Bingham Canyon April 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |The inevitable exhaustion of mined resources could be postponed by imposing permanent quantitative restrictions on the economy]]
Consequently, Daly recommends that a system of permanent government restrictions on the economy is established as soon as possible, a steady-state economy. Whereas the [[Classical economics|classical economists]] believed that the final stationary state would settle by itself as the rate of profit fell and capital accumulation came to an end ([[#The stationary state in classical economics|see above]]), Daly wants to create the steady-state politically by establishing three institutions of the state as a superstructure on top of the present market economy:

* The first institution is to correct inequality to some extent by putting minimum and maximum limits on incomes, maximum limits on wealth, and then redistribute accordingly.
* The second institution is to stabilise the population by issuing transferable reproduction licenses to all fertile women at a level corresponding with the general replacement fertility in society.
* The third institution is to stabilise the level of capital by issuing and selling depletion quotas that impose quantitative restrictions on the flow of resources through the economy. Quotas effectively minimise the throughput of resources necessary to maintain any given level of capital (as opposed to taxes, that merely alter the prevailing price structure).

The purpose of these three institutions is to stop and prevent further growth by combining what Daly calls "a nice reconciliation of efficiency and equity" and providing "the ecologically necessary macrocontrol of growth with the least sacrifice in terms of microlevel freedom and variability."&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|69}}

Among the generation of his teachers, Daly ranks [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] as the two economists he has learned the most from.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xvi}} However, both Georgescu-Roegen and Boulding have assessed that a steady-state economy may serve only as a temporary societal arrangement for mankind when facing the long-term issue of global mineral resource exhaustion: Even with a constant stock of people and capital, and a minimised (yet constant) flow of resources put through the [[world economy]], earth's mineral stock will still be exhausted, although at a slower rate than is presently the situation ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|366–369}} 
&lt;ref name=kb02/&gt;{{rp|165–167}}

{{Anchor|Daly's credo}}
Responding specifically to the [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Criticising Daly.27s steady-state economics|criticism levelled at him by Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly concedes that a steady-state economy will serve only to postpone, and not to prevent, the inevitable mineral resource exhaustion: "A steady-state economy cannot last forever, but neither can a growing economy, nor a declining economy".&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369}} A frank and committed [[Protestantism|Protestant]], Daly further argues that...

{{cquote|... the steady-state economy is based on the assumption that [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] will have an end — that it is finite temporally as well as spatially. ... Only [[God]] can raise any part of his creation out of time and into [[eternity]]. As mere stewards of creation, all we can do is to avoid wasting the limited capacity of creation to support present and future life.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|370}}}}

Later, several other economists in the field have agreed that not even a steady-state economy can last forever on earth.&lt;ref name=mr01/&gt;{{rp|90f}} &lt;ref name=mf01/&gt;{{rp|105–107}} &lt;ref name=mb03/&gt;{{rp|270}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548}} &lt;ref name=av01/&gt;{{rp|37}}

== Conceptual and ideological disagreements ==
{{See also| Economic growth #Environmental and physical constraints}}
Several conceptual and ideological disagreements presently exist concerning the steady-state economy in particular and the dilemma of growth in general. The following issues are considered below: The role of technology; resource decoupling and the rebound effect; a declining-state economy; the possibility of having capitalism without growth; and the possibility of pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space. Herman Daly's approach to these issues are presented throughout the text.

=== Role of technology ===
{{See also | Productivity improving technologies | Production function | Pessimism #Entropy pessimism }}
[[Technology]] is usually defined as the application of scientific method in the production of goods or in other social achievements. Historically, technology has mostly been developed and implemented in order to [[Productivity improving technologies|improve labour productivity]] and increase living standards. In economics, disagreement presently exists regarding 
the role of technology when considering its dependency on natural resources:

* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the one hand, the role of 'technology' is usually represented as yet another [[Factors of production#Neoclassical economics|factor of production]] contributing to [[economic growth]], like land, labour and capital contribute. However, in neoclassical [[production function]]s, where the output of produced goods are related to the inputs provided by the factors of production, no mention is made of the contribution of natural resources to the production process. Hence, 'technology' is reified as a separate, self-contained device, capable of contributing to production without receiving any natural resource inputs beforehand. This representation of 'technology' also prevails in standard [[mainstream economics]] textbooks on the subject.&lt;ref name=cm01/&gt;{{rp|508f}} &lt;ref name=rc02/&gt;{{rp|813–816}} &lt;ref name=tt02/&gt;{{rp|409f}}

[[File:2012 09 03 Brückenfahrstand Voraus DSCI73357.JPG|thumb|Technology is usually dependent on fuel or electricity for its operation]]
* In [[ecological economics]], on the other hand, 'technology' is represented as the way natural resources are transformed in the production process.&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|121f}} Hence, Herman Daly argues that the role of technology in the economy cannot be properly conceptualized without taking into account the flow of natural resources necessary to support the technology itself: An [[internal combustion engine]] runs on [[fuel]]s; [[Electric machine|machinery]] and electric devices run on [[electricity]]; all [[Capital (economics)|capital equipment]] is made out of material resources to begin with. In physical terms, any technology — useful though it is — works largely as a medium for transforming valuable [[natural resource]]s into material goods that eventually end up as valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]], thereby increasing the [[entropy]] — or disorder — of the [[Heat death of the universe|world as a whole]].&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|18–25}} This view of the role of technology in the economy has been termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']].&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}}

From the ecological point of view, it has been suggested that the disagreement boils down to a matter of teaching some elementary [[physics]] to the uninitiated neoclassical economists and other [[Technology#Optimism|technological optimists]].&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|15–19}} &lt;ref name=js01/&gt;{{rp|106–109}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|80f}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|116–118}} From the neoclassical point of view, leading growth theorist and [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Robert Solow]] has defended his much criticised position by replying in 1997 that 'elementary physics' has not by itself prevented growth in the industrialized countries so far.&lt;ref name=hd06/&gt;{{rp|134f}}

=== Resource decoupling and the rebound effect ===
{{See also| Sustainability #Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth| Jevons paradox| Rebound effect (conservation)}}

Resource decoupling occurs when economic activity becomes less intensive ecologically: A declining input of natural resources is needed to produce one unit of output on average, measured by the ratio of total natural resource consumption to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). ''Relative'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines on a ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' assumption — that is, all other things being equal. ''Absolute'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines, even while GDP is growing.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|67f}}

[[File:PSM V11 D660 William Stanley Jevons.jpg|thumb|upright|Jevons analysed the effect of increasing energy efficiency]]
In the [[history of economic thought]], [[William Stanley Jevons]] was the first economist of some standing to analyse the occurrence of resource decoupling, although he did not use this term. In his 1865 book on ''[[The Coal Question]]'', Jevons argued that an increase in energy efficiency would by itself lead to ''more'', not less, consumption of energy: Due to the [[Income–consumption curve|income effect]] of the lowered energy expenditures, people would be rendered better off and demand even more energy, thereby outweighing the initial gain in efficiency. This mechanism is known today as the [[Jevons paradox]] or the [[Rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]]. Jevons's analysis of this seeming paradox formed part of his general concern that Britain's industrial supremacy in the 19th century would soon be set back by the inevitable exhaustion of the country's coal mines, whereupon the geopolitical balance of power would tip in favour of countries abroad possessing more abundant mines.&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|160–163}} &lt;ref name=rs01/&gt;{{rp|40f}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|64f}}

In 2009, two separate studies were published that — among other things — addressed the issues of resource decoupling and the rebound effect: German scientist and politician [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker]] published [[Factor 5 (book)|''Factor Five: Transforming the Global Economy through 80% Improvements in Resource Productivity'']], co-authored with a team of researchers from [[The Natural Edge Project]].&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt; British ecological economist [[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]] published ''[[Prosperity Without Growth]]'', drawing extensively from an earlier report authored by him for the UK [[Sustainable Development Commission]].&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt; Consider each in turn:
* Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker argues that a new economic wave of innovation and investment — based on increasing resource productivity, [[renewable energy]], [[industrial ecology]] and other green technology — will soon kick off a 'Green Kondratiev' cycle, named after the Russian economist [[Nikolai Kondratiev]].&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt;{{rp|11–18}} This new long-term cycle is expected to bring about as much as an 80 percent increase in resource productivity, or what amounts to a 'Factor Five' improvement of the gross input per output ratio in the economy, and reduce environmental impact accordingly, von Weizsäcker promises. Regarding the adverse rebound effect, von Weizsäcker notes that "... efforts to improve efficiency have been fraught with increasing overall levels of consumption."&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt;{{rp|306}} As remedies, von Weizsäcker recommends three separate approaches: Recycling of and imposing restrictions on the use of materials; establishing capital funds from natural resource proceeds for reinvestments in order to compensate for the future bust caused by depletion; and finally, taxing resource consumption so as to balance it with the available supplies.&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt;{{rp|309f}}
* Tim Jackson points out that according to empirical evidence, the world economy has indeed experienced some ''relative'' resource decoupling: In the period from 1970 to 2009, the 'energy intensity' — that is, the energy content embodied in world GDP—decreased by 33 percent;&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|68f}} but as the world economy also kept growing, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have increased by 80 percent during the same period of time.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|71}} Hence, no ''absolute'' energy resource decoupling materialized. Regarding key metal resources, the development was even worse in that not even ''relative'' resource decoupling have materialized in the period from 1990 to 2007: The extraction of [[iron ore]], [[bauxite]], [[copper]] and [[nickel]] was rising faster than world GDP to the effect that "resource efficiency is going in the wrong direction," mostly due to [[Emerging markets|emerging economies]] — notably China — building up their [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|74f}} Jackson concludes his survey by noting that the 'dilemma of growth' is evident when any resource efficiency squeezed out of the economy will sooner or later be pushed back up again by a growing GDP.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|130}} Jackson further cautions that "simplistic assumptions that capitalism's propensity for efficiency will stabilize the climate and solve the problem of resource scarcity are almost literally bankrupt."&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|188}}

Herman Daly has argued that the best way to increase natural resource efficiency (decouple) and to prevent the occurrence of any rebound effects is to impose quantitative restrictions on resource use by establishing a [[Emissions trading|cap and trade system of quotas]], managed by a government agency. Daly believes this system features a unique triple advantage:&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|61–64}}

* Absolute and permanent limits are set on the extraction rate of, use of and pollution with the resources flowing through the economy; as opposed to taxes that merely alter the prevailing price structure without stopping growth; and as opposed to [[Pollution#Pollution control|pollution standards and control]] which are both costly and difficult to enact and enforce.
* More efficiency and recycling efforts are induced by the higher resource prices resulting from the restrictions (quota prices plus regular extraction costs).
* No rebound effects are able to appear, as any temporary excess demand will result only in [[inflation]] or [[shortage]]s, or both — and ''not'' in increased supply, which is to remain constant and limited on a permanent basis.

For all its merits, Daly himself points to the existence of physical, technological and practical limitations to how much efficiency and recycling can be achieved by this proposed system.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|77–80}} The idea of absolute decoupling ridding the economy as a whole of any dependence on natural resources is ridiculed polemically by Daly as 'angelizing GDP': It would work only if we ascended to become [[angel]]s ourselves.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|118}}

=== Declining-state economy ===
{{Distinguish|Recession}}
{{See also|Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Criticising Daly's steady-state economics |Anarcho-primitivism}}
{{Further|Degrowth}}

A declining-state economy is an economy made up of a declining stock of physical wealth (capital) or a declining population size, or both. A declining-state economy is not to be confused with a [[recession]]: Whereas a declining-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, a recession is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a growing or a steady economy.

Proponents of a declining-state economy generally believe that a steady-state economy is not far-reaching enough for the future of mankind. Some proponents may even reject modern [[civilization]] as such, either partly or completely, whereby the concept of a declining-state economy begins bordering on the ideology of [[anarcho-primitivism]], on [[Doomer|radical ecological doomsaying]] or on [[Survivalism#Outline of scenarios and outlooks|some variants of survivalism]].

[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] was the teacher and mentor of Herman Daly and is presently considered the [[Degrowth#Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen|main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement]] that formed in France and Italy in the early 2000s. In his 
paradigmatic [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], Georgescu-Roegen argues that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of earth — that is, earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earth's finite stock of [[Mineral|mineral resources]] is presently [[Mining|being extracted and put to use]]; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind|inevitable future collapse]].&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt; In effect, Georgescu-Roegen points out that the arguments advanced by Herman Daly in support of his steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still!&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|366–369}} Instead of Daly's steady-state economics, Georgescu-Roegen proposed his own so-called 'minimal bioeconomic program', featuring restrictions even more severe than those propounded by his former student Daly [[#Daly's institutions|(see above)]].&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|374–379}} &lt;ref name=jg02/&gt;{{rp|150–153}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142–146}}

American political advisor [[Jeremy Rifkin]], French champion of the [[Degrowth|degrowth movement]] [[Serge Latouche]] and Austrian degrowth theorist Christian Kerschner — who all take their cue from Georgescu-Roegen's work — have argued in favour of declining-state strategies. Consider each in turn:

* In his book on ''[[Entropy: A New World View]]'', Jeremy Rifkin argues that the impending exhaustion of earth's mineral resources will mark the decline of the [[Industrialisation|industrial age]], followed by the advent of a new solar age, based on renewable [[solar power]]. Due to the [[Sunlight#Summary|diffuse, low-intensity property of solar radiation]], this source of energy is uncapable of sustaining industrialism, whether capitalist or socialist. Consequently, Rifkin advocates an [[Anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivist]] future solar economy — or what he terms an 'entropic society' — based on [[anti-consumerism]], [[deindustrialization]], [[counterurbanization]], [[organic farming]] and [[Malthusianism#Modern Malthusianism|prudential restraints on childbirths]].&lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|205–224}} Rifkin cautions that the transition to the solar age is likely to become a troublesome phase in the history of mankind, as the present world economy is so dependent on the non-renewable mineral resources.&lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|253–256}}
* In his manifesto on ''Farewell to Growth'', Serge Latouche develops a strategy of so-called 'ecomunicipalism' to initiate a 'virtuous cycle of quiet contraction' or degrowth of economic activity at the local level of society: Consumption patterns and addiction to work should be reduced; systems of fair taxation and consumption permits should redistribute the gains from economic activity within and among countries; obsolescence and waste should be reduced, products designed so as to make recycling easier. This bottom-up strategy opposes [[overconsumption]] in rich countries as well as emerging, poor countries to aspire this overconsumption of the rich. Instead, the purpose of degrowth is to establish the convivial and sustainable society where people can live better lives whilst working and consuming less.&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|9}} Latouche further cautions that "the very survival of humanity ... means that ecological concerns must be a central part of our social, political, cultural and spiritual preoccupation with human life."&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|103}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|134–138}} 
* In his article on ''Economic de-growth vs. steady-state economy'', Christian Kerschner has integrated the strategy of declining-state, or degrowth, with Herman Daly's concept of the steady-state economy to the effect that degrowth should be considered a path taken by the rich industrialized countries leading towards a globally equitable steady-state economy. This ultra-[[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] path will then make ecological room for poorer countries to catch up and combine into a final world steady-state, maintained at some internationally agreed upon intermediate and 'optimum' level of activity for some period of time — although not forever. Kerschner admits that this goal of a world steady-state may remain unattainable in the foreseeable future, but such seemingly unattainable goals could stimulate visions about how to better approach them.&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548}} &lt;ref name=do02/&gt;{{rp|229}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142–146}}

Herman Daly on his part is not opposed to the concept of a declining-state economy; but he does point out that the steady-state economy should serve as a preliminary first step on a declining path, once the optimal levels of population and capital have been properly defined. However, this first step is an important one:

{{cquote|[T]he first issue remains to stop the momentum of growth and to learn to run a stable economy at historically given initial conditions. ... But we cannot go into reverse without first coming to a stop. Step one is to achieve a steady-state economy at existing or nearby levels. Step two is to decide whether the optimum level is greater or less than present levels. ... My own judgment on these issues lead me to think we have overshot the optimum."&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|52}}}}

Daly concedes that it is 'difficult, probably impossible' to define such optimum levels;&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|52}} even more, in his final analysis Daly agrees with his teacher and mentor Georgescu-Roegen that no defined optimum will be able to last forever ([[#Daly's credo|see above]]).&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369}}

=== Capitalism without growth ===
{{See also|Capitalism #Criticism|Criticism of capitalism #Sustainability |Market failure #Ecological}}
Several [[Political radicalism|radical]] critics of [[capitalism]] have questioned the possibility of ever imposing a steady-state or a declining-state (degrowth) system as a superstructure on top of capitalism.&lt;ref name=rs01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jf01/&gt;&lt;ref name=tt01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rf01/&gt;{{rp|97–100}} &lt;ref name=mm01/&gt;{{rp|45–51}} &lt;ref name=bb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=pa01/&gt; Taken together, these critics point to the following growth dynamics inherent in capitalism:

[[File:Wall Street Bull - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Could capitalism ever stop growing?]]
* In capitalism, economic activity is generally guided by the [[profit motive]], a competitive work [[Ethos#Current usage|ethos]] and the drive to [[Capital accumulation|accumulate capital and wealth]] for its own sake to gratify personal ambition, provide social prestige — or simply to [[Greed|get rich in a hurry]]. Psychologically, these [[Drive theory|drives]] in the work sphere [[Psychological repression|repress]] and [[Cognitive distortion|distort]] biological and social [[Homeostasis#History|homeostasis]] in most people.
* In capitalism, [[employment]]s and [[income]]s depend directly on [[sales]] revenues, that is, on people spending money on the [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of goods and services for sale on the [[Market (economics)|market]]. This dependency creates a [[Money|pecuniary incentive]] to increase sales as much as possible. To this end, much cunning [[advertising]] is devised to manipulate [[Want|human wants]] and prop up consumption patterns, often resulting in lavish and wasteful [[consumerism]].
* In capitalism, the [[financial system]] is based on [[fractional-reserve banking]], enabling commercial banks to hold [[Bank reserves|reserves]] in amounts that are less than their [[Liability (financial accounting)|deposit liabilities]]. This credit creation is multiplying the [[monetary base]] supplied by the [[central bank]] in order to assist private [[corporation]]s expanding their activities.
* In capitalism, [[Productivity improving technologies|technological development exhibits a strong labour-saving bias]], creating the need to provide new employment elsewhere in the economy for workers displaced by the introduction of new technology.
* In capitalism, private corporations generally resist government regulations and restrictions that impede profits and deter [[Investment (macroeconomics)|investment opportunities]]. Attempts to downscale the economy would rapidly degenerate into economic crisis and political instability on this count alone.
* In capitalism, governments need [[tax revenue]]s to service their [[Government debt|debt obligations]], run their institutions and finance their [[Welfare|welfare programmes]] for the benefit of the public. Tax revenues are collected from general economic activity.
* In the capitalist [[world economy]], [[Economic globalization|globalisation]] intensifies competition everywhere, both within and between countries. National governments are compelled to compete and struggle with each other to provide employment, investments, tax revenues and wealth for their own populations.
— In short: There is no end to the systemic and ecologically harmful growth dynamics in modern capitalism, radical critics assert.

Fully aware of the massive growth dynamics of capitalism, Herman Daly on his part poses the rhetorical question whether his concept of a steady-state economy is essentially capitalistic or [[Socialism|socialistic]]. He provides the following answer (written in 1980):

{{cquote|The growth versus steady-state debate really cuts across the old [[Left-wing politics|left]]-[[Right-wing politics|right]] rift, and we should resist any attempt to identify either growth or steady-state with either left or right, for two reasons. First, it will impose a logical distortion on the issue. Second, it will obscure the emergence of a third way, which might form a future synthesis of socialism and capitalism into a steady-state economy and eventually into a fully just and sustainable society.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|367}}}}

Daly concludes by inviting all (most) people — both liberal supporters of and radical critics of capitalism — to join him in his effort to develop a steady-state economy.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|367}}

=== Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space ===
{{Main| Asteroid mining}}
{{See also| Human overpopulation #Extraterrestrial settlement | Space colonization #Reasons| Space manufacturing}}
{{Further|Space advocacy}}

Ever since the beginning of the modern [[Space Age]] in the 1950s, [[Space advocacy|space advocates]] have developed plans for [[Space colonization|colonising space]] in order to counter [[human overpopulation]] and mitigate ecological pressures on earth (if not for other reasons).

[[Image:Spacecolony1.jpg|thumb|right|O'Neill wanted colonists to settle in [[O'Neill cylinder|specially designed cylinders]] in outer space]]
In the 1970s, physicist and space activist [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] developed a large plan to [[Gerard K. O'Neill#Space colonization|build human settlements in outer space]] to solve the problems of overpopulation and limits to growth on earth without recourse to political repression. According to O'Neill's vision, mankind could — and indeed ''should'' — expand on this man-made frontier to many times the current world population and generate large amounts of new wealth in space. Herman Daly countered O'Neill's vision by arguing that a space colony would become subject to much harsher limits to growth — and hence, would have to be secured and managed with much more care and discipline — than a steady-state economy on large and resilient earth. Although the number of individual colonies supposedly could be increased without end, living conditions in any one particular colony would become very restricted nonetheless. Therefore, Daly concluded: "The alleged impossibility of a steady-state on earth provides a poor intellectual launching pad for space colonies."&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369}}

By the 2010s, O'Neill's old vision of space colonisation has long since been turned upside down in many places: Instead of dispatching colonists from earth to live in remote space settlements, some ecology-minded space advocates conjecture that resources could be [[Asteroid mining|mined from asteroids in space]] and transported back to earth for use here. This new vision has the same double advantage of (partly) mitigating ecological pressures on earth's limited mineral reserves while also boosting [[Space exploration|exploration]] and [[Space colonization|colonisation]] of space. The building up of [[Space manufacturing|industrial infrastructure in space]] would be required for the purpose, as well as the establishment of a complete [[supply chain]] up to the level of self-sufficiency and then beyond, eventually developing into a permanent extraterrestrial source of wealth to provide an adequate [[return on investment]] for stakeholders. In the future, such an 'exo-economy' (off-planet economy) could possibly even serve as the first step towards mankind's [[Cosmos|cosmic]] ascension to a 'Type II' civilisation on the hypothetical [[Kardashev scale]], in case such an ascension will ever be accomplished.&lt;ref name=wc01/&gt; &lt;ref name=as02/&gt; &lt;ref name=pm01/&gt;

[[File:Pioneer 10 images the sun.jpg|thumb|right| Astronomically long distances and time scales are ever present in space]]
However, it is yet uncertain whether an off-planet economy of the type specified will develop in due time to match both the volume and the output mix needed to fully replace earth's [[Peak minerals|dwindling mineral reserves]]. Sceptics like Herman Daly and others point to exorbitant earth-to-orbit launch costs of any space mission, inaccurate identification of target asteroids suitable for mining, and remote ''[[in situ]]'' ore extraction difficulties as obvious barriers to success: Investing a lot of terrestrial resources in order to recover only a few resources from space in return is not worthwhile in any case, regardless of the scarcities, technologies and other mission parameters involved in the venture. In addition, even if an off-planet economy could somehow be established at some future point, one long-term predicament would then loom large regarding the continuous mining and transportation of massive volumes of materials from space back to earth: How to keep up that volume flowing on a steady and permanent basis in the face of the [[Astronomy|astronomically]] long distances and time scales ever present in space. In the worst of cases, all of these obstacles could forever prevent any substantial pushing of limits into outer space — and then limits to growth on earth will remain the only limits of concern throughout mankind's entire span of existence.&lt;ref name=hd07/&gt;{{rp|24}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|81–83}} &lt;ref name=te01/&gt; &lt;ref name=ws01/&gt; &lt;ref name=kz01/&gt;

'''Tellurocracy''' (from the Latin ''tellus'' "land" and the Greek κράτος "power") is a type of civilization or state system that is clearly associated with the development of land territories and consistent penetration into inland territories. Tellurocratic states have a certain territory and the state-forming ethnic majority living on it, around which further expansion takes place. The opposite of tellurocracy is [[thalassocracy]] (maritime empires), although in the pure type of a particular state is rarely observed. Usually there is a combination of tellurocratic characteristics with thalassocratic. In [[political geography]], [[geopolitics]] and [[geo-economics]], the term is used to explain the power of a country through its control over land. For example, prior to their merger, the [[Sultanate of Muscat]] was thalassocratic, but the [[Imamate of Oman]] was landlocked and purely tellurocratic. In addition, it could be said that most or all landlocked states are tellurocracies.

==Defining tellurocracy==
Tellurocracies are generally not purely tellurocratic. In particular, most large tellurocracies have coastlines and not just inland territories, unlike thassalocracies, which historically would generally only have coastlines, and not inland territories. This makes it difficult to define what exactly a tellurocracy is. 

For example, the Mongols [[Mongol invasions of Japan|attempted to conquer Japan]] on multiple occasions. As well, the [[Russian Empire]] conquered [[Russian America]] (now [[Alaska]]) after it reached a point where it could no longer expand eastward by land. Likewise, the [[United States]] [[Alaska Purchase|acquired Alaska]] and incorporated many islands and the [[Panama Canal Zone]] after it could no longer expand westward. It is also worth noting that the largely tellurocratic, continental [[Australia]], founded as a group of thalassocratic colonies, now holds its own island territories outside of its mainland, such as [[Christmas Island]].

==Historical tellurocracies==

Many empires of antiquity are noted for being more tellurocratic than their rivals, such as the early [[Roman Republic]] in opposition to its rival [[Carthaginian Empire]], which later as the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]s became a rather thalassocratic, yet still quite tellurocratic rival to the quite purely tellurocratic [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sasanian Empire]]s.

==Dugin's theory==

In [[Alexander Dugin]]'s theory of tellurocracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Lukic|editor1-first=Rénéo|editor2-last=Brint|editor2-first=Michael|title=Culture, politics, and nationalism in the age of globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swKFAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Ashgate|publication-date=2001|page=103|isbn=9780754614364|accessdate=2015-10-12|quote=[[Aleksandr Dugin|Dugin]] defines 'thalassocracy' as 'power exercised thanks to the sea,' opposed to 'tellurocracy' or 'power exercised thanks to the land' [...]. The 'thalassocracy' here is the United States and its allies; the 'tellurocracy' is Eurasia.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following civilizational characteristics are traditionally attributed: a sedentary lifestyle (not excluding migratory colonization), conservatism, the permanence of legal norms, the presence of a powerful bureaucratic apparatus and central authority, strong infantry, but a weak fleet. Traditionally, tellurocracy is attributed to the Eurasian states ([[Qing Empire]], [[Mongol Empire]]), [[Mughal Empire]], etc. although some, such as the early [[United States]] and the [[Brazilian Empire]], have come into being elsewhere. In practice, all these qualities are not always present. Moreover, certain peoples and states evolve over time in one direction or another. Russia before the [[Russian Empire]] was a typical tellurocratic state. After [[Emperor Peter I]], there was a gradual increase in the share of thalassocratic characteristics of the Russian Empire, and then the USSR, which turned into one of the largest naval powers. The [[British Empire]], on the contrary, was for a long time a small, largely thalassocratic state outside of its home islands, but during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries it increased its tellurocratic characteristics (expansion into the [[Australian Outback]] and inland Africa, etc.).

The term Tellurocracy itself was proposed by the Russian [[National Bolshevism|National Bolshevist]] and [[Eurasianism|Eurasianist]] publicist Alexander Dugin, based on the works of the famous [[Third Reich]] and [[West German]] lawyer and theorist of geopolitics [[Carl Schmitt]]. Dugin associates Tellurocracy with Eurasianism, in contrast a perceived association of thalassocracy with [[Atlanticism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8739">'''Internationals Network for Public Schools''' is an educational nonprofit supporting International high schools and academies, serving newly arrived immigrants who are English language learners (ELLs), in New York, California, Kentucky, Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, DC.  Internationals Network also partners with other schools and districts across the country.

==Mission==
The mission of Internationals Network is to provide quality education for recently arrived immigrants by growing and sustaining a strong national network of innovative International High Schools, while broadening our impact by sharing proven best practices and influencing policy for English learners on a national scale.

==History==
Internationals Network’s history of academic success began in 1985 with the founding of the first high school on the campus of LaGuardia Community College, a collaborative effort between the New York City Department of Education and the City University of New York. In response to the many educational challenges faced by English language learners within district schools, The [http://ihsnyc.org/ International High School at LaGuardia] was designed specifically to provide quality education for these students. During the next nine years, two additional International High Schools were opened in Brooklyn and Manhattan. To facilitate interschool collaboration and learning, these schools joined together in 1995 to form the International Schools Partnership. In 2001, a fourth school was established in the Bronx. When the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation initiated educational reform through small school development for those students most underserved, they approached the Partnership to recreate its successful model to promote high school age English language learner achievement across the country.
Born from the International Schools Partnership, [http://www.internationalsnetwork.org Internationals Network for Public Schools] was formalized as a 501(c)3 nonprofit in 2004 to support existing schools and create additional International High Schools nationwide. As an intermediary working closely with local education departments and community based organizations, Internationals now supports 19 International High Schools and Small Learning Communities in New York City, California’s Bay Area, Alexandria,Virginia, and Washington, DC.

Based on Internationals core work – almost 30 years of staff and practitioner experience in developing, refining and adapting the Internationals’ Approach in its schools, Internationals now collaborates nationally with districts, schools and school development partners to bring its professional development services to support educators who teach English language learners across the nation. Additionally, Internationals engages with state and local departments of education to increase policy maker awareness of the regulatory issues that both inhibit and promote best practices in ELL education and immigrant family supports.

==Internationals Approach==
At International high schools, a badge of prestige replaces the “stigma” of immigrant status for students, families, and faculty. The Internationals Approach holds that near native fluency in English and proficiency in a second language are valuable resources when it comes to achieving professional and social success in the United States and the global economy and participating fully in democratic society. In International high schools and academies, every teacher is considered a language teacher as well as a teacher of academic content and skills. The educational process takes place in a heterogeneous, learner-centered, collaborative, and activity-based environment. Students are organized in diverse clusters that often work with the same team of teachers over 1–2 years. Classes are mixed according to age, grade, academic ability, prior schooling, native language, and linguistic proficiency. They are interdisciplinary and rigorous, and the curriculum includes literature, social studies, math, science, the arts, technology, and physical education.

The Internationals’ pedagogical approach to educating English language learners is based upon 5 Core Principles:
# Heterogeneity and collaboration : schools and classrooms are heterogeneous and collaborative structures that build on the strengths of each member of the school community to optimize learning
# Experiential learning : expansion of the 21st century schools beyond the four walls of the building motivates adolescents and enhances their capacity to successfully participate in modern society
# Language and content integration : strong language skills develop most effectively in context and emerge most naturally in a purposeful, language-rich, interdisciplinary, and experiential program
# Localized autonomy and responsibility : linking autonomy and responsibility at every level within a learning community allows all members to contribute to their fullest potential
# One learning model for all : every member of our school community experiences the same learning model, maximizing an environment of mutual academic support. Thus all members of our school community work in diverse, collaborative groups on hands-on projects; put another way, the model for adult learning and student learning mirror each other.

The Internationals Approach to teaching has been studied by researchers at Stanford University School Redesign Network and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.  The Stanford study, led by [[Linda Darling-Hammond]] and her team of researchers, found "the Internationals Network for Public Schools (Internationals) is an important model that originated in New York City and has shown itself to be both successful and adaptable" in California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srnleads.org/resources/publications/ousd/cases/oihs.pdf Kessler, J. (2009). Oakland Unified School District case study: OIHS. Stanford, CA: School Redesign Network at Stanford University].&lt;/ref&gt;  Michelle Fine and a team of researchers from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York found that students at the three oldest International schools outperformed both English Language Learners and Native English Speakers (in New York City) in graduation rates and college going rates. The International schools also maintained lower drop out rates than ELL students and English only students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalsnps.org/pdfs/FineReport.pdf Internationals Network for Public Schools: A Quantitative and Qualitative Cohort Analysis of Graduation and Dropout Rates byMichelle Fine at The Graduate Center, City University of New York June 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the [[Migration Policy Institute]] (MPI) announced the four winners of its inaugural E Pluribus Unum national awards for exceptional immigrant integration initiatives.  Internationals Network for Public Schools was named for its work teaching late-entry immigrant students.

==Students==
Today the network serves approximately 6,000 students annually from 90 countries.  Over 90% of students receive free or reduced price lunch, and 86 percent of students come from low-income families. High percentages of students have had interrupted formal education due to political, social, or economic factors in their native countries. 70 percent of students have been separated from one or both parents during their family's immigration to the United States.

The '''Three-anti Campaign''' (1951) and '''Five-anti Campaign''' (1952) ({{zh|c=三反五反|p=sān fǎn wǔ fǎn}}) were reform movements originally issued by [[Mao Zedong]] a few years after the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] in an effort to rid Chinese cities of [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[enemy of the state|enemies of the state]]. The result turned into a series of campaigns that consolidated Mao's power base by targeting political opponents and [[capitalism|capitalist]]s, especially wealthy capitalists.&lt;ref name="Dillon"&gt;Dillon, Michael. [1998] (1998). China: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary.  Routledge publishing. {{ISBN|0-7007-0439-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Three-anti campaign==

The Three-anti Campaign was launched in [[Manchuria]] at the end of 1951.  It was aimed at members within the [[Communist Party of China]], former [[Kuomintang]] members and bureaucratic officials who were not party members.&lt;ref name=Spence&gt;Spence, Jonathan D.  [1991] (1991).  The Search for Modern China.  WW Norton &amp; Company publishing.  {{ISBN|0-393-30780-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The 3 antis imposed were:'''
* corruption （反贪污）
* waste （反浪费）
* bureaucracy （反官僚主义）&lt;ref name="Lawrence"&gt;Lawrence, Alan.  [2003] (2003).  China since 1919: Revolution and Reform: a Sourcebook.  Routledge.  {{ISBN|0-415-25142-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Five-anti campaign==
The Five-anti campaign was launched in January 1952.  It was designed to target the capitalist class.  The [[Communist Party of China|Communist party]] set a very vague guideline of who could be charged, and it became an all out war against the [[bourgeoisie]] in China.&lt;ref name=Spence /&gt;  [[Deng Xiaoping]] warned the people "not to be corrupted by capitalist thinking".&lt;ref name="Lawrence" /&gt;

'''The 5 antis imposed were:'''
* bribery （反行贿）&lt;ref name=Spence /&gt;
* theft of state property  （反盗骗国家财产）
* tax evasion （反偷税漏税）
* cheating on government contracts （反偷工减料）
* stealing state economic information （反盗窃国家经济情报）.

An estimated 20,000 cadres and 6,000 trained workers began spying on the business affairs of fellow citizens.  The media encouraged compliance with the government policies.  Up to 15,000 trained propagandists were working in [[Shanghai]] by late 1951.&lt;ref name=Spence /&gt;  By February 1952, parades of anti-Capitalist activists went door-to-door to visit business leaders.  It created immense psychological pressure.  Shanghai wards were set up to receive criticism letters from any employees.  As many as 18,000 letters came in the first week of February 1952, and 210,000 came in by the end of the first month.  Cadres of party members would join in on the attack.  Some big companies would voluntarily make 1,000 confessions a day to try to protect themselves from the government.&lt;ref name=Spence /&gt;  A prime example was the Dahua copper company owner who originally over-confessed by claiming to have illegally obtained 50 million [[Chinese yuan|yuan]].  His employees continued to criticize the owner for greater crime until he reconfessed to having obtained 2 billion yuan.&lt;ref name=Spence /&gt;

==Aftermath==
The victims of the antis campaigns were mostly terrified and humiliated, some were killed, and others were sent to labor camps around China. Mao evaluated the situation, saying that "We must probably execute 10,000 to several tens of thousands of embezzlers nationwide before we can solve the problem."&lt;ref name="Mao's Killing Quotas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrichina.org/public/PDFs/CRF.4.2005/CRF-2005-4_Quota.pdf|format=PDF|title=Mao's "Killing Quotas."] Human Rights in China (HRIC). 26 September 2005, at Shandong University|last=Changyu|first=Li|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729194758/http://www.hrichina.org/public/PDFs/CRF.4.2005/CRF-2005-4_Quota.pdf|archivedate=29 July 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Three-Antis Campaign came with harsher punishments, some involving torture {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}, and all found guilty of their confessed or unconfessed crimes were made to pay fines to the government. There were hundreds of thousands of suicides (though it is debatable whether many of these were voluntary) that were a direct result of these campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Short |first=Philip |title=Mao: A Life |publisher=Owl Books |year=2001 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4y6mACbLWGsC&amp;pg=PA437&amp;dq=mao+while+the+worst+among+them+should+be+shot&amp;ei=ipaVSYquJpLmyQTiieWsDw |isbn=0-8050-6638-1 |pages=437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the Communist Party revealed that it would no longer protect private business, and that Chinese capitalists would receive treatment no better than foreign.&lt;ref name=Spence /&gt; The [[Korean War]] initially provided opportunities in [[Northern and southern China|Northern China]], giving rise to a new class of capitalists, many of whom would be prosecuted under the Marxist policies of the Communist Party. Many of these people eventually borrowed money from the government to pay off government fines, creating a complex financial pattern.&lt;ref name=Spence /&gt;  A series of anti campaigns were launched by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;Fisac, Taciana and Fernández-Stembridge, Leila.

The '''Torch Commando''' was born out of the work of the Springbok Legion, a [[South Africa]]n organisation of [[World War II]] [[veterans]], founded in 1941 during the Second World War, and the War Veterans Action Committee established with the involvement of Springbok Legionnaires to appeal to a broader base of ex-servicemen.

It was underwritten by [[Harry Oppenheimer]], through an opaque trust fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52879362 |title=23 May 1952 - Most Powerful Man In South Africa |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=1952-05-23 |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Springbok Legion was initially formed by members of the 9th Recce Battalion of the South African Tank Corps, the Soldiers Interests Committee formed by members of the First South African Brigade in [[Addis Ababa]], and the Union of Soldiers formed by the same brigade in Egypt.

The aims and objectives of the Springbok Legion were enunciated in its 'Soldiers Manifesto'. The Springbok Legion was open to all servicemen regardless of race or gender and was avowedly anti-fascist and anti-racist. Amongst its leading members were servicemen such as [[Joe Slovo]], [[Lionel Bernstein]], [[Wolfie Kodesh]], Jack Hodgson and Fred Carneson who all later joined the [[African National Congress]] and its military wing [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] under the command of [[Nelson Mandela]]. Others such as [[Harry Schwarz]], a later well-known anti-apartheid political leader, lawyer and ambassador to the United States during the government of national unity was one of the organisation's founders. Another member was General [[Kennie van der Spuy]], one of the founding members of the South African Air Force who fought in both World War I and World War II and was captured and imprisoned in the Kremlin by the Russians after fighting alongside the White Russian forces against the communists and held until 1920.

The Torch Commando was founded in 1951 during the [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]], in protest against the South African government's plan to remove [[coloured]]s from the voters roll in the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]]. At a time when the Springbok Legion's numbers were diminishing, the Torch Commando strategy gave a new lease of life to the aims and objectives of the Springbok Legion, perceived as being too left wing by some, and gave a home to whites in other liberal formations including liberals in the United Party, who identified with black grievances.

The wartime RAF fighter ace Group Captain [[Adolph Malan]] became the president of the 'Torch Commando'. The commando's main activities were torchlight marches, from which they took their name. The largest march attracted 75,000 protesters.

The Torch Commando existed for more than five years, and at its height claimed to have had 250,000 members. The government was alarmed by the number of judges, public servants and military officers joining the organisation, and a new law was passed to ban anyone in public service or the military from joining. Subsequently the National Party did everything to purge the memory of the Springbok Legion, Torch Commando and men such as 'Sailor' Malan, who had appeal with white [[Afrikaner]] youth.

== Founding ==
The community was founded on a {{convert|123|acre|km2|sing=on}} tobacco farm in 1967&lt;ref name="Other American Dream" /&gt; by a group of eight individuals with no farming experience that included [[Kat Kinkade]], who wrote two books about the community.&lt;ref name="WaldenII"&gt;Kinkade, Kat 1974 ''A Walden Two Experiment; The First Five Years of Twin Oaks Community. ''William Morrow &amp; Co . {{ISBN|0-688-05020-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IsItUtopia"&gt;Kat Kinkade, 1994 "Is It Utopia Yet?: An Insider's View of Twin Oaks Community in Its Twenty-Sixth Year" Twin Oaks Publishing; 2nd edition (August 1994). {{ISBN|0-9640445-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community's initial inspiration was [[B. F. Skinner]]'s novel ''[[Walden Two]],'' which describes a fictional [[behaviourist|behaviorist]] [[utopia]].  However, Skinner's vision quickly faded from prominence at Twin Oaks, as behaviorist principles were abandoned in favor of egalitarian principles.  The community struggled greatly during its first few years, as member turnover was high and the community members didn't earn much income.  According to Kinkade, the community avoided the problems stereotypically associated with communes (particularly laziness, freeloading, and excessive lack of structure) by adopting a structured, yet flexible, labor system.&lt;ref&gt;Kinkade K., Is it Utopia Yet ?, page 29, Twin Oaks Publishing, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

Modified versions of the community's initial organizational structure and labor credit system survive to this day. As in Skinner's novel, the original labor credit system utilized "variable" credit hours. Certain jobs were worth more credit hours than others in order to make each job desirable.  What the community found once the population reached about 40 is that there was neither universally desirable work, nor undesirable work and the variable credit hour system created distortions in which work was getting done. The modified version of this plan in place today uses "standardized" credits; each job in the community is valued the same in terms of credit hours.&lt;ref name="Spalding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twinoaks.org/community/media/academic/thesis.html|title=Positioned Within 'The Outside World' The Cultural Construction Of Gender In An Egalitarian Intentional Community|last=Spalding|first=Ashley|year=2000|work=Dep't of Anthropology, University of South Carolina|publisher=(hosted at twinoaks.org)|accessdate=13 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226040515/http://twinoaks.org/community/media/academic/thesis.html|archive-date=2010-12-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before a new member can join, while the community is at its population capacity, a current member needs to drop membership. Historically, Twin Oaks has expanded its housing when it has had a waiting list for a prolonged period by building new residences and expanding the stock of bedrooms available.&lt;ref name="IsItUtopia" /&gt;

Most Twin Oakers perform a wide variety of tasks each week instead of spending all of their time in one labor area.&lt;ref name="notQuite" /&gt; Members can also choose to work outside of Twin Oaks.&lt;ref name="Other American Dream" /&gt; The income from this labor may go to the community, although some portion of it can go into a member's "vacation earnings". Excess labor done in a week accumulates as vacation time.

Though live television viewing is prohibited, Twin Oaks' members have access to the Internet as well as to public computers. Members can also watch movies and tapes of TV programs. People in the community often gather for other recreational activities such as dancing, meditating, discussing literature, staging musicals, and playing board games.&lt;ref name="Other American Dream" /&gt;

Twin Oaks members are religiously diverse. The membership includes [[Christians]], [[Atheists]], [[paganism|Pagans]], [[Buddhists]], and others. The community hosts Pagan [[Handfasting (Neopaganism)|handfasting]]s, Equinox parties, and Thanksgiving dinners, and it celebrates June 16, the anniversary of its founding.

Residents live in dormitory-style living quarters spread out across the community. Each member has a private bedroom, but shares public spaces.&lt;ref name="Voice of America" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC Richmond" /&gt;

Member turnover is no longer as high as it was in the community's early years,&lt;ref name="Other American Dream" /&gt; and many former Twin Oakers live in nearby [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] and [[Louisa, Virginia|Louisa]] to maintain ties to the community.

== Community businesses ==
Twin Oaks' 42-hour work week is divided between domestic and income-producing labor.&lt;ref name="mojo" /&gt; Twin Oaks operates several community-owned businesses, including Twin Oaks Tofu, Twin Oaks Hammocks, and Twin Oaks Book Indexing. Additionally, members working in the Twin Oaks Seed Farm grow seeds for [[Southern Exposure Seed Exchange]]. From these sources, Twin Oaks generates around $600,000 per year.&lt;ref name="NBC 29" /&gt; This money pays for community upkeep and goods that cannot be produced on site, and each member receives a monthly [[stipend]] for personal use (i.e., to purchase items that the community does not provide). In news segments, Twin Oakers often attribute the longevity of the community to its engagement in [[capitalism]] through its tofu and hammocks businesses.&lt;ref name="mojo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voice of America" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC Richmond" /&gt;

== Twin Oaks and the communities movement ==
Twin Oaks has helped establish three sister communities: [[Acorn Community]],&lt;ref name="Other American Dream" /&gt; about {{convert|7|mi|km}} from Twin Oaks, [[Living energy farm]], also in Louisa County, Virginia; and [[East Wind Community]] in south central Missouri.

Twin Oaks also hosts annual intentional community gatherings cosponsored by the [[Fellowship for Intentional Community]]. The  Communities Conference,&lt;ref name="cc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communitiesconference.org/|title=Twin Oaks Communities Conference|accessdate=13 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208231356/http://www.communitiesconference.org/|archive-date=2011-02-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Women's Gathering,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.womensgathering.org/ |title=Twin Oaks Women's Gathering |access-date=2011-01-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314224105/http://womensgathering.org/ |archive-date=2011-03-14 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which take place every August.

== Twin Oaks in the media ==
The history of Twin Oaks Community is detailed extensively in two books by Kathleen (Kat) Kinkade, one of the co-founders of the community.  The first, ''A Walden Two Experiment'',&lt;ref name="WaldenII" /&gt; covers the first five years of the community.  The second, ''Is it Utopia Yet?'', covers the next 20 years.&lt;ref name="IsItUtopia" /&gt;  Another book from the 1980s, ''Living the Dream'', by Ingrid Komar (the mother of a member at the time the book was written), also discusses Twin Oaks' history.&lt;ref name="Komar 1983"&gt;{{cite book | last=Komar | first=Ingrid  | title=Living the dream: A documentary study of the Twin Oaks community | publisher=Jerome S. Weiman | series=Communal societies and utopian studies book series | year=1983 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oj2wAAAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;    About half a dozen dissertations and a dozen master's theses have been written about the community, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Academic Articles | website=Twin Oaks Intentional Community | url=http://www.twinoaks.org/twinoaks-media/academic-articles | accessdate=17 January 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609100503/http://www.twinoaks.org/twinoaks-media/academic-articles | archive-date=2017-06-09 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the ''[[Washington Post Magazine]]'' did a cover story on Twin Oaks.&lt;ref name="Other American Dream"/&gt;

==Twin Oaks and ecology==
Twin Oaks seeks to be a model of sustainability.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; The average Twin Oaks member consumes fewer resources than the average American due to the community's practices of resource sharing&lt;ref name="mojo"&gt;{{cite AV media

==Criticism ==
The community itself acknowledges that it has yet to create the perfect society; it even provides a guidebook entitled "Not Utopia Yet" to visitors. For instance, there is little privacy at Twin Oaks.&lt;ref name="Other American Dream" /&gt; Also, those who choose to live at Twin Oaks for several years—including founder Kinkade—sometimes feel "trapped" there. This is because members have little opportunity to build up equity or savings.&lt;ref name="notQuite"&gt;''New York Times Magazine'', 3 August 1997. Daniel Pinchbeck, "Paradise Not Quite Lost," pp. 26-29&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Womanhouse''''' (January 30 – February 28, 1972) was a [[feminist art]] installation and performance space organized by [[Judy Chicago]] and [[Miriam Schapiro]], co-founders of the California Institute of the Arts ([[CalArts]]) [[Feminist Art Program]]. Chicago, Schapiro, their students and women artists from the local community, including [[Faith Wilding]], participated.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23"&gt;Revisiting Womanhouse&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago and Schapiro encouraged their students to use consciousness-raising techniques to generate the content of the exhibition.&lt;ref name="Schapiro 1987 p27"&gt;Recalling Womanhouse&lt;/ref&gt;

Only women were allowed to view the exhibition on its first day, after which the exhibition was open to all viewers. During the exhibition's duration, it received approximately 10,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Site to Vision: The Woman's Building in Contemporary Culture|year=2011|publisher=OTIS School of Art and Design|location=Los Angeles|author=Meyer, Laura|editor=Sondra Hale and Terry Wolverton|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins==

The Feminist Art Program began at the California Institute of the Arts in 1971 after an experimental year at Fresno State College under the name Women's Art Program. The students in the program were admitted as a group when Chicago and Schapiro were hired at Cal Arts after Chicago found that the [[Fresno State College]] Art department was reluctant to embrace her vision of a new kind of female centered art. It was their intention to teach without the use of authoritarian rules or a unilateral flow of power from teacher to student.&lt;ref name="Schapiro pg. 268"&gt;The Education of Women as Artists: Project Womanhouse&lt;/ref&gt;

The Feminist Art Program, was slated to occupy a new building, but found itself without adequate space at the start of the school year in 1971. The lack of appropriate studio space paved the way for a collaborative group project set to highlight the ideological and symbolic conflation of women and houses. The end result of this project was the ''Womanhouse'' installation, built by the students in an abandoned Victorian house just off of the CalArts campus.

The program utilized a method of teaching that relied on group cooperation. Students would sit in a circle, and share their thoughts on a selected topic of discussion. The circular teaching method was intended to provide a "nourishing environment for growth" and to promote a "circular, more womb-like" atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Schapiro pg. 268"/&gt; The goal of these discussions was for each woman to reach a higher level of self-perception, to validate their experiences, as well as the "search for subject matter" to incorporate into artwork and to address their individual aesthetic needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schapiro |first=Miriam |date=Spring 1972 |title=The Education of Women as Artists: Project Womanhouse |jstor=775513  |journal=Art Journal |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=268–270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many students fostered resentments towards Chicago and Schapiro, claiming they were suffering from their own power trips. Chicago insisted her students feelings were the result of their own internalized sexism and unconscious manifestations of their difficulties dealing with female authority figures.&lt;ref&gt;Balducci, Temma. "Revisiting “Womanhouse”: Welcome to the (deconstructed) “Dollhouse”." ''[[Woman's Art Journal]]'' 27, no 2. (2006): 17-23&lt;/ref&gt;

The project's goals, as professed by Schapiro and Chicago, were to help students overcome some problems of being a woman. These included "a general lack of assertiveness or ambition", an "unwillingness to push themselves beyond their limits”, “lack of familiarity with tools and artmaking processes”, and an “inability to see themselves as working people". It was thought that by teaching the women to use power tools and proper building techniques, they would gain confidence and subsequently "restructure their personalities" to be consistent with their artistic goals. It was Schapiro and Chicago's belief that "society fails women by not demanding excellence from them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suzyspence.com/womanhouse/Womanhousecatalogessay.pdf|title=Womanhouse catalog essay|accessdate=2014-04-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611044304/http://www.suzyspence.com/womanhouse/Womanhousecatalogessay.pdf|archivedate=2014-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These techniques were to result in an "exclusively female environment" that included a greater community of female artists. The goal of this community was to expose the students to "established" female artists not limited to Schapiro and Chicago.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Catalog Essay"&gt;Womanhouse Catalog Essay&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paula Harper]], an art historian for the California Institute of Arts Feminist Art Program, is credited for suggesting the idea for ''Womanhouse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phelan|first=Peggy|title=Live Art in LA: Performance in Southern California, 1970-1983|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaoZSpldJZ8C&amp;pg=PA38|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415684224|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schapiro supervised ''Womanhouse'''s dramatic works, while Chicago focused on other media.&lt;ref name="Schapiro 1987 p27"&gt;Recalling Womanhouse&lt;/ref&gt; Their intention was to transform a domestic environment into one that fully expressed the experiences of women.&lt;ref name="Harper pg. 772"/&gt;

"Womanhouse began in an old deserted mansion on a residential street in Hollywood and became an environment in which: “The age-old female activity of homemaking was taken to fantasy proportions. Womanhouse became the repository of the daydreams women have as they wash, bake, cook, sew, clean and iron their lives away." Before creating the art environments and pieces, the students had to do extensive reconstruction on the house which had been empty for many years. They have to fix broken windows and furnitures.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago, Judy. Womanhouse catalog essay.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction/Process ==

The group broke into teams in order to find a suitable location for their "dreams and fantasies".&lt;ref name="Schapiro 1987 p27"&gt;Recalling Womanhouse&lt;/ref&gt;
They found a 17-room,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harper |first=Paula |date=Summer 1985 |title=The First Feminist Art Program: A View from the 1980s |jstor=3174313  |journal=Signs |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=762–781 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 75-year-old dilapidated mansion at 533 N. Mariposa Ave. in a rundown section of Hollywood. Members of the group knocked on doors to find the owner of the house, who one neighbor remarked would "certainly not be interested in the project".

After a visit to the Hall of Records, they found the owner to be Amanda Psalter. The group described their intentions for the house in a letter to the Psalter Family. In response, the house was granted through a special lease agreement&lt;ref name="Harper pg. 772"&gt;First Feminist Art Program&lt;/ref&gt;  for the 3-month duration of the project. After this time, it would be demolished.&lt;ref name="Schapiro 1987 p27" /&gt; Construction spanned from November 1971 to January 1972.&lt;ref name="Harper pg. 772"/&gt;

In order to renovate the house, the women tackled tasks included cleaning, painting, sanding scraping and wallpapering walls, replacing windows, sanding floors, and installing lights. New walls were built for practical and aesthetic reasons and women learned wallpapering techniques to refurbish one of the rooms. Eventually a crew was needed to paint the exterior of the house, install locks and advise the women on basic electrical wiring.&lt;ref name="Schapiro pg. 268"/&gt;

The women struggled as they began renovating the mansion during the winter, as the building did not have hot water, heat, or plumbing.&lt;ref name="Wilding, Faith 1977"&gt;Wilding, Faith. (1977). By Our Own Hands. Double X. 06 October 2014. &lt;http://womanhouse.refugia.net&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Renovations included replacing 25 windows and replacing banisters that had been pulled out by vandals. They worked 8 hour days&lt;ref name="Harper pg. 772"/&gt; in a “manner they were unaccustomed to”, soon coming to resent the intense, “impossible” demands, even coming to see their administrators as “monsters” and complaining that they would fail.“&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Catalog Essay" /&gt; To cope with the frustration of learning new techniques while meeting stringent deadlines, the group held meetings to deal with any problems that arouse and sessions to raise group consciousness.&lt;ref name="Wilding, Faith 1977"/&gt; Some former students now see this tension as a result of Chicago's authoritarian presence, feeling that she imposed her own goals on the group.&lt;ref name="Harper pg. 772"/&gt;

Here are some perspectives from participators when they recall the struggles of ''Womanhouse'' after 25 years later.&lt;ref name="Re:Tracing the Feminist Art Program"&gt;&lt;http://www.encore.at/retracing/index2.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Camille Grey : “Put 30 women together and see what happens. A nightmare.”

Robin Mitchell: " It was simultaneously one of the best and worst experiences of my life.”

Mira Schor: " I left the Program after one year, because of my disagreements, and because I wanted to experience the school outside the confines of the Program. I have avoid group feminism since then.

Nancy Youdelman:" Looking back 25 years later, I have mixed feeling about the Feminist Art Program – We had something really incredible and unique and somehow we could not get beyond personalities and create a lasting support system

In the journal ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'', Paula Harper says, "the young students did not have much personal experience of traditional marriage and homemaking roles of women. Nonetheless, the ideas of all were influenced by the general aim of feminists in the late 1960s to revise women's position in society by bringing attention to their oppression, and this ideology clearly shared by the many individuals involved gave Womanhouse its impact."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harper, Paula. “The First Feminist Art Program: A View from the 1980s.” Signs 10, no.4 (1985): 772.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working collaboratively on ''Womanhouse'', the students gained new skills while developing a deeper understanding of human and personal experiences. The students also provided tours of the exhibition, which gave them the opportunity to articulate their artwork while maintaining their personal vision when faced with criticism.  Even though the exhibition provided the students with great satisfaction and team effort some of the artists didn’t feel any personal accomplishment, and were looking forward to going back to work on their individual projects.&lt;ref name="Wilding, Faith 1977"/&gt;

The mansion contained a variety feminist installations, sculptures, performances and other forms of art. The artists creating ''Womanhouse'' did so, centralizing a white, cisgender, heterosexual and middle-class experience of womanhood in the early seventies.&lt;ref&gt;Balducci, Temma. 2006. "Revisiting ‘Womanhouse’: Welcome to the (deconstructed) “Dollhouse”." ''Woman's Art Journal'' 27, no. 2: 17-23.&lt;/ref&gt; By transforming a "woman's space" (such as a kitchen) into a radical feminist art truly made a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Performance Anthology|year=1989|publisher=Last Gasp Press|location=San Francisco CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here they spoke out about women issues, as well as criticizing the patriarchy. This helped women artists and architects gain recognition and acknowledgement that their work could be seen on the same level as men. Using a mansion as their chosen setting furthered their statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Amelia|title=The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=New York NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rooms/installations ==

'''Nurturant Kitchen''' - ''by Susan Frazier, Vicki Hodgetts, Robin Weltsch''.
Present in the kitchen are plates of food under a line of light bulbs, resembling it to a factory worker's assembly line. This highlights the dehumanizing aspects of a woman's role as nurturer.
* '''Aprons in Kitchen''' - ''by Susan Frazier'' A display in Nurturant Kitchen. Aprons are fashioned with breasts and other female body parts. This allows the female to remove her bodily features when she is done with housework, implying that her physical body is inextricably linked to her societal role. 
* '''Eggs to Breasts''' - Forms cover the ceilings and walls, starting as eggs on the ceiling and gradually transforming into breasts as the pattern continues down. Underscores the woman's traditional role as a nurturer by combining images of the kitchen and of a woman's sagging breasts.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;
'''Dining Room''' - ''by Beth Bachenheimer, Sherry Brody, Karen LeCocq, Robin Mitchell, [[Miriam Schapiro]], [[Faith Wilding]].''
The ''Dining Room'' features a crown molding of lifelike painted fruit. A mural, based on a 19th-century still life by [[Anna Peale]], is displayed on a wall behind the dining room table. The table itself features a bread dough sculpture, turkey, ham, pecan pie, vinyl salad bowl, vinyl wine glasses and a wine bottle. A chandelier hangs above the table. Below the table, a stenciled-rug is painted directly onto the floor.
''Dining Room'' is the most collaborative project in ''Womanhouse'', utilizing the efforts of seven women to complete. It is meant to express a generous, bountiful and romantic aura.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "&gt;Womanhouse.refugia.net&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bridal Staircase''' - ''by Kathy Huberland.''
Features a life-size doll replica of a bride, complete with veil and wedding dress, descending the stairs. She is fixed against the wall on the landing. Gauzy fabric adorns the walls and garlands of green and flowers encircle the bannister.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Personal Environment''' - ''by Judy Huddleston''. Intended by the artist to be "an entirely different world" that transcends the "established plane".&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="womanhouse.refugia.net"/&gt;

'''Crocheted Environment''' - ''by Faith Wilding''. Resembling a "primitive womb shelter", the room is painted black. Crocheted thread covers the wall, and a single light bulb illuminates from the ceiling.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt; 

'''Leaf Room''' - ''by Ann Mills''. A room with painted leaves. The leaves represent cycles; of seasons, life and feelings. They also functioned as symbolic “shields” for the artist, allowing her to both expose herself and hide at the same time.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Leah's Room''' - ''by Karen LeCocq, Nancy Youdelman.''
Lea, a character based on the aging courtesan from [[Colette]]'s novel ''[[Chéri (novel)|Chéri]]'', sits in a watermelon pink bedroom. The performance (performed by LeCocq) occurred continuously on a daily basis, and involved Lea applying makeup meticulously, then removing it, in an endless cycle to illustrate the pain of aging and the deperate process of trying to restone ones beauty.
The performance illustrates the high standards of beauty levied by the pressure of society for women to maintain at all cost. Lea makes continual efforts to keep the attention of a man as her beauty deteriorates with age.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;

'''Personal Space''' - ''by Janice Lester.'' A bedroom that serves as the artist's personal fantasy, a room that only she can enter. The secret room acts as both a sanctuary and a trap.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Painted Room''' - ''by Robin Mitchell." An otherwise white bedroom with painterly splashes of color on the walls and floor.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Red Moon Room''' - ''by Mira Schor.'' A painting features a self portrait of the artist and a rising red moon over rolling hills.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Shoe Closet''' - ''by Beth Bachenheimer.''
Hundreds of pairs of shoes were collected, painted and treated for this installation. A 'spike heel' features real spikes driven from the bottom of the shoe.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt; A closet with a comically extravagant number of shoes conveys the desperate attempt of women to be fashionable.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;

'''Linen Closet''' - ''by Sandy Orgel.''
A female mannequin is installed in the closet, with shelves and drawers bisecting her body parts. Folded towels sit on the shelves.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Lipstick Bathroom''' - ''by Camille Grey.''
A bathroom where every fixture is painted bright, 'Lipstick' red.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt; The room features 200 plastic lipsticks, a fur-lined bathtub, and a female figure painted entirely red. Stage lights were used to light the bathroom.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Menstruation Bathroom''' - ''by [[Judy Chicago]].'' The bathroom is painted a stark white, and a layer of gauze covers the shelves. A single trashcan is overflowing with what appear to be used tampons, a woman's "hidden secret" that cannot be covered up.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Nightmare Bathroom''' - ''by Robbin Schiff.'' A bathtub hosts a woman's figure with most of her body obscured in water, made entirely from loose sand.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''The Dollhouse Room''' - ''by Sherry Brody, [[Miriam Schapiro]].'' According to Schapiro, ''The Dollhouse Room'' juxtaposes themes of "supposed safety and comfort in the home" with "terrors existing within its walls".&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "&gt;Womanhouse.refugia.net&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Dollhouse''' - ''The Dollhouse'' serves as the centerpiece of ''The Dollhouse Room''. It is a six-room miniature house. The artist's studio room contains a miniature nude man atop a pedestal, with an erect penis and bananas at his feet. Downstairs, a miniature woman sits at her dressing table. There are many monsters present in the dollhouse, despite its familiar domestic aspects. To the left of the artist's studio is a nursery with a baby replaced by a monster. Outside the window, peering in, is a grizzly bear. Downstairs, a group of ten men stare in through the kitchen window. A rattlesnake is curled on the parlor floor.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt; ''The Dollhouse'' was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution in 1995 and is the only publicly available piece of ''Womanhouse''.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;
* '''Lingerie Pillows -''' Created by Sherry Brody, the pillows were sewn from underwear and bras and displayed on a small tabletop. Miriam Schapiro related a story that the curator of LACMA came to have a tour of ''Womanhouse.'' In the Dollhouse Room, he picked up one of the pillows and when he realized that he was holding, he was embarrassed.&lt;ref name="Schapiro pg. 268" /&gt; Schapiro recalled that everyone in the room had laughed, but upon reflection she wished that she had questioned his aversion to something delicate, intimate, and feminine.&lt;ref name="Schapiro pg. 268" /&gt;

'''The Nursery''' - ''by Shawnee Wollenman.'' Oversized furniture and toys simulate the feeling of being young, a small person in a big room. Special attention was made to make the space an androgynous, ideal living space for a child.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Garden Jungle''' - ''by Paula Longendyke.'' What resembles the skeletal forms of dead animals is present in the garden area. This is meant to convey the weakness and vulnerability of such animals.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Necco Wafers''' - ''by Christine Rush.'' Pastel colors contrast the otherwise organic colors of the garden. The ground is painted, and "fanciful clouds" create a "fantasy sky".&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

== Performances ==
Workshops led by Judy Chicago were held in the Living Room of the house. Ideas for pieces were derived from "informal working sessions", in which the women acted out aspects of their lives.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Three Women''' - Three 'types' of women are represented; the hustler, the hippie, and the mother. They wear exaggerated makeup are initially meant to be comical. They tell the stories, all 'trapped' in some aspect of being a woman.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Maintenance''' Pieces:  
'''Scrubbing''', ''Performed by Christine Rush'' and '''Ironing''', ''Performed by Sandra Orgel'' - 
Two performance pieces pertaining to maintenance. 
A woman scrubs the floor on all fours with a brush in a continuous, repetitive motion. Another woman irons identical sheets over and over. 
This isolated monotonous tasks for an audience to highlight their performative nature, and how these performances play a role in the construction of gender roles.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;

'''Cock and Cunt play''' - ''Written by [[Judy Chicago]], performed by Janice Lester and [[Faith Wilding]].'' Two characters wearing costumes featuring comically large genitalia converse as "She" and "He", each acting out the roles of their designated sex. "He" argues that her lack of a penis justifies having to do the dishes. This is meant to show how exaggerated essentialist notions about the female body contribute to her role in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] and to reveal the consequences of stereotyping.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;

'''Waiting''' - ''Written by Faith Wilding.'' The actress sits in a rocking chair and slowly recounts how her days were structured around 'waiting' for things to happen; her husband to give her pleasure, her kids to leave home, and waiting for some time for herself.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''The Birth Trilogy''' - In the first section, a group of women stands in a line as they symbolically 'give birth' to one another. The 'babies' in this scenario lay on the ground until their 'mothers' come to hold and nurture them. In the end, all of the women gather in a circle as they chant and sing with heads bowed. The chant grows louder with time, ending in a "peak of ecstatic sound".&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

== Reception ==
''Womanhouse'' was the first feminist art project to receive attention on a national scale following its review by [[Time (magazine)]].
''Womanhouse'' exhibition served as an introduction of feminism to the general public a revolutionary act for the early 1970s, and it sparked lots of debates. One year after ''Womanhouse'' closed, in an article published by ''Ms.'' Magazine: "Many women artists have organized, are shedding their shackles, proudly untying the apron strings--and, in some cases, keeping the apron on, flaunting it, turning it into art."&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Lippard, "Household Images in Art," Ms. 1 (no. 9, March 1973), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cradle of Feminist Art"&gt;&lt; http://www.as-ap.org/content/womanhouse-cradle-feminist-art-sandra-sider-0&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1972 review in the ''Los Angeles Times'' by William Wilson described ''Womanhouse'' as a "lair of female creativity" that "reminds us that the female is our only direct link with the forces of nature".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Lair of Female Creativity|last=Wilson|first=William|date=February 21, 1972|work=The Los Angeles Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he remarks that "man's greatest creative acts may be but envious shadowings of her fecundity"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, this review may have also highlighted stereotypical patriarchal attitudes surrounding connections between women's bodies, the domestic, and nature that ''Womanhouse'' attempted to critique. Paula Harper argued that such language is an attempt by critics to soften the impact of ''Womanhouse'' by assimilating it according to conventions of femininity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some individuals strongly opposed this exhibition. Some critics claimed that radical feminist art projects such as ''Womanhouse'' "undermined aesthetic standards" in the 1970s. Others claimed that it was more therapy than art. Paula Harper challenged this critique, arguing that challenging the definition of art is a "function of the avant-garde”.

Lack of scholarly attention paid to ''Womanhouse'' is attributed to its very early production in the context of Feminist art, its lack of controversiality in relation to other installations of the time (most notably Chicago's own ''[[The Dinner Party]]''), and some accusations of essentialism. However, it is also argued that the piece illustrates, complicates and subverts a "false binary" of essential and constructed identity which enhances its value and relevancy.

=== Influence ===
Artists, artworks, and institutions have been inspired by ''Womanhouse''. The ''Womanhouse'' exhibition cannot be rebuilt, but a few of the rooms have been recreated for special exhibitions. In 1995, for example, the Bronx Museum of the Arts exhibited The Dollhouse by Sherry Brodyand Miriam Schapiro, along with Faith Wilding's Womb Room, a recreation of Judy Chicago's Menstruation Bathroom, and Beth Bachenheimer's Shoe Closet, among others.  ”&lt;ref name="Cradle of Feminist Art" /&gt;

The feminist spirit of ''Womanhouse'' lives on through the website Womenhouse, which was inspired by the groundbreaking 1972 exhibition. [[Faith Wilding]] is among the participants in this collaborative site featuring virtual rooms and domestic spaces. Womenhouse catapults the issues raised by the original exhibition into the twenty-first century, within "a cyber-politics that addresses the multivalent vicissitudes of identity formation and domesticity.”

==Films==
''Womanhouse'' was produced by Johanna Demetrakas. Miriam Schapiro arranged for a 47-minute documentary film to be made about the project and released in the summer of 1972. The project was produced by Johanna Demetrakas under the auspices of the American Film Society and is a part of Women Make Movies and was released in 1974.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Demetrakas was said to be "impressed" and "inspired" by the project.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Catalog Essay" /&gt;

''Womanhouse is Not a Home'' was a film produced by Lynne Littman and directed by Parke Perine. It aired during February 1972 on the local KCET PBS channel.&lt;ref name="womanhouse.refugia.net" /&gt; The film showed the installations, had the women artists speak about their work, and featured a consciousness raising session with [[Gloria Steinem]].  

''Woman's House'' was an experimental film by [[Mako Idemitsu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/181799?artist_id=26369&amp;locale=en&amp;sov_referrer=artist|title=Mako Idemitsu|last=|first=|date=|website=Museum of Modern Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is a thirteen-minute film that provides close up details of various installations.

The '''Zahiri Revolt''' was a conspiracy leading to a failed coup d'état against the government of the 14th-century [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]], having been characterized as both a political struggle and a theological conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Chibli Mallat, ''Introduction to Middle Eastern law'', pg. 116. [[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2007. {{ISBN|9780199230495}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheikh Si Hamza Boubakeur, ''Traite moderne de Theologie Islamique'', pgs. 383–384. Paris: Maisonneve &amp; Larose, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; While the initial support for the potential overthrow of the sultan began in [[Egypt]], movement of Egyptian ideological agitators to [[Syria]] eventually caused the actual planned uprising to take place in [[Damascus]] in 1386.&lt;ref name=gold179&gt;[[Ignác Goldziher]], ''The Zahiris: Their Doctrine and Their History'', pg. 179. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997. {{ISBN|9789004026322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nas13&gt;Nasser Rabbat, "Who was al-Maqrizi?" pg. 13. Taken from Mamlūk Studies Review, Vol. 7, Part 2. Middle East Documentation Center, University of Chicago, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Rallying around Ahmad al-Zahiri, a cleric of the [[Zahiri]]te school of [[Sunni Islam]], the agitators mobilized from [[Hama]] to the capital. Having failed to secure the support of both the Mamluks and local Arab tribes, they were arrested by the authorities of [[Barquq]] before armed conflict could even take place.&lt;ref&gt;Ṭāhā Thaljī Ṭarāwinah, "The Province of Damascus During the Second Mamlūk Period (784/1382-922/1516)," pg. 109. ''Publications of the Deanship of Research and Graduate Studies, Muʼtah University'', vol. 25. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not all those taking part in the revolt accepted the views of the Zahiri school of law, the term was used to denote all of those willing to participate in armed conflict against the Mamluk sultan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kees Versteegh]], "[[Ibn Mada]] as a Zahiri Grammarian," pg. 213. Taken from ''Ibn Hazm of Cordoba: The Life and Works of a Controversial Thinker''. Eds. [[Camilla Adang]], [[Maribel Fierro]] and [[Sabine Schmidtke]]. [[Leiden]]: [[Brill Publishers]], 2012. {{ISBN|9789004234246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suppression of the revolt both practically and ideologically has been described as a sign of the Mamluk authorities' intolerance for non-conformist ideas and willingness to interfere in religious issues normally considered the domain of theologians in Muslim empires.&lt;ref&gt;Lutz Wiederhold, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=6253386CFF4218C0CAA203A94E720B81.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3044336 Legal-religious elite, temporal authority, and the caliphate in Mamluk society: conclusions drawn from the examination of a "Zahiri revolt" in Damascus in 1386]. [[International Journal of Middle East Studies]], vol. 31, pg. 225. [[Middle East Studies Association of North America]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Chamberlain, ''Knowledge and Social Practice in Medieval Damascus, 1190–1350''., pg. 167–174. [[Cambridge]]: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In December 1382, Muslim jurist [[Ibn Abi al-Izz]] of the [[Hanafi]]te school came under investigation for his theological criticism of a poem which would eventually be discredited, though not before the jurist's short inquisition.&lt;ref name=qadi89&gt;Ibn Qadi Shuhbah, ''al-I'lam bi Tarikh al-Islam'', pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 December that year, an affidavit was signed by the Sultan [[Barquq]] condemning the jurist as well as calling for an investigation of rumors regarding other jurists promoting the [[Zahiri]]te school of Sunni Muslim law in Damascus.&lt;ref name=qadi89/&gt; The four jurists rumored to be promoting non-conformist views were simply nicknamed al-Qurashi, Ibn al-Jabi, Ibn al-Husbani and Sadr ad-Din al-Yasufi.

Four years later, a Syrian [[Hanbali]]te known as Khalid of [[Homs]], who was actually from [[Aleppo]], moved to Damascus under the tutelage of the [[Sufi]] ascetic Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isma'il ibn Abd al-Rahim Shihab ad-Din Abu Hashim al-Zahiri, also known as al-Burhan. During this time, a number of Egyptians who had been influenced by Zahirite theology emigrated to Syria.&lt;ref name=gold179/&gt;&lt;ref name=nas13/&gt; Burhan engaged in study of [[Ibn Hazm]]'s book [[Al-Muhalla]] alongside Yasufi, with Ibn al-Jabi and Ibn al-Husbani following the other two.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Brockelmann, ''Geschichte der Arabschen Litteratur. Zweite den Supplementbanden ange-passte Auflage''. Vol. 1, pg. 400. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1937–1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Qurashi, on the other hand, associated with the above four only for the purpose of studying, but disliked Burhan personally.

==Discovery==
In August 1386, Khalid of Homs visited a local bedouin chief imprisoned in the [[Citadel of Damascus]] to seek support for the overthrow of the sultan and the installation of a [[caliphate]], Barquq himself having overthrown the caliph al-Mutawakkil Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr in order to come to power. The chief suggested that Khalid speak with Ibn al-Himsi, the Citadel's top official with no relation to Khalid despite the similar-sounding name, as he would likely support the overthrow.&lt;ref name="Shuhbah, pg. 304"&gt;Shuhbah, pg. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khalid informed the Citadel's commanding officer of the plot, claiming not only to have the backing of local bedouin tribes and urban Damascenes but also to have located a suitable candidate for a new caliph. The officer gave the impression that he supported the plot and asked to meet this new caliph, upon which Khalid revealed him to be Burhan and even gave the officer the exact address of Burhan's house.&lt;ref name="Shuhbah, pg. 304"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]], ''al-Durar al-Kamina'', vol. 1, pg. 514.&lt;/ref&gt; The officer sent a request for Burhan's presence; upon his arrival, both he and Khalid were immediately arrested.

==Aftermath==
In the absence of both the Citadel and Syria's governor Baydamur on leave, Ibn al-Himsi took up the acting role of governor. He wrote to Barquq in Cairo, adding in details of his own to the story.&lt;ref name=sh186&gt;Shuhbah, pgs. 186-176.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn al-Himsi not only informed the sultan of the capture of two ringleaders but also accused the governor of being a co-conspirator, leading to the arrest of the governor, his son Muhammad Shah, his nephew Aladdin al-Khazindar and two deputies in Ramadan that same year, corresponding September 1386.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Maqrizi, ''Al Selouk Leme'refatt Dewall al-Melouk'', vol. 3, part 2, pg. 549.&lt;/ref&gt; In the weeks following the arrest of Burhan and Khalid, the focus shifted into a witch hunt for anyone connected to Baydamur, resulting in both political and financial sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Hajr, ''Ibna al-Ghumr'', vol. 2, pgs. 343–345.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Sakhawi]], ''Al-Daw' al-lami` li ahli al-Qarni al-Tasi'', vol. 7, pg. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stemming from Burhan's confession, Yasufi was arrested and Ibn al-Husbani went into hiding. A second Hanbalite jurist, Amin ad-Din Ibn al-Najib of [[Baalbek]], was also arrested as a co-conspirator; while he was not directly involved in the conspiracy, he had openly opposed the sultan in the past.&lt;ref name=sh186/&gt; In November 1386, Burhan and Khalid were transported to Cairo in order for sultan Barquq to meet them face to face. In their absence, a number of other local officials and clerics were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the conspiracy. Eventually, the prisoners filed a petition requesting to either be released or killed; they were instead shackled and given sentences of manual labor on public construction projects. This set off a chain reaction; local Damascenes, taking pity on the fallen politicians and clerics, began demonstrating at the construction sites in opposition to both the forced manual labor and the Burji administration in general.&lt;ref&gt;Shuhbah, pg. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The military, fearing a spread of the revolt among the lower classes, immediately canceled the labor sentences and returned the prisoners to the Citadel.&lt;ref&gt;Wiederhold, pg. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to the ruling dynasty increased when a local cleric, Yusuf al-Zuayfarini, began riding around the Citadel on a horse, claiming he would free Baydamur, popular with the common people of Damascus as both a religious cleric in his own right and for refusing to collect taxes levied by the Mamluks which had no origin in Islamic law.&lt;ref&gt;Wiederhold, pg. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Zuayfarini's arrest was ordered as well, though like Ibn al-Husbani, he was able to avoid the Burji law enforcement.&lt;ref name=shu227&gt;Shuhbah, pg. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 December 1386, Burhan, Khalid and Ibn al-Najib arrived in Cairo. Charges were filed of a conspiracy to overthrow the Burji government and install a caliphate with a leader of [[Quraysh tribe|Qurashi]] origins.&lt;ref name=maq555&gt;Maqrizi, vol. 3, part 2, pg. 555.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 January 1387, they were brought before the sultan personally for both interrogation and trial. Burhan was defiant, verbally accusing Barquq of misrule by appropriating taxes which had no textual basis in [[Islamic law]] and asserting his demand for a Qurashi leader. Uninterested in a polemical debate, Barquq simply ordered the prisoners to be tortured until they revealed the names of all their co-conspirators.&lt;ref name=maq555/&gt;

The fallen governor Baydamur's name was cleared, but not before he died alone in his cell at the Citadel in February 1387.&lt;ref name=shu227/&gt; In March 1389, Burhan and Khalid were released in Cairo having only served two years and seven months, due to the intercession of an influential Shafi'ite jurist; Ibn al-Najib, who had been sent back to Damascus, was released along with the other Zahirites in the Citadel a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;Shuhbah, pgs. 268–269.&lt;/ref&gt; The only exception aside from Baydamur was Yasufi, who died in the Citadel in August 1387, more than a year before his comrades would be paroled.&lt;ref&gt;Shuhba, pgs. 228–229.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
While the revolt gained early momentum from Zahirite ideas, it is today viewed more in terms of the political agitation against the Mamluks and general displeasure with the marginalization of the caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;Wiederhold, pg. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Al-Maqrizi]], normally removed from the topics of his writings, not only reported the revolt but sought to justify it theologically, likely due to his own status as a Zahirite.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbat, pg. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Maqrizi was also a direct student of Burhan in theology.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Maqrizi, ''Tajrid al-Tawhid al-Mufid'', pg. 33 of the introduction of Sabri bin Salamah Shahin. [[Riyadh]]: Dar al-Qubs, 2005. {{ISBN|978-9960-49-202-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
