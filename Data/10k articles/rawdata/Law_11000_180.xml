'''Airtel Zero''' was a platform launched on 6 April 2015 in India by [[Bharti Airtel]], a multinational telecommunications service company across [[South Asia]] and the largest cellular service provider in [[India]], with 192.22 million subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chhavi|title=Aircel Adds Highest Number of GSM Subscribers in August followed by Airtel; Vodafone Loses : COAI|url=http://telecomtalk.info/aircel-adds-highest-number-of-gsm-subscribers-in-august-followed-by-airtel-vodafone-loses-coai/108943/|website=Telecomtalk.info|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per reports, Airtel Zero was a platform through which Airtel would have offered users free access to certain [[mobile applications]] and services from companies who had signed up with Airtel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saxena|first1=Anupam|title=Airtel Zero: Another blow to Net Neutrality|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Airtel-Zero-Another-blow-to-net-neutrality/articleshow/46823419.cms|accessdate=24 April 2015|publisher=The Times of India|date=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The announcement to launch Airtel Zero came soon after the [[Telecom Regulatory Authority of India]] (TRAI) released its consultation paper on [[Over-the-top content|OTT]] (Over-the-top) services and invited submissions on introducing OTT charges. Through the Zero platform, app developers and [[internet service providers]] (ISPs) would be able to make a part of their entire mobile app free for customers if they pay Airtel a fixed fee for the cost of data transfer incurred while using their services..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=ETbureau|title=Critics warn Airtel for flouting net neutrality; startups, others can offer apps for free on platform|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-04-07/news/60902957_1_net-neutrality-apps-bharti-airtel|accessdate=24 April 2015|publisher=The Economic Times|date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the launch, Airtel faced the lot of criticism on social media with users claiming it to be against [[net neutrality]]. Later TRAI supported net neutrality and ruled against differential data pricing based on content which resulted in ending [[zero-rating]] platforms in India including [[Facebook Free Basics]] and Airtel Zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/08/india-facebook-free-basics-net-neutrality-row|title=India deals blow to Facebook in people-powered 'net neutrality' row|last=Soni|first=Aayush|date=2016-02-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://qz.com/612129/the-lawyers-techies-and-comedians-who-fought-facebook-to-keep-indias-internet-free-and-open/|title=The lawyers, techies, and comedians who fought Facebook to keep India’s internet free and open|last=Punit|first=Itika Sharma|work=Quartz|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/facebook-free-basics-ban-net-neutrality-all-you-need-to-know/|title=TRAI supports Net Neutrality, effectively bans Free Basics: All that happened in this debate|date=2015-12-29|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2097">The term '''''animus revertendi''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase that means "With intention to return". &lt;ref&gt;Barron's Law Dictionary 5th Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can refer to an animal that is under the care of another, which distinguishes it from an animal ''ferae naturae'' (wild beast). It is a type of ownership right recognized by [[property law]]. This legal concept also supports the intent of a candidate not to abandon one's residence due to work or study. The legal residence is protected by this legal concept, as in the case of former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel's candidacy for Mayor of Chicago.

==Purpose==
The concept was originally created to protect the rights of livestock holders that had free ranging animals. Without the recognition of ''animus revertendi'', any animal that strayed away from the owner's property onto public land could be killed and taken without any compensation to the original caretaker. It takes a lot of time and effort to raise and feed a beast. By recognizing that the caretaker has rights, it promotes the care and feeding of animals, especially for human consumption, creates incentive to produce by eliminating the [[free rider problem]]. It may also be applied to pets.

==Requirements==
Fair notice of ''animus revertendi'' must be given, otherwise the right will not be recognized. The honest mistake of another in the absence of any fair notice will allow another party to claim the animal as his own.

==Types of notice==
In the absence of prior knowledge of ownership, one or more of these (or other) factors by itself or in combination with another could be used to determine if a reasonable person would have believed ''animus revertendi'' existed.

An '''anti-copyright notice''' is a specific statement that is added to a work in order to encourage wide distribution. Such notices are legally required to host such specific media; under the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] in [[International copyright agreements|international copyright law]], works are protected even if no [[copyright]] statement is attached to them. However, "[[anti-copyright]]" statements typically do not take the form of either sophisticated [[public copyright licenses]] or a simple dedication to the [[public domain]]; instead, they usually just encourage wide distribution.  Depending on jurisdiction, it is possible to denounce all claims to copyright in a work including [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] in a written disclaimer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

An example of an anti-copyright notice is the following: "Anti-Copyright! Reprint freely, in ''any'' manner desired, even without naming the source." Where such notices are attached depends highly on the type of work. They are often found in [[libertarian socialism|socialist anarchist]] magazines and books.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

A copyright [[waiver]] might{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} state the following:

{{quote|The author of this work hereby waives all claim of copyright (economic and moral) in this work and '''immediately''' places it in the public domain; it may be used, distorted or destroyed in any manner whatsoever without further attribution or notice to the creator.}}

The [[Creative Commons]] [[Creative Commons license#Zero / public domain|CC0]] was created for [[License compatibility|compatibility]] with also law domains (e.g. [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] of [[continental Europe]]) which have problems with the concept of ''dedicating into public domain'', as waiver statement with a fallback all-[[permissive license]].&lt;ref&gt;https://creativecommons.org/weblog/2009/03/11/13304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CC0"&gt;[https://rd-alliance.org/sites/default/files/cc0-analysis-kreuzer.pdf Validity of the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication and its usability for bibliographic metadata from the perspective of German Copyright Law] by Dr. Till Kreutzer, attorney-at-law in [[Berlin, Germany]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Unlicense]], published around 2010, has a focus on an [[anti-copyright]] message.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ostatic.com/blog/the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license The unlicense a license for no license] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324154539/http://ostatic.com/blog/the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license |date=2016-03-24 }} on ostatic.com by Joe Brockmeier (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Woody Guthrie]] used an anti-copyright notice on his songs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of Copyright # 154085, for a period of 28 years, and anybody caught singin it without our permission, will be mighty good friends of ourn, cause we don’t give a dern. Publish it. Write it. Sing it. Swing to it. Yodel it. We wrote it, that’s all we wanted to do.&lt;ref&gt;[https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4101], quoting from "Woody Guthrie: A Life."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite this, a number of organisations claim copyright of Guthrie's songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodyguthrie.org/Lyrics/Publisher_Contact.htm |title=Woody Guthrie Songs Publisher Contact |publisher=Woodyguthrie.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} would regard "anti-copyright" notices as being equivalent to a dedication of material into the [[public domain]] (as in the second example above).  Some of these disclaimers, however, are less accurate and need to be interpreted individually as the term anti-copyright has no accepted legal meaning.  For example, if just free distribution is encouraged, modification or lack of attribution is still illegal, making the material ineligible for collaborative writing projects like [[English Wikipedia]].  In such a case anti-copyright is not a true denial of copyright, but just a modification of the protection it affords copyright holders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1702">'''Antichresis''', under [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] and [[Roman law]], is a [[contract]] whereby a [[debtor]] [[pledge (law)|pledge]]s (i.e., conveys [[Possession (law)|possession]] but not [[Title (property)|title]]) [[real property]] to a [[creditor]], allowing the use and occupation of the pledged property, in lieu of [[interest]] on the [[loan]].

Historically, antichresis was used in Ancient [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]]) and by the [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]] and the [[ancient Rome|Romans]]. After the Western Church banned interest loans, it became a favored method of securing loans in early medieval society and was known in [[England]] as the [[mortgage law|gage of land]] ([[Old French|OFr]] ''gage'', [[Middle Low_German|MLG]] ''sate'', [[German language|Germ]] ''Satzung''). There were two variants: (1) the living gage (OFr ''vif gage'', MLG ''dotsate'', Germ ''Totsatzung''), under which the income and profits coming from the estate went towards reducing the loan's principal; and (2) the dead gage (OFr ''mort gage'', Germ ''Zinssatzung''), under which the income and profits were taken only as interest. The latter form underlies the modern antichresis.

If the creditor is a debtor, he can sell the rights of antichresis to another creditor ([[Latin|Lat]] ''subpignus'', Germ ''Unterpfand'', [[Italian language|It]] ''suppegno'').

'''California S.B. 1386''' was a bill passed by the [[California legislature]] that amended civil codes 1798.29, 1798.82 and 1798.84, the [[California law]] regulating the [[privacy]] of [[personal information]]. The first of many U.S. and international [[security breach notification laws]], it was introduced by California State Senator Peace on February 12, 2002, and became operative July 1, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Text  - SB-1386 Personal information:  privacy.|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=200120020SB1386|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abstract ==
Enactment of a requirement for notification to any resident of California whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.

Essentially, it requires an agency, person or business that conducts business in California and owns or licenses computerized 'personal information' to disclose any breach of security (to any resident whose unencrypted data is believed to have been disclosed).

The bill mandates various mechanisms and procedures with respect to many aspects of this scenario, subject also to other defined provisions.

The statute requires notification if you meet the following:
# Any agency that owns or licenses computerized data that includes personal information
# shall disclose any breach of the security of the system following discovery or notification of the breach in the security of the data
# to any resident of California whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.

An out-of-state corporation that has personal information relating to a California resident would fall under this statute. A question on [[minimum contacts]] would then ensue as to whether an action may be brought in California to enforce the California resident's rights under the statute.

Corporations with no physical locations in California are not subject to California law. SB 1386 no more impacts a Delaware corporation with no presence in California than do California laws regarding vehicle emissions. That SB 1386 would affect an out-of-state corporation is based on the notion of 'quasi in rem' jurisdiction, a notion that the Supreme Court invalidated in ''[[Shaffer v. Heitner]]''.

Corporations can determine whether they are subject to this statute by reviewing the following questions:

# Does their data include "personal information" as defined by the statute?
# Does that "personal information" relate to a California resident?
# Was the "personal information" unencrypted?
# Was there a "breach of the security" of the data as defined by the statute?
# Was the "personal information" acquired, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an unauthorized person?

A corporation that answers yes to all five of these questions must report.

The statute does not apply to "encrypted" information.  Thus one way to avoid reporting is to encrypt all "personal information."  A corporation can also avoid reporting if its data does not contain "personal information" relating to a California resident.

"Personal information" means an individual's first name or first initial and last name in combination
with any one or more of the following data elements, when either the name or the data elements are not encrypted:
# Social security number.
# Driver's license number or California Identification Card number.
# Account number, credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual's financial account.

"Personal information" does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records.

The case of '''Castañeda v. Pickard''' was [[Trial (law)|tried]] in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas]] in 1978. This case was filed against the [[Raymondville Independent School District]] (RISD) in Texas by Roy Castañeda, the father of two [[Mexican-American]] children. Mr. Castañeda claimed that the RISD was discriminating against his children because of their ethnicity. He argued that the classroom his children were being taught in was segregated, using a grouping system for classrooms based on criteria that were both ethnically and racially discriminating.

Mr. Castañeda also claimed the Raymondville Independent School District failed to establish sufficient [[bilingual education]] programs, which would have aided his children in overcoming the language barriers that prevented them from participating equally in the classroom.

According to ''[[Lau v. Nichols]]'', 414 U.S. 563 (1974),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Lau v. Nichols |vol=414 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=563 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1974 |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/414/563/case.html |accessdate=2017-09-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a case decided by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], school districts in this country are required to take the necessary actions in order to provide students who do not speak English as their first language the ability to overcome the educational barriers associated with not being able to properly comprehend what is being taught to them.  Castañeda argued that there was no way to sufficiently measure the Raymondville Independent School District's approach to overcoming this barrier.

The ''Castañeda v. Pickard'' case was tried, and on August 17, 1978, the court system ultimately ruled in favor of the Raymondville Independent School District, stating they had not violated any of the Castañeda children's constitutional or statutory rights.  As a result of the District Court ruling, Castañeda filed for an appeal, arguing that the District Court made a mistake in its ruling.

In 1981 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] ruled in favor of the Castañedas, and as a result, the court decision established a three-part assessment for determining how bilingual education programs would be held responsible for meeting the requirements of the [[Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Castañeda v. Pickard |vol=648 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=989 |pinpoint= |court=5th Cir. |date=1981 |url=https://openjurist.org/648/f2d/989 |accessdate=2017-09-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria are listed below:

*The bilingual education program must be “based on sound educational theory.”
*The program must be “implemented effectively with resources for personnel, instructional materials, and space.”
*After a trial period, the program must be proven effective in overcoming language barriers/handicaps.

In [[common law]] countries, a '''civil infraction''' is a non-criminal violation of a rule, [[Local ordinance|ordinance]], or regulation.&lt;ref name=MP/&gt;

==United States law==
A civil infraction is a violation of the law less serious than a [[misdemeanor]],&lt;ref name=MJI/&gt; and which usually does not attach certain individual rights such as a jury trial.

Unless the civil infraction is a violation of the sex offender registry. The sex offender registry has been judged constitutional due to being a civil measure instead of a criminal punishment. It appears to be the only civil infraction that is a felony and carries an extended prison sentence, however, leading some to doubt whether even lawmakers realize it isn't supposed to be punitive.

==Punishments for infractions==
In the United States, the key characteristic of an infraction is that the punishment seldom includes any amount of [[incarceration]] in a [[prison]] or [[County jail|jail]] or any other loss of civil rights{{spaced ndash}}typically the only punishment is a fine, although sometimes other regulatory actions are possible (e.g. revocation of a license or permit) or an order to [[Judicial remedy|remedy]] or mitigate the situation.

'''Clifford's Inn''' is a former [[Inn of Chancery]] in London. It was located between [[Fetter Lane]], Clifford's Inn Passage, leading off [[Fleet Street]] and [[Chancery Lane]] in the [[City of London]]. The Inn was founded in 1344 and refounded 15 June 1668. It was dissolved in 1903, and most of its original structure was demolished in 1934. It was both the first Inn of Chancery to be founded and the last to be demolished.

Through the ages, Clifford's Inn was engaged in educating [[student]]s in [[jurisprudence]], [[Edward Coke]] and [[John Selden]] being two of its best known alumni. It also accommodated graduates preparing for [[ordination]], such as the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/samuel-butler-and-art www.joh.cam.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; and those studying for other professions. In 1903, the members of Clifford's Inn reached the view that the establishment had outlived its purpose in education, and unanimously voted to dissolve its [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]]. Its remaining funds were donated to the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]].

Since then, Clifford's Inn has housed offices, such as [[Judiciary of England and Wales|The Senior Courts Costs Office]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/rcj-rolls-building/chancery-division/chancery-judges-listing-office www.justice.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; In apartments above, [[Virginia Woolf]], [[John Stuttard|Sir John Stuttard]] (679th [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]]) and [[Ernest Ryder|Sir Ernest Ryder (High Court Judge)]] have been residents.

==History==
[[File:ONL (1887) 1.090 - Clifford's Inn.jpg|thumb|1873 illustration]]
The [[Inns of Chancery]] appear to have evolved in tandem with the [[Inns of Court]]. During the 12th and 13th centuries the [[Law]] was taught in the [[City of London]] primarily by the [[clergy]].

However, during the 13th century two events happened which diminished this form of legal education: firstly, a decree by [[Henry III of England]] stating that no [[institute]]s of [[legal education]] could exist in the [[City of London]]; and, secondly, a [[Papal Bull]] prohibiting clergy from teaching law in London.&lt;ref name=watt5/&gt;

Consequently, the system of legal education dispersed, with lawyers instead settling on the outskirts of the City of London but as close as possible to [[Westminster Hall]], where the signing of the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' led to the establishment of a permanent [[court]].

The neighbourhood of what had been the small [[village]] of [[Holborn]] evolved into [[Dwelling|habitation]]s, ''i.e.'' "hostels" or "inns", which over time became known by the name of their respective landlords.&lt;ref name=watt5&gt;Watt (1928) P.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Inns of Chancery developed around the Inns of Court, establishing their name and ultimate purpose from the [[court of equity|Chancery]] [[Clerk]]s, who used these buildings not only as accommodation, but as offices from where to draft their [[writ]]s.&lt;ref name=steel586&gt;Steel (1907) p.586&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Middle Ages, education at one of these [[Inn of Chancery|Inn]]s has been considered the customary step to becoming a [[barrister]]. Therefore, a [[student]] or [[pupil]] entered one of the Inns of Chancery, where he would be taught in the latest form of [[moot court|moots]] and [[rote learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1928) P.9&lt;/ref&gt;

The land on which Clifford's Inn remains situated was granted to [[Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford|Lord de Clifford]] on 24 February 1310, and it is from his family that the Inn derives its name. Upon Lord de Clifford's death in 1314 his estates passed via his brother, [[Roger de Clifford, 2nd Baron de Clifford|Roger]], to his nephew, [[Robert de Clifford, 3rd Baron de Clifford]] after whose death in 1344, his widow (Isabel, [[Dowager|Lady]] [[Clifford family|de Clifford]]) granted use of the land to students of the law for £10 annually. It was the first recorded Inn of Chancery,&lt;ref name="inns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innertemple.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=36%3Ainns-court&amp;catid=22%3Ahistorical-articles&amp;Itemid=30&amp;limitstart=1|title=The Inns Of Court And Inns Of Chancery And Their Records|publisher=[[Inner Temple]]|accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its official date of incorporation is not known.

The Society of Clifford's Inn concluded purchase of the freehold of the property on 29 March 1618 from its then owner, [[Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland]], for the sum of £600, with the [[wikt:proviso#Noun|proviso]] that it should pay him £4 per year rent thereafter for use of the land and to keep a [[chambers (law)|set of chambers]] available for those [[barrister]]s of his choosing.&lt;ref&gt;Norman (1903) p.243&lt;/ref&gt;

On the death of the [[Henry Clifford, 5th Earl of Cumberland|5th Earl]], the earldom of Cumberland became extinct and the barony of Clifford (''[[:wikt:create|cr.]]'' by [[writ]] 1628) passed to his daughter and sole heiress, [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington|Lady Elizabeth Boyle]], [[Nicholas Tufton, 3rd Earl of Thanet|Countess of Thanet]]. After protracted family legal wranglings the rights and privileges to Clifford's Inn (together with the title of [[Hereditary]] [[High Sheriff of Westmorland|Sheriff of Westmorland]]) devolved upon his cousin, [[Lady Anne Clifford]] (''[[de jure]]'' [[Baron de Clifford|Baroness de Clifford]]), which estates remained with her descendants until the early 19th century.&lt;ref name=norm1&gt;Norman (1903) p.244&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clifford's Inn Doorway.jpg|thumb|Clifford's Inn Passage, London EC4]]
By 1903 it was apparent that the Inn was superfluous to requirements of legal education, so its members unanimously agreed to dissolve the society, selling the buildings and giving its residue to the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]], the nominal head of the [[barrister|Bar]], to do with it as it so wished.&lt;ref&gt;Norman (1903) p.248&lt;/ref&gt; The auction of the assets took place on 14 May of that year (''i.e.'' 1903), and the Inn was sold "at a ridiculously low price", in the sum of £100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Griggs (1903) p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings of the Inn were later demolished in 1934, save its gatehouse (at Clifford's Inn Passage), which survives to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carboncredentials.com/contact/ www.carboncredentials.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This [[gatehouse]] is believed to have been designed by [[Decimus Burton]], a student of the Inn 1830-34.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Bradley and Nikolaus Pevsner, ''London 1: The City of London'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2002, p. 293-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and structure==
Clifford's Inn was ruled by its Council, which was led by a Principal. As well as the Principal, the Council consisted of twelve [[barrister]]s, all elected by the Inn members and who enjoyed certain rights; they could hold chambers whenever they wanted and sat at a separate upper table to dine. The Principal was elected by the entire Inn's membership and was tasked with overseeing its day-to-day running and supervision of the Inn's servants; his privileges included the right to choose from any one of 18 sets of chambers and a generous allowance for beer.&lt;ref name=norm1/&gt; Principals were originally elected [[Ad vitam aut culpam|for life]], but subsequent to a council order dated 15 June 1668 they were subject to re-election every three years.&lt;ref name=norm1/&gt; However, between 1668 and the last election in 1890, only 21 men served as Principal of Clifford's Inn, since "once elected, always elected" unless infirm became customary practice.&lt;ref&gt;Norman (1903) p.245&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clifford family's protracted title dispute caused confusion in Clifford's Inn governance for some time, and during this period usage of a differenced [[coat of arms]] is recorded: "''Chequée Or and Azure, a Fess Gules, a Bordure bezantée of the Third''".&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt; Clifford's Inn later resumed its (or adopted) usage of the ancient Clifford arms, namely: "''Chequée Or and Azure, a Fess Gules''".

Noted students in the law at Clifford's Inn include [[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]] and [[John Selden]].&lt;ref&gt;Woolrych (1826) p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman (1903) p.239&lt;/ref&gt; Although generally considered to be an adjunct to the [[Inner Temple]], the members of Clifford's Inn always maintained that they were a separate entity.&lt;ref name=palmer&gt;Loftie (1895) p.262&lt;/ref&gt; As a mark of that "independence" the Inner Temple [[bencher]]s began a tradition of sending Clifford's Inn a message once a year, to which of course a reply was neither likely nor expected!&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt;

In [[law]], a '''colloquy''' is a routine, highly formalized [[conversation]]. Conversations among the [[judge]] and [[lawyer]]s (as opposed to [[testimony]] under [[oath]]) are colloquys. The term may be applied to the conversation that takes place when a defendant enters into a [[plea bargain]] and the judge is supposed to verify that the defendant understands that he is waiving his right to a [[jury trial]].

In [[criminal justice|criminal court]], '''a colloquy''' is an investigation within a [[defendant]]'s plea to reassure that the plea was given ''knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently''. Defendant needs to understand the charges against him, the penalties that he will face, and his rights before entering into a guilty plea.  In the United States, that includes describing the rights guaranteed by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]]s as well as a caution that non-citizens who are convicted of crimes risk expulsion from the country.

A Defendant who denies guilt may still "plead down" (lesser offense than accusation) but:
1) Provided Court allows it.
2) Provided accused intelligently concludes on an open record that a plea is in her/his best interest. (e.g. avoiding incarceration, a more serious charge/convicton).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15869">{{Criminal defenses}}In the field of [[criminal law]], there are a variety of conditions that will tend to negate elements of a crime (particularly the ''intent'' element), known as '''defenses'''. The label may be apt in jurisdictions where the ''accused'' may be assigned some ''burden'' before a [[tribunal]]. However, in many jurisdictions, the entire burden to prove a crime is on the ''government'', which also must prove the ''absence'' of these defenses, where implicated. In other words, in many jurisdictions the absence of these so-called defenses is treated as an element of the crime. So-called defenses may provide partial or total refuge from punishment.

==Types of defenses==

=== Mental Disorder (Insanity) ===
{{main|Mental Disorder (Insanity) Defense}}
[[File:The Rake's Progress 8.jpg|left|thumb|[[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', depicting the world's oldest [[psychiatric hospital]], [[Bethlem Hospital]]]]
Insanity or ''mental disorder'' (Australia and Canada), may negate the ''intent'' of any crime, although it pertains only to those crimes having an ''intent'' element. A variety of rules have been advanced to define what, precisely, constitutes criminal ''insanity''. The most common definitions involve either an actor's lack of understanding of the wrongfulness of the offending conduct, or the actor's inability to conform conduct to the law.&lt;ref&gt;''[[M'Naghten's case]]'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1843/J16.html (1843) 10 C &amp; F 200], where a man suffering extreme paranoia believed the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory party]] of the [[United Kingdom]], were persecuting him. He wanted to shoot and kill Prime Minister [[Sir Robert Peel]], but got Peel's secretary in the back instead. Mr M'Naghten was found to be insane, and instead of prison, put in a mental hospital. The case produced the [[M'Naghten rules|rules]] that a person is presumed to be sane and responsible, unless it is shown that (1) he was labouring under such a defect of reason (2) from disease of the mind (3) as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong. These elements must be proven present on the [[balance of probabilities]].  "Defect of reason" means much more than, for instance, absent mindedness making a lady walk from a supermarket without paying for a jar of mincemeat. ''R v. Clarke'' [1972] 1 All ER 219, caused by diabetes and depression, but the lady pleaded guilty because she did not want to defend herself as insane. Her conviction was later quashed. A "disease of the mind" includes not just brain diseases, but any impairment "permanent or transient and intermittent" so long as it is not externally caused (e.g. by drugs) and it has some effect on one's mind. ''R v. Sullivan'' [1984] AC 156.  So epilepsy can count, as can an artery problem causing temporary loss of consciousness (and a man to attack his wife with a hammer). ''R v. Kemp'' [1957] 1 QB 399. Diabetes may cause temporary "insanity"  ''R v. Hennessy'' [1989] 2 All ER 9; though see ''R v. Quick'' [1973] and the automatism defense. and even sleep walking has been deemed "insane".''R v. Burgess'' [1991] 2 All ER 769  "Not knowing the nature or wrongness of an act" is the final threshold which confirms insanity as related to the act in question. In ''R v. Windle''  ''R v. Windle'' 1952 2 QB 826 a man helped his wife commit suicide by giving her a hundred [[aspirin]]. He was in fact mentally ill, but as he recognised what he did and that it was wrong by saying to [[police]] "I suppose they will hang me for this", he was found not insane and guilty of murder.  Mr Windle was not hanged!&lt;/ref&gt;  If one succeeds in being declared "not guilty by reason of insanity," then the result frequently is treatment in a [[mental hospital]], although some jurisdictions provide the sentencing authority with flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in the U.K. [[Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991]], giving the judge discretion to impose hospitalisation, guardianship, supervision and treatment or discharge.&lt;/ref&gt;  As further described in articles available online.

===Automatism===
{{main|Automatism (law)}}
Automatism is a state where the [[muscle]]s act without any control by the mind, or with a lack of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;''Bratty v. Attorney-General for Northern Ireland'' [1963] AC 386&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Falconer'' [1990] HCA 49; (1990) 171 CLR 30 (22 November 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; One may suddenly fall ill, into a dream like state as a result of post traumatic stress,&lt;ref&gt;''R v. T'' [1990] Crim LR 256&lt;/ref&gt; or even be "attacked by a swarm of bees" and go into an automatic spell.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Kay v. Butterworth'' (1945) 61 TLR 452&lt;/ref&gt; However, to be classed as an "automaton" means there must have been a total destruction of voluntary control, which does not include a partial loss of consciousness as the result of driving for too long.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General's Reference (No. 2 of 1992)'' [1993] 4 All ER 683&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the onset of loss of bodily control was blameworthy, e.g., the result of voluntary drug use, it may be a defense only to specific intent crimes.&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Hardie'' [1984] 1 WLR 64. Mr Hardie took his girlfriend's [[valium]], because she had just [[Relationship breakup|kicked him out]] and he was [[Depression (mood)|depressed]]. She encouraged him to take them, to make him feel better. But he got angry and set fire to the [[wardrobe]]. It was held that he should not be convicted of [[arson]] because he expected the valium to calm him down, and this was its normal effect.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intoxication===
{{main|Intoxication defense}}
[[File:Michelangelo drunken Noah.jpg|right|thumb|''The Drunkenness of Noah'' by [[Michelangelo Buonarroti|Michelangelo]]]]
In some jurisdictions, intoxication may negate [[specific intent]], a particular kind of ''[[mens rea]]'' applicable only to some crimes. For example, lack of specific intent might reduce murder to manslaughter. ''Voluntary'' intoxication nevertheless often will provide basic intent, e.g., the intent required for manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;[[DPP v. Majewski]] 1977 AC 433, where M was drunk and drugged and attacked people in a pub. He had no defense to [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]].  In ''R v. Sheehan and Moore'' two viciously drunken scoundrels threw [[petrol]] on a [[tramp]] and set [[fire]] to him. They got off for murder, but still went down for [[manslaughter]], since that is a crime of basic intent. Of course, it can well be the case that someone is not drunk enough to support any intoxication defense at all.  ''R v. Gallagher'' [1963] AC 349.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, ''involuntarily'' intoxication, for example by punch spiked unforeseeably with alcohol, may give rise to no inference of basic intent.

Strictly speaking, however, it could be argued that intoxication is not a defense, but a denial of ''mens rea'';&lt;ref&gt;[2009] Crim L.R. 3&lt;/ref&gt; the main difference being that a defense accepts the ''mens rea'' and ''[[actus reus]]'' of an offence are present. With intoxication, there is no acceptance of the ''mens rea'' of the offence. For offences of basic intent, the act itself is criminalised. All that is needed is the intent to do the act. It can therefore be inferred that there is such intent relatively easily; when intoxicated one is not an automaton - there is still control of one's actions. Therefore, intoxication will rarely (if ever) deny the ''mens rea'' of crimes of basic intent. With specific intent, the character of the act is criminalised, for the act itself is often objectively innocent. Appropriation of an item is perfectly innocent, yet when one appropriates with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it, there is a theft. This is much more difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt, for an intoxicated person may exercise control over his actions but will often lack an understanding of what is being done - without this understanding the necessary intent cannot be proven. Therefore, whilst it is tempting to think of intoxication as a defense, it is more accurate to see it as a denial of the ''mens rea'' of an offence - where the ''mens rea'' or ''actus reus'' is not proven, there is no need for defenses.

===Mistake Of Fact===
{{main|Mistake (criminal law)}}
"I made a mistake" is a defense in some jurisdictions if the mistake is about a fact and is genuine.&lt;ref&gt;''DPP v. Morgan and others'' [1976] AC 182, where an [[RAF]] man told three officers to have sex with his wife and she would pretend to refuse just to be stimulating. They pleaded mistake, and the jury did not believe them.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense is most often used in conjunction with another defense, where the mistake led the defendant to believe that their actions were justifiable under the second defense. For example, a charge of assault on a police officer may be negated by genuine (and perhaps reasonable) mistake of fact that the person the defendant assaulted was a criminal and not an officer, thus allowing a defense of use of force to prevent a violent crime (generally part of self-defense/defense of person).&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Williams'' [1987] 3 All ER 411&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necessity/Lesser harm===
{{main|Necessity (criminal law)}}
An overarching theory of criminal defenses is the doctrine of necessity. Generally speaking, a criminal act can be justifiable if it is necessary to prevent a foreseeable and greater harm than the harm created by the act. For instance, trespassing is generally justified if the defendant only trespassed in order to, for instance, instantaneously attempt to put out a fire on the property, or to rescue someone drowning in a pool on the property. The destruction or death caused by following the law and not trespassing would have been far greater than the harm caused by trespassing. Similarly, most laws forbidding the discharge of [[firearm]]s in public contain an exception for emergency or defensive use. Necessity generally forms the basis for many other defenses and their favor, such as capacity of office, legal duty, and self-defense.

===Lawful Capacity of Office===
This defense is generally available to public servants and first responders, such as police officers, firefighters, EMTs, etc. It usually protects the first responder from responsibility for otherwise criminal actions that the first responder must perform as an appointed agent of the jurisdiction in the course and scope of their duties. For example, a paramedic who forcibly enters a house or building in answer to an emergency call cannot be charged with breaking and entering. A judge who sentences a man to die for a crime cannot be charged with attempted murder if the convicted man is later exonerated. Such protection is generally limited to acts required in the course and scope of employment, and it does not preclude gross negligence or malicious intent.

====Legal Duty====
This "lawful capacity of office" defense can also apply to civilians who do not hold such a position, but whose assistance is requested by someone who does, such as a police officer. A person who witnesses a criminal being chased by police who yell "stop that man!", and obliges resulting in injury to the criminal, cannot be charged with assault or sued for personal injury. "Good Samaritan" laws generally provide [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity]] in civil and criminal proceedings to persons who, in good faith, cause injury while attempting to help a person in distress, protecting such persons even in cases where greater harm resulted from the action than would have occurred otherwise.

===Self defense===
{{main|Self-defense (theory)}}

Self-defense is, in general, some reasonable action taken in protection of self.  An act taken in self-defense often is not a crime at all; no punishment will be imposed. To qualify, any defensive force must be proportionate to the threat. Use of a firearm in response to a non-lethal threat is a typical example of disproportionate force; however, such decisions are dependent on the situation and the applicable law, and thus the example situation can in some circumstances be defensible, Generally because of a codified presumption intended to prevent the unjust negation of this defense by the trier of fact.

===Duress===
{{main|Duress}}
&lt;!--[[File:galahad.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sir Galahad]], a mediaeval [[hero]] displaying qualities that Lord Halisham thought everyone could display under duress]]--&gt;
One who is "under duress" is forced into an unlawful act. Duress can be a defense in many jurisdictions, although not for the most serious crimes of [[murder]],&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Anderson'', 8 Cal. 4th 767, 50 P.3d 368, 122 Cal. Rptr. 2d 587 (2002) (noting that according to Blackstone, duress was not an available defense to murder at common law and holding that is still current law in California).&lt;/ref&gt; [[attempted murder]], being an accessory to murder&lt;ref&gt;c.f. ''DPP for Northern Ireland v. Lynch'' [1975] 1 All ER 913, the old English rule whereby duress was available for a secondary party to murder; see now ''R v. Howe'' [1987] 1 AC 417, where the defendant helped [[torture]], [[Sexual abuse|sexually abuse]] and [[strangling]].&lt;/ref&gt; and in many countries, [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;This strict rule has been upheld in relation to a sixteen-year-old boy told by his father to stab his mother.  ''R v. Gotts'' [1992] 2 AC 412, convicted for attempted murder.&lt;/ref&gt; The duress must involve the threat of imminent peril of death or serious injury, operating on the defendant's mind and overbearing his will.&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Abdul-Hussain'' [1999] Crim LR 570, where two Shiites escaped from persecution in Iraq by going to Sudan and hijacking a plane. The threat was not imminent but "hanging over them" so they were not convicted.&lt;/ref&gt; Threats to third persons may qualify.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., family, ''R v. Martin'' [1989], close friends, or under certain circumstances, car passengers, ''R v. Conway'' [1988] 3 All ER 1025&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant must reasonably believe the threat,&lt;ref&gt;n.b. this may differ to the state of mind in the case of mistake, where the only requirement is that one honestly believes something. Here it may need to be a "reasonable belief", see also ''R v. Hasan (formerly Z)'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/22.html [2005&amp;#93; UKHL 22]&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no defense if "a sober person of reasonable firmness, sharing the characteristics of the accused" would have responded differently.&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Graham'' [1982], where duress was rejected&lt;/ref&gt; Age, pregnancy, physical disability, mental illness, sexuality have been considered, although basic intelligence has been rejected as a criterion.&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Bowen'' [1996]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The accused must not have foregone some safe avenue of escape.&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Gill'' [1963], where someone told to steal a lorry could have raised the alarm; see also ''R v. Hudson and Taylor'' [1971] where two teenage girls were scared into perjuring, and not convicted because their age was relevant and police protection not always seen to be safe.&lt;/ref&gt; The duress must have been an order to do something specific, so that one cannot be threatened with harm to repay money and then choose to rob a bank to repay it.&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Cole'' [1994]&lt;/ref&gt; If one puts themselves in a position where they could be threatened, duress may not be a viable defense.&lt;ref&gt;See ''R v. Sharp'' [1987].  But see ''R v. Shepherd'' [1987]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impossibility defense===

An [[impossibility defense]] is a criminal defense occasionally used when a defendant is accused of a criminal attempt that failed only because the crime was factually or legally impossible to commit.

'''Criminal jurisdiction''' is a term used in [[constitutional law]] and [[public law]] to describe the power of [[court]]s to hear a case brought by a [[State (polity)|state]] accusing a [[defendant]] of the commission of a [[crime]]. It is relevant in three distinct situations:
#to regulate the relationship between states, or between one state and another;
#where the [[nation]] is a [[federation]], to regulate the relationship between the federal courts and the domestic courts of those states comprising the federation; and
#where a state only has, to a greater or lesser extent, a single and unified system of law, it is the law of [[criminal procedure]] to regulate what cases each classification of court within the judicial system shall adjudicate upon. People must be tried in the same state the crime is committed.

==Extraterritorial issues==

===Supranational courts===
Under the [[public international law]] system, [[de jure]] states are [[sovereignty|sovereign]] within their own territorial boundaries. A few states such as the [[Netherlands]] have adopted a monist approach, i.e. they accept international and municipal laws as part of a single system. Thus, whether a [[supranationalism|supranational]] court or tribunal has criminal jurisdiction over its territory or [[citizen]]s, will be determined by international law. The majority of states are dualist, i.e. they will only accept international obligations through the process of incorporation, say by signing and adopting [[treaty|treaties]] and conventions. Hence, whether a supranational court or tribunal will have jurisdiction and, if so, over what subject matter and over what period of time, will be decided by the sovereign [[government]] of the day.

===Extraterritorial jurisdiction in international law===
Because each government is [[Parliamentary supremacy|supreme]], it can enact whatever [[statute]]s it wishes. Thus, State A would have the power to make a law which, for example, made it an offence to smoke in the streets of State B, a neighbouring state. State A could employ officers and equip them with cameras. These officers could then collect evidence in State B and, when its citizens returned home, State A could prosecute them for breach of the law. But State A's law could not be [[direct effect|directly effective]] in State B because that would make State B less than sovereign. Similarly, State A could not seek the [[extradition]] of its own citizens from State B unless State B was formally to consent (usually through the negotiation of a treaty including the particular offence).

===International crime===
Transborder crimes take place in more than one state. For example, a defendant may fire a gun, post a package, or write or speak words in State A, but the effects of each action are felt in State B. Some states claim a [[public policy (law)|public policy]] justification to exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed by, or crimes committed against their citizens, even though these crimes are committed outside their borders. Thus, one of the classifications of crime is "crimes against the state". These are crimes that affect the interests of the state or its administration. In extreme cases, a state may wish to prosecute one of its own citizens for [[treason]] even though all the relevant acts and omissions took place in another state. Similarly, if a citizen of State A is acting in a way that interferes with the friendly relations between State A and State B, it may be expedient to prosecute this citizen no matter where the relevant acts have been committed. Jurisdiction may also be claimed over crimes on board the [[ship]]s and [[aircraft]] operated by [[corporation]]s based in the given state, no matter where these craft may be located at the relevant time. In [[English law]], where [[murder]] and [[manslaughter]] are concerned, the English court has jurisdiction over offences committed abroad, if it was committed by a British citizen (see section 9 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] and section 3 of the [[British Nationality Act 1948]]). In ''R v Cheong'' (2006) AER (D) 385 the appellant was living in Guyana in 1983. He shot and killed a man who had just robbed his wife and sister-in-law. Under local law he was charged only with the unlicensed possession of a firearm; but as a British citizen, section 9 of the 1861 Act applied 19 years after he returned to England and he was charged with murder. On appeal, a conviction for manslaughter was upheld. At a level of conventional policy, there are two main theories to justify the exercise of jurisdiction:

====The initiatory or subjective theory====
The state in which the sequence of events begins, claims jurisdiction because the accused did everything in his or her power to commit the offence within its territory. Intending to deceive Y into parting with money, X writes a begging letter claiming to be a penniless widow with ten starving children and posts it in State A. X must then rely on the postal workers to carry the letter to Y in State B. No matter how hard X tries, X cannot take any further action to promote the scheme, and whether it succeeds or fails is entirely outside his or her ability to control. There are three theoretical issues to consider:
*the definition of the ''actus reus'' elements of the crime must be wide enough to include a continuing sequence of events. Some offences are either frozen in time or geography because they are defined either as activities being undertaken when the harm occurs (e.g. driving offences), or in terms of their consequences. For example, the definition of a "deception" is some form of dishonest representation that induces the victim to do or refrain from doing something that causes him or her loss. Anything else is preparatory or anticipatory to this key intellectual event. Thus, to facilitate a prosecution of X, the definition of the offence in State A must include writing and posting the letter in State A as well as the operation of the letter upon the mind of the recipient in the State B.
*State A would be prosecuting conduct occurring within its borders that does not constitute the complete ''actus reus'', i.e. unless and until the letter is read by the recipient, the deception cannot operate or fail. The alternative would be to consider X's actions of writing and posting the letter as preparatory acts and so an [[attempt]]. This would be sensible if the letter fails to convince Y, but a nonsense if the letter actually induces Y into sending a cheque back to X.
*the policy that caused State A to criminalise the given ''actus reus'' must justify a prosecution even though no actual injury or damage has been sustained to a person resident within the territory of State A. The usual justification for criminalising any set of acts or omissions is as a deterrent to protect local citizens. It is not usually the policy of State A to protect the citizens of State B from harm: that duty arises out of the [[social contract]] between State B and its own citizens.
In English law, see the definition of a [[Deception (criminal law)|deception]] which must be the operative cause of the "obtaining" in the deception offences and under the [[Theft Act 1978]], and note that all the [[inchoate offense|inchoate offences]]s move in time and across borders so that an attempt continues from the proximate act until failure, a [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] agreement is not limited to a particular place, and the encouragement by a secondary party as an [[accessory (legal term)|accessory]] continues until the principal commits the substantive offence.

====The terminatory or objective theory====
If the injury or damage affects a citizen within the territory of a state, it would be usual for that state to claim jurisdiction to protect the interests of those who are present within its borders. But X would not have taken any action within State B's borders, so the wording of the ''actus reus'' must permit a prosecution in this situation. The theoretical justification for this jurisdiction may be that X has intended to cause the loss or injury and so should not escape liability through the device of only seeking to deceive those resident outside State A (a strategy that would be very simple given the [[internet]]). The justification is less clear when the place of injury is an accident. Within a single state, the doctrine of [[transferred intent]] would apply to criminalise accidental departures from a planned attack, but if X's letter is redirected out of State A by one of Y's helpful relatives, the receipt of the letter by Y on holiday in State B is entirely outside X's actual intention (just it might be irrelevant to a sender where the recipient of an [[e-mail]] is resident). Alternatively, suppose that X physically attacks Y in State A, intending to kill him. Both are [[nationality|nationals]] of State A. Y is seriously injured and, because the hospitals in State B have a superior track record for treating injuries of this type, Y arranges to be transferred to State B where he later dies. Again, there is no causal connection between X's initial criminal acts and the territory of State B, and seeking to found jurisdiction simply on the ground that Y died within its borders, is not wholly convincing given that Y is not a national of State B and so neither owes [[allegiance]] nor is owed any duty of protection as a part of State B's social contract.

==In the United States==
The [[United States]] is a federation of [[U.S. states|states]]. The [[U.S. Constitution]] creates a federal government and legislature which has general powers over the territory of the whole and over foreign policy, whereas the individual states have their own governments that, within the scope allowed by the federal constitution, have local territorial jurisdiction. There is a system of [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] which have jurisdiction to hear charges alleging federal crimes, and state courts have jurisdiction to hear charges alleging violations of local state law.

===U.S. federal courts===

Under the U.S. Constitution, the power of Congress to enact criminal statutes is limited; the federal government lacks "plenary criminal jurisdiction."&lt;ref&gt;Note, "Piggyback Jurisdiction in the Proposed Federal Criminal Code," ''The Yale Law Journal'', Vol. 81, No. 6 (May 1972, pp. 1209-1242, at 1210.&lt;/ref&gt; The powers of Congress to enact criminal laws "are not boundless."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Doyle, "Congressional Authority to Enact Criminal Law: An Examination of Selected Recent Cases," p. 1, March 27, 2013, ''Congressional Research Service''.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Constitution mentions explicit authority for Congress in three areas: (1) counterfeiting, (2) piracy and felony on the high seas and offenses against the law of nations, and (3) treason.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Doyle, "Congressional Authority to Enact Criminal Law: An Examination of Selected Recent Cases," p. 1, March 27, 2013, ''Congressional Research Service''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the "necessary and proper" clause of the Constitution gives Congress "broad power to enact laws that are 'convenient or useful' or 'conductive' to the authority's 'beneficial exercise' ".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Doyle, "Congressional Authority to Enact Criminal Law: An Examination of Selected Recent Cases," p. 2, March 27, 2013, ''Congressional Research Service''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States district courts have original, exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over "all offenses against the laws of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|3231}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some crimes are related to areas owned by or under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government. Examples of these crimes include those committed in the [[District of Columbia]], in [[United States territory|U.S. Territories]], in [[U.S. National Parks]], in [[United States federal courts|federal courthouses]] and [[federal prison]]s, and aboard airplanes (regulated by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]) and ocean-going vessels. The United States military has its own criminal justice system applicable to its members, and civilians may be charged with a federal crime for acts committed on military bases. Federal courts also have jurisdiction to hear cases brought against U.S. citizens based on their illegal activities in other countries.

The [[Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] calls for trial “by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.” Within the federal court system, Rule 18 of the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]] specifies which federal court may hear a particular criminal case:

:''Unless a statute or these rules permit otherwise, the government must prosecute an offense in a district where the offense was committed. The court must set the place of trial within the district with due regard for the convenience of the defendant and the witnesses, and the prompt administration of justice.''

''Anderson'', 328 U.S., at 703 holds: “[T]he ''locus delicti'' must be determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.” In ''Hyde v. United States'', 225 U.S. 347 (1912) although none of the defendants had entered the District of Columbia as part of their conspiracy to defraud the United States, they were convicted because one co-conspirator had committed overt acts in Columbia (225 U.S., at 363). So conspiracy is a continuing offense committed in all the districts where a co-conspirator acts on the agreement. Similarly, ''In re Palliser'', 136 U.S. 257 (1890) the sending of letters from New York to postmasters in Connecticut in an attempt to gain postage on credit, made Connecticut, where the mail he addressed and dispatched was received, an appropriate venue (136 U.S., at 266—268). See 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a):
:Any offense involving the use of the mails … is a continuing offense and … may be … prosecuted in any district from, through, or into which such … mail matter … moves.
This was applied in ''United States v. Johnson'', 323 U.S. 273, 275 (1944) so that “an illegal use of the mails … may subject the user to prosecution in the district where he sent the goods, or in the district of their arrival, or in any intervening district.”

===Problems===
This system works well when there is a clear line of demarcation between the two state jurisdictions, or between a state and federal jurisdictions, and prosecutions may be initiated in the appropriate court. But laws and rules are not always so clear.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

====Concurrent jurisdiction====
Some crimes have national significance and, to reflect the public interest, their investigation and prosecution will fall to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] or the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. This creates tensions between the two systems because the individual states in which aspects of the criminal activity have taken place may wish to assert jurisdiction over that part, whereas the federal authorities will wish to consolidate the wrongdoing across several states into a single [[trial (law)|trial]].

One significant result of the [[concurrent jurisdiction]] between state and federal courts (and in some cases between different state courts) is that an individual who violates both state and federal law, or the laws of multiple states, can be separately charged and tried in each jurisdiction. Thus, a resident of [[Virginia]] who defrauds a [[Florida]] resident through the mail may be tried in Virginia state court and in a Florida state court, and in a federal court in either Florida ''or'' Virginia. A famous example of dual state and federal sovereignty is the [[Rodney King]] case. Police officers who beat motorist Rodney King were acquitted of assault charges in the [[California]] state court, but were convicted of violating King's civil rights - based on the same events - in a federal court in California.

'''''Daulia Ltd v Four Millbank Nominees Ltd''''' [1977] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1977/5.html EWCA Civ 5] is an [[English contract law]] case, concerning unilateral contracts, and when embarking on the performance of an act for which an offer is open, at what point the offer may be withdrawn. In particular, Goff LJ observed that there would be a duty to not prevent full performance of terms in a unilateral offer, once performance had begun.

==Facts==
Daulia Ltd wanted to buy the premises on [[Millbank]], London from Four Millbank Nominees Ltd, who were mortgagees in possession. Formal contracts were never exchanged, but Daulia argued they did obtain a [[unilateral contract]] by the first defendants that they would enter into a written contract of sale, if they attended Four Millbank's offices with a draft contract on terms already negotiated and a deposit. But when Daulia Ltd's representatives attended, Four Millbank refused to exchange. Daulia Ltd claimed breach of the oral agreement.

At first instance, Brightman J struck out Daulia Ltd's statement of claim for failing to comply with s.40(1) of the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] (now, the requirement of form for contracts for interests in land under s.2, [[Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989]]). Daulia Ltd appealed.

==Judgment==
The Court of Appeal dismissed Daulia Ltd's appeal. They held there was a unilateral contract for disposition of land, and therefore it could not be effective because it did not comply with s.40(1). Furthermore there was no act of part performance, which could lead to a binding contract. In the course of his decision Goff LJ said that had there been part performance, it would be a duty of the offeror to not prevent full performance (see also, ''[[Errington v Errington]]''). Goff LJ's judgment went as follows.

{{cquote|I therefore turn to the first question. Was there a concluded unilateral contract by the first defendants to enter into a contract for sale on the agreed terms? The concept of a unilateral or "if contract" is somewhat anomalous, because it is clear that, at all events until the offeree starts to perform the condition, there is no contract at all, but merely an offer which the offeror is free to revoke.

Doubts have been expressed whether the offeror becomes bound so soon as the offeree starts to perform or satisfy the condition, or only when he has fully done so.

In my judgment, however, we are not concerned in this case with any such problem, because in my view the plaintiffs had fully performed or satisfied the condition when they presented themselves at the time and place appointed with a banker's draft for the deposit, and their part of the written contract for sale duly engrossed and signed and there tendered the same, which I understand to mean proffered it for exchange. Actual exchange, which never took place, would not in my view have been part of the satisfaction of the condition but something additional which was inherently necessary to be done by the plaintiffs to enable, not to bind the first defendants to perform the unilateral contract.

Accordingly in my judgment, the answer to the first question must be in the affirmative.

Even if my reasoning so far be wrong the conclusion in my view is still the same for the following reasons. Whilst I think the true view of a unilateral contract must in general be that the offeror is entitled to require full performance of the condition which he has imposed and short of that he is not bound, that must be subject to one important qualification, which stems from the fact that there must be an implied obligation on the part of the offeror not to prevent the condition becoming satisfied, which obligation it seems to me must arise as soon as the offeree starts to perform. Until then the offeror can revoke the whole thing, but once the offeree has embarked on performance it is too late for the offeror to revoke his offer.

This brings me to the second question. There are certain English cases touching this matter, but none precisely in point.

The plaintiffs rely strongly on ''[[Warlow v. Harrison]]'' (1858) 1 E1. &amp; E1. 295 and ''[[Johnston v. Boyes]]'' [1899] 2 Ch. 73 . In the former an auctioneer knocked down as sold for 61 guineas, which was bid by the owner, a pony which according to the particulars was to be sold without reserve, and the auctioneer, not the vendor, was sued for damages by the plaintiff who was the highest independent bidder at 60 guineas. In the Court of Queen's Bench, see p. 308, Lord Campbell held that there was no contract because the vendor had revoked the auctioneer's authority to accept the plaintiff's bid, and therefore no question of the impact of section 17 of the Statute of Frauds arose.

The Exchequer Chamber agreed with this conclusion on the pleadings as they stood, but allowed an amendment, and held the defendant liable; per Martin B. as upon a contract that the sale should be without reserve, and per Willes J. and Bramwell B. upon a breach of warranty of authority to sell without reserve, and Martin B. said at pp. 316-317:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Upon the same principle, it seems to us that the highest bona fide bidder at an auction may sue the auctioneer as upon a contract that the sale shall be without reserve. We think the auctioneer who puts the property up for sale upon such a condition pledges himself that the sale shall be without reserve, or, in other words, contracts that it shall be so; and that this contract is made with the highest bona fide bidder; and, in case of breach of it, that he has a right of action against the auctioneer. The case is not at all affected by section 17 of the Statute of Frauds, which relates only to direct sales, and not to contracts relating to or connected with them."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This case affords support for the plaintiffs' contention as far as it goes, but it is distinguishable, since there the action was against the auctioneer, not the vendor, and it was not upon a contract by the auctioneer that he himself would sell to the highest bidder but that his principal would do so.

''[[Warlow v. Harrison]]'', 1 E1. &amp; E1. 295 was approved by Cozens-Hardy J. in ''[[Johnston v. Boyes]]'' [1899] 2 Ch. 73 , 77, where he related it to the vendor himself, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A vendor who offers property for sale by auction on the terms of printed conditions can be made liable to a member of the public who accepts the offer if those conditions be violated: see ''[[Warlow v. Harrison]]'', 1 E1. &amp; E1. 295 and the recent case of ''[[Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.]]'' [1893] 1 Q.B. 256. Nor do I think that the Statute of Frauds would afford any defence to such an action. The plaintiff is not suing on a contract to purchase land: she is suing simply because her agent, in breach of the first and second conditions of sale, was not allowed to sign a contract which would have resulted in her becoming the purchaser of the land. I think this conclusion results from the decision of the Exchequer Chamber in ''[[Warlow v. Harrison]]''."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

This, however, was merely ''obiter'' because not only was the action once again not against the vendor but against the auctioneer, but also the court held that there could be no liability anyway, quite apart from the effect of the statute, because the plaintiff's agent had not tendered cash, but only a cheque, which the auctioneer was not bound to accept. The case is in any event unsatisfactory because the complaint made was that the auctioneer had refused to allow the plaintiff's agent to sign a memorandum on her behalf, but that would not have been of any use to her. What was required was a note or memorandum signed by or on behalf of the vendor.

On the other hand ''[[Rainbow v. Howkins]]'' [1904] 2 K.B. 322 , so far as it goes tells against the plaintiffs but again it is distinguishable, because the action was brought on the ground that the auctioneer was personally liable as if he were vendor under a contract of sale not upon a collateral contract, and alternatively for breach of warranty of authority, but it was held that he could not be sued on the first ground because of the statute, and could not be sued for breach of warranty of authority, because there was none since, apart from the statute, he had effectively bound the vendor.

[[Mr. Hoffmann]] also relied on ''[[Wood v. Midgley]]'' (1854) 2 Sm. &amp; G. 115 , and on appeal, 5 De G.M. &amp; G. 41. That, however, was not a case of an agreement to enter into a written agreement but of a concluded oral agreement for sale with a concurrent or collateral agreement to reduce it to writing, so that again is distinguishable.

In these circumstances in my judgment it is necessary to consider how the matter stands in principle. As I see it the question is whether the unilateral contract is - and I quote these words from section 40 - a "contract for the sale or other disposition of land or any interest in land."

It is clear to me that ''ex hypothesi'' it is not a contract for the sale of land or any interest in land because it is a separate and independent contract to enter into such a contract.

In my judgment, however, it is equally clearly a contract for some other disposition of an interest in land.

It is not necessary in my view that the interest in land to be disposed of should actually exist at the time of the contract. I cannot doubt that a contract for valuable consideration to grant an easement over Blackacre would be a contract for the disposition of an interest in land within the meaning of the section.

Now, in the present case we have a contract to enter into a proper written contract for the sale of land. Such a contract if entered into would be specifically enforceable and would therefore give the plaintiffs a right to the land in equity and so would create and give them an equitable interest in the land. It follows in my judgment that the unilateral contract was a contract to dispose of an interest in land, because it was a contract to do something which would have that effect in law.

The plaintiffs say: "But we are not claiming specific performance; only damages." That, however, in my view is an irrelevant consideration for two reasons. The first, which is I think conclusive, is that we are not concerned with whether the "unilateral contract" could be specifically enforced so as actually to create an interest in land, but whether it is a contract to do that which, if done, would create such an interest. The words of the section look only to the contract.

The second is that the plaintiffs cannot escape the impact of the section by limiting the nature of the relief they seek and, moreover, the damages for breach of the unilateral contract must, as I see it, be exactly the same as damages for breach of the contract of sale would have been if contracts had been exchanged and then broken by the plaintiffs.

If, however, contrary to my view it be necessary that the unilateral contract should be one capable of specific performance, in my judgment it is so notwithstanding the decision of Stirling J. on motion in ''[[Johnston v. Boyes]]'', 42 S.J. 610 , which with all respect to that judge is in my view incorrect.

For this purpose one must regard the matter apart from section 40, for if one postulates that the section applies, one begs the whole question. So regarded, I cannot see how a vendor can escape an order for specific performance by agreeing (with sufficient particularity to be effective in law) to agree to sell rather than by a direct agreement to sell.

The dictum of Lord Wright in ''[[Hillas and Co. Ltd. v. Arcos Ltd.]]'' (1932) 147 L.T. 503 , 515 "a contract de praesenti to enter into what, in law, is an enforceable contract is simply that enforceable contract, and no more and no less," with which I respectfully agree, does not directly apply, because prior to exchange of contracts which never took place the plaintiffs were not themselves bound to purchase or to enter into a contract to purchase. They could have resiled at the very last moment, even after tender, so that this was not a contract between A and B to make a contract between A and B, but a unilateral contract by A to enter into a particular contract with B, but in my view the principle must be the same.

I am fortified in this conclusion by the American case of ''[[Union Car Advertising Co. Inc. v. Boston Elevated Railway Co.]]'' (1928) 26 Fed.Rep. (2d) 755 , a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals, First Circuit. Mr. Godfrey pointed out that the court said, at p. 759:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"... it was virtually conceded by the plaintiff at the argument that under the law of Massachusetts an oral contract to execute a written contract for the sale or transfer of an interest in land is within the statute of frauds and invalid."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But the case before the court was not such a case but one of a contract not to be performed within the year. Therefore, he said, this American decision did not help because the position with regard to a contract for the sale or other disposition of an interest in land was not before the court, and anyway the court was dealing only with the law of Massachusetts.

So far as the second point is concerned the case is none the less persuasive authority, and as to the first, the citations in the judgment from other cases show that the concession was in truth in accordance with the law of that state, and show that law to be founded upon reasoning which commends itself to me and entirely accords with my own.

Thus in ''[[Sarkisian v. Teele]]'' (1909) 88 N.E. 333 , where the subject matter was an oral contract to execute an unsigned written contract to sell stock in trade and to let the business premises, the court said, at p. 334:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"... if the bill is considered as seeking to enforce an oral promise by the defendant to enter into the formal writing, as containing all the essential elements of the contract, it cannot be maintained," and again "By the statute of frauds such an agreement was required to be in writing, and an oral promise to execute a contract embodying these terms also comes within the statute."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Further in ''[[McLachlin v. Village of Whitehall]]'' (1906) 99 N.Y.S. 721 , as cited in 26 Fed.Rep. (2nd series) p. 758:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"... the trustees of the defendant village entered into an oral contract wherein it was agreed that if the plaintiff would increase his plant, so that he could furnish incandescent lights for private houses in the village, the trustees would renew..."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

the written contract he then had for lighting its street, which would otherwise expire in 1897. In that case the court said, at pp. 722-723:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The question is therefore presented whether damages can be recovered for the breach of an oral agreement to enter into a contract, which, under the statute of frauds, is required to be in writing. It is true that the oral agreement to enter into the written contract might be fully performed within a year or within a day. The action is not in form one to recover damages for a breach of contract for lighting the streets and public places for a term of five years, but for damages consequent upon a breach of the verbal agreement to award such a contract to the plaintiff. The damages, however, claimed as consequent upon such breach, are none other than the same damages as would have been recoverable for breach of the contract for lighting if it had been awarded to the plaintiff.... It is conceded that a contract for lighting for a term of five years would be void if not in writing, but if an oral agreement to enter into such a written contract is not also void, where the damages claimed for the breach of the oral agreement are not independent of it, but necessarily are the same as those which would arise from the breach of the written contract, the door would be open for the practical nullification of the statute of frauds in a large class of cases."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The law is similarly stated in 72 American Jurist (2nd Series), [[Statute of Frauds]], para. 4:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The general rule is that an oral agreement to reduce to writing a contract which is within the scope of the operation of the statute of frauds, or to sign an agreement which the statute of frauds requires to be in writing, is invalid and unenforceable."
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In my judgment, therefore, the unilateral contract in this case is ''[[prima facie]]'' unenforceable, and I turn to the third question.

The plaintiffs rely on all and every of the acts done by them to satisfy the conditions of the "unilateral contract," as being also sufficient acts of part performance.

The first defendants say that that cannot be so because nothing can be part performance if done before there is any binding contract. Mr. Hoffmann puts his case as high as saying that by definition there can never be part performance of a unilateral contract.

I doubt whether that is right as a general principle, since in most cases the performance of the condition by the offeree is also the discharge of all his obligations and is certainly done pursuant to the inchoate contract. I think in many cases the offeree's acts may amount to part performance, though I doubt whether in this case they caused sufficient prejudice to the plaintiffs to raise an equity on which the first defendants could be charged.

In my view, however, it is unnecessary to decide these questions since in my judgment the ease fails because none of the alleged acts of part performance of themselves suggests that there was any contract between the parties. Indeed they point to the exact opposite and suggest that the parties were about to make or contemplated making a contract. It is only if one first looks to see what the oral contract is, and finds that it is a unilateral contract, such as pleaded in this ease, that the acts can begin to be regarded as part performance, but that is an inquiry which one is not permitted to make: see per Lord Reid in ''[[Steadman v. Steadman]]'' [1976] A.C. 536 , 541-542, where he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I think that there has been some confusion between this supposed rule and another perfectly good rule. You must not first look at the oral contract and then see whether the alleged acts of part performance are consistent with it. You must first look at the alleged acts of part performance to see whether they prove that there must have been a contract and it is only if they do so prove that you can bring in the oral contract.... In my view, unless the law is to be divorced from reason and principle, the rule must be that you take the whole circumstances, leaving aside evidence about the oral contract, to see whether it is proved that the acts relied on were done in reliance on a contract: that will be proved if it is shown to be more probable than not."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lord Salmon appears to have taken a contrary view: he said, at p. 571:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In the present case, the payment of £100 by the husband to his wife who had divorced him - looked at without regard to its surrounding circumstances - would not be any evidence of any contract, let alone of a contract concerning land."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The other members of the court did not state the position so specifically one way or the other, but both Viscount Dilhorne at p. 553 and Lord Simon at p. 561 accepted the statement in Fry, Specific Performance of Contract, 6th ed. (1921), p. 278, section 582:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The true principle, however, of the operation of acts of part performance seems only to require that the acts in question be such as must be referred to some contract, and may be referred to the alleged one; that they prove the existence of some contract, and are consistent with the contract alleged,"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

approved by Upjohn L.J. in ''[[Kingswood Estate Co. Ltd. v. Anderson]]'' [1963] 2 Q.B. 169 , 189. Here, of course, the acts do not prove any contract.

The plaintiffs argue that whilst one may not look to see what oral contract is alleged, one may look at the promise made as part of the surrounding circumstances and then the alleged acts of part performance are explained and shown to be referable to the existence of a contract; but that, with all respect, I reject as too subtle, and in reality looking to and examining the alleged acts of part performance in the light of the alleged contract.

For these reasons in my judgment the plaintiffs fail on the third question also, and I would dismiss this appeal. I intended to say that I would do so with considerable regret as the first defendants' conduct unexplained appeared to me to be unmeritorious. However, this case having been heard simply on an application to strike out the statement of claim as disclosing no cause of action, the motives or reasons which influenced the defendants have not been investigated, and we were informed by counsel that at the very last moment the mortgagors found a purchaser at a higher price and so they felt themselves bound to reject the plaintiffs despite the assurances they had given them. It seems, therefore, that in this particular case there may be a good explanation and I leave it there.}}

The '''Durationator''' is a copyright tool developed at [[Tulane University Law School|Tulane Law School]] by Dr. Elizabeth Townsend Gard and her team of law students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law School Venture, The Durationator® Selected for Idea Village Entrepreneur Challenge|url=http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlsNews/newsItem.aspx?id=14622|website=Tulane.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now licensed to Limited Times, a social venture, to develop into a product. The Durationator takes research done at the law school and transforms it into code using what is designed to be an accessible tool, to determine the [[copyright]] status of a work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/two_reluctant_entrepreneurs_tackle_the_challenge_of_copyright_duration_into&lt;/ref&gt;

The Durationator began as an idea in 2007, when  Matt Miller, a 2L law student with previous [[Computer programming|coding]] experience, applied to be a research assistant.  He had previous coding experience.  Townsend Gard had been working on copyright, and in particular the copyright status of works.  Legals terms can be complicated, and the idea was to blend the research and code.  Initial estimates were for the project to be completed in the summer, but it took ten years.

The research has focused on all of the elements that need to go into making a decision about the status of the work in whatever country is being searched.  These elements can vary greatly.  The team has also attempted to gather every law regarding copyright, creating a searchable database. The tool uses [[Logicnets]] as its platform, a logic tree search engine.

The Durationator has been indirectly cited by U.S. Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] in ''[[Golan v. Holder]]'', referencing the complexity of copyright law and the need for code to sort it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3239612723066820072&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversy was caused in [[New Zealand]] in 2014 when the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] allegedly used the song "[[Lose Yourself]]" by the American rapper [[Eminem]] in a campaign advertisement during [[New Zealand general election, 2014|that year's election]]. The Wellington High Court ruled against the National Party, ordering them to pay over $600,000 for copyright infringement.

==Background==
On 16 September 2016, [[Eminem]]'s publishers filed a lawsuit with the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] in Wellington, claiming that the National Party had made a copyright infringement from using an instrumental version of the song "[[Lose Yourself]]" in television advertisements without their consent. Their campaign manager [[Steven Joyce]] stated their using of the song was "pretty legal", claiming it had been purchased from an Australian music library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Eminem suing New Zealand's National party for allegedly using his song |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/16/eminem-suing-new-zealands-national-party-for-allegedly-using-his-song |publisher= The Guardian |date= 16 September 2014 |accessdate= 17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Nikki |last= Papatsoumas |date= 16 September 2014 |title= National Party sued over Eminem copyright infringment |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11325727 |publisher= The New Zealand Herald |accessdate= 17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publishers counter-claimed that they never allowed the song to be used in a political advert. They have persisted with the lawsuit and a trial began at the [[Wellington]] High Court on 1 May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |date= 8 September 2016 |title= Court date set for Eminem vs New Zealand National Party |url= https://nz.news.yahoo.com/top-stories/a/32565722/court-date-set-for-eminem-vs-new-zealand-national-party-copyright-infringement-case/#page1 |publisher= Yahoo News |accessdate= 8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case concluded on 12 May 2017; Justice Helen Cull reserved her decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11855413 It's a rap: Eminem lawsuit against New Zealand party ends] New Zealand Herald, 12 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October, the High Court ruled that the National Party had breached copyright and ordered them to pay $600,000 plus interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/music/95132686/national-party-loses-court-decision-on-use-of-eminemesque-song|title=National Party loses copyright case over use of Eminem-esque, ordered to pay $600k|date=2017-10-25|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[Eight Mile Style]] spokesman Joel Martin said the company was happy with the result following a "distasteful" trial for them, while National Party president Peter Goodfellow said the party was disappointed with the final verdict and would proceed themselves to pursue legal action against Labrador and Beatbox, who supplied them the music.&lt;ref name="insulting"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=11936806 |title=National Party 'insulting' in action over Eminem copyright |date=26 October 2017 |publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eminem told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that he was not consulted about the case, but should he receive any money from it he would donate it to charity for the [[Hurricane Harvey]] relief efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/342482/eminem-to-donate-legal-win-money-to-charity |title=Eminem to donate legal win money to charity |date=27 October 2017 |publisher=Radio New Zealand |accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Musician and former [[Australasian Performing Right Association|APRA]] director [[Mike Chunn]] said that [[sound-alike]] recordings are routinely used in advertising and that the ruling was unfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/342383/music-rights-specialist-backs-national-over-eminem-esque |title=Music rights specialist backs National over 'Eminem Esque' |date=27 October 2017 |publisher=Radio New Zealand |accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Party are set to appeal the ruling saying the damages should have been lower and a cross-appeal from US companies Eight Mile Style and Martin Affiliated seek the damages to be increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/100082877/appeal-grounds-revealed-in-eminem-copyright-case-against-national-party |title=Appeal grounds revealed in Eminem copyright case against National Party |date=21 December 2017 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Warof1812-Origins}}

The '''Embargo Act of 1807''' was a general [[embargo]] enacted by the United States Congress against Great Britain and France during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

The embargo was imposed in response to the violations of the United States [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]], in which American [[Cargo ship|merchantmen]] and their cargo were seized as contraband of war by the belligerent European navies. The British Royal Navy, in particular, resorted to [[impressment]], forcing thousands of British-American seamen into service on their warships (under British law of the time, having been born British they were still subjects of the Crown). Britain and France, engaged in the Napoleonic Wars, rationalized the plunder of U.S. shipping as incidental to war and necessary for their survival. Americans saw the [[Chesapeake-Leopard Affair]] as a particularly egregious example of a British violation of American neutrality. Perceived diplomatic insults and unwarranted official orders issued in support of these actions by European powers were argued by some to be grounds for a U.S. declaration of war.

President [[Thomas Jefferson]] acted with restraint as these antagonisms mounted, weighing public support for retaliation. He recommended that Congress respond with commercial warfare,  rather than with military mobilization. The Embargo Act was signed into law on December 22, 1807.  The anticipated effect of this measure – economic hardship for the belligerent nations – was expected to chasten Great Britain and France, and force them to end their molestation of American shipping, respect U.S. neutrality, and cease the policy of impressment. The embargo turned out to be impractical as a coercive measure, and was a failure both diplomatically and economically. As implemented, the legislation inflicted devastating burdens on the U.S. economy and the American people.

Widespread evasion of the maritime and inland trade restrictions by American merchants, as well as loopholes in the legislation, greatly reduced the impact of the embargo on the intended targets in Europe. British merchant marine appropriated the lucrative trade routes relinquished by U.S. shippers due to the embargo. Demand for English goods rose  in South America, offsetting losses suffered as a result of Non-Importation Acts. The embargo undermined national unity in the U.S., provoking bitter protests, especially in New England commercial centers. The issue vastly increased support for the Federalist Party and led to huge gains in their representation in Congress and in the electoral college in 1808. The embargo had the effect of simultaneously undermining American citizens' faith that their government could execute its own laws fairly, and strengthening the conviction among America's enemies that its republican form of government was inept and ineffectual. At the end of 15 months, the embargo was revoked on March 1, 1809, in the last days of [[Presidency of Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson's presidency]]. Tensions with Britain continued to grow, [[Origins of the War of 1812|leading]] to the [[War of 1812]].

==Background==
After the short truce in 1802–1803 the European wars resumed and continued until the defeat of Napoleon in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;He returned for 100 days in 1815 but that had no bearing on the U.S.&lt;/ref&gt; The war caused American relations with both Britain and France to deteriorate rapidly. There was grave risk of war with one or the other. With Britain supreme on the sea, and France on the land, the war developed into a struggle of blockade and counterblockade. This commercial war peaked in 1806 and 1807. Britain's Royal Navy shut down most European harbors to American ships unless they first traded through British ports. France declared a paper blockade of Britain (which it lacked a navy to enforce) and seized American ships that obeyed British regulations. The Royal Navy needed large numbers of sailors, and saw the U.S. merchant fleet as a haven for British sailors.&lt;ref&gt;Brian DeToy, "The Impressment of American Seamen during the Napoleonic Wars," ''Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 1750–1850: Selected Papers, 1998'' (1988) pp. 492–501&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Official Presidential portrait of Thomas Jefferson (by Rembrandt Peale, 1800).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Thomas Jefferson]]
The British system of [[impressment]] humiliated and dishonored the U.S. because it was unable to protect its ships and their sailors.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Gilje, "'Free Trade and Sailors' Rights': The Rhetoric of the War of 1812," ''Journal of the Early Republic,'' Spring 2010, Vol. 30 Issue 1, pp. 1–23&lt;/ref&gt; This British practice of taking British deserters, and often Americans, from American ships and forcing them into the Royal Navy increased greatly after 1803, and caused bitter anger in the United States.

On June 21, 1807 the American warship USS ''Chesapeake'' was [[Chesapeake–Leopard Affair|attacked and boarded on the high seas]] off the coast of Norfolk, VA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Embargo of 1807|url=https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/embargo-1807#Non-Importation_Acts|publisher=Monticello and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation|accessdate=December 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the British warship HMS Leopard. Three Americans were dead and 18 wounded; the British impressed four seamen with American papers as alleged deserters. The outraged nation demanded action;  President Jefferson ordered all British ships out of American waters.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Tucker, ''Injured Honor: The Chesapeake-Leopard Affair'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial legislation==
Passed on December 22, 1807, the Act:&lt;ref&gt;[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=002/llsl002.db&amp;recNum=488 2 Stat. 451 (1807)] Library of Congress, U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875&lt;/ref&gt;
* laid an embargo on all ships and vessels under U.S. jurisdiction,
* prevented all ships and vessels from obtaining clearance to undertake in voyages to foreign ports or places,
* allowed the President of the United States to make exceptions for vessels under his immediate direction,
* authorized the President to enforce via instructions to revenue officers and the Navy,
* was not constructed to prevent the departure of any foreign ship or vessel, with or without cargo on board,
* required a bond or surety from merchant ships on a voyage between U.S. ports, and
* exempted warships from the embargo provisions.

This [[embargo|shipping embargo]] was a cumulative addition to the [[Non-importation Act]] of 1806 (2 Stat. 379), this earlier act being a "Prohibition of the Importation of certain Goods and Merchandise from the Kingdom of Great Britain"; the prohibited imported goods being defined where their chief value which consists of leather, silk, hemp or flax, tin or brass, wool, glass; in addition paper goods, nails, hats, clothing, and beer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=002/llsl002.db&amp;recNum=416 2 Stat. 379 (1806)] Library of Congress, U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875&lt;/ref&gt;

The Embargo Act of 1807 is codified at 2 [[United States Statutes at Large|Stat.]] 451 and formally titled "An Embargo laid on Ships and Vessels in the Ports and Harbours of the United States". The bill was drafted at the request of President [[Thomas Jefferson]] and subsequently passed by the [[10th United States Congress|Tenth U.S. Congress]], on December 22, 1807, during Session 1; Chapter 5. Congress initially acted to enforce a bill prohibiting imports, but supplements to the bill eventually banned exports as well.

==Impact on U.S.==
The embargo, which lasted from December 1807 to March 1809 effectively throttled American overseas trade. All areas of the United States suffered. In commercial New England and the Middle Atlantic states, ships rotted at the wharves, and in the agricultural areas, particularly in the South, farmers and planters could not sell their crops on the international market. For New England, and especially for the Middle Atlantic states, there was some consolation, for the scarcity of European goods meant that a definite stimulus was given to the development of American industry.

The embargo was a financial disaster for the Americans because the British were still able to export goods to America: initial loopholes overlooked smuggling by coastal vessels from Canada, whaling ships and privateers from overseas; and widespread disregard of the law meant enforcement was difficult.&lt;ref name=malone&gt;{{cite book|last=Malone |first=Dumas |title=Jefferson the President: The Second Term |location=Boston |publisher=Brown-Little |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study by economic historian Douglas Irwin estimates that the embargo cost about 5 percent of America's 1807 GNP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Irwin|first=Douglas|date=2005|title=The Welfare Cost of Autarky: Evidence from the Jeffersonian Trade Embargo, 1807–09|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9396.2005.00527.x|journal=Review of International economics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==
A case study of Rhode Island shows the embargo devastated shipping-related industries, wrecked existing markets, and caused an increase in opposition to the [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. [[Smuggling]] was widely endorsed by the public, who viewed the embargo as a violation of their rights. Public outcry continued, helping the Federalists regain control of the state government in 1808–09. The case is a rare example of American national foreign policy altering local patterns of political allegiance. Despite its unpopular nature, the Embargo Act did have some limited, unintended benefits to the Northeastern region especially as it drove capital and labor into New England textile and other manufacturing industries, lessening America's reliance on the British.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Strum, "Rhode Island and the Embargo of 1807." ''Rhode Island History'' 1994 52(2): 58–67&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vermont, the embargo was doomed to failure on the Lake Champlain-Richelieu River water route because of Vermont's dependence on a Canadian outlet for produce. At St. John, Lower Canada, £140,000 worth of goods smuggled by water were recorded there in 1808 – a 31% increase over 1807. Shipments of ashes (used to make soap) nearly doubled to £54,000, but lumber dropped 23% to £11,200. Manufactured goods, which had expanded to £50,000 since Jay's Treaty of 1795, fell over 20%, especially articles made near Tidewater. Newspapers and manuscripts recorded more lake activity than usual, despite the theoretical reduction in shipping that should accompany an embargo.  The smuggling was not restricted to water routes, as herds were readily driven across the uncontrollable land border. Southbound commerce gained two-thirds overall, but furs dropped a third. Customs officials maintained a stance of vigorous enforcement throughout and Gallatin's Enforcement Act (1809) was a party issue. Many Vermonters preferred the embargo's exciting game of revenuers versus smugglers, bringing high profits, versus mundane, low-profit normal trade.&lt;ref&gt;H. Nicholas Muller, "Smuggling into Canada: How the Champlain Valley Defied Jefferson's Embargo."  ''Vermont History'' 1970 38(1): 5–21&lt;/ref&gt;

The New England merchants who evaded the embargo were imaginative, daring, and versatile in their violation of federal law. Gordinier (2001) examines how the merchants of New London, Connecticut, organized and managed the cargoes purchased and sold, and the vessels used  during the years before, during, and after the embargo. Trade routes and cargoes, both foreign and domestic, along with the vessel types, and the ways their ownership and management were organized show the merchants of southeastern Connecticut evinced versatility in the face of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Stine Gordinier, "Versatility in Crisis: The Merchants of the New London Customs District Respond to the Embargo of 1807–1809."  PhD dissertation U. of Connecticut 2001. 333 pp.  DAI 2001 62(2): 739-A. DA3004842&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordinier (2001) concludes the versatile merchants sought alternative strategies for their commerce, and to a lesser extent, for their navigation. They tried extra-legal activities, a reduction in the size of the foreign fleet, and the re-documentation of foreign trading vessels into domestic carriage. Most importantly, they sought new domestic trading partners, and took advantage of the political power of [[Jedidiah Huntington]], the Customs Collector. Huntington was an influential member of the Connecticut leadership class (called "the Standing Order");  he allowed scores of embargoed vessels to depart for foreign ports under the guise of "special permission." Old modes of sharing vessel ownership in order to share the risk proved to be hard to modify. Instead established relationships continued through the embargo crisis, in spite of numerous bankruptcies.&lt;ref&gt;Gordinier (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement efforts==
Jefferson's Secretary of the Treasury [[Albert Gallatin]] was against the entire embargo, foreseeing correctly the impossibility of enforcing the policy and the negative public reaction. "As to the hope that it may...induce England to treat us better," wrote Gallatin to Jefferson shortly after the bill had become law, "I think is entirely groundless...government prohibitions do always more mischief than had been calculated; and it is not without much hesitation that a statesman should hazard to regulate the concerns of individuals as if he could do it better than themselves."&lt;ref name=adams&gt;{{cite book |title= Gallatin to Jefferson, December 1807 |volume= 1 |last=Adams |first=Henry |work=The Writings of Albert Gallatin |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott |year=1879}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|368}}

Since the bill hindered U.S. ships from leaving American ports bound for foreign trade; it had the side-effect of hindering American exploration.

===First supplementary act===
Just weeks later, on January 8, 1808, legislation again passed the Tenth U.S. Congress, Session 1; Chapter 8: "An Act supplementary..." to the Embargo Act (2 Stat. 453). As historian Forrest McDonald wrote, "A loophole had been discovered" in the initial enactment, "namely that coasting vessels, and fishing and whaling boats" had been exempt from the embargo, and they had been circumventing it, primarily via Canada. This '''supplementary act''' extended the bonding provision (i.e. Section 2 of the initial Embargo Act) to those of purely ''domestic'' trades:&lt;ref&gt;[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=002/llsl002.db&amp;recNum=490 2 Stat. 453 (1808)] Library of Congress, U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sections 1 and 2 of the supplementary act required bonding to coasting, fishing and whaling ships and vessels. Even ''river boats'' had to post bond.
* Section 3 made violations of either the initial or supplementary act an offense; failure of the shipowner to comply would result in forfeiture of the ship and its cargo, or a fine of double that value, and denial of credit for use in custom duties; a captain failing to comply would be fined between one and twenty thousand dollars, and would forfeit the ability to swear an oath before any customs officer.
* Section 4 removed the warship exemption from applying to [[privateers]] or vessels with a [[letter of marque]].
* Section 5 established a fine for foreign ships loading merchandise for export, and allowed for its seizure.

Meanwhile, Jefferson requested authorization from Congress to raise 30,000 troops from the current standing army of 2,800. Congress refused. With their harbors for the most part unusable in the winter anyway, New England and the north ports of the mid-Atlantic states had paid little notice to the previous embargo acts. That was to change with the spring thaw, and the passing of yet another embargo act.&lt;ref name=adams/&gt;{{rp|147}}

With the coming of the spring, the effect of the previous acts were immediately felt throughout the coastal states, especially in New England. An economic downturn turned into a depression and caused increasing unemployment. Protests occurred up and down the eastern coast. Most merchants and shippers simply ignored the laws. On the Canada–US border, especially in upstate New York and Vermont, the embargo laws were openly flouted. Federal officials believed parts of Maine, such as [[Passamaquoddy Bay]] on the border with British-held [[New Brunswick]], were in open rebellion. By March, an increasingly frustrated Jefferson was resolved to enforce the embargo to the letter.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Other supplements to the Act===
On March 12, 1808, Congress passed and Jefferson signed into law yet another supplement to the Embargo Act. This supplement{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} prohibited, for the first time, all exports of any goods, whether by land or by sea. Violators were subject to a fine of US$10,000, plus forfeiture of goods, per offense. It granted the President broad discretionary authority to enforce, deny, or grant exceptions to the embargo.&lt;ref name=adams/&gt;{{rp|144}} Port authorities were authorized to seize cargoes without a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] and to try any shipper or merchant who was thought to have merely contemplated violating the embargo.

Despite the added penalties, citizens and shippers openly ignored the embargo. Protests continued to grow; and so it was that the Jefferson administration requested and Congress rendered yet another embargo act.

==Consequences==
[[File:Ograbme.jpg|thumb|300px|A political cartoon showing merchants dodging the "Ograbme", which is "Embargo" spelled backwards. The embargo was also ridiculed in the New England press as ''Dambargo'', ''Mob-Rage'', or ''Go-bar-'em''.]]

The Embargo was hurting the United States as much as Britain or France. Britain, expecting to suffer most from the American regulations, built up a new South American market for its exports, and the British shipowners were pleased that American competition had been removed by the action of the U.S. government.

Jefferson placed himself in a strange position with his Embargo policy. Though he had so frequently and eloquently argued for as little government intervention as possible, he now found himself assuming extraordinary powers in an attempt to enforce his policy. The presidential election of 1808, in which [[James Madison]] defeated [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]], showed that the Federalists were regaining strength, and helped to convince Jefferson and Madison that the Embargo would have to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Tucker and David C. Hendrickson, ''Empire of Liberty: The Statecraft of Thomas Jefferson'' (1990) ch 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before leaving office, in March 1809, Jefferson signed the repeal of the failed Embargo. Despite its unpopular nature, the Embargo Act did have some limited, unintended benefits, especially as entrepreneurs and workers responded by bringing in fresh capital and labor into New England textile and other manufacturing industries, lessening America's reliance on the British merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Strum (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey A. Frankel, "The 1807–1809 Embargo Against Great Britain." ''Journal of Economic History'' (1982) 42#2 pp. 291–308. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2120129 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repealing the legislation===
On March 1, 1809, Congress passed the [[Non-Intercourse Act (1809)|Non-Intercourse Act]], a law that enabled the President, once the wars of Europe ended, to declare the country sufficiently safe and to allow foreign trade with certain nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=David Stephen Heidler  and Jeanne T. Heidler, eds.|first=|title=Encyclopedia of the War of 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_c09EJgek50C&amp;pg=PA390|year=2004|pages=390–91|isbn=9781591143628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810 the government was ready to try yet another tactic of economic coercion, in the desperate measure known as [[Macon's Bill Number 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garry Wills|first=|title=James Madison: The American Presidents Series: The 4th President, 1809-1817|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EtEqdvpuOwQC&amp;pg=PA87|year=2002|page=87|isbn=9780805069051}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill became law on May 1, 1810, and replaced the Non-Intercourse Act. It was an acknowledgment of the failure of economic pressure to coerce the European powers. Trade with both Britain and France was now thrown open, and the United States attempted to bargain with the two belligerents. If either power would remove her restrictions on American commerce, the United States would reapply non-intercourse against the power that had not so acted. Napoleon quickly took advantage of this opportunity. He promised that his Berlin and Milan Decrees would be repealed, and Madison reinstated non-intercourse against Britain in the fall of 1810. Though Napoleon did not fulfill his promise, strained Anglo-American relations prevented his being brought to task for his duplicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merrill|first1=Dennis|last2=Paterson|first2=Thomas|title=Major Problems in American Foreign Relations: To 1920|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=spA88Rt23soC&amp;pg=PA132|accessdate=December 21, 2011|date=September 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-547-21824-3|pages=132–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempt of Jefferson and Madison to resist aggression by peaceful means gained a belated success in June 1812 when Britain finally promised to repeal her Orders in Council. The British concession was too late, for by the time the news reached America the United States had already declared the [[War of 1812]] against Britain.

The entire series of events was ridiculed in the press as ''Dambargo'', ''Mob-Rage'', ''Go-bar-'em'' or ''O-grab-me'' ("Embargo" spelled backward); there was a cartoon ridiculing the Act as a [[Common Snapping Turtle|snapping turtle]], named "O' grab me", grabbing at American shipping.

==Wartime legislation==
America's declaration of war, in mid-June 1812, was followed shortly by the Enemy Trade Act of 1812 on July 6, which employed similar restrictions as previous legislation;  it was likewise ineffective and tightened in December 1813, and debated for further tightening in December 1814.  After existing embargoes expired with the onset of war, the Embargo Act of 1813 was signed into law December 17, 1813.  Four new restrictions were included: An embargo prohibiting all American ships and goods from leaving port;  a complete ban on certain commodities customarily produced in the British Empire; a ban against foreign ships trading in American ports unless 75% of the crew were citizens of the ship's flag; and a ban on ransoming ships. The Embargo of  1813 was the nation's last great trade restriction. Never again would the US government cut off all its trade to achieve a foreign policy objective.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Hickey, ''The War of 1812 – A Forgotten Conflict'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=390r2-ayPY0C&amp;pg=PA159&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ch.7: The Last Embargo]  pp. 172, 181.&lt;/ref&gt;  The act particularly hurt the northeastern states, since the British kept a tighter blockade on the south, and thus encouraged American opposition to the administration. To make his point, the act was not lifted by Madison until after the defeat of Napoleon, and the point was moot.  On February 15, 1815, Madison signed the [[Enemy Trade Act of 1815]]; it was tighter than any previous trade restriction including the Enforcement Act of 1809 (January 9) and the Embargo of 1813, but it would expire two weeks later when official word of peace from Ghent was received.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer C. Tucker, Ed. ''The Encyclopedia Of the War Of 1812, a political, social, and military history'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=VljA5QEI9_wC&amp;pg=PA221 pp. 221–25], ABC-CLIO, (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gaming Act 1845''' (8 &amp; 9 Vict., c. 109) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The Act's principal provision was to deem a [[Gambling|wager]] unenforceable as a legal [[contract]]. The Act received [[Royal Assent]] on August 8, 1845. Sections 17 and 18, though amended, remained in force until 1 September 2007.

==Background==
Increasing concern as to the damaging social effects of [[gambling]]&lt;ref&gt;Miers (2002) ''p.''20&lt;/ref&gt; gave rise to a [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] whose recommendations were implemented by the Act.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons (1844)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[public policy|policy]] of the Act was to discourage betting.&lt;ref&gt;''Hill v. William Hill (Park Lane) Limited'' [1949] AC 530, at 548 ''per'' [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Viscount Simon]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, following a 2001 report by Sir [[Alan Budd]],&lt;ref&gt;Budd (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002, the UK government accepted that wagers should cease to be unenforceable as contracts, seeking to introduce a new liberalised regulatory regime in order to encourage the gambling industry.&lt;ref&gt;Gambling Review (2002) 4.7/ r.108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repeals==
Sections 1 to 9 and 15 and 16 and 19 to 24 and 26, and the First and Second Schedules, were repealed by Part I of Schedule 6 to the [[Betting and Gaming Act 1960]].

Sections 10 to 14 and the Third Schedule were repealed by section 1 of, and the Schedule to, the [[Billiards (Abolition of Restrictions) Act 1987]]

Section 25 was repealed by Part XIX of Schedule 1 to the [[Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1976]]

This Act was repealed for Northern Ireland by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1985/1204/article/187 article 187(4)] of, and Schedule 21 to, the [[Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and Amusements (Northern Ireland) Order 1985]] (S.I. 1985/1204 (N.I. 11)).

==Exclusion==
This Act was excluded by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/65/section/16 section 16(4)] of the [[Gaming Act 1968]].

== Section 1 – Repeal of part of the Unlawful Games Act 1541==
Section 1 repealed the [[Unlawful Games Act 1541]] (33 Hen 8 c 9), as to so much
* whereby any [[game of skill|game of mere skill]], such as [[lawn bowling|bowling]], coyting, cloyshcayls, half bowl, [[real tennis|tennis]] or the like, was declared an unlawful game,
* which enacted any penalty for playing at any such game of skill as aforesaid,
*which enacts any penalty for lacking [[bow and arrows|bows or arrows]], or for not making and continuing [[Butt (archery)|butts]],
* which regulates the making, selling, or using of bows and arrows,
* requires the [[mayor]]s, [[sheriff]]s, [[bailiff]]s, [[constable]]s, and other head officers within every city, borough, and town within the Realm, to make search weekly, or at the farthest once a month, in all places where houses, alleys, plays, or places of dicing, carding, or gaming shall be suspected to be had, kept, and maintained,
* as makes it lawful for every master to license his or their servants, and for every [[nobleman]] and other having manors, lands, tenements, or other yearly profits for term of life, in his own right or in his wife's right, to the yearly value of an hundred pounds or above, to command, appoint, or license, by his or their discretion, his or their servants or family of his or their house or houses to play at [[card games|cards]], [[dice]], or tables, or any unlawful game.

It provides such commandment, appointment, or licence shall not avail any person to exempt him from the danger or penalty of playing at any unlawful game or in any common gaming house.

==Section 15 – Repeal of other laws==
Section 15 repeals the following:
* Gaming Act 1664 16 Cha. 7
* [[Gaming Act 1710]] 9 Ann, c. 19 as was not amended by Gaming Act 1835 5 &amp; 6 Wil. 4 c. 41
* Gaming Act 1744 18 Geo, 2 c.34
: * as relates to Gaming Act 1710 9 Ann c. 19 and
: * as renders any person liable to be indicted and punished for winning or losing, at play or by betting, at any one time, the sum or value of ten pounds, or within the space of twenty-four hours the sum or value of twenty pounds.

==Section 17 – Cheating at play==
{{see also|Cheating (law)}}

This section created an offence. At the time of its repeal this section read:

{{Blockquote|. . . every person who shall, by any fraud or unlawful device or ill practice in playing at or with cards, dice, tables, or other game, or in bearing a part in the stakes, wages, or adventures, or in betting on the sides or hands of them that do play, or in wagering on the event of any game, sport, pastime, or exercise, win from any other person to himself, or any other or others, any sum of money or valuable thing, shall -
:[(a)on [[conviction]] on [[indictment]] be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or
:(b)on [[summary conviction]] be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding two hundred pounds or to both.]}}

The words of enactment at the start were repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1891]].

The words in square brackets were substituted for the words "be deemed guilty of obtaining such money or valuable thing from such other person by a false pretence, with intent to cheat or defraud such person of the same, and, being convicted thereof, shall be punished accordingly" by sections 33(2) and 36(3) of, and Part III of Schedule 2 to, the [[Theft Act 1968]].

'''Two hundred pounds'''

Section 32(2) of the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] provided that the reference to two hundred pounds was to be construed as a reference to the [[prescribed sum]].

The following cases are relevant:
*R v Darley (1826) 1 Stark NP 359, (1826) 171 [[English Reports|ER]] [http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1814/137.pdf 497]

In 2005, Kwong Lee, Martin Fitz and Shuhal Miah were found guilty of cheating at [[roulette]] under this section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/incomingFeeds/article1293306.ece |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505114102/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/incomingFeeds/article1293306.ece |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-05-05 |title=Trapped by a sting that won too much |accessdate=2007-08-04 |work=TimesOnline  | location=London}}  - this article implies that the three were the first to be convicted under the Act but many cases are cited in {{cite book | author=Richardson, P.J. (ed.) | title=Archbold: Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice | year=2007 | publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell | location=London | isbn=0-421-94830-2 | pages='''22–70''' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Section 18 – Gambling contracts deemed void==
This section read:
{{ quotation | All contracts or agreements, whether by parole or in writing, by way of gaming or wagering, shall be null and void; and no suit shall be brought or maintained in any court of law and equity for recovering any sum of money or valuable thing alleged to be won upon any wager, or which shall have been deposited in the hands of any person to abide the event on which any wager shall have been made: Provided always, that this enactment shall not be deemed to apply to any subscription or contribution, or agreement to subscribe or contribute, for or towards any plate, prize, or sum of money to be awarded to the winner or winners of any lawful game, sport, pastime, or exercise. }}

This section was extended by the [[Gaming Act 1892]].

However, a bet on the Horserace Totalisator Board, also known as [[The Tote]], did not fall within the scope of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tote Investors v Smoker]]'' [1968] 1 QB 509&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, by the 1980s, it was feared that complex commercial [[risk management]] instruments and contracts, such as [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s could fall foul of the '''Act'''. Provision was made that a contract would not be void if at least one of the parties entered into it for legitimate business purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Financial Services Act 1986]], s.63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ_-B7d6ghIC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;ots=c3uM0lfmKq&amp;sig=7vOAKFHIBAcu02WKXQ1ft32xfOY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result#PPA183,M1 | pages=''p.''183 | title=Derivatives Handbook: Risk Management and Control |author1=Schwartz, R. J.  |author2=Smith, C. W. | publisher=Wiley | year=1997 | isbn=0471157651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exemption is now found in the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]] s 412.&lt;ref&gt;412.— Gaming contracts. (1) No contract to which this section applies is void or unenforceable because of– (a) Article 170 of the Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and Amusements (Northern Ireland) Order 1985; or (2) This section applies to a contract if– (a) it is entered into by either or each party by way of business; (b) the entering into or performance of it by either party constitutes an activity of a specified kind or one which falls within a specified class of activity; and (c) it relates to an investment of a specified kind or one which falls within a specified class of investment. (3) Part II of Schedule 2 applies for the purposes of subsection (2)(c), with the references to section 22 being read as references to that subsection. (4) Nothing in Part II of Schedule 2, as applied by subsection (3), limits the power conferred by subsection (2)(c). (5) “Investment” includes any asset, right or interest. (6) “Specified” means specified in an order made by the Treasury.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Section 19 – Feigned issues abolished==
Court of law or equity that desired to have any [[question of fact]] decided by a [[jury]] had it presented in the form of feigned issues, by stating that a wager was laid between two parties interested in respectively maintaining the affirmative and the negative of certain propositions. It was enacted that in every case where any court of law or equity desires to have any question of fact decided by a jury it should the directly state the question of fact in dispute, with such persons being plaintiffs and defendants as the court may direct, rather than as a feigned issue of a wager.

==Ireland and Northern Ireland==
The Act was in force in [[Ireland]] until [[Partition of Ireland|partition]]. It consequently became the law of the [[Irish Free State]] on 6 December 1922, and then of its successor states. When the autonomous region of [[Northern Ireland]] seceded from the Irish Free State and rejoined the [[United Kingdom]] on 7 December 1922, the Act became the law of Northern Ireland until repeal.

==Cases==
*''[[Close v Wilson]]'' [2011] EWCA Civ 5, a promise to money paid under an agreement to bet cannot be enforced because of the Gaming Act 1892 s 1, but the payer has a claim in restitution for the winnings and for any money used for purposes other than betting.

The '''Greek–Romanian Non-Aggression and Arbitration Pact''' was a non-aggression pact signed between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] on 21 March 1928. The pact effectively ended Greece's diplomatic isolation within the [[Balkans|Balkan]] peninsula, strengthening its position on the negotiating table with [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Turkey]]. Romania on the other hand gained a regional ally against its Slavic neighbors.

==Background==
Greco–Romanian relations can be traced back hundreds of years when the two formed a bastion of the [[Greco-Roman world]] in Balkans. They were to continue into the 14th century when the Principalities of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] became a refuge for Greeks fleeing from the rapidly declining [[Byzantine Empire]]. During the period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] domination Greek [[Phanariotes]] played an important role in the political and cultural life of modern-day Romania. Their influence being one of the reason that the [[Greek War of Independence]] was launched in the [[Danubian Principalities]] instead of Greece itself. Negotiations between the [[United Principalities]] and the now independent Greek state during the period of 1866–1869 proved fruitless. Romanian hopes of achieving independence through dialog in conjunction with the birth of Romanian national historiography which sharply criticized the Phanariotes being the main obstacles. Events  surrounding the [[Great Eastern Crisis]] such as the foundation of the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] and the threat of [[Pan-Slavism]] reversed the situation. The [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]] marked not only the creation of an independent Romania but also the restoration of amiable diplomatic relations between the two states. Having abandoned all claims to [[Transylvania]] and [[Bukovina]] Romania turned its attention to the Bulgarian held [[Southern Dobruja]]. Since the area's Romanian population was sparse, Romania sought to instill nationalist ideals in the [[Aromanians]] populating Ottoman-ruled [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The Aromanians were then to settle in South Dobruja thus reinforcing Romanian claims to the region.{{sfn|Sfetas|2001|pp=23–30}}

Organizations such as the [[Society of Macedono–Romanian Culture]] funded ethnographic expeditions to Macedonia, [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]], funding was allocated to the creation of Romanian speaking schools and churches.{{sfn|Sfetas|2001|pp=30–31}} This coincided with the wider [[Macedonian Struggle]] conflict where similar organizations of Greek, Bulgarian and Serbian origin not only propagated their culture but also engaged in armed struggle against each other and the Ottoman authorities.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=215–254}} Romanian influence in Macedonia remained limited as its schools lacked the necessary funding, moreover the Aromanians struggled to adapt to the Romanian language as taught in the schools. In 1896 Ottoman authorities refused to appoint a Romanian [[metropolitan bishop]] to the Aromanian communities. Romanian authorities bribed Ottoman officials with 100,000 [[gold franc]]s, however when the Ottoman sultan demanded a formal alliance the Romanians broke off negotiations. Another important issue was the status of the inheritances of [[Greeks in Romania]].{{sfn|Sfetas|2001|pp=33–41}}

In 1892, Romania refused to hand over the property of the recently deceased Greek expatriate [[Konstantinos Zappas]] to the Greek state, citing an article of the Romanian constitution forbidding foreign nationals from owning agricultural land. The then Greek government under [[Charilaos Trikoupis]]n recalled its ambassador in Bucharest and Romania followed suit, thus severing diplomatic relations between the two countries. Diplomatic relations were restored in July 1896, in response to a rise of Bulgarian [[komitadji]] activity in Macedonia. The assassination of Romanian professor [[Ștefan Mihăileanu]] by a komitadji agent on 22 July 1900, caused panic in Bucharest amidst fears of an impending war with Bulgaria. On 24 April 1904, a group of pro–Romanian Aromanians submitted a petition to the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] demanding greater autonomy, including the administration of church service in the Aromanian language instead of Greek. The Patriarchate viewed the incident as a Romanian provocation, citing the fact that the translations of religious texts were not officially approved it declined the petition. In 1905, the two countries exchanged accusations regarding the Vlach Question. Romania claimed that Greek armed bands targeted ethnic Romanians in Macedonia, whereas Greece accused Romania of trying to create a false equation between Aromanians and Romanians.{{sfn|Sfetas|2001|pp=33–41}}

[[Hellenophobic]] articles began appearing in the Romanian press. On 2 August 1905, the Society of Macedono–Romanian Culture organized an anti–Greek protest in Bucharest, attended by army officers, students and Vlachs. After decrying Greek war crimes in Macedonia, the organizers called for a boycott of Greek products and services. Rioting was prevented by a large force of Romanian [[Gendarmerie (Romania)|gendarmerie]]. On the same day a Greek-owned cafe in Bucharest was vandalized and its owner beaten. Several days later three editors of the Greek-language newspaper ''Patris'' were expelled from the country for sedition. On 13 August, protesters burnt a [[Greek flag]] in [[Giurgiu]]. An official remonstrance by the Greek ambassador Tombazis was rebutted, leading to a mutual withdrawal of embassies on 15 September.{{sfn|Sfetas|2001|pp=41–47}}

In November, the Romanian government allocated funding for the creation of armed Aromanian bands in Macedonia, and in a parallel move closed numerous Greek schools in the country. In February 1906, six leading members of the Greek community were expelled from the country, citing their alleged funding of Greek bands in Macedonia. In July 1906, the Greek government officially cut diplomatic relations with Romania. In 1911, Greek prime minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] used the occasion of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] to improve relations with Bulgaria and Romania, restoring diplomatic relations with the latter. The [[Balkan League]], which included Bulgaria and Greece, defeated the Ottomans in the [[First Balkan War]]. The League broke at the conclusion of the war, with the former participants and Romania soundly defeating Bulgaria in the [[Second Balkan War]]. At the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)]], Romania supported Greek claims to [[Kavala]], whereas Venizelos granted concessions to the Aromanians. The Vlach Question which had already lost steam due to Romanian gains in north Bulgaria came to a conclusion. The Greco–Romanian alliance was further solidified  during [[World War I]] when both countries sided with the [[Triple Entente]].{{sfn|Sfetas|2001|pp=41–47}}

[[File:Balkans Animation 1800-2008.gif|thumb|{{centre|Balkans animation 1800–2008}}]]
In the aftermath of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]], Greece found itself to be in the midst of an internal political crisis. The situation exacerbated by the emergence of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in the north, [[Italian imperialism|Italian imperial ambitions]] in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the resurgence of Turkey as a regional power. The 1923 [[Corfu incident]] showcased the inability of the [[League of Nations]] to protect the interests of smaller countries such as Greece from the encroachments of Italy. In 1924, Yugoslavia unilaterally cancelled the [[Greek–Serbian Alliance of 1913]]. In the meantime irrevocable differences with Bulgaria prevented the two countries from normalizing relations. Romanian diplomats [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] and [[Nicolae Titulescu]] perceived the fact that Romania was surrounded by Slavic countries as a threat to its security. Thessaloniki's appeal as a potential artery for Romanian exports further increased the possibility of a Greco–Romanian alliance. In 1927, [[Alexandru Averescu]] and [[Andreas Michalakopoulos]] engaged in discussions regarding the conclusion of a non-aggression pact. Michalakopoulos agreed to the establishment of a railway line between the two countries, given that it would not be utilized for military purposes. That meant that Romania was to engage in a military confrontation against Bulgaria, shall the latter use the railway to deploy its military against Greece. Negotiations were temporarily halted as Romanian diplomats pondered on how to preserve a balance between their involvement with the French-led [[Little Entente]] and Italy which supported Romanian claims in [[Bessarabia]]. In January 1928, Titulescu secured [[Benito Mussolini]]'s approval for a Greco–Romanian treaty.{{sfn|Svolopoulos|1974|pp=151–155}}

==Treaty==
Negotiations with Greece resumed in March 1928, during a regular League of Nations conference in Geneva. The Greek–Romanian Non-Aggression and Arbitration Pact was signed by Michalakopoulos and Titulescu on 21 March. The two sides agreed to abstain from engaging each other in military confrontations, instead resolving their differences through diplomatic channels, according to the rules previously laid out by the League of Nations.
{{sfn|Svolopoulos|1974|pp=155–162}}

==Aftermath==
The pact effectively ended Greece's diplomatic isolation within the Balkan peninsula, strengthening its position on the negotiating table with Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Turkey. Venizelos' rejection of the Little Entente as a central European alliance alien to Greece paved the way for the Greco–Italian Treaty of 1928, which in turn led to diplomatic agreements with Yugoslavia and Turkey in 1929 and 1930 respectively. In 1931, Venizelos visits Bucharest to conclude the Greek–Romanian Trade and Shipping Agreement with his counterpart Nicolae Iorga.{{sfn|Svolopoulos|1974|pp=155–162}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3492">'''Law in action''' is a [[legal theory]], associated with [[legal realism]], that examines the role of [[law]], not just as it exists in the [[statute]]s and [[Case law|cases]], but as it is actually applied in [[society]]. Law in action [[scholar]]s often start with observations about the behavior of [[institution]]s and work "backwards" toward the legal philosophies guiding [[court]]s and traditional [[jurisprudence]]. As [[Kenneth B. Davis, Jr.]], Dean of the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]] has stated, "'Law in Action' . . . means that in teaching and research, no matter how interesting we find a legal theory, we always need to ask, 'How does this affect people's lives in the real world?'"

== History ==
The first reference to Law in Action may have been a 1910 article by [[Roscoe Pound]], the [[Harvard Law School]] dean whose work was a forerunner to the legal realism movement.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;[http://www.law.wisc.edu/law-in-action/davislawinactionessay.html Law in Action: The Dean's View - University of Wisconsin Law School&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; From there, the concept caught hold at the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]], where the law in action concept is most prevalent today. The law in action concept was a natural fit for Wisconsin because of its strong emphasis on the social sciences and the [[Wisconsin Idea]]—the concept that the boundaries of campus are the boundaries of the state.

== Teaching law in action ==

As at law schools everywhere, the focus is on appellate opinions. However, a professor who focuses on law in action is likely to go past the holding of the case to look at more questions such as "How might the parties on the losing end of the case respond?" "Will the rule change their future behavior?" "Who will enforce the rule?" or "What was the cause of the underlying dispute?" will be addressed &lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; Similarly, clinical education and clinical skills courses take on a more important role for students, who get to integrate their personal experiences with the classroom work.

{{Conflict of laws}}
The '''''lex loci arbitri''''' is the [[Latin]] term for "law of the place where [[arbitration]] is to take place" in the [[conflict of laws]]. Conflict is the branch of [[public law]] regulating all [[lawsuit]]s involving a "foreign" law element where a difference in result will occur depending on which laws are applied.

==Explanation==
When a case comes before a [[court]] and all the main features of the case are local, the court will apply the ''[[lex fori]]'', the prevailing municipal [[law]], to decide the case. But if there are "foreign" elements to the case, the forum court may be obliged under the conflict of laws system to consider:
*whether the forum court has [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case (see the problem of [[forum shopping]]);
*it must then [[characterisation (conflict)|characterise]] the issues, i.e. allocate the factual basis of the case to its relevant legal classes; and
*then apply the [[choice of law]] rules to decide which law is to be applied to each class.
The ''lex loci arbitri'' is an element in the choice of law rules applied to cases testing the validity of a [[contract (conflict)|contract]]. As an aspect of the [[public policy (law)|public policy]] of [[freedom of contract]], the [[party (law)|parties]] to an agreement are free to include a [[forum selection clause]] and/or a [[choice of law clause]] and, unless there is a lack of [[bona fides]], these clauses will be considered valid. If there is no express selection of a [[proper law]], the courts will usually take the nomination of a forum as a "connecting factor", i.e. a fact that links a case to a specific geographical location. For these purposes, one of the "forums" that may be selected is arbitration. Hence, the fact that the parties have chosen a [[Jurisdiction (area)|state]] as the place of arbitration is an indication that parties may have intended the local law to apply. This indication will be weighed alongside other connecting factors. The state that has the largest number of connecting factors will be the ''[[lex causae]]'' applied to resolve the dispute between the parties. If there is a tie, the connecting factors which relate to performance will be given a greater weighting.

The commission has the authority to determine whether to take action against the website or content intermediaries such as the internet service provider (ISP) or hosting provider.

Telefónica]] barring IP holders from demanding the identity of copyright infringers from ISPs.&lt;ref name = "EFF Bully" /&gt; There was strong international pressure, predominantly from the United States, for the creation of this legislation while it was strongly opposed by bloggers, journalists and tech professionals in Spain.&lt;ref name="EFF Bully" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC World" /&gt; Deputy Prime Minister [[Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría]] said that the aim of the law was "to safeguard intellectual property, boost our culture industries and protect the rights of owners, creators and others in the face of the lucrative plundering of illegal downloading sites."&lt;ref name = "BBC Ley Sinde"&gt;{{cite web |last = Unknown | title=Anti-internet piracy law adopted by Spanish government |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16391727 | publisher = BBC | date= January 3, 2012 | accessdate = February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative History==
The United States government has used the [[Special 301 Report]] to encourage other countries into adopting more stringent copyright and patent laws.&lt;ref name = "EFF 301"&gt;{{cite web | last=Hinze |first=Gwen | title=Shaping IP Laws by Not-So-Gentle Persuasion: The Special 301 Report |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/04/shaping-ip-laws-not-so-gentle-persuasion-special | publisher = EFF | date= April 21, 2010 | accessdate = February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cables unearthed by [[WikiLeaks]] suggest US pressure was a major factor in the creation of Ley Sinde.&lt;ref name="ArsTech"&gt;{{cite web | last=Anderson |first=Nate | title=How Wikileaks killed Spain's anti-P2P law |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/12/how-wikileaks-killed-spains-anti-p2p-law.ars | publisher = ArsTechnica | date= December 22, 2010 | accessdate = February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008 the US Embassy in Spain sent a cable back to Washington indicating they planned to tell the Spanish government that they would appear on the Watch List of the Special 301 Report if they did not take significant steps to reduce internet copyright infringements. The cable indicated that they would encourage the Spanish government to adopt a law similar to the two proposals that would eventually become France's [[HADOPI Law]] and the UK's [[Digital Economy Act 2010]].&lt;ref name= "EFF Bully" /&gt; The Spanish government did not show sufficient progress to satisfy the Office of the United States Trade Representative, and it was added to the 301 Special Report in 2008 and 2009.&lt;ref name = "EFF Bully" /&gt;

In November 2009 the Spanish government proposed a new copy protection law, the Sustainable Economy Bill, in order to address many copyright infringement issues across the nation. This bill included a provision, backed the Culture Minister at the time [[Ángeles González-Sinde]], that would eventually become what is known today as the Sinde Law.&lt;ref name= "EFF Bully" /&gt; This provision of this bill led to significant protests by the Spanish public and it was eventually stripped from the Bill on December 21, 2010 by The Committee of Economy and Finance in Spain's Congress as it engaged all users to agree.&lt;ref name = "EFF Bully" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "ArsTech"/&gt; With the failure of this provision, Spain was again added to the 301 Special Report in 2010.&lt;ref name = "EFF Bully" /&gt;

After being stripped from the Sustainable Economy Bill, politicians worked to revise Ley Sinde into a form that would be able to obtain passage through both the Congress and the Senate.&lt;ref name="El Pais Sinde 2.0"&gt;{{cite web | last=GARCÍA |first=ROCÍO | title=Una 'ley Sinde 2.0' para seducir al PP |url= http://elpais.com/diario/2010/12/29/cultura/1293577202_850215.html | publisher = El País | date= December 29, 2010 | accessdate = February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though still controversial, on January 25, 2011 the Senate passed this revised version of the law.&lt;ref name="El Pais Senate"&gt;{{cite web | last=Unknown | title=El 'acuerdo del Senado' enciende los ánimos en todos los sectores |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/acuerdo/Senado/enciende/animos/todos/sectores/elpepicul/20110125elpepucul_2/Tes | publisher = El País | date= January 25, 2011 | accessdate = February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress followed suit and passed the revised version of the law on February 15, 2011. This was the last step required before the regulations detailed in the law could be developed and the commission to review infringement claims established .

==Copyright Infringements in Spain==
Spain is considered by many to be the worst offender in Western Europe when it comes to internet copyright infrigments.&lt;ref name = "Pirates"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Williams | first = Wendy | title = Pirates of the Mediterranean| publisher = The Olive Press| date = January 28, 2012 | url = http://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2012/01/28/illegal-downloads-piracy-spain/ | page = 2| accessdate = February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 10 million CDs were sold as compared to 71 million in 2001, and digital sales have not replaced the lost CD sales. An executive at [[EMI]] Europe has been quoted as saying, "You can have a number-one album in Spain with 3,000 sales." &lt;ref name = "Pirates" /&gt; Since 2008, Spain has been placed on the US [[Special 301 Report]] Watch List, a list compiled by the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]]. The watch list identifies countries that the US feels do not have sufficient protection for copyright.&lt;ref name="EFF Ley Sinde" /&gt; The 2011 version of the report lists three Western European countries on the Watch List: Italy, Greece, and Spain.&lt;ref name="2011 301 Report"&gt;{{Cite web| title = 2011 Special 301 Report| publisher = Office of the United States Trade Representative| date = April 2011| url = http://www.ustr.gov/webfm_send/2841| page = 2| accessdate = February 12, 2012| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111017014642/http://www.ustr.gov/webfm_send/2841| archivedate = October 17, 2011| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by [[International Data Corporation]] (IDC) and commissioned by the Madrid-based Coalition of Content Creators and Industries, a group of copyright holders, examined the impact of copyright infringements in the first six months of 2010 on the Spanish economy. IDC claimed that 97.8% of all music consumption in Spain was from illegal downloads. During this same time period 77% of movie downloads and 60.7% of game downloads also took place illegally. IDC estimated this came at a cost of €5.2bn ($6.8bn USD, £4.3bn).&lt;ref name = "BBC Ley Sinde" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pirates" /&gt;

==Protests==

Ley Sinde continues to face strong opposition among the Spanish public as of February 2012.&lt;ref name = "BBC Ley Sinde" /&gt; Nine days after the first draft of the Sustainable Economy Act, a group of journalists, bloggers, professionals and creators drafted an anti-Sinde manifesto which was re-published by more than 50,000 blogs and websites.&lt;ref name = "Slashdot Spain's Internet Law"&gt;{{cite web | last=Unknown | title=Spain's Proposed Internet Law Sparks Protest, Change |url=http://yro.slashdot.org/story/09/12/04/038259/Spains-Proposed-Internet-Law-Sparks-Protest-Change| publisher=Slashdot | date=December 4, 2009 | accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web | last=Unknown | title=Manifesto in Defense of Fundamental Rights on the Internet | url=http://hiperactivo.com/2009/12/02/manifesto-in-defense-of-fundamental-rights-on-the-internet/ | publisher=Hiperactivo | date=December 2, 2009 | accessdate=March 21, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130125140923/http://hiperactivo.com/2009/12/02/manifesto-in-defense-of-fundamental-rights-on-the-internet/ | archivedate=January 25, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; FACUA-Consumers in Action, a Spanish, non-profit, [[non-governmental organization]], also launched an anti-Sinde campaign under the slogan: "nonprofit exchange of cultural works has always been a socially and morally accepted practice". FACUA gathered more than 40,000 signatures from their campaign.&lt;ref name = "FACUA"&gt;{{cite web | last=Unknown | title=Más de 40.000 ciudadanos firman el manifesto contra la Ley Sinde |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/cultura/20110119/54103327100/mas-de-40-000-ciudadanos-firman-el-manifesto-contra-la-ley-sinde.html| publisher =La Vanguardia| date=July 1, 2011 | accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been several protests regarding the law, including a few organized by the loose collective known as [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. One of the most publicized protests occurred at the [[Goya Awards]] (Spain's equivalent of the Academy Awards) in February 2011. Several hundred people, loosely organized by the Internet group Anonymous, showed up at the red carpet event wearing [[Guy Fawkes mask]]s and called for the resignation of Ángeles González-Sinde.&lt;ref name = "BBC Ley Sinde" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pirates" /&gt; Just after Ley Sinde was enacted in December 2011, individuals claiming affiliation with Anonymous also published private information about Spaniards thought to have supported the law. This included personal details like cell phone numbers, addresses, and, in the case of the González-Sinde, pictures of the front of her house. Individuals identified by the post reported receiving harassing phone calls and, in one instance, a death threat. With this release of personal information, the group also announced that further attacks would be upcoming at the 2012 Goya Awards.&lt;ref name = "El Pais Attack"&gt;{{cite web | last=Belinchon |first=Gregorio | title=Victims of "intolerable" internet attack denounce Anonymous|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/english/Victims/of/intolerable/internet/attack/denounce/Anonymous/elpepueng/20120201elpeng_4/Ten | publisher = El Pias | date= January 2, 2012 | accessdate = February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This threat was carried out in both real and cyber-space. Anonymous hackers took down the web page for the Goya awards on the day of the event.

'''''McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky''''', 545 U.S. 844 (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union|545|844|2005}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a case argued before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] on March 2, 2005. At issue was whether the Court should continue to inquire into the purpose behind a religious display and whether evaluation of the government's claim of secular purpose for the religious displays may take evolution into account under an [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]] analysis.

In a suit brought by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Kentucky, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] held that the displays—in this case, a [[Ten Commandments]] display at the [[McCreary County, Kentucky|McCreary County]] courthouse in [[Whitley City, Kentucky]] and a Ten Commandments display at the [[Pulaski County, Kentucky|Pulaski County]] courthouse—were unconstitutional.  The appeal from that decision, argued by [[Mathew Staver]] of [[Liberty Counsel]], urged reformulation or abandonment of the "''Lemon'' test" set forth in ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'', which has been applied to religious displays on government property and to other Establishment Clause issues.

The Supreme Court ruled on June 27, 2005, in a 5–4 decision, that the display was unconstitutional. The same day, the Court handed down another 5–4 decision in ''[[Van Orden v. Perry]]'' with the opposite outcome. The "[[swing vote]]" in the both cases was Justice [[Stephen Breyer]].

==History==
After two Kentucky Counties posted large and readily visible copies of the Ten Commandments in their courthouses, and a school district in a third county posted a similar display, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) sued. In response to the suit, and before the district court responded, both counties adopted similar resolutions that clarified the purposes of the displays as acknowledging "the precedent legal code upon which the civil and criminal codes of . . . Kentucky are founded."  The district court, following the ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' test, entered a [[preliminary injunction]] against the newly modified exhibits, finding that there was no secular purpose behind the inherently religious displays.&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/03-1693/opinion.html, pp. 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

After changing counsel, the Counties revised the exhibits again. The new posting, entitled "The Foundations of American Law and Government Display", consisted of nine framed documents of equal size. One set out the Commandments explicitly identified as the "[[King James Version of the Bible|King James Version]]", quoted them at greater length, and explained that they have profoundly influenced the formation of Western legal thought and the American Nation.  In addition to the Commandments, the counties added historical documents containing religious references as their sole common element.  The additional documents included framed copies of: the [[Magna Carta]], the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], the lyrics of the [[Star Spangled Banner]], the [[Mayflower Compact]], the National Motto, the Preamble to the [[Kentucky Constitution]], and a picture of [[Lady Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/03-1693/opinion.html, pp. 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

On the ACLU's motion, the district court included this third display in the preliminary injunction despite the counties' professed intent to show that the Commandments were part of the foundation of American Law and Government and to educate county citizens as to the documents. The court took proclaiming the Commandments' [[foundational value]] as a [[religious]], rather than [[secular]], purpose under ''[[Stone v. Graham]]'' and found that the counties' asserted educational goals crumbled upon an examination of this case's history.&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/03-1693/opinion.html, pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed the decision, stressing that, under ''Stone'', displaying the Commandments bespeaks a religious object unless the display is integrated with other material "so as to carry a secular message." The Sixth Circuit saw no integration because of a lack of a demonstrated analytical or historical connection between the Commandments and the other documents.&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/03-1693/opinion.html, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the court==

Justice [[David Souter]] wrote the opinion of the Court.  First, the Court reiterated its previous holding that the Commandments are "undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths" and that their display in public classrooms "violated the First Amendment's bar against establishment of religion."  Next, the Court noted that the [[Lemon Test]]'s "purpose prong" was rarely dispositive.  Nonetheless, it emphasized that that prong "serves an important function."  Indeed, anytime the government "acts with the ostensible and predominant purpose of advancing religion," or "to favor one religion over another," that advancement violates the Establishment Clause.&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/03-1693/opinion.html, pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the counties asked the Court to overrule the [[Lemon Test]] and, necessarily, the inquiry into governmental purpose, the Court refused to do so.  The Court noted that, in several areas of the law, an inquiry into the government's purpose is an important endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/03-1693/opinion.html, pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also stated that it was confident in the inquiry into purpose, because such inquiries had not yielded a finding of "a religious purpose dominant every time a case is filed."&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/03-1693/opinion.html, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

As to a second issue, whether the Court should consider the evolutionary purpose or the most recent purpose, the Court held that it should consider the evolutionary purpose of the display.  "But the world is not made brand new every morning, and the Counties are simply asking us to ignore perfectly probative evidence; they want an absentminded objective observer, not one presumed to be familiar with the history of the government's actions and competent to learn what history has to show."&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/03-1693/opinion.html, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court, reviewing the lower court's ruling ''[[De novo review|de novo]]'', upheld the lower courts' rulings, noting that a pastor was present to testify to the certainty of the existence of [[God]] at the dedication of one of the displays,&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/03-1693/opinion.html, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; the modified displays contained "theistic and Christian references,"&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/03-1693/opinion.html, pp. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; and there was a "religious purpose" in the final modification.&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/03-1693/opinion.html, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sandra Day O'Connor.jpg|thumb|200px|right| Justice Sandra Day O'Connor]]

Justice O'Connor expressed her own views of the controversy in a concurring opinion:

"It is true that many Americans find the Commandments in accord with their personal beliefs. But we do not count heads before enforcing the First Amendment . . .. Nor can we accept the theory that Americans who do not accept the Commandments' validity are outside the First Amendment's protections. There is no list of approved and disapproved beliefs appended to the First Amendment–and the Amendment's broad terms ("free exercise," "establishment," "religion") do not admit of such a cramped reading. It is true that the Framers lived at a time when our national religious diversity was neither as robust nor as well recognized as it is now. They may not have foreseen the variety of religions for which this Nation would eventually provide a home. They surely could not have predicted new religions, some of them born in this country. But they did know that line-drawing between religions is an enterprise that, once begun, has no logical stopping point. They worried that "the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions, may establish with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other Sects." Memorial 186. The Religion Clauses, as a result, protect adherents of all religions, as well as those who believe in no religion at all."&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/03-1693/concurrence.html, pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissenting opinion==

Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion, in which he argued that public acknowledgement of the God of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam is permissible under the First Amendment:

"Besides appealing to the demonstrably false principle that the government cannot favor religion over irreligion, today's opinion suggests that the posting of the Ten Commandments violates the principle that the government cannot favor one religion over another . . .. That is indeed a valid principle where public aid or assistance to religion is concerned, . . . or where the free exercise of religion is at issue, . . . but it necessarily applies in a more limited sense to public acknowledgment of the Creator. If religion in the public forum had to be entirely nondenominational, there could be no religion in the public forum at all. One cannot say the word "God," or "the Almighty," one cannot offer public supplication or thanksgiving, without contradicting the beliefs of some people that there are many gods, or that God or the gods pay no attention to human affairs. With respect to public acknowledgment of religious belief, it is entirely clear from our Nation's historical practices that the Establishment Clause permits this disregard of polytheists and believers in unconcerned deities, just as it permits the disregard of devout atheists.

"The three most popular religions in the United States, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam–which combined account for 97.7% of all believers–are monotheistic . . .. All of them, moreover (Islam included), believe that the Ten Commandments were given by God to Moses, and are divine prescriptions for a virtuous life . . .. Publicly honoring the Ten Commandments is thus indistinguishable, insofar as discriminating against other religions is concerned, from publicly honoring God. Both practices are recognized across such a broad and diverse range of the population–from Christians to Muslims–that they cannot be reasonably understood as a government endorsement of a particular religious viewpoint."&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/03-1693/dissent.html, pp. 9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent history==
In November 2010, counties in Kentucky filed a new appeal to the Supreme Court, requesting the allowance of the display once again.  The case was again titled ''McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky''.  The plaintiffs did not necessarily seek to "overrule" the decision in the original case.  Instead, they claimed that the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court]] had failed to follow the majority's comment allowing government to reform the reasoning of a display to render it constitutional.  The plaintiffs argued in their appeal that local government has given a firm secular reasoning for the display as the commemoration of historical documents and have renounced the religious motivation for the display, which was the court's reasoning for its prohibition.  On the other hand, the plaintiffs also argued for an overthrow of the [[Lemon test]], which indeed in that respect would have "overruled" the prior decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2010/11/ten-commandments-issue-again/|title=Ten Commandments issue — again : SCOTUSblog|date=November 4, 2010|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sixth Circuit Court did not discern any essential change from a religious to a secular motive for the plaintiffs' wish to display the Ten Commandments; and in February 2011, the Supreme Court without comment declined to review the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Richey |first=Warren |date=2011-02-22 |title=Supreme Court refuses appeal about Ten Commandments displays |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2011/0222/Supreme-Court-refuses-appeal-about-Ten-Commandments-displays |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |access-date=2015-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Military Readiness Enhancement Act''' was a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in several sessions between 2005 and 2009. It would have amended [[Title 10 of the United States Code|title 10, United States Code]] to include a policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, replacing the policy known as "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" (DADT), which banned [[Coming out|disclosing one's homosexuality]] while serving in the [[United States armed forces|Armed Forces]].  

The bill remained stalled in committee each time it was introduced. In 2010, its backers succeeded in [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010|repealing DADT]] effective September 2011, without establishing a nondiscrimination policy.

== Legislative history ==
Rep. [[Marty Meehan]] introduced the legislation in the [[109th United States Congress|109th]] on March 2, 2005, and [[110th United States Congress|110th]] Congress on March 28, 2007. Rep. [[Ellen Tauscher]] introduced it in the [[111th United States Congress|111th]] Congress on March 3, 2009. [[Patrick Murphy (Pennsylvania politician)|Patrick Murphy]] took over the sponsorship of the legislation after Tauscher's resignation in June 2009.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherman|first=Emily|title=Vet-turned-congressman: End 'don't ask, don't tell'|publisher=CNN|date=2009-07-09|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/07/08/murphy.gay.military/|accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 bill had 122 cosponsors and the 2007 bill had 149 cosponsors. They were both referred to the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Committee on Armed Services]] and the [[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel|Subcommittee on Military Personnel]] but failed to advance.

==Debate on DADT repeal==
{{Main|Don't ask, don't tell#Repeal|l1=Repeal of "Don't ask, don't tell"}}
Supporters of the repeal wanted Congress to eliminate the policy with the 2010 defense authorization bill in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Sunlen|author2=Davis, Teddy|title=Calls for Repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" - When Will the President Act?|publisher=ABC News|date=2009-03-02|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/03/calls-for-repea.html|accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, [[Patrick Murphy (Pennsylvania politician)|Patrick Murphy]] announced a "Voices of Honor" tour with the [[Human Rights Campaign]] to increase awareness of his non-discrimination bill.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; On October 16, 2009, [[The Hill (newspaper)|''The Hill'']] reported that Congressional leaders expected the repeal of DADT to pass in early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zimmermann|first=Eric|author2=Romm, Tony|title=Congressional leaders signaling move to repeal 'Don't ask, don't tell'|publisher=The Hill|date=2009-03-02|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/63511-congressional-leaders-signaling-move-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell-policy|accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]] stated that if passed by Congress, he would sign a bill repealing DADT.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; 

On March 3, 2010, Sen. [[Joseph Lieberman]] introduced the legislation, now called the Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2010, in the [[United States|Senate]] with original cosponsors including Democratic Sens. [[Carl Levin]] of Michigan, [[Mark Udall]] of Colorado, [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] of New York, [[Roland Burris]] of Illinois, [[Jeff Bingaman]] of New Mexico, [[Barbara Boxer]] of California, [[Ron Wyden]] of Oregon, [[Patrick Leahy]] of Vermont, [[Arlen Specter]] of Pennsylvania, [[Jeff Merkley]] of Oregon, and [[Dianne Feinstein]] of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eleveld|first=Kerry|title=Exclusive: Lieberman Details DADT Repeal Bill|publisher=The Advocate|date=2010-03-03|url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/03/03/Lieberman_Introduces_DADT_Repeal_Bill/|accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine more Senate Democrats announced their support on March 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garcia|first=Michelle|title=More Senators Backing DADT Repeal|publisher=The Advocate|date=2010-03-09|url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/03/09/More_Senators_Backing_DADT_Repeal/|accessdate=2010-03-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313154406/http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/03/09/More_Senators_Backing_DADT_Repeal/|archivedate=2010-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy introduced the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]], which eliminated the policy without prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, on December 10, and Sens. Lieberman and [[Susan Collins]] introduced it in the Senate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Keefe |first1=Ed |last2=Whitlock |first2=Craig |title=New bill introduced to end 'don't ask, don't tell'|newspaper=The Washington Post |date=December 11, 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/10/AR2010121007163.html |accessdate=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House passed it on a vote of 250 to 175 on December 15, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll638.xml |title=Final vote results for roll call 638 |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |date=December 15, 2010 |accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Senate passed it by a vote of 65–31 on December 18, 2010.&lt;ref name="NYTcong"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hulse|first=Carl|title=Senate Repeals 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 18, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/us/politics/19cong.html|accessdate=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Myanmar National Education Law''' ({{lang-my|အမျိုးသားပညာရေး ဥပဒေ}}), enacted on 30 September 2014, is designed to reform the country's outdated education system. Drafted in March 2014, the bill was passed after being sent back to the floor by [[President of Burma|President]] [[Thein Sein]] with 25 proposed changes, 19 of which were accepted. From the beginning of its drafting process, the law faced criticism from students and teachers unions as well as various civil society groups. Concerns over the law later turned into protests, which were eventually cracked down by the [[Government of Burma|government]].

==National Education Law 2014==

'''Section 1''' includes definition of terms used in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=1–5|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As laid out in '''Section 2''', the main objectives of the law are to train students to become critical thinkers; to nurture students to become law-abiding citizens with democratic principles; to enable students to become citizens who could pass down their ethnic languages, traditions, literature and to value historical heritage and environmental sustainability; to enhance human resources in preparation for economic development and higher standards of living; to provide a learning environment that is up to date with international standards and to improve teaching, learning and research by using technology information and communication information; to help students excel in their own fields of interest; and to promote sportsmanship and school health projects.&lt;ref name=NEL&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=5–6|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 3''' of the law covers the fundamental policies of the law that include providing education for students with disabilities; providing education relevant to the lives of the students; and granting autonomy of colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=6–7|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 4''' outlines the formation of National Education Commission that will consist of ministers from related sectors, experts from nationality groups and relevant individuals. The duties of the committee include providing guidelines on implementation of the objectives and the policies of the law; setting policies to ensure the quality of education; working with the government and local administration to get funding for the education sector; making policies regarding shutting down or opening of domestic as well as international schools; and working with relevant departments and ministries on short-term and long-term educational goals. Article 7 of the Section 4 also states that the commission should not interfere with the management of institutions of higher education but only assist with policy-related issues for their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=7–8|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 5''' states that public education will be divided into primary education, vocational education and higher education. The section also talks about formal and informal education as well as self-learning education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=9–12|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 6''' covers the different types of schools that include public schools, private schools, monastic schools, volunteer schools, regional schools, government-funded schools, special schools and emergency mobile schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=12–13|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 7''' is about curriculum and it states that National Education Commission has to ensure curriculums used in the country have boundaries and standards and guarantee autonomy of curriculum formations if it meets these standards. Ministry of Education will set the standards of National Education Curriculum with approval from the Commission. Schools can teach in either Burmese or English or both languages and if necessary, an ethnic language and Burmese can be used in primary education. It also mentions that in States and Regions, ethnic language and literature program can be implemented through state and regional governments starting from elementary level and upgraded step by step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=13–15|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 8''' details educational duties and benefits and explain the roles of parent(s) or guardian(s) and local and regional administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=15–16|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 9''' focuses on requirements for and quality of teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=16–17|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 10''' covers monitoring and accessing the education quality and states that in every level of education there must be a quality assessment scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=17|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 11''' is on management and administrative duties of education. In Article 56 (a), it states the Ministry of Education, relevant ministries and Higher Education Committee will work together to manage related institutions of higher education based on this law and existing laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=17–19|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 12''' covers budget&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=19–20|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Section 13''', Article 66 states that existing schools before the implementation of the law must operate according to the law by five years of its enactment.&lt;ref name="National Education Law"&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=20|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 14 covers more general issues including that the law does not govern schools that only teach religion.&lt;ref name="National Education Law"/&gt;

==Background==
In March 2014, Education Promotion and Implementation Committee (EPIC) drafted the National Education Bill,&lt;ref name="burma teachers chime"&gt;{{cite news|title=Burma's Teachers Chime in on Education Reform|url=http://www.dvb.no/news/burmas-teachers-chime-in-on-education-reform-burma-myanmar/44176|accessdate=21 February 2015|publisher=Democratic Voice of Burma|date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which went through both houses of [[Hluttaw]] on July 30, 2014.&lt;ref name="myanmar teachers' fed decry"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yen|first1=Snaing|title=Myanmar Teachers' Federation Decry Lack of Consulatation|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/teachers-federation-decries-lack-consultation-burmas-education-bill.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irawaddy Publishing Group|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the bill was waiting for the approval from President, students and teachers unions as well as the civil society groups raised concerns over whether the bill was drafted democratically . They claimed that even though the government held meetings to seek advice from the public, it ignored their recommendations.&lt;ref name="MTF joins students"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aung|first1=San Yamin|title=Teachers' and Students' Organizations Join Up to Oppose Education Bill|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/teachers-students-organizations-join-oppose-education-bill.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thein Sein sent back the bill to the parliament with some 25 proposed changes.  On September 26, the parliament accepted 19 of the proposed changes but denied 6 one of which is to delay the full implementation of the law to 2027&lt;ref name="students vow"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lwin|first1=Sithu|last2=Zaw|first2=Mg|title=Student unions vow to continue protests against education law|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/11994-student-unions-vow-to-%20continue-protests-against-education-law.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Myanmar Times|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it became enacted on September 30. The next step is for Hluttaw to pass by-laws in the coming months to supplement the enacted law.&lt;ref name="students seek four-party"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students Seek Four-Party Dialogue on Education Law|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/11994-student-unions-vow-to-%20continue-protests-against-education-law.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Opponents of the law claimed that the government didn't seek advice from the students adequately. They were also unsatisfied that minority ethnic languages would not be taught at institutes of higher education.&lt;ref name="students vow" /&gt; They also stated that under the new law, universities would not be independent from [[Ministry of Education (Burma)|Ministry of Education]]&lt;ref name="students to hold emergency meeting"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Min|first1=Myat|title=Myanmar students to hold emergency meeting over education law|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/13614-myanmar-students-to- hold-emergency-meeting-over-education-law|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Myanmar Times|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of all, they point out that the law will not recognize the formation of student and teacher unions.&lt;ref name="students seek four-party" /&gt;

On the other hand, members of Hluttaw responded that institutions of higher education would remain independent from central control. Khin Maung Yi, the secretary of the Joint Bill Committee, asserted that universities would have autonomy over creating their own policies. He also accused that protesters had "little understanding" of law.&lt;ref name="students vow" /&gt; [[Yin Yin Nwe]], a member of the President Education Advisory Group, remarked that complete decentralization of education would be impossible. The advisory group also stated that government committees that would be established as mentioned in the law were not designed to control universities but just to allocate budget.&lt;ref name="limits to how far"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Myint|first1=Nan|title=Limits to how far universities could be decentralized: gov't advisors|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/education/item/15009-limits-to-how-far- universities- could-be-decentralized-govt-advisers|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Myanmar Times|issue=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National League for Democracy]], the main opposition party led by [[Aung San Su Kyi]], was rather silent on the issue. In fact, the party distanced itself from the student protests stating explicitly that they would not follow National Network for Education Reform and did not endorse its criticism of the law (behind the student protests). Moreover, [[Phyo Min Thein]], one the NLD's [[Pyithu Hluttaw]] Representatives, said that the current law was "practical" given the political constraints.&lt;ref name="behind the student protests"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lone|first1=Wa|title=Behind the student protests|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/in-depth/12359-behind-the-student-protests.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Myanmar Times|date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main Opponents of the Law===

====National Network for Education Reform====
NNER is one of the most vocal opponents of the national education bill since its drafting stage. It is a coalition of civil society groups that include student unions, teacher unions, ethnic education groups, faith-based education groups, disabled education groups, community-based education groups, alternative education groups, education branches of political organisations, scholars and interested persons. It was formed in 2012 and had held several discussions across the country to seek opinions from the public on the current education reform process and in June 2013, it held a nationwide conference, attended by 1200 participants.&lt;ref name="students seek four-party" /&gt; During the drafting process of national education bill, NNER met with several government representatives and was even invited to meetings held in [[Naypyidaw]]. However, later it was left out from the discussion on the crafting of the bill.&lt;ref name="consider nothing"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thuzar|title='I Consider Nothing to Have Changed'|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/interview/consider-nothing-changed.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Student and Teacher Unions====
The two most eminent student unions involved in opposing the education law are [[All Burma Federation of Student Unions]] and Confederation of University Student Unions and Middle Myanmar Student Unions. These organizations are also the major force behind the student protests against the law.

MTF (Myanmar Teachers Federation), a nationwide teacher union, is also one of the major opponents of the bill. It released a statement on September 15, 2014 to publicly assert their position on the issue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We would like to announce to the people that we strongly believe that the National Education Law will affect not only the education sector but [also] the entire country and the people.  Therefore, the Myanmar Teachers Federation will fully cooperate with the student unions across the country who are pushing for the education reform that will benefit the country.&lt;ref name="burma teachers chime" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

In the same statement, MTF also criticized the government for investigating the students' protests against the law and called for the drop of criminal charges.&lt;ref name="MTF joins students" /&gt;

==Student Protests==

===''Initial Protest: May 2014 - Sept 2014''===
The earliest protests against the National Education Law came even before the passage of the bill. In [[Mandalay Region]], students at colleges and universities had held ongoing protests since May 2014. The protests were, however, postponed in early September due to upcoming exams but the students continued holding public talks to voice why they opposed the bill.&lt;ref name="MTF joins students" /&gt; Initially, protesters also linked their campaigns against the bill to the arrest of an ABFSU member, Phyu Hnin Htwe, charged for allegedly kidnapping two Chinese workers from [[Letpadaung Copper Mine]].&lt;ref name="students vow" /&gt; Government authorities also initiated criminal investigations against these protests based on the ground that they were held without prior government approval.&lt;ref name="students vow" /&gt;

===''Emergency Student Meeting: October – 13 Nov 2014''===

On 4 October 2014, three days after the law was enacted, an organizing committee was formed composed of 10 members of ABFSU and 10 members of CUSU. On 10 October, ABFSU announced that they would be holding an emergency meeting with student representatives from across the country in November.&lt;ref name="students to hold emergency meeting" /&gt; The plan was to have a two-day meeting to discuss about the National Education Law on the first day and then make plans on how to proceed on the next day.&lt;ref name="students to hold emergency meeting" /&gt; Later, the meeting was held in Yangon from November 12 to 13, which concluded with the formation of Action Committee for Democratic Education - 15-person group that consists of members of ABFSU, CUSU and MMSU - in charge of planning the four-day protest in Yangon.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students Protest Education Law in Rangoon|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-protest-education-law-downtown-rangoon.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Four-Day March: Nov 14–17 2014''===
[[File:Myanmar National Education Law Protests 1.jpg|thumb|Students protests at Yangon University]]
On November 14, about 350 students gathered in front of [[Maha Bandula Park]] in downtown [[Yangon]] to stage a protest against the National Education Law.&lt;ref name="behind the student protests" /&gt; The students also later held subsequent protests at [[Yangon University]] and [[Shwedagon Pagoda]].&lt;ref name="behind the student protests" /&gt; Moreover, Kyaw Ko Ko, the chairman of ABFSU, declared that the protest was just the beginning of the fight to reform National Education Law.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt; He also stated that the main concern against the NEL is the formation of a National Education Commission composed of ministers and government officials that could limit students' opinions and further reinforce the government control over higher education.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt; The protest also coincided with [[United States President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s second visit to [[Yangon]] although Kyaw Ko Ko claimed that it was not intentional.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt; He added, though, that the students would be ready to seize the opportunity to raise awareness about issues on education.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt; The Action Committee for Democratic Education then requested the government to convene a quadripartite meeting with its members, NNER, members of Parliament and the government to discuss the students' concerns.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt; On 17 November, the students announced a 60-day interval for the government to respond to their demands and also threatened that they would stage a nationwide protests if the government didn't respond within the deadline.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt;

===''60 day Ultimatum: Nov 18, 20 14– Jan 20, 2015''===

On November 18, a day after the students announced an ultimatum, Ministry of Education held a press conference, urging the students to attend a negotiating meeting with Education Promotion and Implementation Committee (EPIC), which drafted the legislation.&lt;ref name="limits to how far" /&gt; At the conference, Khin San Yee, the Minister of Education, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I want them to negotiate freely and transparently. Every parent cannot fulfill all of the demands of their children. So think of us like the parents and demand and negotiate with us and we will do. But if the parents can't afford it, the children should understand it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On November 20, President's Education Advisory Group held a meeting at the Diamond Jubliee Hall at Yangon University, to assert their stance on the current controversy over National Education Law. While acknowledging the voice of the students on the importance of decentralization of education, the group claims that there are limits to how independent universities could be. It further claims that the formation of National Education Committee is the solely on the purpose of budget allocation but not to centralize control over institutions of higher education.&lt;ref name="limits to how far" /&gt;

Zaw Htay, the Director General of [[Higher Education in Burma|Higher Education]] Department (Lower Myanmar) stated that negotiations were still open, after the students rejected a meeting with the ministry. He also said that students, parents and experts would be consulted in the process of crafting by-laws&lt;ref name="behind the student protests" /&gt; [[Shwe Mann]], the speaker of [[Pyidaungsu Hluttaw]], also agreed to accept written submissions to the parliament while EPIC also offered to serve as an intermediary.&lt;ref name="behind the student protests" /&gt; The students, however, announced that they had no intention to write submissions to the parliament because they were waiting for the quadripartite meeting.&lt;ref name="student protest ed law mandalay"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students to Protest Education Law in Mandalay|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-protest-education-law-mandalay.html|accessdate=26 November 2014|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, the Action Committee for Democratic Education announced that they were planning a seminar on National Education Law in mid-December and would invite experts unaffiliated with the government or the protesters. They also had plans to stage two more protests in the upcoming week and had held three in the previous week.&lt;ref name="student protest ed law mandalay" /&gt;

On November 27, about fifty students from [[Mandalay]], [[Sagaing]], [[Monywa]] and [[Myingyan]] staged an unauthorized protest in front of City Hall in Mandalay to reiterate their demand: to convene a quadripartite meeting.&lt;ref name="gov't neglect"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mann|first1=Zarni|title=Government Neglecting Student Demands Mandalay Protesters Say|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/govt-neglecting-student-demands-mandalay-protestors- say.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Myanmar Police Force|police]] at first stopped the students from exiting Eaindawyar Pagoda, their initial meeting point. The students, however, convinced the police that the officers' children themselves would benefit from the protests and were able to march to the City Hall and ended their protest at [[Mahamuni Buddha Temple]], a history significant place where 17 Burmese pro-independence leaders were killed during the colonial era.&lt;ref name="gov't neglect" /&gt;

On December 1, six students were threatened to get arrested for unauthorized protests that took place on November 29. They were told that they would be arrested for a day and then be eligible to be bailed out.&lt;ref name="6 students face"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mann|first1=Zarni|title=6 Students to Face Charge|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/6-students-face-charges-education-protest.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police left to inform the superiors and never returned after the students told them that they would not accept the release on bail but would rather get arrested.&lt;ref name="6 students face" /&gt; The six accused students, also the members of ABFSU, waited at [[Taungoo]] train station until 10 pm for the police to show up but then left.&lt;ref name="6 students face" /&gt;

On December 12, the Ministry of Education formed a teacher union consisting of two teachers from each department of Yangon [[University of Foreign Languages, Yangon|University of Foreign Languages]]. Myanmar Teachers Federation promptly rejected the ministry's attempt to form a union stating that it violated the internationally accepted principles of freedom of association.&lt;ref name="teacher rejects ministry"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snaing|first1=Yen|title=Teacher Federation Rejects Ministry Plans for Official Union|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/teachers-federation-rejects-ministry-plans-official- unions.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement released by MTF also said that the ministry failed to recognize MTF even though Burma had agreed to adhere to 1955 International Labor convention that guaranteed the formation of union and the right to organize and despite MTF's compliance with the current Burma's labor draft law.&lt;ref name="teacher rejects ministry" /&gt;

===''The 404-Mile March: Jan 16 – Jan 31 2015''===

After the 60-day ultimatum to convene a quadripartite expired on Jan 16, students from far afield as [[Pakokku]], [[Sagaing]] and [[Monywa]] set out to join the march from Mandalay to Yangon.&lt;ref name="students resume protests"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mann|first1=Zarni|title=Students Resume Protests Against National Education Law|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-resume-protests-national-education-law.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing House|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Jan 20, more than a hundred students left Mandalay as the march began.&lt;ref name="students resume protests" /&gt; The students also had plans to join other student protesters on their 404-mile journey to Yangon that they were planning to finish in 15 days.&lt;ref name="students resume protests" /&gt; They also said that they would set up a camp after arriving in Yangon to urge the government to consult with students and teachers on future amendments to the law.&lt;ref name="students resume protests" /&gt; 
Immediately after the march began, President [[Thein Sein]], announced in a state-run newspaper on Jan 21 that the parliament should reconsider some parts of the National Education Law and said that amendments would lead to stability and allow the students to resume their studies.&lt;ref name="prez urge"&gt;{{cite news|title=President urges education law rethink in face Mandalay March|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/education/item/17066-president-urges-%20education-law-%20rethink-in-face-mandalay-march|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=Mizzima|date=21 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, in a statement released by the parliament mentioned that it had agreed to consider changing the National Education Law and ordered the Ministry of Education to urgently come up with a draft that would incorporate inputs from both houses of the parliament, related government committees and commissions as well as relevant individuals.&lt;ref name="parliament presses"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Parliament Presses President on Six-Party Talks, Agrees to Revisit Education Law|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/parliament-presses-president-six-party-talks-agrees-revisit-education-law.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 24, ACDE released a statement that outlined the 11 issues that the students wanted to discuss at the quadripartite meeting:

:#Inclusion of representatives of teachers and students in legislation process of education policies and laws, by-laws and other related laws, 
:#The right to freely establish and operate student and teacher unions and legal recognition for them, 
:#Establishment of National Education Commission and University Coordination Committee mentioned in the approved National Education Law

On January 28, the student representatives and the government had a meeting in Naypyidaw – attended by ten student representatives, two members of parliament and Minister Aung Min as well as Deputy Education Minister Thant Shin.&lt;ref name="students march on" /&gt;  The government and the student leaders then released a joint statement announcing that they had agreed to stop the march to Yangon after the quadripartite meeting which would be held at the Diamond Jubilee Hall at [[Yangon University]] on February 1.&lt;ref name="students march on" /&gt; The statement also said that 11 demand-points from the students would also be discussed at the meeting on February 1. Meanwhile, the students declared that until they met with their representatives who went to Naypyidaw for the meeting, they would still continue the march.&lt;ref name="students march on" /&gt; On the other hand, the protesters in [[Pakokku]] and [[Dawei]] who were planning to join the march suspended their plans.&lt;ref name="students march on"&gt;{{cite news|title=Students march on, as talk date is agreed over Myanmar's education law|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/17294-students-march-on-as-talk-date-is-agreed-over-myanmar-s-education-law/17294-students-march-on-as-talk-date-is-agreed-over-myanmar-s-education-law|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=Mizzima News|date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Quadripartite Meetings: Feb 1–14, 2015''===

On February 1 as the quadripartite meeting was taking place, the NLD publicly announced that Thein Lwin, its central committee member and the chairman of National Network for Education Reform, did not represent the party or its policies.&lt;ref name="NLD distances" /&gt; It further mentioned in the statement that the NLD could take legal action against Thein Lwin for violating party rules regarding asking permission to participate in organizations independent of the party. [[Han Tha Myint]], a central committee member of the NLD, also stated that Aung San Suu Kyi, the chairman of the NLD, did not support Thein Lwin as his actions could be construed as representative of the party's stance on the issue.&lt;ref name="NLD distances"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mon|first1=Kyaw Su|title=NLD Distances Itself from Leading Voice on Education|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/nld-distances-leading-voice-education.html|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACDE promptly responded to that statement the next day by accusing the NLD for attempting to undermine the student protests at such a critical moment.&lt;ref name="NLD distances" /&gt;

The first quadripartite meeting ended with the students reaching an agreement concerning eight preconditions on further negotiations although the government denied the request to ensure security to demonstrators.&lt;ref name="protests continue"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Protests Continue as Students, Govt Discuss Education Reform|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/protests-continue-students-govt-discuss-education-reform.html|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing|date=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Aung Min]], a [[Office of the President of Burma|President's Office]] Minister, told the students that he would ask permission from the president the responsibility of the students' safety until they arrived in [[Mount Popa|Popa]] in [[Mandalay Region]].&lt;ref name="protests continue" /&gt; The first three preconditions from the students –issuing a public statement after every meeting, having information on education reforms available to the public, making sure all the parties involved in the meeting have equal opportunities to participate – were readily accepted while agreement on officially recognizing student and teacher unions was reached after four-hour long discussion albeit many details pending for further discussions.&lt;ref name="protests continue" /&gt; Furthermore, the meeting ended without any discussions on the eleven-point demands that the ACDE issued even though the students reached to an official agreement to continue the negotiations on February 3.&lt;ref name="protests continue" /&gt;

On February 3, in front of Ministry of Education headquarter in [[Naypyidaw]], the students announced that they would be resuming their nationwide protests.&lt;ref name="students vow action"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gyi|first1=Aung|title=Students vow action after govt delays talks|url=https://www.dvb.no/news/students-vow-action-after-govt-delays-talks-burma-myanmar/47968|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=Democratic Voice of Burma|publisher=DVB Multimedia Group|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that day, the government declared that the second quadripartite meeting was postponed after refusing to allow extra attendees who came along with the students to the meeting.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; During the meeting, Aung Min read out a letter, which he claimed to have just received from the president.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; The letter suggested that the meeting should be postponed and the government representatives decided to follow the president's advice after a discussion.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; That early afternoon, the [[Ministry of Information (Burma)|Ministry of Information]] released photos of government delegates standing in an empty room with a caption saying that the students did not show up to the meeting.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; Later that day, the government announced that the meeting would be postponed until February 12.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; The student leaders, meanwhile, declared that they have students ready to continue marching to Yangon from different parts of the country, including Mandalay in the north, Pathein in the southwest and Dawei in the south.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; On the same day, [[Aung San Su Kyi]] confirmed her opinions on the current protests, asking Thein Lwin to resign from his position in the central executive committee if he wanted to pursue his work with NNER.&lt;ref name="NLD resign" /&gt; Initially silent on the topic, U Thein Lwin said in a press conference on February 3 that he would accept NLD's decision.&lt;ref name="NLD resign"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lin|first1=Soe Than|title=NLD committee member must resign or cease education activism, says Suu Kyi|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/17456-nld-committee-member-%20must-%20resign-or-cease-education-activism-says-suu-kyi|agency=Mizzima News|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, the student demonstrators from [[Ayeyarwady Region]] have arrived near [[Kyaunggon]] after they received a welcoming reception from the town residents. About 800 people also temporarily joined the students marching from Mandalay on their way to [[Taungdwingyi]] after the leaders gave a speech at [[Magway University|Magwe]] Computer University. The students also planned to stay and protest in [[Pakokku]] for three days starting February 5 before they resumed their march to Yangon. At the same time, a committee representing about 260 civil society groups released a statement urging the government to continue quadripartite meetings and to refrain from the use of violence against student protestors.&lt;ref name="govt postpones"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=After Govt Postpones Education Talks, Students Continue March to Rangoon|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/govt-postpones-education-talks-students-continue-march-rangoon.html|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, it was confirmed that students from Ayeyarwady Region and [[Taninthayi Region]] had continued marching to Yangon to join other protesters.  That same day, the government announced that some political organization with intentions to destabilize the country were behind the student protests even though it did not identify them.

On February 7, [[Ko Ko (minister)|Ko Ko]], [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Burma)|Minister for Home Affairs]], said in the interview that some political extremists were manipulating students to use methods of confrontation and that in some cases, most of them were supported by foreign organizations.&lt;ref name="students are puppets" /&gt; Ye Yint Kyaw, a member of the ACDE, retaliated by accusing the government of having the same mentality as the former military regime.&lt;ref name="students are puppets"&gt;{{cite news|title=Students are puppets, says minister|url=https://www.dvb.no/news/students-are-puppets-says-minister-national-education-law-burma-myanmar/48103|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=Democratic Voice of Burma|publisher=DVB Multimedia Group|date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Post-quadripartite Meetings: Feb 15 – March 1, 2015''===

As the fourth quadripartite meeting on February 14 went without any issues, the student leaders and NNER began to craft the proposed amendment bill, which they finished on February 15.&lt;ref name="southern students" /&gt;  and the bill was submitted to the parliament on February 16.&lt;ref name="southern students" /&gt; Student groups from Ayeyarwady Region and [[Tanintharyi Region]] decided to suspend their march after hearing the result of the meeting. Student organizers also stated one of the reasons they decided to go back was because of [[Sitagu Sayadaw|Ashin Nyanisarra]], one of the most respected monks in [[Myanmar]], who told them to take pride in what they achieved and go back to continue their education for the future of the country.&lt;ref name="southern students" /&gt; In another statement, Ashin Nyanisarra told the government to forgive the students and to accept their demands.&lt;ref name="southern students" /&gt; Meanwhile, the main group of protesters from Mandalay continued to march from [[Minla]] to Letpadan in Bago Region and planned to arrive in Yangon in ten days &lt;ref name="southern students"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Southern Student Protests Disband, as Mandalay Marchers Press Ahead|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/southern-student-protests-disband-mandalay- marchers-press- ahead.html|accessdate=3 March 2014|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite announcement by the government the day before that it would be taking legal actions against the protesters if they continued their march to Yangon.&lt;ref name="minister threatens"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Linn|first1=Soe Than|title=Minister threatens legal action against protest students|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/17859-minister-threatens-legal-action-against-protest-students/17859-minister-threatens-legal-action-against-protest-students|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=Mizzima News|date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, the protesters from Ayeyarwaddy Region stalled their march and set up temporary camps in [[Maubin]] and [[Pathein]] Townships as they waited for the decision from the parliament while giving public talks on the latest updates on the agreements they had with the government and the content of the proposed amendment bill.&lt;ref name="ayeyarwaddy students build"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ayeyawady students build temporary protest camps|url=http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9081:ayeyawady-students-build-temporary-protest-camps&amp;catid=32&amp;Itemid=354|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Eleven Myanmar|publisher=Eleven Media Group|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day, Union Nationalities Alliance announced that they were in support of the student protests and donated $1000 while at the same time urging the parliament to quickly pass the amendments.&lt;ref name="parlament urged"&gt;{{cite news|title=Parliament urged to speedily approve national education bill|url=http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9087:parliament-urged-to-speedily-approve-national-education-bill&amp;catid=32&amp;Itemid=354|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Eleven Myanmar|publisher=Eleven Media Group|date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, some 30 students from [[Dagon University]] in Yangon staged a sit-in in front of the rector's office from 9:30 am to noon after they were unknowing invited to a campus event earlier that week that condemned the student protests.&lt;ref name="students stage sit-in"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students Stage Sit-In at Dagon University|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-stage-sit-dagon-university.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sit-in was also a response to the article featured in [[Kyemon|The Mirror]], a state-owned newspaper that claimed that students had organized the event by themselves.&lt;ref name="students stage sit-in" /&gt;

On February 20, the main column of student protesters from Mandalay announced that they would take a break from marching until March 1 due to primary and middle school exams coming up at the end of February.&lt;ref name="marching students pause"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Marching Student Protesters Pause for Exams|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/marching-student-protestors-pause-exams.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students also stated that they wanted to give time to the parliament and see how it would handle the amendment bill.&lt;ref name="marching students pause" /&gt;

On February 22, at a press conference in Yangon, the students accused the government for violating the agreements as the government submitted the Ministry of Education's version of the amendment bill alongside with the one agreed upon at the quadripartite meetings.&lt;ref name="gov't violates"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students, NGOs Say Govt Violates Agreement on Education Law Overhaul|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-ngos-say-govt-violates-agreement-education-law-overhaul.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that week on February 17, the Ministry of Education presented two proposed bills, claiming that the ministry crafted one of them.&lt;ref name="gov't violates" /&gt; The bill that the Ministry of Education proposed, according to Thein Lwin, the chairman of NNER, was the one presented at first at the quadripartite meeting but agreed to be discarded by the government.&lt;ref name="students meet speaker"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thu|first1=Mrat Kyaw|title=Students meet speaker as MPs ready for debate|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/13249-dispute-erupts-over-competing-education-law-amendment-bills.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Myanmar Times|date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competing drafts in the parliament might delay the process and could take up to a month according to Phyo Min Thein, a member of parliament representing the NLD.&lt;ref name="students meet speaker" /&gt;  Despite concerns from the students, the two proposed bills seemed to have some features in common. They both stated that schools and universities will be independent from the National Education Commission; that the school system would cater to students with disabilities; that the students would have the right to choose subjects they want to study except for those mandatory to pass the matriculation; that students and teachers would have the right to form unions and if necessary with financial help from university administration; that schools would be able to choose which language to teach; and that the government would increase the funding to 20% of the national budget in five years.&lt;ref name="students meet speaker" /&gt;

Meanwhile, on February 24, the [[Amyotha Hluttaw]] (the Upper House) invited six major groups of stakeholders - the NNER, the ACDE, some 20 political parties, relevant members of the public, civil society groups and individuals who submitted the suggestions to the parliament - on the current issue to attend public hearings between March 5 – 15.&lt;ref name="parliament invites"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noreen|first1=Naw|title=Parliament invites students for Edu Law briefing|url=https://www.dvb.no/news/parliament-invites-students-for-edu-law-briefing-burma-myanmar/48695|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Democratic Voice of Burma|publisher=DVB Media Group|date=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, the [[State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee]] (SSMNC) – a body of government-appointed monks in charge of regulating Buddhist monks in Burma – issued a statement to the parliament publicly accusing that the proposed amendment bill that recognized unions will result in confusion between religious and political issues, leading to the demise of the roots of Theravada Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="NSC rejects"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=National Sangha Committee Rejects Education Reform Demands|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/national-sangha-committee-rejects-education-reform-demands.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkar Moe Thu, a member of NNER, however, pointed out that according to Article 68(a), "schools that only teach religion are not governed by the law".&lt;ref name="NSC rejects" /&gt; Meanwhile, the students confirmed that they would continue marching on March 1, accusing the parliament for intentionally delaying the process of passing the amendment bill.&lt;ref name="NSC rejects" /&gt;

On February 25, in response to the accusation from the students, Khin Maung Yi, the chairperson of Joint Bill Committee, stated that the committee was not just buying time.&lt;ref name="bill committee"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill committee: Education law amendment will not meet student deadline|url=http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9153:bill-committee-education-law-amendment-will-not-meet-student-deadline&amp;catid=32:politics&amp;Itemid=354|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Eleven Myanmar|publisher=Eleven Media Group|date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that the committee was putting all necessary effort to finalize the bill in the current parliamentary session amidst other important bills such as the budget bill, the taxation bill and the national planning bill.&lt;ref name="bill committee" /&gt; Moreover, since the education bill is not under the category of bills that will go directly to the Union of Parliament, it has to go through the Lower House and the Upper House before it could be passed.&lt;ref name="bill committee" /&gt;

On February 27, the students met with Shwe Mann, the Speaker of the [[Pyidaungsu Hluttaw]] and the Joint Bill Committee to voice their concerns over the competing bills but they were told that the bills were already submitted to the parliament.&lt;ref name="students cry foul"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students Cry Foul Over Education Ministry Proposals|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-cry-foul-education-ministry-proposals.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanda Sit Aung, member of the ACDE, said that it was the violation of the quadripartite agreements because the bill that was submitted as the one proposed by students and the NNER was actually the one that everyone agreed at the quadripartite meeting.&lt;ref name="students cry foul" /&gt;
 
On March 2, as the students prepared to resume their march to Yangon from [[Letpadan Township|Letpadan]], the police surrounded the monastery where they were staying.&lt;ref name="myanmar prevents"&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar Prevents Students From Marching Against Academic Law|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/myanmar-prevents-student-protesters-marching-yangon-29316968|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ABC News|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students then agreed to delay their march and were joined by another group of students that pushed through a barricade of riot police.&lt;ref name="myanmar prevents" /&gt;

On March 3, a confrontation broke out between the student protesters and the police when a group of female students went to sit in front of the monks who were on hunger strike.&lt;ref name="students face off"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noreen|first1=Naw|title=Students face off against police in Letpadan|url=https://www.dvb.no/news/students-face-off-aginst-police-in-letpadan-burma-myanmar/48884|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Democratic Voice of Burma|publisher=DVB Multimedia Group|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police misinterpreted the move as the students attempting to push through the line and came charging toward the students.&lt;ref name="students face off" /&gt; The issue was later resolved when student leaders came to calm down the situation.&lt;ref name="students face off" /&gt; Earlier that day, students negotiated with Bago Region Border and Security Affairs Minister Col. Thet Htun who urged them to halt their march.&lt;ref name="students face off" /&gt; The students offered a compromise and stated that they would disperse in Yangon if the minister agreed on the eight-point conditions: to march to [[Tharrawaddy, Burma|Tharawaddy]], the nearest town; to fly banners and use megaphones after they embarked on vehicles to Yangon; and to have the police forces keep a distance from them.&lt;ref name="students face off" /&gt; However, they did not receive any response from the minister.&lt;ref name="students face off" /&gt;

On March 4, the students woke up to find that the government had reinforced the blockade with barbed wire.&lt;ref name="tension sparks"&gt;{{cite news|title=Letpadan tension sparks return to nationwide education protests|url=https://www.dvb.no/dvb-video/letpadan-tension-sparks-return-nationwide-education-protests/48943|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Democratic Voice of Burma|publisher=DVB Multimedia Group|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The riot police also stopped a group of student protesters who left [Pyay] to join the students in Letpadan.&lt;ref name="tension sparks" /&gt; The truck the students were on was checked on its way to Letpadan and was not allowed to continue.&lt;ref name="tension sparks" /&gt; A police officer said that they were ordered to stop the protesters and that the students should wait for the results of the negotiation scheduled for the next day.&lt;ref name="tension sparks" /&gt; Police Lt.

On March 6, all eight students were released but they were charged under Article 18 of Peaceful Assembly Law for organizing unlawful protest, which could result in up to one-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name="students activist alleged" /&gt; The same morning, another five student protesters near the town market in Letpadan were arrested and the Letpadan local police also announced that 11 people present at a rally two days earlier would  be charged under the same article used to arrest protesters in Yangon.&lt;ref name="students activist alleged" /&gt; There were also two rallies that day, one near the Yangon University campus and one at the entrance of Mandalay University campus to criticize the government's violent crackdown of the protests a day earlier in Yangon and to urge the government to let the students continue their march from Letpadan.&lt;ref name="rallies in ygn and man"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rallies in Rangoon, Mandalay to Condemn Police Crackdown|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/multimedia-burma/rallies-in-rangoon-mandalay-to-condemn-police-crackdown.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, the students after going a hunger strike since March 3 announced the deadline at 10 am on March 10, asking the government to bring an end to the standoff in Letpadan and to allow them to continue marching to Yangon.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scenes of Indiscriminate Violence in Letpadan as Police Attack Ambulance Workers, Students, Reporter|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/photo/scenes-of-indiscriminate-violence-in-letpadan-as-police-attack-ambulance-workers-students-reporter.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, as the deadline expired, the students began to remove the barbed wire set up by the police but their attempt was futile.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; After their second attempt an hour later, the police declared that the protest was illegal and ordered the students to evacuate the monastery five persons at a time and not to leave Yangon in one group.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; The students refused and turned themselves in for peaceful arrests.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; The police then initiated an assault on the protesters including those inside the monastery.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; The exact number of injured people was not confirmed but the estimate was around 100.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; The police also attacked on volunteers working to escort the injured.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; Zar Zar Tun from [[Free Funeral Service Society]], an organization in support of the movement from the beginning, announced that the first ambulance provided by the organization transported six men and two women one of whom suffered a severe head injury.

Several people were injured and initially one of the protesters was handcuffed but later released at the scene after the students plead and agreed to disband.&lt;ref name="rangoon student protest"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thuzar|title=Rangoon Student Protest Quashed Within Minutes|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/rangoon-student-protest-quashed-within-minutes.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Letpadan crackdown received criticism from the [[European Union]] as well as the NLD, which was not in support of the current student movement.

Ng Akew was a [[Tanka people|Tanka]] slave of the British opium smuggler [[James Bridget Endicott]] in Hong Kong, and seem to have been involved in his business. In 1849, he gave her a share of his cargo, which she sold along the coast from her own boats. When her boat and cargo was stolen by pirates, she traveled herself to the pirate base and negotiated compensation. Shortly after, an American ship was attacked and its cargo stolen by a pirate ship with Ng Akew present. The stolen cargo was later discovered in her own ship. It was assumed that she had negotiated with the pirates that the cargo from their next pirate attack would go to her as compensation for the cargo they stole from her. Her guilt could not be proven in court and she was therefore freed, but the case became famous in her time. 

When Bridget Endicott retired to Macao he provided her with land in Hong Kong, and she became a wealthy house owner.

The '''Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons''', Protocol IV of the 1980 [[Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons]], was issued by the United Nations on 13 October 1995.&lt;ref name=UNTreatyInfo /&gt; It came into force on 30 July 1998.&lt;ref name=UNTreatyInfo&gt;{{cite web|title=2 .a Additional Protocol to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects (Protocol IV, entitled Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons)|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVI-2-a&amp;chapter=26&amp;lang=en|website=United Nations Treaty Collection|accessdate=4 July 2014|date=7 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the end of April 2018, the protocol had been agreed to by 108 states.&lt;ref name=UNTreatyInfo /&gt;

==History==
The [[Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons]] and three annexed protocols were adopted on 10 October 1980 and opened for signature on 10 April 1981.&lt;ref name=ICRCProtocolInfo&gt;{{cite web|title=Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons (Protocol IV to the 1980 Convention), 13 October 1995|url=http://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Treaty.xsp?action=openDocument&amp;documentId=70D9427BB965B7CEC12563FB0061CFB2|website=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Sweden and Switzerland pushed for the Blinding Laser Protocol.&lt;ref name=ICRC1995Announcement /&gt; During 1989–91, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) held four international meetings of experts on the topic and in 1993 published ''Blinding Weapons''.&lt;ref name=ICRC1995Announcement /&gt;

==Protocol text==

===Article 1===
It is prohibited to employ [[laser]] weapons specifically designed, as their sole combat function or as one of their combat functions, to cause permanent blindness to unenhanced [[Visual perception|vision]], that is to the [[naked eye]] or to the eye with corrective [[eyesight]] devices. The High Contracting Parties shall not transfer such [[weapon]]s to any State or non-State entity.

===Article 2===
In the employment of laser systems, the High Contracting Parties shall take all feasible precautions to avoid the incidence of permanent blindness to unenhanced vision. Such precautions shall include training of their armed forces and other practical measures.

===Article 3===
Blinding as an incidental or collateral effect of the legitimate military employment of laser systems, including laser systems used against [[optical equipment]], is not covered by the prohibition of this [[Treaty#Protocols|Protocol]].

===Article 4===
For the purpose of this protocol "permanent blindness" means irreversible and uncorrectable loss of vision which is seriously disabling with no prospect of recovery. Serious disability is equivalent to visual acuity of less than 20/200 [[Snellen chart|Snellen]] measured using both eyes.

==Historical significance==
ICRC welcomed the ban on blinding lasers as "a significant breakthrough in international humanitarian law," adding:&lt;ref name=ICRC1995Announcement&gt;{{cite web|title=Vienna Diplomatic Conference Achieves New Prohibition on Blinding Laser Weapons and Deadlock on Landmines|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jmlc.htm|website=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=4 July 2014|date=13 Oct 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The prohibition, in advance, of the use of an abhorrent new weapon the production and proliferation of which appeared imminent is an historic step for humanity. It represents the first time since 1868, when the use of exploding bullets [[Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868|was banned]], that a weapon of military interest has been banned before its use on the battlefield and before a stream of victims gave visible proof of its tragic effects.}}

This was also the first international agreement regulating use of lasers during war.&lt;ref name=CarnahanRobertson1996 /&gt; (Use of lasers during peace had been previously mentioned in Article IV of the US-Soviet Union [[wikisource:Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities Agreement|Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities Agreement]] of 1989.)&lt;ref name=CarnahanRobertson1996&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Burrus M. Carnahan|author2=Marjorie Robertson|title=The Protocol on "Blinding Laser Weapons": A New Direction for International Humanitarian Law|journal=The American Journal of International Law|date=Jul 1996|volume=90|issue=3|pages=484–490|doi=10.2307/2204074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
The Protocol does not prohibit attacks against binoculars, periscopes, telescopes, and other optical equipment because it was unknown whether laser attacks on such devices could cause permanent blindness.&lt;ref name=CarnahanRobertson1996 /&gt; Article 3 allows for attacks on electronic optical equipment, because damaging it would not cause human injury.&lt;ref name=CarnahanRobertson1996 /&gt;

[[Ophthalmologist]] John Marshall argues that despite the Protocol's ban, countries continue to develop and use "[[rangefinders]], target illuminators, and anti-sensor systems" that "are still effectively antipersonnel laser weapons" because these technologies have the potential to be employed against people in addition to their intended uses. For example, "a laser system that will [[Dazzler (weapon)|dazzle]] at one mile away may permanently blind at closer range."&lt;ref name=Marshall1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=John|title=Blinding Laser Weapons: Still Available on the Battlefield|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|date=29 Nov 1997|volume=315|issue=7120|page=1392|doi=10.1136/bmj.315.7120.1392}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only way to prevent all possible eye injuries by combat lasers would be to ban such lasers,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} but the countries negotiating the Protocol saw this as neither feasible militarily nor even desirable from a humanitarian standpoint because target-marking and rangefinding lasers are important for keeping munitions on target and away from civilians.&lt;ref name=CarnahanRobertson1996 /&gt;

The '''Small Constitution of 1919''' was the first [[constitution]] of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. It was formally called the "Legislative [[Sejm]]'s ordinance of 20 February 1919, entrusting [[Józef Piłsudski]] with the further execution of the office of [[Naczelnik Państwa|Chief of State]]" (Polish: "''Uchwała Sejmu Ustawodawczego z dnia 20 lutego 1919 r. w sprawie powierzenia Józefowi Piłsudskiemu dalszego sprawowania urzędu Naczelnika Państwa''"). The legislation was published as ''Dz. Pr. P.P. Nr 19, poz. 226''.

== Provisions ==
The Small Constitution declared that Poland has a [[parliamentary system]], although it didn't define Poland as a republic.&lt;ref&gt;Ajnenkiel 1983, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Executive power]]s were held by the [[Naczelnik Państwa|Chief of State]]. He could name the ministers (with the consent of the ''Sejm''); he and the ministers were responsible before the ''Sejm''. The [[Naczelnik Państwa|Chief of State]] (previously the ''Provisional'' Chief of State) no longer had legislative initiative and could not dismiss the ''Sejm''; all his acts required the  signature of the relevant minister.

The Small Constitution was adopted and published on 20 February 1919 and went into effect a week later, on 27 February 1919. It was amended on 25 February 1920 and was supplanted on 1 June 1921 by the [[March Constitution (Poland)|March 1921 Constitution]].

[[File:Papa Ioannes Vicesimus Secundus.jpg|thumb|The issuer of the decretal, [[Pope John XXII]]]]
'''''Spondent Pariter''''' (sometimes referred to as '''''Spondent quas non exhibent'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloane|first= Thomas O'Conor|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01272b.htm|accessdate=4 August 2014|year=1907|location=[[New York City]]|chapter=Alchemy}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[papal]] [[decretal]] promulgated in 1317 by [[Pope John XXII]] forbidding the practice of [[alchemy]].&lt;ref name="supposed"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=James J.|date=October 1905|title=Pope John XXII and the Supposed Bull Forbidding Chemistry|journal=[[Medical Library and Historical Journal]]|volume=3|issue=4|pages=248–263|pmid=18340886|pmc=1692365}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale provided for the ban in the decretal is not a specifically [[theological]] one,&lt;ref name="Maxwell-Stuart2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maxwell-Stuart|first=P. G.|title=The Chemical Choir: A History of Alchemy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWeQI0AT6p0C|date=1 March 2012|publisher=[[A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=9781441132970|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead a moral condemnation, with the Pope expounding how fraudulent alchemists exploited the poor and charging them with knowingly engaging in falsehood.&lt;ref name="thealchemysite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.levity.com/alchemy/papaldcr.html|title=Pope John XXII's decree against alchemy|work=The Crime of Falsification.|accessdate=4 August 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RaBmzv04|archivedate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Calling it "The Crime of Falsification", the Pope specified that any person who either produced, successfully ordered the production of, assisted in the production of or knowingly sold false alchemic metals in attempt to pay off debt should be [[sentenced]] to pay a fine; the fine was to be calculated by weighing the alchemic metal and then charging however much that weight of real [[silver]] or [[gold]] would cost.&lt;ref name="thealchemysite" /&gt; Provisions were also made for those who could not afford to pay, the decree stated that other forms of punishment were allowed to be used, such as [[imprisonment]], but that the precise sentence depended on the surrounding factors of the case.&lt;ref name="thealchemysite" /&gt; Those who went on to use alchemic metals for the forging of coins were also condemned (one possible motivating factor for this inclusion being that the papacy was located in the [[Communes of France|French commune]] of [[Avignon]], which had a lot of counterfeit currency in circulation),&lt;ref name="Maxwell-Stuart2012" /&gt; but the harshest punishment was reserved for [[clerics]], who if found guilty, were to be subjected to the loss of all their clerical benefices and denied the chance to regain them in the future, in addition to the normal punishment detailed above.&lt;ref name="thealchemysite" /&gt; As a result of the decree, alchemists were forced to conduct their practice in secret.&lt;ref name = "white1893"&gt;{{cite journal |last = White |first = Andrew Dickson|title = New Chapters in the Warfare of Science. XVIII–From Magic to Chemistry and Physics |journal = Popular Science |volume = 42 |issue = 19 |pages = 289–302 |publisher = The Science Press |date = January 1893|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hyADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA297 |doi=10.5962/bhl.title.28634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decretal is frequently misunderstood to have been an [[anti-science]] (specifically an anti-[[chemistry]]) edict, but this is false – it was specifically against fraudulent alchemy.&lt;ref name="supposed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh2003"/&gt; Pope John XXII had himself studied chemistry before entering the clergy,&lt;ref name="supposed" /&gt; and his papacy was marked by events which led one historian to remark that he was "one of the most liberal patrons of education and of science in history.".&lt;ref name="Walsh2003"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/popessciencehist00walsrich | title=Popes and Science the History of the Papal Relations to Science During the Middle Ages and Down to Our Own Time | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | accessdate=4 August 2014 | last=Walsh | first=James J. | year=1908 | location=[[New York City|New York]] | pages=120–137 | isbn=9780766136465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Spondent Pariter'' is sometimes referred to as a [[papal bull]], though canonically it is not a bull but a less important document termed a decretal, specifically an [[Extravagantes]].&lt;ref name="Walsh2003" /&gt; It is listed in ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]'' Tome II (published in [[Lyons]], 1799), but not in the ordinary list of Pope John XXII's bulls.&lt;ref name="Walsh2003" /&gt;

The '''Stenotype Institute''' was an [[Acics|ACICS]] [[School accreditation|accredited]] [[private school|private]] [[stenotype|stenography]] school with two [[campuses]], one in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and one in [[Orlando, Florida]].  &lt;br /&gt;It was one of only 64 schools in North America certified by the [[National Court Reporters Association|NCRA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ncraonline.org/EducCertification/Schools/Certified/ | title=Certified Schools | author=[[National Court Reporters Association]] | date=2007-01-18 | publisher=[[National Court Reporters Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  

Both campuses offered day and evening classes and started new classes every two months.
They teach the Phoenix Theory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoenixtheory.com/ Phoenix Theory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; method of machine shorthand.

[[Image:Stenoicon3.jpg|thumb|Stenotype Institute of Jacksonville]]

== Jacksonville Campus ==
The school was founded in Jacksonville in 1940 by Thyra Ellis. The Jacksonville office was run by Carl McGowan who put it out of business. 

It was located three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) east of [[Downtown]] Jacksonville in a {{convert|16000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building, complete with a student lounge, 15 classrooms, a [[computer lab]], a [[library]], and an [[auditorium]].  The school closed its doors in March of 2015.

== Orlando Campus ==
Because of the continued success of the Jacksonville campus, Stenotype Institute opened a campus nearby [[Downtown Orlando]] in 2002.

The school occupied a {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building, complete with a student lounge, 12 [[classrooms]], a [[library]], an [[auditorium]], two [[computer lab]]s, and a [[gym]] with lockers.

The school closed its doors on September 30, 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2450">In law, '''telepossession''' is the right of ownership of a resource based on [[telepresence]] rather than physical proximity. The term gained importance in [[maritime salvage]] following the case of the [[SS Central America]]. In the case of the SS ''Central America'', the Columbus-American Discovery Group Inc. won over the insurer, [[Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company]]. This case was decided in the [[4th Circuit Court of Appeals]] in 1992. 

The basis for a claim of telepossession was the operation of ''robotic workers'' at the submerged site, where they performed the tasks of a manned crew of salvage workers. These telepossession robots worked to secure the site, provide for the management of the site, retrieve the gold from the shipwreck and other tasks. The [[common law]] principle of ''[[pedis possessio]]'' was relied on by the claimants to press their claim for ownership of the recovered gold. Pedis possesseo in layman's terms means "To walk on and to claim possession". This principle is the basis of the 1862 Homestead Act and the [[General Mining Act of 1872]] of the [[Congress of the United States]], which opened up the western United States for colonization and growth. 

Under the 1967 [[Moon Treaty]] of the United Nations, all property must be developed to the benefit of all humanity. Telepossession can provide for a form of possession which will allow mining and space colonization companies from all the worlds nations, as private entities, to develop the extraterrestrial resources used in making space stations, fleets of spacecraft, fueling stations, asteroid threat control, infrastructure and all other colonization infrastructures. See United Nations Treaties regarding space and Space Policy.

'''The People's Charter''' was a campaigning document in the [[United Kingdom]] devised by a commission of [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade unionists]] with the intention of uniting the [[British Left|left]] and providing an alternative to the [[neoliberal]] political agenda.&lt;ref name="Morning_Star"&gt;{{cite news | last = Richards | first = Andy | title = A people’s alternative | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120511023708/http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/index.php/news/content/view/full/90816 | archive-date = 11 May 2012 | url = http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/index.php/news/content/view/full/90816 | work = [[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]] | date = 26 May 2010 |access-date = 24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter demands public control of the banks, along with energy, water and transport, ensuring that there is investment in these services instead of money being creamed off to corporate shareholders. It also calls for a [[Progressive tax|fairer tax system]], with the wealthy and big business paying their way, investment not cuts in public services, the creation of millions of new homes, and sustainable jobs with decent wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The People's Charter for a fairer Scotland | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161129082623/http://www.unison-scotland.org.uk/peoplescharter/PeoplesCharter.pdf | archive-date = 29 November 2016 | url = http://www.unison-scotland.org.uk/peoplescharter/PeoplesCharter.pdf | publisher = Scottish Organising Committee for the People's Charter | year = 2009 | access-date = 28 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Points covered by the Charter==
Using the six demands of the ''[[People's Charter of 1838]]'' as a template,&lt;ref name="Morning_Star" /&gt; the demands of the People's Charter are:

# A fair economy for a fairer Britain
# More and better jobs
# Decent homes for all
# Save and improve our services
# Fairness and Justice
# A better future starts now

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2393">The '''theory of criminal justice''' is the branch of [[philosophy of law]] that deals with [[criminal justice]] and in particular [[punishment]]. The theory of criminal justice has deep connections to other areas of philosophy, such as [[political philosophy]] and [[ethics]], as well as to criminal justice in practice.

==Justice and criminal justice==

===Distinction from general justice===
Typically, legal theorists and philosophers consider four distinct kinds of justice: corrective justice, distributive justice, procedural justice, and retributive justice.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, The Problems of Jurisprudence. pp. 313-352&lt;/ref&gt; Corrective justice is the idea that liability rectifies the injustice one person inflicts upon another (found in modern day contract law).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weinrib|first=Ernest J.|date=2002|title=Corrective Justice in a Nutshell|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/825933|journal=The University of Toronto Law Journal|volume=52|issue=4|pages=349|doi=10.2307/825933|issn=0042-0220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distributive justice seeks to appropriately distribute pleasure and pain between the offender and the victim by punishing the offender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/863695610|title=Economic analysis of law|last=author.|first=Posner, Richard A.,|isbn=9781454833888|oclc=863695610}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Procedural justice]] focuses on the fairness in the processes that punish criminals. Retributive justice is perhaps best captured by the phrase ''lex talionis'' (the principle of "an [[eye for an eye]]"), which traces back to the book of Exodus.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 21:23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Criminal law generally falls under retributive justice, a theory of justice that considers proportionate punishment a morally acceptable response to crime. The principle of ''lex talionis'' received its most well known philosophical defense from Immanuel Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. (original 1785.) Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals. Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten. (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal law is no longer considered a purely retributive undertaking; deterrence figures prominently in the justification of the practice and in the rules themselves.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., H.L.A. Hart, Liberty and Morality (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Threatening government officials of the United States''' is a [[felony]] under [[Law of the United States|federal law]]. [[Threatening the President of the United States]] is a felony under {{usc|18|871}}, punishable by up to 5 years of imprisonment, that is investigated by the [[United States Secret Service]]. Threatening other officials is a Class C or D felony, usually carrying maximum penalties of 5 or 10 years under {{usc|18|875}}, {{usc|18|876}} and other statutes, that is investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. When national boundaries are transcended by such a threat, it is considered a [[terrorist threat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|18|2332b|a|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When a threat is made against a judge, it can be considered [[obstruction of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|1503}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threatening federal officials' family members is also a federal crime; in enacting the law, the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Committee on the Judiciary]] stated that "Clearly it is a proper Federal function to respond to terrorists and other criminals who seek to influence the making of Federal policies and interfere with the administration of justice by attacking close relatives of those entrusted with these tasks."&lt;ref name="From Archive.org-8554828"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/809/809.F2d.579.86-3085.html |title=UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee,v.James Edward GRAY, Defendant-Appellant.; No. 86-3085.; United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit. |work=bulk.resource.org |date=February 3, 1987 |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504155555/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/809/809.F2d.579.86-3085.html |archivedate=May 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three elements of the offense of making an illegal threat: (i) there must be a transmission in interstate commerce; (ii) there must be a communication containing the threat; (iii) and the threat must be a threat to injure the person of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=United States v. DeAndino|vol=958|reporter=F.2d|opinion=146|court=US Ct. App. 6th Cir.|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threats can also sometimes be punished under the statutes criminalizing [[assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain United States Government officers or employees]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=United States v. Heliczer|vol=373|reporter=F. 2d|opinion=241|court=Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit|date=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Assaulting, kidnapping, and assassinating the government officials of the United States|assassinating, kidnapping, and assaulting government officials of the United States]].

[[United States Sentencing Guidelines]] take a number of factors into consideration in determining the recommended penalty, including evidence of the person's intent to carry out the threat; disruption to the government function; and the possibility of inciting others to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=U.S.S.G. §2A6.1|url=http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/2a6_1.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618204634/http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/2a6_1.htm|archivedate=2010-06-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a 6-level [[official victim]] enhancement, which makes the recommended penalty, per the [[sentencing table]], approximately double that which would apply if an ordinary citizen were the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/3a1_2.htm|title=U.S.S.G. §3A1.2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618140656/http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/3a1_2.htm|archivedate=2010-06-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be many motives for making threats, including political motives or a desire to frame someone else for making the threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_14495305|title=Community College of Aurora librarian charged in mail threats|author1=Howard Pankratz  |author2=Joey Bunch |lastauthoramp=yes |work=The Denver Post|date=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person's intent can greatly affect the sentence.

In determining what constitutes a [[true threat]], the courts hold that what must be proved is that a reasonable recipient of the communication would consider it a threat under the circumstances. Thus, a statement to a judge that "You and your family are going to die" would be regarded as a true threat, even if the defendant claimed that he meant it as a literal, biological truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|volume=443|reporter=F3d|court=10th Cir.|opinion=1310|date=2006|litigants=United States v. Teague|url=http://openjurist.org/443/f3d/1310/united-states-v-teague}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a threat is made to multiple individuals, it may be considered to be outside of the guidelines heartland, and therefore to warrant an enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|volume=168|reporter=F.3d|opinion=84|url=http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/168/84/569079/|litigants=United States of America, Appellee, v.

{{main|Threatening the President of the United States}}
The Secret Service prefers not to publicize incidents of Presidential assassination threats, because it believes that it will generate more criminal behavior, especially among the mentally ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/65mcrm.htm#9-65.140|title=U.S. Attorneys' Manual|chapter=9-65.140 Publicity Concerning Threats Against Government Officials}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports have circulated in the British press that [[Barack Obama]] received four times as many threats as his predecessor,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Barack Obama faces 30 death threats a day, stretching US Secret Service|date=3 Aug 2009|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/5967942/Barack-Obama-faces-30-death-threats-a-day-stretching-US-Secret-Service.html | location=London | first=Toby | last=Harnden}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim that Secret Service Director [[Mark J.

===Legislators===
There have been comparatively few physical assaults on [[Members of Congress]]. On May 22, 1856, Senator [[Charles Sumner]] was savagely beaten down to the floor of the Senate chamber with a gold-knobbed cane by Representative [[Preston Brooks]] after Sumner delivered a fiery oration against [[slavery]]. &lt;ref name="US Senate Brooks"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/The_Caning_of_Senator_Charles_Sumner.htm |title=U.S. Senate: The Caning of Senator Charles Sumner |website=www.senate.gov |access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, four [[Puerto Rican nationalist]]s opened fire on the House chamber, wounding five Members of Congress.&lt;ref name=Cleveland/&gt; Representative [[Gabrielle Giffords]] was shot and severely injured on January 2011 outside a supermarket where she met with constituents. &lt;ref name="NYT_giffords"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/us/politics/09giffords.html |title=Representative Gabrielle Giffords and 18 Shot Near Tucson |last=Herszenhorn |first=Marc Lacey and David M. |language=en |access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representative [[Steve Scalise]] was gravely wounded in 2017 when he was shot by a former volunteer for [[Bernie Sanders]]'s 2016 Presidential campaign. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/us/steve-scalise-congress-shot-alexandria-virginia.html |title=Congressman Steve Scalise Gravely Wounded in Alexandria Baseball Field Ambush |language=en |access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Senator [[Rand Paul]] suffered several rib fractures and developed pneumonia after a November 2017 attack by a neighbor over a dispute over lawn care. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/politics/rand-paul-attack.html |title=Rand Paul’s Neighbor Is Sentenced to 30 Days in Prison After Attack |language=en |access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Threats and intimidation directed against Members of Congress are more common than physical assaults. A prominent example was [[cross burning|the burning of a cross, an intimidation tactic of]] the [[Ku Klux Klan]], on [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Sam Rayburn]]'s front lawn in Texas during debate on [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|civil rights legislation]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Cleveland&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2010/03/congress_members_reveal_more_d.html|title=Congress members reveal more details about threats|date=March 26, 2010|agency=Associated Press|author1=Kellman, Laurie  |author2=Abrams, Jim |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Capital Police]] investigates threats against Members of Congress and reports to the Chair and Ranking Member of the [[Committee on House Administration]] and/or the [[United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration]].

Social media have been used to publish threats and intimidating messages. Threats have been made through [[YouTube]] videos &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0410/35501.html|title=Man arrested for Nancy Pelosi threats|work=Politico|author=Sherman, Jake|date=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Twitter]] (which hosted direct threats of violence against Members of Congress such as Representative [[Bob Goodlatte]], and Senators [[Roy Blunt]] and [[John Hoeven]]). Concern has been voiced in the press over Twitter's failure in some cases to promptly remove threats made against Members of Congress.  Kyler Schmitz's threats to shoot Senator Roy Blunt remained on Twitter after Schmitz had been arrested for illegally using interstate communications to make the threat. &lt;ref name="TheHill_Twitter"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://thehill.com/policy/technology/285161-twitter-fails-to-take-down-death-threats-to-gop-senators |title=Death threats against senators remained on Twitter for 2 weeks |last=Swanson |first=Ian |date=2016-06-28 |website=TheHill |language=en |access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Michael McGowan was arrested in April 2018 for a series of [[Twitter#Tweets|Tweets]] threatening Representative Goodlatte and other lawmakers made from January to April 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/virginia-man-arrested-threatening-congressman-article-1.3919799 |title=Virginia man arrested for making repeated threats against Republican congressman  - NY Daily News |last=Chia |first=Jessica |website=nydailynews.com |language=en-US |access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter's stated policy on "Violent threats and glorification of violence" says "You may not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people". &lt;ref name="twitterpolicy"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/violent-threats-glorification |title=Violent threats and glorification of violence |language=en |access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2010 legislation for [[health care reform in the United States]] saw an increased number of threatening communications and actions directed at legislators. Several Members of Congress received threatening messages. Representative [[Eric Cantor]] received a threat from Norman Leboon, a donor to Barack Obama who had produced more than 2,000 threatening YouTube videos;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/03/29/cantor.threat.arrest/index.html?hpt=T2 | work=CNN | title=Man accused of making threats against Cantor | date=March 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Democratic Party said that it would donate the funds to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Brien |first=Michael |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/89667-dnc-will-give-cantor-threat-suspects-donations-to-charity |title=DNC will give Cantor threat suspect's donations to charity - The Hill's Blog Briefing Room |publisher=Thehill.com |date=2010-03-29 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other lawmakers' windows were broken with bricks and other objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/03/24/fbi-investigates-possible-threats-directed-house-democrats/|title=FBI Probes Threats Directed at House Democrats|publisher=Fox News|date=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[House Minority Leader]] [[John Boehner]] stated, "Violence and threats are unacceptable. Yes, I know there is anger, but let's take that anger, and go out and register people to vote, go volunteer on a political campaign, and let's do it the right way."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB20001424052748704094104575143782325623718|title=Parties Exchange Barbs Over Threat Reports|date=March 26, 2010|author1=Bendavid, Naftali  |author2=Johnson, Fawn |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rep.  Cantor, who received a bullet through his campaign office window, stated, "Security threats against members of Congress are not a partisan issue, and they should never be treated that way. To use such threats as political weapons is reprehensible."&lt;ref name="USAToday_Cantor"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2010-03-25-threats_N.htm|title=House leaders decry threats, dish out blame|author=Kelley, Matt|work=USA Today|date=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accused Representative [[Chris Van Hollen]] of "dangerously fanning the flames by suggesting that these incidents be used as a political weapon."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://congress.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/03/27/words-have-power/|title=Words Have Power|author=Pergram, Chad|date=2010-03-27|publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] remarked, "I think it is astounding that we are seeing this wave of [[vigilantism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ieYu07gp70-7oDIgoUOqgoWq4GtQD9ELGOOG3|title=Dems deal with threats over health care support|author=Pettus, Emily Wagster|agency=Associated Press|date=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the 2016 Presidential election, personal attacks gained a more prominent place in dialogue between the President and legislators from both major US parties, with at least one Member of Congress advocating harassment of other Federal officials outside of work.  In June 2018, Representative [[Maxine Waters]], speaking at an outdoor rally said, "If you see anybody from that (Trump) Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere." &lt;ref name="NPR_waters"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/06/25/623206039/congressional-leaders-criticize-maxine-waters-for-urging-confrontation |title=Congressional Leaders Criticize Maxine Waters For Urging Confrontation |website=NPR.org |language=en |access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2018, Senate Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] was confronted with shouted personal insults and the threat "we know where you live" by a crowd of protesters; earlier, McConnell and his wife [[Elaine Chao]] were subjected to verbal abuse by a crowd as they left an event at Georgetown University. &lt;ref name="CNN_McConnell"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/08/politics/mitch-mcconnell-louisville-protest/index.html |title=McConnell chased from KY restaurant by protesters |last=CNN |first=Devan Cole, |website=CNN |access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to National Public Radio, at least three Trump administration officials — [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] [[Kirstjen Nielsen]], Trump adviser [[Stephen Miller (political advisor)|Stephen Miller]] and White House Press Secretary [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]], along with her family — have been forced out by vocal protesters from restaurants or denied service. &lt;ref name="NPR_waters" /&gt;  

While Senate Minority Leader [[Charles Schumer]] and House Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] denounced the tactic of harassing their political enemies.  Both Schumer and Pelosi referred to President Trump's personal attacks on political opponents on [[Twitter]] while disavowing the tactics of Rep. Maxine Waters. &lt;ref name="NPR_waters" /&gt; 

During Senate confirmation hearings on [[Brett Kavanaugh]]'s appointment to the US Supreme Court, Senator [[Ted Cruz]]'s Houston campaign office received an envelope containing white powder just after two envelopes containing the poison [[ricin]] were mailed to US [[Secretary of Defense]] [[James Mattis]] and the [[Chief of Naval Operations]]. &lt;ref name="cruz_whitepowder"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2018/10/02/white-powder-mailed-to-ted-cruzs-office/ |title=White powder mailed to Ted Cruz’s office |date=2018-10-02 |website=New York Post |language=en-US |access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sen. Cruz and his wife also had to leave their table at a Washington restaurant when protesters shouted them down at their table. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/25/politics/ted-cruz-heckled-restaurant-brett-kavanaugh/index.html |title=Ted Cruz forced from restaurant amid Kavanaugh drama |last=CNN |first=Devan Cole, |website=CNN |access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to ''[[Newsweek]]'', Senator Susan Collins's office received "threatening, profanity-laced phone calls and letters, telling her to vote against the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court". One caller told a young woman working for Collins that he hoped she would be raped and impregnated, according to a voicemail provided to the ''[[New York Times]]'' by Collins's spokeswoman. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.newsweek.com/brett-kavanaugh-susan-collins-threats-1118121 |title=Staffers of Maine GOP Senator Susan Collins are receiving threatening and vulgar calls over Brett Kavanaugh. |date=2018-09-12 |website=Newsweek |language=en |access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Doxing]] of legislators also occurs.  Jackson A. Cosko, a member of Representative [[Sheila Jackson Lee]]'s staff, was arrested by US Capitol Police in October 2018, charged with public restricted information, unauthorized access of a government computer, burglary, threatening Federal officials and other crimes. &lt;ref name="Chronicle Cosko"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/article/Sheila-Jackson-Lee-intern-arrested-for-doxing-13279983.php |title=Sheila Jackson Lee intern accused of 'doxing' GOP senators in Kavanaugh battle |date=2018-10-04 |website=HoustonChronicle.com |language=en-US |access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a Federal arrest warrant filed by Capitol Police, Cosko threatened an aide of Senator [[Maggie Hassan]] who found him using a computer in Sen. Hassan's office, then ordered him to leave in an E-mail: "“If you tell anyone I will leak it all. Emails signal conversations gmails. Senators children’s health information and socials...” Mr. Cosko posted confidential personal information such as home and office addresses and home telephone numbers of five US senators, including Senate Judiciary Committee members [[Lindsey Graham]], [[Mike Lee (American politician)|Mike Lee]] and [[Orrin Hatch]], to their [[Wikipedia]] articles. &lt;ref name="WaPo_Cosko"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/democratic-ex-staffer-contests-charges-he-posted-personal-data-on-gop-senators-threatened-witness-in-doxing/2018/10/04/88842844-c806-11e8-b2b5-79270f9cce17_story.html |title=Democratic ex-staffer contests charges he posted personal data on GOP senators, threatened witness in doxing |website=Washington Post |language=en |access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyberstalking]] of legislators is a related problem. Juan McCullum, a former member of Congressional delegate [[Stacey Plaskett]] and Representative [[Frederica Wilson]] was charged in July 2017 with illegally obtaining private nude photographs of Delegate Plaskett and videos of her family from Ms. Plaskett's [[iPhone]] while he worked for her, then using an Internet account under an assumed name to distribute the photos and encourage other Internet users to share them online. &lt;ref name="WaPo_McCullum"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/two-former-staffers-charged-in-cyberstalking-of-us-house-member-husband/2017/07/13/535e2038-680e-11e7-a1d7-9a32c91c6f40_story.html |title=Two former staffers charged in cyberstalking of U.S. House member, husband |access-date=2018-10-08 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judges and prosecutors===
Threats against federal judges can include threats of [[vigilantism]]. For instance, in 2004, gun-rights activist, Denver businessman and former Libertarian candidate for U.S. Senate Rick Stanley was sentenced to six years of imprisonment for sending two judges, Thornton Municipal Judge Charles J. Rose and 17th Judicial District Judge Donald W. Marshall, Jr., a "notice of order" demanding that they reverse his conviction for a weapons violation or face arrest by Stanley's Mutual Defense Pact Militia and a trial for [[treason]]. Stanley was also ordered to pay $8,250 restitution to police who worked overtime to protect the judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Julie Poppen|work=Rocky Mountain News|date=September 11, 2004|title=Six-year prison term for gun-rights activist: Threats to judges called 'an assault' on justice system}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Threats against federal judges and prosecutors have more than doubled in recent years, with threats against federal prosecutors rising from 116 to 250 from 2003 to 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mainjustice.com/2010/01/04/threats-against-federal-prosecutors-increased-during-2000s/|title=Threats Against Federal Prosecutors Increased During 2000s|author=Andrew Ramonas|date=January 4, 2010|publisher=Main Justice|access-date=2010-03-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717003404/http://www.mainjustice.com/2010/01/04/threats-against-federal-prosecutors-increased-during-2000s/#|archive-date=2011-07-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and threats against federal judges climbing from 500 to 1,278 in that same period,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/05/29/Threats-against-federal-judges-increase/UPI-65931243638685/|title=Threats against federal judges increase|date=May 29, 2009|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem has become so pronounced that a threat management center has been opened in [[Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia]], where a staff of about 25 marshals and analysts monitor a 24-hour number for reporting threats, use sophisticated [[Geographic information system|mapping software]] to track those being threatened and tap into a classified database linked to the FBI and [[CIA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/24/AR2009052402931.html|title=Threats to Judges, Prosecutors Soaring|date=May 25, 2009|work=The Washington Post|author=Markon, Jerry}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a [[radio host]] was indicted for, after criticizing three [[appellate judge]]s of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] who affirmed a lower court decision to dismiss challenges to Chicago's [[handgun ban]] as "cunning, ruthless, untrustworthy, disloyal, unpatriotic, deceitful scum", allegedly saying, "Let me be the first to say this plainly: These judges deserve to be killed."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2009/07/radio-host-denies-threatening-federal-judges.html|title=Radio host denies threatening federal judges|date=July 28, 2009|work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also allegedly posted blog entries providing a photo and a map of the [[Dirksen Federal Building]] in Chicago, where the court is located, with arrows pointing to "anti-[[truck bomb]] barriers."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202435781035|title=Trial Over Death Threats  Against Federal Judges Could Test Free Speech Rules Online|work=National Law Journal|date=November 24, 2009|author=Lynne Marek}}&lt;/ref&gt; That case resulted in two [[hung juries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/mistrial-number-2-for-blogger-accused-of-threatening-federal-judges-2010-3|title=Mistrial Number 2 For Blogger Accused Of Threatening Federal Judges|author=Erin Geiger Smith|date=Mar 11, 2010|work=Business Insider Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sending of white powder as part of a threatening communication has become common since the [[2001 anthrax attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ktiv.com/Global/story.asp?S=12185086|title=Man sentenced for threatening Neb. federal judge|date=March 22, 2010|agency=Associated Press}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The making of these threats coincided with high-profile violence against federal officials in that same period, including Baltimore Assistant U.S. Attorney [[Jonathan Luna]], who was stabbed 36 times with his own penknife and drowned in a creek, and [[Thomas C. Wales]], an assistant U.S. attorney in Seattle gunned down at his home. Such incidents lead U.S. officials to take threats seriously. However, actual attacks on government officials are still rare in the U.S. relative to many countries with more unstable governments (e.g. so-called "[[banana republic]]s" that frequently experience [[coup]]s and assassinations) as evidenced by the fact that the most famous judge to be assassinated in recent times was [[John H. Wood, Jr.]] back in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20031214fedthreats1214p3.asp|title=Threats part of landscape for prosecutors|date=December 14, 2003|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|author=Torsten Ove}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Case law records that many threats are made from prisoners dissatisfied with the handling of their own case or fellow inmates', or wanting to serve time in the federal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/nebraska/article_077b07b0-3609-11df-84af-001cc4c03286.html|title=

Federal officials attribute the rising threat rate to disgruntled defendants, terrorism and gang cases that bring more violent offenders into federal courts, frustration over the [[Great Recession|economic crisis]] and the rise of the "[[sovereign citizen]]" movement &amp;ndash; a loose collection of [[tax protester]]s, [[white supremacist]]s and others who don't respect federal authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/09/AR2009060903669.html|title=Guarding the Halls of Justice Against an Escalating Threat|author=Jerry Markon|date=June 11, 2009|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media has become notable in threats against high-profile Federal judges. Several threats or encouragements of others to kill [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] judge [[Brett Kavanaugh]] or members of the Senate who supported confirmation of his appointment to the [[US Supreme Court]] were made on [[Twitter]].  Twitter formally forbids users to "make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people". &lt;ref name="twitterpolicy" /&gt; &lt;ref name="Rosemount_threat"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/rosemount-teacher-suspended-for-tweet-threatening-brett-kavanaugh |title=Rosemount teacher suspended for Brett Kavanaugh threat tweet |website=Bring Me The News |language=en |access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="MHerald_Fair"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article219376490.html |title=Kavanaugh supporters should be castrated, D.C. professor wrote.

===Other civil servants===
The [[Internal Revenue Service]] is frequently a target of threats. Examples include the case of ''U.S. v. Darby'', in which the defendant told the IRS he was tired of their [[bullshit]], asked how they would like to have a [[pipe bomb]] delivered to their place of employment, and said that he didn't eat his victims like [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] but just killed them by blowing them up;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=United States v. Darby|court=4th Cir.|date= October 21, 1994|vol=37|reporter=F.3d|opinion=1059}}&lt;/ref&gt; David J. D'Addabbo, who sent a petition to IRS workers warning that they would be "tried by a jury and your penalty will be sought for it to be death by [[firing squad]]" and told the arresting agents to "watch your back";&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Man admits threatening IRS|work=Deseret News | location=Salt Lake City|author=Geoffrey Fattah|date=August 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Cache County man charged with threatening IRS workers|work=Deseret News |location=Salt Lake City|date=March 21, 2006|author=Winslow, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John Barker, who perpetrated an [[anthrax hoax]] against the IRS. According to the [[U.S. Treasury Department]]'s Inspector General for Tax Administration, threats against the IRS have been rising in recent years, and in 2009 rose from 834 to 1,014 per year,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Threats Against IRS Employees on the Rise, Official Says|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704757904575077381781219798|author=Vaughan, Martin|date=February 21, 2010|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; an increase of 21.5% over the prior year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/01/threats-against-irs-emplo_n_481455.html|title=Threats Against IRS Employees On The Rise, Increased 21 Percent From 2008 To 2009|date=March 1, 2010|work=Huffington Post|author=Marcus Baram}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been incidents of actual violence against the IRS to take place as well, by people ramming cars into IRS offices, setting them on fire, and taking out hits on IRS employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2010/03/13/threats_against_irs_workers_continue/|title=Threats against IRS workers continue|date=March 13, 2010|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[2010 Austin plane crash]] was one of the more high-profile incidents. According to a [[Cato Institute]] commentator, "this trend is likely to continue until there is a fundamental change in our tax laws and collection methods. People who do not have access to the media and cannot afford expensive tax lawyers sometimes reach such a level of frustration with the IRS that they resort to violent or irrational behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=11659|title=Morality and the IRS|author=Rahn, Richard W.|date=April 6, 2010|publisher=The Cato Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a special statute, {{usc|26|7212}}, that protects IRS employees from threats, which according to the [[U.S. Attorneys' Manual]], "provides a particularly helpful alternative in cases where there is simply an offer of violence unaccompanied by the potential for imminent use of physical force."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm01572.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal law enforcement agencies are often the target of threats. Examples include Jeff Henry Williamson, who threatened to blow up FBI headquarters, CIA headquarters and the Justice Department;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7324194|title=Houston jury convicts man of threatening FBI, CIA|date=March 10, 2010|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Micha Godfrey, who allegedly emailed [[medical cannabis]] websites threats against DEA agents and their families, and a search of whose house subsequently turned up four firearms, a [[bulletproof vest]], and cannabis plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ticklethewire.com/2010/03/15/calif-man-under-investigation-for-threatening-lives-of-dea-agents-and-families-arrested/|title=

[[Doxing]] is also used against law enforcement officers. During the controversy over full enforcement of immigration laws in the United States in June 2018, the activist Web site [[wikileaks]] published the identities of over 9,000 alleged current and former employees of [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] gleaned from the [[LinkedIn]] Web site, with their places of employment and contact information. &lt;ref name="wikileaks_ICE"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/06/22/wikileaks-publishes-identities-and-information-about-ice-employees-amid-intensifying-anger/ |title=WikiLeaks publishes identities and information about ICE employees amid intensifying anger |website=Washington Post |language=en |access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
When the FBI receives threats over the Internet, it can use [[National Security Letter]]s to obtain the real name, street address and Internet logs of the sender, and those who provide the information were forbidden by the [[PATRIOT Act]] from revealing the request to anyone, until the ''[[Doe v. Ashcroft]]'' case overturned that [[gag rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-07-05-fbi-letters_x.htm|title=With only a letter, FBI can gather private data|date=July 6, 2006|author=Richard Willing|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the federal investigators, political protesters who threaten elected officials or turn violent are easier for law enforcement officials to track due to their vocal and high-profile statements on the internet. For instance, Nigel Coleman posted the address of Rep. [[Tom Perriello]] online and invited people to "visit" the official at his home. The address was actually Perriello's brother Bo. A severed gas line at the home was discovered one day after the address was made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Tea Party makes tracking political criminals easier for law enforcement|date=March 26, 2010|author=McCabe, Virginia|work=FBI Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2010/03/24/2240928.aspx|title=FBI Looks into Gas Line Cut|date=March 24, 2010|author=Domenico Montanaro|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) is an international non-profit advocacy and legal organization based in the United States.

==1990–1995==
*July 10, 1990: EFF is founded and the groundwork is laid for the successful representation of [[Steve Jackson Games]] in a Federal court case to prosecute the [[United States Secret Service]] for unlawfully raiding their offices and seizing computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tuxradar.com/content/inside-electronic-frontier-foundation|title=Inside the Electronic Frontier Foundation {{!}} TuxRadar Linux|website=www.tuxradar.com|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/05/08/your-cyberpunk-games-are-dange.html|title=Your cyberpunk games are dangerous|last=Peterson|first=Jon|date=2015-05-08|website=Boing Boing|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*1994: [[Center for Democracy and Technology]] is formed by Jerry Berman.
*1994: [[Scientology and the Internet|Scientology v. the Internet]].
*1995: ''[[Bernstein v. United States]]''.  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] rules in favor of [[Daniel J. Bernstein]], holding that [[computer software|software]] [[source code]] is speech protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and that the government's regulations preventing its publication were [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://epic.org/crypto/export_controls/bernstein_decision_9_cir.html|title=Bernstein v. USDOJ (9th Cir. May 6, 1999)|website=epic.org|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1995: EFF moves to San Francisco.

==1995–1999==
*1995–1996: EFF opens its "Blue Ribbon Campaign" in direct response to the [[Communications Decency Act]].
*1996: EFF mounts its "Golden Key Campaign" to back calls for liberalisation of [[Export_of_cryptography|cryptography export laws]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Crypto_export/Crypto_bills_1996/eff_procode_ipc_goldkey_960502.announce |title=EFF Helps Plant Seeds of 'Golden Key' Grassroots Campaign For Secure Electronic Communications &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=May 2, 1996 |accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1996: EFF co-founds [[TRUSTe]], the first Privacy Seal company, with CommerceNet, a non-profit industry consortium.
*1998: EFF builds [[EFF DES cracker|Deep Crack]], a machine that decrypts a [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]]-encrypted message after only 56 hours of work, winning [[RSA Security]]'s DES Challenge II-2.
*1999: EFF and Anonymizer launch the Kosovo Privacy Project, an anonymous and secure email and Web surfing service conceived by Alex Fowler and Patrick Ball to ensure the protection of Kosovars, Serbs, and others reporting on the [[Kosovo War]] within the region from reprisal from Serbian officials.

==2001–2004==
*2001: ''[[Felten v. RIAA]]''. EFF supports [[Edward Felten]] in suing RIAA after [[Secure Digital Music Initiative]] (SDMI), RIAA, and [[Verance Corporation]] threaten Felten with legal action under the terms of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) over Felten's plan to present a paper about methods for defeating the SDMI watermarks. The case is dismissed.
*April 2002: EFF supports the [[Chilling Effects (group)|Chilling Effects Clearinghouse]] effort to organize a database of IP law abuse and educate potential victims.
* November 2002: ''[[Universal v. Reimerdes]]'' ("''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly|2600]]'' magazine case"). EFF loses its appeal before the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]], establishing a legal precedent to permit [[prior restraint]]. ''2600'' magazine is restrained from publishing links to the Second Circuit code under provisions of the DMCA and declines to appeal to the Supreme Court.
*December 2003: ''[[RIAA v. Verizon]]'', D.C. Cir. EFF supports [[Verizon Communications]] in a successful challenge to a lower court ruling holding that the company must reveal the identity of a Verizon customer accused of copyright infringement using the [[peer-to-peer]] file-sharing software [[Kazaa]]. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals agrees with Verizon and EFF that the special subpoena provisions in the DMCA apply to potentially infringing material stored on an [[Internet service provider|ISP]] server, not material stored on an individual's own computer.
*2004: ''[[DirecTV v. Treworgy]]'', 11th Circuit.  EFF helps defend "smart card" technology owner Mike Treworgy after [[DirecTV]] sued him based on the fact that he purchased hardware that could be used to intercept the company's satellite TV signals. Treworgy prevails in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which finds that DirecTV cannot sue individuals for "mere possession" of smart-card technology. In separate negotiations with DirecTV, EFF succeeds in getting the company to drop its "guilt-by-purchase" litigation strategy altogether.
*2004-02-18: EFF files [[amicus curiae]] brief in ''1-800 Contacts, Inc. v. WhenU.Com and Vision Direct, Inc.'' appeal (see [[1-800 Contacts]])
*April 19, 2004: EFF initiates the [[Patent Busting Project]] to challenge "illegitimate patents that suppress non-commercial and small business innovation or limit free expression online"
*May 2004: [[American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft (2004)|Doe v. Ashcroft]]. EFF files amicus supporting ACLU's challenge to the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. § 2709, which authorizes the FBI to compel the production of subscriber and communications records in the possession of a broad  range of ISPs, potentially covering billions of records from tens of thousands of entities. These demands, known as National Security Letters, were issued without judicial oversight of any kind, yet allowed the FBI to obtain a vast amount of constitutionally protected information. In September 2004, Judge Victor Marrero of the Southern District of New York issues a landmark decision striking down the NSL statute and the associated gag provision.
*August 2004: ''[[Chamberlain v. Skylink]]''. EFF helps defend Skylink in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]] that puts limits on the controversial "anti-circumvention" provision of the DMCA. Chamberlain, the manufacturer of garage doors, invoked the provision to stop Skylink from selling a "universal" remote control that works with Chamberlain garage doors. The court rejected Chamberlain's claims, noting that if it adopted the company's interpretation of the DMCA, it would threaten many legitimate uses of software within electronic and computer products — something the law aims to protect.
*August 19, 2004: [https://web.archive.org/web/20081011114548/http://eff.org/IP/P2P/MGM_v_Grokster MGM v. Grokster]. EFF prevails before the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] with a decision affirming the "Betamax doctrine" — the rule following the Supreme Court's 1984 holding that a company that creates a technology cannot be held liable for copyright violations by users if the technology has substantial legal uses. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rules that neither were liable for infringements by people using their software to distribute copyrighted works. However, on June 27, 2005 U.S. Supreme Court reverses, finding the defendants liable for copyright infringement, though the Court preserved the Betamax doctrine. Co-defendant Grokster eventually settles with MGM and disbands the company.
*October 6, 2004: EFF submits a [https://www.eff.org/news/archives/2004_10.php#001968 brief] in cooperation with eight other public interest organizations, challenging the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC's]] authority to impose the [[broadcast flag]] mandate, which was to go into effect during July 2005.
*October 15, 2004: EFF successfully represents the non-profit ISP Online Policy Group (OPG) and two Swarthmore College students who published major security flaws in Diebold Election Systems (now [[Premier Election Solutions]]) [[voting machine]]s. From the press release: "Diebold is the first company to be held liable for violating section 512(f) of the DMCA, which makes it unlawful to use DMCA takedown threats when the copyright holder knows that infringement has not actually occurred."
*2004: ''[[JibJab Media v. Ludlow Music]]'', N.D. Cal. EFF successfully defends [[JibJab]], the creators of a parody flash animation piece using [[Woody Guthrie]]'s "[[This Land Is Your Land]]", and uncovered evidence that the classic folk song is in fact already part of the [[public domain]].
*November 2004: EFF files brief opposing the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC's]] proposal to expand [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act|CALEA]] to broadband Internet access providers and [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]] systems.
*December 2004: EFF starts promoting and supporting [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], a second generation Onion Routing network that allows people to communicate anonymously.

==2005–present==
*June 2005: EFF issues a Legal Guide for Bloggers, designed to be a basic roadmap to the legal issues one may confront as a blogger, to let bloggers know their rights.
*October 2005: EFF investigates and documents how the Xerox [[DocuColor]] printer's serial number, as well as the date and time of the printout, are encoded in a repeating 15 by 8 dot pattern in the yellow channel on printed pages. EFF is working to reverse engineer additional printers. (see [[Printer steganography]])
* November 2005: EFF files suit against [[Sony BMG]] — along with two leading national class action law firms — demanding that the company repair the damage done by [[Fortium Technologies]] (then ''First 4 Internet'')'s [[Extended Copy Protection|XCP]] and [[SunnComm]] [[MediaMax CD-3]] software it included on over 24 million music CDs (see [[2005 Sony BMG CD copy prevention scandal]]).

The '''Environmental Protection Agency''' ('''EPA''') is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency]] of the [[United States federal government]] for [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/our-mission-and-what-we-do |title=Our Mission and What We Do|date=January 21, 2017 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Richard Nixon]] proposed the establishment of EPA on July 9, 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/epa/aboutepa/reorganization-plan-no-3-1970.html|title=Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970|last=EPA,OA,OEAEE,OWC|first=US|website=archive.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an [[executive order]]. The [[Reorganization Plan No. 3|order establishing the EPA]] was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate. The agency is led by its [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]], who is appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] and approved by Congress. The current acting Administrator following the resignation of [[Scott Pruitt]] is  Deputy Administrator [[Andrew R. Wheeler|Andrew Wheeler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/05/politics/andrew-wheeler-epa/index.html|title=A former coal lobbyist is the new leader of the EPA|last=CNN|first=Sophie Tatum,|work=CNN|access-date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA is not a [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] department, but the Administrator is normally given [[Cabinet of the United States#Cabinet-level officials|cabinet rank]].

The EPA has its headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]], regional offices for each of the agency's ten [[#EPA regions|regions]], and 27 laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/regionallabs/epa-regional-laboratories-unique-analytical-capabilities-and-services-region |title=EPA Regional Laboratories Unique Analytical Capabilities and Services by Region |date=September 12, 2017 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency conducts [[environmental assessment]], research, and education. It has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in consultation with state, tribal, and local governments. It delegates some permitting, monitoring, and enforcement responsibility to [[U.S. state]]s and the [[List of federally recognized tribes|federally recognized tribes]]. EPA enforcement powers include fines, [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]], and other measures. The agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts.

In 2018, the agency had 14,172 full-time employees.&lt;ref name="EPA's Budget and Spending"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/planandbudget/budget|title=EPA's Budget and Spending|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.|date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of EPA's employees are engineers, scientists, and environmental protection specialists; other employees include legal, public affairs, financial, and information technologists. In 2017 the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] proposed a 31% cut to the EPA's budget to $5.7 billion from $8.1 billion and to eliminate a quarter of the agency jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hiroko Tabuchi |title=What's at Stake in Trump's Proposed E.P.A. Cuts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/climate/trump-epa-budget-cuts.html |date=April 10, 2017 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this cut was not approved by Congress.

The Environmental Protection Agency can only act under statutes, which are the authority of laws passed by Congress. Congress must approve the statute and they also have the power to authorize or prohibit certain actions, which the EPA has to implement and enforce. Appropriations statutes authorize how much money the agency can spend each year to carry out the approved statutes. The Environmental Protection Agency has the power to issue regulations. A regulation is a standard or rule written by the agency to interpret the statute, apply it in situations and enforce it. Congress allows the EPA to write regulations in order to solve a problem, but the agency must include a rationale of why the regulations need to be implemented. The regulations can be challenged by the Courts, where the regulation is overruled or confirmed. Many public health and environmental groups advocate for the agency and believe that it is creating a better world. Other critics believe that the agency commits government overreach by adding unnecessary regulations on business and property owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vig|first1=Norman J.|title=Environmental Policy: New Directions for the Twenty-First Century|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-5063-8346-0|year=2018|pages=167–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray]] introduced a bill, the Resources and Conservation Act (RCA) of 1959, in the [[86th United States Congress|86th Congress]]. The 1962 publication of ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by [[Rachel Carson]] alerted the public about the detrimental effects on the environment of the indiscriminate use of [[pesticide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Griswold |first=Eliza |date=September 21, 2012 |title=How 'Silent Spring' Ignited the Environmental Movement |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/magazine/how-silent-spring-ignited-the-environmental-movement.html |work=New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following, similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the state of the environment and Congress's potential responses. In 1968, a joint House–Senate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]], and the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Representative [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]], to discuss the need for and means of implementing a national environmental policy. In the colloquium, some members of Congress expressed a continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Luther |first=Linda |url=http://www.fta.dot.gov/documents/Unit1_01CRSReport.pdf |title=The National Environmental Policy Act: Background and Implementation |date=2005 |publisher=U.S. Congressional Research Service |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527185951/http://www.fta.dot.gov/documents/Unit1_01CRSReport.pdf |archivedate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Ruckelshaus Swearing In as EPA Administrator.jpg|thumb|left|Ruckelshaus sworn in as first EPA Administrator.]]
On July 9, 1970, Nixon proposed an [[Reorganization Plan No. 3|executive reorganization]] that consolidated many environmental responsibilities of the federal government under one agency, a new Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=July 9, 1970 |title=Reorganization Plans Nos. 3 and 4 of 1970.

The EPA was created 90 days before it had to operate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/600A1DB1B9EF1E85.pdf#page=11|title=Transcript of “Behind the Scenes at the Creation of the EPA” Video|last=Elkins|first=Chuck|date=October 2013|website=EPA Alumni Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and officially opened its doors on December 2, 1970. The agency's first Administrator, [[William Ruckelshaus]], took the oath of office on December 4, 1970.&lt;ref name="EPA-guardian"/&gt;  In its first year, the EPA had a budget of $1.4 billion and 5,800 employees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At its start, the EPA was primarily a technical assistance agency that set goals and standards. Soon, new acts and amendments passed by Congress gave the agency its regulatory authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/600A1DB1B9EF1E85.pdf#page=9|title=Transcript of “Behind the Scenes at the Creation of the EPA” Video|last=Elkins|first=Chuck|date=October 2013|website=EPA Alumni Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA staff recall that in the early days there was "an enormous sense of purpose and excitement" and the expectation that "there was this agency which was going to do something about a problem that clearly was on the minds of a lot of people in this country," leading to tens of thousands of resumes from those eager to participate in the mighty effort to clean up America's environment.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: EPA Administrator Bill Ruckelshaus and some of his closest aides recall the opening months of the new agency in 1970, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=16 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/605EA9C8EF2DD115.pdf#page=2 Transcript] (see p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

When EPA first began operation, members of the private sector felt strongly that the environmental protection movement was a passing fad. Ruckelshaus stated that he felt pressure to show a public which was deeply skeptical about government's effectiveness, that EPA could respond effectively to widespread concerns about pollution.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: EPA Administrator Bill Ruckelshaus and some of his closest aides recall the opening months of the new agency in 1970, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=16 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/605EA9C8EF2DD115.pdf#page=4 Transcript] (see p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1986, when the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] disaster occurred, the EPA was tasked with identifying an impacts on the United States and keeping the public informed. Administrator Lee Thomas assembled a cross-agency team, including personal from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Energy to monitor the situation. They held press conferences for 10 days&lt;ref&gt;An Interview with Lee Thomas, EPA’s 6th Administrator. [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/60740780F5ACB3D5.pdf#page=9 Video], Transcript (see p9). April 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The EPA also researched the implications of stratospheric ozone depletion. Under the leadership of Administrator Lee Thomas, the EPA joined with several international organizations to perform a risk assessment of stratospheric ozone&lt;ref&gt;An Interview with Lee Thomas, EPA’s 6th Administrator.

April 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;, which helped provide motivation for the Montreal Protocol, which was agreed to in August 1987.

In 1988, during his first presidential campaign, [[George H. W. Bush]] was vocal about environmental issues. He appointed as his EPA administrator [[William K. Reilly]], an environmentalist. Under Reilly’s leadership, the EPA implemented voluntary programs and a cluster rule for multimedia regulation. At time, the environment was increasingly being recognized as a regional issue, which was reflected in 1990 amendment of the Clean Air Act and new approaches by the agency&lt;ref&gt;Former Deputy Administrator Hank Habicht talks about management at EPA.

===Regions===
[[File:Regions of the United States EPA.svg|thumb|The administrative regions of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.]]
Creating 10 EPA regions was an initiative that came from President Richard Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: Former EPA Administrator William Ruckelshaus and his senior assistants discuss integrating 10 regional offices into the fledgling agency. [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=16 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/605EA9C8EF2DD115.pdf#page=6 Transcript] (see pp. 6, 9).&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Standard Federal Regions]].

Each EPA regional office is responsible within its states for implementing the Agency's programs, except those programs that have been specifically delegated to states.
* Region 1: responsible within the states of [[Connecticut]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]] ([[New England]]).
* Region 2: responsible within the states of [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is also responsible for the US territories of [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]].
* Region 3: responsible within the states of [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], and the [[District of Columbia]].
* Region 4: responsible within the states of [[Alabama]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kentucky]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Tennessee]].
* Region 5: responsible within the states of [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Ohio]], and [[Wisconsin]].
* Region 6: responsible within the states of [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Texas]].
* Region 7: responsible within the states of [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], and [[Nebraska]].
* Region 8: responsible within the states of [[Colorado]], [[Montana]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Utah]], and [[Wyoming]].
* Region 9: responsible within the states of [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Hawaii]], [[Nevada]], the territories of [[Guam]] and [[American Samoa]], and the [[Navajo Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum Of Agreement between The Navajo Nation and The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Regions 6, 8, and 9 regarding the Implementation of Environmental Standards and Regulations on the Navajo Nation, October 9, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
* Region 10: responsible within the states of [[Alaska]], [[Idaho]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

Each regional office also implements programs on [[List of Indian reservations in the United States|Indian Tribal lands]], except those programs delegated to tribal authorities.

{{Missing information|section|several major EPA programs|date=October 2010}}

It is worth noting that, in looking back in 2013 on the agency he helped shape from the beginning, Administrator William Ruckelshaus observed that a danger for EPA was that air, water, waste and other programs would be unconnected, placed in "silos," a problem that persists more than 50 years later, albeit less so than at the start.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: EPA Administrator William Ruckelshaus comments on the "silos" problem that has dogged EPA from the start in an interview in which he and some of his closest aides recall the opening months of the new agency in 1970, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=16 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/605EA9C8EF2DD115.pdf#page=11 Transcript] (see p. 11).&lt;/ref&gt;

===EPA Safer Choice===
The [[EPA Safer Choice]] label, previously known as the Design for the Environment (DfE) label, helps consumers and commercial buyers identify and select products with safer chemical ingredients, without sacrificing quality or performance. When a product has the Safer Choice label, it means that every intentionally-added ingredient in the product has been evaluated by EPA scientists. Only the safest possible functional ingredients are allowed in products with the Safer Choice label.

===Safer Detergents Stewardship Initiative===
Through the [[EPA Safer Detergents Stewardship Initiative|Safer Detergents Stewardship Initiative]] (SDSI),&lt;ref name="sdsi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/dfe/pubs/projects/formulat/sdsi.htm |title=EPA SDSI Home Page |publisher=Epa.gov |date=December 22, 2008 |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA's Design for the Environment (DfE) recognizes environmental leaders who voluntarily commit to the use of safer [[surfactants]]. Safer surfactants are the ones that break down quickly to non-polluting compounds and help protect aquatic life in both fresh and salt water. [[Nonylphenol ethoxylates]], commonly referred to as NPEs, are an example of a surfactant class that does not meet the definition of a safer surfactant.

The Design for the Environment, which was renamed to [[EPA Safer Choice]] in 2015, has identified safer alternative surfactants through partnerships with industry and environmental advocates. These safer alternatives are comparable in cost and are readily available. CleanGredients&lt;ref name="cleangredients"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleangredients.org |title=CleanGredients Home Page |publisher=Cleangredients.org |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a source of safer surfactants.

=== Energy Star ===
In 1992 the EPA launched the [[Energy Star]] program, a voluntary program that fosters energy efficiency. This program came out an increased effort to collaborate with industry. At the start, it motivated major companies to retrofit millions of square feet of building space with more efficient lighting&lt;ref&gt;Former Deputy Administrator Hank Habicht talks about management at EPA. An Interview with Hank Habicht [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=17 Video], [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/60772C611F145A4D.pdf#page=10 Transcript] (see p 7, 10). December 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. As of 2006, more than 40,000 Energy Star products were available including major appliances, office equipment, lighting, home electronics, and more. In addition, the label can also be found on new homes and commercial and industrial buildings. In 2006, about 12 percent of new housing in the [[United States]] was labeled Energy Star.&lt;ref name=EPA2006&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.energystar.gov/ia/news/downloads/annual_report_2006.pdf "2006 Annual Report: Energy Star and Other Climate Protection Partnerships."]. Retrieved March 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA estimates it saved about $14 billion in energy costs in 2006 alone. The Energy Star program has helped spread the use of [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] [[traffic light]]s, efficient [[fluorescent light]]ing, [[power management]] systems for office equipment, and low [[standby power|standby]] energy use.&lt;ref&gt;EnergyStar.gov, [http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=about.ab_history "History: Energy Star."]. Retrieved March 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart Growth===
EPA's Smart Growth Program, which began in 1998, is to help communities improve their development practices and get the type of development they want. Together with local, state, and national experts, EPA encourages development strategies that protect human health and the environment, create economic opportunities, and provide attractive and affordable neighborhoods for people of all income levels.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth |title=Smart Growth US EPA |website=Epa.gov |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pesticides===
EPA administers the [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]] (FIFRA) (which is much older than the agency) and registers all [[pesticide]]s legally sold in the United States.

===Fuel economy===
The testing system was originally developed in 1972 and used [[driving cycle]]s designed to simulate driving during rush-hour in [[Los Angeles]] during that era. Until 1984 the EPA reported the exact fuel economy figures calculated from the test. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In 1984, the EPA began adjusting city (aka [[UDDS|Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule]] or [[UDDS]]) results downward by 10% and highway (aka HighWay Fuel Economy Test or HWFET) results by 22% to compensate for changes in driving conditions since 1972, and to better correlate the EPA test results with real-world driving. In 1996, the EPA proposed updating the Federal Testing Procedures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/OMS/sftp.htm |title=Federal Test Procedure Revisions |date=October 22, 1996 |website=EPA.gov|access-date=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to add a new higher-speed test (US06) and an air-conditioner-on test (SC03) to further improve the correlation of fuel economy and emission estimates with real-world reports. In December 2006 the updated testing methodology was finalized to be implemented in model year 2008 vehicles and set the precedent of a 12-year review cycle for the test procedures.&lt;ref name="epafe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/420f06069.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907013023/http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/420f06069.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 7, 2008 |title=EPA Fuel Economy |publisher=EPA.gov |date= |access-date=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, EPA launched a program called "Your MPG" that allows drivers to add real-world fuel economy statistics into a database on the EPA's fuel economy website and compare them with others and with the original EPA test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/mpg/MPG.do |title=Welcome to Your MPG!|publisher=FuelEconomy.gov|access-date=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA conducts fuel economy tests on very few vehicles. "Just 18 of the EPA's 17,000 employees work in the automobile-testing department in Ann Arbor, Michigan, examining 200 to 250 vehicles a year, or roughly 15 percent of new models. As to that other 85 percent, the EPA takes automakers at their word—without any testing-accepting submitted results as accurate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/09q3/the_truth_about_epa_city_highway_mpg_estimates-feature |title=The Truth About EPA City / Highway MPG Estimates |date=August 2009 |author=Dave Vanderwerp |website=CarAndDriver.com |access-date=August 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821232506/http://www.caranddriver.com/features/09q3/the_truth_about_epa_city_highway_mpg_estimates-feature |archivedate=August 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two-thirds of the vehicles the EPA tests themselves are randomly selected and the remaining third is tested for specific reasons.

Although originally created as a reference point for fossil-fueled vehicles, [[driving cycle]]s have been used for estimating how many miles an electric vehicle will get on a single charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Chuck Squatriglia |url=https://www.wired.com/autopia/2010/11/honda-finds-evs-a-perfect-fit |title=Honda Finds EVs a Perfect Fit &amp;#124; Autopia |publisher=Wired.com |date=November 17, 2010|access-date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil spill prevention program===
EPA's oil spill prevention program includes the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) and the Facility Response Plan (FRP) rules. The SPCC Rule applies to all facilities that store, handle, process, gather, transfer, refine, distribute, use or consume oil or oil products. Oil products includes petroleum and non-petroleum oils as well as: animal fats, oils and greases; fish and marine mammal oils; and vegetable oils. It mandates a written plan for facilities that store more than 1,320 gallons of fuel above ground or more than 42,000 gallons below-ground, and which might discharge to navigable waters (as defined in the [[Clean Water Act]]) or adjoining shorelines. [[Secondary spill containment]] is mandated at oil storage facilities and oil release containment is required at oil development sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/oil-spills-prevention-and-preparedness-regulations |title=Oil Spills Prevention and Preparedness Regulations |date= March 7, 2017 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxics Release Inventory===
The [[Toxics Release Inventory]] (TRI) is a resource for learning about toxic chemical releases and pollution prevention activities reported by industrial and federal facilities. TRI data support informed decision-making by communities, government agencies, companies, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program |title=Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program |publisher=EPA |publication-date=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WaterSense===
[[WaterSense]] is an EPA program launched in June 2006 to encourage [[water efficiency]] in the [[United States]] through the use of a special [[label]] on [[consumer]] [[Product (business)|products]].&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/watersense/about_us/timeline.html "WaterSense Timeline."] Revised April 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Products include high-efficiency toilets (HETs), bathroom sink faucets (and accessories), and irrigation equipment. WaterSense is a [[wikt:voluntary|voluntary]] program, with EPA developing specifications for water-efficient products through a public process and product testing by independent laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/watersense/news/archive/2006.htm "WaterSense."]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underground Storage Tanks Program ===
EPA regulates underground storage tanks (USTs) containing petroleum and hazardous chemicals under Subtitle I of the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act|Solid Waste Disposal Act]]. This program was launched in 1985 and covers about 553,000 active USTs. Since 1984, 1.8 million USTs have been closed in compliance with regulations. 38 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico manage UST programs with EPA authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/ust/ust-program-facts |title=UST Program Facts |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=May 2018 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the program began EPA had only 90 staff to develop a system to regulate more than 2 million tanks and work with 750,000 owners and operators. Administrator Lee Thomas told the program’s new manager, Ron Brand, that it would have to be done differently that EPA’s traditional approach. This program therefore behaves differently than other EPA offices, focusing much more on local operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/602BCE06FAFAB29B.pdf#page=2|title=Transcript of ‘The Underground Storage Tank Program’s Early Management Challenges’ video|last=Brand|first=Ron|date=April 24, 2013|website=EPA Alumni Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drinking water===
EPA ensures safe [[drinking water]] for the public, by setting standards for more than 160,000 [[public water system]]s nationwide. EPA oversees states, local governments and water suppliers to enforce the standards under the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]]. The program includes regulation of [[injection well]]s in order to protect underground sources of drinking water. Select readings of amounts of certain contaminants in drinking water, precipitation, and surface water, in addition to milk and air, are reported on EPA's Rad Net web site&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/radnet/ EPA&lt;/ref&gt; in a section entitled Envirofacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iaspub.epa.gov/enviro/erams_query_v2.simple_query Envirofacts EPA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024153056/http://iaspub.epa.gov/enviro/erams_query_v2.simple_query |date=October 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite mandatory reporting certain readings exceeding EPA MCL levels may be deleted or not included.&lt;ref name="Bauer2012B"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/20121207_Spike_in_iodine-131_found_in_city_water.html|title=Spike in iodine-131 found in city water|publisher=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|author=Sandy Bauers| date=December 7, 2012| page=2| accessdate=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RadNet2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oaspub.epa.gov/enviro/erams_query_v2.simple_output?Llocation=City&amp;pStation=0&amp;subloc=PHILADELPHIA%2CPA&amp;media=DRINKING+WATER&amp;radi=Iodine-131&amp;Fromyear=1978&amp;Toyear=2012&amp;units=Traditional |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016100440/http://oaspub.epa.gov/enviro/erams_query_v2.simple_output?Llocation=City&amp;pStation=0&amp;subloc=PHILADELPHIA%2CPA&amp;media=DRINKING+WATER&amp;radi=Iodine-131&amp;Fromyear=1978&amp;Toyear=2012&amp;units=Traditional |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |title=Iodine-131 levels in Philadelphia, PA drinking water |work=EPA RadNet Environfacts |publisher=EPA |accessdate=December 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, an EPA draft revision relaxed regulations for radiation exposure through drinking water, stating that current standards are impractical to enforce. The EPA recommended that intervention was not necessary until drinking water was contaminated with radioactive iodine 131 at a concentration of 81,000 picocuries per liter (the limit for short term exposure set by the International Atomic Energy Agency), which was 27,000 times the prior EPA limit of 3 picocuries per liter for long term exposure.&lt;ref name="EPA relaxes regulations"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2013/04/10/epa-draft-stirs-fears-of-radically-relaxed-radiation-guidelines/ |title=EPA Draft Stirs Fears of Radically Relaxed Radiation Guidelines |publisher=Forbes|author=Jeff McMahon|date=April 10, 2013|accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System===
{{see also|United States regulation of point source water pollution}}
The [[National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES) permit program addresses [[water pollution]] by regulating [[point source]]s which discharge to US waters. Created in 1972 by the Clean Water Act, the NPDES permit program authorizes state governments to perform its many permitting, administrative, and enforcement aspects.&lt;ref name="About NPDES"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/about-npdes |title=About NPDES |date=November 29, 2016 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, EPA has approved 47 states to administer all or portions of the permit program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-state-program-information |title=NPDES State Program Information |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2018-08-20 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA regional offices manage the program in the remaining areas of the country.&lt;ref name="About NPDES"/&gt; The Water Quality Act of 1987 extended NPDES permit coverage to [[industrial stormwater]] dischargers and municipal separate storm sewer systems.&lt;ref&gt;Clean Water Act section 402(p); {{USC|33|1342(p)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tools for Schools===
EPA's Indoor Air Quality Tools for Schools Program helps schools to maintain a healthy environment and reduce exposures to indoor environmental contaminants. It helps school personnel identify, solve, and prevent indoor air quality problems in the school environment. Through the use of a multi-step management plan and checklists for the entire building, schools can lower their students' and staff's risk of exposure to asthma triggers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/iaq-schools/indoor-air-quality-tools-schools-action-kit |title=Creating Healthy Indoor Air Quality in Schools &amp;#124; US EPA |website=Epa.gov |date=November 28, 2016 |accessdate=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA has been criticized for its lack of progress towards [[environmental justice]]. Administrator [[Christine Todd Whitman]] was criticized for her changes to President Bill Clinton's [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 12898 during 2001, removing the requirements for government agencies to take the poor and minority populations into special consideration when making changes to environmental legislation, and therefore defeating the spirit of the Executive Order.&lt;ref name="O'Neil report"&gt;O'Neil, S. G. (2007). [http://www.ehponline.org/members/2007/9903/9903.pdf Superfund: Evaluating the Impact of Executive Order 12898] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326091757/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2007/9903/9903.pdf |date=March 26, 2009 }}. Environmental Health Perspectives, Volume 115, Number 7, pp. 1087–93&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 2004 report, the [[Office of the Inspector General|inspector general]] of the agency concluded that the EPA "has not developed a clear vision or a comprehensive strategic plan, and has not established values, goals, expectations, and performance measurements" for environmental justice in its daily operations. Another report in September 2006 found the agency still had failed to review the success of its programs, policies and activities towards environmental justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Robert |last=Bullard |title= Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Regarding Environmental Justice |date=July 25, 2007 |accessdate=October 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also found that poor and minority populations were underserved by the EPA's [[Superfund]] program, and that this situation was worsening.&lt;ref name="O'Neil report"/&gt;

====Barriers to enforcing environmental justice====
{{Original research|section|date=March 2017}}
Many environmental justice issues are local, and therefore difficult to address by a federal agency, such as the EPA. Without strong media attention, political interest, or 'crisis' status, local issues are less likely to be addressed at the federal level compared to larger, well publicized incidents.

Conflicting political powers in successive administrations: The White House maintains direct control over the EPA, and its enforcements are subject to the political agenda of who is in power. Republicans and Democrats differ in their approaches to environmental justice. While President Bill Clinton signed the executive order 12898, the Bush administration did not develop a clear plan or establish goals for integrating environmental justice into everyday practices, affecting the motivation for environmental enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, Robert. ''Growing Smarter: Achieving Livable Communities, Environmental Justice, and Regional Equity''. Cambridge: [[MIT Press]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}

The EPA is responsible for preventing and detecting environmental crimes, informing the public of environmental enforcement, and setting and monitoring standards of air pollution, water pollution, hazardous wastes and chemicals. "It is difficult to construct a specific mission statement given its wide range of responsibilities."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, W. A. "Still reforming after all these years: George W. Bush's new era' at the EPA. Environmental Policy: New directions for the Twenty-first century. Washington DC: [[CQ Press]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}} It is impossible to address every environmental crime adequately or efficiently if there is no specific mission statement to refer to. The EPA answers to various groups, competes for resources, and confronts a wide array of harms to the environment. All of these present challenges, including a lack of resources, its self-policing policy, and a broadly defined legislation that creates too much discretion for EPA officers.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Ronald G. Michael J. Lynch, and Paul Stretesky. Environmental Law, Crime, and Justice. New York: LFB Scholarly publishing Inc, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}

The EPA "does not have the authority or resources to address injustices without an increase in federal mandates" requiring private industries to consider the environmental ramifications of their activities.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Justice Coalition (EJC).

==Research vessel, 2004–2013==
[[File:OSV Bold.jpg|thumb|[[USNS Bold (T-AGOS-12)|OSV ''Bold'']] docked at [[Port Canaveral, Florida]]]]

In March 2004, the U.S. Navy transferred [[USNS Bold (T-AGOS-12)]], a [[Stalwart class ocean surveillance ship|''Stalwart'' class ocean surveillance ship]], to the EPA. The ship had been used in anti-submarine operations during the [[Cold War]], was equipped with sidescan sonar, underwater video, water and sediment sampling instruments used in study of ocean and coastline. One of the major missions of the ''Bold'' was to monitor for ecological impact sites where materials were dumped from dredging operations in U.S. ports.&lt;ref name="bold brochure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/owow/osvbold/brochure.html|title=About the OSV Bold |publisher=EPA |page=EPA 842-F-05-004|accessdate=January 17, 2009|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224070656/http://www.epa.gov/owow/osvbold/brochure.html|archivedate=February 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[General Services Administration]] sold the ''Bold'' to [[Seattle Central Community College]] (SCCC), which demonstrated in a competition that they would put it to the highest and best purpose, at a nominal cost of $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Long |first=Katherine |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021743030_sccvesselxml.html |title=What a $5,000 deal: Seattle Central gets former Navy ship &amp;#124; Local News |publisher=The Seattle Times |date= |accessdate=December 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012042420/https://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021743030_sccvesselxml.html |archivedate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advance identification==
Advance identification, or ADID, is a planning process used by the EPA to identify wetlands and other bodies of water and their respective suitability for the discharge of dredged and fill material. The EPA conducts the process in cooperation with the U.S. [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] and local states or [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American Tribes]]. As of February 1993, 38 ADID projects had been completed and 33 were ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/OWOW/wetlands/facts/fact28.html |title=EPA – Wetlands – Wetlands Fact Sheet |publisher=Epa.gov |date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies (1983–present)==
[[File:EPA HQ - WJ Clinton Building - Main entrance - 2018a.jpg|thumb|right|EPA headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

===Fiscal mismanagement, 1983===
In 1982 Congress charged that the EPA had mishandled the $1.6 billion program to clean up hazardous waste dumps [[Superfund]] and demanded records from EPA director [[Anne Gorsuch Burford|Anne M. Gorsuch]]. She refused and became the first agency director in U.S. history to be cited for [[contempt of Congress]]. The EPA turned the documents over to Congress several months later, after the White House abandoned its court claim that the documents could not be subpoenaed by Congress because they were covered by [[executive privilege]]. At that point, Gorsuch resigned her post, citing pressures caused by the media and the congressional investigation.&lt;ref name=toledoblade&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=73gUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=swIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6140,3000792&amp;dq=anne+mcgill+gorsuch+held+in+contempt+of+congress "Burford Resigns As Administrator of Embattled EPA"], Toledo Blade, March 10, 1983, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Critics charged that the EPA was in a shambles at that time.&lt;ref name=spokanechronicle&gt;Ingersoll, Bruce.

There were also two FBI agents performing an investigation for the Justice Department into possible destruction of documents&lt;ref&gt;An Interview with Lee Thomas, EPA’s 6th Administrator. [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=28 Video], [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/60740780F5ACB3D5.pdf#page=1 Transcript] (see p4). April 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Gorsuch, appointed by [[Ronald Reagan]], resigned under fire in 1983. Gorsuch based her administration of the EPA on the [[New Federalism]] approach of downsizing federal agencies by delegating their functions and services to the individual states.&lt;ref name=epajournal&gt;[http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/views-former-administrators#Gorsuch Views from the Former Administrators] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925054739/http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/views-former-administrators#Gorsuch |date=September 25, 2015 }}, ''EPA Journal'', November 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed that the EPA was over-regulating business and that the agency was too large and not cost-effective. During her 22 months as agency head, she cut the budget of the EPA by 22%, reduced the number of cases filed against polluters, relaxed Clean Air Act regulations, and facilitated the spraying of restricted-use pesticides. She cut the total number of agency employees, and hired staff from the industries they were supposed to be regulating.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;Sullivan, Patricia.

===Political pressure and scientific integrity, 2001–present===
In April 2008, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] said that more than half of the nearly 1,600 EPA staff scientists who responded online to a detailed questionnaire reported they had experienced incidents of political interference in their work. The survey included chemists, toxicologists, engineers, geologists and experts in other fields of science. About 40% of the scientists reported that the interference had been more prevalent in the last five years than in previous years. The highest number of complaints came from scientists who were involved in determining the risks of cancer by chemicals used in food and other aspects of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Meddling at EPA? Activists point to survey; Two thirds of 1,586 EPA scientists polled cite interference, UCS reports |agency=Associated Press |date=April 23, 2008 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24276709/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA research has also been suppressed by career managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stedeford |first=Todd |year=2007 |title=Prior restraint and censorship: acknowledged occupational hazards for government scientists |journal=William and Mary Environmental Law and Policy Review |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=725–745 |url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmelpr/vol31/iss3/4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supervisors at EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment required several paragraphs to be deleted from a peer-reviewed journal article about EPA's [[integrated risk information system]], which led two co-authors to have their names removed from the publication, and the corresponding author, Ching-Hung Hsu, to leave EPA "because of the draconian restrictions placed on publishing".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stedeford|2007|loc=p. 738, note 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA subjects employees who author scientific papers to [[prior restraint]], even if those papers are written on personal time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stedeford|2007|pp=736–740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Government Accountability Office]] stated that the EPA violated federal law with covert propaganda on their social media platforms. The social media messaging that was used promoted materials supporting the [[Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act of 2014|Waters of the United States]] rule, including materials that were designed to oppose legislative efforts to limit or block the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=GAO hits EPA for 'covert propaganda' to promote 'waters of the United States' (WOTUS) rule|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/12/15/gao-hits-epa-for-covert-propaganda-to-promote-waters-of-the-united-states-wotus-rule/|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=December 15, 2015|access-date=December 16, 2015|issn=0190-8286|language=English|first=Jonathan H.|last=Adler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, U.S. Representative [[Matt Gaetz]] (R-Fla.) sponsored [[H.R. 861 (115th Congress)|H.R. 861]], a bill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/861/|title=H.R. 861|publisher=United States Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; to abolish the EPA by 2018. According to Gaetz, "The American people are drowning in rules and regulation promulgated by unelected bureaucrats. And the Environmental Protection Agency has become an extraordinary offender." The bill was co-sponsored by [[Thomas Massie]] (R-Ky.), [[Steven Palazzo]] (R-Ms.) and [[Barry Loudermilk]] (R-Ga.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hensley|first1=Nicole |title=Florida congressman pitches bill that would abolish the Environmental Protection Agency |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/fla-lawmaker-pitches-bill-abolish-epa-article-1.2965042|accessdate=January 6, 2017 |publisher=New York Daily News|date=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuel economy, 2005–2010===
In July 2005, an EPA report showing that auto companies were using loopholes to produce less fuel-efficient cars was delayed. The report was supposed to be released the day before a controversial energy bill was passed and would have provided backup for those opposed to it, but the EPA delayed its release at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/28/business/28fuel.html |title=E.P.A.

In March 2005, nine states (California, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Mexico and Vermont) sued the EPA. The EPA's [[Office of Inspector General (United States)|Inspector General]] had determined that the EPA's regulation of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] emissions did not follow the Clean Air Act, and that the regulations were influenced by top political appointees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A64630-2004Jan30 Proposed Mercury Rules Bear Industry Mark], ''Washington Post'', January 31, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61762-2005Feb3.html EPA Inspector Finds Mercury Proposal Tainted], ''Washington Post'', February 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA had suppressed a study it commissioned by [[Harvard University]] which contradicted its position on mercury controls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55268-2005Mar21.html New EPA Mercury Rule Omits Conflicting Data], ''Washington Post'', March 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The suit alleged that the EPA's rule exempting coal-fired power plants from "maximum available control technology" was illegal, and additionally charged that the EPA's system of [[cap-and-trade]] to lower average mercury levels would allow power plants to forego reducing mercury emissions, which they objected would lead to dangerous local hotspots of mercury contamination even if average levels declined.&lt;ref name=Bustillo2005&gt;Bustillo, Miguel.[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/30/local/me-mercury30 States Sue EPA Over Mercury Emissions], ''LA Times'', March 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Several states also began to enact their own mercury emission regulations.

In response, EPA announced plans to propose such standards to replace the vacated Clean Air Mercury Rule, and did so on March 16, 2011.&lt;ref name="EPA_MATS2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the MATS Regulation|url=https://www.epa.gov/mats/history-mats-regulation |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change, 2007–2017===

{{wikinews|EPA proposes using Clean Air Act to fight global warming}}

In December 2007, EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson approved a draft of a document that declared that climate change imperiled the public welfare—a decision that would trigger the first national mandatory global-warming regulations. Associate Deputy Administrator Jason Burnett e-mailed the draft to the White House. White House aides—who had long resisted mandatory regulations as a way to address climate change—knew the gist of what Johnson's finding would be, Burnett said. They also knew that once they opened the attachment, it would become a public record, making it controversial and difficult to rescind. So they did not open it; rather, they called Johnson and asked him to take back the draft. Johnson rescinded the draft; in July 2008, he issued a new version which did not state that [[global warming]] was danger to public welfare. Burnett resigned in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=An Eroding Mission at EPA; The Bush administration has weakened the agency charged with safeguarding health and the environment |author=John Shiffman and John Sullivan |work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=December 7, 2008 |url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/front_page/20081207_An_Eroding_Mission_at_EPA.html?viewAll=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collusion with Monsanto chemical company ===
In 2015, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC), a branch of the [[World Health Organization]], cited research linking [[glyphosate]], an ingredient of the weed killer Roundup manufactured by the chemical company [[Monsanto]], to [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]].  In March 2017, the presiding judge in a litigation brought about by people who claim to have developed glyphosate-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma opened Monsanto emails and other documents related to the case, including email exchanges between the company and federal regulators.  According to an article in the ''New York Times'', the "records suggested that Monsanto had ghostwritten research that was later attributed to academics and indicated that a senior official at the Environmental Protection Agency had worked to quash a review of Roundup’s main ingredient, glyphosate, that was to have been conducted by the United States Department of Health and Human Services."  The records show that Monsanto was able to prepare "a public relations assault" on the finding after they were alerted to the determination by Jess Rowland, the head of the EPA’s cancer assessment review committee  at that time,  months in advance.  Emails also showed that Rowland "had promised to beat back an effort by the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] to conduct its own review."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hakim|first1=Danny|title=Monsanto Weed Killer Roundup Faces New Doubts on Safety in Unsealed Documents|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/business/monsanto-roundup-safety-lawsuit.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yan|first1=Holly|title=Patients: Roundup gave us cancer as EPA official helped the company|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/15/health/roundup-herbicide-cancer-allegations/index.html|website=CNN|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Arthur|title=EU declared Monsanto weedkiller safe after intervention from controversial US official|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/24/eu-declared-monsanto-weedkiller-safe-after-intervention-from-controversial-us-official|website=The Guardian|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chief Scott Pruitt, 2017 ===
On February 17, 2017, [[Scott Pruitt]] was selected [[Administrator of the EPA]] by president [[Donald Trump]]. This was a seemingly controversial move, as Pruitt had spent most of his career countering environmental policy. He did not have previous experience in the field and had received financial support from the fossil fuel industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/epas-scott-pruitt-haunted-corruption-allegations-old-and-new|title=EPA's Scott Pruitt haunted by corruption allegations, old and new|work=MSNBC|access-date=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pruitt resigned from the position on July 5, 2018, citing "unrelenting attacks" due to ongoing ethics controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/05/politics/scott-pruitt-epa-resigns/index.html|title=EPA chief Scott Pruitt resigns amid ethics scandals|last=CNN|first=[[Jeremy Diamond (journalist)|Jeremy Diamond]], Eli Watkins and Juana Summers,|work=CNN|access-date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''veterans' court''' is a "special court" which is charged with trying cases of minor offenses which involve [[veteran]]s, particularly those diagnosed with [[Military|service]]-related illnesses. The first veterans' court was established in 2008 in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and has been used as a model for establishments of other veterans' courts in other parts of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Special courts in Wash. designed for veterans |author=Kevin Graman |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.armytimes.com/article/20100920/NEWS/9200313/Special-courts-in-Wash-designed-for-veterans |newspaper=Army Times |date=20 September 2010 |accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are questions, however, about the judicial system allowing a "special class." Although the court only deals with misdemeanors, the prosecutors and judges can choose to allow defendants to agree to plead guilty to a misdemeanor, thus reducing the charges.

The system was created to address those veterans who are consistently facing various charges associated with addiction, homelessness, etc. This special allowance, however, often enables vets who aren't on that group to take advantage of avoiding prison. Also, violent felonies are specifically precluded from consideration. Nonetheless, such cases have occurred. In 2012 Richard Thompson Blaney was charged with attempted murder after stabbing his wife three times at their home. With the representation of Congressman James Smith, now a gubernatorial candidate, Blaney walked out of jail after pleading guilty to assault. He served less than a year.

==San Diego==
In January 2011, a Veterans' Court pilot program was established in [[San Diego]]. Both veterans and active duty service members have been accepted as participants. To be accepted into the program the individual must meet certain criteria:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

* The applicant must be a veteran of the [[United States military]].
* The charges that are brought against the applicant must have some relation to their military service.
* The applicant must be accepted into the program by the Veterans' Court Judge. Recommendations by the Veterans' Court team helps, but is not necessarily required.

There are certain charges that will preclude an applicant from being accepted in the program. Those are the more violent charges that include murder, manslaughter, homicide, rape or gang-affiliated crimes.

;Participation

Once an applicant is accepted they are considered a participant. Participation in the program consists of intensive supervision from probation, the VA and the court. Each participant must meet several goals in order to move to the next phase of the program, 4 in total. There is no set timeframe in which the program must be completed. While in the program each veteran must attend weekly therapy and, more often than not, counseling for Post Traumatic Stress. Bi-monthly urinalysis must be conducted at random either in a treatment facility or at the [[Veterans Health Administration|VA hospital]]. 
;Goal

The goal of veterans' court is to allow the veteran to be rehabilitated to the law-abiding citizen they were before their experience in the military and combat. There are no guaranteed incentives for any participant who satisfactorily completes the program. Typical incentives do include taking years off of probation and moving from formal to summarized probation. At the completion, fees can be waived, and felonies can be commuted, and under a new addition to [[California Penal Code]] 1170.9,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/1170.9.html|title=California Penal Code  Section 1170.9 - California Attorney Resources - California Laws|website=law.onecle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; judges may expunge charges completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiego.va.gov/features/veterans_court.asp|title=VASDHS &amp; San Diego Veterans Court Offers Road to Redemption - VA San Diego Healthcare System|first=VA San Diego Healthcare|last=System|website=www.sandiego.va.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Team

The court process is aided by Veterans Justice Outreach representatives from the Veterans Administration. Representatives of the District Attorney's office, the Public Defender's office, treatment facilities and probation are also in attendance at every hearing. Each participant is also given a mentor to work one on one with throughout the process.

==Scope==
The term is most often used to describe the GPL,&lt;ref name="GPLviral"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buddlefindlay2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nmr-gpl"/&gt; which requires that any derivative work also be licensed under compatible licenses with the GPL. The [[Viral phenomenon|viral component]] is described as such because the licenses spreads a continuing use of the licenses in its derivatives.&lt;ref name=Gorden /&gt; The "virality" can force a license change of free software, e.g. when software is derived from two or more sources having [[License incompatibility|incompatible viral licenses]] in which the derivative work could not be re-licensed at all.&lt;ref name="GPLviral"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011222205401/http://icfcst.kiev.ua/panorama/OSS/bsd_vs_gpl.shtml |title=Comparative merits of GPL, BSD and Artistic licences (Critique of Viral Nature of GPL v.2 - or In Defense of Dual Licensing Idea) |archivedate=2001-12-22 |url=http://icfcst.kiev.ua/panorama/OSS/bsd_vs_gpl.shtml |author=Nikolai Bezroukov |author-link=Nikolai Bezroukov |quote=''Viral property stimulates proliferation of licenses and contributes to the "GPL-enforced nightmare" -- a situation when many other licenses are logically incompatible with the GPL and make life unnecessary difficult for developers working in the Linux environment (KDE is a good example here, Python is a less known example).'' |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the concept is generally associated with licenses that promote [[free content]], some have attempted to compare it to the proprietary [[original equipment manufacturer]] source code software distribution agreements which grant licensees the right to redistribute copies of the software, but restrict what terms can be in the [[end user license agreement]].&lt;ref name=Meeker /&gt; Such licenses could be considered viral if they led derivative or connected software to gain the same license.

As an example of viral licensing outside software, after it was revealed that French author [[Michel Houellebecq]] [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] sections of Wikipedia articles in his novel ''[[The Map and the Territory|La Carte et Le Territoire]]'', some commentators said that this automatically made his entire book licensed under the [[Creative Commons|CC-BY-SA]] Attribution and ShareAlike license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20101128/17552312024/french-author-plagiarizes-wikipedia-does-that-mean-his-entire-book-is-now-cc-licensed.shtml |title=French Author Plagiarizes Wikipedia; Does That Mean His Entire Book Is Now CC Licensed? |publisher=Techdirt.com |date=2010-11-29 |accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the term==
According to [[Free Software Foundation]] compliance engineer David Turner, the term ''viral license'' creates a misunderstanding and a fear of using copylefted free software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxtoday.com/developer/2006082902126OSHLLL |title=IT Manager's Journal: 10 Common Misunderstandings About the GPL |first=Bruce |last=Byfield |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David McGowan has written that there is no reason to believe the GPL could force proprietary software to become free software, but could "try to enjoin the firm from distributing commercially a program that combined with the GPL'd code to form a derivative work, and to recover damages for [[copyright infringement|infringement]]."  If the firm "actually copied code from a GPL'd program, such a suit would be a perfectly ordinary assertion of copyright, which most private firms would defend if the shoe were on the other foot."&lt;ref&gt;

Richard Stallman has described this view with an analogy, saying, "The GPL's domain does not spread by proximity or contact, only by deliberate inclusion of GPL-covered code in your program. It spreads like a [[Chlorophytum comosum|spider plant]], not like a virus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Interoperability==
Popular copyleft licenses, such as the GPL, have a clause allowing components to interact with non-copyleft components as long as the communication is abstract, such as executing a [[command-line]] tool with a set of switches or interacting with a [[Web server]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation |title=Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] |date=24 June 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, even if one module of an otherwise non-copyleft product is placed under the GPL, it may still be legal for other components to communicate with it normally. This allowed communication may or may not include reusing libraries or routines via [[dynamic linking]] — some commentators say it does,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/Licensing-HOWTO.html#id2789302 |title=Licensing HOWTO |date=9 November 2002 |first=Eric Steven |last=Raymond |authorlink=Eric S. Raymond |accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Free Software Foundation|FSF]] asserts it does not and explicitly adds an [[GPL linking exception|exception allowing it]] in the license for the [[GNU Classpath]] re-implementation of the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] library.

The interoperability clauses are often pragmatically inoperative due to the vigorous enforcement and strict interpretation of the GPL as it related to integration, aggregation, and linking. It is argued that most forms of incorporation, aggregation, or connectivity with GPL-licensed code is a derivative work that must be licensed under the GPL. In recent years, a number of communities using GPL-incompatible licenses have dropped efforts and support for interoperability with GPL-licensed products in response to this trend. Some developers and communities have switched to the GPL or a GPL-compatible license in response, which critics and supporters alike agree is intentional end result. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

== Conceptual Framework==

Conceptually, Work 4.0 reflects the current fourth phase of work relations, having been preceded by the birth of industrial society and the first workers' organizations in the late 18th century (Work 1.0), the beginning of mass production and of the welfare state in the late 19th century (Work 2.0), and the advent of [[globalization]], [[digitalization]] and the transformation of the [[social market economy]] since the 1970s (Work 3.0). By contrast, Work 4.0 is characterized by a high degree of integration and cooperation, the use of digital technologies (e.g. the [[internet]]), and a rise in flexible work arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2015). ''Re-Imagining Work: Green Paper Work 4.0'', pp. 33-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Its drivers include [[digitalization]], [[globalization]], [[demographic change]] (ageing, [[Human migration|migration]]), and cultural change.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2017). ''Re-Imagining Work: White Paper Work 4.0'', pp. 18-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges include 
* (i) the transformation of economic sectors and activities and its effect on employment,
* (ii) the creation of new markets and new forms of work through digital platforms,
* (iii) the issues associated with [[Big Data]] (e.g. data protection),
* (iv) the relationship between the use of human and machine labour (upskilling vs. deskilling, devaluation of experience, individual support vs. behavioural monitoring),
* (v) the possibility of flexible work conditions regarding time and location, and 
* (vi) profound changes in the structures of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2017). ''Re-Imagining Work: White Paper Work 4.0'', pp. 42-91.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response to these challenges, the BMAS has developed a "vision for quality jobs in the digital age", based on policies such as moving from [[unemployment insurance|unemployment]] to [[employment insurance]], the promotion of self-determined flexible working time arrangements, improvements in the working conditions of the service sector, new ergonomic approaches to [[occupational health and safety]], high standards in employee [[data protection]], the co-determination and participation of social partners in employment relations, better social protection for self-employed persons, and the beginning of a European dialogue on the future of the welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2017). ''Re-Imagining Work: White Paper Work 4.0'', pp. 98-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[World Bank]] Analysis==
The [[World Development Report]] 2019 argues that a new social contract is needed to address longer work transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2019|title=The Changing Nature of Work|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors [[Simeon Djankov]] and Federica Saliola documents examples of countries and companies that have created new ways to deliver social insurance.
