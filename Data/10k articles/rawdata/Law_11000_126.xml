The '''2008 Liechtenstein tax affair''' is a series of tax investigations in numerous countries whose governments suspect that some of their citizens may have evaded tax obligations by using banks and trusts in [[Liechtenstein]]; the affair broke open with the biggest complex of investigations ever initiated for [[tax evasion]] in the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Skandal gigantischen Ausmaßes |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/,tt2m2/wirtschaft/artikel/599/158176/ |work=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |language=German |date=2008-02-15 |accessdate=2008-02-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103013551/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/%2Ctt2m2/wirtschaft/artikel/599/158176/ |archivedate=November 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen also as an attempt to put pressure on Liechtenstein, one of the remaining uncooperative tax havens, as identified by the [[FATF Blacklist|Financial Action Task Force (FATF)]] on [[Money Laundering]] of the Paris-based [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], along with [[Andorra]] and [[Monaco]], in 2007.&lt;ref name="wsj0219"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Esterl |first1=Mike |last2=Simpson |first2=Glenn R.| authorlink2=Glenn R.

== Background ==
Millions of [[euro]]s belonging to hundreds of citizens living in Germany were channeled into the [[LGT Bank]] and [[List of banks in Liechtenstein|other banks in Liechtenstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Keuchel |first=Jan |author2=Andresen, Tino |title=Nächste Woche knallt es wieder |url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/News/Recht-Steuern/Meldungen/_pv/_p/204872/_t/ft/_b/1391899/default.aspx/naechste-woche-knallt-es-wieder.html |work=[[Handelsblatt]] |language=German |date=2008-02-16 |accessdate=2008-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219232712/http://www.handelsblatt.com/News/Recht-Steuern/Meldungen/_pv/_p/204872/_t/ft/_b/1391899/default.aspx/naechste-woche-knallt-es-wieder.html |archive-date=2008-02-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; taking advantage of Liechtenstein-based [[trust law|trusts]] to evade paying taxes in Germany. According to the prosecutor's office these trusts "have been created apparently only to evade paying taxes."&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the law in Liechtenstein, such trusts allow the separation of monetary assets from their owners and are kept anonymously. In contrast to trusts of most other countries, Liechtenstein trusts can be revoked at any time and the assets will be returned to the owner. Furthermore, such trusts as well as their maintaining shell entities are only charged 0.1% (minimum 1,000 [[Swiss franc]]s) annually.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite news |title=German Banks Suspected of Helping Clients Evade Taxes |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,536777,00.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=2008-02-21 |accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liechtenstein thus is known to be a [[tax haven]].&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pfanner

== Investigations ==

=== Germany ===
According to the lead prosecuting office responsible for economic crime in [[Bochum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.sta-bochum.nrw.de/pressmit/Presse15_2.doc |title=Press release of the prosecuting office, Bochum |language=German |date=2008-02-15 |accessdate=2008-02-15|format=DOC}} {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is supported by prosecuting offices in other towns as well as the criminal police, currently about 600 to 700 individuals are suspected in the investigations. In addition, search warrants have been issued. An official confirmation about the total number of suspects and amount of money involved has not yet been issued. According to the prosecutors, current investigations provide a "very high level of evidence."&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;

The affair became known on February 14, 2008, when a raid was conducted against [[Klaus Zumwinkel]], the [[chief executive]] of [[Deutsche Post|Deutsche Post AG]], under the suspicion that he evaded about 1 million € ([[United States dollar|$]]1.46 million) in taxes.&lt;ref name="nyt0218"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dougherty |first=Carter |author2=Landler, Mark |title=Tax Scandal in Germany Fans Complaints of Inequity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/18/business/worldbusiness/18tax.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=2008-02-18 |accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usat0218"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Matt |title=Germany expands probe of Liechtenstein tax evasion |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/world/2008-02-18-germany-tax-evasion_N.htm |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=2008-02-18 |accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressured by the government, Zumwinkel resigned from his position.&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;{{cite news|title=Liechtenstein tax scandal hits banks |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23238389-20501,00.html |work=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[The Australian]] |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2008-02-20 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110811192325/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business-old/industry-sectors/liechtenstein-tax-scandal-hits-banks/story-e6frg96f-1111115587424 |archivedate=11 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly a number of other individuals have been under investigation for months, and the appearance that the well-to-do have ways and means to evade the German tax laws has caused complaints about inequality.&lt;ref name=nyt0218/&gt;

According to a report by the ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', Heinrich Kieber, a bank computer technician,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landespolizei.li/News/Pressemitteilungen/tabid/850/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/263/ffentliche-Fahndung-nach-Heinrich-KIEBER.aspx Kiebler's profile @ Liechtenstein's police website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317155257/http://www.landespolizei.li/News/Pressemitteilungen/tabid/850/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/263/ffentliche-Fahndung-nach-Heinrich-KIEBER.aspx |date=March 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; sold a [[Compact Disc|CD]] with incriminating bank information to the [[Bundesnachrichtendienst]] (BND, English: Federal Intelligence Service), which handed the material over to the tax investigation office in [[Wuppertal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Philip |last=Eppelsheim |authorlink= |title=Deutschland vor historischem Steuerskandal |url=http://www.faz.net/s/RubA5A53ED802AB47C6AFC5F33A9E1AA71F/Doc~ED3D316A995614567A8DBF27E57AE8BA0~ATpl~Ecommon~Sspezial.html |work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |publisher= | language=German |date=2008-02-15 |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kieber was paid €4.2 million by the [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Finance]] for the data on which the investigation is based.&lt;ref name=wsj0219/&gt; Facing death threats, the informant is currently in hiding and has asked for police protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Friedrich |last=Kuhn |authorlink= |title=Informant im Fadenkreuz - Tippgeber von Liechtenstein muss völlig neue Identität erhalten - Fahnder rätseln über Zumwinkels Motiv |url=http://www.live-pr.com/ddp-djn-hintergrund-informant-im-r1048182772.htm |work={{Interlanguage link multi|Deutscher Depeschendienst|de}} |publisher= |language=German |date=2008-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305045124/http://www.live-pr.com/ddp-djn-hintergrund-informant-im-r1048182772.htm |archivedate=2008-03-05 |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kieber is wanted by [[Interpol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/2795011/Interpol-seeks-Liechtenstein-tax-mole.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Interpol seeks Liechtenstein tax mole | first1=James | last1=Quinn | date=2008-08-19 | accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' indicated on February 19, 2008, the name of the informant who apparently lives now in Australia and had sold the data to tax ministries of a number of countries, including the United States.&lt;ref name=wsj0219/&gt;

A number of raids were conducted in Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt and other cities. Several banks were searched including [[Bankhaus Metzler]], the [[Hauck &amp; Aufhäuser]] bank, [[Dresdner Bank]], [[UBS AG|UBS]] in Munich and the [[Berenberg Bank]] in Hamburg.&lt;ref name=usat0218/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Fahnder durchsuchen erneut Banken in München und Hamburg |url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,536284,00.html |work=[[Spiegel Online]] |publisher= |language=German |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime revenue offices also noted a higher number of voluntary [[self-incrimination]]s - this will avoid or reduce punitive damages - for possible tax evasions by people with financial assets in Liechtenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jens |last=Tartler |authorlink= |author2=Ehrlich, Peter |author3=Lockhart, Ina |author4=Lambrecht, Matthias |title=Razzia bei deutschen Privatbanken |url=http://www.ftd.de/politik/:Razzia%20Privatbanken/319075.html |work=[[Financial Times Deutschland]] |publisher= |language=German |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2008-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223062408/http://www.ftd.de/politik/:Razzia%20Privatbanken/319075.html |archive-date=2008-02-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the BND received the data in 2006, the LGT Group indicated that in 2002 secret information had been stolen but the informant had been caught and tried in 2003, and all material had been returned.&lt;ref name=nyt0218/&gt;

=== United States of America ===
The informant also had sold data to the government of the United States. After the affair broke open, Senator [[Carl Levin]], chairman of a senate investigations committee, indicated his intention to probe to what degree American citizens have used the LGT bank to evade taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.morningstar.com/newsnet/ViewNews.aspx?article=/DJ/200802211720DOWJONESDJONLINE001112_univ.xml|title=Sen Levin Concerned Liechtenstein Bank Drawing Tax Evaders |author= AFP |publisher=Morningstar | date=2008-02-21| accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008 the U.S. Subcommittee determined that the offshore tax haven saved $100 billion per year for the U.S. taxpayer. Specifically mentioned were Switzerland's [[UBS AG]] and Liechtenstein's LGT Group. The report indicates that the LGT Group contributed to a "culture of secrecy and deception". According to the report UBS holds 1,000 declared accounts versus 19,000 that are not declared to the IRS. The report recommended a number of steps including tighter regulations for financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com//id/25713850 |agency=Associated Press |title=USB, Liechtenstein Aided US Tax Cheats: Senate| date=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland===
According to the LGT Bank some 20 Finns had evaded tax in Finland via accounts containing €50-60 million in deposited funds. This was the largest known tax avoidance case in Finland. Most names are secret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/kaikkien_aikojen_veronkiertotutkinta_kuivui_kokoon_-_varoja_piilottaneet_suomalaiset_jaavat_ilman_rikosseuraamuksia/6836906 Kaikkien aikojen veronkiertotutkinta kuivui kokoon - varoja piilottaneet suomalaiset jäävät ilman rikosseuraamuksia] yle 18.9.2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/supreme_court_ruling_hobbles_liechtenstein_tax_probe/6838343 Supreme Court ruling hobbles Liechtenstein tax probe] Yle 19.9.2013&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Helsingin Sanomat]] in Sept/Oct 2013 Lichtenstein [[tax havens]] accounts include funds of [[Casimir Ehrnrooth]] (see [[UPM (company)|UPM]], [[YIT]], [[Jaakko Pöyry]] and [[Guggenheim Helsinki Plan]]) [[Paulig|Bertel Paulig]] (coffee, spices) and a construction company owners in [[Turku]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/talous/Bertel+Paulig+j%C3%A4i+kiinni+veroparatiisitilist%C3%A4/a1381207258042  Bertel Pauligilla veroparatiisitili] 9.10.2013 A9&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventeen Finns paid additional taxes totalling €10 million. The taxpayers initiated actions in the [[Judicial system of Finland#Administrative Courts|Administrative Court]]. The decisions are not public. According to Finnish law the cost of hidden taxes can be up to 30%. In two cases shown for the reporters the administrative Court acted ca 1% interest rate payment. In one case hidden funds were in total €483.000 and acted additional tax was €4.350. In addition to this, tax payers must pay the avoided taxes and an interest of the tax funds not paid in time. According to the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Finland]] no other legal procedures are possible, than collecting the hidden tax and its 1% [[interest rate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/liechtensteinin_veronkiertojutussa_on_maaratty_hyvin_pienia_veronkorotuksia/6984649 Liechtensteinin veronkiertojutussa on määrätty hyvin pieniä veronkorotuksia] yle 16.12.2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===
On February 24, 2008, it became apparent that secret bank information had also been sold to the [[United Kingdom|British]] tax authorities and that about 100 individuals in the UK are at risk for investigations for tax evasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/money/tax/article3423428.ece |title=Revenue men prise open princely tax haven, Liechtenstein |last=Watts|first=Robert|author2=Matthew Campbell|author3=Nicola Smith |publisher=The Sunday Times (Timesonline) |date=2008-02-24 |accessdate=2008-02-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The informant also provided the governments of Australia, Canada and France with data.&lt;ref name="spiegel26"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,537742,00.html | title=Deutschland verschenkt Steuersünder-Daten an Regierungen in aller Welt |

== Aftermath ==

===Early reactions===
The principality of [[Liechtenstein]] is directly affected by the affair as the LGT Bank is owned by the [[reign]]ing [[princely family of Liechtenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title= Liechtensteins Ruf ist ruiniert |url=https://www.welt.de/finanzen/article1678860/Liechtensteins_Ruf_ist_ruiniert.html |work=[[Die Welt]] Online |language=German |date=2008-02-15 |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The affair overshadowed the previously planned visit of [[Otmar Hasler]], the Prime Minister of Liechtenstein, to Berlin on February 19, 2008, to meet with the Minister of Finance, [[Peer Steinbrück]], and the Chancellor, [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref name=usat0218/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Regierungschef Otmar Hasler bei Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel |publisher= |date=2008-02-15 |url=http://www.presseportal.ch/de/pm/100000148/100554858/presse_informationsamt_des_fuerstentums_liechtenstein |language=German |accessdate= |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305011924/http://www.presseportal.ch/de/pm/100000148/100554858/presse_informationsamt_des_fuerstentums_liechtenstein |archive-date=2008-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel asked for help in the investigation and cooperation in prevention of tax evasion, pointing out that Liechtenstein provided the US [[Internal Revenue Service]] with some data but not the German Ministry of Finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Pfanner |authorlink= |author2=Landler, Mark |title=Tax Inquiry?

The head prosecutor of Liechtenstein Robert Wallner initiated an [[indictment]] "against unknown perpetrators for the violation of company secrets for a foreign country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= |title=Head Prosecutor of Liechtenstein initiates indictment "against unknown perpetrators" |url=http://live.radio.li/archiv/radiol-2008-02-18_1230.mp3 |format=[[MP3]] |medium= |publisher=Radio-Liechtenstein |location= |accessdate=2008-02-24 |time= |quote= }} {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, two lawyers in Berlin initiated [[lawsuit]]s against the BND and the Federal government claiming among others "infidelity toward the taxpayer" and "spying of data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Strafanzeige gegen BND und Bundesregierung |url=http://www.netzeitung.de/politik/deutschland/907177.html |work=[[Netzeitung]] |publisher= |language=German |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German government, on the other hand, is considering a coordinated international action: according to internal sources of the Ministry of Finances Liechtenstein supposedly lives to "a good part from the business of evading taxes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Berlin will Geschäfte mit Liechtenstein radikal einschränken |url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,536415,00.html |work=Spiegel Online |publisher= |language=German |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government may consider a number of possible actions: Liechtenstein is about to join the [[Schengen Agreement]] which would eliminate its border controls towards Austria, and Germany's consent is required; Germany could impose fees on transfers of currency, place taxes on business activities of its citizens in Liechtenstein, and require them to prove that their activities there are legitimate. Furthermore, it counts on the support of other governments who also feel the sting of tax evasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/business/worldbusiness/21tax.html?ex=1361250000&amp;en=ea5a64a160364fb7&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |title=Germany Prods Liechtenstein to Fight Fraud |last=Dougherty |first=Carter |author2=Landler, Mark |work=The New York Times |date=2008-02-21 |accessdate=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions have also been raised within Germany as to the internal legality of the matter.  Concerns have been voiced that the actions taken by BND were outside the agency's national security (and constitutional) remit, with attention also focusing on the wider ethical debate as to whether BND was justified in paying a €4m bribe to a bank official in a foreign country (with financing and approval from both the German chancellery and finance ministry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Not so fine in Liechtenstein|url=http://www.economist.com/agenda/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10750259|work=The Economist|date=2008-02-22|accessdate=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009 Germany announced that it will not grant judicial assistance to Liechtenstein in the prosecution of the assumed perpetrator, claiming [[Ordre public]] overrides its duty to do so under the European Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fall Heinrich Kieber: Deutschland lehnt Rechtshilfegesuch ab |url=http://www.vaterland.li/page/newsticker/eigene.cfm?id=3242&amp;zeitraum=30 |work=Liechtensteiner Vaterland |date=2009-03-23 |accessdate=2009-04-16 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5h7IMZWgT?url=http://www.vaterland.li/page/newsticker/eigene.cfm?id=3242&amp;zeitraum=30 |archivedate=2009-05-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax treaties===
Liechtenstein entered negotiations with a number of countries to discuss tax avoidance issues. It reached an agreement with the United Kingdom in 2009 that will allow the about 5,000 British customers of Liechtenstein's banks that hold for them about ₤2-3 billion in secret accounts to come clear with British tax authorities under terms of a significantly reduced penalty.&lt;ref name="FT0809"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simonian H |title=Liechtenstein in talks with Germany on transparency |journal=Financial Times |date=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement would open up Liechtenstein's banks to greater transparency, but remains controversial in Liechtenstein; some banks fear that clients will just move their money elsewhere.&lt;ref name=FT0809/&gt;

The '''Administration on Aging''' ('''AoA''') is an agency of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]. AoA works to ensure that older Americans can stay independent in their communities, mostly by awarding grants to States, Native American tribal organizations, and local communities to support programs authorized by Congress in the [[Older Americans Act]].  AoA also awards discretionary grants to research organizations working on projects that support those goals. It conducts [[statistical]] activities in support of the research, analysis, and evaluation of programs to meet the needs of an aging population.

AoA's FY 2013 budget proposal includes a total of $1.9 billion, $819 million of which funds senior nutrition programs like [[Meals on Wheels]]. The agency also funds $539 million in grants to programs to help seniors stay in their homes through services (such as accomplishing essential activities of daily living, like getting to the doctor's office, buying groceries etc.) and through help given to caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.acl.gov/sites/default/files/about-acl/2016-09/FY_2013_AoA_Budget_Statement%5B1%5D.pdf FY 2013 President's Budget Justification for Appropriations Committees of Congress, p.22]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these grants are for ''Cash &amp; Counseling'' programs that provide Medicaid participants a monthly  budget for home care and access to services that help them manage their finances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/self-directed-budget-enhances-access-home-health-and-other-needed-services-resulting-fewer Self-Directed Budget Enhances Access to Home Health and Other Needed Services, Resulting in Fewer Unmet Needs, Better Health Outcomes, and High Satisfaction for Medicaid Beneficiaries]&lt;/ref&gt;

AoA is headed by the Assistant Secretary for Aging. From July 2016 to August 2017, Edwin Walker served as Acting Assistant Secretary for Aging.&lt;ref name=leadershipACL&gt;{{cite web |title=Leadership |date=19 August 2016 |website=Administration for Community Living |url=https://www.acl.gov/about-acl/organization/leadership }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assistant Secretary reports directly to the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]].

{{Euthanasia}}
'''''Baxter v. Montana''''', is a [[Montana Supreme Court]] case, argued on September 2, 2009, and decided on December 31, 2009, that addressed the question of whether the state's constitution guaranteed terminally ill patients a right to lethal prescription medication from their physicians.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Kirk.  [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/us/01montana.html Montana Court to Rule on Assisted Suicide Case], ''The New York Times'', August 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Montana Supreme Court sidestepped the question of if [[medical aid in dying]] is guaranteed under Montana State Constitution, but it instead ruled, on narrower grounds, that neither legal precedent nor the state's statute deem such assistance to be against public policy or illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/us/01suicide.html|title=Montana Ruling Bolsters Doctor-Assisted Suicide|last=Johnson|first=Kirk|date=2009-12-31|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montana is one of seven states in which aid in dying is authorized. The others are California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii and Vermont: it is authorized in the District of Columbia as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/12/16/medical-aid-in-dying-law-takes-effect/|title=Colorado medical-aid-in-dying law signed, takes effect immediately|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of the case==

The original lawsuit was brought by four Montana physicians (Stephen Speckart, C. Paul Loehnen, Lar Autio, and George Risi, Jr., M.D.s), [[Compassion &amp; Choices]] and  Robert Baxter, a seventy-six-year-old truck driver from [[Billings, Montana]], who was dying of [[lymphocytic leukemia]]. The plaintiffs asked the court to confirm a constitutional right "to [[Medical aid in dying|receive and provide aid in dying]]".&lt;ref&gt;Original plaintiff's filing [http://compassionandchoices.org/documents/Baxter%20complaint.pdf Baxter v Montana]&lt;/ref&gt; The state argued that "the Constitution confers no right to aid in ending one’s life."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Kirk. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/us/01montana.html Montana Court to Rule on Assisted Suicide Case], ''The New York Times'', August 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Dorothy McCarter, of Montana's First Judicial District Court, ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on December 5, 2008, stating that the "constitutional rights of individual privacy and human dignity, taken together, encompass the right of a competent terminally-ill patient to die with dignity."&lt;ref&gt;Montana District Court Judge Dorothy McCarter, decision to grant motion for summary judgment [http://compassionandchoices.org/documents/McCarter_Opinion_Montana.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Baxter died that same day.&lt;ref name="BGSep209" /&gt;

The Montana Attorney General appealed the case to the state supreme court. Oral arguments were heard on September 2, 2009.&lt;ref name="BGSep209"&gt;Billings Gazette: [http://www.billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/article_c4552348-9834-11de-96ac-001cc4c002e0.html Personal choice vs. public interest: ‘Right to die’ argued], September 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amicus briefs]] filed on behalf of those asking the court to grant the constitutional right to receive/provide aid in dying include human rights groups,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compassionandchoices.org//documents/BaxterHumanRightsAmicusBrief.pdf Human Rights Groups Amicus for plaintiffs/appellees]&lt;/ref&gt; women's rights groups,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compassionandchoices.org//documents/BaxterWomensRightsAmicusBrief.pdf Women's Rights Groups Amicus for plaintiffs/appellees]&lt;/ref&gt; The American Medical Women's Association/American Medical Students Association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compassionandchoices.org//documents/BaxterAMSA:AMWA.AmicusBrief.pdf American Medical Women's Association/American Medical Students Association Amicus Brief for plaintiffs/appellees]&lt;/ref&gt; clergy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compassionandchoices.org//documents/BaxterReligiousAmicusBrief.pdf Clergy Amicus Brief for plaintiffs/appellees]&lt;/ref&gt; legal scholars,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compassionandchoices.org//documents/BaxterLegalScholarsAmicusBrief.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; thirty-one Montana state legislators&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compassionandchoices.org//documents/AmicusCuriaeMontanaLegislators.pdf Montana Legislators Amicus Brief for plaintiffs/appellees]&lt;/ref&gt; and bioethicists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compassionandchoices.org//documents/MontanaBioethicistsAmicusBrief.pdf Bioethicists Amicus Brief for plaintiffs/appellees]&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

Among the groups filing [[amicus briefs]] on behalf of the state were the Alliance Defense Fund on behalf of the [[Family Research Council]], [[Americans United for Life]], the [[American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], disability rights group [[Not Dead Yet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://notdeadyet.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/montanabrieffnl.doc]&lt;/ref&gt;, and the [[Catholic Medical Association]].  

The Montana Medical Association issued a statement opposing physician-assisted suicide, but refused to file an ''[[amicus brief]]'' in the appeal.

==Verdict==
On Dec. 31, 2009, the [[Montana Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of Baxter. Although they did not address the constitutional question, they ruled on narrower grounds saying that "nothing in Montana Supreme Court precedent or Montana statutes indicating that physician aid in dying is against public policy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/us/01suicide.html Montana Ruling Bolsters Doctor-Assisted Suicide]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== After Baxter ==
Since the Montana Supreme Court chose only to rule on statutory grounds, groups opposed to medical aid in dying have since tried to overturn the decision at the legislature. Likewise proponents of aid in dying have sought to have the detailed provisions found in other states codified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/15/a-montana-doctor-defends-physician-assisted-suicide/|title=In Montana, New Controversy Over Physician-Assisted Suicide|last=Span|first=Paula|newspaper=The New Old Age Blog|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Montana Doctor Eric Kress, M.D. became the first physician to speak publicly about providing aid in dying for qualified patients who request the medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/15/a-montana-doctor-defends-physician-assisted-suicide/|title=In Montana, New Controversy Over Physician-Assisted Suicide|last=Span|first=Paula|newspaper=The New Old Age Blog|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;And in 2015 Erwin Byrnes became the first patient to speak publicly about his plans to take the medication, saying “We have to be kind of the driver of our own bus.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://missoulian.com/news/local/longtime-missoula-educator-erwin-byrnes-charted-his-own-course-even/article_8ad9a87e-b093-11e3-b020-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Longtime Missoula educator Erwin Byrnes charted his own course, even in death|last=Briggeman|first=Kim|newspaper=missoulian.com|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 The Journal of Palliative Medicine published Clinical Criteria for Physician Aid in Dying for doctors to use as guidance in states like Montana, where provisions are not detailed in statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orentlicher|first=David|last2=Pope|first2=Thaddeus Mason|last3=Rich|first3=Ben A.|last4=Committee|first4=Physician Aid-in-Dying Clinical Criteria|title=Clinical Criteria for Physician Aid in Dying|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/jpm.2015.0092|journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine|volume=19|issue=3|pages=259–262|doi=10.1089/jpm.2015.0092|pmc=4779271|pmid=26539979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Book of business''' is common parlance in the United States legal services sector and refers to the collection of clients that a [[lawyer]] (usually a partner) has assembled throughout his or her career. It is often used to refer to the valuation of such client following.{{Clarify|date=June 2014}}

Since most U.S. [[law firm]]s are organized as [[limited liability partnerships]] or [[professional corporation]]s, each partner is usually responsible for cultivating his or her own clients in that partner's specific area of focus, e.g. [[litigation]], [[tax]] or [[securities]]. In the competitive legal market, especially in large city markets, partners are evaluated by committees of their fellow partners with assistance of non-legal market and financial professionals both in-house and outside the firm on a yearly basis and set guidelines on billable targets. An [[equity partner]] with a stagnant or declining book of business can be "de-equitized" or demoted from the status of a partner who receives a share of the firm's profits to that of a salaried partner or counsel.

Firms seeking to expand often retain outside legal recruiters and specify the minimum book of business they require for a lateral candidate, usually between $1–$3 million in larger legal markets. When a partner resigns from his or her law firm, [[American Bar Association]] and local bar rules require his or her clients to be notified, giving them a chance to decide whether to follow the lawyer to the new firm, or stay. Given the fierce competition among law firms in the past 20 years, anecdotal reports suggest that partners are informing their clients before handing in their resignations to determine how much of their business is portable.

A [[conflict of interest]] check is also an important step before a book of business can be considered portable.  For example, a partner whose primary clients are insurance policyholders would generally be unable to take most of his book of business to a firm that represents insurers.

{{globalize|date=March 2013}}&lt;!--This is an offence in Canada as well.--&gt;
'''Causing death by dangerous driving''' is a [[statutory]] offence in [[English law|England and Wales]], [[Scots law|Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland law|Northern Ireland]]. It is an aggravated form of [[dangerous driving]]. It is currently created by section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Act 1988]] (as substituted by the [[Road Traffic Act 1991]]).

==Statute==
[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/1 Section 1] of the [[Road Traffic Act 1988]] (as substituted by section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Act 1991]]&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Road+Traffic+Act+1991&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1806808&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1806813&amp;filesize=6993 Section 1] Road Traffic Act 1991&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;), creates the offences of causing death by dangerous driving:

{{cquote|A person who causes the death of another person by driving a mechanically propelled vehicle dangerously on a road or other public place is guilty of an offence.}}

==="Dangerously"===
See [[Dangerous driving#"Dangerously"]]

==Mode of trial==
Causing death by dangerous driving is an [[indictable-only offence]].

==Sentencing==
A person convicted of causing death by dangerous driving is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988]], Part I of Schedule 2 (as amended by the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/section/285 section 285(3)])&lt;/ref&gt; Disqualification for a minimum of two years is obligatory on conviction.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988]], sections [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/53/section/34 34(1) and (4)] and Part I of Schedule 2&lt;/ref&gt; Endorsement is obligatory on conviction.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/53/section/44 section 44] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/53/schedule/2/part/I Part I] of Schedule 2&lt;/ref&gt;  The offence carries three to eleven [[penalty points]] (when the defendant is exceptionally not disqualified).&lt;ref&gt;The [[Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988]],[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/53/section/28 section 28] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/53/schedule/2/part/I Part I] of Schedule 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Court of Appeal]] in R v Cooksley and others&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2003/996.html Cooksley &amp; Anor v R] [2003] EWCA Crim 996 (3 April 2003)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; gave guidelines for cases where death is caused by dangerous driving.  In R v Richardson&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2006/3186.html Richardson &amp; Ors, R v] [2006] EWCA Crim 3186 (18 December 2006)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Appeal]] reassessed the starting point set out in R v Cooksley taking into consideration the increase in the maximum penalty. The relevant starting points identified in Cooksley should be reassessed as follows: 
:i) No aggravating circumstances – twelve months to two years' imprisonment (previously 18 months); 
:ii) Intermediate culpability - two to four and a half years' imprisonment (previously 3 years); 
:iii) Higher culpability – four and a half to seven years' imprisonment (previously 5 years); 
:iv) Most serious culpability – seven to fourteen years' imprisonment (previous starting point of 6 years).

When a court disqualifies a person on conviction for causing death by dangerous driving, it must order an extended retest.

===History===
Part I of Schedule 2 to the [[Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988]] originally provided that a person convicted of this offence was liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. It was amended by section 67(1) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1993]] on 16 August 1993&lt;ref&gt;England and Wales: S.I. 1993/1968, art. 2(1) &amp; Sch.1; Scotland: S.I. 1993/2035, art. 2(1)&lt;/ref&gt; so as to increase the maximum term to ten years.

==New offences==
The [[Road Safety Act 2006]] introduced two new offences, of "causing death by careless, or inconsiderate driving" and a distinct offence for causing (any) death by driving when unlicensed, or disqualified.

==History==
This offence was formerly created by section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Act 1972]]. But it was abolished by section 50 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]].

==Equivalents in other countries==

===Australia (not including overseas dependencies)===

In New South Wales and Western Australia, "Dangerous driving occasioning death" is an equivalent to "Causing death by dangerous driving".

The person's driving privileges, in Western Australia, will be [http://www.australiancriminallawyers.com.au/web/page/wa_dangerous_driving_causing_death_s.59_of_the_road_traffic_act_law_states: suspended for at least 2 years]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, from the date of conviction.  Should any of the following "Circumstances of aggravation" be proven, in a trial for dangerous driving occasioning death, it is possible for the driver to receive a prison sentence of up to and including 20 years:
*driver was unlawfully driving the motor vehicle concerned without the consent of the owner or person in charge (an equivalent to [[TWOC#Aggravated taking|aggravated TWOC]]);
*driver was driving more than 45&amp;nbsp;km/h (28&amp;nbsp;mph) over the speed limit; or
*person was driving the vehicle to escape pursuit by the police

If a defendant is tried in District Court for dangerous driving occasioning death, but none of the circumstances of aggravation can be proven, the maximum imprisonment is 10 years.  A conviction in Magistrates Court can result in imprisonment of up to and including 3 years.

In NSW, the maximum term of imprisonment, for a [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s52a.html conviction of dangerous driving occasioning death], is:
*14 years, if:
**the person's blood alcohol content was 0.15 or more;
**the person drove the vehicle at 45 or more km/h over the posted speed limit;
**the person drove the vehicle to escape the police; or
**the person drove under the influence of drugs or a combination of drink and drugs
*10 years, if none of the above circumstances of aggravation was present at the time of the offence

The equivalent, in Queensland, to "Causing death by dangerous driving", is "[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/cc189994/s328a.html Dangerous operation of a vehicle causing death]".  Under Section 328A of the Queensland Criminal Code, the maximum penalties, for this offence, are:
*14 years, if the driver:
**operated the vehicle at more than 40&amp;nbsp;km/h (25&amp;nbsp;mph) over the posted speed limit
**was under the influence of drink or drugs
**knew or ought to have known, that bodily harm or death resulted, and the death of the victim so results, but nonetheless failed to remain at the scene of the collision, "other than to obtain medical or other help for the other person, before a police officer arrives"
*10 years, if none of the above circumstances of aggravation is present

Driving disqualifications handed down by Australian courts, whether inside or outside Queensland, will result in the [http://www.qld.gov.au/transport/licensing/driver-licensing/overseas/driving/index.html suspension of Queensland driving privileges].  Disqualifications for dangerous operation of a vehicle causing death are included.

===Canada===

In Canada, the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] has several road traffic offences equivalent to causing death by dangerous driving.  The basic offence, "[[Wikibooks:Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Offences/Dangerous Operation of a Motor Vehicle|Dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death]]", has a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment.  If the driver is convicted of failing to stop for police, criminal negligence, street racing, a hit and run or drink-driving, in addition to dangerous driving, and a death resulted, the maximum penalty is [[Life imprisonment in Canada|life imprisonment]]. 
 
A person's Canada-wide driving privileges will be suspended, for any Criminal Code driving conviction, although lengths of suspensions vary by province and territory.  In some cases, a driver's licence can be taken away permanently after a certain number of Criminal Code driving convictions, as in the province of Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/driver/handbook/section4.8.10.shtml Ontario Ministry of Transportation:  "Other Ways to Lose your Licence"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some provinces and American states have agreements to mutually recognize road traffic offences that occur out-of-province or out-of-state.  Traffic violations that occur in Michigan and New York for vehicular homicide are counted, for licence suspension purposes, on a person's Ontario driving record.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ontario.ca/faq/what-happens-if-i-get-out-province-demerit-points Ontario:  "What happens if I get out-of-province demerit points?"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Vehicular homicide convictions in Maine and New York are counted on a driver's Quebec driving record (see also "United States" above).

===Ireland (Republic)===

An equivalent, under [[Republic of Ireland]] traffic laws, to causing death by dangerous driving, is "Dangerous driving causing death".  The [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0025/sec0069.html#sec69 maximum period of imprisonment, for such a conviction, is 10 years].  The [http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driving_offences/driving_offences.html minimum licence suspension is 5 years].  The UK and Republic of Ireland are parties to the 1998 EU Convention on Driving Disqualifications (98/C 216/01) and therefore convictions for dangerous driving causing death in the UK are counted on a person's Republic of Ireland driving record.

===United States (not including overseas dependencies)===

In many [[U.S. state|American states]], [[vehicular homicide]] is an equivalent to causing death by dangerous driving.  Maximum prison sentences and licence suspension lengths vary by state.

Vehicular homicide, under the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, is often classified as a "[http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/registration-licensing/cdl/cdl.htm major violation]", with the following minimum CDL suspensions applicable country-wide:
* for a 1st conviction: 3-year suspension from operating commercial motor vehicles designed to transport hazardous materials; otherwise, 1 year
* for a 2nd conviction: lifetime, although 10 years if a state allows CDL privileges to be reinstated

Some states, such as [http://www.flhsmv.gov/ddl/faqsuspend.html#11 Florida] and [http://www.dmv.virginia.gov/drivers/#points_assess.asp Virginia], count out-of-state traffic violations, so long as they occurred anywhere else in the United States, the same as traffic violations that occurred in the state in which the driver was licensed.  Vehicular homicide convictions are included.

Other states, such as [http://dmv.ny.gov/tickets/about-nys-driver-point-system New York] and [http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=%2F%2FC_24_2%2FC24_2R20_A.htm Maine], count some traffic violations that occur in Canada, the same as if those violations had occurred in those states.  Vehicular homicide convictions are included.  Permanent revocation of driving privileges is possible, particularly for holders of driving licences issued in [http://www.ncdot.gov/dmv/driver/license/violation/ North Carolina] or [http://dmv.ny.gov/tickets/penalties-multiple-offenders New York], after a vehicular homicide conviction.

'''''City of Boerne v. Flores''''', 521 U.S. 507 (1997), was a US Supreme Court case concerning the scope of [[US Congress|Congress's]] [[congressional power of enforcement|enforcement power]] under Section 5 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The case also had a significant impact on [[historic preservation]].

==Facts==
The basis for dispute arose when the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio|San Antonio]], [[Patrick Flores]], applied for a building permit to enlarge his 1923 mission-style St. Peter's Church in [[Boerne, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Julia. "U.S. Supreme Court Declares RFRA Unconstitutional in Texas Religious Landmarking Case," Preservation Law Reporter (PLR) 16, p. 1053&lt;/ref&gt; The building was located in a historic district and considered a [[contributing property]]. Local zoning authorities denied the permit, citing an ordinance governing additions and new construction in a historic district. The Archbishop brought suit, challenging the ruling under the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA) of 1993. Flores argued that his congregation had outgrown the existing structure, rendering the ruling a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion without a compelling state interest.&lt;ref name="PLR 16, p.1053"&gt;PLR 16, p.1053&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious Freedom Restoration Act==
RFRA had been crafted as a direct response to the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Employment Division v. Smith|link=|volume=494|page=872|pin=|year=1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; when the Court had upheld, against a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] challenge, an [[Oregon]] law criminalizing [[peyote]] use, which was used in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] religious rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro, Tony. ''Illustrated Great Decisions of the Supreme Court''. Washington D.C.: CQ Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The State of Oregon won on the basis that the drug laws were "non-discriminatory laws of general applicability."&lt;ref&gt;Minan, John H. "Historic Preservation and Religious Uses," 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious groups became concerned that this case would be cited as precedent for further regulation of common religious practices and lobbied Congress for legislative protection.&lt;ref name="Mauro, Tony. p.38"&gt;Mauro, Tony. p.38&lt;/ref&gt; RFRA provided a [[strict scrutiny]] standard, requiring narrowly tailored regulation serving a compelling government interest in any case substantially burdening the free exercise of religion, regardless of the intent and general applicability of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Minan, John H.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Elizabeth C. |last=Williamson |title=''City of Boerne v. Flores'' and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act: The Delicate Balance Between Religious Freedom and Historic Preservation |journal=[[Journal of Land Use and Environmental Law]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=107–159 |doi= |issn=0892-4880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RFRA applies to all laws passed by Congress prior to its enactment and to all future laws that are not explicitly exempted.(42 U.S. Code § 2000bb–3) Congress' power to do so was not challenged. Congress also applied the law to state and local governments, the City of Boerne in this case, relying on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], particularly Section 5: "The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article."

==Result==

===District Court===
The City of Boerne was successful at the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas]]; the judge struck down the RFRA as unconstitutional. Flores appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], which found the RFRA constitutional and reversed the District Court's decision. Boerne filed a ''[[certiorari]]'' petition to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Mauro, Tony. p.38"/&gt; The National Trust for Historic Preservation, among other preservation organizations, filed briefs in support of Boerne.&lt;ref name="PLR 16, p.1053"/&gt;

===Supreme Court===
The Court, in an opinion by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], struck down RFRA as it applies to the states as an unconstitutional use of Congress's enforcement powers. The Court held that it holds the sole power to define the substantive rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment&amp;mdash;a definition to which Congress may not add and from which it may not subtract. Congress could not constitutionally enact RFRA because the law was not designed to have "congruence and proportionality" with the substantive rights that the Court had defined. Although Congress could enact "remedial" or "prophylactic" legislation to guarantee rights not exactly congruent with those defined by the Court, it could only do so in order to more effectively prevent, deter, or correct violations of those rights actually guaranteed by the Court. RFRA was seen disproportionate in its effects compared to its objective. Justice Kennedy wrote:
{{quote|Congress' power under § 5, however, extends only to "enforc[ing]" the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court has described this power as "remedial." The design of the Amendment and the text of § 5 are inconsistent with the suggestion that Congress has the power to decree the substance of the Fourteenth Amendment's restrictions on the States. Legislation which alters the meaning of the Free Exercise Clause cannot be said to be enforcing the Clause. Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is. It has been given the power "to enforce," not the power to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation. Were it not so, what Congress would be enforcing would no longer be, in any meaningful sense, the "provisions of [the Fourteenth Amendment]." (citations omitted)}}

Moreover, remedial or prophylactic legislation ''still'' had to show "congruence and proportionality" between the end it aimed to reach (that is, the violations it aimed to correct), and the means it chose to reach those ends&amp;mdash;that is, the penalties or prohibitions it enacted to prevent or correct those violations. Because RFRA was not reasonably remedial or prophylactic, it was unconstitutional.

==Implications==

===Congruence and proportionality===
''Boerne'' is important for several reasons. One reason is that it introduced a completely new test for deciding whether Congress had exceeded its section-five powers: the "congruence and proportionality" test, a test that has proven to have great importance in the context of the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]]. Another reason was that it explicitly declared that the Court alone has the ability to state which rights are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Yet another was that it had First Amendment consequences too, in that it spelled the end for any legislative attempts to overturn ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]''.

The "congruence and proportionality" requirement replaced the previous theory advanced in ''[[Katzenbach v. Morgan]]'' that  the Equal Protection Clause is "a positive grant of legislative power authorizing Congress to exercise its discretion in determining the need for and nature of legislation to secure Fourteenth Amendment guarantees." Before the 1997 ''Boerne'' decision, ''Katzenbach v. Morgan'' was often interpreted as allowing Congress to go beyond, but not fall short of, the Court's interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause.
But that is not how the majority opinion in ''Boerne'' interpreted ''Katzenbach'':

{{quote|There is language in our opinion in Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966), which could be interpreted as acknowledging a power in Congress to enact legislation that expands the rights contained in § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is not a necessary interpretation, however, or even the best one....  If Congress could define its own powers by altering the Fourteenth Amendment's meaning, no longer would the Constitution be "superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means."}}

The holding of ''Boerne'' said that only the Court could interpret the Constitution, in order to maintain the "traditional separation of powers between Congress and the Judiciary." Also, ''Boerne'' relied on arguments for protecting the rights that pertain to state governments&lt;ref&gt;To support its argument that Congress lacked plenary power to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court pointed to a proposed enforcement provision which was rejected by the Congress that eventually approved the Fourteenth Amendment: 
:"Democrats and conservative Republicans argued that the proposed Amendment would give Congress a power to intrude into traditional areas of state responsibility, a power inconsistent with the federal design central to the Constitution. Typifying these views, Republican Representative Robert Hale of New York labeled the Amendment 'an utter departure from every principle ever dreamed of by the men who framed our Constitution,' and warned that under it 'all State legislation, in its codes of civil and criminal jurisprudence and procedures … may be overridden, may be repealed or abolished, and the law of Congress established instead.'  Senator William Stewart of Nevada likewise stated the Amendment would permit 'Congress to legislate fully upon all subjects affecting life, liberty, and property,' such that 'there would not be much left for the State Legislatures,' and would thereby 'work an entire change in our form of government.'"
521 U.S. at 521 (citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; based on "enumerated powers." The intent of ''Boerne'' was to prevent "a considerable congressional intrusion into the States' traditional prerogatives and general authority." The holding of ''Boerne'' specifically mentioned the state action doctrine of the ''Civil Rights Cases'' as a Court interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause that limits the "remedial or preventive" power of Congress.

===Constitutionality of the RFRA===
This case has been used to claim that the federal RFRA is "unconstitutional".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Napolitano | first=Andrew | title=Indiana and the Constitution | url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/02/indiana-and-constitution/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitutionality of one aspect of RFRA as applied to the federal government was confirmed on February 21, 2006, as the Supreme Court ruled against the government in ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal]]'', {{Ussc|546|418|2006}}, which involved the use of an otherwise illegal substance in a religious ceremony, stating that the federal government must show a compelling state interest in restricting religious conduct.

===Historic preservation===
The Supreme Court's decision in ''City of Boerne'' made a significant impact on the states' abilities to enforce laws, including those pertaining to historic preservation. Under RFRA, an otherwise neutral state law&amp;mdash;such as zoning, or historic preservation ordinances&amp;mdash;needed to be scrutinized if its enforcement involved a religious group or individual. Therefore, by declaring extension of RFRA to apply against state laws unconstitutional, the ability of the states to establish and maintain historic preservation ordinances was made easier.&lt;ref&gt;PLR 16, p. 1052.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in 2000, Congress enacted the [[Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act]], in which it used the [[Spending Clause]] to require, for localities that receive federal funding, land use laws to accommodate religious freedom, essentially, as if RFRA had been ruled applicable to state law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35748">This is a '''comparison of published [[free software license]]s and [[open-source license]]s'''. The comparison only covers [[software license]]s with a linked article for details, approved by at least one expert group at the [[Free Software Foundation|FSF]], the [[Open Source Initiative|OSI]], the [[Debian Project|Debian]] project or the [[Fedora Project|Fedora]] project. For a list of licenses not specifically intended for software, see [[List of free content licenses]].

==FOSS licenses==
[[FOSS]] stands for "Free and Open Source Software". There is no one universally agreed-upon definition of [[FOSS]] software and various groups maintain approved lists of licenses. The [[Open Source Initiative]] (OSI) is one such organization keeping a list of open-source licenses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical Open source licenses - Licenses by Name] on opensource.org&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) maintains a list of what it considers free.&lt;ref name="fsf_licenses"&gt;{{cite web |title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them| url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html | accessdate=August 8, 2011|website=Free Software Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSF's [[free software license|free software]] and OSI's [[open-source license|open-source]] licenses together are called [[free and open-source software|FOSS]] licenses. There are licenses accepted by the OSI which are not free as per the [[free software definition]]. The [[open source definition]] allows for further restrictions like price, type of contribution and origin of the contribution, e.g. the case of the NASA Open Source Agreement, which requires the code to be "original" work.&lt;ref name="fsf_nasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#NASA|title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them: NASA Open Source Agreement|website=Free Software Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="osi_licenses"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical|website=Open Source Initiative|title=Licenses by Name}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OSI does not endorse FSF license analysis (interpretation) as per their disclaimer.&lt;ref name="osi_disclaimer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://opensource.org/node/778|title=Other Resources &amp; Disclaimer|website=Open Source Initiative|quote=''While the OSI acknowledges these as potentially helpful resources for the community, it does not endorse any content, contributors or license interpretations from these websites.[...]The OSI does not promote or exclusively favor any of the above resources, but instead mentions them as a neutral, separate third-party.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSF's [[Free Software]] definition focuses on the user's unrestricted rights to use a ''program'', to study and modify it, to copy it, and redistribute it for any purpose, which are considered by the FSF the ''four essential freedoms''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html "Relationship between the Free Software movement and Open Source movement"], Free Software Foundation, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html "What is Free Software"], Free Software Foundation, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;The OSI's [[open-source|open-]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[open-source|source]] criteria focuses on the availability of the ''[[source code]]'' and the advantages of an unrestricted and community driven development model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://opensource.org/about opensource.org/about] ''"Open source is a development method for software that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process. The promise of open source is better quality, higher reliability, more flexibility, lower cost, and an end to predatory vendor lock-in."''&lt;/ref&gt;Yet, many FOSS licenses, like the Apache license, and all Free Software licenses allow commercial use of FOSS components.&lt;ref name="Popp2"&gt;{{cite book | first = Dr. Karl Michael | last = Popp | title = Best Practices for commercial use of open source software | year = 2015 | publisher = Books on Demand | location = Norderstedt, Germany | isbn = 978-3738619096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approvals==
This table lists for each license what organizations from the [[FOSS]] community have approved it{{spaced ndash}}be it as a "free software" or as an "open source" license{{spaced ndash}}, how those organizations categorize it, and the [[license compatibility]] between them for a combined or mixed derivative work. Organizations usually approve specific versions of software licenses. For instance, a FSF approval means that the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) considers a license to be [[free software license]]. The FSF recommends at least "[[GPL compatibility|Compatible with GPL]]" and preferably [[copyleft]]. The OSI recommends a mix of [[Permissive license|permissive]] and copyleft licenses, the [[Apache License 2.0]], 2- &amp; 3-clause [[BSD license]], [[GPL]], [[LGPL]], [[MIT license]], [[Mozilla Public License|MPL]] 2.0, [[Common Development and Distribution License|CDDL]] and [[Eclipse Public License|EPL]].

The '''Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings''' is a regional [[human rights]] [[treaty]] of [[international human rights law]] by the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/197.htm |title=Council of Europe - Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CETS No. 197) |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention aims to: 
* prevent and combat all forms of [[trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]], including, but not limited to [[Sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]] and [[forced labour]], whether national or transnational, whether or not connected with organised crime;
* to protect and assist victims and witnesses of trafficking;
* to ensure effective investigation and prosecution, and
* to promote international co-operation against trafficking. 

In particular, the Convention requires national co-ordination measures, [[awareness raising]], measures to identify and support victims and a "recovery and reflection period" during which trafficked persons will not be expelled from the receiving state.

The Convention establishes a monitoring mechanism (the Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, or GRETA) consisting of 10 to 15 members elected by the states parties.

The Convention opened for signature on 16 May 2005, and entered into force on 1 February 2008. As of June 2017, it has been ratified by 47 European states. Every state in the [[Council of Europe]] has ratified the treaty except the [[Russia]]n Federation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/197/signatures?p_auth=Gn9RcCwG &lt;/ref&gt;[[Belarus]], a non–Council of Europe state, acceded to the convention in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/197/signatures?p_auth=Gn9RcCwG&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dividend imputation''' is a [[corporate tax]] system in which some or all of the tax paid by a company may be attributed, or [[imputation (economics)|imputed]], to the shareholders by way of a [[tax credit]] to reduce the income tax payable on a distribution. In comparison to the classical system, it reduces or eliminates the tax disadvantages of distributing dividends to shareholders by only requiring them to pay the difference between the corporate rate and their marginal rate.

[[Australia]], [[Malta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://acumum.com/publications/library/|publisher=Legal Library of Malta Laws|title=Tax Laws of Malta}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Taxation in New Zealand|New Zealand]] have imputation systems. [[Chile]], [[Canada]], [[Korea]] and the [[United Kingdom corporation tax|United Kingdom]] have a partial imputation system.&lt;ref&gt;The Australia Institute, [http://www.tai.org.au/sites/defualt/files/dividend%20imputation%20docx.pdf How the government loses 48 per cent of company tax: Dividend imputation and franking credits] by David Richardson&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Taxation in Germany|Germany]] had a dividend imputation system until 2000 and [[Taxation in France|France]] until 2004. Other jurisdictions (Singapore, for example) achieve a similar result by not taxing dividends at all. The difference under this arrangement is that shareholders obtain a tax benefit even though the company may not have paid any tax at the corporate level, and it also benefits non-resident shareholders. The imputation system effectively taxes the company profit at the shareholders' average tax rates.

The objective of the dividend imputation system is to eliminate [[double taxation]] of company profits, once at the corporate level and again on distribution as dividend to shareholders. More specifically, it is intended to create a "[[level playing field]]" by taxing the same activity in the same way, irrespective of the business structure being used, namely a company or trust, [[sole trader]] or [[partnership]].

== Australia ==
{{main|Australian dividend imputation system}}
The Australian tax system allows companies to determine the proportion of '''franking credits''' to attach to the [[dividend]]s paid.  A franking credit is a nominal unit of tax paid by [[companies]] using dividend imputation. Franking credits are passed on to [[shareholders]] along with dividends.

[[Income tax in Australia#Residency for tax purposes|Australian-resident shareholders]] include in their assessable [[income]] the '''grossed-up''' dividend amount (being the total of the dividend payable plus the associated franking credits). The [[income tax]] payable by the shareholders is calculated, and the franking credits are applied to offset the tax payable. In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] the end result is the elimination of [[double taxation]] of company profits.

===History ===
Dividend imputation was introduced in 1987, one of a number of tax reforms by the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]]–[[Paul Keating|Keating]] Labor Government.  Prior to that a company would pay company tax on its profits and if it then paid a dividend, that dividend was taxed again as income for the shareholder, i.e. a part owner of the company, a form of [[double taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;Act No. 59 of 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 the eligibility rules (below) were introduced by the [[John Howard|Howard]]–[[Peter Costello|Costello]] Liberal Government, with a $2,000 small shareholder exemption. In 1999 that exemption was raised to the present $5,000. In 2000, franking credits became fully refundable, not just reducing tax liability to zero. In 2002, preferential dividend streaming was banned. In 2003, [[New Zealand]] companies could elect to join the system for Australian tax they paid.

=== Operation ===
Say, a company makes profit of $100 and pays company tax of $30 (at 2006 rates) and records the $30 in the franking account. The $30 is paid to the tax office.

The company now has $70 left to pay a dividend, either in the same year or later years. When it does so, it may attach a franking credit from its franking account, in proportion to the tax rate. So if it pays a $70 dividend it could attach $30 of franking credits. When the dividend is paid, the franking account is debited by $30.

An eligible shareholder receiving a franked dividend declares the cash amount plus the franking credit as income, and is credited with the franking credit against their final tax bill. The effect is as if the tax office reversed the company tax by giving back the $30 to the shareholder and had them treat the original $100 of profit as income, in the shareholder's hands, like the company was merely a conduit.

Thus company profits going to eligible shareholders are taxed just once. Profits are either retained by the company and taxed there at the corporate rate, or paid out later as dividends and instead they're taxed at the shareholder's rate.

Dividends may still be paid by a company when it has no franking credits (perhaps because it has been making tax losses), this is called an ''unfranked dividend''. Or it may pay a franked portion and an unfranked portion, known as ''partly franked''. An unfranked dividend (or the unfranked portion) is [[ordinary income]] in the hands of the shareholder.

=== Refund ===
A franking credit on dividends received after 1 July 2000 are refundable [[tax credit]]s. It is a form of tax paid, which can reduce a taxpayer's total tax liability, and any excess is refunded. For example, an individual with income below the [[tax-free threshold]] ($18,200 since 2011/12) pays no tax at all and can get the franking credits back in full, after a tax return is lodged.

Prior to 1 July 2000 such excess franking credits were lost. For example, an individual at that time paying no tax would get nothing back, they merely kept the cash part of the dividend received.

=== Investors ===

The easiest way for an investor to value a franked dividend is to think of the franking credit as part of the income they receive.  The investor doesn't get it in cash, only as a kind of [[IOU (debt)|IOU]] from the tax office, but nonetheless it and the cash portion make up pre-tax income.  Thus a franked dividend of $0.70 plus $0.30 credit is exactly equivalent to an unfranked dividend of $1.00, or to bank [[interest]] of $1.00, or any other ordinary income of that amount.  (It's exactly equivalent because franking is fully refundable, as described above.)

Franked dividends are often described as a "tax effective" form of income.  The basis for this is that the cash $0.70 looks like it's taxed at a lower rate than other income.  For example, for an individual on the top rate of 48.5% (for 2006) the calculation is $0.70 plus $0.30 credit is $1.00 on which $0.485 tax is payable, but less the $0.30 credit makes $0.185 net tax, which is just 26.4% of the original $0.70.  Conversely, an individual on the 20% marginal tax rate actually gets a $0.10 rebate.  In this latter case, the rebate looks very much like negative tax.

There's nothing inherently wrong with the latter way of thinking about franked dividends, and it is frequently made to demonstrate how franking benefits the investor, but it can be argued a grossing-up like the former is better when comparing yields across different investment opportunities.

=== Eligibility ===

There are restrictions on who can use franking credits.  Those who cannot must simply declare as income the cash dividend amount they receive. The restrictions are designed to prevent the trading of franking credits between different taxpayers.  An eligible shareholder is one who either

* Owns the shares for a continuous period of 45 days or more (not counting purchase and sale days); or 90 days in the case of certain [[preferred stock|preference share]]s.  This is the "holding period rule".  Shares must be "at risk" for the necessary period, i.e. not with an offsetting [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s position for instance.

Or who

* Has total franking credits for the tax year of less than $5000 (the "small shareholder exemption") and has not arranged to pass-on the benefits to someone else (the "related payments rule").

Thus franking credits are not available to short-term traders, only to longer term holders, but with small holders exempted provided it's for their own benefit.

The small shareholder exemption is not a "first $5000", but rather once the $5000 threshold is passed the rule is inoperative and all one's shares are under the holding period rule.

For the holding period rule, parcels of shares bought and sold at different times are reckoned on a "first in, last out" basis.  Each sale is taken to be of the most recently purchased shares.  This prevents a taxpayer buying just before a dividend, selling just after, and asserting it was older shares sold (to try to fulfill the holding period).

This "first in, last out" reckoning may be contrasted with [[capital gains tax]].  For capital gains the shareholder can nominate what parcel was sold from among those bought at different times.

=== Company shareholders ===
A dividend received by a company shareholder is income of the receiving company, but the dividend income is not grossed-up for the franking credit nor is the receiving company entitled to claim the franking credit as a tax credit. Instead, the franking credit is added directly to the receiving company's franking account, and can be paid out in the same way as franking credits generated by the receiving company.

This transfer of credits has made the previous "intercorporate rebates" allowances redundant.  Those rebates had avoided double taxation on dividends paid from one company to another company. Those rebates were part of the original 1936 Taxation Act (section 46), meaning that the principle of eliminating double taxation has been present to some degree in Australian income tax law for a very long time.

The company tax rate has changed a few times since the introduction of dividend imputation. In each case transitional rules have been made to maintain the principle of reversing the original tax paid, even if the tax rate has changed. This has been either by separate franking accounts for separate rates (e.g. class A 39%, class B 33%), or making an adjusting recalculation of the credits (e.g. into class C 30%).

=== Trans-Tasman Imputation ===

[[New Zealand]] companies can apply to join the Australian dividend imputation system (from 2003).  Doing so allows them to attach Australian franking credits to their dividends, for Australian tax they have paid.  Those credits can then be used by shareholders who are Australian taxpayers, the same as dividends from an Australian company.

There are certain anti-tax-avoidance rules to prevent New Zealand companies deliberately streaming Australian franking credits towards their Australian shareholders; credits must be distributed on a pro-rata basis.

Note that it is only Australian franking credits which can be used by an Australian taxpayer.  New Zealand imputation credits on dividends paid to an Australian shareholder cannot be used against that shareholder's Australian taxes.

=== Abuses of the system ===

A company is not obliged to attach franking credits to its dividends.  But it costs the company nothing to do so, and the credits will benefit eligible shareholders, so it is usual to attach the maximum available.  It's actually possible for a company to attach more than it has, but doing so attracts tax penalties that mean this is not worthwhile.

In the past it was permissible for corporations to direct the flow of franking credits preferentially to one type of shareholder over another so that each may benefit the most as fits their tax circumstances.  For example, foreign shareholders cannot use franking credits (they can't be offset against [[withholding tax]]) but Australian shareholders can.  This practice, known as ''dividend streaming'', became illegal in 2002, whereafter all dividends within a given time frame must now be franked to a similar (but need not be identical) degree irrespective of shareholder location or which class of shares held.

=== Effective elimination of company tax and thus incentives ===
To a large extent, dividend imputation makes company tax irrelevant.  This is because every dollar that a company pays in company tax can be claimed by the shareholder as franking credit, with no net revenue flowing to the government.  (There are exceptions which include profits retained by the company that are never paid as dividends, and payments to international investors.)

When gross company tax is reported by Treasury, it is unclear whether the number generally includes the effect of the corresponding franking credits.

One effect is that this has reduced the effectiveness of tax [[incentives]] for corporations. If a corporation was given a tax break then its incomes thus released from taxation would not generate franking credits precisely because no tax was paid. In turn, this meant that the shareholders received fewer credits along with their dividends, meaning in turn that they had to pay more tax.

The net result is that each tax break a corporation itself got was countered by a matching increase in the tax burden of shareholders, leaving shareholders in exactly the same position had no tax break been received by the corporation. Thus, to the extent that corporate directors acted so as to [[increase shareholder wealth]], tax incentives would not influence [[corporate behaviour]].

== New Zealand ==

New Zealand introduced a dividend imputation system in 1989.  It operates on similar principles to the Australian system.  A shareholder receiving a dividend from a company is entitled to an "imputation credit", which represents tax paid by the company, and is used to reduce or eliminate the shareholder's income tax liability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-200-299/ir274-guide-imputation.html NZ Inland Revenue booklet IR274] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515044035/http://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-200-299/ir274-guide-imputation.html |date=15 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
From 1973 to 1999, the UK operated an imputation system, with shareholders able to claim a tax credit reflecting [[advance corporation tax]] (ACT) paid by a company when a distribution was made. A company could set off ACT against the company's annual corporation tax liability, subject to limitations.

In 1999 ACT was abolished. Shareholders receiving a dividend were still entitled to a tax credit to offset their tax liability, but the tax credit no longer necessarily represented tax paid by the company, and could not be refunded to the shareholder. The tax credit was abolished as of 6 April 2016 and replaced with a tax-free dividend allowance of £5,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dividend-allowance-factsheet/dividend-allowance-factsheet HM Revenue &amp; Customs Policy paper: Dividend Allowance factsheet] &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eliminationism''' is the belief that one's political opponents are "a [[cancer]] on the body politic that must be excised—either by separation from the public at large, through [[censorship]] or by outright [[mass murder|extermination]]—in order to protect the purity of the nation".&lt;ref name="Bernard 2009"&gt;{{cite paper| last = Bernard | first = Phyllis E. | title = Eliminationist Discourse In A Conflicted Society: Lessons For America From Africa? | date = June 12, 2009 | url = http://epublications.marquette.edu/mulr/vol93/iss1/12/ |accessdate = 2009-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''eliminationism'' was coined by American political scientist [[Daniel Goldhagen]] in his 1996 book ''[[Hitler's Willing Executioners]]'' in which he posits that ordinary [[Germans]] not only knew about, but also supported, the [[Holocaust]] because of a unique and virulent "eliminationist antisemitism" in the German identity, which had developed in the preceding centuries.&lt;ref name="Bernard 2009"/&gt;

==Effects==
In his 2009 book ''Worse Than War: Genocide, Eliminationism, and the Ongoing Assault on Humanity'', Goldhagen argues that eliminationism is the root cause of every [[mass murder]] perpetrated in the 20th and 21st centuries, including:&lt;ref name="Gray 2009"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Gray, John | title = Worse Than War: Genocide, Eliminationism and the Ongoing Assault on Humanity By Daniel Jonah Goldhagen | date = 4 February 2010 | url = http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2010/02/genocide-goldhagen-mass | accessdate = 2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American journalist [[David Neiwert]] argued in 2009 that eliminationist rhetoric is becoming increasingly mainstream within the [[Conservatism in the United States|American right wing]], fueled in large part by the extremist discourse found on conservative [[blog]]s and [[talk radio]], which may provoke a resurgence of [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf terrorism]].&lt;ref name="Holland 2009"&gt;{{cite paper|author=Holland, Joshua |title=The Terrorist Threat: Right-Wing Radicals and the Eliminationist Mindset |date=12 June 2009 |url=http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/140578 |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723075225/http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/140578 |archivedate=2009-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernard argues that interventions in [[Rwanda]] and [[Nigeria]], which adapted American dispute prevention and [[dispute resolution|resolution]] methods to African media and dispute resolution traditions, may provide a better fit and forum for the U.S. to address eliminationist media messages and their impact on society.&lt;ref name="Bernard 2009"/&gt;

[[Theodore N. Kaufman]] self-published ''[[Germany Must Perish!]]'' in the United States in 1941. In the 104-page book, Kaufman advocated genocide through [[forced sterilization]] of all [[Germans]] and the territorial disassociation of [[Germany]]. The obscure book received very little attention in the US, but was eventually cited by the [[Nazi]] regime as proof of a vast [[Jew]]ish [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|conspiracy]] to annihilate Germany and Germans (Kaufman was a Jew). The Nazis published quotes from the book in wartime [[propaganda]], pretending that the book was indicative of the views of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], which in turn was added justification for Nazi Germany's continued persecution of the Jews as part of the [[Holocaust]].

During the 1991–2002 [[Algerian Civil War]] the predominant faction of the conflict's first phase was known as ''[[les éradicateurs]]'' for their ideology and for their rural and urban tactics. These hardliners were opposed in the [[People's National Army (Algeria)|Army]] and the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] by ''[[les dialoguistes]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8559">'''Entitlement theory''' is a theory of [[distributive justice]] and [[private property]] created by [[Robert Nozick]] in his book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]''. The theory is Nozick's attempt to describe "justice in holdings" (Nozick 1974:150)—or what can be said about and done with the property people own when viewed from a principle of justice.

== Principles ==
Nozick's entitlement theory comprises three main principles:

# '''A principle of justice in acquisition''' – This principle deals with the initial acquisition of holdings. It is an account of how people first come to own unowned and natural world  property, what types of things can be held, and so forth.
# '''A principle of justice in transfer''' – This principle explains how one person can acquire holdings from another, including voluntary exchange and gifts.
# '''A principle of rectification of injustice''' – how to deal with holdings that are unjustly acquired or transferred, whether and how much victims can be compensated, how to deal with long past transgressions or injustices done by a government, and so on.

Nozick believes that if the world were wholly just, only the first two principles would be needed, as "the following inductive definition would exhaustively cover the subject of justice in holdings":

:# A person who acquires a holding in accordance with the principle of justice in acquisition is entitled to that holding.
:# A person who acquires a holding in accordance with the principle of justice in transfer, from someone else entitled to the holding, is entitled to the holding.
:#No one is entitled to a holding except by (repeated) applications of 1 and 2. (Nozick 1974:151)

Thus, entitlement theory would imply "a distribution is just if everyone is entitled to the holdings they possess under the distribution" (Nozick 1974:151).  However, not everyone follows these rules: "some people steal from others, or defraud them, or enslave them, seizing their product and preventing them from living as they choose, or forcibly exclude others from competing in exchanges" (Nozick 1974:152). Thus the third principle of rectification is needed.

Entitlement theory is based on [[John Locke]]'s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Justice in acquisition: "Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property. It being by him removed from the common state nature hath placed it in, it hath by this labour something annexed to it, that excludes the common right of other men: for this labour being the unquestionable property of the labourer, no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others." — John Locke, ''Second Treatise on Government'', Ch.5 Sec. 27

Justice in transfer: "Again, if he would give his nuts for a piece of metal, pleased with its colour; or exchange his sheep for shells, or wool for a sparkling pebble or a diamond, and keep those by him all his life he invaded not the right of others, he might heap up as much of these durable things as he pleased; the exceeding of the bounds of his just property not lying in the largeness of his possession, but the perishing of any thing uselesly in it." – John Locke, ''Second Treatise on Government'', Ch.5 Sec. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Under entitlement theory, people are represented as ends in themselves and equals, as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] claimed, though different people may own (i.e. be entitled to) different amounts of property. Nozick's ideas create a strong system of [[private property]] and a [[free-market economy]]. The only just transaction is a voluntary one. [[Taxation]] of the rich to support full robust [[social program]]s for the poor is unjust because the state is acquiring money by force instead of through a voluntary transaction.  However, Nozick's ideas can endorse the creation of a minimal social program for the poor.  Every person in the state of nature can achieve a certain level of welfare according to their own abilities.  This level of welfare, while not equal, must be maintained via the [[Lockean proviso]]. Given the justice of acquisition condition and the Lockean proviso, "It is conceivable that in the normal operation of the economy, a private property regime might at some times, for some people, fail to provide access to this level of welfare when left to itself. If so, then justice—as the libertarian understands it—demands that the state act to correct the distribution of welfare generated by the spontaneous play of market forces."&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-minimum/#2.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from other ideals==
Entitlement theory contrasts sharply with the Principles of Justice in [[John Rawls|Rawls']] ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', which states that each person has an equal claim to basic rights and liberties, and that inequality should only be permitted to the degree that such inequality is "reasonably expected to be to everyone's advantage" (Rawls 1999: 53).  There is a further provision that such inequalities are only permissible insofar as there is an equality of opportunity to benefit from these inequalities. Nozick instead argues that people who have or produce certain things have rights over them: "on an entitlement view, [production and distribution] are not ... separate questions ... things come into the world already attached to people having entitlements over them" (Nozick 1974:160). Nozick believes that unjustly taking someone's holdings violates their rights. "Holdings to which ... people are entitled may not be seized, even to provide equality of opportunity for others" (Nozick 1974:235). Thus, a system which works to reduce the rightfully earned holdings of some so that they can be equally distributed to others is immoral.

:"The major objection to speaking of everyone's having a right ''to'' various things such as equality of opportunity, life, and so on, and enforcing this right, is that these 'rights' require a substructure of things and materials and actions; and ''other'' people may have rights and entitlements over these. No one has a right to something whose realization requires certain uses of things and activities that other people have rights and entitlements over" (Nozick 1974:238).

== Criticism ==
In his later work, ''[[The Examined Life]]'', Nozick reflects that entitlement theory's defense of people's holdings may have some problems, in that it could eventually lead to the vast majority of resources being pooled in the hands of the extremely skilled, or, through gifts and inheritance, in the hands of the extremely skilled's friends and children. Nozick says

:"Bequeathing something to others is an expression of caring about them .. yet bequests [are] sometimes passed on for generations to persons unknown to the original earner, ... producing continuing inequalities of wealth and position. .. The resulting inequalities seem unfair.

:One possible solution would be to restructure an institution of inheritance so that taxes will subtract from the possessions people can bequeath the value of what they themselves have received through bequests. People then could leave to others only the amount they themselves have added.

:The simple subtraction rule does not perfectly disentangle what the next generation has managed itself to contribute—inheriting wealth may make it easier to amass more—but it is a serviceable rule of thumb" (Nozick 1989:30-31).

Furthermore, the notion of taxation being inherently unjust, and market transactions being inherently just, depends on the notion that they actually are as involuntary or voluntary as they appear: in a nation that permits free emigration of its citizens, taxation is not entirely involuntary, while market transactions for necessary goods and services can hardly be said to be entirely voluntary, and if the wealthy, or organized labor, or those in control of de facto industry standards are able to exert undue influence on such a market, they frequently skew those transactions to favor their own interests.

'''Fair dealing''' is a [[Limitations and exceptions to copyright|limitation and exception]] to the [[exclusive right]] granted by [[copyright]] law to the author of a creative work. Fair dealing is found in many of the [[common law]] jurisdictions of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

Fair dealing is an enumerated set of possible defences against an action for infringement of an [[exclusive right]] of [[copyright]]. Unlike the related [[United States]] doctrine of [[fair use]], fair dealing cannot apply to any act which does not fall within one of these categories&lt;!-- which categories? --&gt;, although [[common law]] courts in some jurisdictions are less stringent than others in this regard.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{cite web |url=http://infojustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/band-and-gerafi-2013.pdf |title=The Fair Use/Fair Dealing Handbook |work=infojustice.org |publisher=American University Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, such courts might rule that actions with a commercial character, which might be naïvely assumed to fall into one of these categories, were in fact infringements of copyright, as fair dealing is not as flexible a concept as the American concept of fair use.

Regarding fair dealing under [[Crown copyright]] the Australian ''Copyright Act'' 1968, ss.176-178. [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/s182a.html Section 182A] (inserted by Act 154 of 1980, s.23) provides that the copyright, including any prerogative right or privilege of the Crown in the nature of copyright, in Acts, Ordinances, regulations etc., and judgments of Federal or State courts and certain other tribunals, is not infringed by the making, by reprographic reproduction, of one copy of the whole or part of that work for a particular purpose (this does not apply where charge for copy exceeds cost).
{{Wikinews|Australian copyright laws to be overhauled in 2006}}
Regarding the re-use of copyrighted images or drawings, the Australian ''Copyright Act'' does not impose a 10%-limit under its fair dealing provisions ''for the purpose of research and study''. Instead, each and every such use for research or study must be evaluated individually to determine whether it is fair, similar to the notion of [[fair use]] in U.S. copyright law. Among the criteria used to determine the fairness of a use are the purpose and character of the dealing, the nature of the work, the possibility of obtaining the work commercially within a reasonable time, the effect of the use on the potential market for the work or on its value, and how much of a work is copied.

In 2006, a federal law (''Copyright Amendment Act'' 2006 (Cth) No. 158, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/caa2006213/ |title=COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT ACT 2006 (NO. 158, 2006) |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  enabled parody and satire to qualify as fair dealing under federal copyright law in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070918161318/http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/rwpattach.nsf/VAP/%28CFD7369FCAE9B8F32F341DBE097801FF%29~Copyright+Fact+Sheet+-+Parody+and+Satire.pdf/%24file/Copyright+Fact+Sheet+-+Parody+and+Satire.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendments in 2006 also added a number of other very specific and quite limited exceptions to copyright for personal use of AV material, including those popularly known as [[time shifting]] (s111)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/s111.html |title=COPYRIGHT ACT 1968 - SECT 111 Recording broadcasts for replaying at more convenient time |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[format shifting]] (s110AA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/s110aa.html |title=COPYRIGHT ACT 1968 - SECT 110AA Copying cinematograph film in different format for private use |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several government enquiries have [[History of Fair Use proposals in Australia|recommended that Australia change to a Fair Use system]] - two of the recommendations were specifically in response to the stricter copyright rules introduced as part of the [[Australia–United States Free Trade Agreement]] (AUSFTA), while the most recent two, by the [[Australian Law Reform Commission]] (ALRC) and the [[Productivity Commission]] (PC) were with reference to strengthening Australia's "digital economy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/productivity-commission-to-say-fair-use-could-get-us-ahead-and-end-the-copyright-protection-racket-20161214-gtau3u.html|title=Our copyright laws are holding us back, and there's a way out|last=Martin|first=Peter|date=2016-12-15|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=2017-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161214223301/http://www.smh.com.au/comment/productivity-commission-to-say-fair-use-could-get-us-ahead-and-end-the-copyright-protection-racket-20161214-gtau3u.html|archive-date=2016-12-14|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.org.au/content/productivity-commission-draft-ip-report-breakdown|title=Productivity Commission Draft IP Report - the breakdown|last=|first=|date=16 June 2016|website=|publisher=[[Australian Digital Alliance]]|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{See also|Fair dealing in Canadian copyright law}}
The Canadian concept of fair dealing is similar to that in the UK and Australia. The fair dealing clauses&lt;ref name="Canadian Fair Dealing Statute"&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright Act of Canada |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/C-42/page-3.html#anchorbo-ga:l_III-gb:s_29 |accessdate=7 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105194725/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/C-42/page-3.html |archivedate=5 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Canadian copyright law|Canadian ''Copyright Act'']] allow users to engage in certain activities relating to research, private study, education, parody, satire, criticism, review, or news reporting. With respect to criticism, review, and news reporting, the user must mention the source of the material, along with the name of the author, performer, maker, or broadcaster for the dealing to be fair.

Prior to 2011, fair dealing in Canada was not definitely found to contain exceptions for parody (unlike [[fair use]] in the United States), but the Copyright Act has since been amended to include parody and satire (along with educational use) under its fair dealing provisions. Previously, a Quebec Court of Appeal in ''Les productions Avanti Cine Video v. Favreau'' (4 Aug 1999) had recognized that parody could potentially be a 'critique', however it refused to recognize the exception in that circumstance.

The 2004 ruling by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''[[CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada]]'' has gone far in clarifying the concept of fair dealing in Canada. In considering fair dealing the Court makes the following general observation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is important to clarify some general considerations about exceptions to copyright infringement. Procedurally, a defendant is required to prove that his or her dealing with a work has been fair; however, the fair dealing exception is perhaps more properly understood as an integral part of the Copyright Act than simply a defence. Any act falling within the fair dealing exception will not be an infringement of copyright. The fair dealing exception, like other exceptions in the Copyright Act, is a user's right. In order to maintain the proper balance between the rights of a copyright owner and users' interests, it must not be interpreted restrictively.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, by taking "a liberal approach to the enumerated purposes of the dealing", the Court has made fair dealing more flexible, reducing the gap between this provision and US fair use&lt;ref&gt;D'Agostino, G: [http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/documents/dAgostino.pdf "Healing fair dealing? A comparative copyright analysis of Canada's fair dealing to U.K. fair dealing and U.S. fair use"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707205439/http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/documents/dAgostino.pdf |date=2012-07-07 }},'' McGill Law Journal'', 53:311-363&lt;/ref&gt;
  
It then establishes six principal criteria for evaluating fair dealing.
#'''The Purpose of the Dealing.'''  Is it for research, private study, criticism, review or news reporting (or additionally, since 2011, education, parody or satire)?  It expresses that "these allowable purposes should not be given a restrictive interpretation or this could result in the undue restriction of users' rights." In particular, the Court gave "a large and liberal interpretation" to the notion of research, stating that "lawyers carrying on the business of law for profit are conducting research".
#'''The Character of the Dealing.'''  How were the works dealt with?  Was there a single copy or were multiple copies made?  Were these copies distributed widely or to a limited group of people? Was the copy destroyed after being used?  What is the general practice in the industry?
# '''The Amount of the Dealing.''' How much of the work was used? What was the importance of the infringed work? Quoting trivial amounts may alone sufficiently establish fair dealing as there would not be copyright infringement at all. In some cases even quoting the entire work may be fair dealing.  The amount of the work taken must be fair in light of the purpose of the dealing.
# '''Alternatives to the Dealing.''' Was a "non-copyrighted equivalent of the work" available to the user? Was the dealing "reasonably necessary to achieve the ultimate purpose"?
# '''The Nature of the Work.''' Copying from a work that has never been published could be more fair than from a published work "in that its reproduction with acknowledgement could lead to a wider public dissemination of the work - one of the goals of copyright law. If, however, the work in question was confidential, this may tip the scales towards finding that the dealing was unfair."
# '''Effect of the Dealing on the Work.''' Is it likely to affect the market of the original work? "Although the effect of the dealing on the market of the copyright owner is an important factor, it is neither the only factor nor the most important factor that a court must consider in deciding if the dealing is fair."

Though the Supreme Court outlined these six criteria, it noted that in some contexts, factors other than those listed may be relevant in determining whether a particular dealing is fair.

On June 2, 2010, the [[Government of Canada]] introduced [[Bill C-32]], An Act to amend the [[Copyright Act of Canada|Copyright Act]]. A summary of the changes proposed by this bill in terms of fair dealing notes that C-32 "expands the scope of the fair dealing exception at section 29 of the Act to include new purposes: education, parody or satire".&lt;ref name="parl.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/LegislativeSummaries/bills_ls.asp?Language=E&amp;ls=C32&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=40&amp;Ses=3&amp;source=library_prb |title=Legislative Summary of Bill C-32. Parliament of Canada. Accessed October 22, 2011 |publisher=Parl.gc.ca |date=2010-07-20 |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stated aims of the revised bill were also to "permit businesses, educators and libraries to make greater use of copyright material in digital form".&lt;ref name="parl.gc.ca"/&gt; Bill C-32 had not passed by the time the minority Conservative government faced a vote of no-confidence and subsequently fell on March 25, 2011.

On September 29, 2011, the bill was re-introduced to the Forty-first Parliament as Bill C-11. With the backing of a majority Conservative government, this version of the Copyright Modernization Act has passed into law.  Simply put, the fair dealing amendment in Section 29 of Bill C-11 expands the first criteria for evaluating fair dealing - the Purpose of the Dealing - to include education, and parody or satire, in addition to research, private study, criticism and review.

In a press release on the Government of Canada's Balanced Copyright site, the Honourable [[James Moore (Canadian politician)|James Moore]], Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages, notes that the revamped bill "delivers a common-sense balance between the interests of consumers and the rights of the creative community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://balancedcopyright.gc.ca/eic/site/crp-prda.nsf/eng/h_rp01238.html |title=News release.

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Copyright law of New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]], fair dealing includes some copying for private study, research, criticism, review, and news reporting. Sections 42 and 43 of the [[Copyright Act 1994]] set out the types of copying that qualify. The criteria are perhaps most similar to those applying in the UK, although commercial research can still count as fair dealing in New Zealand. Incidental copying, while allowed, is not defined as "fair dealing" under the Act. As in Canada, fair dealing is not an infringement of copyright.

The factors determining whether copying for research or private study is judged to be fair dealing in New Zealand are its purpose, its effect on the potential market or value of the work copied, the nature of the work, the amount copied in relation to the whole work, and whether or not the work could have been obtained in a reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price.

===Singapore===
Under the provisions for "fair dealing" in the Copyright Act, Chapter 63 of [[Singapore]] [[Law of Singapore|Statutes]], a certain amount of copying for legitimate purposes, such as for the purpose of research or education, is permissible as long as it is a "fair dealing"{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}.

In deciding whether the use is a fair dealing, the following factors will be considered
* purpose and character of the dealing, including whether such dealing is of a commercial nature or is for non-profit educational purposes;
* nature of the work or adaptation;
* amount copied, relative to the whole work;
* effect of the dealing upon the potential market for the work, and effect upon its value;
* the possibility of obtaining the work or adaptation within a reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price.

In other cases, a fair dealing for the purpose of criticism or review; for the purpose reporting of news; for the purpose of judicial proceedings or professional advice would not constitute an infringement. In the case of criticism or review and the reporting of news, a sufficient acknowledgment of the work is required.

The reporting of the news could be by any means of communication to the public.

It is not an infringement if a person makes a copy from an original copy of a computer program which he or she owns for the purpose of using that duplicate copy as a back-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Fair_dealing_-_Fair_dealing_in_Singapore/id/5038873 |title=Fair dealing - Fair dealing in Singapore - Encyclopedia II &amp;#124; Global Oneness |publisher=Experiencefestival.com |date=2011-12-27 |accessdate=2012-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728110643/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Fair_dealing_-_Fair_dealing_in_Singapore/id/5038873 |archivedate=2013-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{See also|Copyright law of India}}
A fair dealing with any work (except computer programmes) is allowed in India for the purposes of -
# private or personal use, including research,&lt;ref&gt;Sec. 52(1)(a)(i) of the Copyright Act 1957&lt;/ref&gt; 
# criticism or review,&lt;ref&gt;Sec. 52(1)(a)(ii) of the Copyright Act 1957&lt;/ref&gt; 
# reporting of current events and current affairs, including the reporting of a lecture delivered in public.&lt;ref&gt;Sec. 52(1)(a)(iii) of the Copyright Act 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

The term fair dealing has not been defined anywhere in the Copyright Act 1957. However, the concept of 'fair dealing' has been discussed in different judgments, including the decision of the Supreme Court of India in ''Academy of General Education v. B. Malini Mallya'' (2009) and the decision of the [[High Court of Kerala]] in ''[[Civic Chandran v. Ammini Amma]]''.&lt;ref&gt;N.S. Gopalakrishnan and T.G. Agitha, Principles of Intellectual Property (Eastern Book Company 2014)369-393&lt;/ref&gt;

''Civic Chandran and Ors. v. C.Ammini Amma and Ors.'' is a 1996 Kerala High Court judgement that deals with the concept of fair dealing in India. In the case, a drama called "Ningal Enne Communistakki" was written by Thoppil Bhasi in Malayalam. It dealt with some of the burning social and political problems of those days, especially espoused by the then Communist Party of India to come to Power in Kerala during the assembly elections in 1957. The plaintiff brought a claim in this suit because the defendant, according to the plaintiff, had fabricated another drama called "Ningal Aare Communistakki", which was a counter drama to the drama written by Thoppil Bhasi and had been published in the 1995 annual issue of Ïndia Today". It was alleged that the defendant had copied substantial portions of the original drama in his work and such reproduction was done without true creative intention and to take advantage of the creative talent and labour of Thoppil Bhasi. The defendant on the other hand, claimed that the counter drama is a new literary innovation 'where a play is counter-posed by using the very same theme and characters. The counter drama was written for the purpose to provide critical analysis of the original drama and to show how the ultimate purpose intended by Thoppil Bhasi has failed. Hence, copying of certain portions can only be treated as 'fair dealing'. The lower court ruled in the favor of the plaintiff and said, "Copying down or extracting substantial portions of the drama, and using the same characters and dialogues of the drama with some comments here and there through two-three characters in the counter-drama cannot be treated as fair dealing for the purpose of criticism". Thus, he was not provided any protection under section 52 of the Copyright Act.

An appeal was filed against this judgement in the Kerala High Court, where the Court looked at the case while referring to sections 14,51 and 52 of Copyright Act. Herein, the defendant claimed that since there was high probability of the defence of fair dealing being applicable in the case, irreparable injury that could have been caused, especially, looking at the current political scenario in Kerala, which would also show a lack of balance of convenience. If the counter-drama is not staged, there essence would be lost. Plaintiffs’ argued that the lower court’s decision should not be reversed unless the same is found to be completely illegal or perverse.

The Indian Copyright Act does not provide for a definition for 'fair dealing' but section 52(1)(a) and (b) specifically refers to fair dealing of the work and not the reproduction of the work. Hence, the court needs to take into account the following 3 aspects:
a) The quantum and value of the matter taken in relation to the comments or criticism;
b) The purpose for which it was taken; and
c) The likelihood of competition between the two works.

Along with the aforementioned aspects, the balancing aspect given in the case ''American Cyanamid v. Ethicon''&lt;ref&gt;1975 R.P.C. 513&lt;/ref&gt; by Lord Diplock should be taken into account. As this suit was filed for granting interim injunction, the following also needs to be taken into account:
a) Establishment of a prima facie case;
b) The balance of convenience;
c) Irreparable injury likely to be caused in case the injunction is refused.

Subsequently, the Court relied on the decision given in ''Hubbard v Vosper'',&lt;ref&gt;1972 (2) W.L.R. 389&lt;/ref&gt; wherein Lord Denning had clarified that fair dealing is a question of degree. The number and extent of extracts and quotations and the use made of them need to be given due consideration. Also. there was also some reliance placed on ''R.G. Anand v. M/s Delux Films and Ors.'',&lt;ref&gt;AIR 1978 S.C. 1613&lt;/ref&gt; wherein it was stated that the safest and the surest test to determine copyright infringement is to see if the spectator, after having seen both the works, gets an unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the original. 
After analysing every scene of the counter drama and the drama, the Court reached the conclusion that the scenes and characters were not borrowed from the original drama for the purpose of reproduction in a substantial manner. The real objective of the counter-drama was to criticize the ideology depicted in the drama and to show how the drama had been unsuccessful in achieving the targets it had purported to have aimed for. It also said that there was enough material in the counter-drama to show that the Defendant had used labour and skill of his own and the differences between the original drama and the counter-drama could not be considered inconsequential. The portions of the original drama which were copied in the counter-drama were taken only to make the criticism more effective. Thus, no prima facie case could be established against the defendant. Also, there is no competition between the drama and the counter-drama. Moreover, if the injunction is granted, it would cause irreparable injury to the Defendants as they had made all arrangements to stage the counter drama and a huge amount of money was spent in that.

Hence, the decision of the Additional District Judge was reversed and it was held that even if the copying was of substantial portions, the same could be excused as it constituted fair dealing, as it was also in public interest.

===South Africa===
{{see also|South African copyright law}}
In South Africa, fair dealing is dealt with in the Copyright Act of 1978 (Act 98 of 1978, including subsequent amendments).  Fair dealing itself is described in section 12(1) of the Act, whereas sections 13 to 19 explains various exceptions to copyright.  Section 20 deals with the author's moral rights, which, if infringed, may also impact on a fair dealing ruling.

According to this Act,

Copyright shall not be infringed by any fair dealing with a literary or musical work
:(a) for the purposes of research or private study by, or the personal or private use of, the person using the work;
:(b) for the purposes of criticism or review of that work or of another work; or
:(c) for the purpose of reporting current events
::(i) in a newspaper, magazine or similar periodical; or
::(ii) by means of broadcasting or in a cinematograph film;
Provided that, in the case of paragraphs (b) and (c)(i), the source shall be mentioned, as well as the name of the author if it appears on the work.

Section 12 mentions both "fair dealing" and "fair practice", and it would seem that these two terms are equivalents. Musical works are compositions (i.e. manuscripts), not music recordings. The fair dealing exceptions do not apply to music recordings.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Fair dealing in United Kingdom law}}
Under the ''[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]'' (CDPA), fair dealing is limited to the following purposes: research and private study (both must be non-commercial), criticism / review / quotation, and news reporting (sections 29, 30, 178); as well as parody, caricature and pastiche (section 30A) and illustration for teaching. Although not actually defined as a fair dealing, incidental inclusion of a copyrighted work in an artistic work, sound recording, film, broadcast or cable programme doesn't infringe copyright. Since 2014 the UK has protected the fair dealing exceptions from override by contracts or contractual terms and conditions.

Contrary to the often stated view, the provisions of section 29 of the CDPA do ''not'' state the amount of an in-copyright work that may be copied for the purposes of non-commercial research or private study or to single copies of the work, where the copies are made by the researcher or student himself. Such restrictions only apply to copies made by or on behalf of a librarian (by virtue of s. 40), or by a person, other than the researcher or student himself, who knows or has reason to believe that "it will result in copies of substantially the same material being provided to more than one person at substantially the same time and for substantially the same purpose" (by virtue of parag. s. 29(3)b).

For copying beyond the boundaries of fair dealing, universities and schools in the UK obtain licences from a national [[copyright collective]], the UK [[The Copyright Licensing Agency|Copyright Licensing Agency]] (CLA).  Under these licences, multiple copies of portions of copyrighted works can be made for educational purposes.

The UK is the only Member State of the European Union that does not have a private copy exception, since the High Court has quashed the relevant regulations in ''British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (Basca) and Others v. Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills''. Consequently, now commonplace activities such as format shifting (saving one's music contained in their CDs on their MP3 players or on their smartphones) have become illegal.

===United States===
{{See also|Copyright law of the United States}}
The parallel concept in United States copyright law is [[fair use]]. The term "fair dealing" has a different meaning in the U.S. It is a duty of full disclosure imposed upon corporate officers, fiduciaries, and parties to contracts.  In the reported cases, it usually arises in the context of the "[[implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing]]," which underlies the tort cause of action for [[insurance bad faith]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Davis v. Blue Cross of Northern California'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/25C3d418.htm 25 Cal. 3d 418] (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

He further observed that the order was the result of fear that the text would be altered or abridged.

The book is divided into two parts. The first part deals with substantive law and the second part deals with procedure.

Historically, a major issue for the '''Bolivian nationality''' movement has been [[citizenship]] for [[indigenous people]]s.  Over time, the rights for the indigenous peoples in [[Bolivia]] have increased, including giving political voice and property rights.  Presently, the indigenous peoples are denied full citizenship.

==Indigenous movements==
An integral facet of the nationality movement in Bolivia concerns itself with the question of indigenous peoples. In part, the desire for independence from [[Spain]] stemmed from the growing mass of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] and other indigenous groups within Bolivia who were in the process of reacquiring an identity that was not linked to [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nicholson |first=Irene |title=The Liberators: A Study of Independence Movements in Spanish America |year=1969 |publisher=Faber and Faber Ltd. |location=London |pages=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While their subjugation and ostracization from the political arena is well catalogued, the fact remains that for a significant portion of Bolivia’s modern history natives were excluded from citizenship rights as well. The Spanish [[colony]] had shaped sociocultural diversity in its inception by establishing a [[republic|dual-republic]] model: that of the Spaniards, which was dominant, and that of the Indians, “which paid the first its tribute and its labor.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Van Cott |editor2=Donna Lee |title=Indigenous Peoples and Democracy in Latin America |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin’s Press |location=New York |pages=57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the establishment of “regimes of social order” created categories of belonging and “otherness” that continue into the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Postero |first=Nancy Grey |title=Now We Are Citizens: Indigenous Politics in Postmulticultural Bolivia |year=2007 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford |pages=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Deborah Yashar, author of "Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge", although indigenous peoples constitute a majority of the population in Bolivia, politicians are prone to use them as tools in the political process, essentially furthering their [[subjugation|subjugated]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, however, the inclusion of native imagery is often utilized to create a sense of [[national identity]], even though the indigenous peoples are excluded from participating in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Canessa, Andrew |title=Natives Making Nation: Gender, Indigeneity, and the State in the Andes |year=2005 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Tucson |pages=4, 132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Urban culture|urban]] elites tend to identify with indigenous imagery in order to distinguish themselves as Bolivian, although this serves as a contradiction, as they will vigorously attempt to draw distinctions between themselves and ‘real’ indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Canessa, Andrew |title=Natives Making Nation: Gender, Indigeneity, and the State in the Andes |year=2005 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Tucson |pages=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, it is “through the interplay of racial discrimination and gender hierarchy that the national ideal is constructed and … that racialized class inequality is reproduced and reinforced.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Canessa, Andrew |title=Natives Making Nation: Gender, Indigeneity, and the State in the Andes |year=2005 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Tucson |pages=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this course is shifting, as regional movements in both [[Andes|Andean]] and [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]ian Bolivia emerge to defend the local autonomy of separate native groups. An example of the need to protect the local autonomy is witnessed in the rise of state intervention in the Amazon, where previously this autonomy had fared well without state presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The end result of these movements was the forging and introduction of [[ethnicity|ethnic politics]] into the political debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While these did not reshape the entire political process, issues that began to dominate the national discourse included territorial autonomy, [[legal pluralism]], and [[land reform]], among other indigenous concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This in turn led to demanding equal positions in the nascent [[democracy]] created in the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there were three developments that impeded the rise of true indigenous autonomy in the political sphere. First of all, the success of “indigenous reforms” depended largely on the political will of the sitting [[Bolivian president]]. Second, political party competition was a significant obstacle, in that the various political parties already entrenched in the system would attempt to ensnare the indigenous movements, which had the effect of weakening the individual interest groups. By participating in electoral politics, the indigenous movement could be torn asunder, where factions and disagreements could be fomented over which party to support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=218–221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early identification among indigenous groups==

For most of the nineteenth century, when the question of citizenship began to rise to the fore, there existed in Bolivia two distinct entities, namely those with power and the indigenous groups. The desire of the native groups to be more than simply hard [[laborer]]s began to cause a rift in Bolivian society; as early as 1826, a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] vice-consular secretary noted that there were strong disintegrative forces at work within the republic, related to physical, cultural and regional diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were many reasons for the discontent among the native Bolivians, as well as for the fear among the ruling elite. One example is that the major urban centers were situated in the midst of the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Quechua people|Quechua]] communities, which were two of the more influential indigenous groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, of the more incendiary problems, the territorial issue was the more prominent, as it was an area of contention for many Bolivians. In the early nineteenth century, the indigenous population of Bolivia was divided between a servile [[Leasehold estate|tenantry]] who lived on landed estates and those communal members who inhabited independent communities, called ''[[ayllus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the first national census in 1846, over half the population lived on these communal landholdings; the significance in this is that [[peasant]] communities still held approximately half the land as well as half the population, whereas the servile tenantry was steadily declining. Seeing as how the indigenous population paid significant tributary [[tax]]es on all revenues, it became advantageous for the Bolivian republic to continue the system of official tributary and territorial identification as a basis of “Indianness,” rather than abolish the arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tributary system had been instituted as a result of economic collapse, Bolivia being an especially weakened and economically depressed country as the independence era drew to a close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, there existed a serious social stratification among indigenous communities, reinforced by the early republic: at the top were situated those living in ayllus, followed by the servile tenantry, with peasant freeholders situated on the bottom.

While all enjoyed a relatively institutionalized relationship with regards to the law and the governing [[bureaucracy]], the main separation lay in the fact that the first two social [[caste]]s held a vested interest in the tributary system, while the landless peasant did not. This led to a rapid decline in tributary populations, as these individuals would evade tax collectors and the official tax rolls. Therefore, to be perceived as Indian, or as truly indigenous, was not simply a legal and administrative tool, but rather a facet of everyday practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, indigenous tribes began to advocate for a “hybrid tributary-citizenship status,” which was firmly entrenched with land holdings; in other words, to hold land meant obtaining some variant of official citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempting land reform==

Eventually, however, this limited ideal for inclusive citizenship coupled with various failed attempts at land reform was insufficient to satisfy the native groups who wished to partake more fully in a growing economy. The government attempted at various moments during the 1860s to introduce Indian land reforms, which were met with stiff opposition. The 1863 decree by President [[Jose Maria de Acha]] dealt with revisiting idealized forms of Indian land tenure. Acha advocated the subdivision of communal plots leading to a participation in a [[free market economy]], where natives would buy and sell households at will, a practice that many believed would increase agricultural production and lead many Indians to becoming prosperous [[yeoman|yeomen]]. However, the government also stipulated that the Indian must “civilize,” by which it was understood that new households must conform to certain accepted norms, such that they be “comfortable, spacious and ventilated houses,” or the construction of state approved educational facilities would need to be undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government faced stiff opposition from indigenous groups and the venture was dropped until the land reforms were forced upon the population by subsequent governments in 1866 and 1868. In adopting these land reforms, the government demonstrated its ignorance of Indian culture within its own borders: by hoping that the indigenous peoples would adapt easily and sell off vast tracts of land to the highest bidder, thereby putting wastelands into production and easily increasing state revenues, they failed to consider traditional practices of land rotation. More important to the Indians claims to citizenship, however, was the land reformers’ plan to strengthen the image of the Indian as peasant, whereby any claims to citizenship would be dictated and controlled by the state: socializing them to perform [[manual labor]], to stay in the countryside, in all an attempt to civilize the Indians on the government’s terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=216, 244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not accepted quietly. The most active group in pursuing greater participation in acquiring citizenship rights was the Aymara, who would challenge the tributary system by day via official legal means, whereas at night they would embark upon [[guerrilla]] tactics to oppose the changes in land tenure being enforced by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1874 Ley de Ex-vinculacion==

This law saw the culmination of a decade of struggle between the various native groups and the government. It set the basic terms for Indian landholding that would continue up to the mid-twentieth century. While the law conceded the right of individual landownership to Indians, it also abolished the community as a [[juridical]] entity. Rather, this radical law dismantled the tributary system that had existed for decades, replaced instead by a universal [[property tax]]. Unfortunately, Indians lost the modicum of power that they had held as ethnic mediators; henceforth, they would be juridical subjects of civil law, “directly subject to the authority of white and mestizo agents and to the siege of the land market.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century==
As [[South America]]n states strengthened up to the mid-twentieth century, so too did the ideals attached to the notion of citizenship and belonging. Throughout, the hardness or flexibility of “ethnic hierarchies continued to be influenced through specific local power, socioeconomic, and demographic structures.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In regions where a dominant white had exercised excessive authority for many decades over a broad majority of subordinated ethnic groups, as in the case of Bolivia, ethnic hierarchies tended to remain more closed. However, the mid-twentieth century saw the emergence of indigenous [[intellectual]]s who desired to design, in the words of Jacobsen and de Losada, a “racial order for the nation capable of overcoming what they saw as the degenerate, corrupt, and chaotic Bolivian republic of the nineteenth century.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages= 164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change in attitudes and the desire to obtain an improved version of citizenship for indigenous groups began in the early stages of the twentieth century. At this point in time, Bolivian intellectuals began to distance themselves from racial theories that had long been imported from old Europe, and began to examine their own [[multicultural]] [[Kinship|heritage]]. One of the proposed methods to accomplish this was to propose new reforms that would genuinely benefit the Indian races within Bolivia, in the hopes that the entire state could benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One theory that emerged was the cultural nationalism of [[Franz Tamayo]]. Although taking a superior stance, he advocated the introduction of “educator-civilizers,” who would help uplift the indigenous peoples from their lack of citizenship rights; however, the Indian would have to earn his place within the nation-state through “productive labor, patriotic service, and civic virtues.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, Tamayo envisioned a social compact between the state and indigenous tribes, wherein citizenship was provided in exchange for the conversion of the Indian into something resembling the ruling classes.

However, although the clean-cut version of creating a common citizenship and nationality seemed easy to accomplish, the reality remained that nation building is a complex undertaking. This is especially true when the object of nationalization is located  the margins or even outside the boundaries of national belonging, owing to cultural practices and issues of race, class and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=247 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, it became obvious that the indigenous populations were not becoming consumed by the assimilationist attempt. The problem, as in the nineteenth century, was a question of Indian land ownership. Intensifying [[agrarianism|agrarian]] battles led to a growing amount of [[litigation]] and political campaigning by indigenous authorities, which had the effect of generating a type of official acknowledgement of their status and citizenship within Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a sense, the native groups used the weapons of the state to fashion a sense of belonging that rendered official their claims to citizenship rights. This led in turn to the growing movement of local and ethnic authorities mounting their own political discourses from below the mainstream political ideologies, from which they began to contest the political discourses and practices currently in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This emerging national network began to demand rights to land, to education, and to full citizenship. However, it would take several decades before any real headway could be made, but the groundwork had been laid.

===Political movements post-1950s===
For a brief moment, there seemed to be hope for the indigenous political movement. In 1953, a party known as the ''Movimiento Nacionalist Revolucionaria'' (MNR, [[Nationalist Revolutionary Movement]]) had led a national revolution coupled with an agrarian reform; this in turn was succeeded by over three decades of [[Military dictatorship|military rule]], where a Peasant-Military treaty was signed. The Aymara population collaborated closely with these regimes, in large part by stifling subversive attitudes. Their reward for their loyalty was [[universal suffrage]], as well as the ability to impose their own style of [[local government]] in extensive agricultural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Van Cott |editor2=Donna Lee |title=Indigenous Peoples and Democracy in Latin America |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin’s Press |location=New York |pages=58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, indigenous tribes still emerged in the 1980s with the desire to eradicate the exploitation and oppression of the Aymara and other indigenous peoples that had not been addressed by any government since the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Van Cott |editor2=Donna Lee |title=Indigenous Peoples and Democracy in Latin America |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin’s Press |location=New York |pages=55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By and large, the Aymara were elected by popular acclaim to lead indigenous groups to larger citizenship; the Aymara, for their part, renewed their support for the MNR. By the 1990s, the MNR saw resurgence in popularity, their candidate winning the presidential election in 1993. Upon his victory, he stated that “marginalization, inequality, and discrimination will be diminished in Bolivia, so as to yield to the building of a multicultural, multiethnic and plurinational country.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Van Cott |editor2=Donna Lee |title=Indigenous Peoples and Democracy in Latin America |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin’s Press |location=New York |pages=56, 58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The future for indigenous peoples seemed bright indeed. Unfortunately, although the native movement was allied with the winning party, their inherent political weakness prevented them from enjoying full advantage of its access to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Van Cott |editor2=Donna Lee |title=Indigenous Peoples and Democracy in Latin America |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin’s Press |location=New York |pages=74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
With enthusiasm and expectations concerning their acceptance into full citizenship running so high, there was bound to be disappointment. With the first consecutive elected governments for decades, the first governments in Bolivia were more occupied with facing the challenge of mounting [[debt]]s and weak [[Economy of Bolivia|economies]] than rectify the citizenship status of indigenous peoples, even if these same peoples had lent the party enough clout to ascend to governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morales |first=Waltraud Q. |title=A Brief History of Bolivia |year=2003 |publisher=Facts on File Inc. |location=New York |pages=197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, for most of the nineties, each successive government faced a different national crisis that required full attention. For the most part, although the future is brighter than it was in the nineteenth century, as indigenous peoples now have political voice as well as [[property rights]], native peoples in Bolivia continue to be frustrated and exempt from full citizenship status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morales |first=Waltraud Q. |title=A Brief History of Bolivia |year=2003 |publisher=Facts on File Inc. |location=New York |pages=225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of election irregularities, INEC spokesman Philip Umeadi said on April 19 that "We are not sitting on any crisis in Nigeria."&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first= Lydia|last=Polgreen|authorlink=Lydia Polgreen |title= Nigeria Frets Over How to Give Voters a Real Say|newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|page= A3|date= 2007-04-20|accessdate= 2007-04-20|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/20/world/africa/20nigeria.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
The mission of INEC is to serve as an independent and effective EMB committed to the conduct of free, fair and credible elections for sustainable democracy in Nigeria. The vision of INEC is to be one of the best Election Management Bodies (EMB) in the world that meets the aspirations of the Nigerian people.

==History==

The origin of the INEC goes back to the period before Independence when the Electoral Commission of Nigeria was established to conduct 1959 elections. The Federal Electoral Commission (FEDECO), established in 1960 conducted the immediate post-independence federal and regional elections of 1964 and 1965. The electoral body was dissolved after the military coup of 1966. In 1978, the Federal Electoral Commission was constituted by the regime of General [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], organizing the elections of 1979 which ushered in the [[Nigerian Second Republic]] under the leadership of Alhaji [[Shehu Shagari]]. It also conducted the general elections of 1983.&lt;ref name=self&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=Independent National Electoral Commission
 |accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1995, the military government of General [[Sani Abacha]] established the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria which  conducted another set of elections. These elected institutions were not inaugurated before the sudden death of General Abacha on June 1998 aborted the process. In 1998 General [[Abdulsalam Abubakar]]'s Administration dissolved NECON and established the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). INEC organized the transitional elections that ushered in the [[Nigerian Fourth Republic]] on May 29, 1999.&lt;ref name=self/&gt;

In January 2015, the "[[Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping|#BringBackOurGirls]] group has raised the alarm over plans by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to exclude [[Chibok]] and some communities currently under the control of the [[Boko Haram]] from getting the permanent voter cards (PVCs) for the [[Nigerian general election, 2015|February elections]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Leadership==

The chairmen of the first Nigerian Federal Electoral Commission was Chief [[Eyo Esua]] (1964–1966) in the [[Nigerian First Republic|First Republic]]. When General [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] prepared for a return to civilian power in the [[Nigerian Second Republic|Second Republic]], he established a new Federal Electoral Commission headed by Chief [[Michael Ani]] to supervise the 1979 elections. Ani was succeeded by Justice [[Victor Ovie Whisky]].
During the [[Ibrahim Babangida]] and [[Sani Abacha]] regimes, which attempted returns to democracy, the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria was headed by Professor [[Eme Awa]] (1987–1989), Professor [[Humphrey Nwosu]] (1989–1993), Professor [[Okon Uya]] and Chief [[Sumner Dagogo-Jack]] (1994–1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

General [[Abdulsalami Abubakar]] established the current INEC, with Justice [[Ephraim Akpata]] as chairman.
Akpata had to deal with 26 political associations, giving only nine provisional registration as political parties for the 1998/1999 elections, eventually whittled down to three parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Despite efforts to ensure free and fair elections, the process drew serious criticism from international observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After Akpata died in January 2000, the government of President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] appointed [[Abel Guobadia]] Nigeria's Chief Electoral Officer, a position that was confirmed by the Nigerian Senate in May 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Guobadia was responsible for the 2003 elections, which were marred by widespread violence and other irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In June 2005, Guobadia retired and was succeeded by Professor [[Maurice Iwu]]. Soon after being appointed, Iwu announced that foreign monitors would not be allowed during elections, but only foreign election observers. This decision was condemned by politicians and civil society groups who called for his immediate removal from office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 8 June, 2010, Professor [[Attahiru Muhammadu Jega]] was nominated by President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] as the new INEC Chairman, subject to Senate confirmation, as a replacement for Iwu, who had vacated the post on 28 April 2010.&lt;ref name=dtrust599&gt;{{cite web

The Senate President [[David Mark]], Speaker of the House of Representatives [[Oladimeji Bankole]], and most of the state Governors also attended the meeting.
Unanimous approval by the council of the nominee for this critical appointment avoided controversy about whether or not the President should appoint the chairman of the INEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Reactions to the announcement from a broad spectrum of political leaders and organisations were positive, although some voiced concern that it could be too late to implement real reforms before the 2011 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaigning for the [[Nigerian general election, 2015|2015 Nigerian general election]], Attahiru Jega "faced fierce criticism from both the opposition and the ruling party."&lt;ref name = "vanguard20150323"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Nigeria: Five Key Figures to Watch in Nigeria Election| work = allAfrica.com: Vanguard| accessdate = 2015-03-27| date = 2015-03-23| url = http://allafrica.com/stories/201503240735.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Attahiru Jega's five-year term came to an end on June 30, 2015, and though he was qualified for re-appointment, the chances of such became remote given the allegations of bias against him by campaign officials of President Goodluck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea''' ('''ITLOS''') is an [[intergovernmental organization]] created by the mandate of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea#UNCLOS III|Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea]]. It was established by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], signed at [[Montego Bay, Jamaica]], on December 10, 1982. The Convention entered into force on November 16, 1994, and established an international framework for law over "all ocean space, its uses and resources". The tribunal is based in Hamburg, Germany. The Convention also established the [[International Seabed Authority]], with responsibility for the regulation of seabed mining beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, that is beyond the limits of the territorial sea, the contiguous zone and the continental shelf.  There are currently 167 signatories, 166 states plus the [[European Union]].

== Composition ==

According to its founding statute, the Tribunal has a set of 21 serving judges from a variety of states parties. 

At the request of [[Chile]] and the European Union, the Tribunal set up a special chamber composed of 5 judges to deal with the ''Case concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Exploitation of Swordfish Stocks in the South-Eastern Pacific Ocean (Chile/European Community)''.

By agreement of the parties [[Ghana]] and [[Ivory Coast]], the Tribunal formed a special chamber composed of 5 judges to deal with the ''Dispute Concerning Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary between Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire in the Atlantic Ocean (Ghana/Côte d'Ivoire)''.

A '''Letter of Undertaking''' or LOU is a formal text that sums up the terms and undertaking of a [[contract]] which mostly has been negotiated up to this point only in spoken form. It reviews the terms of an agreement for a [[Service (economics)|service]], a [[project]] or a deal and is often written as a step before a more detailed contract is issued.

The LOU may provide for example:
* detailed summary of the work to be performed
* tasks of the [[service provider]] and the receiver
* [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] for the work to be done
* work steps that have been accomplished already

In international banking system, Letter of Undertaking (LOU) is a provision of bank guarantee, under which a bank allows its customer to raise money from another Indian bank's foreign branch in the form of a short term credit. The LOU serves the purpose of a bank guarantee. However, to be able to raise the LOU, the customer is supposed to pay margin money to the bank issuing the LOU and accordingly, he is granted a credit limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/business/pnb-rs-11-300-crore-nirav-modi-fraud-explained-in-10-points-1813475|title=What Is LoU?

The Letter of Undertaking may also introduce key contractual elements, like [[payment]] terms.

{{Rape}}

== Background ==
Proponents of rape-marriage laws argue that they shield the survivor and her family from the shame of rape.&lt;ref name="newsdeeply.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dehnert|first1=Elspeth|title=As Lebanon, Jordan, Tunisia End ‘Marry-Your-Rapist’ Laws, Where Next?|url=https://www.newsdeeply.com/womenandgirls/articles/2017/08/22/as-lebanon-jordan-tunisia-end-marry-your-rapist-laws-where-next|accessdate=16 November 2017|agency=News Deeply|date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many women do not report their sexual assault because they fear this shame, and the possibility of being murdered by a fellow family member.&lt;ref name="newsdeeply.com"/&gt; If a woman simply marries her rapist, she preserves her family name and avoids a life of sexual shame. In a study conducted in Taiwan in August 2000, 35 rape survivors were interviewed to analyze the trauma that was undergone by these women, as well as any sexual shame or anxiety they may have felt as a result of their assault.&lt;ref name="Marrying My Rapist?!’"&gt;{{cite article|last1=Luo|first1=Tsun-Yin|title=“‘Marrying My Rapist?!’”|doi=10.1177/089124300014004006|journal=Gender &amp; Society|page=581-597|volume=14|date=1 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this study show that these women feared being vocal about their assault, felt guilty for shaming their families, experienced sexual shame and self blame, and developed negative views of themselves as women.&lt;ref name="Marrying My Rapist?!’"/&gt; Those who are against rape-marriage laws do not think victims should be left feeling this way after they have suffered an attack, or feel the need to cover up the assault by marrying the perpetrator. Opponents claim the laws promote impunity for rape, and further victimize rape survivors.&lt;ref name="JordanNYT"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/world/middleeast/jordan-rape-law.html |title=Jordan Moves to Repeal Marry-Your-Rapist Law |author=Somini Sengupta |work=The New York Times |date=1 August 2017 |accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sims"/&gt; Thus, the ''social'' value of women, as proponents assign to family honour, female chastity and marital status, clashes with opponents' claim of women's right to ''individual'' happiness, freedom and sexual autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Shrage |first1=Laurie J. |last2=Stewart |first2= Robert Scott |date=2015 |title=Philosophizing About Sex |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RysEBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59 |location=Toronto |publisher=Broadview Press |page=59 |isbn=9781770485365 |accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Purna Sen, the policy director for UN Women, these laws were passed to normalise the unlawful sexual activities. They make the sexual relations more respectable in the society because it is considered problematic in a few cultures. Countries who have these laws fall under the category of undeveloped countries and conservative countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/09/542468265/countries-around-the-world-move-to-repeal-marry-your-rapist-laws|title=Countries Around The World Move To Repeal 'Marry Your Rapist' Laws|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Antiquity until 1900 ===
{{See also|Rape in the Hebrew Bible}}
Traditionally, the marriage of the perpetrator and the victim after the rape was often seen as an appropriate 'resolution' of the situation. Among ancient cultures virginity was highly prized, and a woman who had been raped had little chance of marrying. These laws forced the rapist to provide for their victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co. | isbn = 978-0-8028-4803-1 | last = Witte | first = John | author2 = Robert M. Kingdon | title = Sex, marriage, and family life in John Calvin's Geneva | location = Grand Rapids, Mich. | year = 2005 | pages = 120–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such provision can be found in the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Book of Deuteronomy]] 22:28-29 (written around the 7th century BCE), wherein sexual intercourse between a man and an unbetrothed virgin woman outside the city is considered wrongful. Irrespective of whether or not the woman had given consent to the sexual act, or will give consent to marriage, the man is given the option of marrying her by paying her parents a [[dowry]] to settle the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Newsom |first1=Carol Ann |last2=Ringe |first2=Sharon H. |date=1998 |title=Women's Bible Commentary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ymp4S2qZJ4cC&amp;pg=PA6 |location= |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |pages=62–63 |isbn=9780664257811 |accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medieval Europe]], for example, a man could 'rape' a woman, after which she could choose or be pressured to marry her attacker, because she was considered to be a damaged commodity, diminishing her marital prospects. In this specific context, however, the term 'rape' could also refer to [[elopement]]: a woman would give her consent to being abducted by the man she loved, and thus avoid asking permission from her parents to marry him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bardsley |first=Sandy |date=2007 |title=Women's Roles in the Middle Ages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4SL2X3uHEAC&amp;pg=PA138 |location=London |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |page=138 |isbn=9780313336355 |accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing [[Bible|Biblical]] injunctions (particularly [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:16–17 and [[Deuteronomy]] 22:25–30), [[Calvinist Geneva]] (1536–1564) permitted a single woman's father to consent to her marriage to her rapist, after which the husband would have no right to divorce; the woman had no explicitly stated separate right to refuse. The only consequence that the rapist faced was to pay a fine to the father of the woman that he raped. According to the Johannah Stiebert, women that were not engaged were not able to consent, so rape became a matter of male superiority.&lt;ref&gt;Stiebert, Johannah. “Sex, Rape and Social History – The Case of the Bible.” Shiloh Project, 27 June 2017, shiloh-project.group.shef.ac.uk/?p=1530.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th and 21st century ===
In several [[MENA|Middle Eastern and North African countries]], marry-the-rapist laws that were adopted upon achieving independence in the mid-20th century, were carried over from various earlier periods. The origins of these laws are to be traced to a mixture of pre-existing local Arab traditions, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman imperial]] laws and European ([[French colonial empire|French]] and [[British Empire|British]]) colonial laws.&lt;ref name="selfscholar"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://selfscholar.wordpress.com/2012/07/18/the-middle-easts-rape-marriage-laws/ |title=The Middle East’s "Rape-Marriage" Laws |work=Selfscholar |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These practices were also seen in Asian countries, such as [[India]]. Traditionally, a woman was considered to be the property of her father. If she was raped, she was considered damaged property “so the rapist must either pay ‘compensation’ or accept the damaged goods” and marry the victim.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite article|last1=Jolly|first1=Stellina|last2=Raste|first2=M.S.|title=“Rape and Marriage: Reflections on the Past, Present, and Future"|journal=Journal of the Indian Law Institute|volume=48|page=277-284|jstor=43952037|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid paying the family, the perpetrator often chose to marry the victim, who “had absolutely no choice but to marry the rapist and spend the rest of the life” with them.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; In this way, some might argue that the victim of the assault had a harsher punishment than their attacker. Now, looking at India’s Penal Code, the legislation “makes it amply clear that marriage does not act as an absolving factor in case of rape”.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Marry-your-rapist laws were common around the world until the 1970s. Since the late 20th century, the remaining laws of this type have been increasingly challenged and repealed in a number of countries.&lt;ref name="Sengupta"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hrw-leb/&gt;

By 1997, 15 Latin American countries had laws that exonerated a rapist if he offered to marry the victim and she accepted. These countries were Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru (since 1924), Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, Uruguay and Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Sims"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Warrick66/&gt; Costa Rica exonerated a rapist if he expresses an intention to marry the victim, even if she did not accept.&lt;ref name=Warrick66/&gt; The law in Peru was modified in 1991 to absolve all co-defendants in a [[gang rape]] case if any one of them married the victim. By 2017, all but four of these countries have definitively repealed these laws. Colombia repealed the law in 1997, Peru and Chile in 1999, Brazil and Uruguay in 2005, Nicaragua and Guatemala in 2006, Costa Rica in 2007, Panama in 2008, Argentina in 2012, Ecuador in 2014. Italy had similar laws until 1981.

In 2017, a [[World Bank Group]] report claimed there were 12 countries left with marry-your-rapist laws: Angola, Bahrain, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Palestine, the Philippines, Syria, and Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wbl.worldbank.org/en/data/exploretopics/protecting-women-from-violence#a |title=Protecting women from violence |work=Women, Business and the law Indicator Data |publisher=World Bank Group |date=2017 |accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2017, marry-your-rapist laws still existed – but were being challenged – in Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, the Philippines, Syria and Tajikistan, amongst others, according to various media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-rape-law-idUSKCN1AW27X |title=Lebanon scraps law absolving rapists who marry victims |work=Reuters |publisher= |date=16 August 2017 |accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC16Aug17"/&gt;

=== Illegal continued existence ===
The practice of forcing victims of rape to marry their rapists continues even in many countries where the laws allowing this have been abolished, or never explicitly existed to begin with.&lt;ref name="newsdeeply.com"/&gt; This is the case, for example, in Ethiopia, where [[marriage by abduction]] remains common, despite it being illegal under the new 2004 Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/69993/ethiopia-surviving-forced-marriage|title=IRIN Africa - ETHIOPIA: Surviving forced marriage - Ethiopia - Children - Gender Issues|work=IRINnews|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Afghanistan]], while formally there is no law, "in practice it is not uncommon for a prosecution to be dropped if marriage is offered by the perpetrator or his family."&lt;ref name="EqualityNow"/&gt; Similar to Afghanistan, Somaliland also did not previously have any laws; however, it still wasn’t uncommon for a rape victim’s family to pressure them into marrying the perpetrator.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Butcher|first1=Ryan|title="Rapists in Somaliland Will No Longer Be Allowed to Marry Victims under New Law"|agency=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/somaliland-rape-legal-outlaw-violent-sexual-crime-hiv-president-musa-bihi-adbi-a8160691.html.|date=15 January 2018 |accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These organisations have been working towards abolishing this kind of laws, and in several cases they have been successful.  However, the opposition to the “marry-your-rapist” laws has been less significant than the other demands made by women’s groups to criminalize [[marital rape]] altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sengupta|first1=Somini|title=One by One, Marry-Your-Rapist Laws Are Falling in the Middle East|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/22/world/middleeast/marry-your-rapist-laws-middle-east.html|accessdate=17 November 2017|agency=The New York Times|date=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== El Salvador  ===
“In 1996 the Assembly of [[El Salvador]] repealed an old law that exonerated a rapist if he offered to marry the victim and she accepted.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220055055/http://www.state.gov/1997-2001-NOPDFS/global/human_rights/1998_hrp_report/elsalvad.html|title=1998 Human Rights Report - El Salvador|date=2014-12-20|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many rapists still had the ability to get away with rape by marrying the victim according to a law made in 1994 known as Article 14, which stated that as a general rule, persons under eighteen years of age can not marry, but established in the second paragraph, that exceptionally they can contract marriage if they are pubescent, they already have a child in common, or if the woman is pregnant.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asamblea.gob.sv/decretos/details/3117|title=REFÓRMASE EL CÓDIGO DE FAMILIA. {{!}} Asamblea Legislativa de El Salvador|website=www.asamblea.gob.sv|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law was abolished in 2017.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-marriage/el-salvador-scraps-controversial-law-allowing-pregnant-minors-to-wed-idUSKCN1AY01I&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
{{Further|Franca Viola}}
Article 544 of the Italian Criminal Code considered rape an offence against 'public morality', not against an individual person. If the perpetrator married his victim, even if she was a minor, any sexual offence would lapse. Neither the law nor society made a distinction between such premarital rape on the one hand, and consensual [[elopement]] (in Sicily commonly called ''fuitina'') on the other. Socially, the victim was put under heavy pressure to agree to marrying her rapist; the alternative was being shunned for the rest of her life as ''una donna svergognata'': a "woman without honour" (literally: a shameless woman). The victim was held responsible for the humilation of losing her virginity out of wedlock, bringing shame upon herself and her family. If she agreed to marry her attacker, it was thus considered a "reparational marriage" (''matrimonio riparatore''), that restored her family's honour.&lt;ref name="Pirro"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pirro |first=Deirdre |date=2009 |title=Italian Sketches: The Faces of Modern Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kK7y_GFLujkC&amp;pg=PA94 |location=Prato |publisher=The Florentine Press |page=94 |isbn=9788890243448 |accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, [[Franca Viola]] was one of the first women to refuse a "reparational marriage" publicly. Franca Viola was only 17 years old when she was raped with the intention of marriage in 1965. The aftermath of her trial ruled that rapists were no longer able to avoid punishment through the marriage of their victims.&lt;ref name="Pirro"/&gt; In 1981, Italy eventually repealed Article 544.&lt;ref name="Cleave"/&gt;

=== Jordan === 
Article 308 in the [[Jordan]]ian Penal Code was voted to be abolished by Parliament on 1 August 2017. The article allowed for an aggressor of sexual assault to avoid persecution and punishment if he married the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2016/1/10/jordan-might-end-law-allowing-rapists-to-marry-victims|title=Jordan might end law allowing rapists to marry victims|last=Arab|first=The New|work=alaraby|access-date=2017-03-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was amended in 2016, barring full pardon in cases of rape but keeping a loophole clause that pardoned perpetrators if they married the victim if she is aged between 15 and 18 and if the assault was regarded as “consensual.” Early in 2017, the 10-person Royal Committee for Developing the Judiciary and Enhancing the Rule of Law presented [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah]] a report recommending the closing of the loophole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/activists-applaud-royal-committee%E2%80%99s-recommendations-women-rights|title=Activists applaud Royal committee’s recommendations on women rights|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was abolished in a "historic vote" by the [[House of Representatives of Jordan|House of Representatives]] of the [[Parliament of Jordan|Parliament]] on 1 August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jordantimes.com/news/local/historic-vote-house-abolishes-controversial-article-308|title=In historic vote, House abolishes controversial Article 308|work=The Jordan Times|date=1 August 2017|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 308 of the Jordanian reformatory code implies that a rapist can escape punishment on the off chance that he consents to wed his victim. Only if the marriage lasts under three years does he need to serve his time.  Through 2010 and 2013, a sum of 159 attackers strolled free along the lines of their punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rape-conviction-laws-marry-rapist-jordan-egypt-morocco-tunisia-came-from-french-colonial-times-a7872556.html|title=Laws that allow rapists to marry their victims come from colonialism, not Islam|date=2017-08-02|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to family and social pressures the rape victim chooses to settle the matter by marrying the rapist. “The law has permitted such a resolution out of recognition of the cultural value placed upon female virginity at marriage; despoiled girls and women are a source of shame for their families, innocent of wrongdoing though they may be.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even though settling the case by marrying the rapist is viewed as a practical solution, the attackers frequently separate from their spouses/casualties not long after in the wake of wedding to stay away from criminal accusations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;“The marriage loophole was created and used for the purpose of providing social problem solving rather than criminal justice, and it addressed the social practices surrounding raped women and family honour, rather than the crimes against individual women. The problem of the social existence of a raped woman is settled by having the rape victim disappear, to be replaced by a wife.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Marital rape that takes place behind closed doors remains legal in Jordan.

To resolve these issues there is an Islamic charity called “the Chastity Society” (Al-‘Af¯af). The director of the society, Dr. Mufid Sarhan explained that “falling marriage rates were socially disruptive and threatened to draw youths into illegitimate sexual relations, and he blamed the situation on a combination of government mismanagement and backward societal expectations that put marriage out of reach for many. To mitigate the disruptive potential of the crisis, the Chastity Society organized an annual mass wedding as a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional weddings and worked with the Jordan Islamic Bank to dispense millions of dinar in interest-free loans to young couples. Led by President Abdul-Latif Arabiyyat (former head of the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood’s political wing, the Islamic Action Front), the society presented itself as an alternative to the family and the state, which were rendered deficient in its view because of their inability to properly channel the sexual relationships of Jordanian youth. Through its knowledge production and broader activism, the Chastity Society used the state’s Sharia Court data as evidence of the state’s failure to legitimate the marriages of its citizens—and, hence, as evidence of the moral inadequacy of the state itself.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HUGHES|first=GEOFFREY|date=2015-05-01|title=Infrastructures of legitimacy: The political lives of marriage contracts in Jordan|url=https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/amet.12130|journal=American Ethnologist|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=279–294|doi=10.1111/amet.12130|issn=1548-1425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malaysia]] does not have a rape-marriage law, but nearly did by judicial ruling in 2015–16.

In 2012, [[Morocco]] amended Article 475, which provided between one- to five-year prison sentence for a perpetrator that abducted or deceived a minor with no resort to violence or threat, or attempted to do so.

=== Palestine ===

Ikhlas Sufan, director of a [[Nablus]] victims of violence shelter, told Human Rights Watch that "between 2011 and 2017 prosecution for rape has been halted in 60 cases – in which the shelter was helping the women – after the alleged rapist agreed to marry the victim.

=== Peru === 
After gaining independence in 1821, the first draft of the Peruvian penal code included a section specifically focused on the violence against women. This section encompassed a certain legal code that was meant to protect the “virginity” of women. It was not until 1924 when legislation was passed which stated that rapists were legally able to be exempt from sexual assault charges through a loophole. In cases of rape and to serve as a punishment for the perpetrator, the victim was required to enter into a marriage with their rapist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mujica|first=Jaris|date=November 2011|title=Violaciones sexuales en el Perú 2000-2009: un informe sobre el estado de la situación|url=|journal=UNFPA|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion that marriage could possibly restore a raped woman’s honor has been linked to the countries historical, patriarchal, and gender norms. In 1991, this law was modified to absolve co-conspirators in a gang rape case if one of them marries the victim. These laws were enacted upon the belief that it would protect the honor of both the victim and their family.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marrying Your Rapist: Domesticating War Crimes in Ayacucho, Peru|last=Boesten|first=Jelke|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to cultural beliefs, instead of losing her virginity because of immoral behavior, a woman -or her father- retains the ability to claim that the act had taken place due to coercion, thereby saving the victims personal virtue. Marriage, in turn, would solve the problem of a lost virginity and possible illegitimate child, thus returning honor to the family.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Peruvian government started to design and implement policies against domestic violence in 1988 after research showed them to have one of the highest rates of domestic violence against women ranking them 16th in the world. Per research, statistics from several Peruvian institutions, including emergency centers, police reports, and the Ministry for Women and Social Development, approximately 68,818 reports of sexual assaults were received during a ten-year span, which averages to an estimate of 18.8 cases that are reported per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boesten|first=Jelke|date=August 2012|title=The State and Violence Against Women in Peru: Intersecting Inequalities and Patriarchal Rule|url=|journal=Oxford University Press|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 1997, The Peruvian Congress voted to repeal the 1924 law that allowed rapists to be exonerated from sexual assault charges if they married their victims. The bill was passed by a vote of 86 to 1. According to congresswoman Beatriz Merino, who sponsored the bill, “This is a great victory for Peruvian women, and also for Peruvian men, since all of us together can celebrate the end of this embarrassment”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/05/world/peru-s-congress-repeals-law-protecting-rapists.html|title=Peru's Congress Repeals Law Protecting Rapists|last=Reuters|first=Alan|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=April 5, 1997|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Somalia ===
[[Somalia|Somali]] law draws its inspiration from [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and [[xeer]]. As of 2018, most cases of rape and sexual assault in Somalia are still settled through xeer, which is the country's native traditional "cast-based dispute resolution system in which traditional male elders dispense justice according to customary laws." Following the customs of xeer, it is common for a 'diya' (a fine of money, camels or goats) to be paid by the rapist's family to the rape survivor's family, but in extreme scenarios, the victim is forced to marry her rapist.&lt;ref name="Wadekar"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/a20060854/welcome-to-puntland-where-men-dont-consider-rape-a-crime/ |title=Welcome to Puntland: where many men don't consider rape a crime |author=Neha Wadekar |work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]] |date=26 April 2018 |accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 1991, Somalia has been in a [[Somali Civil War|state of civil war]], without a functioning central government that controls the entire country. The northwestern region of Somaliland unilaterally declared independence in May 1991, while the northeastern region of Puntland unilaterally declared its regional autonomy within Somalia in 1998; both gradually evolved their own legal systems, and made efforts to outlaw the practice of forcing a rape victim to marry her attacker in the late 2010s.

==== Puntland ====
The self-declared autonomous region of [[Puntland]] adopted a Sexual Offences Act in 2017, that criminalised all forms of sexual violence against women.&lt;ref name="Wadekar"/&gt;

==== Somaliland ====
The unrecognised state of [[Somaliland]], which declared its independence in 1991 but is internationally still considered part of [[Somalia]], did not have any law explicitly allowing rapists to marry their victims in order to go free. However, since the practice is in fact occurring, which a number of politicians have found undesirable, efforts have been undertaken to formally ban it. In January 2018, the government “introduced a bill to outlaw rape and other violent sexual crimes for the first time in its history, which would see rapists imprisoned for up to 30 years”. The bill was approved by the lower house of Parliament.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; The president of Somaliland, Musa Bihi Adbi, hoped that this law will help to eliminate violence against women throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shaban|first1=Abdur Rahman Alfa|title="Rapists in Somaliland Can No Longer Marry Victims, Could Face 30 Years in Jail"|agency=Africa News|url=http://www.africanews.com/2018/01/11/rapists-in-somaliland-can-no-longer-marry-victims-could-face-30-years-in-jail//.|date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Syria ===
[[Syria]]’s family and criminal law are based on [[Sharia]] and as a result women and men are treated unequally under many of the current laws in place. This can be seen in the laws concerning rape as rapists can escape punishment if the victim agrees to marriage as stated in Article 508 of the penal code, "If there is a contracted marriage between the man who commits rape, sexual abuse, kidnapping, sexual harassment and the victim, then there is no charge or the punishment is stopped”.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154473.htm|title=Syria|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law is particularly harmful because many victims are pressured into marrying their rapist due to societal pressures. Unlike some other countries, rapists cannot marry victims that are too young to get married, even in cases of pregnancy and, in fact, receive an extended prison sentence.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Tunisia ===
In July 2017, [[Tunisia]] repealed Article 227 of its Criminal Code which provided a rapist the exemption to avoid all investigations or legal consequences if he married his victim.&lt;ref name="Al-monitor"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCormick-Cavanagh|first1=Conor|title=New Tunisian Law Takes Long Stride Toward Gender Equality|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/en/originals/2017/07/tunisia-new-law-women-protection-violence-rape-2018.html|website=Al-monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; This repeal of the “marry-your-rapist” law was part of a much larger law in Tunisia to outlaw all violence against women. In a 2010 study by the National Office of Family and Population, 47% of Tunisian women reported being victims of violence.&lt;ref name="al-monitor.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCormick-Cavanagh|first1=Conor|title=New Tunisian law takes long stride toward gender equality|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/en/originals/2017/07/tunisia-new-law-women-protection-violence-rape-2018.html|accessdate=16 November 2017|agency=Al-Monitor|date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an event that occurred in 2016, a young man raped his 13-year-old step-sister and married her after she became pregnant. An alleged rapist was able to end his prosecution if he married his victim. The court ruled that this was allowed under Article 277, which has since been removed. The backlash that was received after this ruling contributed to the repeal of the Article in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Agerholm, Harriet. “13-Year-Old Girl Forced to Marry Her 'Rapist' Step-Brother.” The Independent, Independent Digital News and Media, 19 Dec. 2016, www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/rape-tunisia-13-year-old-girl-pregnant-article-227-child-marriage-womens-right-consent-a7483941.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The new law encompasses all forms of violence or discrimination against women, such as psychological abuse or economic discrimination, and is thus a breakthroughs for women’s rights in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blaise|first1=Lilia|title=Tunisia Takes a Big Step to Protect Women From Abuse|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/world/africa/tunisia-women-domestic-violence.html|accessdate=16 November 2017|agency=The New York Times|date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same law criminalizes [[marital rape]], classifying it as a crime in its own right, and has been commended for its preventative measures to the issue of violence.&lt;ref name="al-monitor.com"/&gt;

'''Background'''

Under the [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali regime]], women's rights were not given much importance. Women made up only 20% of Tunisia’s work force, and they were constrained to low-paying, insecure jobs. Rural Tunisian women also faced deprivation and hardship.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Labidi|first1=Mehrezia|title=Tunisia's women are at the heart of its revolution|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/23/tunisia-women-revolution|accessdate=16 November 2017|agency=The Guardian|date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freedoms of expression and association were limited. Heavy restrictions on registration to work for women’s organizations and political parties were in place.&lt;ref name="genderindex.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tunisia|url=https://www.genderindex.org/country/tunisia/|website=Social Institutions and Gender Index|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming participation of women during the [[Tunisian Revolution|Tunisian revolution in 2011]] made way for transformative changes in Tunisian politics in regards to gender. Tunisia has since been a symbol of advancement of women’s rights in the [[Arab world]], being one of the first countries to establish women’s voting rights, right to abortion, right to divorce and outlawing polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kilkenny|first1=Katie|title=A Look at the Women Behind Tunisia's Democratic Revolution|url=https://psmag.com/news/a-look-at-the-women-behind-tunisias-democratic-revolution|accessdate=16 November 2017|agency=Pacific Standard|date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outset of the revolution, women were as active as men in demanding equal access to jobs, education and basic rights and freedoms.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; Women were heavily involved in the drafting of the [[Tunisian Constitution of 2014|new constitution]] after the revolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charrad|first1=Mounira|last2=Zarrugh|first2=Amina|title=The Arab Spring and Women’s Rights in Tunisia|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2013/09/04/the-arab-spring-and-womens-rights-in-tunisia/|website=E-International Relations|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which guarantees equality based on gender in at least one area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does the constitution take at least one approach to gender equality?|url=https://www.worldpolicycenter.org/policies/does-the-constitution-take-at-least-one-approach-to-gender-equality|website=World Policy Centre|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 21 of the constitution states that "All male and female citizens have the same rights and duties.

=== Uruguay === 
Article 116 of the Penal Code and Articles 22 and 23 of the executive order nº 15.032 of [[Uruguay]] were repealed in 2006. The articles stated that in crimes of sexual assault, statutory rape, abduction, and disrespect of modesty, the penalty would be extinguished in cases where the assailant and the victim made a matrimonial contract.&lt;ref&gt;N/A [https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N07/408/93/PDF/N0740893.pdf?OpenElement “Consideration of reports submitted by States parties under article 18 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women”] Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) – United Nations, June 21, 2007, Accessed March 14, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Red 21 [http://www.lr21.com.uy/politica/198859-derogan-articulo-del-codigo-penal-que-extinguia-delito-de-violacion-por-matrimonio-con-la-victima"Derogan artículo del Código Penal que extinguía delito de violación por matrimonio con la víctima"] La Red 21 January 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. states ===
{{See also|Age of marriage in the United States|Child marriage in the United States}}
A certain phenomenon that resembles marry-your-rapist laws exists in some [[U.S. state]]s, notably [[Missouri]] and formerly [[Florida]]. This results from loopholes in laws that allow for marriage below the [[Ages of consent in the United States|age of consent]], thus circumventing [[statutory rape]] laws.

==== Missouri ====
{{See also|Ages of consent in the United States#Missouri}}
The age of consent in Missouri is 17. According to a March 2018 article in the ''[[Journal Star (Peoria)]]'', more than 300 men aged 21 or older married with 15-year-old girls in the state of Missouri between 1999 and 2015. For the men who had premarital sex with the girls they later married, this would constitute [[statutory rape]] according to Missouri law, which defines statutory rape as "anyone 21 or older having sex with someone younger than 17 outside of marriage". However, sex is legal within marriage, even with a minor, and Missouri allows marriage from the age of 15. This creates a loophole by which statutory rape can be covered up if the marriage is concluded before the authorities find out sexual intercourse has taken place (especially if it resulted in a pregnancy). This allows for the suspect to be exempt from prosecution (for example, imprisonment and having to register as a sex offender). Social pressure could be put on the alleged victim to agree to marry her statutory rapist to make him avoid punishment. Moreover, because Missouri's age loophole, a number of out-of-state couples come to Missouri to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.pjstar.com/news/20180318/hundreds-of-missouris-15-year-old-brides-may-have-married-their-rapists |title=Hundreds of Missouri’s 15-year-old brides may have married their rapists |author=Eric Adler |work=[[Journal Star (Peoria)]] |date=18 March 2018 |accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Florida ====
{{See also|Ages of consent in the United States#Florida}}
The age of consent in Florida is 18. However, until March 2018, the state of Florida allowed marriage without any minimum age for a girl if she was pregnant and a judge approved of the marriage. In this manner, the man who impregnated her could avoid being prosecuted for statutory rape. The current law requires anyone seeking marriage to be at least 18 years old, or 17 with the other partner not being more than two years older and the minor having received parental consent; pregnancy is no longer a factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/03/10/forced-marry-her-rapist-11-woman-finally-changes-florida-marriage-law/413284002/ |title=Forced to marry her rapist at 11, woman finally changes Florida marriage law |author=Brendan Farrington |work=USA Today |date=10 March 2018 |accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|In the Ethiopian Penal Code, Articles 558 and 599 had allowed a perpetrator to be free from their crimes in the case of marriage to the victim following the incidence. In July 2004, the Ethiopian Parliament adopted a new Penal Code that is more strict and does not contain the stipulation that the perpetrator escapes punishment if he marries the victim. Before the Penal Code became law, it had to be translated into English, signed by Ethiopia's President, and published into their official gazette.&lt;ref&gt;“Ethiopia: Abduction and Rape--Law Reform and the Case of Woineshet Zebene Negash.”Equality Now, 2 Aug. 2016, www.equalitynow.org/action-alerts/ethiopia-abduction-and-rape-law-reform-and-case-woineshet-zebene-negash.&lt;/ref&gt;

| Until 1994, France kept in the French Penal Code the article that exonerated a rapist in the event of a marriage to their victim. When entered without any form of valid consent, marriage is either null or nullified domestically. The French Penal Code states that crimes committed with the intention of forcing a person to marry, or against a person that refuses to marry, will have stricter penalties.&lt;ref&gt;Lobeiras, Alicia. “The Right to Say I Don't: Forced Marriage as Persecution in the United Kingdom, Spain, and France.” Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, vol. 52, 1 Jan. 2014, pp. 896–931.

Article 522 allowed for halting the prosecution or suspending the conviction of a person who had committed rape, kidnapping, or statutory rape if he married the victim. The repeal was seen as a "partial victory" as Article 505, which involves sex with a minor who is 15 years of age, and Article 518, which concerns the seduction of a minor with the promise of marriage, continue to provide exoneration if a marriage takes place.&lt;ref name="BBC16Aug17"/&gt;

'''Mary Margaret Bartelme''' (July 24, 1866 – July 25, 1954) was the first woman appointed [[Cook County Public Guardian]] in Illinois and the first woman elected judge in a court of high jurisdiction in that state.

==Early years==
Mary Bartelme was born in [[Chicago]], the daughter of an immigrant from [[Saarland]], Germany Balthasar Bartelme and his wife Jeannette.  She had three sisters and two brothers, and attended West Division High School. She graduated from Chicago Normal School, a teachers' college, and taught for five years,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Suitcase Mary, Famous Illinois Judge, Dies at 88|last=|first=|date=26 July 1954|work=Corsicana (TX) Daily Sun|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; before deciding to attend law school, at the age of 25.  In 1892, she enrolled at [[Northwestern University School of Law]], from which she graduated; she was admitted to the Illinois Bar by 1894. [http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/specialcoll/services/rjd/findingaids/MBartelmeb.html]

==Professional career==
Known as a social reformer, during the [[Progressive Era]], Mary Bartelme devoted much of her life to the reform of juvenile laws and the welfare of children.  In 1897, she was named [[Cook County Public Guardian]], the first woman in this post.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Judge Mary Bartelme, 88, Dies in West|last=|first=|date=26 July 1954|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became known throughout Illinois as a tireless advocate for children; her compassion for the girls who came before her earned her the nickname "Mother Barthelme."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Miss Mary Bartelme to Serve as Judge|last=|first=|date=26 December 1912|work=Connellsville (PA) Daily Courier|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would later acquire another nickname-- "Suitcase Mary," because when she sent girls to foster homes, she always provided them with clean clothes, packed in a new suitcase.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bartelme believed that there was dramatic social neglect of girls, that parents must speak frankly with their daughters about sex, and that poverty was the main cause of delinquency. In May 1912, she was named an Assistant Judge in the Juvenile Court of Cook County.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Woman is Named Juvenile Judge.|last=|first=|date=1 June 1912|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in March 1913 Bartelme convened a special Girls' Court, which heard cases of delinquent and dependent girls, many of them prostitutes. All personnel in this closed court were female, which was felt to encourage a more open discussion of sexual and other private matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Girls Court in Chicago|last=|first=|date=5 March 1913|work=Albert Lea (MN) Evening Tribune|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartelme later established three Mary Clubs for girls who were not able to return to their parents, supported by volunteer services, as an alternative to state institutions. The first two clubs, which started in 1914 and 1916, accepted white girls; the last one, started in 1921, accepted girls of color. More than 2,000 girls passed through these group homes in a space of ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A Century of Juvenile Justice |veditors=Roesnheim MK, Zimring FE, Tanenhaus DS, Dohrn B |author= Dohrn B |chapter= The school, the child, and the court |pages=267–309 |isbn=0-226-72783-1 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1923, she was elected Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, and she was re-elected in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Mary Barthelme First Woman Judge in Illinois Courts|last=|first=|date=7 November 1923|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a distinguished career, she retired in June 1933.  Prior to her official retirement, in May, more than 2000 well-wishers honored her with a luncheon, at which she was praised for her many achievements.

==Later years==

After she retired, Judge Bartelme moved to the west coast, residing in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel, California]], where she lived with a niece. She occasionally returned to Chicago for a visit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In California, she continued to do speaking engagements, discussing the need to improve the juvenile justice system.  She died in late July 1954, at age 88.  One of her final requests was that upon her death, in lieu of flowers, donations would be made to the Mary Bartelme Clubs, which were still in operation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mary Bartelme would later be described as the single most important person in the first 25 years of the Cook County Juvenile Court, the first juvenile court established in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Mother knows best: Mary Margaret Bartelme and the Chicago juvenile reform movement |author= Burton K |year=2002 |url=http://womenslegalhistory.stanford.edu/papers0203/kburton-BartelmeF02.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In September 1957, a new Chicago elementary school that was named for her opened.  It was able to accommodate more than 400 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Mary Bartelme Elementary School to House 435|last=|first=|date=29 August 1957|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was located on Ridge in Rogers Park.  It was torn down sometime in the 1970s to make way for a senior citizen apartment home.

Mary Bartelme Park, in the West Loop area of Chicago, is also named in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks-facilities/bartelme-mary-park |title=Bartelme (Mary) Park |website=Chicago Park District |language=en |access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''master''' is a judge in the courts of England and in numerous other jurisdictions based on the common law tradition. A master's jurisdiction is generally confined to civil proceedings and is a subset of that of a justice.  Masters are typically involved in hearing trials, case management, and in some jurisdictions dispute resolution or adjudication of specific issues referred by judges.

Besides the courts of England and Wales, masters may be found in the [[Republic of Ireland]], Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, several Caribbean countries and a number of [[Canada|Canadian]] [[province]]s. Several state courts in the United States utilize masters or similar officers and also make extensive use of [[special master]]s.

Judicial officials exercising a master's jurisdiction are in some jurisdictions referred to as [[Registrar (law)|Registrars]] and Deputy Registrars.

==England and Wales==
{{see also|Judiciary of England and Wales#Masters and Registrars}}
In England and Wales a master is a sworn judge in the High Court having a jurisdiction similar to that of a Justice of the High Court in civil matters within the division of the court to which the master is appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2018/692.html|title=Abdule v UK state|website=bailii.org|accessdate=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of a master in the [[High Court of Justice]] of [[England and Wales]] is concerned primarily with trial and case management of High Court civil claims in London excluding committals to prison, judicial review and criminal cases. There are masters in the Queen's Bench and Chancery Divisions and the Costs Office (Taxing Masters/Costs Judges) and their roles differ slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2018/692.html|title=Queen's Bench Masters' status, jurisdiction and origins|website=bailii.org|accessdate=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gov.uk/guidance/courts-and-tribunals/courts/chancery-division/chancery-chambers.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a person is addressed in court as, for example, "Master Smith".  This is so whether the master is male or female, or as either 'Master' or 'Judge'.  A similar type of master exists in the [[Courts of Northern Ireland|Court system of Northern Ireland]], in several Canadian and Australian jurisdictions as well as in other countries whose court system is based on that of England.

The office of master is of ancient origins dating from at least the 12th century, though masters in Chancery were abolished in the 19th century and a new office of Chancery Master was recreated later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2018/692.html|title=Abdule v UK state|website=bailii.org|accessdate=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are masters in the Chancery and Queen's Bench divisions of the High Court of Justice and the Costs Office of the High Court. The Senior Master of the Queen's Bench Division also bears the title of [[Queen's Remembrancer]] which is one of the oldest judicial offices in England.

In the [[Inns of Court]], the members of the governing body are known as "Masters of the Bench" or, more commonly, "benchers". In the context of the functions they perform in that capacity (but not otherwise) they will be known as, for example, "Master Smith" (whether they are male or female).  This will be so even if in other contexts they use a higher title:  hence, a High Court Judge who is a Master of the Bench will be known in his or her Inn as "Master Smith", in private life as Sir John Smith, and on the bench as Mr Justice Smith; likewise a law lord will be known in the inn as "Master Woolf" even if he is privately and professionally known by the peerage title of "Lord Woolf".

==Hong Kong==

The [[High Court of Hong Kong|High Court]]'s Registrar, Senior Deputy Registrars and Deputy Registrars serve as Masters of the High Court in civil cases in the court's Court of First Instance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yearbook.gov.hk/2001/ehtml/03/03-08f.htm 2001 Hong Kong Government Year Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republic of Ireland==
Under the Court Officers Act 1926, the [[Master of the High Court (Ireland)|Master of the High Court]] and [[taxing master]]s are not judges but rather "[[Quasi-judicial proceedings|quasi-judicial]] office holders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://aji.ie/judiciary/who_are_the_judiciary|title=Who are the Judiciary?|work=Association of Judges of Ireland|accessdate=17 January 2016|quote=Contrary to a misconception sometimes held, neither the Master of the High Court nor the Taxing Masters are members of the judiciary.

==Canada==
In Canada the structure of the court system is primarily a provincial responsibility{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} and the superior courts of the provinces have different names.  Masters are found in the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]], [[Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta]], the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba and the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]]. There are part-time taxing masters in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador. There is a similar office of prothonotary in the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island and in the Federal Court.

The jurisdiction of a Master is fixed by provincial [[statute]] and the rules of court. Masters are appointed by the provincial government. As a result, while Masters sit in a superior court, they do not have the "inherent jurisdiction" of the judges of those courts, who are appointed by the [[Government of Canada|federal]] government and whose authority is derived from the [[Constitution of Canada]] and the Crown. Their jurisdiction is usually limited to procedural and [[Interlocutory]] matters heard in [[Chambers (law)|chambers]]. Consequently, though of the superior court, Masters are concurrently subordinate to the judges of that court insofar as application of judicial precedent is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;http://whois.incourt.ca/judicial-pecking-order/ Judicial Pecking Order&lt;/ref&gt; Masters commonly also sit as Registrars in Bankruptcy.

In the Federal Court of Canada, a judicial officer with much the same powers as a Master is called a [[Prothonotary]].

Traditionally a Master is referred to as "Master Smith" or, in court, as "Master". In some jurisdictions, Masters are now referred to as "your honour".

Masters and Prothonotaries are independent judicial officers although they do not have the full level of security of tenure afforded to federally appointed judges.

In Alberta, British Columbia and Manitoba, masters have the same terms of appointment as provincial judges.  This was formerly the case in Ontario as well but after the High Court of Justice and District Courts were merged, in 1986 a new office of Case Management Master was created.

In Ontario Case Management Masters have all of the authority of traditional masters as well as additional jurisdiction to manage actions and engage in dispute resolution processes. They are appointed by Order in Council and can only be removed for cause by the Chief Justice following a formal disciplinary process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90c43_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ontario the distinction between "chambers" and "court" has been abolished. When masters preside they sit as the court and their function is to perform tasks that would otherwise fall to superior court judges.  Besides the jurisdiction to hear most interlocutory motions in civil matters, case management masters in Ontario also preside at status hearings, case conferences and pre-trials. They frequently act as referees to hear trials in construction lien matters, mortgage references or issues referred by judges. Case management masters also provide dispute resolution services and sit as Registrars in Bankruptcy.

==New Zealand==
In the [[High Court of New Zealand]], Associate Judges perform the same role as Masters in the High Court of Justice in England and Wales.  They were previously referred to as Masters, however the title was changed on 20 May 2004, and all existing Masters were renamed Associate Judges.

==Fiji==
{{main|Master of the High Court of Fiji}}
The Masters are the junior judges on the [[High Court of Fiji]].

== Background ==
Before the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] in Washington D.C.,&lt;ref name=case1&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In re Tam |vol=808 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1321 |pinpoint= |court=Fed.

This case was heard on appeal after [[Simon Tam (musician)|Simon Tam]] applied for a [[trademark]] registration on the mark "[[The Slants]]" for his band from the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (PTO) and was denied.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref name=harv&gt;[https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/243-252_Online.pdf ''The Supreme Court, 2016 Term — Leading Cases''], 131 Harv. L. Rev. 243 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The PTO interpreted the likely meaning of "The Slants" as a term to refer to people of Asian descent, despite claims from the band that the actual meaning referred to their perspective&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-02|title=The Slants|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Slants&amp;oldid=833843152|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that they were repurposing the term from an offensive slur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/opinion/the-power-of-repurposing-a-slur.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Slants on the Power of Repurposing a Slur|date=2017-06-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PTO used anecdotal sources like [[Urban Dictionary]] to support their claims, while ignoring survey data, linguistics experts, and legal declarations from Asian American community leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/magazine/should-we-be-able-to-reclaim-a-racist-insult-as-a-registered-trademark.html|title=Should We Be Able to Reclaim a Racist Insult — as a Registered Trademark?|last=Jeong|first=Sarah|date=2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/10/20/236235813/asian-american-band-fights-to-trademark-name-the-slants|title=Asian-American Band Fights To Trademark Name 'The Slants'|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/asian-american-group-the-slants-head-to-supreme-court-w460214|title=Asian-American Group The Slants Head to Supreme Court Over Band Name|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion was heard [[en banc]] by the Federal Circuit and the majority, which was written by [[Kimberly Ann Moore|Circuit Judge Moore]], determined that the Disparaging Provision ({{uscsub|15|1052|a}}) of the [[Lanham Act]] is [[unconstitutional]] and found that [[Simon Tam (musician)|Simon Tam]] was entitled to trademark registration.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2265-2272-Online.pdf ''Recent Case: Federal Circuit Holds the Lanham Act's Antidisparagement Provision Unconstitutional''], 129 Harv. L. Rev. 2265 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Tam was represented by John C. Connell of Archer &amp; Greiner and [[Ron Coleman (legal scholar)|Ron Coleman]] and Joel MacMull, now of Mandelbaum Salsburg.

The United States government petitioned the [[United States Supreme Court]] for [[writ]] of [[certiorari]], which was granted in September 2016.  In addition to this case, there was another case before the Fourth Circuit, ''[[Washington Redskins|Pro-Football, Inc.]] v. [[Amanda Blackhorse|Blackhorse]]'', 112 F. Supp. 3d 439 (E.D. Va. 2015) to decide the same issue of whether or not the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;DISPARAGING TRADEMARKS: The case of “in re Tam” and its current impact, Potente: A Professional Law Corporation, http://potentelaw.com/disparaging-trademarks-case-re-tam-current-impact/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Government Can't Deny Trademarks Over Offensive Names, Appeals Court Rules, NPR, https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/12/22/460692655/government-cant-deny-trademarks-over-offensive-names-appeals-court-rules&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an attempt by Pro Football to merge the two cases, the Supreme Court refused to grant the motion. 

Section 2(a)'s ban on the federal registration of "immoral" or "scandalous" marks originated in the trademark legislation of the Lanham Act. A disparaging mark is a mark which "dishonors by comparison with what is inferior, slights, deprecates, degrades, or affects or injures by unjust comparison."&lt;ref&gt;''In re Geller'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3330786945440697276&amp;q=808+F.3d+1321&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,41&amp;as_vis=1 751 F.3d 1355], 1358 (2014)(alterations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Tam (musician)|Simon Tam]] is the founder and bassist for the Asian-American dance-rock band [[The Slants]]. Tam named his band The Slants to "reclaim" and "take ownership" of Asian stereotypes. On March 5, 2010, Tam filed his first application to register THE SLANTS. After several appeals, the application was eventually abandoned. On November 14, 2011, Tam filed his second application (App. No. 85/472,044) seeking to register the mark THE SLANTS for "Entertainment in the nature of live performances by a musical band," based on his use of the mark since 2006. The examiner refused to register Tam's mark, finding it likely disparaging to "persons of Asian descent" under § 2(a). The examiner found that the mark likely referred to people of Asian descent in a disparaging way, explaining that the term "slants" had "a long history of being used to deride and mock a physical feature" of people of Asian descent. The examiner found that a substantial composite of persons of Asian descent might find the term offensive&lt;ref name="''id.''"&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt; precisely because it was being used by an Asian American band, saying: “Here, the evidence is uncontested that applicant is a founding member of a band that is self described as being composed of members of Asian descent...Thus, the association of the term SLANTS with those of Asian descent is evidenced by how the applicant uses the work - '''as the name of an all Asian-American band.'''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ex-parte-appeal-brief-of-simon-tam-of-th-95764/|title=In re Simon Shiao Tam - Ex Parte Appeal Brief of Simon Tam of the PTO's Refusal to Register THE SLANTS Trademark {{!}} JD Supra|work=JD Supra|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to this determination, Tam decided to appeal before the Federal Circuit.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;

== Relevant Areas of Law ==

=== Lanham Act's Disparaging Provision ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it—&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(a) Consists of or comprises immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter; or matter which may disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute; or a geographical indication which, when used on or in connection with wines or spirits, identifies a place other than the origin of the goods and is first used on or in connection with wines or spirits by the applicant on or after one year after the date on which the WTO Agreement (as defined in section 3501(9) of title 19) enters into force with respect to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|15|1052|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Viewpoint Discrimination ===

Viewpoint discrimination occurs when the government is not only banning certain content or topics, but certain ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd.'', [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/502/105/case.html 502 U.S. 105], 116 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The test for viewpoint discrimination is “[o]ther things being equal, viewpoint discrimination occurs when government allows one message while prohibiting the messages of those who can reasonably be expected to respond.”&lt;ref&gt;''Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of the Univ. of Va.'', [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/515/819/case.html 515 U.S. 819], 894 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, viewpoint discrimination involves intent to discourage one viewpoint and advance another.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Kokinda'', [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/497/720/case.html 497 U.S. 720], 736 (1990) (citing ''Monterey County Democratic Cent. Comm. v. United States Postal Serv.'', [http://openjurist.org/812/f2d/1194/monterey-county-democratic-central-committee 812 F.2d 1194], 1198-1199 (9th Cir. 1987)).&lt;/ref&gt; The general concern being that the government will try to eradicate, not just content from the marketplace, but certain viewpoints—whether positive or negative.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Tam'', 808 F.3d at 1334-35.&lt;/ref&gt; If something rises to the level of viewpoint-based discrimination, it is deemed to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''Sons of Confederate Veterans v. Comm'r of the Va. Dept. of Motor Vehicles'', [http://openjurist.org/288/f3d/610/sons-of-confederate-veterans-incorporated-griffin 288 F.3d 610], 623 (4th Cir. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Content Discrimination ===

In ''[[Reed v. Town of Gilbert]]'', the court said that, “Government regulation of speech is content based if a law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.”&lt;ref&gt;''Reed v. Town of Gilbert'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-502_9olb.pdf 135 S. Ct. 2218], 2227 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court further determined that, “This commonsense meaning of the phrase ‘content based’ requires a court to consider whether a regulation of speech ‘on its face’ draws distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys.”&lt;ref&gt;''Reed'', 135 S. Ct. at 2227 (citing ''Sorrell'', 131 S. Ct. 2653, 2663, 180 L. Ed. 2d
544-55).&lt;/ref&gt; For that reason, content-based discrimination is presumptively invalid&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; and if something is found to be discriminating on the basis of content, it must survive strict scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Pleasant Grove City v. Summum]]'', [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/555/460/ 555 U.S. 460], 469 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strict Scrutiny ===

According to Nat’l Assoc. of Mfrs. v. Taylor: “[t]o satisfy strict scrutiny, the government must establish three elements: (1) "the interests the government proffers in support" of the statute must be "properly characterized as 'compelling'"; (2) the statute must "effectively advance [] those interests"; and (3) the statute must be "narrowly tailored to advance the compelling interests asserted."&lt;ref&gt;''Nat’l Assoc. of Mfrs. v. Taylor'', 582 F.3d 1, 11 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (citing ''Blount v. SEC'', [https://openjurist.org/61/f3d/938 61 F.3d 938], 943, 314 U.S. App. D.C. 52 (D.C. Cir. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Central Hudson (Intermediate Scrutiny) ===

For ''[[Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission|Central Hudson]]'' to apply, the court would have to determine that the statute at issue deals with commercial speech.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Cent. Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n, 447 U.S. 557 (1980) (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/447/557/).&lt;/ref&gt; From ''Central Hudson'', the Supreme Court developed a four-part test to determine whether a statute should pass muster.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt; The test looks to see: (1) Whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment—for it to fall here, it must concern lawful activity and not be misleading; (2) whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial; (3) whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted; and (4) whether the regulation is no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest—there must be a “reasonable fit” between the government's ends and the means of achieving those ends.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;

=== Government Speech ===

In order for something to be classified as government speech, the court looks at four factors: (1) the central purpose of the program in which the speech in question occurs; (2) the degree of editorial control exercised by the government or private entities over the content of the speech; (3) the identity of the literal speaker; and (4) whether the government or the private entity bears the ultimate responsibility for the content of the speech.&lt;ref&gt;''Pro-Football, Inc. v. Blackhorse'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14145695784392572141&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr 112 F. Supp. 3d 439], 460, (E.D. Va. 2015) (citing ''Sons of Confederate Veterans v. Vehicles'', 288 F.3d at 618).&lt;/ref&gt;

The central issue before the Federal Circuit was to determine whether or not the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional and should therefore be voided.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Under the case name ''In Re Tam'', 808 F.3d 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2015), Circuit Judge Moore decided that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional for various reasons and that Tam should be granted trademark protection on THE SLANTS.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asian-American band “The Slants” overturns USPTO rule on “disparaging” trademarks, ARS Technica, https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/12/federal-circuit-judges-say-rule-against-disparaging-trademarks-is-unconstitutional/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viewpoint v. Content-Based Discrimination ===

The court determined that the Lanham Act was viewpoint-based discriminatory because whenever the government chooses to deny trademark protection to a mark, it is doing so because of the message the mark conveys.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The government tried to defend their position before the Federal Circuit by saying that they should be able to deny protection to the most "vile" racial epithets and images; however, the Federal Circuit said that "When the government discriminates against speech because it disapproves of the message conveyed by the speech, it discriminates on the basis of viewpoint."&lt;ref&gt;''In Re Tam'', 808 F.3d 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (citing ''Sorrell'', 131 S.Ct. at 2664).&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Circuit bolstered their stance that it is viewpoint discriminatory because the PTO refused to register "The Slants"; however, the PTO has registered marks such as "Celebrasians" and "Asian Efficiency".&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The Federal Circuit found the only difference between marks such as "The Slants" versus "Celebrasians" and "Asian Efficiency" is the messages conveyed. The Slants could be seen as being derogatory towards those of Asian descent versus positive. Since the court determined that the disparaging provision is viewpoint discriminatory, then it is immediately unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

In the alternative, the Federal Circuit determined that the disparaging provision is content-based discriminatory, in addition to viewpoint-discriminatory.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Additionally, the Federal Circuit came to the determination that even though trademarks inherently deal more with commercial speech versus expressive speech, that when the government cancels a mark under the disparaging provision, it is affecting more of the expressive aspects of speech and not the commerciality of it.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Therefore, the Federal Circuit found that if the disparaging provision is not found to be viewpoint discriminatory (in light of a higher court potentially overturning parts of this case) that it must be content-based discriminatory and must survive strict scrutiny unless an exception applied.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Federal appeals court decides ‘The Slants’ case: excluding ‘disparaging marks’ from trademark registration violates the First Amendment, Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/12/22/federal-appeals-court-decides-the-slants-case-excluding-disparaging-marks-from-trademark-registration-violates-the-first-amendment/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strict Scrutiny v. Intermediate Scrutiny (Central Hudson) ===

The government raised the argument that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act should be reviewed under intermediate scrutiny by way of the ''Central Hudson'' test, because the inherent nature of trademarks are commercial.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; However, the Federal Circuit determined that when the PTO chooses to cancel trademarks under the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act, it is usually because of their expressive components and not their commercial components.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The Federal Circuit went on to say that commercial speech mixed with expressive speech should be treated as expressive under deciding whether to apply strict or intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Therefore, the Federal Circuit decided that strict scrutiny should be applied.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanynes Boone"&gt;Philip G. Hampton, II, Scott Benfield, &amp; Alexander B. Lutzky (January 5, 2016). "Federal Circuit Rules Disparagement Clause of §2(a) of the Lanham Act Unconstitutional". Haynes Boone, [http://www.haynesboone.com/news-and-events/news/alerts/2016/01/05/federal-circuit-rules-disparagement-clause-of-2a-of-the-lanham-act-unconstitutional http://www.haynesboone.com/news-and-events/news/alerts/2016/01/05/federal-circuit-rules-disparagement-clause-of-2a-of-the-lanham-act-unconstitutional].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Federal Circuit's Analysis under ''Central Hudson'' ====

In the Federal Circuit's effort to show the unconstitutionality of the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act, they chose to analyze the provision under the ''Central Hudson'' intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The part of the ''Central Hudson'' test that the Federal Circuit failed the Lanham Act on was the "legitimate Interest" element (See above).

For this element, the government raised three arguments for why they had a legitimate interest:
# The Government argued that they have a legitimate interest to dissociate itself from speech it finds odious. 
# The Government argued that it has a legitimate interest in "declining to expend its resources to facilitate the use of racial slurs as source identifiers in interstate commerce".
# The Government also argued that it has a legitimate interest in allowing States to make their own determinations about whether trademarks should be unenforceable on grounds of public policy.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

The Federal Circuit determined that none of the arguments raised by the government created a legitimate enough interest to pass the ''Central Hudson'' test. Since it does not pass the ''Central Hudson'' test, the Federal Circuit determined that it would also not pass strict scrutiny, since strict scrutiny requires a statute to rise to a higher standard.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

=== Government Subsidy ===

The Government raised the argument that the Lanham Act should be classified as a Government Subsidy and therefore exempt from the strict scrutiny requirement.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The Federal Circuit ultimately determined that no taxpayer dollars are used in registering trademarks, that it is completely user-funded in their application fees; therefore, the Federal Circuit determined that this does not fall under the government subsidy exception to strict scrutiny.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;

=== Government Speech ===

The Government also raised the argument that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is government speech and should therefore fall outside of the purview of the first amendment.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The government argues this because of the ability to place the "®" or "TM" on the registered mark.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The government found this argument to be without merit.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The Federal Circuit said that the only message the government conveys when a mark is registered with the PTO is that "a mark is registered."&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The court cited many reasons for their determination, but, most prominently, was a policy consideration.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The Court was concerned that if they allowed this argument to win the day, then it would also affect other areas of law, such as Copyright and Patent law.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The general concern being that the government could then control what they would and would not grant protections to and would therefore affect the types of speech expressed; this would have the effect of abridging free speech, which is a violation of the first amendment.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

=== Concurrence by Judge O'Malley ===

In addition to agreeing with Circuit Judge Moore's opinion, Judge O'Malley added that she believes the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional under the vagueness doctrine too.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

=== Part Concurrence &amp; Part Dissent by Judge Dyk ===

Circuit Judge Dyk generally agrees with the opinion of the majority in that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional; however, in his view, the majority err in going "beyond the facts of this case and holding the statute facially unconstitutional as applied to purely commercial speech."&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Judge Dyk also believed that many trademarks lack expressive characteristics that would merit First Amendment protection and therefore the analysis should be under the ''Central Hudson'' test and not strict scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanynes Boone"/&gt;

=== Dissent by Judge Lourie ===

Judge Lourie disagreed with the majority in many ways outlined below:
* Judge Lourie argued that the Lanham Act has dated back 70 years, it has been continuously applied during that time and it now being found to be unconstitutional seems bizarre.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Judge Lourie cites to ''stare decisis'' as the first reason why the majority made a mistake.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eriq Gardner (December 22, 2015). "Rock Band Wins First Amendment Appeal Over 'Disparaging' Trademarks". Hollywood Reporter, [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/rock-band-wins-first-amendment-850689 http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/rock-band-wins-first-amendment-850689].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Additionally, Judge Lourie said that denial of an applicant's trademark does not deny their right to speak freely.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Contending that the mark holder may still generally use the mark as it wishes; without federal registration, "it simply lacks access to certain federal statutory enforcement mechanisms for excusing others from confusingly similar uses of the mark."&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;
* Judge Lourie also said that there are other ways for the mark holder to have protections, including common law rights.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brent Kendall (December 22, 2015). "Government Can’t Reject Trademarks for Being Offensive, Court Says". Wall Street Journal, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-cant-reject-trademarks-for-being-disparaging-or-offensive-court-says-1450809668 https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-cant-reject-trademarks-for-being-disparaging-or-offensive-court-says-1450809668].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Finally, Judge Lourie also determined that trademarks are exclusively commercial speech and should therefore not be analyzed under strict scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

=== Dissent by Judge Reyna ===

Judge Reyna disagreed with the majority in the sense that trademark are exclusively commercial speech and should therefore be analyzed under the ''Central Hudson'' test and intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; From here, Judge Reyna determined that the government does have a legitimate interest in promoting the orderly flow of commerce and therefore, should pass intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Judge Reyna stated that when you balance the legitimate interest of the disparaging provision versus how narrowly tailored the statute is, that it makes sense that the Lanham Act should survive scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

}}
The United States Patent and Trademark Office appealed the decision to the United States Supreme Court, presenting the following question in its petition for [[certiorari]]: "whether the disparagement provision in 15 U.S.C. 1052(a) is facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment"?&lt;ref&gt;''Lee v. Tam'', No. 15-1293, [http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Petition-for-writ_Michelle-K.-Lee-Director-United-States-Patent-and-Trademark-Office-Petitioner-v.-Simon-Shiao-Tam.pdf Pet. for Certiorari] at ''I''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court agreed to grant certiorari in September 2016.&lt;ref name="SCOTUS docket"&gt;Docket No. 15-1293, Supreme Court of the United States, [https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1293.htm https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1293.htm] (last accessed June 3, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Oral arguments were heard on January 18, 2017.&lt;ref name="SCOTUS docket"/&gt; 

On June 19, 2017 the Supreme Court delivered judgment in favor of Tam, voting unanimously to affirm the lower court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Justices Strike Down Law Banning Disparaging Trademarks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/us/politics/supreme-court-trademarks-redskins.html|accessdate=5 December 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 June 2017|page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/supreme-court-review/2017/9/2017-supreme-court-review-1.pdf Clay Calvert, ''Beyond Trademarks and Offense:'' Tam ''and the Justices’ Evolution on Free Speech''], 2016–2017 Cato Sup. Ct. Rev. 105 (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The majority opinion stated "The disparagement clause violates the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause. Contrary to the Government’s contention, trademarks are private, not government speech."&lt;ref name="SCOTUS"/&gt;

This decision is another ruling that strikes down '[[Hate speech#United States|Hate Speech]]' laws that violate the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause. Justice Samuel Alito writes in this unanimous decision:&lt;blockquote&gt;Speech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express “the thought that we hate.” ''United States ''v. ''Schwimmer'', 279 U. S. 644, 655 (1929) (Holmes, J., dissenting).&lt;ref name="SCOTUS"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Justice [[Neil Gorsuch]] was not yet a member of the court during the oral argument, so he did not participate in the decision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2085">{{About|the legal procedure|the 2017 South Korean film|New Trial (film)}}

A '''new trial''' or '''retrial''' is a recurrence of a court case.  Depending on the rules of the jurisdiction, a new [[trial]] may occur if:
*a jury is unable to reach a verdict (see [[hung jury]]);
*a trial court grants a party's motion for a new trial, usually on the grounds of a legal defect in the original trial; or
*an appellate court reverses a judgment under circumstances requiring that the case be tried again.

In some types of cases (for example, if the original trial court was not a [[court of record]]) or in some legal systems, if the losing party to a case appeals, then the appellate court itself will hold a new trial, known as a [[trial de novo|trial ''de novo'']].

In the [[United States]], if a defendant is acquitted of a crime, the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] generally prohibits a retrial; thus, with few exceptions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

In other legal systems, the rules may be different. For example, in Canada, the Crown (prosecution) may seek leave to appeal an acquittal; if such an appeal is successful, a retrial may be ordered. &lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-175.html#h-247 ''Criminal Code'' (Canada), (R.S.C., 1985, c.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4877">An '''omnibus bill''' is a proposed law that covers a number of diverse or unrelated topics. ''Omnibus'' is derived from Latin and means "for everything". An omnibus bill is a single document that is accepted in a single vote by a [[legislature]] but packages together several measures into one or combines diverse subjects.

Because of their large size and scope, omnibus bills limit opportunities for debate and scrutiny. Historically, omnibus bills have sometimes been used to pass controversial amendments. For this reason, some consider omnibus bills to be anti-democratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/06/18/omnibus-bills-in-hill-history|title=Omnibus bills in Hill history|date=18 June 2012|work=Lorne Gunter|publisher=Sun Media|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
In the United States, examples include reconciliation bills, combined appropriations bills, and private relief and claims bills.

=== Appropriations legislation ===
{{Main|Omnibus spending bill}}
Omnibus legislation is routinely used by the [[United States Congress]] to group together the budgets of all departments in one year in an omnibus spending bill.  For example, the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]] was designed to help reduce the federal deficit by approximately $496 billion over five years through restructuring of the tax code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.realestateagent.com/real-estate-glossary/insurance/omnibus-budget-reconciliation-act-of-.html|title=Omnibus act 1993|website=Real Estate Agent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical examples ===
During the 19th century, there were three notable omnibus bills.

The [[Compromise of 1850]] had five disparate provisions designed by Sen. Henry Clay of Kentucky. His purpose was to pacify sectional differences that threatened to provoke the secession of the slave states. The [[Fugitive Slave Act]] was the most infamous of the five compromise components, and was almost universally excoriated by [[abolitionists]], the chief exception being Sen. [[Daniel Webster]] of Massachusetts who prioritized preservation of the Union. Sen. Thomas Hart Benton, a Missouri slaveholder, opposed the omnibus compromise as an "unmanageable mass of incongruous bills, each an impediment to the other...."&lt;ref&gt;John F. Kennedy, ''Profiles in Courage'' (1956), chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the bill passed Congress and accomplished its purpose. Disunion and civil war were delayed for a decade.

The Omnibus Act of June 1868 admitted seven southern States as having satisfied the requirements of the [[Reconstruction Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;Arkansas (on June 22, 1868), Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina (on June 25, 1868).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Omnibus Act of February 22, 1889, provided for the admission of four new states to the Union — North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and Washington.

== Other countries ==
In Canada one famous omnibus bill became the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69]], a 126-page, 120-clause amendment to the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], which dealt with issues as diverse as [[homosexuality]], [[prostitution]], [[abortion]], [[gambling]], [[gun control]] and [[drunk driving]]. Likewise, [[Jobs and Growth Act]] (2012).  In the Republic of Ireland, the [[Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Second Amendment of the Constitution]] was an omnibus constitutional law, enacted in 1941, that made many unrelated changes to the country's fundamental law.

Similarly, in New Zealand, an omnibus bill was passed in November 2016 that enacted legislation required for New Zealand to enter the [[Trans Pacific Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/295837/govt-to-limit-labour-position-on-tpp-bill |title= Govt to limit Labour position on TPP bill |date=5 Feb 2016|work=Patrick O'Meara, Economics Correspondent |publisher=RNZ|accessdate=7 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/new-zealand-trans-pacific-partnership-bill-passed/|title=New Zealand: Trans-Pacific Partnership Bill Passed|date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Section 55 of the Constitution of Australia]] requires that laws imposing taxation "deal only with the imposition of taxation" and "deal with one subject of taxation only" (except those relating to customs and excise); other purported provisions in a piece of tax legislation are of no legal effect. This does not outlaw all omnibus bills, but renders unconstitutional any omnibus bill imposing taxation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Australia]], s. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Protect Our Children''' (also called '''Operation Save Our Children''') was a 2011 [[joint operation]] by [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], and the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]'s [[Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section]] and Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section to execute "seizure warrants against 10 domain names of websites engaged in the advertisement and distribution of child pornography".&lt;ref name="dhs"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Joint DHS-DOJ "Operation Protect Our Children" Seizes Website Domains Involved in Advertising and Distributing Child Pornography|url=https://www.dhs.gov/ynews/releases/pr_1297804574965.shtm|date=February 15, 2011|accessdate=2011-02-18|work=Press Release|publisher=DHS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enforcement action was spearheaded by ICE’s Cyber Crimes Center (C3).&lt;ref name="dhs"/&gt;

One of the domains seized, mooo.com, belonged to the DNS provider [[FreeDNS]]. FreeDNS stated that on "February 11th at around 9:30 PM PST mooo.com (the most popular shared domain at afraid.org) was suspended at the registrar level."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=News!|url=http://freedns.afraid.org/news/|date=2011-02-12&lt;!-- 07:07:07--&gt;|accessdate=2011-02-18|publisher=Afraid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 84,000 of mooo.com's [[subdomain]]s were subsequently redirected to a warning which stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This domain name has been seized by ICE – Homeland Security Investigations pursuant to a seizure warrant issued by a United States District Court under the authority of Title 18 U.S.C. 2254.
&lt;br&gt;
Advertisement, distribution, transportation, receipt, and possession of child pornography constitute federal crimes that carry penalties for first time offenders of up to 30 years in federal prison, a $250,000 fine, forfeiture and restitution.&lt;ref name="tth"&gt;{{Cite web|title=84,000 websites wrongly culled for child pornography|url=http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201107/6836/84-000-websites-wrongly-culled-for-child-pornography|first=Mostyn|last=Steven |date=Feb 18, 2011&lt;!--, 09:10--&gt;|accessdate=2011-02-18|publisher=The Tech Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Service to mooo.com was restored on February 13 at around 7:15 p.m, although FreeDNS admins noted that it would take up to 3 days for [[domain propagation]].  This meant that the affected sites would be unusable and would continue to display the child pornography accusation.&lt;ref name="pc"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Feds Wrongly Links 84,000 Seized Sites to Child Porn|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/220113/feds_wrongly_links_84000_seized_sites_to_child_porn.html|first=Ted|last=Samson|date=Feb 18, 2011&lt;!-- 3:54 pm--&gt;|accessdate=2011-02-18|publisher=InfoWorld/PC World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was initially unclear whether the entire mooo.com domain was shut down due to clerical error or intentionally, ICE later apologized for the seizure stating, "During the course of a joint DHS and DOJ law enforcement operation targeting 10 websites providing explicit child pornographic content, a higher level domain name and linked sites were inadvertently seized for a period of time."&lt;ref name="hf"&gt;{{Cite web|title=U.S. Anti-Child Pornography Operation Accidentally Shuts Down 84,000 Sites|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/17/sites-shut-down_n_824145.html|first=Amy|last=Lee|date=02/17/11 08:17 AM|accessdate=2011-02-18|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lawful Websites Seized in U.S. Operation Against Child Porn|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-18/lawful-websites-seized-in-u-s-operation-against-child-porn.html|first=Eric |last=Engleman|date=Feb 18, 2011&lt;!-- 6:50 PM ET --&gt;|accessdate=2011-02-25|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=ICE Confirms Inadvertent Web Site Seizures|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/vulnerabilities/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=229218959|first=Thomas |last=Claburn|date=February 18, 2011&lt;!-- 02:20 PM --&gt;|accessdate=2011-02-25|publisher=InformationWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excessive seizure has led to criticism of the DOJ's [[ex parte]] warrant process and its possible abuse.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Operation Protect Our Children Accidentally Shutters 84,000 Sites|url=http://techland.time.com/2011/02/17/operation-protect-our-children-accidentally-shutters-84000-sites/|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=2011-02-18|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Government Accidentally Abuses Internet "Kill Switch", Shuts off 84,000 Sites|url=http://www.dailytech.com/US+Government+Accidentally+Abuses+Internet+Kill+Switch+Shuts+off+84000+Sites/article20934.htm|first=Jason|last=Mick|date=February 17, 2011&lt;!-- 10:53 AM--&gt;|publisher=DailyTech|accessdate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Probate]] research''' deals with finding [[heirs]] and proving their right to an [[inheritance]]. In some [[estate (land)|estate]]s there may be no known heirs, or there may be [[missing heir]]s whose names are known but their contact information is not. There may be also be known heirs from one part of the family, but another part of the family may be unknown. In all these instances, professional probate researchers work to trace the [[next-of-kin]].

Probate researchers are also called heir hunters, heir searchers, and forensic genealogists.

[[Intestacy|Intestacy laws]] vary enormously from one country to another, and in the US, they also vary from state to state. Thus probate researchers must have extensive knowledge of the law to know which family members are legally entitled to inherit. They also employ specialized genealogical and investigative techniques to search public records and databases to identify the extended family of the deceased, often starting with no more than a name and date of death and in some cases looking for relatives as distant as second cousins. In many cases the heirs that are finally identified have little or no knowledge of the person from whom they are inheriting.

Probate researchers are hired by [[solicitors]] in the United Kingdom, or [[Estate Attorneys]] in the United States. It is also common for them to independently review many cases to find a single case with missing or unknown heirs.

==Popular culture==
The [[BBC]] has made nine series (180 programs) of [[Heir Hunters]], shown on UK BBC TV about a number of UK companies. Episodes have also been screened in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

==The future of probate research==
As the population lives longer due to improved health, and is more mobile the problem of tracing missing heirs potentially becomes more difficult despite the growth of more web based research tools.

Many people are still reluctant to draft a proper will, or make bad ones which later prove invalid, or can easily be contested. As a consequence millions pass to the state, after a qualify period in trust waiting for claims from entitled beneficiaries, or being found by probate researchers or Heir Hunters.

The '''2006 - 2012 Professional Regulatory Board of Architecture''' ('''PRBoA'''), which started with its first member on 3 November 2006, was fully reconstituted as of 30 March 2007 in full compliance with ''Republic Act'' No. 9266 (''The Architecture Act'' of 2004). It served over the period 16 November 2006 through 23 November 2012 i.e. one (1) year and seven (7) calendar days (which ended with the appointment and swearing in of the new PRBoA Chairman, who heads the 2nd reconstituted PRBoA).

The PRBoA is one of 46 Professional Regulatory Boards (PRBs) under the [[Professional Regulation Commission]] (PRC) of the Republic of the [[Philippines]] and served as the primary spokes-entity for the nine (9) Professional Regulatory Boards ("PRBs") making up the Philippine (PH) Technology Professions i.e. the built and natural environment professions of agriculture, architecture, chemistry, environmental planning, forestry, interior design, landscape architecture and master plumbing. The State-regulated professions of architecture, environmental planning, interior design, landscape architecture and master plumbing are also collectively considered as the environmental design professions.

The PRBoA as an entity is under the administrative control and supervision of the PRC, a [[quasi-judicial]] and quasi-legislative entity that forms part of the [[executive branch]] of the Philippine Government. As such, it does not act independently on matters involving the regulation of the practice of the profession of [[architecture]] in the Philippines. The reconstituted PRBoA is a [[collegial]] body and is active in the areas of [[executive action]] relating to the implementation and enforcement of ''Republic Act'' No. 9266 (otherwise known as the Philippine "''Architecture Act'' of 2004"), its implementing rules and regulations (IRR) and derivative regulations e.g. other executive issuances of the PRBoA through the PRC.

The 16 November 2006 to 23 November 2012 reconstituted PRBoA was composed of three (2) privately practicing architects (working only on a part-time engagement as PRBoA members):

* Acting Chairman - Armando N. Alli, who served from 15 November 2006 through 23 November 2012 (6 years and 1 week);
* Senior Member - Angeline T. Chua Chiaco, who served from 3 November 2006 through 25 March 2013 (6 years and 4 months);
* Junior Member - Marietta B. Segovia, who served from 30 March 2007 through 27 March 2013 (almost 6 years).
From 2009 through 2012/ 2013, all three (3) 2006-2012 PRBoA Members served in a holdover capacity, until their respective replacements were appointed by the President of the Republic of the Philippines (PH).

As of 23 November 2012, the 2006-2012 reconstituted PRBoA regulated the practice of about 30,000 PH-registered architects (RAs) nationwide/ overseas i.e. natural (not juridical) persons. Of this number of RAs, it is conservatively estimated that less than half (approx. 14,000) have valid licenses to practice i.e. a Registered and Licensed Architect (RLA) and that up to 50.0% of said RLAs may already working outside the country. The PRBoA also regulates the practice of foreign architects (FA) i.e. only as natural (not as juridical) persons, wishing to engage in the professional practice of architecture for any building project on Philippine soil for a limited period of time and of architectural firms (sole/single proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, associations and [[joint venture]]s). Only individual foreign architects/ FAs (not foreign architectural firms/ FAFs) are allowed to practice architecture in the Philippines together with counterpart Filipino RLAs and only if they are issued a special/ temporary permit (STP) in accordance with R.A. No. 9266. The PRBoA supports the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Architects Register and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations/ [[ASEAN]] [[Mutual Recognition Arrangement]] (MRA) and its ASEAN Architects' Council (AAC) for borderless architectural practice/s, as qualified under the protocols/agreements and as qualified by valid and subsisting laws on architectural practice in the Philippines.

The PRBoA also administers the Licensure Examination for Architects (LEA) given twice in Manila annually by the [[Politics of the Philippines|Philippine Government]] and of Foreign LEAs (FLEAs) given as part of the now annual PRC Special Professional Licensure Board Examinations (SPLBEs) in such countries as [[Saudi Arabia]] (KSA), Qatar, Dubai and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for expatriate Filipinos (overseas Filipino workers or "OFWs"). Over the past six (6) years, the LEA [[mortality rate]] ranged from 49.0% to 68% per examination. Over the past 57 years of the regulation of Philippine architectural practice, only an average of about 400 annually are granted certificates and licenses to practice. With the elimination of manual drafting in the LEA subject of Architectural Design and Site Planning (ADSP) starting in late 2009 and with other LEA/ FLEA-related reforms, the LEA/ FLEA passing rates have more or less stabilized at 50 - 52%.

Among the executive concerns being presently addressed/ already addressed by the 2006 - 2012 reconstituted PRBoA are: 1) general information dissemination concerning the laws/ regulations on architectural practice, 2) enforcement mechanisms against illegal practitioners (non-RAs and non-RLAs) and 3) the completion of the amendments to the 1979 Standards of Professional Practice/SPP (otherwise known as the Architect's National Code/ ANC) in 2010. Among the quasi-judicial responsibilities being discharged by the PRBoA include the hearing of and the promulgation of decisions on administrative cases filed against RAs or RLAs and the review of cases against illegal practitioners for endorsement to prosecutors and  Philippine courts.

The practice of architecture in the Philippines is only a professional privilege that is granted to individuals and firms (natural and juridical persons), duly registered and licensed in accordance with Philippine law i.e. limited only to RLAs and registered architectural firms (RAFs). It was never a right accorded to RAs nor to any other State-regulated and licensed professional (RLP), specifically certain PH civil engineers (CEs) and their organizations who/ which insist that they too can exercise the same professional privileges as RLAs. In the case of RLAs, such an exclusive professional privilege can be suspended or revoked by the PRBoA for cause/s provided under law and only in accordance with due process.

The preparation, signing and sealing of architectural plans and documents are only for RLAs and not for any other RLP or other unqualified entities under PH law (specifically PH civil engineers and other unregistered persons as defined by law, specifically by R.A. No. 9266). As such, the 2006 - 2012 reconstituted PRBoA has actively campaigned since early 2007 for the full implementation and enforcement of the pertinent provisions under R.A. No. 9266, which all limit the preparation, signing and sealing of architectural plans and documents only to RLAs and which mandate all officials of the PH national and local governments to fully implement and enforce the said provisions. This means that even RAs who have not updated their licenses to practice architecture are prohibited from practicing until such time that they are able to renew such licenses (in the form of renewable identification/ ID cards).

Among the legal steps taken by the PRBoA to fully implement and enforce R.A. No. 9266 include the filing of graft charges against national and local government officials who refuse to implement and enforce R.A. No. 9266 and the harmonized provisions of the 2004 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of P.D. No. 1096 (the 1977 National Building Code of the Philippines/ NBCP). Also impleaded in the said suits are private individuals who willfully resist or violate the said laws.

Among the legislative initiatives of the 2006 - 2012 reconstituted PRBoA are participation in collaborative efforts to repeal the 1977 National [[Building code|Building Code]] of the Philippines (NBCP or Presidential Decree No. 1096), the amendment of anti-graft laws, the review of bills that tend to undermine professional architectural practice, the professionalization of the Local Government Unit (LGU) position of Building Official (BO) and Assistant Building Official (ABO), bills on non-mobile billboards, consulting service regulation and various other related concerns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="976">The '''Public Libraries (Ireland) Act 1902''' (2 Edw. 7 c. 20) was an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], given the royal assent on 8 August 1902, and repealed in 1981.

It amended the [[Public Libraries Act (Ireland) 1855]] to allow it to be adopted by Irish rural districts as well as urban districts, allowing them to establish public libraries.

The Act was repealed by the [[statutory instrument]] SI 1981/438.

'''''R (Tigere) v Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills''''' was a [[2015 Judgments of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|2015 judgment]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] concerning [[student loans in the United Kingdom]].

==Facts==
Beaurish Tigere arrived in the UK from Zambia at the age of six. She came as a dependent of her father who had a student visa. The father left in 2003 but Tigere remained with her mother who over-stayed. The [[UK Border Agency]] became aware of this situation in 2010 and granted them temporary permission to remain which became discretionary leave to remain in 2012. Tigere will be entitled to apply for [[indefinite leave to remain]] in 2018 but until that time she was unable to apply for a student loan despite achieving three [[A-Levels]] and a place at [[Northumbria University]] to study International Business Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3179037/Zambian-student-came-UK-six-won-high-court-battle-granted-student-loan.html |title=Zambian student who came to the UK when she was six has won high court battle to be granted a student loan |last1=Tonkin |first1=Sam |last2= |first2= |date=29 July 2015 |website= |publisher=[[Mail Online]] |access-date=19 August 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was brought on behalf of Tigere by Public Interest Lawyers who argued that the policy was an infringement of Tigere's [[right to education]] under Article 2 of the First Protocol of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. This provision reads "[n]o person shall be denied the right to education" and the negative formulation does mean that there is no automatic entitlement to public support.&lt;ref&gt;''Belgian Linguistics Case (No 2)'' (1968) 1 EHRR 252, at para B3&lt;/ref&gt; However Tigere argued that this ought to be read in line with Article 14 of the Convention that states her rights "shall be secured without discrimination on any ground" (in this case her immigration status).&lt;ref&gt;''Bah v United Kingdom'' (2011) 54 EHRR 773, paras 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==

===High Court===
The High Court found in favour of Tigere and held that the blanket ban on her eligibility for a student loan based on her immigration status was a disproportionate interference on her right to education and also constituted discrimination under Article 14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2014/2452.html [2014&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EWHC 2452 (Admin)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court of Appeal===
The [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Secretary of State]] appealed the decision to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] which held that the case concerned an area of "national strategic policy for the distribution of scarce resources in a field of great social importance" and therefore a wide [[margin of appreciation]] should be afforded to government policy. With this in mind the appeal was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanrights.eu/public/sentenze/EWCA31lug.pdf [2014&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EWCA Civ 1216]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court===
The Supreme Court allowed Ms. Tigere's appeal by a majority of three to two. [[Lady Hale]] (with whom [[Lord Kerr]] agreed) gave the leading judgment and concluded:
{{Cquote|41. Any short-term savings to the public purse by denying these students finance, by way of loans, not grants, are just that, as most of them will eventually qualify for loans, and in the meantime the benefit their enhanced qualifications will bring to the exchequer and the economy have been lost.}}
[[Anthony Hughes, Lord Hughes of Ombersley|Lord Hughes]] offered a concurring judgment but slightly disagreed with Lady Hale by suggesting that any future rules drawn up by the Secretary of State would not necessarily have to include an 'exceptional case' discretion. In particular he noted:
{{Cquote|68.  Since it is for the Secretary of State to devise a rule which does not thus infringe, it is of course open to him to adopt one which incorporates an elastic “exceptional case” discretion. But for my part I am
wholly satisfied that if he should elect not to include such a discretion, that decision could not result in any infringement of Convention rights.}}
[[File:University of Northumbria (geograph 2056156).jpg|thumb|alt=University of Northumbria |Ms. Tigere's four A-Levels earned her a place at [[Northumbria University]].]]
The joint minority judgment handed down by Lords [[Robert Reed, Lord Reed|Reed]] and [[Jonathan Sumption|Sumption]] argued that the appropriate test is whether the scheme is 'manifestly without foundation' and concluded that:
{{Cquote|100. In a case where a range of rational and proportionate policy options is open to the decision-maker, the decision which provides the best allocation of scarce resources is a question of social and economic evaluation. These are matters of political and administrative judgment, which the law leaves to those who are answerable to Parliament. They are not questions for a court of law. It is enough to justify the Secretary of State’s choice in this case that discrimination on the basis of residence and settlement are not “manifestly without foundation”.}}

==Impact==
Solicitor Paul Heron, of Public Interest Lawyers, said: 

“My client is a talented and brave individual and is a credit to the comprehensive school system in Britain.

She has worked hard to obtain excellent grades. Yet she had been denied her opportunity to go to university for the past two years. She has faced this government down.

The regulations which were introduced by the last Tory/Liberal government made absolutely no economic sense and appear to have been dreamed up in a Daily Mail think tank.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Student loan access opened to migrants|url = http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-56e3-Student-loan-access-opened-to-migrants#.VofdQxHtqLs|website = www.morningstaronline.co.uk|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coram Children’s Legal Centre provided evidence for the hearing. Their solicitor, Alison East, said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/29/immigration-student-loan-supreme-court-beaurish-tigere |title=School-leaver overturns immigration-related blanket ban on student loan |last1=Bowcott |first1=Owen |last2= |first2= |date=29 July 2015 |website= |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=19 August 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Cquote|“These young people have worked hard to do well at school and at college, and aspire to achieve the best they can. Seeing their friends and peers go to university when they cannot and being aware of being held back for as long as 10 years in pursuing qualifications that are essential in a competitive job market inevitably causes these young people to feel marginalised, which is why we are thrilled with the supreme court ruling in this instance.”}}
The [[Daily Express]] noted that the judgment came "as figures revealed that students from the European Union have dodged paying back £43million in taxpayer-funded loans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/594856/student-loan-Beaurish-Tigere-leave-to-remain-immigration-human-rights-Supreme-Court-appeal |title=Zambian who lived in UK illegally WINS court battle for student loan |last1=Campbell |first1=Scott |last2= |first2= |date=30 July 2015 |website= |publisher=[[The Daily Express]] |access-date=19 August 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just for Kids Law intervened in the case and estimated that between 600-1,000 students were affected by the restrictions each year. Their director Shauneen Lambe responded to the judgment by saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/11772772/University-student-loans-case-British-educated-teens-win-ruling.html |last1=Sanghani |first1=Radhika |last2= |first2= |date=30 July 2015 |website= |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=19 August 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Cquote|This ruling is wonderful news for many ambitious and academically successful young people, who would otherwise be blocked from ever entering professions which require a degree.
We look forward to working with government to make sure their ability to get a loan is restored in time for this year’s A-level results day on 13 August, so that students who have achieved their grades have the chance to take up their university places in the autumn.}}

The '''Red Shirts''' or '''Redshirts''' of the [[Southern United States]] were [[White supremacy|white supremacist]]&lt;ref name="A field guide to the racists commemorated inside the U.S. Capitol"&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeBonis|first1=Mike|title=A field guide to the racists commemorated inside the U.S. Capitol|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/06/23/a-field-guide-to-the-racists-commemorated-inside-the-u-s-capitol/|accessdate=24 September 2016|work=Washington Post|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="White Supremacy and Terrorism"&gt;{{cite web|title=White Supremacy and Terrorism|url=https://www.pbs.org/tpt/slavery-by-another-name/themes/white-supremacy/|publisher=PBS|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[paramilitary]] groups that were active in the late 19th century in the last years and after the end of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States]]. Red Shirt groups originated in [[Mississippi]] in 1875, when [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] private terror units adopted red shirts to make themselves more visible and threatening to Southern [[Republican party (United States)|Republicans]], both whites and [[freedmen]]. Similar groups in the Carolinas also adopted red shirts.

Among the most prominent Red Shirts were the supporters of Democratic Party candidate [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] during the campaigns for the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1876|South Carolina gubernatorial elections of 1876]] and [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1878|1878]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lane, ''The Day Freedom Died,'' (2008) p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Shirts were one of several [[paramilitary organizations]], such as the [[White League]] in [[Louisiana]], arising from the continuing efforts of white Democrats to regain political power in the South in the 1870s. These groups acted as "the military arm of the Democratic Party."&lt;ref&gt;George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

While sometimes engaging in violent acts of terrorism, the Red Shirts, the [[White League]], rifle clubs, and similar groups in the late nineteenth century worked openly and were better organized than the secret [[vigilante]] groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. They used organization, intimidation and force to achieve political purposes of restoring the Democrats to power, overturning Republicans, and repressing civil and voting rights of freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Lemann]], ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, Paperback, 2007, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1876, 1898 and 1900 campaigns in [[North Carolina]], the Red Shirts played prominent roles in intimidating non-Democratic Party voters.

==Origins and symbolism==

According to [[E. Merton Coulter]] in ''The South During Reconstruction'' (1947), the red shirt was adopted in Mississippi in 1875 by "southern brigadiers" of the Democratic Party who were opposed to black Republicans. The Red Shirts disrupted Republican rallies, intimidated or assassinated black leaders, and discouraged and suppressed black voting at the polls.

Men wearing red shirts appeared in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] on August 25, 1876, during a Democratic torchlight parade. It was to mock the ''[[waving the bloody shirt]]'' speech by [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Franklin Butler]] of Massachusetts, in which he was falsely claimed to have held up a shirt stained with the blood of a [[carpetbagger]] whipped by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] during the [[Reconstruction Era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Stephen | last1 = Budiansky | title =  The Bloody Shirt: Terror After Appomattox | pages = 1–5 |location=New York | publisher = Viking | year = 2008 | authorlink = Stephen Budiansky |isbn=0-670-01840-6 |oclc=173350931 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oMjFEGhF8JMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Waving the bloody shirt" became an idiom in the South, attributed to rhetoric by Republican politicians such as [[Oliver Hazard Perry Morton]] in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], who used emotional accounts of injustices done to Northern soldiers and [[carpetbaggers]] to bolster support for the Republicans' Reconstruction policies in South Carolina. The red shirt symbolism quickly spread. Suspects accused in the [[Hamburg Massacre]] wore red shirts as they marched on September 5 to their [[arraignment]] in [[Aiken, South Carolina]]. [[Martin Witherspoon Gary|Martin Gary]], the organizer in South Carolina of the Democratic campaign in 1876, mandated that his supporters were to wear red shirts at all party rallies and functions.

Wearing a red shirt became a source of pride and resistance to Republican rule for white Democrats in South Carolina. Women sewed red [[flannel|flannel shirts]] and made other garments of red. It also became [[fashion]]able for women to wear red ribbons in their hair or about their waists. Young men adopted the red shirts to express militancy after being too young to have fought in the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, William Watts (1932). ''The State That Forgot: South Carolina's Surrender to Democracy'', Indianapolis, IN: The Bobbs-Merril Company. pp. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Carolina Red Shirts==
[[South Carolina Democratic Party|State Democrats]] organized parades and rallies in every [[list of counties in South Carolina|county of South Carolina]]. Many of the participants were armed and mounted; all wore red. Mounted men gave an impression of greater power and numbers. When [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] and other Democrats spoke, the Red Shirts would respond enthusiastically, shouting the campaign slogan, "Hurrah for Hampton." This created a massive spectacle that united and motivated his followers.

Red Shirts sought to intimidate both white and black watchers into voting for the Democrats or not at all. The Red Shirts and similar groups were especially active in those states with an African-American majority. They broke up Republican meetings, disrupted their organizing, and intimidated black voters at the polls. Many [[freedmen]] stopped voting from fear, and others voted for Democrats under pressure. The Red Shirts did not hesitate to use violence, nor did the other private militia groups. In the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] counties of [[Aiken County, South Carolina|Aiken]], [[Edgefield County, South Carolina|Edgefield]], and [[Barnwell County, South Carolina|Barnwell]], freedmen who voted were driven from their homes and whipped, while some of their leaders were murdered. During the 1876 presidential election, Democrats in Edgefield and [[Laurens County, South Carolina|Laurens]] counties voted "early and often", while freedmen were barred from the polls.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Foner]], ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877'', New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1988; Perennial Classics, 2002, p. 574-575&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed and mounted Red Shirts accompanied Hampton on his tour of the state. They attended Republican meetings and would demand equal time, but they usually only stood in silence. At times, Red Shirts would hold a [[barbecue]] nearby to lure Republicans and try to convince them to vote for the Democratic ticket.

Hampton positioned himself as a statesman, promising support for education and offering protection from violence that Governor [[Daniel Henry Chamberlain]] did not seem able to provide. Few freedmen voted for Hampton, and most remained loyal to the Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln. The 1876 campaign was the "most tumultuous in South Carolina's history."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877'', New York: Perennial Classics, 2002, p. 572-573&lt;/ref&gt; "An anti-Reconstruction historian later estimated that 150 Negroes were murdered in South Carolina during the campaign."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux, Paperback, 2007, p.174&lt;/ref&gt;

After the election on November 7, a protracted dispute between Chamberlain and Hampton ensued as both claimed victory. Because of the massive election fraud, [[Edmund William McGregor Mackey]], a Republican member of the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]], called upon the "Hunkidori Club" from Charleston to eject Democratic members from [[Edgefield County, South Carolina|Edgefield]] and [[Laurens County, South Carolina|Laurens]] counties from the House. Word spread through the state. By December 3, approximately 5,000 Red Shirts assembled at the [[South Carolina State House|State House]] to defend the Democrats. Hampton appealed for calm and the Red Shirts dispersed.

As a result of a national political compromise, President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] ordered the removal of the [[Union Army]] from the state on April 3, 1877. The white Democrats completed their political takeover of South Carolina. In the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1878|gubernatorial election of 1878]], the Red Shirts made a nominal appearance as Hampton was re-elected without opposition.

Future South Carolina Democratic politicians, such as [[Benjamin Tillman]] and [[Ellison D. Smith]], proudly claimed their association in their youth with the Red Shirts as a ''[[bona fide]]'' for [[white supremacy]].

==North Carolina Red Shirts==
[[File:Redshirt.jpg|thumb|"Red Shirt" displayed, at the [[North Carolina Museum of History]], from the 1898 [[North Carolina]] [[gubernatorial election]]]]
Red Shirts were active again around the 1896 and 1898 elections, allied with the Democrats' appeals to voters to support white supremacy, in an effort to avoid voters moving to the Populist fusion candidate, as some had done  in the 1896 gubernatorial election.

The Red Shirts were part of a Democratic campaign to oppose the interracial coalition of Republicans and [[Populist Party (United States)|Populists]], which had gained control of the state legislature in the 1894 election and elected a Republican governor in 1896. Such biracial coalitions had also occurred in other states across the South, in some cases overturning or threatening white Democratic control of state legislatures. Upper-class and middle-class white populations feared the empowerment of [[freedmen]] and poor whites. To break up the coalition, white Democrats used intimidation and outright violence to reduce black Republican voting and regained control of the state legislature in 1896.

Intimidation and violence against blacks increased prior to the 1898 election throughout the state, especially in black-majority counties. On November 4, 1898, the ''[[Raleigh News &amp; Observer]]'' noted,
&lt;blockquote&gt; The first Red Shirt parade on horseback ever witnessed in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] electrified the people today. It created enthusiasm among the whites and consternation among the Negroes. The whole town turned out to see it. It was an enthusiastic body of men. Otherwise it was quiet and orderly.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;At the time, Wilmington was the largest city in the state and majority-black in population.

In Wilmington, a biracial coalition of Republicans won the offices of mayor and aldermen in 1898. The mayor and two-thirds of the aldermen were white, elected from a black-majority city. But local white Democrats wanted power and took it six days after the election in the [[Wilmington Insurrection of 1898]], the largest recognized ''[[coup d'état]]'' in United States history. After overthrowing the government, the mob attacked black areas of the city and killed numerous blacks, burning down houses, schools and churches. So many blacks left Wilmington permanently that the demographics changed, resulting in a white-majority city.

White Democrats controlling the state legislature drafted an amendment to the state constitution that [[disfranchisement after the Civil War|disfranchised]] most African Americans and many poor whites by establishing requirements for [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] and [[literacy tests]], which raised barriers to voter registration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon", ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol.17, 2000, p. 27], accessed 10 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, the amendment was adopted by a statewide popular referendum in which black-voter turnout was suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perman|first1=Michael|title=Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888-1908|date=2001|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=080784909X|pages=148–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1896 to 1904, black voter turnout in North Carolina was reduced to near zero by the combination of such voter registration provisions together with more complicated rules for voting. This followed a pattern of similar state actions across the South, starting with the state of [[Mississippi]]'s new constitution in 1890. After a generation of [[white supremacy]], many people forgot that North Carolina once had thriving middle-class blacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon", ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol.17, 2000, pp.12-13], accessed 10 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the group===
Due to the feelings of political devaluation among many white Democrats in North Carolina, the Democratic party and Red Shirts made it their goal to restore full and total power. The Red Shirts intimidated black voters by threat and outright attack, and practically eliminated the black vote in the state.&lt;ref name="Prather 1977"&gt;Prather 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Red Shirts were first spotted in North Carolina during the October 21, 1898, rally in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]]. At this rally  [[Benjamin Tillman]], a prominent South Carolina Red Shirts leader, gave a speech that was followed by a plethora of Red Shirt activities in the state of North Carolina.&lt;ref name="Prather 1977"/&gt; The North Carolina Red Shirts were a conglomerate of all social classes, including teachers, farmers, merchants and some elite members of the Democratic Party.&lt;ref name="Edmonds 1951"&gt;Edmonds 1951&lt;/ref&gt; From that day on, Red Shirts chapters were particularly active in the southeastern part of North Carolina, including "New Hanover, Brunswick, Columbus, and Robeson counties," all of which geographically lie next to the South Carolina border and had large black populations.&lt;ref name="Edmonds 1951"/&gt;

Their early activities were part of initiating the [[white supremacy]] movements of 1898 and 1900. These arose in reaction to the increase in election of numerous local and state black government officials in the State of North Carolina between the years of 1894 and 1897. This increase in the number of black officials forced the "frightened and desperate Democratic Party" to initiate the white supremacy campaign in which the Red Shirts would become integral partners.&lt;ref name="Beeby 2008"&gt;Beeby 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Ku Klux Klan]], the Red Shirts collaborated only with the Democratic Party. They operated openly, as they wanted the North Carolina population and non-Democrats to know the identities of their members. By the end of the election in 1898, they proved to be a potent political force.&lt;ref name="Prather 1977"/&gt;

====Election of 1898====
During the initial reign of Red Shirts terror, the senator of North Carolina, Sen. [[Jeter Pritchard]] (R), wrote to Pres. McKinley asking, "Will you send deputy United States Marshal to preserve the peace?"&lt;ref name="Prather 1977"/&gt; The Red Shirts used the tactics of intimidation and sometimes violence to suppress voting by non-Democrats. With the rise in intimidation by the Red Shirts, both blacks and threatened whites were buying weaponry to protect themselves. Pritchard noted in his letter that the Red Shirts were most active "in counties where colored people predominate," and the paramilitary group targeted blacks.&lt;ref name="Prather 1977"/&gt;

Gov. [[Daniel L. Russell]] (R) said that along the southern edge of the state, "armed and lawless" men had taken over due to the increase in crimes and violent activities. The Red Shirts often disrupted many non-Democratic political meeting via "threats, intimidation, and actual violence".&lt;ref name="Prather 1977"/&gt; Through their intimidation, the Red Shirts successfully deterred many members of the counties from registering to vote in the 1898 state election. Due to the citizens being fearful to register, Gov. Russell issued a proclamation on October 26, 1898, asking all "Ill-disposed persons&amp;nbsp;... to immediately desist from all unlawful practices&amp;nbsp;... Turbulent conduct, and to preserve peace." Governor Russell's proclamation did not sit well with the Red Shirts; they increased their activity.&lt;ref name="Prather 1977"/&gt;

===== Before the election=====
The week before the 1898 election, the Red Shirts' activities were non-stop, and the threats were so recurrent that many Republicans and [[Fusionist]] speakers canceled their engagements; the entire Republican Fusion ticket withdrew in New Hanover County.&lt;ref name="Prather 1977"/&gt; A few days before the election on November 2, 1898, the ''Morning Star'' newspaper of Wilmington reported a large rally with the Red Shirt affiliate [[Claude Kitchin]] as the fiery speaker. The rally involved 1,000 men with red shirts who marched for 10 miles in the predominantly black areas of [[Richmond County, North Carolina]]. Their goal was "to show their determination to rid themselves of Negro rule." The paper reported that "many Negroes [had] taken their names from the registration list."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/1898/sources/rsrally.html "White Men Show Their Determination to Rid themselves of Negro Rule: A Thousand Red Shirts"], ''Morning Star'', 2 November 1898, Special Star Telegram.: p.1. Accessed November 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Election day=====
During the November 8, 1898, election, Red Shirts enforced their previous activities by riding around the voting precincts on their horses, with rifles and shotguns ready, to deter all Republicans, Fusionists and African Americans from the polls. The Red Shirts' activity helped the Democrats win with a 25,000 majority, as headlined in the ''News and Observer.''&lt;ref name="Prather 1977"/&gt; A large celebration on November 15 was organized by [[Josephus Daniels]] to commemorate "[[white supremacy]] and rescuing the state from Negro-rule."

====Election of 1900====

=====Before the election=====
The election of 1900 was a special election because there was one held in August and another held in November. The white supremacy theme was repeated, with sayings such as "White Rule for TarHeels," "White Supremacy", and "No Negro Rule".&lt;ref name="Prather 1977"/&gt; The Red Shirts and Democrats would ensure their win during the August special election, which was a Democratic ploy to disfranchise the black vote. The Democrat and Red Shirts felt that if they could "demoralize black leaders," the black vote would decrease.&lt;ref name="Beeby 2008"/&gt; On the day of the disfranchisement election in August, one prominent black leader, Abe Middleton, a former Republican county chairman of Duplin County, was symbolically "killed" when his wife found a "pasteboard coffin" in their garden. During a post-election hearing, Middleton testified that there was an increase in shooting near his home.&lt;ref name="Beeby 2008"/&gt; Though the incidents did not faze Middleton, members of the black community saw this activity and refrained from voting. The intimidation activities of the Red Shirts were so successful that many African Americans abandoned their homes, some seeking refugee in swamps, as recounted by Dave Kennedy, a black voter of [[Duplin County]].&lt;ref name="Beeby 2008"/&gt;

The Red Shirts also continued to attack white Republicans and other opponents to the Democrats. ''The New York Times'', in an August 2, 1900, article, noted that the day before the election, the Red Shirts disrupted the speech of Mr. Teague and demolished the platform on which he spoke.&lt;ref name="riots"&gt;"Riots in North Carolina: Red Shirts Drive Off Populist Speakers and Destroy Stand." ''[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/08/02/102424924.pdf The New York Times]'', 2 August 1900. Accessed November 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Shirts were indirectly supported by many law enforcement officials, who failed to take action against them in most counties throughout the state.&lt;ref name="Beeby 2008"/&gt; Later, as Teague was traveling to Dunn County, during his canvassing tour of the state, he was kidnapped by the Red Shirts and driven out of town.&lt;ref name="riots" /&gt; Among other prominent non-Democratic speakers, Marion Butler and others were disrupted by the throwing of rotten eggs. Due to the increasingly disruptive activities of the Red Shirts, the Republican Party chairman of Johnson County sent a request for troops to Gov. Russell.&lt;ref name="Prather 1977"/&gt;

===== Election day=====
On the day of the 1900 election, the Red Shirts were even more obvious than in 1898. They rode around the voting polls with their guns and horses, intimidating blacks and other Republicans. The success of the disfranchisement of black votes in the August 1900 election, ultimately resulted in the November Democratic gubernatorial win of [[Charles Brantley Aycock]] over Adams, the Republican. The vote of 186,650 to 126,296 was noted as "the largest majority ever given to a [[gubernatorial]] candidate".&lt;ref name="Prather 1977"/&gt;

After the Democratic win in November, the Red Shirts disappeared from public view. Because their members were primarily poor whites, the Democratic Party of elitist whites parted ways with the group. Thus the prevalence of Red Shirts declined upon the inauguration of Gov. Aycock.&lt;ref name="Prather 1977"/&gt;

==Contemporary South Carolina Red Shirts==
The [[League of the South]] of South Carolina has a specialized membership category known as "Red Shirts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sclos.org/about.htm About The South Carolina League of the South]&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Shirts have organized demonstrations in support of the [[Confederate flag]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sclos.org/Newsletters/SC_Patriot_Autumn_2010.pdf "The Red Shirts Ride Again," ''The South Carolina Patriot,'' Vol. XII Issue IV Aug. 2010 p.4]&lt;/ref&gt; against the establishment of [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]], and against politicians they regard as "scalawags" and "carpetbaggers" such as [[Lindsey Graham]], [[Bob Inglis]] and [[John McCain]], and attorney [[Morris Dees]]. They supported the candidacy of [[John Cobin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sclos.org/Newsletters/SC_Patriot_Summer_2006.pdf "The Red Shirt Report"], ''The South Carolina Patriot,'' Vol. IX Issue 3 Summer 2006 p.22&lt;/ref&gt; and conducted [[mock trials]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sclos.org/Newsletters/SC_Patriot_Autumn_2006.pdf "The Red Shirt Report"], ''Calling All Red Shirts to the Burning of Columbia,'' Vol. IX Issue 4 Autumn 2006, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

According to their application for membership, Red Shirt goals include implementing "God's laws as the acceptable standard of behavior"; eliminating all federal "control and influence in South Carolina"; reducing the size and scope of government at all levels; and promoting and instituting "Southern culture relying on Biblical truth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sclos.org/brochures/RedShirtsApplication.pdf SOUTH CAROLINA RED SHIRTS]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2017}}
{{Use British English|date=August 2017}}

A '''royal commission''' is a major ad-hoc formal [[public inquiry]] into a defined issue in some [[monarchy|monarchies]]. They have been held in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Saudi Arabia]].  A royal commission is similar in function to a '''commission of enquiry''' (or '''inquiry''') found in other countries such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[South Africa]], and regions such as [[Hong Kong]]. It has considerable powers, generally greater even than those of a [[judge]] but restricted to the [[terms of reference]] of the commission. The commission is created by the head of state (the sovereign, or his/her representative in the form of a governor-general or governor) on the advice of the government and formally appointed by [[letters patent]]. In practice—unlike lesser forms of inquiry—once a commission has started the government cannot stop it. Consequently, governments are usually very careful about framing the terms of reference and generally include in them a date by which the commission must finish.

Royal commissions are called to look into matters of great importance and usually controversy.  These can be matters such as government structure, the treatment of minorities, events of considerable public concern or economic questions. Many royal commissions last many years and, often, a different government is left to respond to the findings. 

== Notable royal commissions ==
=== Australia ===
In Australia—and particularly [[New South Wales]]—royal commissions have been investigations into police and government [[political corruption|corruption]] and [[organised crime]] using the very broad coercive powers of the royal commissioner to defeat the protective systems that powerful, but corrupt, public officials had used to shield themselves from conventional investigation.

Royal commissions are usually chaired by one or more notable figures. Because of their [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] powers the commissioners are often [[retire]]d or serving judges. They usually involve research into an issue, consultations with experts both within and outside government and public consultations as well. The warrant may grant immense investigatory powers, including summoning witnesses under [[oath]], offering of indemnities, seizing of documents and other evidence (sometimes including those normally protected, such as [[classified information]]), holding hearings ''[[in camera]]'' if necessary and—in a few cases—compelling all government officials to aid in the execution of the Commission. The results of Royal Commissions are published in reports, often massive, of findings containing policy recommendations. (Due to the verbose nature of the titles of these formal documents – for example, the [[Royal commission into whether there has been corrupt or criminal conduct by any Western Australian Police Officer]] – they are commonly known by the name of the commission's chair.)  While these reports are often quite influential, with the government enacting some or all recommendations into law, the work of some commissions have been almost completely ignored by the government. In other cases, where the commissioner has departed from the Warranted terms, the commission has been dissolved by a superior court.

'''Slavery in international law''' is governed by a number of treaties, conventions and declarations. Foremost among these is the ''[[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]]'' (1948) that states in Article 4: “no one should be held in slavery or servitude, slavery in all of its forms should be eliminated.”&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. "Universal Declaration on Human Rights." General Assembly of the United Nations. 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law protections==
Protection from [[slavery]] is reiterated in the Slavery Convention.&lt;ref&gt;"Slavery Convention." Geneva: Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], September 25, 1926: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This is affected by the Optional Protocol to the Abolition of Slavery&lt;ref&gt;"Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices." Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], September 7, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR).&lt;ref name="gen covenant"&gt;General Assembly. "International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights." 2200A (XXI). Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; The ICCPR, governed by the Human Rights Committee,&lt;ref&gt;General Assembly. "International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights." 2200A (XXI) while the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for internationally monitoring present conditions of slavery.

== Historical abolition of slavery ==
Abolitionism has its roots in the 1807 [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Abolition of Slavery Act]] of [[Great Britain]]. Many academics in the field perceive this as the beginning of the end of the traditional form of slavery: chattel slavery. In the 19th century, Britain controlled the majority of the world through its colonies. Consequently, in passing this law to abolish slavery, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] abolished slavery in the vast majority of its colonies. 

Customarily, freedoms from slavery can also be found prior to the 19th century under the phrase "freedom from oppression and tyranny." Because slavery is a condition of complete and total submission of one person to another, often with the exertion of force or power of the owner over the submissive, the phrase "freedom from oppression and tyranny" accurately encompasses the right to freedom from slavery. 

The [[United States Declaration of Independence]],&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration of Independence." United States of America, July 4, 1776&lt;/ref&gt; the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]],&lt;ref&gt;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen." National Assembly of France, August 26, 1789&lt;/ref&gt; the African Charter of Human Rights,&lt;ref&gt;"African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights." African Union, June 27, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Constitution of South Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;"Constitution of South Africa." South Africa, May 6, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; all present the idea that human beings should be free from tyranny and oppression. Although slavery continued to persist in some countries after these documents were written – namely, the United States, in which slavery continued until the adoption of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] in 1865  – the underlying norm of this right is present. Through customary practice and the abolition of slavery, the international community has adopted the right of each person to be free from slavery.

== Slavery Convention ==

The first large-scale move to abolish slavery by the international community came in 1926 with the [[1926 Slavery Convention|Slavery Convention]] and again in 1957 when the [[United Nations 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery|Supplementary Convention]] came into power. The 1926 Slavery Convention provides the first international definition of slavery as:

::"the status or condition of a person over whom any or all the powers attaching to the right ownership are exercised...[and] included all acts involved in the capture, acquisition, or disposal of a person with intent to reduce him to slavery; acts involved in the acquisition of a slave with a view to selling or exchanging him; all acts of disposal by sale or exchange of a slave acquired with a view to being sold or exchanged, and in general, every act of trade or transport in slaves."&lt;ref&gt;"Slavery Convention." Geneva: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, September 25, 1926: 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this document provides the concrete definition of slavery, its definition is limited in the types of slavery it includes. Instead, it is descriptive of chattel slavery, most commonly understood as the [[Plantation economy|plantation slavery]] in the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, even though chattel slavery was significantly more widespread and was not limited to one country alone. It is for this reason that the 1956 Supplementary Convention on Slavery was signed. It gives a more comprehensive definition of slavery to include debt bondage, serfdom, or any practice where a woman is promised or given into marriage on payment of money and is without the right to refuse the marriage, the husband of a woman has the right to transfer her to another person, a woman is liable to be inherited by another upon the death of her husband, or any practice where a child under 18 years of ages is exploited for his or her labour.&lt;ref&gt;"Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices." Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, September 7, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1956 Supplementary Convention on Slavery came into force on April 30, 1957 and of 2002 there were 97 states partied to the convention.

The Slavery Convention and its supplementary document are beneficial in providing an international definition of slavery; however, there is no significant enforcement behind these documents. Both are declarations made by the collaboration of the international community, and agreements that signatories would modify their national laws in accordance with the convention, with the assistance of the United Nations if necessary; however, there are no consequences outlined in either document  that provide incentive for signatories to abide by the convention

== Human Rights Committee ==

The Human Rights Committee is governed by the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), which entered into force on March 23, 1976. Article 8 of this Covenant states: “No one shall be held in slavery; slavery and the slave trade in all their forms shall be prohibited. No one shall be held in servitude. No one shall be required to perform force or compulsory labour."&lt;ref name="gen covenant"/&gt; The ICCPR outlines, in part IV, the obligations of states to uphold the freedom from slavery. All states are required to submit regular reports to the Committee on how the rights of the Covenant are being implemented. A state’s initial report must be within one year of acceding the Covenant and after this, whenever the committee requests a report (usually every four years).&lt;ref name="gen covenant"/&gt; In addition to the submission of reports, article 41 of the Covenant makes it possible for the Committee to consider inter-state complaints, and furthermore, the First Optional Protocol to the Covenant give the Committee the capacity investigate individual complaints with regards to violations of the Covenant by state parties.&lt;ref&gt;"Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights." New York: United Nations, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Observations of slavery ===

==== Mali ====
{{Main|Slavery in Mali}}

Since coming into force, the Human Rights Committee has commented on conditions of slavery in numerous countries and has provided these countries with recommendations as to how they should proceed to abolish slavery. In [[Mali]], the committee noted that the State party has not taken clear action in response the reports of slavery like practices and hereditary servitude in the country. In acknowledging this, the committee recommended that the state should conduct research to determine if these conditions of slavery still exist, and if they do to take action.&lt;ref name="conclude 16"&gt;"Concluding observations of the Human Rights Committee: Mali. 04/16/2003." CCPR/CO/77/MLI. Human Rights Committee, 2003: 16&lt;/ref&gt;  The committee also noted concerns of child trafficking into Côte d'Ivoire, where children were then being subjected to forced labour and slavery. In response to this phenomenon, the committee recommended that the Malian government take measures to prosecute the perpetrators of this traffic, and research more precise details regarding this situation for the committee analysis.&lt;ref name="conclude 16"/&gt;

==== Serbia ====
The committee observed situations of trafficking of human beings, namely women and children, in [[Serbia and Montenegro|Serbia]], and corresponding reports that the perpetrators of these acts were going unpunished. The committee recommended that the Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in collaboration with the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) should ensure that there is adequate investigation of these crimes and victims have access to lawyers, health care, and other forms of assistance.&lt;ref&gt;"Consideration of Reports Submitted by States Parties Under Article 40 of the Covenant, Concluding Observations of the Human Rights Committee: Kosovo (Serbia)." CCPR/C/UNK/CO/1. Human Rights Committee, 2006: 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Norway ====
The Human Rights Committee monitored trafficking in [[Norway]]. Here the committee recognizes that Norway has adopted the previous positive measures previously suggested; however, it notes that there are still reports of human trafficking, particularly women, and of [[female genital mutilation]]. The committee recommends further measures be taken to eradicate practices, as well as those to protect victims and witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;"Consideration of Reports Submitted by States Parties Under article 40 of the Covenant, Concluding Observations of the Human Rights Committee: Norway." CCPR/C/NOR/CO/5. Human Rights Committee, 2006: 12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern slavery that falls under international law ==

=== Debt bondage ===

[[Debt bondage]] is the most common form of slavery today. It is a condition in which a person “pledges him or herself against a loan of money, but the length and nature of the service is undefined, and the labor does not diminish the original debt.”&lt;ref&gt;Bales, Kevin. "Expendable People: Slavery in the Age of Globalization." Journal of International Affairs 53, no. 2 (2000): 463.&lt;/ref&gt;  Debt bondage was included and defined as a form of slavery under the 1956 Supplementary Convention on Slavery. However, its many modern forms continue to include pawning, [[Peon|peonage]], and worker debt.&lt;ref name="miers 724"&gt;Miers, Suzanne. "Contemporary Forms of Slavery." Canadian Journal of African Studies 34, no. 3 (2000): 724.&lt;/ref&gt; In India, debt bondage has been illegal since 1976; however, due to widespread poverty in the country, it continues to exist, as a man may need a loan to finance a wedding, funeral, medicine, fertilizer, or a fine.&lt;ref name="miers 724"/&gt; Because the interest rates on these debts as so high, debts are often inherited and children may replace their fathers or siblings. Debt bondage can also be incurred by specific industries – quarrying, carpet-making, agriculture, and fisheries – where the cost of equipment and supplies falls on the worker who needs a loan to pay for them.&lt;ref name="miers 724"/&gt;

=== Forced prostitution ===
[[Forced prostitution]] and sexual slavery are considered contemporary manifestations of this historical crime, and can be found anywhere in the world. Women are often entrapped by deceit or coercion with the promise of better life and remain entrapped by force or debt bondage.&lt;ref&gt;Miers, Suzanne. "Contemporary Forms of Slavery." Canadian Journal of African Studies 34, no. 3 (2000): 729.&lt;/ref&gt; Forced marriage can also be considered a form of slavery, notably when the bride has no right or opportunity to refuse marriage. This form of marriage can also result out of a kidnapping of girls in order to sell them as brides, a widespread phenomena in China.&lt;ref name="miers 737"&gt;Miers, Suzanne. "Contemporary Forms of Slavery." Canadian Journal of African Studies 34, no. 3 (2000): 737.&lt;/ref&gt; Once married and raped, there girls are often kept under lock and key until they have a child, at which time they will be less likely to leave because they do not want to abandon their child.&lt;ref name="miers 737"/&gt;

=== Child slavery ===
[[Child slavery]] is also considered a contemporary form of slavery, although its does come with debate as to what constitutes child slavery. However, child prostitution is widely considered a form of slavery in which children, mostly from South East Asia, South Asia, and Latin America, “are sold by their parents either because they are destitute, have too many mouths to feed, or are simply greedy”.&lt;ref&gt;Miers, Suzanne. "Contemporary Forms of Slavery." Canadian Journal of African Studies 34, no. 3 (2000): 731.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in some cases of child prostitution, when parents give their children up to traffickers, they are deceived into believing that their child will earn good money, get an education, or learn a trade.&lt;ref&gt;Miers, Suzanne. "Contemporary Forms of Slavery." Canadian Journal of African Studies 34, no. 3 (2000): 732.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forced labour ===
{{See also|Human trafficking}}

Forced labour can also be imposed by governments who “conscript their own subjects and put them to work for minimal, or no pay, and for varying lengths of time”.&lt;ref&gt;Miers, Suzanne. "Contemporary Forms of Slavery". ''Canadian Journal of African Studies'' 34, no. 3 (2000): 733.&lt;/ref&gt; When imposed by governments, forced labour does not include military conscription or penal labour.{{Says who|date=January 2015}} Forced labour can, likewise, be used simply to cut production costs by private and public industries (e.g. cocoa plantations), or can be a form of involuntary servitude in the private sector – [[sweatshops]].&lt;ref&gt;Miers, Suzanne. "Contemporary Forms of Slavery". ''Canadian Journal of African Studies'' 34, no. 3 (2000): 734.&lt;/ref&gt; Bales refers to this type of slavery as contract slavery, where “contracts are offered which guarantee employment, perhaps in a workshop or factory, but when the workers are taken to their place of employment they discover that they have instead been taken into slavery...it is a way of making slavery seem legitimate and necessary”.&lt;ref&gt;Bales, Kevin. "Expendable People: Slavery in the Age of Globalization." Journal of International Affairs 53, no. 2 (2000): 464.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of law, "social purpose" is a scheme of [[statutory construction]] declaring that a statute should not be construed in a way that would violate normal societal values or good. Example of cases in which this [[rules of construction|rule of construction]] was used include ''[[Riggs v. Palmer]]'' and ''[[Holy Trinity Church v. United States]].''

Jimerson and Williams were sentenced to death, Adams to 75 years in jail and Rainge to life. Following the murder in 1978, the four spent almost two decades in prison before being released in 1996. This miscarriage of justice was due to false forensic testimony, coercion of a prosecution witness, perjury by another witness who had an incentive to lie, and prosecution and police misconduct. The DNA evidence uncovered in the investigation to clear their names eventually lead to the arrest and conviction of the real killers.

==Murder and first trial==
On May 11, 1978, 28 year old Lawrence Lionberg (who was working a night shift at a [[Homewood, Illinois]] gas station) and his 23 year old fiancé Carol Schmal were kidnapped.  Schmal was raped several times and both were shot in the back of the head.&lt;ref name = Tribune201404&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-04-11/news/ct-ford-heights-four-met-20140411_1_two-decades-ford-heights-four-northwest-indiana/2|title=Ford Heights 4 exonerated but not free from past|last=Mills|first=Steve|date=2014-04-11|website=Chicago Tribune|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a public outcry at the brutal murder.

The four suspects were tried in 1978. A witness, Charles McCraney, claimed to have seen  Williams, Rainge and Adams near the crime scene area in [[Ford Heights, Illinois|Ford Heights]] (at the time called East Chicago Heights) at the time of the crime. A state expert witness, Michael Podlecki, said that at least one of the rapists was type A secretor blood (shared by 25% of the population) and Williams and Adams had Type A secretor blood (an independent forensic witness found in 1987 that Williams and Adams actually had non-secretor blood). Podlecki also claimed that hairs from the back of Williams car were consistent with Lionberg and Schmal.&lt;ref name = Williams/&gt; No other physical evidence matched the suspects to the crime. A convict, David Jackson, testified that he had overheard Williams and Rainge in jail discussing the murder and rape (Jackson later admitted he had fabricated this evidence because he was offered a deal by the authorities). The prosecution eliminated all black jurors from the trial (the defendants were all black and the murder victims were white).  The police did not inform the defense that a witness, Marvin Simpson, heard shots and identified four men running from the murder scene - Arthur Robinson, Juan Rodriguez, Ira and Dennis Johnson (these four were later found to be the real killers). Family members of the Ford Four testified they were elsewhere at the time of the murder.  The defendants' lawyer, Archie B. Weston, was ineffective, was the subject of a legal disciplinary hearing at the time and was later disbarred from being a lawyer for another offense.  A witness, Paula Gray, (with an IQ of 55&lt;ref name =Crime&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of High-tech Crime and Crime-fighting|last=Newton|first=Michael|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2003|isbn=9781438129860|location=|pages=119–120|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), testified to prosecutors that she had seen the defendants shoot the victims and rape Schmal. However, she withdrew her evidence before the court case and prosecutors charged her with murder and perjury.  Williams was sentenced to death, while Adams was sentenced to 75 years, Rainge to life, and Paula Gray to 50 years in 1978. Jimerson could not be charged as McCraney had not mentioned Jimerson in his testimony and Paula Gray had withdrawn her testimony.&lt;ref name = Gray/&gt;

== Appeals and further trials ==
On appeal, the [[Supreme Court of Illinois|Illinois supreme court]] reversed the convictions of Williams and Rainge in 1982 because the defendants lawyer was incompetent and was the subject of a legal disciplinary hearing.  Prosecutors offered Paula Gray a deal to get out of jail if she testified she had seen Jimerson, Williams and Rainge shoot the victims and rape Schmal and she accepted.  In 1985 McCraney had changed his evidence to include seeing Jimerson who was sentenced to death. In 1987 Williams was sentenced to death and Rainge to life at a retrial. Paula Gray was released from prison in 1987.&lt;ref name = Gray&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/legalclinic/wrongfulconvictions/exonerations/il/paula-gray.html|title=Paula Gray, Paula Gray confessed to a role in a crime she knew nothing about, sending herself and four innocent men to prison, two of them to death row|last=|first=|date=|website=Center on Wrongful Convictions: Bluhm Legal Clinic,|publisher=Northwestern Pritzker School of Law|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exoneration==
Three female students, including [[Laura Sullivan]] who is now an award-winning investigative correspondent for [[NPR]], working under Professor David Protess of the [[Northwestern University]] [[Medill School of Journalism]] investigated this case and found the Marvin Simpson witness statement testifying seeing Robinson, Rodriguez, Ira and Dennis Johnson fleeing from the murder scene. Jackson and Paula  Gray recanted their evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/northwestern/spring99/trio.htm|title=Trio of Angels, Three students help free four death row inmates.|last=L. A.|first=|date=Spring 1999|website=|publisher=Northwestern University Magazine|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students also got DNA tests done which showed  Jimerson, Williams, Adams and Rainge were innocent and, eventually, that Robinson, Rodriguez, Ira and Dennis Johnson were guilty and three of them confessed (Dennis Johnson had died by then).  The Ford Heights Four were exonerated and freed in 1996.&lt;ref name = Tribune199607&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-07-03/news/9607030109_1_carol-schmal-four-men-murder-and-rape-charges|title=3 Convicted Of Murders Are Finally Exonerated; No Apology As Judge Dismisses 1978 Case|last=Fegelaman|first=Andrew|date=1996-07-03|website=Chicago Tribune|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford Heights Four received $36 million in 1999 in civil rights damages from Cook County - the largest settlement in US history at the time.&lt;ref name = CBS&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/36-million-for-wrongful-conviction/|title=$36 Million For Wrongful Conviction|last=Bowers|first=Cynthia|date=1999-03-05|website=CBS News|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Ryan]] the Governor of Illinois, declared a moratorium on the state's death penalty in 2000 citing the Ford Heights Four as one example of men who would have been executed if it had not been for the unpaid work of the Northwestern University journalism professors and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eye of the Hurricane: My Path from Darkness to Freedom|last=Hurricane Carter|first=Rubin|last2=Klonsky|first2=Ken|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2011|isbn=9781569768228|location=|pages=218|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2433">[[File:Hispaniola Treaty of Aranjuez 1777.jpg|thumb|Contemporary map showing the border situation on Hispaniola following the treaty]]
The '''Treaty of Aranjuez''' was signed on June 3, 1777, between France and Spain. Based on the terms of the treaty, the two countries agreed to define the border of their respective colonies on the island of [[Hispaniola|Santo Domingo]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]] which they shared ownership of. Spain made substantial gains in the upper Artibonite Valley in middle section of the island. The new border was to be marked by border stones. It was signed at [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez|Aranjuez Palace]] near [[Madrid]] in [[Spain]]. It was one of a number of diplomatic agreements signed at the palace in the eighteenth century and should not be confused with the 1779 [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)|Treaty of Aranjuez]] between the two states which led to Spain's entry into the [[American War of Independence]].

==Aftermath==
The northernmost and southernmost part of the international border between [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]] still conforms to the boundaries between French and Spanish colonies agreed to in the Treaty of Aranjuez. However, in the 20th century, the middle portion of the boundary was changed to make it closer to a straight north–south line and thereby transferred a large portion of [[Hispaniola]] from the Dominican Republic to Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuestrafrontera.org/wordpress/2009/09/the-birth-of-haitian-dominican-border/ {{DL|date=November 2016}}] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020103617/http://nuestrafrontera.org/wordpress/2009/09/the-birth-of-haitian-dominican-border/ |date=October 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An original boundary stone is on display in the [[Museo de las Casas Reales]], [[Santo Domingo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6292">{{nihongo|'''Unemployment insurance'''|雇用保険|koyou hoken}}, also known as  {{nihongo|失業保険|shitsugyou hoken}} is the "user pays" system of [[unemployment benefits]] that operate in Japan. It is paired with {{nihongo|[[Workers' Accident Compensation Insurance (Japan)|Workers' Accident Compensation Insurance]]|労働者災害補償保険|rousai hoken}} and referred to collectively as {{nihongo|[[Labor Insurance (Japan)|Labor insurance]]|労働保険|roudou hoken}}.&lt;ref&gt;JETRO website [http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/setting_up/laws/section4/page9.html 4.9.1 Labor and social insurance systems] Retrieved on June 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Population and Social Security Research [http://www.ipss.go.jp/s-info/e/ssj2014/009.html] Retrieved on November 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It is managed by [[Hello Work]].

==System==
Japanese unemployment insurance is closer to the [[Unemployment benefits#United States|US]] or [[Unemployment benefits#Canada|Canadian]] "user pays" system than the taxpayer funded systems in place in countries such as the [[Unemployment benefits#United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Unemployment benefits#New Zealand|New Zealand]], or [[Unemployment benefits#Australia|Australia]]. It is paid for by contributions by both the employer and employee.&lt;ref&gt;Tokyo Employment Service Center for Foreigners website [http://tokyo-foreigner.jsite.mhlw.go.jp/english/seekers_1/spec/spec_1d.html For foreign nationals working in Japan] Retrieved on November 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
Workers enrolling in unemployment insurance must be working at least 20 hours per week, and to expect to be employed for at least 31 days. Employees who are dispatched to Japan from overseas and who already have coverage in a similar scheme are not required to enroll in Japanese unemployment insurance.&lt;ref&gt;JETRO website [http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/setting_up/laws/section4/page9.html 4.9.1 Labor and social insurance systems] Retrieved on June 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures==
On leaving a job, employees are supposed to be given a "Rishoku-hyo" document showing their ID number (the same number is supposed to be used by later employers), employment periods, and pay (which contributions are linked to). The reason for leaving is also documented separately.

==Premiums==
Premiums are calculated as a certain percentage of each worker's total wage. Under the latest revision in April 2016, the insurance premium rate is 1.10% (the employer paying 0.7% and the worker paying 0.4%) with the exception of a few kinds of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;JETRO website [https://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/setting_up/laws/section4/page9.html Laws &amp; Regulations on Setting Up Business in Japan  - Section 4.

==Payments==
The circumstances under which an employee left their position affect eligibility, timing, and amount of benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justlanded.com/english/Japan/Japan-Guide/Jobs/Employment-insurance Unemployment benefits in Japan]&lt;/ref&gt; The length of time that unemployed workers can receive benefits depends on the age of the employee, and how long they have been employed and paying in.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Population and Social Security Research [http://www.ipss.go.jp/s-info/e/ssj2014/pdf/Table9_5.pdf Table 9.5 Outline of the Employment Insurance System in Japan] Retrieved on November 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vagrancy Act 1824''' (5 Geo. 4. c. 83) is an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] that makes it an offence to [[Homelessness|sleep rough]] or [[Begging|beg]]. It remains in force in [[England and Wales]], and anyone found to be sleeping in a public place or to be trying to [[Begging|beg]] for money can be arrested.

Contemporary critics, including [[William Wilberforce]], condemned the Act for being a catch-all offence because it did not consider the circumstances as to why an individual might be placed in such a predicament.

==Background==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
The law was enacted to deal with the increasing numbers of homeless and penniless urban poor in England and Wales following the conclusion of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815. Nine years after the [[Battle of Waterloo]] the [[British Army]] and [[British Navy]] had undergone a massive reduction in size, leaving large numbers of [[Military discharge|discharge]]d military personnel without jobs or accommodation. Many were living rough on the streets or in makeshift camps. At the same time a massive influx of economic migrants from [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] arrived in England, especially London, in search of work. Politicians in the [[unreformed House of Commons]] became concerned that [[parish constable]]s were becoming ineffective in controlling these "vagrants". Further, the medieval [[Passport|pass laws]] which gave itinerant travelling people  free movement through a given district were considered to be no longer effective.

==Offences==
Punishment for the wide definition of vagrancy (including prostitution) was up to one month's [[penal labour|hard labour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Act for the Punishment of Idle and Disorderly Persons, and Rogues and Vagabonds, in That Part of Great Britain Called England|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1824/83/pdfs/ukpga_18240083_en.pdf|pages=698–706|accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Act of 1824 was amended several times, most notably by the [[Vagrancy Act 1838]], which introduced a number of new public order offences covering acts that were deemed at the time to be likely to cause moral outrage. It contained a provision for the prosecution of "every Person wilfully exposing to view, in any Street... or public Place, any obscene Print, Picture, or other indecent Exhibition".&lt;ref&gt;HC Deb 25 June 1991 c861.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the Act of 1824 originally applied only to [[England and Wales]], Section 4 of the Act, which dealt mainly with vagrancy and begging, was extended to [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]] by section 15 of the Prevention of Crimes Act 1871.

The Vagrancy Act 1898 prohibited [[Solicitation|soliciting]] or importuning for immoral purposes. Originally intended as a measure against [[prostitution]], in practice the legislation was almost solely used to convict men for [[Sodomy law|gay sex]].&lt;ref name="LaceyBrian"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lacey|first= Brian|year=2008|title= Terrible Queer Creatures: Homosexuality in Irish History|publisher= Dublin: Wordwell|isbn=978-1905569236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Criminal Law Amendment Act 1912, extended provisions of the 1824 Act to Scotland and Ireland, and gave further protection to women and girls through the suppression of [[brothel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Reform Commission (1985). ''Report on Vagrancy and Related Offences'' (Dublin: LRC (Ireland)) p. 6f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
Certain sections of the original Vagrancy Act 1824 remain in force in England and Wales.  However ss.3 and 4 were repealed by Vagrancy Offences (Repeal) Act 1981, effectively legalising or decriminalising 'begging' in all circumstances.  In 1982 the entire Act was repealed in Scotland by the [[Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982|Civic Government (Scotland) Act]]. Section 18 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 (Ireland) repealed section 4 of the 1824 Act (begging and vagrancy) in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0012/index.html|work=Irish Statute Book|title=Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Act discharged military personnel continue to be granted exemption certificates allowing them to appeal for [[alms]] under certain circumstances.

===Modern use===
In 1988 some 573 people were prosecuted and convicted under the Act in England and Wales. In May 1990 the [[National Association of Probation Officers]] carried out a survey of prosecutions under the Act. That survey revealed that 1,250 prosecutions had been dealt with in 14 magistrates courts in Central London in 1988, which represented an enormous leap in the number of prosecutions under the Act, especially in London.

In 2014 three men were arrested and charged under Section 4 of the 1824 Vagrancy Act for stealing food that had been put in [[Skip (container)|skips]] and [[Waste container|bins]] outside an [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland]] [[supermarket]] in [[Kentish Town]], [[North London]]. Paul May, William James and Jason Chan were due to stand trial after allegedly taking cheese, tomatoes and cakes worth £33 from bins behind the shop. The Iceland chain denied any involvement in contacting the police, and in a public statement it questioned why the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS) felt that it was in the public interest to pursue a case against the three individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The three men, all of [[no fixed abode|no fixed address]], were due to attend a hearing at Highbury [[Magistrates' Court]] on 3 February 2014. However, before that date the CPS announced its decision to drop the case, stating that it felt it had not given due weight to the public interest factors tending against prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;
