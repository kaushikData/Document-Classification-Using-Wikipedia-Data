      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5427">The '''Bachelor of Talmudic law''' ('''BTL'''), '''Bachelor of Talmudic Studies''' '''(BTS)''' and '''First Talmudic Degree''' ('''FTD''') are [[law degree|law degrees]], comprising the study, analysis and application of ancient [[Talmudical]], [[Bible|Biblical]], and other historical sources. The laws derived from these texts comprise the origin of many of today’s [[judicial system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawandliberty.org/justice.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program content ==
Undergraduate programs conferring this degree involve studying the legal principles and concepts of [[Jewish Law]], covering civil, criminal and matrimonial law. The course also includes the study of applicable [[tort]], [[property law|property]] and [[contract law]]. Furthermore, the program also covers legal [[jurisprudence]], judicial systems – including the validity of witnesses and judges – and [[dispute resolution]]. A large part of the curriculum focuses on [[textual analysis]], principles of logic, [[game theory]], probability calculus, and critical reasoning. Many programs emphasize the cosmopolitan implications of the principal content areas, thus preparing graduates to assume leadership and professional positions in a wide array of professional and academic fields. Almost all the studied texts are in [[Aramaic]] or [[Hebrew]], and the program requires a working knowledge of both languages to facilitate the understanding and examination of these sources. In many institutions, this degree is a prerequisite to the study for [[Semicha]], Rabbinic [[Ordination]]. At accredited institutions this degree requires 120 credit hours of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.talmudicu.edu/ep_bachelor_degrees.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307015228/http://www.talmudicu.edu/ep_bachelor_degrees.php |archive-date=2010-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of case studies===
An example of a specific case studied is that of an agricultural business with annual tax obligations, wanting to pay its tithe early, using estimation to evaluate the required amount. Legal discussion is based around the issue of interest charged if the amount proves too high, and extra benefit if the approximated figure falls below that for this year's crop. Obviously, such cases have clear parallels to those arising in the English legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JLI comes to Singapore!!!|url=http://singaporeoutreach.blogspot.com/2008/11/jli-comes-to-singapore.html|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional illustration of the use these ancient concepts in modern-day use is the precedent in ''Haley v London Electricity Board'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1964/3.html&lt;/ref&gt; holding liable the owner of such holes or public dangers that may cause injury to unaware passers-by. In Jewish law this concept is known as “pits in public thoroughfares” and has wide-reaching tort implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education for Happiness|url=http://www.vaildaily.com/|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation and recognition==
The [[Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools]] (AARTS) and the Association of Institutions of Jewish Studies (AIJS) are specifically recognized to accredit Talmudic degrees. 

In North America, five entities that accredit religious schools in particular are recognized by the [[United States Department of Education]] and four (excluding AIJS, which is a new accreditor) by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|url=http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg8.html| title=Accreditation in the United States: Specialized Accreditation Agencies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE)
* [[Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools]] (AARTS)
* Association of Institutions of Jewish Studies (AIJS)
* [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]] (ATS)
* [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]] (TRACS)

Since all these accreditors meet  [[United States Department of Education]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg10.html "United States Department of Education"&lt;/ref&gt; recognition criteria, and most the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chea.org/Directories/faith.asp {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66ixfHHc0?url=http://www.chea.org/Directories/faith.asp |date=2012-04-06 }} "Council for Higher Education Accreditation"&lt;/ref&gt; as well, their standards correspond to those of regional accreditors. Contrary to the principles laid out by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] in Transfer and the Public Interest: A Statement to the Community,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chea.org/pdf/transfer_state_02.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030030718/http://www.chea.org/pdf/transfer_state_02.pdf |date=2012-10-30 }} "Transfer and the Public Interest: A Statement to the Community"&lt;/ref&gt; many regionally accredited institutions continue to base transfer credit decisions solely or primarily upon regional accreditation.

'''Beşparmak Mountains''' ([[Latin]]: Latmus; [[Ancient Greek]]: Λάτμος) are a [[ridge]] of many [[Mountain spur|spurs]] located in the [[Muğla Province|Muğla]] and [[Aydın Province|Aydın]] provinces of [[Turkey]], running in an east-west direction along the north shore of the former '''Latmian Gulf'''&lt;ref&gt;[[:uk:Латмійська затока]]&lt;/ref&gt; on the coast of [[Caria]], which became part of Hellenised [[Ionia]]. The city of Latmus, located on the south slopes of Mount Latmus {{convert|25|km|mi}} east of [[Miletus]],&lt;ref&gt;Turkish Milet, not to be confused with Turkish [[Milas]].&lt;/ref&gt; was originally a port on the narrow gulf, as reported by [[Strabo]].&lt;ref name=Strabo14.1.8&gt;{{cite web|author=Strabo|title=Geography 14.1.8|publisher=Tufts University: Perseus Project|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0198&amp;query=book%3D14%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D8|accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that Latmus is the same as '''Mount Phthires''' in the [[Catalogue of Trojans]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' Book II line 868.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mouth of the Gulf of Latmus began to fill with sediment from the [[Maeander]] (Büyük Menderes) river, which emptied into it, even in classical antiquity. By 300 CE [[Lake Bafa]] had formed behind the estuary marshes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brückner |first=Helmut |chapter=Delta Evolution and Culture - Aspects of Geoarchaeological Research in Miletos and Priene |year=2003 |title=Troia and the Troad: Scientific Approaches |editor-last=Wagner |editor-first=Günther A. |editor2-last=Pernicka |editor2-first=Ernst |editor3-last=Uerpmann |editor3-first=Peter |pages=122–125 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3540437118}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gradually diminished in salinity and would now be fresh water except that canals to the Aegean introduce a saline element. The ecology remains a brackish-water one and the lake has been made a bird sanctuary. Its area of {{convert|7|km2|mi2}} with a maximum depth of {{convert|25|m|ft}} still extends from the base of the west spur of Mount Latmus, although, having lost its port, the ancient medium-sized town of '''Herakleia''' (Latmus) has declined in size and facilities to the small village of '''Kapikiri'''.

Beşparmak looms far beyond Kapikiri to the east for a total distance of about {{convert|35|km|mi}}, {{convert|5|km|mi}} to {{convert|10|km|mi}} wide. It is deeply eroded by various streams into spurs. The spur that can be seen from Kapikiri is one Dağ, or "mountain", but the entire ridge with all the spurs is Dağlar, "mountains", in the sense of "range." The ancient writers generally recognized the western spur over the gulf as Latmus, but Strabo reports that the ridge east was called '''Mount Grium''' and extended through [[Caria]].&lt;ref name=Strabo14.1.8/&gt;

==Geology==
[[Image:Aegean Sea and Anatolian Plates map-fr.png|thumb|left|300px|The Arabian plate at 15 converges into the Anatolian Plate at 21 against the purple line (East Anatolian Fault). The Anatolian Plate moves west slipping along the North Anatolian Fault (green) but there is some north-south extension along the red border, which continues into the Aegean Plate at 37. It is opening the old subduction zone and uncovering the massifs, which have arisen as the [[Cyclades]] and the Menderes Massif.]]
The [[Morphotectonics|morphotectonic]] configuration of [[Anatolia]] and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] is a result of [[Plate tectonics|continental drift movements]] associated with the [[Alpine orogeny]], a zone of mountain-building caused by the collision of the [[African Plate|African]] and [[Arabian Plate]]s with the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The former have been slipping under the latter compressing and lifting the edge and creating zones of [[metamorphic rock]] from previous layers of [[sedimentary rock]]. These zones in the Aegean are represented by a number of [[massif]]s that were originally buried by crustal [[subduction]]: the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]], Kazdag, Menderes, [[Cycladic Massif]] and Crete.

For various geologic reasons, modelled differently by different geologists, the zone of compression in the Aegean became one of [[Rift|extension]]: the region widened and dome-like or ovoid massifs were uncovered, or exhumed, from the subduction zones and rose by [[isostasy]]. In the case of the Menderes Massif, which is {{convert|40000|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}, the reasons are better known due to geologic research in central Turkey. Anatolia is a triangular block created by the intersection in central Turkey of the North and East Anatolian faults. As the northward-pressing Arabian Plate pushes against this wedge the latter slips to the west but the broad end opens along fault lines like the rays of a fan, extending the massif to the north-northeast and south. This is being called a bivergent (diverges in two places) model.

The entire massif is divided or nearly so by a [[karst topography]] into three sections: the Gordes Massif north of the Alasehir or [[Gediz river|Gediz]] [[graben]], the Cine Massif south of the [[Büyük Menderes]] graben and the Central Massif between. The latter is split like a forked tongue by the [[Küçük Menderes]] Graben into the Kuzey Detachment to the north and the Guney Detachment to the south. [[Mycale]] is part of the Guney Detachment, while Latmus is in the Cine Massif.

The Graben are low-key [[rift valley]]s. There have been some small intrusions of [[magma]] into the graben appearing now as granito-diorite outcrops. Dates on thin sections of [[monazite]] obtained from the earliest exhumed rocks of the graben suggest  "... that the Cenozoic extension in the Gordes Massif, and possibly the entire Menderes Massif, might have begun in the [[Late Oligocene]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Catlos|first=E.J.|author2=Ibrahim Çemen|title=Monazite ages and the evolution of the Menderes Massif, western Turkey|journal=International Journal of Earth Science|volume=94|page=204|publisher=UCLA SIMS|year=2005|url=http://sims.ess.ucla.edu/PDF/Catlos_Cemen_IJES_2005.pdf|accessdate=2008-02-25|doi=10.1007/s00531-005-0470-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the rare intrusions, the massif is not of volcanic origin. Most of the visible layer is light, metamorphic rock of various kinds, especially [[marble]] and [[schist]]s.

Except for [[alluvial fan]]s of impermeable [[clay]] the rock is highly porous due to a network of small faults, which dips into the warmer regions below the surface. Warm springs and vapors are common, giving the appearance of volcanic activity. The ancients cross-culturally viewed these phenomena as being caused by divinities, which rock-paintings indicate they worshipped. The north slopes of Latmus are subject to heavy and damaging mudslides, which also would have contributed to the idea that it was a god.

==Mythology==
Latmus appears in [[Greek mythology]] as the site of the cave where [[Selene]]'s consort [[Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]] lies forever young and beautiful in blissful sleep.

==Prehistory==
Beginning in 1994 about 170 rock paintings have been discovered in shallow caves and overhangs near springs at the foot of Mount Latmus overlooking Lake Bafa.&lt;ref name=hur&gt;{{Cite news|title=Unique rock paintings reveal traces of prehistoric human settlement in Anatolia|newspaper=Turkish Daily News|date=January 18, 2007|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=unique-rock-paintings-reveal-traces-of-prehistoric-human-settlement-in-anatolia-2007-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They came to light in a survey conducted by Anneliese Peschlow of the German Archaeology Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dainst.org/index.php?id=645&amp;sessionLanguage=en Deutsches Archäologisches Institut.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716104611/http://www.dainst.org/index.php?id=645&amp;sessionLanguage=en |date=July 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peschlow dates the earliest to about 6000 BCE and believes from other findings that the region has been continuously occupied since then. She is currently working to get Mount Latmus reserved as a national park.

The paintings, which are done entirely in red, depict mainly social and religious scenes. Different representations of the mountain include a dragon, indicating that it was worshipped as a god; that is, Latmus was a sacred mountain at least as early as the [[Early Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name=hur /&gt;

A 2004 [[Palynology|palynological study]] of two sediment [[Core sample|cores]] taken from [[Lake Bafa]] near Kapikiri (Baf S1) and from the western depth (Baf S6) suggests a habitation sequence of the [[Büyük Menderes River]] valley and the shores of Latmus that appears to support the early history of the region. Baf S1, containing the oldest sediment, is layered in four subsections, the first [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dated]] to before 4000 BCE.

From the pollen of subsection 1 a model can be constructed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Müllenhoff |first=Marc |last2=Handl |first2=Mathias |last3=Knipping |first3=Maria |last4=Brückner |first4=Halmut |year=2004 |title=The evolution of Lake Bafa (Western Turkey) - Sedimentological, microfaunal and palynological results |journal=Geographie der Meere und Kusten: Coastline Reports 1 |editor-last=Schernewski |editor-first=G. |editor2-last=Dolch |editor2-first=T. |pages=55–66 |location=Rostock |publisher=EUCC |issn=0928-2734 |url=http://databases.eucc-d.de/files/documents/00000342_AMK2004_Artikel_Muellenhoff.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a lightly grazed [[Climax community|climax forest]] of [[deciduous]] oak and pine: 27.6% [[Quercus pubescens]], 14.6% [[Pinus]] and lesser concentrations of [[Isoetes histrix]]. Low levels of the pasture weed, [[Plantago lanceolata]], indicate a low level of grazing by animals belonging to [[Indigenous peoples|indigenes]] that lived somewhere else. There is no evidence that they settled or grew crops in the region.

Subsection 2, dated 1240/1126 BCE to 710/558 BCE, represents a settlement from the [[Beyşehir]] Occupation Phase of southern Anatolia, dated there 3500/3000 BP to 1500 BP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Behre |first=Karl-Ernst |chapter=Some reflections on the anthropogenic indicators and the record of prehistoric occupation phases in pollen diagrams from the Near East |year=1990 |title=Man's Role in the Shaping of the Eastern Mediterranean Landscape |editor-last=Bottema |editor-first=S. |editor2-last=Entjes-Nieborg |editor2-first=G. |editor3-last=Van Zeist |editor3-first=W. |page=219 ff. |place=Rotterdam, Brookfield |publisher=A.A. Balkema |isbn=9061911389}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a specific palynological profile of "secondary anthropogenic indicators;" that is, not pollen of cultivated plants but of other species growing on cultivated land: certain percentages of [[Plantago lanceolata]], [[Sanguisorba minor]], [[Pistacia]], [[Platanus]], [[Quercus calliprinos]] and [[Juniperus]].

The Lake Bafu profile shows the replacement of deciduous oak and pine with [[maquis shrubland|maquis]] species: [[Phillyrea]], [[Cistus]], [[Ericaceae]]; fruit trees: [[Olea]], [[Chestnut|Castanea]]; and farm weeds: Plantago lanceolata and Juniperus. Carbon in the sediment suggests the forest was cleared by [[slash and burn]]. This period corresponds to the settlement of the [[Carians]] in the area, who apparently moved in from southern Anatolia. There is a semi-legendary tradition that they subdued another Pre-Hellenic people, the [[Leleges]], but the evidence is not precise enough to say if the indigenes were all or partly Leleges. As the Carians worshipped [[Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]], he may have been brought in at this time.

Subsection 3 reveals an abandonment of the cleared areas, the decline of [[Olea]], and the spread of [[Pistacia]], [[Pinus brutia]] and [[Quercus coccifera]] (instead of deciduous oak) on formerly cleared land and in the maquis. As this is the time of the rise of [[Ionia]], the palynological scenario suggests a movement of population from the land to the newly settled or expanded big cities of the [[Ionian League]]. Subsection 4 and Baf S6 go on to catalogue the return of the fruit trees, re-clearing the land for pasture, planting of rye and other cereals, ultimate destabilization of the soil through over-use, denudation and acceleration of sedimentation. After the sealing off of the bay to form the lake, population and land use declined to their current low levels around Latmus, but the river valley is cultivated.

==History==
[[File:Miletus Bay silting evolution map-en.svg|thumb|right|250px|Location of Mount Latmus South of [[Büyük Menderes River|Maeander River]]'s mouth.]]

Latmus became a member of the [[Delian League]] in the fifth century BCE. In the fourth century the Persian satrap (a Carian) [[Mausolus of Halicarnassus]] captured the city by a ruse&lt;ref&gt;[[Polyainos]] 7.23.2 reports the capture of Latmos by Mausolos, and 8.53.4 by Artemisia as sole ruler.&lt;/ref&gt; and fortified it with a circuit wall;&lt;ref&gt;The wall, originally with sixty-five towers (''Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites'' 1976), is one of the best-preserved urban fortifications of Antiquity.&lt;/ref&gt; under Hellenising influence the city was refounded a kilometer to the west&lt;ref&gt;The old city site became a [[necropolis]].&lt;/ref&gt; on a rectilinear grid system&lt;ref&gt;The rectilinear grid of streets typical of Hellenistic foundations is traditionally credited to Alexander's architect [[Hippodamus of Miletus]].&lt;/ref&gt; as Heracleia under Latmos,&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not '''Alexandria by Latmus''' was identical to this Heracleia is still an open question, according to Getzel M. Cohen, ''The Hellenistic Settlements in Europe, the Islands, and Asia Minor.'' (Hellenistic Culture and Society, '''17''')     (Berkeley:  University of California Press) 1995: 245f; the city was called s also called Pleistarcheia for a while (pp. 261-263).&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to the hero [[Heracles]].&lt;ref&gt;''Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites'' 1976; see also P.M. Fraser, ''Cities of Alexander the Great'' (Oxford 1996:28-29) and A.W. McNicoll, ''Hellenistic Fortifications from the Aegean to the Euphrates'' (Oxford 1997:75-81).&lt;/ref&gt; The modern village of '''Kapıkırı''' is built among the ruins.

The ''[[temenos]]'', or sanctuary of Endymion, with pre-Greek origins, was rebuilt in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic times]], and may still be seen on a rise to the south of the ancient city.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] remarked "The [[Elis|Eleians]] and the Herakleians near Miletos tell different stories about Endymion's death; the Eleians show you Endymion's tomb but the Herakleians say he went away to Mount Latmos, where they honour him and have a holy place of Endymion." (v.1.5).&lt;/ref&gt; The building faces the southwest; it has a [[cella]] with a horseshoe-shaped rear wall partly cut out of the bedrock, with an entrance hall and columned forecourt.

A temple of Athena at Heracleia reveals its earlier foundation by not being aligned with the Hellenistic street pattern.

In [[Byzantine]] times, the mountain, known as '''Latros''', became a flourishing monastic centre. According to tradition, the first monastic community was established by [[Sinai]]te monks fleeing from the [[Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century. By the early 10th century, there were three monasteries, and by 1222, the monastic community of Latros numbered 11 monasteries. It began declining however towards the century's end due to increasing Turkish attacks, and disappeared in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor-first = Alexander | editor-last = Kazhdan |editor-link=Alexander Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | pages = 1188–1189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Endymion was [[Christianization|Christianised]] as a mystic saint, whose coffin was opened annually and whose bones emitted musical tones&lt;ref&gt;Peter Levi, ed. ''Pausanias, Guide to Greece'' 1979:198 note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the site drew pilgrims. In the ninth century, [[Joseph the Hymnographer]] was tonsured in the monastery of Latmus.

In 2018, four kilometers of the ancient stone road, which connects the ancient cities of [[Alinda]] and Latmus, have been destroyed by villagers to make way for their [[olive groves]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/ancient-road-destroyed-to-make-way-for-villagers-olive-groves-in-aydin-127634 Ancient road destroyed to make way for villagers’ olive groves in Aydın]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
*Daishō-in was founded by the monk '''[[Kūkai]]''', also known posthumously as {{nihongo|'''Kōbō-Daishi'''|弘法大師||}}, in the year 806, the 1st year of the [[Daidō|Daidō era]]. 
:Kūkai was one of the most famous [[bhikshu|monk]]s in Japan and the founder of [[Shingon Buddhism]]. 
:Made head temple of one of denomination of Shingon Buddhism and the oldest temple on Itsukushima.
*By an Imperial order of [[Emperor Toba]], it was the place to pray for the peace and security of the nation.
*[[Emperor Meiji]] stayed there on July 31, 1885 for his visit to [[Itsukushima Shrine]].
*Repair work for the trail to [[Mount Misen (Miyajima)|Mt. Misen]] was finished in 1905.
:It was done by the donation of [[Itō Hirobumi]].
*Heavy damage by 19th typhoon on September 27, 1991.
*Held a memorial service to congratulate the restoration of the damage on October 10, 1998.
*The [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|14th Dalai Lama]] visited Itsukushima to celebrate the 1200th-year of Daishō-in from 3 to 8 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japanese-religions.jp/publications/assets/JR33_a_Repp.pdf  Martin Repp, H.H. The 14th Dalai Lama and the Japanese Buddhists, An Account and Analysis of Complicated Interactions, Japanese Religions Vol. 33 (1 &amp; 2): 103-125]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Destroy 2000 Years of Culture''''' is a song by [[Atari Teenage Riot]], released as the fourth and final single from their 1997 album ''[[The Future of War]]''. The single was released as a 12" vinyl record and as a limited edition CD, with only 500 copies made. The CD edition contains an unlisted hidden track: An instrumental version of the B-side "Paranoid".

==Overview==
The track revolves around a sample of the track "Dead Skin Mask" by [[Slayer]], from their 1990 album ''[[Seasons in the Abyss]]''.&lt;ref name="whosampled"&gt;{{cite web|last1=N/A|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/64823/Atari-Teenage-Riot-Destroy-2000-Years-of-Culture-Slayer-Dead-Skin-Mask/|website=whosampled.com|publisher=whosampled.com|accessdate=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains rapping by [[Alec Empire]].

A [[music video]] was produced for the track, which shows Alec Empire rapping against grainy, highly saturated footage with a metal device in his neck. Also shown are brief clips of fellow band members [[Carl Crack]] and [[Hanin Elias]] standing in front of an what appears to be an apocalyptic setting.

The Article 20 of the [[Constitution of Japan|Japanese Constitution]] provides for '''[[freedom of religion]] in [[Japan]]''', and the government generally respects this right in practice.

==Religious demography==
{{main|Religion in Japan}}

The [[government of Japan]] does not require religious groups to report their membership, so it was difficult to accurately determine the number of adherents to different religious groups. The [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] reported in 2017 that membership claims by religious groups totaled 182 million.&lt;ref name="Yearbook"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.bunka.go.jp/tokei_hakusho_shuppan/hakusho_nenjihokokusho/shukyo_nenkan/pdf/h29nenkan.pdf |title= 宗教年鑑 平成29年版 |trans-title= Religious Yearbook, 2017 |pages= 46-49 |language= ja |accessdate= 2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is out of a total population of 127 million, but does not account for overlapping memberships (some families may be registered at both a Buddhist temple and a Shinto shrine), or double membership due to change of address. This number, which is nearly twice Japan's population, reflects many citizens' affiliation with [[syncretism|multiple religions]]. For example, it is very common for Japanese to practice both [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] and [[Shinto]] rites.

According to the Agency's annual yearbook, 85 million persons identify themselves as [[Shinto]], 88 million as Buddhist, 2 million as [[Christianity in Japan|Christian]], and 8 million follow "other" religions, including [[Tenrikyo]], [[Seicho-no-Ie]], the [[Church of World Messianity]], and [[PL Kyodan]].&lt;ref name="Yearbook" /&gt; Academics estimate that there are 120 thousand [[Muslim]]s in Japan, 10 percent of whom are Japanese citizens. The Israeli Embassy estimates that there are approximately 2,000 [[Jews]] in the country, most of them foreign-born.

As of December 2017, under the 1951 Religious Juridical Persons Law, the Government recognized 157 schools of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.bunka.go.jp/tokei_hakusho_shuppan/hakusho_nenjihokokusho/shukyo_nenkan/pdf/h29nenkan.pdf |title= 宗教年鑑 平成29年版 |trans-title= Religious Yearbook, 2017 |page= 8 |language= ja |accessdate= 2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six major schools of Buddhism are [[Tendai]], [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]], [[Jōdō]], [[Zen]] ([[Sōtō]] and [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] sects), [[Nichiren]], and [[Nanto Rokushū]]. In addition, there are a number of Buddhist lay organizations, including [[Soka Gakkai]], which reported a membership of eight million. The two main schools of Shinto are the [[Association of Shinto Shrines]] and Kyohashinto.

==Status of religious freedom==
===Legal and policy framework===
The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the government respects this right in practice. At all levels, the Japanese Government seeks to protect this right in full and does not tolerate its abuse, either by governmental or private actors.

As of December 2016, 181,098 out of 216,927 religious groups were certified by the government as religious organizations with corporate status, according to the Agency for Cultural Affairs.&lt;ref name="Yearbook" /&gt; The government does not require religious groups to register or apply for certification; however, certified religious organizations receive tax benefits. More than 83 percent of religious groups were certified by 2016.

In the wake of the [[Tokyo subway sarin attack|1995 sarin gas attack on Tokyo's subway system]] by [[Aum Shinrikyo]], the Religious Juridical Persons Law was amended in 1996 to provide the government with the authority to supervise certified religious groups. The amended law requires certified religious organizations to disclose their assets to the government and empowers the government to investigate possible violations of regulations governing for-profit activities. Authorities have the right to suspend a religious organization's for-profit activities if they violate these regulations.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
Government policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion. Unlike in previous reporting periods, there were no reports of restrictions on religious freedom. There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.

===Forced religious conversion===
There is a possibility that victims of [[International child abduction in Japan|international abduction]] by a Japanese parent will be raised in a different religious context from those in which the parent(s) report the victim to have been abducted.

[[Human Rights Without Frontiers]] reported a long-standing and persistent trend of abduction and deprivation of religious freedom in Japan for the purpose of religious de-conversions, in which families abduct a loved one who has adopted a faith seen as too extreme, confine them, and pressure them to give up their faith. The organization criticized the inactivity of Japanese police and judicial authorities in investigating and prosecuting this form of domestic violence in which  kidnappings and long-term detentions are organized by family members in cooperation with "[[Exit counseling|exit counselors]]". Victims can suffer from severe psychological problems including [[Post traumatic stress disorder|PTSD (Post traumatic stress disorder)]]. HRWF emphasizes the extreme case of one Toro Goto, [[Unification Church]] member, who was violently abducted and held in isolation for 12 years. Japanese officials are accused of acteing passively and to have failed to investigate and indict his kidnappers. HRWF gives two pages of recommendations to the Japanese authorities and civil society in the conclusion of their report.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Without Frontiers Int’l, [http://www.hrwf.net/images/reports/2012/1231%20report%20final%20eng.pdf Japan, Abduction and Deprivation of Freedom for the Purpose of Religious De-conversion], 2011-11-31, executive summary and conclusion&lt;/ref&gt; HRWF submitted its report at the United Nation's 98th session of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances held 31 October 2012 in Geneva, Switzerland entitled ''Religious Discrimination in Japan''.&lt;ref&gt;
Forum for Religious Freedom Europe , [http://foref-europe.org/2012/10/24/conference-at-the-u-n-in-geneva/ Conference at the U.N. in Geneva], press release&lt;/ref&gt;
[[U.S. State Department]] used the Human Rights Without Frontiers report and in the 2011 annual International Religious Freedom Report to Japan summarized that [[deprogrammer]]s cooperate with family members on abductions of members of different minority religious groups for several years. Although the number of cases decreased in the 1990s, abductions and deprogramming of Unification Church members continue to occur.&lt;ref name="USState2011"&gt;U.S. State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, [https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?dlid=192631 International Religious Freedom Report for 2011, Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other cases===
U.S. State Department in its annual 2011 report mentioned a case of 14 Muslims, who filed a lawsuit against the government, when leaked documents showed, that [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department]] and the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] systematically collected their personal data, religious activities and associations, allegedly because of their religion. Case was still ongoing on end of 2011.&lt;ref name="USState2011" /&gt;

==Societal abuses and discrimination==

'''''Ha'ir''''' ({{Lang-he|העיר}}, lit ''The City'') is a weekly local newspaper published in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. The [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]-sized newspaper was first published in October 1980. Since April 2005 when there was a major shakeup in the business structure of newspaper's publisher, [[Schocken Books|Schocken]] Group, it has been distributed for free.

''Ha'ir'' is published on a Thursday evening, and is distributed throughout the metropolitan area of Tel Aviv through newspaper stands.

One of ''Ha'ir'''s supplements is ''Akhbar Ha'ir'' ({{Lang-he|עכבר העיר}}, lit. ''City Mouse''), a Tel Aviv entertainment guide.

In December 2009, distribution of Ha'ir was stopped to residents of [[Holon]] and [[Petah Tikva]] after research with [[focus group]]s found that residents are not interested in the content that is seen as more relevant to Tel Avivians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?QUID=1055,U1261997378283&amp;did=1000525677|script-title=he:מצמצמים חלוקה: תופסק הפצת עיתון "העיר" בחולון ובפתח-תקווה|author= Lior Aberbach |date= 27 December 2009 |work= |publisher= Globes |accessdate=27 December 2009|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism small}}

'''[[Hinduism]] in the [[Seychelles]]''' is the second largest [[religion]] after [[Christianity]], with more than 2.4% of the population.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/se.html |title=Seychelles|publisher=CIA – The World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu following in [[Seychelles]] has seen an increase in the community with the organization of the Seychelles Hindu Kovil Sangam and the consecration of the Navasakti Vinayagar Temple. The increase in size and popularity of Hinduism caused the Government to declare [[Taippoosam Kavadi]] Festival a holiday.

6% of the population of Seychelles are Ethnic Indians.But only 2.4% are Hindus

==History of Hindus in Seychelles==
In 1901 there were 332 Hindu families out of a population of 19,237 and roughly 3,500 [[Tamil language|Tamil]] speaking people.

The organization of the Seychelles Hindu Kovil Sangam in 1984 and the consecration of the Navasakti Vinayagar Temple in May 1992 were landmarks for the resurgence of Indian cultural activities apart from the religious awakening.&lt;ref name="vijaratnamŚivasupramaniam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.murugan.org/research/seychelles.htm|title=Taippoosam Kavadi Festival in Seychelles|author=Vijaratnam Śivasupramaniam|work=murugan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were over 2,150 Hindus in the [[Seychelles]] as of the 2010 Population and Housing Census,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsb.gov.sc/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Population_and_Housing_Census_2010_Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514112130/http://www.nsb.gov.sc/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Population_and_Housing_Census_2010_Report.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an increase of 500 from the 2002 census. The percentage of Hindus from the 2002 census to the 2010 census increased from 2.1 to 2.4%.

==Seychelles Hindu Kovil Sangam==
The Seychelles Hindu Kovil Sangam, over a short span of seventeen years, has successfully established and entrenched some strong foundations for the preservation, consolidation and further flowering of the [[Hindu culture]]. The ever-popular kavadi festival and special Hindu festivals are covered in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[English language|English]] in the national media and there is a wide coverage of such events over national radio and television.

==Arulmigu Navasakti Vinayagar Temple==
[[File:Thiru Navasakthi Vinayakar Kovil Victoria.jpg]]
Thiru Navasakthi Vinayakar Kovil Victoria

The Arulmigu Navasakti Vinayagar Temple is the first and the only [[Hinduism in Seychelles#Arulmigu Navasakti Vinayagar Temple|Hindu temple in Seychelles]] that has Ganesha as the presiding deity. Since 1999, Ganesha has been elevated to this position. Apart from the presiding deity, icons of Murugan, Nadarajah, Durga, Sreenivasa Perumal, Bhairawa and Chandekeswarar are enshrined in the inner mandapam of the temple. Prayers are performed for the different deities on special occasions.

Taippoosam Kavadi Festival, which began in Seychelles in the inner courtyard of the temple during 1993, is now conducted in the outer courtyard and a chariot kavadi is also taken out in procession. This festival has gained popularity as a national festival, so much so that as from 1998 the government has declared it a holiday for Hindus.&lt;ref name="vijaratnamŚivasupramaniam"/&gt;

'''Hungarian Templeton Program''' is a unique pilot program taking place between 15/09/2015 and 28/02/2017. The main purpose of the program is to develop and support exceptional Hungarian cognitive talents in the 10-29 age group.

==John Templeton Foundation==
[[Sir John Templeton]] (1912-2008) was strongly committed to supporting research in science, theology, philosophy and the social sciences. One of the main goals of his endeavors was to contribute to understanding the fundamental underlying principles of the universe and to building a better society on the ethical, intellectual and spiritual levels. 
He founded the [[John Templeton Foundation]] in 1987, which also includes the [[Templeton World Charity Foundation]]. The TWCF chooses which initiatives it funds and does not accept unsolicited proposals. In accordance with the testamentary provisions of [[Sir John Templeton]] , it supports worthy programs which seek answers to the "big questions" and challenges of life and the universe. As well, it provides assistance to persons with exceptional cognitive talent who contribute to the flourishing of humanity.

==Hungarian Templeton Program==
This program is implemented with the funding and the support of the [[Templeton World Charity Foundation]] and of the [[European Social Fund]] as co-sponsor. The program's advisory partner is the Association of Hungarian Talent Support Organizations ([[:hu:Magyar Tehetségsegítő Szervezetek Szövetsége|Magyar Tehetségsegítő Szervezetek Szövetsége]] - MATEHETSZ).
Launched on September 15, 2015 and lasting until February 28, 2017, the Hungarian Templeton Program is a unique pilot program whose main objective is to develop and support exceptional Hungarian cognitive talents in the 10-29 age group. Using a new methodology specifically designed for this purpose, program staff will identify 300 Hungarian youth with exceptional cognitive talents (Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows) as well as 150 disadvantaged children aged 5–8 with exceptional cognitive talents.

The aim of the program is to bring together a creative community and network of exceptionally talented people whose members will, with the assistance of top-performing contemporary personalities, prepare themselves to take on the momentous task of becoming the leaders, thinkers and entrepreneurs of Hungary and Europe in the decades ahead.

A customized one-year talent support program will be developed for each of the selected talented youth (the Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows). The program also devotes special attention to underprivileged children aged 5–8. It uses a unique talent testing procedure created for this age group, as well as a talent development program consisting of workshop sessions over a period of several days.

The program also offers assistance to talented youth identified during the selection process but not chosen as Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows by offering them access to the ESF "Talents for Hungary" enrichment programs also supported by the Association of Hungarian Talent Support Organizations (MATEHETSZ).

==Selection process==
The 300 Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows are to be selected using objective scientific criteria and a new methodology. Selection will involve tests measuring aptitudes in a number of areas.

===For talented youth aged 10-19===
IQ test, vocabulary, problem solving, working memory, motivation and creativity.

===For talented youth aged 20-29===
IQ test, evaluation of achievements and productivity based on a motivation letter, activities thus far, level of interest and an introductory presentation or video.

==Program framework==
Cognitive talents selected for the program – the Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows – will each benefit from a one-year customized talent support package. Each young person will receive one-on-one mentoring from prominent Hungarian scientists and entrepreneurs who make up the program's roster of mentors. 
Elements of the support program include '''[[e-learning]]; [[coaching]]; [[personality development]]; [[Business networking|networking]]; development of communication, [[linguistic]], computer, [[research]], [[innovation]], financial and entrepreneurial skills; assistance in choosing a career path in a context of [[social responsibility]].'''
 
In addition to supporting skill development in specific areas, the program places especial emphasis on encouraging Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows to use their aptitudes and knowledge responsibly for the '''good of society'''.

==Program content==
Based on their individual needs and the options available in the program, Junior Fellows will receive a personalized talent support package which may include:

* Participation in scientific research and development projects 
* Familiarization with research centers, cases and practices in both scientific and business contexts
* Scholarships
* International travel (competitions, camps, conferences)
* Business trainings (e.g. Lean, Start-up)
* [[LinkedIn]], Everyday Heroes and PREZI trainings
* Public speaking and presentation-making trainings
* Language learning opportunities 
* Familiarization with case studies in a business context
* Soft skill trainings 
* Activities to develop social responsibility
* Drafting business plans, support for start-ups 
* Support for social entrepreneurs (Ashoka) 
* Participation in national and international talent day events 
* Innovation camp

==Post-program opportunities==
This pilot program is for one year, and is expected to continue in [[Hungary]] and serve as a model for expansion into other countries in versions adapted to regional cultural differences. Talented youth selected for the program will be monitored and assisted for a few years after the end of the program by the ongoing network of contacts in the Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellow Network.

==Mentoring==
Substantive support for the Program is provided by our network of mentors: scientists, researchers, experts and businesspeople who have shown exceptional levels of achievement in their fields and careers. Mentoring is a crucial element of the program and a mentor will be assigned to every Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellow.

Like all morning glories the plant entwines itself around structures, growing to a height of {{convert|2|–|3|m}} tall. The leaves are heart-shaped and the stems are covered with brown hairs. The [[flower]]s are trumpet-shaped, predominantly blue to purple or white, and {{convert|3|–|6|cm}} diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitats==
The plant is predisposed to moist and rich [[soil]], but can be found growing in a wide array of soil types.&lt;ref name="Richard H. Uva 1997 Pp. 214-217"&gt;Richard H. Uva, Joseph C. Neal and Joseph M. Ditomaso, ''Weeds of The Northeast'', (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1997), Pp. 214-217.&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] throughout warm temperate and subtropical regions of the world. Although it is often considered a noxious weed, ''Ipomoea purpurea'' is also grown for its beautiful purple and white flowers and has many [[cultivar]]s. Common cultivars include ''I. purpurea'' 'Crimson Rambler' (red-violet blossoms with white throats), 'Grandpa Ott's,' 'Kniola's Black Knight,' and 'Star of Yelta' (blossoms in varying shades of deep purple with white or pale pink throats) and 'Milky Way' (white blossoms with mauve accents).

==Chemistry==
The triangular seeds may have some history of use as a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]; they, like ''[[Ipomoea tricolor]]'' may contain [[Ergine|LSA]].&lt;ref name="Richard H. Uva 1997 Pp. 214-217"/&gt; Effects are reported to be somewhat similar to those of [[LSD]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Savage, Willis W. Harman and James Fadiman, [http://diseyes.lycaeum.org/olo/glory.txt ''Ipomoea purpurea'': A Naturally Occurring Psychedelic]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flower color===
Acylated [[cyanidin]] glycosides can be isolated from violet-blue flowers of ''I. purpurea''. These anthocyanins were all based on cyanidin 3-sophoroside-5-glucoside, acylated with caffeic acid and/or p-coumaric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acylated cyanidin glycosides in the violet-blue flowers of ''Ipomoea purpurea''|author=Norio Saito, Fumi Tatsuzawa, Kyoko Yoda, Masato Yokoi, Kichiji Kasahara, Shigeru Iida, Atsushi Shigihara and Toshio Honda|journal=[[Phytochemistry (journal)|Phytochemistry]]|date=November 1995|volume=40|issue=4|pages=1283–1289|doi=10.1016/0031-9422(95)00369-I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acylated [[pelargonidin]] glycosides can be isolated from the red-purple flowers of ''I. purpurea''. The acylated anthocyanins were all based on pelargonidin 3-sophoroside-5-glucoside, acylated with caffeic acid and/or glucosylcaffeic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acylated pelargonidin glycosides in red-purple flowers of ''Ipomoea purpurea''|author=Norio Saito|author2=Fumi Tatsuzawa|author3=Masato Yokoi|author4=Kichiji Kasahara|author5=Shigeru Iida|author6=Atsushi Shigihara|author7=Toshio Honda|journal=Phytochemistry|date=December 1996|volume=43|issue= 6|pages=1365–1370|doi=10.1016/S0031-9422(96)00501-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxic treatments===
Commercial morning glory seeds are commonly treated with toxic [[methylmercury]] which serves as a preservative and a cumulative neurotoxic poison that is considered useful by some to discourage recreational use of them. There is no legal requirement in the United States to disclose to buyers that seeds have been treated with a toxic heavy metal compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunn Chace |first=Teri |date=2015 |title=Seeing Seeds: A Journey into the World of Seedheads, Pods, and Fruit |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jlfVCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=methylmercury+morning+glory#v=onepage&amp;q=methylmercury%20morning%20glory&amp;f=false |location=Portland OR |publisher=Timber Press |page= |isbn=1604694920 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the book Substances of Abuse, in addition to methylmercury, the seeds are commonly coated with a chemical that cannot be removed with washing that is designed to cause unpleasant physical symptoms such as nausea and abdominal pain. The book states that this chemical is also toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Potter |first=James |date=2008 |title=Substances of Abuse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WU73eJAIDI4C&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=methylmercury+morning+glory |location=Redding CA |publisher=Jubilee Enterprises |page=157 |isbn=1930327463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was educated at the [[City of London School]]. In 1890 he entered the [[Royal Academy School]], where he gained a free medal, and afterward a scholarship in the [[Institution of British Artists]]. He showed his interest in [[Jewish]] matters by his drawings ''A Difficult Passage in the [[Talmud]]'' and ''The Blessing of Sabbath Lights,'' as well as by his ''Early Morning Prayer in the Synagogue.''

His older brother [[Jacob Snowman]] was a London medical doctor and prominent [[mohel]], who circumcised [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and possibly other members of the [[British Royal Family]]. His younger brother was [[Emanuel Snowman]], the jeweller, politician and community leader.&lt;ref name=Palgrave /&gt;

==Career==
In that year, 1897, he formed a group of English Jews known as the [[Maccabaeans]], including [[Israel Zangwill]] and [[Herbert Bentwich]], which undertook a pilgrimage to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the same year. &lt;ref&gt;Palestine Post, 17 March 1947, p. 3; ibid, 27 March 1949, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of his paintings, which were devoted mainly to portraits and domestic views, ''Children's Voices'' (1901) attracted a great deal of attention, and ''The Bride'' (1904) was very popular at the time. He also exhibited a study of ''Sardanapalus,'' as well as ''The Wailing-Place at Jerusalem'' and ''The Proclamation of Joseph as Ruler of Egypt.''

==Personal life==
Isaac Snowman was married to Pearl Alexander at the North London Synagogue on 13 September 1898. According to the report in ''[[The Times]]'' the marriage was never a happy one for the wife owing to the husband's exaggerated views on the subject of "wifely obedience." They lived in [[Algiers]] and [[Hampstead]], and after their son died they adopted a daughter.

In August 1907, Isaac Snowman left for Africa to execute a commission for the King of [[Dahomey]]. Subsequently Pearl filed for divorce on grounds of statutory desertion and adultery, which was granted in June 1909. &lt;ref&gt;The Times, 10 June 1909, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaac meantime continued to build his career. He was commissioned to paint portraits of King George V and Queen Mary, and it was said he was one of the Queen’s favourite artists. 21] Serious artworks enabled him to commission the first house on the now know Hocroft Estate to be built in Ranulf Road off Finchley Road. The house, now number 3, included dedicated artists work space: completed in about 1911, was for many years simply known as ‘The Studio’. Isaac sent five works to the R.A. from this 3 Ranulf Road. This area would have been well known to him, as it was just a few minutes walk from his old home in Fortune Green Road.

Isaac Snowman moved to [[Jerusalem]], where he had a studio over the [[Damascus Gate]]. In the riots that occurred in Jerusalem on 2 November 1921, Snowman encountered a mob and, while trying to make his way through with two friends, was stabbed. &lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Chronicle'', 28 November 1921, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
The outbreak of the [[Second World War]] found Snowman on a visit to England and his failing health prevented him from returning to his home in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine Post'', 17 March 1947, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaac Snowman died peacefully on 11 February 1947, and his funeral was held the following day at Willesden Cemetery. &lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 February 1947, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |History}}

'''Schisms among the Jews''' are cultural as well as religious. They have happened as a product of historical accident, geography, and [[theology]].

==First Temple era==
The biblical narrative describes the split by the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] from the [[Kingdom of Judah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Kin12&amp;version=NASB 1 Kings 12]&lt;/ref&gt; It points to [[Solomon]]'s unfaithfulness to the divine covenant as the reason for the schism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Kin11&amp;version=NASB 1 Kings 11]&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Rehoboam]], Solomon's son, became king, the people requested tax reform. Rehoboam refused. This caused the break. At first, Rehoboam considered a military solution but the prophet [[Shemaiah (prophet)|Shemaiah]] told him not fight because God had caused the schism. [[Jeroboam]], the leader of the tax revolt, became the leader of the Kingdom of Israel.

After the destruction and exile of the Kingdom of Israel by [[Assyria]], non-[[Yahweh|Yahwistic]] practices continued. The narratives of [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]] and others interpreted this as the cause of the failure, destruction, and exile of the Kingdom of Judah by [[Babylonia]]. [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]] had additional reasons for taking over Judah and turning its inhabitants into exiles, including challenging its great rival [[Egypt]].

==Samaritans==
{{Main|Samaritans}}
The Samaritans are an [[ethnoreligious group]] of the [[Levant]] originating from the [[Israelites]] (or [[Hebrews]]) of the [[Ancient Near East]].

Ancestrally, Samaritans claim descent from the [[Tribe of Ephraim]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh]] (two sons of [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]]) as well as from the [[Levite]]s,&lt;ref name=tsu&gt;[http://www.thesamaritanupdate.com/ The Samaritan Update] Retrieved 1 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; who have links to ancient [[Samaria]] from the period of their entry into [[Canaan]], while some [[Orthodox Jews]] suggest that it was from the beginning of the [[Babylonian captivity]] up to the Samaritan polity under the rule of [[Baba Rabba]]. According to Samaritan tradition, the split between them and the [[Judean]]-led Southern Israelites began during the biblical time of the priest [[Eli (biblical figure)|Eli]] when the Southern Israelites split off from the central Israelite tradition, as they perceive it.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Fried|first=Lisbeth S.|title=Ezra and the Law in History and Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQHQBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT148|year=2014|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-61117-410-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They consider themselves to be ''B'nei Yisrael'' ('Children of Israel'), a term used universally by Jewish denominations for the Jewish people as a whole, but do not call themselves ''Yehudim''. The word ''Yehudim'' comes from the [[Hebrew]] word ''Yehudi'' which means from the [[Tribe of Judah]].

==Second Temple period==
{{See also|Second Temple period|Second Temple Judaism}}
Conflicts between [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]] took place in the context of much broader and longstanding social and religious conflicts among Jews, made worse by the Roman conquest.&lt;ref name="Jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/deadsea.html#Essenes|title=History &amp; Overview of the Dead Sea Scrolls|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another conflict was cultural, between those who favored [[Hellenization]] (the Sadducees) and those who resisted it (the Pharisees). A third was juridico-religious, between those who emphasized the importance of the [[Second Temple]] with its [[Cult (religious practice)|rites and services]], and those who emphasized the importance of other [[Mosaic Law]]s. A fourth point of conflict, specifically religious, involved different interpretations of the [[Torah]] and how to apply it to current Jewish life, with Sadducees recognizing only the [[Written Torah]] (with Greek philosophy) and rejecting doctrines such as the [[Oral Torah]], the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], the [[Ketuvim|Writings]], and the [[resurrection of the dead]].

According to [[Josephus]], the Sadducees differed from the Pharisees on a number of doctrinal grounds, notably rejecting ideas of life after death. They appear to have dominated the aristocracy and the temple, but their influence over the wider Jewish population was limited.

The [[Essenes]] preached a reclusive way of life. The [[Zealots]] advocated armed rebellion against any foreign power such as [[Rome]]. All were at violent loggerheads with each other, leading to the confusion and disunity that ended with the destruction of the Second Temple and the sacking of [[Jerusalem]] by Rome.

==Split of early Christianity and Judaism==
[[File:Konrad Witz - Ecclesia und Synagoge.jpg|thumb|[[Ecclesia and Synagoga]] by [[Konrad Witz]] (1400–1447).]]
{{main|Split of early Christianity and Judaism}}
{{See also|New Covenant|Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Christianity and Judaism}}
The first Christians (whom historians refer to as [[Jewish Christians]]) were the original Jewish followers of [[Jesus]], a Galilean preacher and, according to early Christian belief, the resurrected messiah. After his [[Responsibility for the death of Jesus|crucifixion by the Romans]], his followers broke over whether they should [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|continue to observe Jewish law]], such as at the [[Council of Jerusalem]]. Those who argued that the law was abrogated (either partially or fully, either by Jesus or Paul or by the Roman [[destruction of the Temple]]) broke to form Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;This theory regarding the law and the birth of Christianity is not supported by the New Testament book of Acts. In Acts, the law becomes an issue after Christianity is already born by the events of [[Pentecost]]. See Acts 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eventual repudiation of [[Biblical law in Christianity|Moses' Law]] by Jesus' [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] and their [[Divinity of Jesus|belief in his deity]], along with the [[Development of the New Testament canon|development of the New Testament]], ensured that [[Christianity and Judaism]] would become different and often conflicting religions. The [[New Testament]] depicts the Sadducees and Pharisees as Jesus' opponents (see [[Woes of the Pharisees]]), whereas the Jewish perspective has the Pharisees as the justified predecessors of the [[rabbis]] who upheld the [[Torah]] including the [[Oral law]], which Christians refer to as the [[Biblical law in Christianity|Mosaic Law]] or Pentateuch or "[[Old Covenant]]" in contrast to the "[[New Covenant]]".

==Karaite Judaism==
[[File:Караимская кенасса в Киеве 5.jpg|thumb|upright|Karaite [[Kenesa]], [[Kiev]], Ukraine.]]
{{Main|Karaite Judaism}}
Karaite Judaism is a [[Jewish denominations|Jewish denomination]] characterized by reliance on the [[Tanakh]] as the sole source of binding [[halacha|Jewish Law]]. Karaites rejected the rabbinic tenet that an [[Oral Torah]] (oral law) was transmitted to Moses at Mount Sinai along with the [[Tanakh|written scriptures]]. Accordingly, they rejected the central works of [[Rabbinic Judaism]] which claimed to expound and interpret this written law,  including the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]], as authoritative on questions of [[halakha|Jewish law]]. Karaites had a wide following between the 9th and 12th centuries (they claim that at one time they numbered perhaps 10 percent of Jewry), but over the centuries their numbers have dwindled drastically. Today they are a small group, living mostly in [[Israel]]; estimates of the number of Israeli Karaites range from as low as 10,000 to as high as 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_402.html#2209 Judaism, continued...] from [[Adherents.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkiye.net/sota/karaisr.html Karaims of Israel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041209062150/http://www.turkiye.net/sota/karaisr.html |date=2004-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://qumran.com/Karaite%20Information/israels_karaites.htm qumran.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213134433/http://qumran.com/Karaite%20Information/israels_karaites.htm |date=2004-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://qumran.com/Karaite%20Information/karaite_true_believers.htm qumran.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213081126/http://qumran.com/Karaite%20Information/karaite_true_believers.htm |date=2004-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a divergence of views about the historical origins of [[Karaite Judaism]]. Most scholars and some Karaites maintain that it was founded at least in part by [[Anan ben David]], whereas other Karaites believe that they are not the historical disciples of Anan ben David at all, and point out that many of their later sages (such as Ya'acov Al-Kirkisani) argued that most of Anan's teachings were "derived from Rabbanite Lore".

The state of Israel, along with its Chief Rabbinate, ruled that Karaites are Jews, and while critical differences between [[Orthodox Judaism]] and Karaite Judaism exist, American Orthodox rabbis ruled that Karaism is much closer to Orthodoxy than the Conservative and Reform movements, which may ease issues of formal conversion.

==Sabbateans and Frankists==
[[File:Shabbatai2.jpg|thumb|upright|Sabbatai Zevi crowned as the messiah. Amsterdam, 1666.]]
{{Main|Sabbateans|Sabbatai Zevi|Jacob Frank}}
In 1648 [[Sabbatai Zevi|Shabtai Tzvi]] declared himself to be the long-awaited Jewish [[Messiah]] whilst living in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Vast numbers of Jews, known as [[Sabbateans]], believed him; but when under pain of a death sentence in front of the Turkish [[sultan]] [[Mehmed IV]] he became an [[apostasy|apostate]] from Judaism by becoming a [[Muslim]], his movement crumbled. Nevertheless, for centuries, small groups of Jews believed in him, and the [[rabbi]]s were always on guard against any manifestations of this schism, always suspicious of hidden ''"Shebselach"'' (Yiddish for "little Sabbatians", a play on the word for "young dumb sheep"). Indeed, when the movement of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]] began attracting many followers, the rabbis were once again suspicious that this was Sabbatianism in different garb. It would take many centuries to sort out these complex divisions and schisms and see where they were headed.

After his mysterious death somewhere in the area of Turkish [[Albania]], groups of Jews continued to be clandestine followers of Shabtai Tzvi even though they had outwardly converted to [[Islam]], these Jews being known as the [[Donmeh]]. Jewish converts to Islam were, at times, therefore regarded with great suspicion by their fellow Muslims.

A few decades after Shabtai's death, a man by the name of [[Jacob Frank]] claiming mystical powers preached that he was Shabtai Tzvi's successor. He attracted a following, preached against the [[Talmud]], advocated a form of licentious worship, and was condemned by the rabbis at the time. When confronted by the [[Poland|Polish]] authorities, he converted to [[Catholicism]] in 1759 in the presence of [[August III the Saxon|King Augustus III of Poland]], together with groups of his Jewish followers, known as "Frankists". To the alarm of his opponents, he was received  by reigning European monarchs who were anxious to see their Jewish subjects abandon Judaism and [[apostasy|apostacise]]. The Frankists eventually joined the Polish nobility and gentry.

==Hasidim and Mitnagdim==

{{hatnote|Note: While the name "Hasidim" has gained popular and positive approval, the name "Mitnagdim" has fallen out of popular usage and may even be regarded as offensive by some.}}
[[File:Vilna Gaon portrait.gif|thumb|upright|Rabbi Elijah ben Shlomo Zalman, the [[Vilna Gaon]], leader of the ''[[Mitnagdim]]'']]
[[File:Schneur Zalman of Liadi.jpg|thumb|upright|Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], founder of [[Chabad-Lubavitch]]]]

The arrival of Israel ben Eliezer (1698–1760), known as the ''[[Baal Shem Tov]]'' ('Master [of the] Good Name'), on the scene of Jewish history in [[Eastern Europe]] would herald the commencement of a sea change in what is known today as [[Haredi Judaism]]. Even though he did not write books, he succeeded in gaining powerful disciples to his teachings that were based on the earlier expositions of Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]] (1534–1572) who had based much of his [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] teachings on the [[Zohar]]. The Baal Shem Tov came at a time when the Jewish masses of Eastern Europe were reeling in bewilderment and disappointment engendered by the two notorious Jewish [[false messiah]]s [[Sabbatai Zevi]] (1626–1676) and [[Jacob Frank]] (1726–1791) in particular.

The Baal Shem Tov witnessed Frank's public [[apostasy]] (''shmad'' in Hebrew) to [[Christianity]],{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} which compounded Zevi's earlier apostasy to Islam. The Baal Shem Tov was thus determined to encourage his influential disciples (talmidim) to launch a spiritual revolution in Jewish life in order to reinvigorate the Jewish masses' connections with [[Torah Judaism]] and to vigorously motivate them to bind themselves to the joyous observance of the [[613 mitzvot|commandments]], [[Jewish services|worship]], [[Torah study]], and sincere belief in [[Names of God in Judaism|God]], so that the lures of Christianity and Islam, and the appeal of the rising [[Secularity|secular]] [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], to the Jewish masses would be weakened and halted. To a large degree Israel succeeded in Eastern Europe.

Already during his lifetime, and gaining momentum following his death, the Baal Shem Tov's disciples spread out to teach his mystical creeds all over Eastern Europe. Thus was born [[Hasidic Judaism]] (Hasidism). Some of the main movements were in: [[Russia]] which saw the rise of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] movement; [[Poland]] which had the [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Gerrer Hasidim]]; [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] had [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobov]]; [[Hungary]] had [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar Hasidim]]; and [[Ukraine]] had the [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslovers]], and many others that grew rapidly gaining literally millions of adherents, until it became the dominant brand of Judaism in Eastern Europe in the century following the Baal Shem Tov's death. The Jewish masses flocked to this new inspired brand of mystical Judaism, and retained their connections to their Jewish heritage and way of life.

Only when this new religious movement reached [[Lithuania]] did it meet its first stiff resistance at the hands of the [[Lithuanian Jews]] (also known as ''Litvaks''). It was Rabbi Elijah ben Shlomo Zalman (~1720–1797), known as the [[Vilna Gaon]] ('Genius [of] [[Vilna]]'), and those who followed his classic stringent [[Talmud]]ic and [[Halakha|Halakhic]] scholasticism, who put up the fiercest resistance to the Hasidim ('righteous [ones]'). They were called ''[[Mitnagdim]]'', meaning '[those who are] opposed [to the Hasidim]'.

The ''Vilna Gaon'', who was himself steeped in both [[Talmud]]ic and [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] wisdom, analyzed the theological underpinnings of this new "[[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]" and in his view, concluded that it was deeply flawed since it had elements of what may be roughly termed as [[panentheism]] and perhaps even outright [[pantheism]], dangerous aspirations for bringing the [[Jewish Messiah]] that could easily be twisted in unpredictable directions for Jewry as had previously happened with the Zevi and Frank religious "revival" fiascos, and an array of complex rejections of their religious ideology. The ''Vilna Gaon''{{'}}s'views were later formulated by his chief disciple Rabbi [[Chaim Volozhin]] (1741–1821) in his work ''[[Nefesh HaChaim]]''. The new Hasidic leaders countered with their own religious counter-arguments, some of which can be found in the ''[[Tanya]]'' of Chabad-Lubavitch. Much of the debate remains obscure.

However, regardless of the unpopularity of the move,{{explanation needed|date=February 2017}} the ''Vilna Gaon'' and the scholars of the [[beth din]] (Jewish religious court) of Vilna went so far as to place at least one severe [[Herem (censure)|cherem]] upon the Hasidim, officially "excommunicating" them from Judaism, which they in turn copied and did likewise to the Mitnagdim. The ''Vilna Gaon''{{'}}s strongest opposition was to the founder of Chabad-Lubavitch, Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] (1745–1812).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Physical fights broke out in Vilna with each side trying to gain the favor of the Russian authorities and declaring the other side to be beyond the pale of Judaism.

The bitterness and animosity between the two camps ran deep, and basically whoever joined one wing, did not attend or pray in the same [[synagogue]]s as the other wing, nor have the same Torah teachers, and they would generally not marry into each other's families, which is still more or less the rule today where there is a high degree of internal communal structure.

Little of the split between Hasidim and Mitnagdim remains within the modern Haredi world. When confronted by mutual threats, such as from the secular Jews of the [[Haskalah]], or by the onslaught of [[Communism]] and [[the Holocaust]], or faced by secular [[Zionism|Zionists]], Hasidim and Mitnagdim do work together. When the outside world does not threaten them, their battle of ideas resumes as an intellectual debate. Each group has its own unique method of [[yeshiva]] study and communal life, no matter where they establish themselves. They tend to live in different neighborhoods that are still within commuting distance, although even these differences are quickly disappearing.

In modern-day [[Israel]] Hasidim support the [[Agudat Israel]] party in the [[Knesset]] (Israel's parliament) and the non-Hasidic Mitnagdim support the [[Degel HaTorah]] party, led by Rabbi [[Aharon Yehuda Leib Shteinman]] in [[Bnei Brak]]. Agudat Israel and Degel Torah have formed a political alliance. There is also another large community that follows the rabbinical teachings of the [[Edah Charedis]]. These include the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar Hasidim]] and the ''perushim'' communities which do not support any groups that participate in the Israeli government or state activities, including elections.

==Orthodox versus Reform (and Conservative), East versus West==
{{Main|Relationships between Jewish religious movements}}
From the time of the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, and the growth of [[Liberalism]], added to the political and personal freedoms granted by [[Napoleon]] to the Jews of Europe, many Jews chose to abandon the foreboding and isolating [[ghetto]]s and enter into general society. This influenced the internal conflicts about religion, culture, and politics of the Jews to this day.

Some Jews in [[West Europe|Western Europe]], and many Jews in [[United States|America]], joined the religiously liberal new [[Reform Judaism]] movement, which drew inspiration from the writings of modernist thinkers like [[Moses Mendelson]]. They coined the name "Orthodox" to describe those who opposed the "Reform". They were criticized  by the [[Orthodox Judaism]] rabbis, such as [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] in Germany, and condemned, particularly by those known today as followers of Haredi Judaism, based mainly in Eastern Europe. (Later on, in 1880s America, [[Conservative Judaism]] split from the Reform movement.)

Thus a cultural [[schism (religion)|schism]] was also created between the more westernised [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]]-speaking [[Western Europe]]an Jews and their more religiously observant [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] speaking Eastern European brethren whom they denigratingly labeled ''Ost Yidden'' ("Eastern Jews"). These schisms and the debates surrounding them, continue with much ferocity in all Jewish communities today as the Reform and Orthodox movements continue to confront each other over a wide range of religious, social, political and ethnic issues. (Today, the largest Jewish communities are in Israel and in the [[United States]], and the geographical separation has resulted in cultural differences, such as a tendency to identify as [[hiloni]] and [[haredi]] in Israel, as opposed to, say, Reform and Orthodox in the United States.)

'''Jihadist extremism in the United States''' (or '''Islamist extremism in the United States''') refers to Islamic extremism occurring within the United States. [[Islamic extremism]] is adherence to a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam (see [[Islamic fundamentalism]]), potentially including the promotion of violence to achieve political goals (see [[Jihadism]]). In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terror attacks]], Islamic extremism became a prioritized national security concern of the United States government and a focus by many subsidiary security and law enforcement entities. Initially, the focus of concern was on foreign terrorist groups, particularly [[al-Qaeda]], but in the course of the years since 9/11 the focus has shifted more towards Islamic extremism ''within'' the United States.&lt;ref name='Hamilton Test'&gt;{{cite news | first = Lee | last = Hamilton | title = The Attacks of September 11th: Where We Are Today | date = 2011-09-08 | url = http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Hamilton%20Testimony.pdf | work = U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security | page = 3 | accessdate = 2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of American citizens or long-term residents involved in extremist activity is small, but nevertheless is a national security concern.&lt;ref name='Bipartisan'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Assessing the Terrorist Threat: A Report of the Bipartisan Policy Center's National Security Preparedness Group | journal = Bipartisan Policy Center | date = 2010-09-10 | first = Peter | last = Bergen |author2=Bruce Hoffman| id = | url = http://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/NSPG%20Final%20Threat%20Assessment.pdf | format = PDF | page = 30 | accessdate = 2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeyno Baran, senior fellow and director of the Center for Eurasian Policy at the Hudson Institute, argues a more appropriate term is ''[[Islamism|Islami''st'']] extremism'' to distinguish the religion from the political ideology that leads to extremism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Islam, the religion, deals with piety, ethics, and beliefs, and can be compatible with secular liberal democracy and basic civil liberties. Islamists, however, believe Islam is the only basis for the legal and political system that governs the world's economic, social, and judicial mechanisms. Islamic law, or sharia, must shape all aspects of human society, from politics and education to history, science, the arts, and more. It is diametrically opposed to liberal democracy.&lt;ref name="Baran" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
With the value placed on freedom of religion in the United States, religious extremism is a difficult and divisive topic. [[Zuhdi Jasser|Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser]], president and founder of the [[American Islamic Forum for Democracy]], testified before Congress that the United States is "polarized on its perceptions of Muslims and the radicalization that occurs within our communities... One camp refuses to believe any Muslim could be radicalized living in blind multiculturalism, apologetics, and denial, and the other camp believes all devout Muslims and the faith of Islam are radicalized..."&lt;ref name='Jasser Test'&gt;{{cite news | first = M. Zuhdi | last = Jasser | title = The Extent of Radicalization in the American Muslim Community and the Community's Response | date = 2011-03-10 | url = http://homeland.house.gov/sites/homeland.house.gov/files/Zuhdi%20Jasser%20FINAL.pdf | work = House Hearing | accessdate = 2011-11-10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110520185620/http://homeland.house.gov/sites/homeland.house.gov/files/Zuhdi%20Jasser%20FINAL.pdf# | archive-date = 2011-05-20 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In between the two polarities is a respect for the religion of Islam coupled with an awareness of the danger "of a dangerous internal theo-political domestic and global ideology that must be confronted – Islamism."&lt;ref name='Jasser Test' /&gt;

==Non-violent Islamic extremism==
{{POV section|date=April 2013}}
An important element to understanding Islamic extremism in the United States is the number of religious non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with either alleged or proven ties to [[Islamism|Islamist]] groups abroad. These groups do not promote violence or terrorism, but propagate an extremist message that can lead others to violence. Zeyno Baran testified before the Senate Committee for Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs that "over the course of four decades, Islamists have taken over the leadership in almost all Islam related areas in America."&lt;ref name='Baran'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/download/071008baran | title = The Roots of Violent Islamist Extremism and Efforts to Counter It | accessdate = 2011-11-11 | last = Baran | first = Zeyno | date = 2008-07-10 | format = PDF | work = Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that any American, Muslim or not, seeking information about Islam will be influenced by an extremist ideology, often unknowingly.&lt;ref name="Baran" /&gt; An international Islamist organization, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], founded many of the Islamic organizations in the United States;&lt;ref name='Brotherhood'&gt;{{cite news | first = Steven | last = Merley | title = The Muslim Brotherhood in the United States | date = 2009-04-03 | url = http://www.currenttrends.org/docLib/20090411_Merley.USBROTHERHOOD.pdf | work = Hudson Institute | accessdate = 2011-11-10 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111011182523/http://www.currenttrends.org/docLib/20090411_Merley.USBROTHERHOOD.pdf | archivedate = 2011-10-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Brotherhood does not engage in terrorism directly, but is part of the "vanguard of a radical Islamist ideology" that can lead followers to violence.&lt;ref name="Baran" /&gt; Also, the Saudi Arabian government has spent tens of billions promoting [[Wahhabism]] globally and some of that money has supported mosques and Islamic organizations in the United States.&lt;ref name='Jasser Test' /&gt;

==Violent Islamic extremism==
"The single biggest change in terrorism over the past several year has been the wave of Americans joining the fight – not just as foot soldiers but as key members of Islamist groups and as operatives inside terrorist organizations, including al-Qaeda."&lt;ref name='Temple Terror'&gt;{{cite news | first = Dina | last = Temple-Raston | title = Terror Made in America | date = 2010-10-11 | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story/php?storyId=130439513 | work = NPR | accessdate = 2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; American citizens or longtime residents are "masterminds, propagandists, enablers, and media strategists" in foreign terror groups and working to spread extremist ideology in the West.&lt;ref name='Temple Terror' /&gt; This trend is worrisome because these American extremists "understand the United States better than the United States understands them."&lt;ref name='Temple Terror' /&gt;

===Americans in Radical Islamic terrorist organizations===
Since 2007, over 50 American citizens and permanent residents have been arrested or charged in connection with attempts to join terrorist groups abroad, including al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Al Shabaab.&lt;ref name="ADL: Arrest Underscores"&gt;{{cite web|first=http://blog.adl.org/extremism/california-arrest-nguyen-ghannoum-americans-joining-al-qaeda-abroad|title=California Arrest Underscores Ongoing Concern Over Americans Joining Al Qaeda Abroad|work=Access ADL|publisher=Anti-Defamation League}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 alone, 9 Americans are known to have joined or attempted to join foreign terrorist organizations.&lt;ref name="ADL: Arrest Underscores"/&gt;  Americans inside [[al-Qaeda]] provide insider's knowledge of the United States. [[Adam Gadahn]] was an American convert who joined al-Qaeda in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name='Temple 4th'&gt;{{cite news | first = Dina | last = Temple-Raston | title = Two Americans Become Al-Qaida Media Strategists | date = 2010-10-14 | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130543554 | work = NPR | accessdate = 2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He released English-language propaganda videos, but Gadahn lacked charisma and his voice was replaced by [[Anwar al-Awlaki]]. Awlaki was an American of Yemeni descent, killed on September 30, 2011 by a U.S. missile strike in Yemen.&lt;ref name='NYT Anwar' /&gt; Awlaki had religious credentials Gadahn lacks and a "gently persuasive" style; "tens of thousands, maybe millions, have watched [Awlaki's] lectures on the Internet."&lt;ref name='Temple 4th' /&gt; His perfect English and style broadened al-Qaeda's reach. Another key American in al-Qaeda's power structure was a man named [[Adnan Shukrijumah]]. Shukrijumah is believed to be the highest ranking American in al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name='Temple 1st'&gt;{{cite news | first = Dina | last = Temple-Raston | title = Al-Qaida Mastermind Rose Using American Hustle | date = 2010-10-11 | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story/php?storyId=130434651&amp;ps=rs | work = NPR | accessdate = 2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in Saudi Arabia, grew up in Trinidad, and moved to Florida as a teenager; he was a naturalized American citizen and left the United States in the spring of 2001.&lt;ref name='Temple 1st' /&gt; Shukrijumah was a mystery to authorities until he was identified by [[Najibullah Zazi]] after Zazi was arrested for a failed plot to bomb transportation targets around New York City.&lt;ref name='Temple 1st' /&gt; Zazi had traveled to Afghanistan to fight U.S. forces, but Shukrijumah convinced Zazi to return to the United States and plan an attack here.&lt;ref name='Temple 1st' /&gt; In May 2014, Florida born convert Mohammed Abusalha conducted a deadly suicide bombing while fighting for Islamist extremists in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/us/suicide-bomber-from-us-came-home-before-attack.html?_r=0|website=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Troy Kastigar and Douglas McAuthur McCain, two Americas who converted to [[Islam]] traveled to [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|the Islamic State]] for jihad and were killed in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/for-Jihad-recruits-a-pipeline-from-Minnesota-to-militancy.html?src=me&amp;module=Ribbon&amp;version=origin&amp;region=Header&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=Most%20Emailed&amp;pgtype=article |title=For Jihad Recruits, a Pipeline From Minnesota to Militancy |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 6, 2014 |accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 [[Zulfi Hoxha]] traveled to Syria where he became a significant figure in [[ISIS]].&lt;ref name="AtlanticISIS"&gt;{{cite news|title=A New American Leader Rises in ISIS|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/01/isis-america-hoxha/550508/|accessdate=18 January 2018|publisher=The Atlantic|date=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Places for radicalization==

===Prison===
{{see also|Conversion to Islam in U.S. prisons}}
The United States has [[United States incarceration rate|the world's largest prison population]] and "prisons have long been places where extremist ideology and calls to violence could find a willing ear, and conditions are often conducive to radicalization."&lt;ref name='Shadows'&gt;{{cite news|title=Out of the Shadows: Getting Ahead of Prisoner Radicalization |year=2006 |url=http://www.gwumc.edu/hspi/policy/PrisonerRadicalization.pdf |work=The George Washington University Homeland Security Policy Institute |accessdate=2011-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530030840/http://www.gwumc.edu/hspi/policy/PrisonerRadicalization.pdf |archivedate=May 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most inmates have little exposure to mainstream Islam and are vulnerable to extremist versions of the religion.&lt;ref name='Shadows' /&gt; Islamic extremism is facilitated by "an inadequate number of Muslim religious service providers,"&lt;ref name='Shadows' /&gt; leading to a reliance on volunteers, contractors, or inmates to provide religious services. Testifying before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Donald Van Duyn said the following on Islamic extremism in U.S. prisons:&lt;blockquote&gt;Prison radicalization primarily occurs through anti-US sermons provided by contract, volunteer, or staff Imams, radicalized inmates who gain religious influence, and extremist media. Ideologies that radicalized inmates appear most often to embrace or are influenced by the [[Salafi]] form of [[Sunni Islam]] (including revisionist versions commonly known as “prison Islam”) and an extremist view of [[Shia Islam]] similar to that of the Government of Iran and Lebanese Hizballah.&lt;ref name='Duyn'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hsgac.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&amp;FileStore_id=bba49f1b-4881-423d-8054-4b9dd78bd5d4- | title = Prison Radicalization: The Environment, the Threat, and the Response | accessdate = 2011-11-11 | last = Van Duyn | first = Donald | date = 2006-09-19 | format = PDF | work = Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs }}{{Dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Prison" or "Jailhouse Islam" is unique to prison and incorporates values of gang loyalty and violence into the religion.&lt;ref name='Shadows' /&gt; The prison system's limited resources prevent adequate monitoring of religious services to ensure an extremist message is not being spread and also hinders sufficient screening of inmates, volunteers, and contractors providing the services.&lt;ref name='Shadows' /&gt;

Members of a prison extremist group, called Jami'iy yat Ul-Isla Is Saheeh (JIS), from New Folsom State Prison in California hatched a plot to attack numerous local government and Jewish targets.&lt;ref name='Shadows' /&gt; In July 2005, members of JIS "were involved in almost a dozen armed gas station robberies in Los Angeles with the goal of financing terrorist operations."&lt;ref name='Duyn' /&gt; The plot was exposed and there is debate over whether the group is a sign of a wider problem. There is a "significant lack of social science research" on the issue of Islamic extremism in U.S. prisons&lt;ref name='Shadows' /&gt; and there is disagreement on the danger Islamic extremism in prisons poses to U.S. national security.&lt;ref name='Prison Rad'&gt;{{cite news | first = Bert | last = Useem |author2=Obie Clayton | title = Radicalization of U.S. Prisoners | date = 2009-09-25 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9133.2009.00574.x/pdf | work = Criminlogy and Public Policy | accessdate = 2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics are not kept on the religious orientation of inmates in the U.S. prison system, limiting the ability to adequately judge the potential for Islamic extremism. A report published by the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General in 2004 on the issue of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]' selection of Muslim chaplains, estimated that 6% of the federal inmate population seek Muslim Islamic services.&lt;ref name='DOJ Prison'&gt;{{cite news | first = Office of the Inspector General | title = A Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Selection of Muslim Religious Services Providers | date = April 2004 | url = http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/0404/final.pdf | work = Department of Justice | accessdate = 2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through prisoner self-reporting, the majority of Muslims in federal prison are Sunni or Nation of Islam followers.&lt;ref name='DOJ Prison' /&gt; The federal prison population is only a small percentage of the total U.S. prison population, however, and cannot provide an overall representation of Muslims inmates in the United States.

===Mosques===
Some [[mosque]]s in the United States transmit extremist ideas.&lt;ref name='Jasser Test' /&gt; The [[North American Islamic Trust]] (NAIT), a group with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, "holds titles of approximately 300 properties [mosques and Islamic schools]".&lt;ref name="About NAIT"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nait.net/NAIT_about_%20us.htm | title = About NAIT | accessdate = 2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization's website states: "NAIT does not administer these institutions or interfere in their daily management, but is available to support and advise them regarding their operation in conformity with the Shari'ah."&lt;ref name="About NAIT"/&gt; Other research on the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States claims NAIT influences a far larger number of Islamic institutions in the U.S.&lt;ref name='Baran' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Brotherhood' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Shaykh'&gt;{{cite news | first = Shaykh Muhammad | last = Hisham Kabbani | title = Islamic Extremism: A Viable Threat to U.S. National Security | date = 1999-01-07 | url = http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.org/media-center/domestic-extremism/63-islamic-extremism-a-viable-threat-to-us-national-security.html | work = Open Forum at U.S. Department of State | accessdate = 2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no government policy on the establishment of mosques in the United States and no way to monitor activity.&lt;ref name='Shaykh' /&gt; The value placed on religious freedom in the U.S. complicates the situation as mosques are places of worship that may be used to spread extremist ideology.

===Internet===
{{further|Terrorism and social media}}
The internet can be used as a “facilitator—even an accelerant—for terrorist and criminal activity."&lt;ref name='Mueller' /&gt; The increase of online English-language extremist material in recent years is readily available with guidance to plan violent activity.&lt;ref name='Leiter' /&gt; “English-language web forums […] foster a sense of community and further indoctrinate new recruits”.&lt;ref name='Olsen'&gt;{{cite news | first = Matthew G. | last = Olsen | title = Ten Years After 9/11: Are We Safer? | date = 2011-09-13 | url = http://www.dni.gov/testimonies/20110913_testimonies_olsen.pdf | work = Hearing Before Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs | accessdate = 2011-11-10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111015011000/http://dni.gov/testimonies/20110913_testimonies_olsen.pdf# | archive-date = 2011-10-15 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet has “become a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, and for terrorist recruiting, training, and planning. It is a means of social networking for like-minded extremists...including those who are not yet radicalized, but who may become so through the anonymity of cyberspace."&lt;ref name='Mueller' /&gt;

[[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP) published an English-language online magazine called ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]''. The magazine is designed to appeal to Westerners. It is “[w]ritten in colloquial English, [with] jazzy headlines and articles that made it seem almost mainstream—except that they were all about terrorism.”&lt;ref name='Temple 2nd'&gt;{{cite news | first = Dina | last = Temple-Raston | title = American Editor Brings U.S. Savvy to Jihad Outreach | date = 2010-10-12 | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story/php?storyId=130439697&amp;ps=rs | work = NPR | accessdate = 2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Inspire'' “included tips for aspiring extremists on bomb-making, traveling overseas, email encryption, and a list of individuals to assassinate."&lt;ref name='Leiter'&gt;{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Leiter | title = Nine Years After 9/11: Confronting the Terrorist Threat to the Homeland | date = 2010-09-22 | url = http://www.nctc.gov/press_room/speeches/2010-09-22D-NCTC-Leiter-Testimony-SHSGAC-Hearing.pdf | work = Testimony before Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs | accessdate = 2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor is believed to be [[Samir Khan]], an American citizen, based on work he did before leaving the United States.&lt;ref name='Temple 2nd' /&gt; The magazine appeared six months after Khan arrived in Yemen.&lt;ref name='Temple 2nd' /&gt; There have been seven issues of ''Inspire''.&lt;ref name='Inspire'&gt;{{cite news | first = Thomas | last = Joscelyn | title = AQAP Releases 7th Edition of Inspire | date = 2011-09-27 | url = http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2011/09/aqap_releases_sevent.php | work = The Long War Journal | accessdate = 2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan died in the same missile attack that killed [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] and the future of the magazine is unknown.&lt;ref name='NYT Anwar'&gt;{{cite news | first = Mark | last = Mazzetti |author2=Eric Schmitt |author3=Robert F.

Yousef al-Khattab and Younes Abdullah Mohammed, both converts to Islam, started a group called [[Revolution Muslim]]. The group was meant “to be both a radical Islamic organization and a movement” with goals that include “establishing Islamic law in the United States, destroying Israel and taking al-Qaeda’s messages to the masses.”&lt;ref name='Temple 3rd'&gt;{{cite news | first = Dina | last = Temple-Raston | title = 'Revolution Muslim' a Gateway for Would-Be Jihadis | date = 2010-10-13 | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story/php?storyId=130519592&amp;ps=rs | work = NPR | accessdate = 2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of its members “reads like a who’s who of American [[homegrown terrorism]] suspects”; Samir Khan and [[Colleen LaRose|Jihad Jane]] were regulars in the Revolution Muslim chat rooms.&lt;ref name='Temple 3rd' /&gt; Revolution Muslim had a website and a YouTube account before it was shut down after a posting glorifying the stabbing of a British member of Parliament.&lt;ref name='End of MR'&gt;{{cite news | title = Announcement from IslamPolicy.com – on transfer from RevolutionMuslim | date = 2010-11-16 | url = http://www.islampolicy.com/2010/11/announcement-from-islampolicycom-on.html | work = Islam Policy website | accessdate = 2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolutionmuslim.com domain now redirects to a website called Islam Policy run by Younes Abdullah Mohammed.&lt;ref name='End of MR' /&gt; The danger of the website, and others that offer similar content, is the websites offer the chance to become further involved in [[violent extremism]] and connect to like-minded people in the U.S. and aboard.&lt;ref name='Temple 3rd' /&gt;

==U.S.-specific extremist narrative==
Key to the trend of increasing Islamic extremism in the United States “has been the development of a US-specific narrative that motivates individuals to violence.”&lt;ref name='Leiter' /&gt; “This narrative—a blend of al-Qa‘ida inspiration, perceived victimization, and glorification of past plotting—has become increasingly accessible through the Internet, and English-language websites are tailored to address the unique concerns of US-based extremists.”&lt;ref name='Leiter' /&gt; “To disaffected, aggrieved, or troubled individuals, this narrative explains in a simple framework the ills around them and the geopolitical discord they see on their television sets and on the Internet.” &lt;ref name='Zarate'&gt;{{cite news | first = Juan | last = Zarate | title = Al Qa'ida in 2010: How Should the U.S. Respond? | date = 2010-01-27 | url = http://csis.org/files/ts_100127_Zarate.pdf | work = Testimony before House Armed Services Committee | accessdate = 2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative is easy to understand and grants “meaning and heroic outlet” for the discontented and alienated.&lt;ref name='Zarate' /&gt;

==U.S. government response==
The President, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), and the [[National Counterterrorism Center]] (NCTC) are the most relevant elements of the U.S. government to the threat of American Islamic extremism and each has taken steps to address and counter the issue. Since [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] the government has worked to improve information sharing "within the government, and between federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement, as well as with the public."&lt;ref name='Olsen' /&gt; The "If You See Something, Say Something" campaign, instituted by DHS and local law enforcement, was created to raise public awareness of the potential dangers.&lt;ref name='Napolitano' /&gt; In August 2011, the Office of the President released a strategy to counter violent extremism called [[Empowering local partners to prevent violent extremism in the United States|''Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States'']].&lt;ref name='President'&gt;{{cite news | title = Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States |date=August 2011| url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/empowering_local_partners.pdf | work = Office of President of the United States | accessdate = 2011-11-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111111164048/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/empowering_local_partners.pdf | archivedate = 2011-11-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy takes a three-pronged approach of community engagement, better training, and counternarratives. The plan states: "We must actively and aggressively counter the range of ideologies violent extremists employ to radicalize and recruit individuals by challenging justifications for violence and by actively promoting the unifying and inclusive visions of our American ideals," challenging extremist propaganda through words and deeds.&lt;ref name='President' /&gt; The goal is to "prevent violent extremists and their supporters from inspiring, radicalizing, financing, or recruiting individuals or groups in the United States to commit acts of violence."&lt;ref name='President' /&gt;

==American Muslim community response==
There are Muslim Americans speaking out against Islamic extremist activities, although the most common complaint is Muslim leaders do not speak out forcefully against Radical Jihad.&lt;ref name='Jasser Test' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Shaykh' /&gt;  An important voice is Dr. [[Zuhdi Jasser]], the president of the [[American Islamic Forum for Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aifdemocracy.org/ | title = American Islamic Forum for Democracy | accessdate = 2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Jasser testified before a [[Peter T. King#Radicalization hearings|House hearing on Muslim radicalization in the U.S.]] in early 2010:&lt;blockquote&gt; For me it is a very personal mission to leave my American Muslim children a legacy that their faith is based in the unalienable right to liberty and to teach them that the principles that founded America do not contradict their faith but strengthen it. Our founding principle is that I as a Muslim am able to best practice my faith in a society like the United States that guarantees the rights of every individual blind to faith with no governmental intermediary stepping between the individual and the creator to interpret the will of God. Because of this, our mission is to advocate for the principles of the Constitution of the United States of America, liberty and freedom and the separation of mosque and state. We believe that this mission from within the “House of Islam” is the only way to inoculate Muslim youth and young adults against radicalization. The “Liberty narrative” is the only effective counter to the “Islamist narrative."&lt;ref name='Jasser Test' /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another voice, that warned of Islamic extremism before the [[September 11 attacks]] is [[Hisham Kabbani|Shaykh Muhammad Hisham Kabbani]], chairman of the Islamic Supreme Council of America.&lt;ref name='Shaykh' /&gt;

Louvre, MR825.]]

The '''Kanephoros''' ({{lang-grc|Κανηφόρος}} (pl. {{lang|grc|Κανηφόροι}} ''Kanephoroi''), latinate plural form '''Canephorae''', "Basket Bearer(s)")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Canephorae}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an honorific office given to unmarried young women in [[ancient Greece]], which involved the privilege of leading the procession to sacrifice at festivals; the highest honour was to lead the ''pompe'' (''πομπή'') at the [[Panathenaic Festival]]. The role was given to a virgin selected from amongst the aristocratic or [[Eupatrid]] families of Athens whose purity and youth was thought essential to ensure a successful sacrifice. Her task was to carry a basket or ''kanoun'' (''κανοῦν''), which contained the offering of barley or first fruits, the sacrificial knife and fillets to decorate the bull,&lt;ref&gt;L. Deubner, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics II'', 1909, pp. 433&amp;ndash;35.&lt;/ref&gt; in procession through the city up to the altar on the acropolis.

From [[Aristophanes]]’s ''[[Lysistrata]]'' we have evidence that the office of kanephoros was the last in a sequence of religious duties that an unmarried Athenian girl might undertake; first as an ''[[arrephoros|arrhephoros]]'', later an ''aletris'', then as an ''arktos'' (''ἄρκτος'').&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes, ''Lys.'' 641&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage continues, “[f]inally, when I had grown to be a beautiful girl, I was a kanephoros and wore a necklace of dried figs.&lt;ref&gt;Translation by C. Levine in N. Loraux, ''The Children of Athena'', 1993, p. 167, spoken by the chorus of women to Stratyllis.&lt;/ref&gt;” Though the precise age of the kanephoros is not known this suggests the girl was probably between 11 and 15. In such a conspicuous and ritually important office the chosen girl was expected to have a blameless reputation: in 514 BCE the unnamed sister of [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton|Harmodios]] was rebuffed as kanephoros in the Greater Panathenaia; this insult is cited as the cause of her brother’s later assassination of the tyrant Hipparchos which hastened the fall from power of the [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratid]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides 656.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Aristotle AP 18"&gt;Aristotle ''Ath. Pol.'' 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Lavelle 1986 318-31"&gt;BM Lavelle ''The Nature of Hipparchos' Insult to Harmondios'', AJP107, 1986, pp. 318&amp;ndash;31.&lt;/ref&gt; The cult practice of bearing the basket in a sacrificial procession may date back to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] period; however, the Athenian usage seems to belong to the beginnings of the Panathenaia. The role is also referred to in myth with the abduction of Oreithyia by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]. A girl who acted as kanephoros would have advertised the central place of her family in Athenian society, and her own availability for a dynastic marriage.

The depiction of the kanephoros in art presents an interesting problem.  Unlike the [[ephebos]] there are few representations of such girls, possibly because of the restriction on mentioning the name of honourable women in ancient Greek society.&lt;ref&gt;M. Golden ''Names and Naming at Athens:Three Studies'', CV 30, 1986, pp. 245&amp;ndash;69.&lt;/ref&gt; Excluding the [[Parthenon]] there are only some 44 images of girls and karoun in the period 550 to 330 BCE. Otherwise she must be identified by her dress since while serving her office the kanephoros wore a distinctive full-length mantle, for example in the [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] by [[Makron (vase painter)|Makron]], Toledo, Ohio 1972.55. On the [[Parthenon Frieze]] none of the maidens (who may be identified by their long hair) are depicted carrying the ''kanoun'' and all of them wear the festival mantle, however Linda Jones Roccos suggests that the maidens wearing both peplos and mantle implies they are kanephoroi, which would be consistent with the evidence of contemporary vase painting and wedding iconography.&lt;ref&gt;L. J. Roccos, ''The Kanephoros and her Festival Mantle in Greek Art'' 1995, pp. 654&amp;ndash;59.&lt;/ref&gt; This would solve the problem of the curious absence of the basket bearers from the processional frieze.

The kanephoros was not exclusive to the Panathenaia or to Athens, she may be found at a number of festival across the Greek world, including: the Country Dionysia of Attica; Mother of the Gods in Athens, and Apollo Pythais, Artemis Brauronia, Asklepios; Demeter and Isis at Eleusis; Zeus Disoterien in Piraeus; Zeus Basileus in Lebadeia; Argive Hera; Xphrodite; Hermes at Salamis; Hekate on Delos; Sarapis and Isis; Herakles; Heros Iatros; Neoptolemos. [[Arsinoe II]] is mentioned as kanephoros on the [[Rosetta stone]].

[[Image:KanishkaBuddhaDetail2.JPG|thumb|Detail of the Buddha, surrounded by [[cherubs]], with devotee or [[bodhisattava]]]]
The '''Kanishka casket''' or '''Kanishka reliquary''', is a [[Buddhist]] [[reliquary]] made in gilded copper, and dated to the first year of the reign of the [[Kushan]] emperor [[Kanishka]], in 127 CE.  It is now in the [[Peshawar Museum]] in the historic city of Peshawar, Pakistan. 

==History and description==
It was discovered in a deposit chamber under the monumental [[Kanishka stupa]] (described by Chinese pilgrims in the 7th century as the tallest stupa in all India), during the archeological excavations in 1908-1909 in Shah-ji-Dheri on the outskirts of [[Peshawar]]. It is said to have contained three bone fragments of the Buddha,&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, D. B. (1908-9): "Excavations at Shāh-ji-Dherī." ''Archaeological Survey of India'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; which were forwarded to [[Burma]] by the British following the excavation,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, John H. (1909): "Archaeological Exploration in India, 1908-9." (Section on: "The stūpa of Kanishka and relics of the Buddha"). ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'', 1909, pp. 1056-1061.&lt;/ref&gt; where they still remain.

The casket is today at the [[Peshawar Museum]], and a copy is in the [[British Museum]]. The casket is dedicated in [[Kharoshthi]]. The inscription reads:

: "(*mahara)jasa kanishkasa kanishka-pure nagare aya gadha-karae deya-dharme sarva-satvana hita-suhartha bhavatu mahasenasa sagharaki dasa agisala nava-karmi ana*kanishkasa vihare mahasenasa sangharame"

:"In the acceptance (i.e. for the acceptance) of the Sarvāstivādin teachers, this perfume box is the meritorious gift of Mahārāja Kanishka [ . . . ''jasa Kani''] in the city of Kanishkapura [''Kanishkapure nagare'']. May (it) be for the welfare and happiness of all beings. . . . ''sa'', the superintendent of construction of the refectory in Kanishka's vihāra [''nashkasa vihare''], in Mahāsena's saṁghārāma [''Mahasenasa saṁgharame'']." &lt;ref&gt;Translated by B. N. Mukherjee. ''BMQ'', Vol. XXVIII, pp. 41-43. Quoted in: Dobbins, K. Walton. (1971): ''The Stūpa and Vihāra of Kanishka I''. The Asiatic Society of Bengal Monograph Series, Vol. XVIII. Calcutta.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally it was believed, that the text is signed by the maker, a Greek artist named ''Agesilas'', who oversaw work at Kanishka's [[stupa]]s (caitya), confirming the direct involvement of Greeks with Buddhist realizations at such a late date: "The servant ([[dasa]]) Agisalaos, the superintendent of works at the vihara of Kanishka in the monastery of Mahasena" ("dasa agisala nava-karmi ana*kaniskasa vihara mahasenasa sangharame"). However, a recent cleaning of the casket had shown that the old reading was not accurate. Instead, the name is to be read ''agnisala'', which is the [[refectory]] of the monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Prudence R. Myer: ''Again the Kanishka Casket'', In: ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 48, No. 3/4 (Sep.–Dec., 1966), pp. 396–403 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3048396]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lid of the casket shows the Buddha on lotus pedestal, and worshipped by [[Brahma]] and [[Indra]].

The edge of the lid is decorated by a frieze of flying geese, or [[Hamsa bird|hamsa]], symbolizing the travel of departing souls and the removal from [[samsara]]. Some of the geese have a wreath of victory in their beak.

The body of the casket represents a Kushan monarch, probably Kanishka in person, with the Iranian [[Sun god]] and [[Moon god]] at his side. On the sides are two images of a seated Buddha, worshiped a royal figures, possibly a [[bodhisattava]].

A garland, supported by [[cherubs]] goes around the scene in typical Hellenistic style.

The relics themselves were forwarded to Burma by the British in 1910 in order to safeguard them. They are today visible in [[Mandalay]]. The three fragments of bone are believed to be true relics of Gautama Buddha.

'''Kittur Chennamma''' (23 October 1778{{snd}}21 February 1829)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/printrelease.aspx?relid=148944|title=Rani Chennamma of Kitturu|website=pib.nic.in|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Rani]] of [[Kittur]], a former [[princely state]] in [[Karnataka]]. She led an armed rebellion against the [[British East India Company]] in 1824 in defiance of the [[doctrine of lapse]] in an attempt to maintain Indian control over the region, but was defeated and died imprisoned. One of the first female rulers to rebel against British rule, she has become a folk hero in Karnataka and symbol of the independence movement in India.

==Early life==
Kittur Chennamma was born on 23 October 1778, in Kakati, a small village in the present [[Belagavi District]] of Karnataka, India. She belonged to the Lingayat community and received training in horse riding, sword fighting and archery from a young age. 

She married Raja Mallasarja of the Desai family at the age of 15. 

==Rebellion against the British==
Chennamma’s husband died in 1824, leaving her with a son and a state full of volatility. This was followed by her son’s death in 1824.  Rani Chennamma was left with the state of Kittur and an uphill task to save it from the British. Following the death of her husband and son, Rani Chennamma adopted Shivalingappa in the year 1824 and made him the heir to the throne. This irked the East India Company, who ordered Shivalingappa’s expulsion, on the pretext of the Doctrine of Lapse introduced by Lord Dalhousie, the then Governor General, to annex independent Indian States in 1848. This doctrine was based on the idea that in case the ruler of an independent state died childless, the right of ruling the State reverted or ‘lapsed’ to the sovereign. The state of Kittur came under the administration of Dharwad collectorate in charge of [[St John Thackeray]] of which Mr. Chaplin was the commissioner, both of whom did not recognize the new ruler and regent and notified Kittur to accept the British regime. 

Rani Chennamma sent a letter to [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], Lieutenant-Governor of the [[Bombay Presidency]] pleading her cause, but the request was turned down, and war broke out.&lt;ref name=south&gt;{{cite book|last=Gopalakrishnan|first=Subramanian (Ed.)|title=The South Indian rebellions : before and after 1800|year=2007|publisher=Palaniappa Brothers|location=Chennai|isbn=9788183795005|pages=102–103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i81mLhBEBgQC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=Kittur+Rani+Chennamma&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=71GaUP3ANcrLrQeA24DQBg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=1st|author2=Gopalakrishnan, edited by S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British tried to confiscate the treasure and jewels of Kittur, valued at around 1.5 million rupees.&lt;ref name=jewels&gt;{{cite book|title=Disturbances at Kittur and the death of Mr. Thackeray|year=1825|publisher=Parbury, Allen, and Company,|location=London|pages=474–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CYYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA474&amp;dq=St+John+Thackeray+collector&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lta1UI_mBJG3rAersoHQAg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=St%20John%20Thackeray%20collector&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They attacked with a force of 20,797 men and 437 guns, mainly from the third troop of Madras Native Horse Artillery.&lt;ref name=attack&gt;{{cite book|last=Asiatic Journal Vol.3|title=The Occurrences at Kittur in 1824|year=1830|publisher=Parbury, Allen, and Co|location=London|pages=218–222|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7hELAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=St+John+Thackeray+collector&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L7a1UJSKOLCZmQWQtYC4BA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=St%20John%20Thackeray%20collector&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2168">'''Langalbandh''' ({{lang-bn|লাঙ্গলবন্দ}}, literally, ''the place where the plough stopped''), is a village in [[Bangladesh]], and a place considered holy by Hindus. It is located in [[Bandar Upazila]] of [[Narayanganj District]], on the bank of the [[Brahmaputra River]] near the [[Dhaka]]-[[Chittagong]] highway.

The annual religious bathing ritual in Langalbandh draws thousands of Hindu devotees from Bangladesh and also neighboring [[India]] and [[Nepal]].

==The 2015 stampede==
During the annual mela falling on 27 March over 1.5 million devotees thronged Langalbandh for the ritual bathing.&lt;ref name="bdnews24"&gt;{{cite news |last=Palash |first=Mojibul Haque |date=27 March 2015 |title=10 die in stampede during Hindu religious gathering in Narayanganj |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2015/03/27/10-die-in-stampede-during-hindu-religious-gathering-in-nganj |newspaper=bdnews24.com |accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten Hindu devotees were killed and 30 others were injured in a stampede during the 'Astami snan', the Hindu holy bathing ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=10 killed in Langalbandh Astami Snan stampede|url=http://www.theindependentbd.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=252643:10-killed-in-langalbandh-astami-snan-stampede&amp;catid=129:frontpage&amp;Itemid=121|accessdate=28 March 2015|publisher=The Independent|date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpectedly large crowd and the lack of proper preparedness of the authorities are said to have contributed to the fatalities in the stampede.&lt;ref name="bdnews24" /&gt;

:Appears in the Bible at: [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 4–5

The [[Book of Jubilees]] provides names for a host of otherwise unnamed biblical characters, including wives for most of the [[antediluvian]] [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]]. The last of these is [[Noah]]'s wife, to whom it gives the name of ''Emzara''. Other Jewish traditional sources contain many different names for Noah's wife.

The Book of Jubilees says that Awan was [[Adam and Eve]]'s first daughter. Their second daughter Azura married [[Seth]].

For many of the early wives in the series, ''Jubilees'' notes that the patriarchs married their sisters.

The ''[[Cave of Treasures]]'' and the earlier ''Kitab al-Magall'' (part of [[Clementine literature]]) name entirely different women as the wives of the patriarchs, with considerable variations among the extant copies.

The Muslim historian [[Ibn Ishaq]] (c. 750), as cited in [[al-Tabari]] (c. 915), provides names for these wives which are generally similar to those in ''Jubilees'', but he makes them [[Cainites]] rather than [[Sethianism|Sethites]], despite clearly stating elsewhere that none of Noah's ancestors were descended from Cain.

Daughter of [[Lamech (descendant of Cain)|Lamech]] and Zillah and sister of [[Tubal-cain]] (Gen. iv. 22). According to Abba ben Kahana, Naamah was Noah's wife and was called "Naamah" (pleasant) because her conduct was pleasing to God. But the majority of the rabbis reject this statement, declaring that Naamah was an idolatrous woman who sang "pleasant" songs to idols.

A large body of legend has attached itself to Nimrod, whose brief mention in ''Genesis'' merely makes him "a mighty hunter in the face of the [[Tetragrammaton|Lord]]". (The Biblical account makes no mention of a wife at all.)  These legends usually make Nimrod to be a sinister figure, and they reach their peak in Hislop's ''The Two Babylons'', which make Nimrod and Semiramis to be the original authors of every false and [[paganism|pagan]] religion.

The [[Deuterocanonical books]], sometimes called the "[[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]]", are considered canonical by Catholics, [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Oriental Orthodox]] (though these churches' lists of books differ slightly from each other).

=== The woman with seven sons ===
The [[woman with seven sons]] is a Jewish [[martyr]] who is unnamed in [[2 Maccabees]] 7, but is named Hannah, Miriam, Shamuna and Solomonia in other sources. According to Eastern Orthodox tradition, her sons, the "Holy Maccabean Martyrs" (not to be confused with the martyrs in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian]] book of [[Meqabyan]]), are named Abim, Antonius, Gurias, Eleazar, Eusebonus, Alimus and Marcellus.

=== The seven Archangels ===

The Gospel does not state that there were, in fact, three magi or when exactly they visited Jesus, only that multiple magi brought three gifts: gold, [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]].  Nevertheless, the number of magi is usually extrapolated from the number of gifts, and the [[three wise men]] are a staple of Christian [[nativity scene]]s.  While the European names have enjoyed the most publicity, other faith traditions have different versions. According to the ''Armenisches Kindheitsevangelium'', the three magi were brothers and kings, namely Balthasar, king of India; Melqon, king of [[Persia]]; and Gaspar, king of [[Arabia]]. The [[Christianity in China#Christianity in the contemporary PRC|Chinese Christian Church]]{{clarify|reason=Which one?|date=May 2013}} believes that the [[astronomer]] [[Liu Shang]] was one of the wise men.

The [[Massacre of the Innocents]] was the infanticide of all young male children in the vicinity of Bethlehem ordered by [[Herod the Great]] so as to avoid the loss of his throne to a newborn King of the Jews whose birth had been announced to him by the [[Magi]].

''Dives'' is simply [[Latin]] for "rich", and as such may not count as a proper name. The story of the blessed [[Lazarus and Dives|Lazarus]] and the [[Damnation#Religious|damned]] rich man is widely recognised under the title of ''Dives and Lazarus'', which may have resulted in this word being taken for a proper name.

A long-standing Western Christian tradition first attested by [[Pope Gregory I]] identifies the woman taken in [[adultery]] with Mary Magdalene, and also with [[Mary of Bethany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/site/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2008-12-10_110304839.html Italians find 'Jesus' foot salve'], 10 Dec 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Jesus had [[exorcism|exorcised]] seven [[demons]] out of Mary Magdalene ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|16:9|KJV}}), and Mary Magdalene appears prominently in the several accounts of Jesus' entombment and resurrection, but there is no indication in the Bible that clearly states that Mary Magdalene was the same person as the adulteress forgiven by Jesus.  

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] has never identified Mary Magdalene as either the woman taken in adultery, or the sinful woman who anointed Jesus' feet.

During the [[trial of Jesus]] the wife of [[Pontius Pilate]] sent a message to him saying, "Have nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."

The proposed names of Procla and Procula may not be names at all, but simply a form of Pilate's official title of [[Procurator (Roman)|Procurator]], indicating that she was the Procurator's wife.

'''Luís Vaz de Camões''' ({{IPA-pt|luˈiʒ ˈvaʒ dɨ kaˈmõjʃ}}; sometimes rendered in [[English language|English]] as '''Camoens''' or '''Camoëns''', e.g. by [[Lord Byron|Byron]] in ''[[English Bards and Scotch Reviewers]]'', {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|m|_|oʊ|ˌ|ən|z}}; c. 1524 or 1525 – 10 June 1580) is considered [[Portugal]]'s and the Portuguese language's greatest [[poet]]. His mastery of verse has been compared to that of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Joost van den Vondel|Vondel]], [[Homer]], [[Virgil]] and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]. He wrote a considerable amount of lyrical poetry and drama but is best remembered for his epic work ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'' (''The Lusiads''). His collection of poetry ''The Parnasum of Luís de Camões'' was lost in his lifetime. The influence of his masterpiece ''Os Lusíadas'' is so profound that Portuguese is sometimes called the "language of Camões".

==Background==
Many details concerning the life of Camões remain unknown, but he is thought to have been born around 1524. Luís Vaz de Camões was the only child of [[Camões Family|Simão Vaz de Camões]] and wife Ana de Sá de Macedo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=64622 |title=Luís Vaz de Camões |publisher=GeneAll.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; His birthplace is unknown. [[Lisbon]], [[Coimbra]] or [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]] are frequently presented as his birthplace, although the latter is based on a disputable interpretation of one of his poems. [[Constância]] is also considered a possibility as his place of birth: a statue of him can be found in the town.

Camões belonged to a family originating from the northern Portuguese region of [[Chaves (Portugal)|Chaves]] near [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. At an early age, his father Simão Vaz left his family to pursue personal riches in [[Portuguese India|India]], only to die in [[Goa]] in the following years.  His mother later remarried.

[[File:EstatuaCamoesLisboa.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Monument to Luís de Camões, [[Lisbon]]]]
Camões lived a semi-privileged life and was educated by [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. For a period, due to his familial relations he attended the [[University of Coimbra]], although records do not show him registered (he participated in courses in the Humanities). His uncle, Bento de Camões, is credited with this education, owing to his position as Prior at the [[Monastery of Santa Cruz]] and Chancellor at the University of Coimbra.

He frequently had access to exclusive literature, including classical Greek, Roman and Latin works;  he read Latin and Italian, and wrote poetry in Spanish.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[File:Jerónimos April 2014-2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Camões' tomb in the [[Jerónimos Monastery]], [[Belém, Lisbon]]]]
Camões, as his love of poetry can attest, was a romantic and idealist. It was rumored that he fell in love with Catherine of Ataíde, lady-in-waiting to the Queen, and also [[Maria of Portugal, Duchess of Viseu|Princess Maria]], sister of [[John III of Portugal]]. It is also likely that an indiscreet allusion to the king in his play ''El-Rei Seleuco'', as well as these other incidents, may have played a part in his exile from Lisbon in 1548. He traveled to the [[Ribatejo Province|Ribatejo]] where he stayed in the company of friends who sheltered and fed him. He stayed in the province for about six months.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He enlisted in the overseas militia, and traveled to [[Ceuta]] in the fall of 1549. During a battle with the [[Moors]], he lost the sight in his right eye. He returned to Lisbon in 1551, a changed man, living a bohemian lifestyle. In 1552, during the religious festival of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]], in the [[Rossio|Largo do Rossio]], he injured Gonçalo Borges, a member of the Royal Stables. Camões was imprisoned. His mother pleaded for his release, visiting royal ministers and the Borges family for a pardon. Released, Camões was ordered to pay 4,000 [[Portuguese real|réis]] and serve three years in the militia in the Orient.

He departed in 1553 for Goa on board the ''São Bento'', commanded by Fernão Alves Cabral. The ship arrived six months later. In Goa, Camões was imprisoned for debt. He found Goa "a stepmother to all honest men", and he studied local customs and mastered the local geography and history. On his first expedition, he joined a battle along the [[Malabar Coast]]. The battle was followed by skirmishes along the trading routes between [[Egypt]] and India. The fleet eventually returned to Goa by November 1554. During his time ashore, he continued his writing publicly, as well as writing correspondence for the uneducated men of the fleet.
[[File:Luís de Camões statue Havana.jpg|thumb|222x222px|A statue commemorating de Camões in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]]]
At the end of his obligatory service, he was given the position of chief warrant officer in [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]]. He was charged with managing the properties of missing and deceased soldiers in the Orient. During this time he worked on his epic poem ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'' ("The Lusiads") in a grotto. 
He was later accused of misappropriations and traveled to Goa to respond to the accusations of the tribunal. During his return journey, near the [[Mekong River]] along the [[Cambodia]]n coast, he was shipwrecked, saving his manuscript but losing his Chinese lover, Dinamene. His shipwreck survival in the Mekong Delta was enhanced by the legendary detail that he succeeded in swimming ashore while holding aloft the manuscript of his still-unfinished epic.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1570 Camões finally made it back to Lisbon, where two years later he published ''Os Lusíadas'', for which he was considered one of the most prominent Iberian poets at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Aguiar e Silva (2011, "Cânone literário português e Camões (O)"). Historian [[Pero de Magalhães Gândavo]] wrote in 1574 that "time will never triumph over Camões's fame" (''idem, ibidem'')&lt;/ref&gt; In recompense for this poem or perhaps for services in the Far East, he was granted a small royal pension (15000 réis) by the young and ill-fated [[Sebastian of Portugal|King Sebastian]] (ruled 1557–1578).

In 1578 he heard of the appalling defeat of the [[Battle of Alcácer Quibir]], where King Sebastian was killed and the Portuguese army destroyed. The Castilian troops were approaching Lisbon{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} when Camões wrote to the Captain General of Lamego: "All will see that so dear to me was my country that I was content to die not only in it but with it". 
Camões died in Lisbon in 1580, at the age of 56. The day of his death, 10 June [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar|OS]], is [[Portugal Day|Portugal's national day]].  
He is buried near [[Vasco da Gama]] in the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] in the parish of [[Santa Maria de Belém (Lisbon)|Belém]] in Lisbon.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Monkey tree, Jurong West, The New Paper, Sep 07.jpg|thumb|240px|right|The discovery of an outline of [[monkey]]s on a callused tree trunk in [[Jurong West New Town]] has initiated a minor [[social mania]] in [[Singapore]], drawing large crowds to the tree. {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
The '''monkey tree phenomenon''' is a [[social phenomenon]] in [[Singapore]], which began in September 2007. It arose from the discovery of a [[callus]] on a [[tree]] in [[Hong Kah]], which appears [[monkey]]-like.  Some believe the image to be of divine origin, while others have attributed the phenomenon to the effects of [[pareidolia]], whereby random stimuli are perceived as meaningful. The callus has initiated a minor [[social mania]], drawing large crowds to look or pray at the tree.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The phenomenon started on 12 September 2007 when an unknown person put up a sign in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] on a tree on Jurong West Street 42. The sign read that a monkey had come to the tree three years ago to look for his father, the Monkey God. It added that a recent [[car accident]] had split the old [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of the tree open, releasing the Monkey God. One resident purported that the monkey image appeared around 3 September 2007.&lt;ref name="Ng Hui Hui"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,141806,00.html| author = Ng Hui Hui| title = Monkey See, Monkey Do?| publisher = ''[[The New Paper]]''| date = 13 September 2007| pages = 12, 13| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014083330/http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,141806,00.html| archivedate = 14 October 2007| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Straits Times 13 September 2007"&gt;{{cite news | author = | title = Monkey Mania | publisher = ''[[The Straits Times]]'' | date = 13 September 2007| page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of the sign and the monkey outline on the tree trunk were reported in the local [[English language|English]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]-language [[List of newspapers in Singapore|newspaper]]s such as ''[[The New Paper]]'', ''[[The Straits Times]]'' and ''[[Lianhe Zaobao]]''. Reports also quoted residents claiming how three car accidents had earlier happened at the spot, but none had been fatal, purportedly due to the tree's "magical" properties.

Since news broke on 13 September 2007, hundreds of people from all over Singapore have flocked to the usually quiet [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] neighbourhood to pay [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the tree. By the afternoon of 13 September, the crowd visiting the tree had swelled to more than 30, with [[Votive offering|offerings]] occupying the grass patch surrounding the tree.&lt;ref name="Ng Hui Hui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mypaper 17 September 2007"&gt;{{cite news | author = | title = Public "impatient" to see "Monkey tree" | publisher = ''[[mypaper]]'' | date = 17 September 2007| page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monkey outline===
The tree with the monkey outline is a species of the [[Khaya|African Mahogany]]. It is a common tree planted by the [[National Parks Board]] (NParks) to provide [[shade (shadow)|shade]], particularly in [[park]]s and along major roads and [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]]. It is a hardy tree that grows well under most soil conditions.

On the trunk of the tree in question is an outline of two monkeys &amp;mdash; one larger than the other &amp;mdash; with limbs, faces and bodies. They were formed on a surface that is smoother and of a slightly lighter colour than the rest of the trunk. Some people claimed to see three monkeys.

NParks gave a plausible explanation for how the monkey outline could have been formed: The tree was involved in several minor accidents over the years. The uneven bark surface at the base of the tree trunk was the result of callusing, a natural reaction in which the tree grows new bark over injured areas.

The department of [[biological science]]s at the [[National University of Singapore]] explained that patterns formed by callusing are random and depend on the damage caused by the accidents. It added that the monkey outline on the smoother bark may disappear with time as the new [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] layers form under it and push this layer out. Subsequently, the smooth surface would get darker and rougher, like the rest of the tree bark.

===Public mania===
Devotees to the tree believed that the images are either a manifestation of [[Sun Wukong]], a [[deity]] from [[Chinese mythology]], or [[Hanuman]], the monkey deity in the [[Hindu pantheon]], and that praying to them would bring them luck.&lt;ref name="Zaihan Mohamed Yusof"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,141903,00.html | author = Zaihan Mohamed Yusof| title = So Noisy We Cannot Sleep | publisher = ''[[The New Paper]]'' | date = 14 September 2007| pages=10, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crowd has been leaving bunches of [[banana]]s, packets of [[peanut]]s, [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]s and [[chrysanthemum]] flowers, burning [[joss stick]]s, and praying for lucky [[4-Digits|4-D]] numbers at the tree. People also started burning [[incense]] paper, prompting a resident to place a [[zinc]] barrel beside the tree so that the ashes could be scooped into the barrel.&lt;ref name="Ng Hui Hui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Straits Times 13 September 2007"/&gt; Some residents even won a bet on the 4-D draw held on 12 September. The winning number "4309" was obtained by combining the HDB block number near the tree (430) and the order of the [[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]] in the [[Chinese zodiac]] (ninth).

There were volunteers who helped to distribute the bananas and peanuts to people who drop by. Some of them have also put up signs telling people not to leave [[red packet]]s filled with money beneath the tree. A visitor had left a [[tin can]] containing tiny rolls of paper at the tree.&lt;ref name="Ng Hui Hui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zaihan Mohamed Yusof"/&gt;

Thousands of people have since visited the ''tree'', and the crowd grew to over 200 at one point on the afternoon of 14 September. The crowd consisted of both men and women, mostly [[Chinese in Singapore|Chinese]] and [[Indians in Singapore|Indians]] of all ages. The people wanted a peek of the monkey images, while many took pictures of the tree with their [[mobile phone]]s. Images of the monkey tree were even sold at [[S$]]3 or S$10 a photograph near the tree.&lt;ref name="Zaihan Mohamed Yusof"/&gt;

The crowds were so large that residents started complaining of the noise, [[littering]] and [[traffic jam]]s caused by vehicles parked illegally along the narrow road. This prompted the [[Singapore Police Force|police]] to patrol the area.&lt;ref name="mypaper 17 September 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zaihan Mohamed Yusof"/&gt;

Two nearby trees also started garnering offerings from 14 September &amp;mdash; one for a supposed outline of [[Guan Yin]], the [[Goddess of Mercy]], on its trunk, and another whose bark resembles the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] elephant god [[Ganesha]].&lt;ref name="Zaihan Mohamed Yusof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Straits Times 15 September 2007"&gt;{{cite news | author = | title = Elephantine frenzy at Jurong | publisher = ''[[The Straits Times]]'' | date = 15 September 2007| page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological explanations==
Many experts interviewed by ''The Straits Times'' thought that the phenomenon could be a case of "believing is seeing".

A [[sociologist]] from the National University of Singapore explained that "those who believe in divine objects are mostly those who follow a simple faith which is founded in tangible evidences of the sacred". He referred to the believers who, in May 2006, flocked to the mountains of [[Mexico]]'s southern [[Chiapas]] state where a rock with an image that resembles [[Jesus Christ]] was discovered.

Another sociologist pointed out that "these objects are called [[Fetishism|fetish]]es or 'objects that are imbued with deep symbolic significance to become sacred objects that embody gods and spirits'." In the monkey tree's case, it was because of a "natural transformation of its material appearance that reminds people of an important legend", and "this form of [[worship]] is actually basic to human religious behaviour".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1904">In [[demonology]], '''Morax''' is a Demon, Great Earl, and President of [[Hell]], having thirty (thirty-two, according to other authors) legions of [[demon]]s under his command. He teaches [[Astronomy]] and all other liberal sciences, and gives good and wise [[Familiar spirit|familiars]] that know the virtues of all herbs and precious stones. This profile of the demon can be seen in Pseudomonarchia Daemonum (Johann Weyer, 1577) as well as in Goetia (S.L. MacGregor Mathers, 1904).

He is depicted both as a man with the head of a bull, as well as a bull with the head of a man.

It has been proposed that Morax is related to the Minotaur which Dante places in Hell (''Inferno'', Canto xii). See Fred Gettings, Dictionary of Demons (1988)

His name seems to come from [[Latin]] 'morax', that delays, that [[wiktionary:Stops|stops]].

''Other spellings'': Foraii, Marax, Farax.

'''Mormon literature''' is generally considered to have begun a few years before the March 1830 publication of the [[Book of Mormon]]. Since then, Mormon literature has grown to include more [[Standard Works|scripture]], as well as [[Latter Day Saint historians|histories]], [[LDS fiction|fiction]], biographies, [[LDS Poetry|poetry]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints hymns|hymns]], drama and other forms.

==Roman temple==
There are the ruins of a [[Roman temple]] in the village that is included in a group of [[Temples of Mount Hermon]]. It is larger than the one at [[Hebbariye]], measuring {{convert|72|ft|m}} long (from east to west) and {{convert|35|ft|m}} wide (from north to south). It faces east with a commanding aspect towards [[Mount Hermon]].&lt;ref name="ROBINSON1856"/&gt; It was noted that the view ''"of Hermon from this point is imposing beyond the power of language to express"''.&lt;ref name="Wilson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Wilson|title=Picturesque Palestiine, Sinai and Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C1ZIbwAACAAJ|accessdate=19 September 2012|date=3 June 2010|publisher=Sophia Perennis et Universalis|isbn=978-1-59731-459-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Taylor noted that the doorway of the temple was at least thirty degrees offset from the peak.&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Taylor|title=The Roman temples of Lebanon: a pictorial guide.

It feature an elegant [[pediment]] with graceful architecture. Only the northern wall remains standing with [[pilaster]]s in the northeast corner. The east entrance featured {{convert|3|ft|m}} thick columns that possibly formed a [[portico]].&lt;ref name="ROBINSON1856"/&gt; At the west end of the temple is an [[altar]] with stairs leading down to an underground chamber or crypt that runs for the length of the temple.&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"/&gt; Thirteen courses of stones were recorded by Robinson to a height of {{convert|43.5|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="ROBINSON1856"/&gt;

The site was suggested to have been used by the [[Druze]] as a [[shrine]] to a [[prophet]] called '''Safa''', who was descended from [[Jacob]] and whose people lived towards [[Hebron]] and [[Jerusalem]]. Little record of the prophet Safa remains, although it was said that "The honourable body is there, and the spirit is always to be found there. Any day that a man seeks him he will find him, it depends on his faith."&lt;ref name="Curtiss2005"/&gt;

'''Peik Chin Myaung''' is a [[limestone]] [[stalactite]] cave situated south of Wetwun village, near [[Pyin Oo Lwin]], [[Myanmar]]. The cave is an interest site of tourism just 23&amp;nbsp;km from Pyin Oo Lwin, on the [[Lashio]] road.

==History==

The cave was firstly developed by local Nepalese or [[Gakhars|Gakhar]] and later co-opted by the Myanmar government as a tourist attraction in 1990 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mon-photo.com/Asia/Burma_2/pages/Peik_Chin_Myaung_Cave_1_jpg.htm/|title=Peik Chin Myaung Cave|author=Peik Chin Myaung}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The cave covers an area of 45 acre, where local plants named Peik Chin, alike long pepper vine used to grow by the mouth of the cave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ladyphyu.multiply.com/photos/album/239/Peik-chin-myaung_Maha_Nandamu_Cave_at_Pyin-oo-lwinMyanmar?&amp;show_interstitial=1&amp;u=%2Fphotos%2Falbum/| title=Peik Chin Myaung Cave photo album}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrtv3.net.mm/pages/polwin.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its history estimated to be 230 millions and 310 millions years old from the formation of limestone and hillocks.
After established to enshrine with many Buddhist stupas inside the cave, it also being called Maha Nadamu cave. Despite the imaginable enshrine room to the pilgrimage, the access down to the cave, which leads with a road around 3&amp;nbsp;km off from Wutwun village, was a tumble countryside road not actually comfortable to access by taxis.

==Local interest==

The local people and many Myanmar pilgrims enjoyed having a good swim at the entrance of the cave. The swallow water flows and cascade from the 600m deep cave. In turns, many locals from Pyin Oo Lwin develop shops with some local products such as wine and dried meat (satt tar chuak) and souvenirs to suit for visitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmtimes.com/no424/n016.htm/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}
'''Prior''', derived from the [[Latin]] for "earlier, first", (or '''prioress''' for nuns) is an [[ecclesiastic]]al [[title]] for a  [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]], usually lower in rank than an [[abbot]] or [[abbess]]. Its earlier generic usage referred to any monastic superior.

==Monastic superiors==
In the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], the term appears several times, referring to any superior, whether an abbot, [[Provost (religion)|provost]], [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]], etc. In other old monastic rules the term is used in the same generic sense.

With the [[Cluniac Reforms]], the term ''prior'' received a specific meaning; it supplanted the provost or dean (''praepositus''), spoken of in the Rule of St. Benedict. The example of the Cluniac congregations was gradually followed by all Benedictine monasteries, as well as by the [[Camaldolese]], [[Vallombrosians]], [[Cistercians]], [[Hirsau Abbey|Hirsau congregations]], and other offshoots of the Benedictine Order.

Monastic congregations of [[hermit]] origin generally do not use the title of abbot for the head of any of their houses, in an effort to avoid the involvement with the world the office of an abbot would entail. As a result, it is not in use for the congregation as a whole. Among them, the equivalent term of '''prior general''' is the one used. This applies, e.g., for the [[Camaldolese]] and the [[Carthusians]].

The term is also used by various [[mendicant order]]s, e.g., the [[Carmelites]] and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]. This applies both to the friars and the nuns of these orders. The term connotes the idea that the '''prior general''' is simply the "first among equals".&lt;ref name="carmfri"&gt;Admin (2017-07-05). Carmelite Friars. The British Province of Carmelites, 5 July 2017. Retrieved on 2018-06-08 from http://www.carmelite.org/family/friars.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compound and derived titles===
The [[Benedictine Order]] and its branches, the [[Premonstratensian Order]], and the military orders have three kinds of priors:
*the claustral prior
*the conventual prior
*the obedientiary prior

The '''Claustral prior''' (Latin ''prior claustralis''), called [[dean (religion)|dean]] in a few monasteries, holds the first place after the [[abbot]] (or [[Grand master (order)|grand-master]] in military orders), whom he assists in the government of the monastery, functioning effectively as the abbot's second-in-charge. He has no ordinary jurisdiction by virtue of his office, since he performs the duties of his office entirely according to the will and under the direction of the abbot. His jurisdiction is, therefore, a delegated one and extends just as far as the abbot desires, or the constitutions of the congregation prescribe. He is appointed by the abbot, generally after a consultation in chapter with the professed monks of the monastery, and may be removed by him at any time.

{{anchor|Sub-prior}} &lt;!-- from Sub-prior --&gt;
In many monasteries, especially larger ones, the claustral prior is assisted by a '''sub-prior''', who holds the third place in the monastery. In former times there were in larger monasteries, besides the prior and the sub-prior, also a third, fourth and sometimes even a fifth prior. Each of these was called circa (or ''circator''), because it was his duty to make the rounds of the monastery to see whether anything was amiss and whether the brethren were intent on the work allotted to them respectively. He had no authority to correct or punish the brethren, but was to report to the claustral prior whatever he found amiss or contrary to the rules. In the [[Congregation of Cluny]] and others of the tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries there was also a greater prior (''prior major'') who preceded the claustral prior in dignity and, besides assisting the abbot in the government of the monastery, had some delegated jurisdiction over external dependencies of the abbey. In the high days of Cluny, the abbot was assisted by a [[coadjutor]] styled Grand-Prior (''Grand-prieur'' in French).

The '''Conventual prior''' (Latin ''prior conventualis'') is the independent superior of a monastery that is not an abbey (and which is therefore called a "priory"). In some orders, like the Benedictines, a monastery remains a priory until it is considered stable enough and large enough to be elevated to the rank of an abbey. In other Orders, like the [[Camaldolese]] and [[Carthusians]], conventual priors are the norm and there are no abbots. (The superior of the major houses of Camaldolese nuns, however, is called an [[abbess]].)

This title, in its feminine form '''prioress''', is used for monasteries of nuns in the Dominican and Carmelite orders.

An '''Obedientiary Prior''' heads a monastery created as a satellite of an abbey. When an abbey becomes overlarge, or when there is need of a monastery in a new area, the abbot may appoint a group of monks under a prior to begin a new foundation, which remains a dependency of the mother abbey until such time as it is large and stable enough to become an independent abbey of its own.

A '''Prior Provincial''' is the regional superior of certain Orders, such as the [[Order of Friars Preachers]] [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] or the [[Carmelite friars]]. In this last case, the head of the whole Order is called the [[prior general]].

Among communities of friars, the second superior is called the [[sub-prior]] and his office is similar to that of the claustral prior in the Benedictine Order.

==Other orders==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Some Orders have only one Grand prior (e.g., the [[Portuguese Order of Christ]]).{{fact|date=June 2018}}

Other Orders have several, each in charge of a geographical province called grand priory after him{{clarifyme|date=June 2018}} (as in the [[Order of Malta]]).{{fact|date=June 2018}}

[[Rajput]]s traditionally have their own distinct individual rituals of [[marriage]]. Marriage is considered one of the most important events in a couple's lives.

==Seven lives==
It is a relationship which is created for seven lives between the two families of the bride and the groom. It comprises a ceremony for the ''Tilak'' (engagement), the ''Ban'' (starting of the wedding ceremony), the ''Mel'' (the community feast), the ''Nikasi'' (the departure of the [[Bridegroom]] party for the wedding), the ''Sehla'', and the ''Dhukav'' (reception of the wedding party at the bride's place by her parents). Solemnisation of the wedding is referred to as ''Fera''.

==Bridegroom==
[[File:Rajput Sherwani 2014-04-23 04-27.JPG|200px|thumbnail|Achkan sherwani worn by [[Rajput]] men during a Rajput wedding in [[Rajasthan]], [[India]].]]
A unique Rajput ''[[sherwani]]'' also known as [[Achkan]] is normally worn by the bridegroom along with his own family form of a [[turban]]. He keeps a sword in his left hand during the ceremony.

==Bride==
A bride wears a ''Lahanga'', ''Odhani'', ''[[Kurta|Kurti]]'' or ''Poshak''. The ornaments worn by a Rajput Bride are the ''Rakhdi'' on her forehead, the ''Sheesphul'' as headgear, the ''aad'' as a thick neck hanging, the ''Baju'' above her elbow (on arms), the "poonchis" and "bangdis" as thick golden bangles in arms, "hathfools" on hands and the ''Pajeb'' as anklets.

The wedding dress and the "aad" is gifted by the groom's side to the bride. The barat at the time of "samela" presents them in the "padla" ( a collection of many lahanga, jewelry items, accessories, make-up kits, shoes etc.) for the bride.

'''Rohit''' or '''Rohitas''', also called '''[[Bhambi Khalpa|Bambhi]]''', are a [[chamar]] caste of [[Gujarat]], [[India]].&lt;ref name=R/&gt;

Rohit (or Rohitas) consider themselves to be followers or descendants of the famous saint [[Rohidas]]. Traditionally, they did leather or hide work and were identified as [[Khalpa]]. But in 1947, a group of Khalpa organized and decided to call themselves Rohit. They also abandoned all leather works.&lt;ref name=R/&gt;

The Rohit claim to have sprung from a union between a [[Rajput]] and a low caste woman. In the census of 1961, Rohits have been identified as one of the fifteen sub sections of the [[Chamar]] caste. They claim they are higher than [[Bhangi]]s and also claim to be higher in social hierarchy to [[chamar]]s and [[khalpa]]s. They are a non-vegetarian group.&lt;ref name=R/&gt;

From the 1930-40s Rohits were active in changing their caste name from Khlapa to Rohit, like others such as Dheds to [[Mahyavanshi]]s, Garua to Guru, and [[Bhangi]] to Rishi. Only Mahyavanshis were successful in getting official recognition from the Government of India to get a [[Kshatriya]] status officially. Although Rohit still maintain themselves to be a [[Rajput]], the claim has not been officially accepted by Government of India and they are still considered a sub-caste of [[Chamar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GRR5aUwQUVsC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=Rohit++mahyavanshi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NOSiTZ7WM8OHrAfyqJ2FAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Rohit%20%20mahyavanshi&amp;f=false] The Mahyavanshi: the success story of a scheduled caste By Y. A. Parmar (Page 91-92)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2000">'''Shahriyar V''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: شهریار) was the ruler of the [[Bavand dynasty]] from 1300 to 1310. He was the son and successor of [[Yazdagird of Tabaristan]].

After Shahriyar's accession of the Bavand throne in 1300, the [[Ilkhanid]] amir Mo'men marched towards [[Amol]] and greatly weakened the strength of Shahriyar's kingdom. Shahriyar died in 1310, leaving his kingdom in a weakened condition, which quickly fell into a war of succession between his brothers, [[Shah-Kaykhusraw]], and [[Shams al-Muluk Muhammad]]. Shah-Kaykhusraw, with Ilkhanid support, managed to emerge victorious during the civil war, and become the new king of the [[Bavand dynasty]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7024">{{hatnote|This article is about Sino-Christian theology. For discussion about God in traditional Chinese culture see "[[Chinese theology]]".}}
'''Sino-Christian theology'''  ({{zh|s=汉语神学|t=漢語神學|p=hànyǔ shénxué}} or {{zh|s=汉语基督教神学|t=漢語基督教神學|p=hànyǔ jīdūjiào shénxué}}, literally meaning "Christian theology in the Chinese language") is a [[theology|theological]] movement in [[Mainland China]] and [[Hong Kong]].

== Definition ==
There are two generally recognized senses of the term Sino-Christian theology.  In the broad sense, it belongs to the tradition of [[Indigenous church mission theory|indigenous theology]] which stretches as early as the works during the time of the [[Jesuit China missions]], until the present day.  However, these indigenizing efforts are often critiqued for a lacking in their assessments of traditional Chinese culture, particularly as found in [[Confucianism]].  In the narrow sense of the term, Sino-Christian theology is associated with [[Cultural Christian#China|cultural Christians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reading Christian Scriptures in China|last=Fällman|first=Fredrik|publisher=T &amp; T Clark|year=2008|isbn=978-0567638465|editor-last=Starr|editor-first=Chloë F.|location=New York|pages=49–60|chapter=Hermeneutical conflict? Reading the Bible in Contemporary China|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; like [[Liu Xiaofeng (academic)|Liu Xiaofeng]] and [[He Guanghu]] who have challenged the indigenizing approach and have proposed the greater need to articulate a critically reflective theology using the Chinese language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lai Pan-chiu  |author2=Jason T. S. Lam |lastauthoramp=yes |pages=8–9|chapter=Retrospect and Prospect of Sino-Christian Theology: An Introduction|title=Sino-Christian Theology: A Theological Qua Cultural Movement in Contemporary China|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|location=Frankfurt am Main|isbn=9783631604359|editor1=Pan-Chiu Lai |editor2=Jason Lam }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, it has been observed that there has perhaps been the growth of a younger generation of scholars in Sino-Christian theology.  While the earlier generation included so-called "[[Cultural Christian#China|cultural Christians]]" ({{zh|c=文化基督徒|p=wénhuà jīdūtú}}) who often used methodologies within the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]], the younger generation includes individuals who identify themselves as “Christian scholars” ({{zh|t=基督教學人|s=基督教学人|p=jīdūtú xuérén}}) with a greater commitment to the Christian faith and believe the use of the human sciences is inadequate for articulating Christian theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=He|first=Guanghu|title=China and Christianity|year=2008|publisher=SCM Press|location=London|pages=67–68|editor=Felix Wilfred |editor2=Edmond Tang |editor3=Georg Evers|chapter=Three Generations of Chinese Christianity Researchers: from the 1950s to 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many have become elders and pastors in [[Urban area|urban]] churches, and often gravitated towards [[Calvinism]] as a means to offer a [[public theology]] for the [[Christianity in China|Chinese Christian]] church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Christianity in Contemporary China: Socio-cultural Perspectives|last=Fällman|first=Fredrik|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0415528467|editor-last=Lim|editor-first=Francis Khek Gee|location=London|pages=153–168|chapter=Calvin, Culture and Christ?

== Theological themes ==
Much of the writings within this field have looked at Christian theology as a means to engage China, in its pursuit for [[modernity]]. Often, this has focused on comparing Western culture, shaped by [[Christianity]], with Chinese culture, shaped by [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism|Daoism]].

One areas of discussion has been around the Christian doctrine of [[sin]]. [[Liu Xiaofeng (academic)|Liu Xiaofeng]] and [[Zhuo Xinping]], for instance, have described China as having a "[[Shame society|culture of joy]]" whereas the West has a "[[Guilt society|culture of sin]]." In a post-[[Cultural Revolution]] context, they explain how the doctrine of [[original sin]] is useful in explaining the social ills that exist in contemporary Chinese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhuo|first=Xinping|date=1995|title=Original Sin in the East-West Dialogue -a Chinese View|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/swc.1995.1.1.80|journal=Studies in World Christianity|volume=1|issue=1|pages=80–86|doi=10.3366/swc.1995.1.1.80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chow|first=Alexander|date=2013|title=The East Asian Rediscovery of ‘Sin’|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/swc.2013.0048|journal=Studies in World Christianity|volume=19|issue=2|pages=129–131|doi=10.3366/swc.2013.0048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area is with regards to [[morality]]. Whereas Confucianism is often understood as fundamentally a system of ethics, some have written about how the Christian understanding of morality has been shaped by the two commands of loving God and loving neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhuo|first=Xinping|date=2001|title=Religion and Morality in Contemporary China|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/swc.2001.7.1.34|journal=Studies in World Christianity|volume=7|issue=1|pages=40|doi=10.3366/swc.2001.7.1.34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yang Huilin]] has gone as far as to compare [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] with the [[Cultural Revolution]], and speak of how the Christian virtues of love and forgiveness may benefit the Chinese context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=China, Christianity, and the Question of Culture|last=Yang|first=Huilin|publisher=Baylor University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1481300179|location=Waco, TX|pages=61–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term is derived from the [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] {{lang|la|peccatum Sodomiticum}} or "sin of Sodom", which in turn comes from the Ancient Greek word {{lang|grc|Σόδομα}} (Sódoma).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myetymology.com/english/sodomy.html myetymology.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916041421/http://www.myetymology.com/english/sodomy.html |date=2012-09-16 }}, Sodomy&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (chapters 18–20) tells how God wished to destroy the "sinful" cities of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. Two angels are invited by [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] to take refuge with his family for the night. The men of Sodom surround Lot's house and demand that he bring the messengers out so that they may "know" them (the expression includes sexual connotations). Lot protests that the "messengers" are his guests and offers the Sodomites his virgin daughters instead, but then they threaten to "do worse" with Lot than they would with his guests. Then the angels strike the Sodomites blind, "so that they wearied themselves to find the door." (Genesis 19:4-11, [[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]])

In current usage, the term is particularly used in law. [[Sodomy law|Laws]] prohibiting sodomy were seen frequently in past Jewish, Christian, and Islamic civilizations, but the term has little modern usage outside Africa, Asia, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sodomylaws.org/ sodomy laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704130716/http://www.sodomylaws.org/ |date=2007-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws in the United States have been challenged and have sometimes been found unconstitutional or been replaced with different legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html|title=''Lawrence v. Texas'' in which The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that sodomy laws are unconstitutional on June 26, 2003|author=|date=|website=cornell.edu|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406071731/https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html|archivedate=6 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cognates in other languages, such as [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|[[:fr:sodomie|sodomie]]}} (verb {{lang|fr|sodomiser}}), [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{lang|es|[[:es:sodomía|sodomía]]}} (verb {{lang|es|sodomizar}}), and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|[[:pt:sodomia|sodomia]]}} (verb {{lang|pt|sodomizar}}), are used exclusively for penetrative anal sex, at least since the early nineteenth century. In those languages, the term is also often current [[vernacular]] (not just legal, unlike in other cultures) and a formal way of referring to any practice of anal penetration; the word ''sex'' is commonly associated with consent and pleasure with regard to all involved parties and often avoids directly mentioning two common aspects of social [[taboo]]—human sexuality and the anus—without a shunning or archaic connotation to its use.

In modern [[German language|German]], the word {{lang|de|[[:de:Sodomie|Sodomie]]}} has no connotation of anal or oral sex and specifically refers to [[zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Paragraph 175#Version of June 28.2C 1935|Paragraph 175 StGB, version of June 28, 1935]].&lt;/ref&gt; The same goes for the [[Polish language|Polish]] {{lang|pl|[[:pl:sodomia|sodomia]]}}. The [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word {{lang|no|[[:no:sodomi|sodomi]]}} carries both senses. In [[Danish language|Danish]], {{lang|da|[[:da:sodomi|sodomi]]}} is rendered as "unnatural [[carnal knowledge]] with [[Gay sexual practices|someone of the same sex]] or (now) with [[Zoophilia|animals]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ordnet.dk/ods/ordbog?query=sodomi "Sodomi"] (''[[Ordbog over det danske Sprog]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], the word for sodomy,  {{lang|ar|لواط|rtl=yes}} (Arabic pronunciation: {{lang|ar-Latn|liwāṭ}}; Persian pronunciation {{lang|fa-Latn|lavât}}), is derived from the same source as in Western culture, with much the same connotations as English (referring to most sexual acts prohibited by the [[Qur'an]]). Its direct reference is to [[Islamic view of Lot|Lot]] (لوط ''Lūṭ'' in Arabic) and a more literal interpretation of the word is "the practice of Lot", but more accurately it means "the practice of Lot's people" (the Sodomites) rather than Lot himself.
 
The word ''[[wikt:sod#Etymology 2|sod]]'', a noun or verb (to "sod off") used as an insult, is derived from ''sodomite''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sod Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. Main Entry: sod] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422175451/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sod |date=2009-04-22 }}&lt;nowiki&gt;[3,noun]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

''Sod'' is used as slang in the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and is considered mildly offensive. However, in New Zealand and Australia it is not considered offensive at all, but only 'coarse', because it is locally assumed, even if incorrectly, that it refers to 'sod' as in a wet clump of dirt.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

While religion and the law have had a fundamental role in the historical definition and punishment of sodomy, sodomitical texts present considerable opportunities for ambiguity and interpretation. Sodomy is both a real occurrence and an imagined category. In the course of the eighteenth century, what is identifiable as sodomy often becomes identified with effeminacy, for example, or in opposition to a discourse of manliness. In this regard, Ian McCormick has argued that "an adequate and imaginative reading involves a series of intertextual interventions in which histories become stories, fabrications and reconstructions in lively debate with, and around, 'dominant' heterosexualities ... Deconstructing what we think we see may well involve reconstructing ourselves in surprising and unanticipated ways."&lt;ref&gt;Ian McCormick, ''Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing.'' (London and New York: Routledge), p. 9, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Hebrew Bible===
In the Hebrew Bible, [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] was a city destroyed by God because of the evil of its inhabitants. No specific sin is given as the reason for God's great wrath. The story of Sodom's destruction — and of [[Abraham]]'s failed attempt to intercede with God and prevent that destruction — appears in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18-19.  The connection between Sodom and homosexuality is derived from the described attempt by a mob of the city's people to rape [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s male guests. Some suggest the sinfulness for which Sodom was destroyed might have consisted mainly in the violation of obligations of hospitality, which were important for the original writers of the Biblical account.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, pp. 92–98&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 19-21, there is an account, similar in many ways, where Gibeah, a city of the Benjamin tribe, is destroyed by the other tribes of Israel in revenge for a mob of its inhabitants raping and killing a woman.
Neither view about why Sodom was destroyed takes into account the fact that its destruction was planned before the guests arrived in the city, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18:17.

Many times in the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] and [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], writers use God's destruction of Sodom to demonstrate His awesome power. This happens in [[Deuteronomy]] 29; [[Isaiah]] 1, 3, and 13; [[Jeremiah]] 49 and 50; [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 4; [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 4.11; and [[Zephaniah]] 2.9. Deuteronomy 32, Jeremiah 23.14, and Lamentations 4 reference the sinfulness of Sodom but do not specify any particular sin.

Specific sins which Sodom is linked to by the prophets of the Old Testament are [[adultery]] and [[lie|lying]] ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|23:14|KJV|}}).

In Ezekiel 16, a long comparison is made between Sodom and the [[kingdom of Judah]]. "Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you acted more corruptly in all your conduct than they." (v. 47, NASB) "Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. (vss. 49–50, NASB) (Note that the Hebrew for the word "thus" is the conjunction "ו" which is usually translated "and", thus KJV, NIV, and CEV omit the word entirely.)

There is no explicit mention of any sexual sin in Ezekiel's summation and "abomination" is used to describe many sins.

The [[Authorized King James Version]] translates {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:17|KJV}} as "There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel," but the word corresponding to "sodomite" in the Hebrew original, Qadesh ([[Hebrew]]:קדש), does not refer to Sodom and has been translated in the [[New International Version]] as "[[Sacred prostitution|shrine prostitute]]"; male shrine prostitutes may have served barren women in fertility rites rather than engaging in homosexual acts; this also applies to other instances of the word sodomite in the King James Version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Roman Empire period===

==== New Testament ====
The [[New Testament]], like the [[Old Testament]], references Sodom as a place of God's anger against sin, but the [[Epistle of Jude]] provides a certain class of sin as causative of its destruction, the meaning of which is disputed.

{{quotation|1=Jude 1:5  I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
&lt;br&gt;6  And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
&lt;br&gt;7  Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.|2=[[Authorized King James Version]]&lt;br&gt;[http://studybible.info/compare/Jude%201:7 Compare Jude 1:7 in multiple versions]}}

The Greek word in the New Testament from which the phrase is translated "giving themselves over to fornication", is "ekporneuō" ("ek" and "porneuō"). As one word it is not used elsewhere in the New Testament, but occurs in the [[Septuagint]] to denote whoredom (Genesis 38:24 and Exodus 34:15). Some modern translations as the [[NIV]] render it as "sexual immorality".

The Greek words for "strange flesh" are "heteros", which almost always basically denotes "another/other", and "sarx",  a common word for "flesh", and usually refers to the physical body or the nature of man or of an ordinance.

In the Christian expansion of the prophets, they further linked Sodom to the sins of [[impenitence]] ({{bibleverse||Matthew|11:23|KJV|}}), careless living ({{bibleverse||Luke|17:28|KJV|}}), [[fornication]] ({{bibleverse||Jude|1:7|KJV|}} [[KJV]]), and an overall "filthy" lifestyle ({{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:7|KJV|}}), which word ("aselgeiais") elsewhere is rendered in the KJV as [[lasciviousness]] ({{bibleverse||Mark|7:22|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:21|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:19|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Peter|4:3|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Jude|1:4|KJV|}}) or [[incontinence (philosophy)|wantonness]] ({{bibleverse||Romans|13:13|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:18|KJV|}}).

====Epistle of Jude====
The [[Epistle of Jude]] in the New Testament echoes the Genesis narrative and potentially adds the sexually immoral aspects of Sodom's sins: "just as [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire". (v. 7, English Standard Version). The phrase rendered "sexual immorality and unnatural desire" is translated "strange flesh" or "false flesh", but it is not entirely clear what it refers to.

One theory is that it is just a reference to the "strange flesh" of the intended rape victims, who were angels, not men.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Countering this is traditional interpretation, which notes that the angels were sent to investigate an ongoing regional problem(Gn. 18) of fornication, and extraordinarily so, that of a homosexual nature,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Barnes' Notes on the Bible&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent's Word Studies&lt;/ref&gt;  "out of the order of nature."&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the Old and New Testaments by Robert Jamieson, A. R. Fausset and David Brown&lt;/ref&gt; "Strange" is understood to mean "outside the moral law",&lt;ref&gt;Word pictures in the New Testament, Archibald Thomas Robertson&lt;/ref&gt; ({{bibleverse||Romans|7:3|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Galatians|1:6|KJV}}) while it is doubted that either Lot or the men of Sodom understood that the strangers were angels at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Gn. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philo====
The [[Hellenistic]] [[Jewish]] [[philosopher]] [[Philo]] (20 BC - 50 AD)  described the inhabitants of Sodom in an extra biblical account:

"As men, being unable to bear discreetly a satiety of these things, get restive like cattle, and become stiff-necked, and discard the laws of nature, pursuing a great and intemperate indulgence of gluttony, and drinking, and unlawful connections; for not only did they go mad after other women, and defile the marriage bed of others, but also those who were men lusted after one another, doing unseemly things, and not regarding or respecting their common nature, and though eager for children, they were convicted by having only an abortive offspring; but the conviction produced no advantage, since they were overcome by violent desire; and so by degrees, the men became accustomed to be treated like women, and in this way engendered among themselves the disease of females, and intolerable evil; for they not only, as to effeminacy and delicacy, became like women in their persons, but they also made their souls most ignoble, corrupting in this way the whole race of men, as far as depended on them" (133-35; ET Jonge 422-23).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/8326130/The-Works-of-Philo The works of Philo a contemporary of Josephius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119043027/http://www.scribd.com/doc/8326130/The-Works-of-Philo |date=2016-01-19 }} Page 528&lt;/ref&gt;

====Josephus====
The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] used the term "Sodomites" in summarizing the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] narrative: "About this time the Sodomites grew proud, on account of their riches and great wealth; they became unjust towards men, and impious towards [[God]], in so much that they did not call to mind the advantages they received from him: they hated strangers, and abused themselves with Sodomitical practices" "Now when the Sodomites saw the young men to be of beautiful countenances, and this to an extraordinary degree, and that they took up their lodgings with Lot, they resolved themselves to enjoy these beautiful boys by force and violence; and when Lot exhorted them to sobriety, and not to offer any thing immodest to the strangers, but to have regard to their lodging in his house; and promised that if their inclinations could not be governed, he would expose his daughters to their lust, instead of these strangers; neither thus were they made ashamed." (''Antiquities'' 1.11.1,3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216095250/http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-1.htm |archivedate=2009-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; — circa AD 96). His assessment goes beyond the Biblical data, though it is seen by conservatives as defining what manner of fornication (Jude 1:7) Sodom was given to.

===Medieval Christendom===
[[File:Dante sodom.jpg|thumb|[[Dante]] and [[Virgil]] interview the sodomites, from {{Interlanguage link multi|Guido da Pisa|it}}'s commentary on the ''Commedia'', c. 1345]]

The primarily sexual meaning of the word ''sodomia'' for Christians did not evolve before the 6th century AD. [[Byzantine Emperor|Roman Emperor]] [[Justinian I]], in his novels no. 77 (dating 538) and no. 141 (dating 559) amended to his [[Corpus iuris civilis]], and declared that Sodom's sin had been specifically same-sex activities and desire for them. He also linked "famines, earthquakes, and pestilences"  upon cities as being due to "such crimes",&lt;ref&gt;trans. in Derrick Sherwin Bailey, Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition, (London: Longmans, Green, 1955), 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; during a time of recent earthquakes and other disasters (see [[Extreme weather events of 535–536]]). He may have also used the anti-homosexual laws he enacted upon personal and political opponents, in case he could not prove them guilty of anything else.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

While adhering to the death penalty by beheading as punishment for homosexuality or adultery, Justinian's legal novels heralded a change in Roman legal paradigm&lt;ref&gt;For the legal and cultural background in [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] prior to Christian rule, see [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]] and ''[[Lex Scantinia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in that he introduced a concept of not only secular but also divine punishment for homosexual behavior. Individuals might ignore and escape secular laws, but they could not do the same with divine laws, if Justinian declared his novels to be such.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Christians earlier than Justinian are also seen to denounce same-sex relations. St. [[John Chrysostom]] in the 4th century regarded such as worse than murder in his fourth homily on {{bibleverse||Romans|1:26-27|KJV}} [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210204.htm], while [[Paul the Apostle]] in the ''[[Epistle to the Romans]]'' referred to same sex relations as ''"shameful lust"'' and which acts were contrary to nature,  with men suffering a ''"due penalty"'' in their bodies. Just like the Jews, early Christians prior to Justinian I are not known to have used the word ''sodomia'' for the carnal sin they abhorred, though [[Philo of Alexandria]] (20 BC - 50 AD)&lt;ref&gt;Jewish philosopher, Writing on the life of Abraham&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Methodius of Olympus]] (AD 260-312)&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the sin of Sodom&lt;/ref&gt; attributed homosexual relations to Sodom, as may have Josephus, (AD 37 – c. 100)&lt;ref&gt;Antiquities 1.11.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;33-34; ET Jonge 422-23; The Sodom tradition in Romans Biblical Theology Bulletin, Spring, 2004 by Philip F.

Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom may have been forgotten today (as some hold it had been, along with his law novellizations regarding homosexual behavior immediately after his death) had it not been made use of in fake [[Charlemagne|Charlemagnian]] [[capitularies]], fabricated by a [[Franks|Frankish]] monk using the pseudonym Benedictus Levita ("Benedict the Levite") around 850 AD, as part of the [[Pseudo-Isidore]]. Benedict's three capitularies particularly dealing with Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom were:

*''XXI. De diversis malorum flagitiis.'' ("No. 21: On manifold disgraceful wrongs")
*''CXLIII. De sceleribus nefandis ob quae regna percussa sunt, ut penitus caveantur.'' ("No. 143: On sinful vices due to which empires have crumbled, so that we shall do our best to beware of them")
*''CLX. De patratoribus diversorum malorum.'' ("No. 160: On the perpetrators of manifold evil deeds")

It was in these fake capitularies where Benedictus utilized Justinian's interpretation as a justification for ecclesiastical supremacy over mundane institutions, thereby demanding{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} burning at the stake for carnal sins in the name of Charlemagne himself. Burning had been part of the standard penalty for homosexual behavior particularly common in Germanic [[protohistory]] (as according to Germanic folklore, sexual deviance and especially same-sex desire were caused by a form of malevolence or spiritual evil called ''[[Nīþ|nith]]'', rendering those people characterized by it as non-human fiends, as ''nithings''), and Benedictus most probably was of the Germanic tribe of the Franks.

Benedict broadened the meaning for ''sodomy'' to all sexual acts not related to procreation that were therefore deemed ''counter nature'' (so for instance, even solitary masturbation and anal intercourse between a male and a female were covered), while among these he still emphasized all interpersonal acts not taking place between human men and women, especially homosexuality.

Benedict's rationale was that the punishment of such acts was in order to protect all Christianity from divine punishments such as natural disasters for carnal sins committed by individuals, but also for heresy, superstition and heathenry. According to Benedictus, this was why all mundane institutions had to be subjected to ecclesiastical power in order to prevent moral as well as religious laxity causing divine wrath.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

[[File:Execution Sodomites Ghent 1578 (1).jpg|thumb|Monks accused of sodomy burned at the stake, [[Ghent]] 1578]]
For delaying reasons described in the article [[Pseudo-Isidore]], but also because his crucial demands for capital punishment had been so unheard of in ecclesiastical history priorly based upon the humane Christian concept of forgiveness and mercy, it took several centuries before Benedict's demands for legal reform began to take tangible shape within larger ecclesiastical initiatives.

This came about with the [[Medieval Inquisition]] in 1184. The sects of [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] were a common target, and these heretics were not only persecuted for alleged satanism but were increasingly accused of fornication and sodomy.  In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges levelled during the [[Trial of the Knights Templar]].  Some of these charges were specifically directed at the Grand Master of the order, [[Jacques de Molay]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman "The Guilt of the Templars" (New York: Basic Books, 1966): 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is this event which led into the medieval and early-modern [[witch hunts]] that were also largely connoted with sodomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Templars|author=W.

Persecution of Cathars and the [[Bogomiles]] sect in [[Bulgaria]] led to the use of a term closely related to ''sodomy'': ''buggery'' derives from French ''bouggerie'', meaning "of Bulgaria".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of ''sodomy'' with hereticism, satanism, and witchcraft was supported by the Inquisition trials. The resulting infamy of sodomy motivated a continuing discrimination and persecution of homosexuals and sexual deviants in general long after the Medieval period had ended. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The [[Book of Wisdom]], which is included in the Biblical canon by Orthodox and Roman Catholics, but excluded by modern Jews, Protestants, and other Christian denominations, makes reference to the story of Sodom, further emphasizing that their sin had been failing to practice hospitality:

:"And punishments came upon the sinners not without former signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness, insomuch as they used a more hard and hateful behavior toward strangers."
:"For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom they knew not when they came: but these brought friends into bondage, that had well deserved of them." ([[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/kjv.Wis.19.html#Wis.19.13 Wisdom 19:13-14])

===Sodomy laws in 18th-century Europe===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2010}}
[[File:Amsterdam sodomites 1730.png|thumb|upright|A [[wanted poster]], published in the city of [[Amsterdam]] in 1730, accusing ten men of "the abominable crime of sodomy" ({{lang|nl|de verfoeyelyke Crimen van Sodomie}})]]

An examination of trials for rape and sodomy during the 18th century at the [[Old Bailey]] in London shows that the treatment of rape was often lenient, while the treatment of sodomy was often severe. However, the difficulty of proving that penetration and ejaculation had occurred meant that men were often convicted of the lesser charge of 'assault with sodomitical intent', which was not a capital offence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Crimes.jsp#assaultwithsodomiticalintent Crimes tried at the Old Bailey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602121130/https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Crimes.jsp |date=2017-06-02 }}, ''Proceedings of the Old Bailey'' online&lt;/ref&gt;

In France in the 18th century, sodomy was still theoretically a capital crime, and there are a handful of cases where sodomites were executed. However, in several of these, other crimes were involved as well. Records from the Bastille and the police lieutenant d'Argenson, as well as other sources, show that many who were arrested were exiled, sent to a regiment, or imprisoned in places (generally the Hospital) associated with moral crimes such as prostitution. Of these, a number were involved in prostitution or had approached children, or otherwise gone beyond merely having homosexual relations. Ravaisson (a 19th-century writer who edited the Bastille records) suggested that the authorities preferred to handle these cases discreetly, lest public punishments in effect publicize "this vice".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}
[[File:Hangin outside Newgate Prison.jpg|left|thumb|An execution taking place outside Newgate Prison]]
Periodicals of the time sometimes casually named known sodomites, and at one point even suggested that sodomy was increasingly popular. This does not imply that sodomites necessarily lived in security - specific police agents, for instance, watched the [[Tuileries]], even then a known cruising area. But, as with much sexual behaviour under the Old Regime, discretion was a key concern on all sides (especially since members of prominent families were sometimes implicated) - the law seemed most concerned with those who were the least discreet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}

In 1730, there was a wave of sodomy trials in the [[Netherlands]]; some 250 men were summoned before the authorities; 91 faced decrees of exile for not appearing. At least 60 men were sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;Rictor Norton, [http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/1730news.htm The Dutch Purge of Homosexuals 1730] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518101647/http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/1730news.htm |date=2012-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last two Englishmen that were hanged for sodomy were executed in 1835.

==Modern sodomy laws==
{{main|Sodomy law}}

===United States===
{{Main|Sodomy laws in the United States}}

In the 1950s, all states had some form of law criminalizing sodomy, and in 1986 the United States Supreme Court ruled that nothing in the United States Constitution bars a state from prohibiting sodomy. However, state legislators and state courts had started to repeal or overturn their sodomy laws, beginning with Illinois in 1961, and thus in 2003, only 10 states had laws prohibiting all sodomy, with penalties ranging from 1 to 15 years imprisonment. Additionally, four other states had laws that specifically prohibited same-sex sodomy.

On June 26, 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in a 6–3 decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' struck down the [[Texas]] same-sex sodomy law, ruling that this private sexual conduct is protected by the liberty rights implicit in the [[Due process|due process clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], with [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s concurring opinion arguing that they violated equal protection. (''See [[Sodomy law]].)'' This decision invalidated all  [[U.S. state|state]] sodomy laws insofar as they applied to noncommercial conduct in private between consenting civilians and overruled its 1986 ruling in ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' which upheld [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s sodomy law.

In the [[U.S. military]], the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals has ruled that the ''Lawrence v. Texas'' decision applies to Article 125 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], the statute banning sodomy.  In ''United States v. Stirewalt'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;CRAWFORD, Chief Judge (concurring in part and in the result): I agree with the result in this case but I "would reserve for another day the questions of whether and how ''Lawrence'' [''v. Texas'', 539 U.S. 558 (2003)] applies to the military. "1  ''Like United States v. Marcum'', "the factual differences between Lawrence and Appellant's case are striking" for the reasons mentioned by the majority as well as the circumstances surrounding the charges themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/03-0433.htm|title=U.S. v. Stirewalt|author=|date=|website=www.armfor.uscourts.gov|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525185749/http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/03-0433.htm|archivedate=25 May 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stirewalt's conviction of sodomy stood due to the circumstances surrounding the crime. The court went on to say that despite ''Lawrence''{{'}}s application to the military, Article 125 can still be upheld in cases where there are "factors unique to the military environment" which would place the conduct "outside any protected liberty interest recognized in ''Lawrence''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/02-0944.htm|title=U.S. v.

''United States v. Meno'' and ''United States v. Bullock'' are two known cases in which consensual sodomy convictions have been overturned in military courts under the ''Lawrence'' precedent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sldn.org/binary-data/SLDN_ARTICLES/pdf_file/2309.pdf United States v. Meno, United States Court of  Criminal Appeals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227001854/http://www.sldn.org/binary-data/SLDN_ARTICLES/pdf_file/2309.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religions==
Views on sodomy in some contemporary [[world religion]]s.

===Judaism===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw ''good''.
:— [[Authorized King James Version|KJV]], {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:49-50|KJV}}).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Classical Jewish texts are seen by many as not stressing the homosexual aspect of the attitude of the inhabitants of Sodom as much as their cruelty and lack of [[hospitality]] to the "stranger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/homopho2.htm|title=A History of Homophobia: 2 The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah|author=|date=|website=rictornorton.co.uk|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608042052/http://rictornorton.co.uk/homopho2.htm|archivedate=8 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th-century Jewish scholar [[Nachmanides]] wrote, "According to our sages, they were notorious for every evil, but their fate was sealed for their persistence in not supporting the poor and the needy." His contemporary Rabbenu Yonah expresses the same view: "Scripture attributes their annihilation to their failure to practice ''[[tzedakah]]'' [charity or justice]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/publicat/hazon/tzedaka/Tzedakah_Activists_Vs_Sodomites.html|title=Tzedakah Activists Vs. Sodomites|author=|date=|website=www.shemayisrael.co.il|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813013341/http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/publicat/hazon/tzedaka/Tzedakah_Activists_Vs_Sodomites.html|archivedate=13 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Prohibitions on same-sex activities among men (#157) and bestiality (#155–156) are among the [[613 commandments]] as listed by [[Maimonides]] in the 12th century; however, their source in [[Leviticus 18]] does not contain the word ''sodomy''. The idea that homosexual intercourse was involved as at least a part of the evil of Sodom arises from the story in [[Genesis 19]] (NIV):

{{quote|Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house. They called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them." ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|19:4-7|KJV;NIV|Gen.19:4&amp;ndash;7 compare}}) 
The Hebrew verb used is ''to know'', which can have a sexual meaning in the Bible, but doesn't always, and might have a sexual meaning here, judging from Lot's shocked reaction:
"No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing&amp;nbsp;..."}}

===Christianity===
The traditional interpretation sees the primary sin of Sodom as being homoerotic sexual acts,&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. J. Gagnon, ''The Bible and Homosexual Practice'', pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernsem.edu/files/westernsem/gagnon_autm05_0.pdf Gagnon, ''Why the Disagreement over the Biblical Witness on Homosexual Practice'', pp. 46–50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512090559/http://www.westernsem.edu/files/westernsem/gagnon_autm05_0.pdf |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting the Sodom narrative with [[Leviticus 18]], which lists various sexual crimes, which, according to verses 27 and 28, would result in the land being "defiled":

{{quote|for the inhabitants of the land, who were before you, committed all of these abominations, and the land became defiled; otherwise the land will vomit you out for defiling it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.}}

Some scholars, such as Per-Axel Sverker, align this passage with the traditional interpretation, claiming that the word [[Abomination (Bible)|abomination]] refers to sexual misconduct, and that while homoerotic acts were not the only reason Sodom and Gomorrah were condemned, it was a significant part of the picture.

Others, the earliest of whom was [[D.S. Bailey|Derrick Sherwin Bailey]], claim that this passage contradicts the traditional interpretation altogether. In their view the sins of Sodom were related more to violation of [[hospitality]] laws than sexual sins.&lt;ref&gt;Derrick Bailey, ''Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition'' (Hamden: Conn.: Archon, 1975 reprint from 1955), 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; This also coincides with traditional Jewish interpretations of these texts as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Destruction of Sodom|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/246615/jewish/The-Destruction-of-Sodom.htm|website=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad (Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement)|accessdate=4 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402022353/http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/246615/jewish/The-Destruction-of-Sodom.htm|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary word in contention is the Hebrew word ''yâda‛'' used for ''know'' in the Old Testament. Biblical scholars disagree on what "know" in this instance refers to, but most of conservative Christianity interprets it to mean "sexual intercourse",&lt;ref&gt;Greg Bahnsen, ''Homosexuality: A Biblical View'' (Phillipsburg: Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing, 1978), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Reformed Response to Daniel Helminiak's Gay Theology'', by Derrick K. Olliff and Dewey H. Hodges&lt;/ref&gt; while the opposing position interprets it to mean "interrogate."&lt;ref&gt;John J. McNeil, ''The Church and the Homosexual'', p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Lot's offering of his two virgins has been interpreted to mean that Lot is offering a compromise to assure the crowd that the two men have no untoward intentions in town, or that he is offering his virgins as a substitute for the men to "know" by sexual intercourse.

Those who oppose the interpretation of sexual intent toward Lot's guests point out that there are over 930 occurrences of the Hebrew word (yâda‛) for "know" in the Old Testament, and its use to denote sexual intercourse only occurs about a dozen times, and in the [[Septuagint]] it is not rendered sexually. Countering this is the argument that most of the uses of ''yâda‛'' denoting sex is in Genesis,&lt;ref&gt;''Homosexuality and the Old Testament'', P. Michael Ukleja&lt;/ref&gt; (including once for premarital sex: Genesis 38:26), and in verse 8 sex the obvious meaning. Its use in the parallel story in Judges 19 is also invoked in support of this meaning,&lt;ref&gt;''Sodom: Inhospitality or Homosexuality?'', by Dave Miller, Ph.D., Apologetics Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. James B. DeYoung, ''Homosexuality'', pp. 118–122&lt;/ref&gt; with it otherwise providing the only instance of "knowing" someone by violence.

===Islam===
While the [[Quran]] clearly disapproves of the sexual practices of the "people of Lot" ("What, of all creatures do ye come unto the males, and leave the wives your Lord created for you?"&lt;ref&gt;Sura 26:165–167, quoted in Wafer, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;), only one passage can be interpreted as taking a particular legal position towards such activities:

{{quote|As for the two of you who are guilty thereof, punish them both; and if they repent and improve, then let them be. Lo, God is relenting, merciful.&lt;ref&gt;Sura 4:16, quoted in Wafer, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
[[Hadith]] (reports of [[Muhamma]]d's sayings and deeds from those close to him in his lifetime) on the subject are inconsistent, with different writers interpreting the Prophet in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Wafer, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shariah]] (Islamic law) defines sodomy outside marriage as adultery or fornication or both, and it thus attracts the same penalties as those crimes (flogging or death), although the exact punishment varies with schools and scholars.&lt;ref name="Jong"&gt;Jivraj &amp; de Jong, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, few modern Muslim countries have legal systems based fully on Shariah, and an increasing number of Muslims do not look to shariah but to the Quran itself for moral guidance.&lt;ref name="Jong"/&gt; For sodomy within marriage, the majority of [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] interpreters hold that (1) anal intercourse, while strongly disliked, is not ''haram'' (forbidden) provided the wife agrees; and (2), if the wife does not agree, then it is preferable to refrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/m_morals/chap3b.htm|title=Chapter Three: The Islamic Sexual Morality (2) Its Structure|author=|date=|website=Al-Islam.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016184024/http://www.al-islam.org/m_morals/chap3b.htm|archivedate=16 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the formal disapproval of religious authority, [[Gender segregation and Islam|gender segregation in Muslim societies]] and the strong emphasis on virility leads adolescents and unmarried young men to seek alternative sexual outlets to women, especially with males younger than themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt &amp; Sofer, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Not all sodomy is homosexual, but for many young men heterosexual sodomy is considered better than vaginal penetration, and female prostitutes report the demand for anal penetration from their male clients.&lt;ref&gt;Dialmy, pp. 32 and 35, footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its location, this once powerful state developed complex technology utilizing maritime resources. In addition, its economy became progressively reliant on the booming trade in the region, thus transforming it into a prestige goods based economy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Humanity|last=Laet|first=Sigfried J. de|last2=Herrmann|first2=Joachim|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was involved in close interactions, often rivalries, with the neighbouring [[Medang Kingdom|Java]], [[Khmer Empire|Kambuja]] and [[Champa]]. Srivijaya's main foreign interest was nurturing lucrative trade agreements with [[China]] which lasted from the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] to the [[Song dynasty]]. Srivijaya had religious, cultural and trade links with the Buddhist [[Pala Empire|Pala]] of [[Bengal]], as well as with the Islamic Caliphate in the [[Middle East]].

The kingdom ceased to exist in the 13th century due to various factors, including the expansion of the rival [[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[Singhasari]] and [[Majapahit]] empires.&lt;ref name="end"/&gt; After Srivijaya fell, it was largely forgotten. It was not until 1918 that French historian [[George Cœdès]], of [[École française d'Extrême-Orient]], formally postulated its existence.&lt;ref name="MUNOZ 117"/&gt;

== Etymology ==
Srivijaya is a [[Sanskrit]]-derived name: श्रीविजय, ''Śrīvijaya'', and it was known in many names, including [[Javanese language|Javanese]]: ꦯꦿꦶꦮꦶꦗꦪ, [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]: {{sund|ᮞᮢᮤᮝᮤᮏᮚ}}, {{lang-th|ศรีวิชัย}} {{RTGS|''Siwichai''}}, [[Khmer language|Khmer]]: ស្រីវិជ័យ ''Srey Vichey'', and {{lang-zh|s=三佛齊|}} ''Sanfoqi''.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|131}}

In [[Sanskrit]], ''śrī''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=sri&amp;direct=au|title=Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit|last=Glashoff|first=Klaus|website=spokensanskrit.org|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; means "fortunate", "prosperous", or "happy" and ''vijaya''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=vijaya&amp;direct=au|title=Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit|last=Glashoff|first=Klaus|website=spokensanskrit.org|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; means "victorious" or "excellence".&lt;ref name="MUNOZ 117"&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|title=Early Kingdoms |pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the combined word ''Srivijaya'' means "shining victory",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2007/06/07/srivijaya-a-primer-part-1/|title=Srivijaya: A primer - Part 1 {{!}} SEAArch - Southeast Asian Archaeology|date=2007-06-07|work=SEAArch - Southeast Asian Archaeology|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; "splendid triumph", "prosperous victor", "radiance of excellence" or simply "glorious". 

Initially, historians of early 20th-century that studied the inscriptions of Sumatra and the neighboring islands, thought that the term "Srivijaya" refer to a person's name — a king to be exact. The Sundanese manuscript of [[Carita Parahyangan]] composed around the late 16th-century in West Java, mentioned vaguely about a princely hero that rose to be a king named [[Sanjaya of Mataram|Sanjaya]] that after secured his rule in Java — involved in battle with the Malayu and Keling, against their king named "Sang Sri Wijaya". The term [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]] is Javanese-Sundanese term to refer Malay people of Sumatra, while [[Keling]] — derived from historical [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga kingdom]] of Southern India, refer to people of Indian descent that inhabit the archipelago. Fascinatingly, the name Srivijaya still being found in this local manuscript, although was mistakenly refer to a king. Subsequently, after studying both local stone inscriptions, manuscripts and Chinese historical accounts, historians concluded that the term "Srivijaya" refer to a polity or a kingdom.

==Historiography==
[[File:Talang Tuo Inscription.jpg|thumb|left|[[Talang Tuwo inscription]], discovered in [[Bukit Seguntang]] area, tell the establishment of sacred Śrīksetra park.]]
Little physical evidence of Srivijaya remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Taylor | title =Indonesia| pages = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been no continuous knowledge of the history of Srivijaya even in Indonesia and Malaysia; its forgotten past has been resurrected by foreign scholars. Contemporary Indonesians, even those from the area of Palembang (around which the kingdom was based), had not heard of Srivijaya until the 1920s when the French scholar, [[George Cœdès]], published his discoveries and interpretations in the Dutch- and Indonesian-language newspapers.&lt;ref name="TAYLOR_26"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor|first=Jean Gelman|title=Indonesia: Peoples and Histories|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2003 |location= New Haven and London|url= |doi= |pages=8–9|isbn= 0-300-10518-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cœdès noted that the Chinese references to "[[Sanfoqi]]", previously read as "Sribhoja", and the inscriptions in [[Malay language|Old Malay]] refer to the same empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krom|first=N.J.|chapter= Het Hindoe-tijdperk |title= Geschiedenis van Nederlandsch Indië|editor= F.W.

The Srivijayan historiography was acquired, composed and established from two main sources: the Chinese historical accounts and the Southeast Asian stone inscriptions that have been discovered and deciphered in the region. The Buddhist pilgrim [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]]'s account is especially important on describing Srivijaya, when he visited the kingdom in 671 for six months. The 7th-century ''siddhayatra'' inscriptions discovered in Palembang and Bangka island are also vital primary historical sources. Also, regional accounts that some might be almost tales and legends, such as the [[Zabag kingdom|Legend of the Maharaja of Javaka and the Khmer King]] also provides a glimpse of the kingdom. Besides, some Indian and Arabic accounts also describes vaguely about the riches and fabulous fortune of the king of Zabag.

The historical records of Srivijaya were reconstructed from a number of stone inscriptions, most of them written in Old Malay using [[Pallava script]], such as the [[Kedukan Bukit inscription|Kedukan Bukit]], [[Talang Tuwo inscription|Talang Tuwo]], [[Telaga Batu inscription|Telaga Batu]] and [[Kota Kapur inscription]]s.&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F.

In the 20th century, both empires were referred to by nationalistic intellectuals to argue for an Indonesian identity within an Indonesian state that had existed prior to the colonial state of the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref name="TAYLOR_26"/&gt;

Srivijaya, and by extension Sumatra, had been known by different names to different peoples. The Chinese called it ''[[Sanfotsi|Sanfoqi]]'' or ''Che-li-fo-che'' (''Shilifoshi''), and there was an even older kingdom of [[Kantoli]], which could be considered the predecessor of Srivijaya.&lt;ref name="MUNOZ 114"&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|title=Early Kingdoms |pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|title=Early Kingdoms |pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] texts referred to it as ''Yavades'' and ''Javadeh'', respectively.&lt;ref name="MUNOZ 114" /&gt; The Arabs called it ''[[Zabag Kingdom|Zabag]]'' or ''Sribuza'' and the Khmers called it ''Melayu''.&lt;ref name="MUNOZ 114" /&gt; While the Javanese called them ''[[Suvarnabhumi]]'', ''Suvarnadvipa'' or ''Malayu.'' This is another reason why the discovery of Srivijaya was so difficult.&lt;ref name="MUNOZ 114" /&gt; While some of these names are strongly reminiscent of the name of "Java", there is a distinct possibility that they may have referred to Sumatra instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Krom |first= N.J. |title= Het oude Java en zijn kunst |edition =2nd| year= 1943|publisher= Erven F.

==Capital==
[[File:Srivijaya Archaeological Park Palembang Indonesia.svg|thumb|right|[[Srivijaya Archaeological Park]] (green) located Southwest from the centre of [[Palembang]]. The site forms an axis connecting [[Bukit Seguntang]] and [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]].]] 
According to the [[Kedukan Bukit inscription]], dated 605 Saka (683), Srivijaya was first established in the vicinity of today's Palembang, on the banks of [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]]. It mentions that Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa came from Minanga Tamwan. The exact location of Minanga Tamwan is still a subject of discussion. The Palembang theory as the place where Srivijaya was first established was presented by Cœdes and supported by Pierre-Yves Manguin. [[Soekmono]], on the other hand, argues that Palembang was not the capital of Srivijaya and suggests that the [[Kampar River]] system in [[Riau]] where the [[Muara Takus]] temple is located as Minanga Tamwan.&lt;ref name="Soekmono"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Drs. R. Soekmono | title= ''Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2''| edition= 2nd | publisher = Penerbit Kanisius | year= 1973 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ua_L2i3HgOIC&amp;hl=id&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions |location =Yogyakarta| page=38|isbn=9789794132906|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palembang left little archaeological traces of ancient urban settlement. This is probably because of the nature of Palembang environment — a low lying plain which frequently flooded by Musi River. Expert suggests that the ancient Palembang settlement was formed as a collection of [[floating house]]s made from [[Thatching|thatched materials]], such as wood, bamboo and straw roof. The 13th century Chinese account confirmed this; in his book Chu-Fan-Chi, [[Zhao Rugua|Chau-Ju-kua]] mentioned that "The residents Sanfo-tsi (Srivijaya) live scattered outside the city on the water, within rafts lined with reeds." It was probably only [[Kadatuan]] (king's court) and religious structures were built on land, while the people live in floating houses along Musi River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Konsep Mendesa di Ibu Kota Sriwijaya, Sampai kini, konsep ibu kota Sriwijaya masih dapat disaksikan | work = National Geographic Indonesia | date = 17 September 2013 | author = Reynold Sumayku | url = http://nationalgeographic.co.id/berita/2013/09/konsep-mendesa-di-ibu-kota-sriwijaya | language = Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palembang and its relevance to the early Malay state suffered a great deal of controversy in terms of its evidence build up through the archaeological record. Strong historical evidence found in Chinese sources, speaking of city like settlements as early as 700 AD, and later Arab travelers, who visited the region during the 10th and 11th centuries, held written proof, naming the kingdom of Srivijaya in their context. As far as early state-like polities in Malay archipelago, the geographical location of modern Palembang was a possible candidate for the 1st millennium kingdom settlement like Srivijaya as it is the best described and most secure in historical context, its prestige was apparent in wealth and in urban characteristics, and the most unique, which no other 1st millennium kingdom held, was its location in junction to three major rivers, the Musi, the Komering, and the Ogan. The historical evidence was contrasted in 1975 with publications by Bennet Bronson and Jan Wisseman. Findings at certain major excavation sites, such as Geding Suro, Penyaringan Air Bersih, Sarang Wati, and [[Bukit Seguntang]], conducted in the region played major roles in the negative evidence of the 1st millennium kingdom in the same region. It was noted that the region contained no locatable settlements earlier than the middle of the second millennium.

Lack of evidence of southern settlements in the archaeological record come from the disinterest in the archeologist and the unclear physical visibility of the settlement themselves. Archeology of the 1920s and 1930s focused more on art and epigraphy found in the regions. Some northern urban settlements were sited due to some overlap in fitting the sinocentic model of city-state urban centers. An approach to differentualize between urban settlements in the southern regions from the northern ones of Southeast Asia was initiated by a proposition for an alternative model. Excavations showed failed signs of a complex urban center under the lens of a sinocentric model, leading to parameters of a new proposed model. Parameters for such a model of a city-like settlement included isolation in relevance to its hinterland. No hinterland creates for low archaeological visibility. The settlement must also have access to both easy transportation and major interregional trade routes, crucial in a region with few resources. Access to the former and later play a major role in a creation of extreme economic surplus in the absence of an exploited hinterland. The urban center must be able to organize politically without the need of ceremonial foci such as temples, monuments and inscriptions. Lastly, habitations must be impermanent, being highly probable in the region Palembang and of southern Southeast Asia. Such a model was proposed to challenge city concepts of ancient urban centers in Southeast Asia and basic postulates themselves such as regions found in the South, like Palembang, based their achievements in correlation with urbanization.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bronson|first=Bennet|last2=Wisseman|first2=Jan|date=17 April 1975|title=Palembang as Srivijaya The Lateness of Early Cities in Southern Southeast Asia|url=|journal=Asian Perspectives|volume=19|issue=2|pages=220–239|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the contradicting pattern found in southern regions, like Palembang, in 1977 Bennet Bronson developed a speculative model for a better understanding of the Sumatran coastal region, such as insular and peninsular Malaysia, the Philippines, and western Indonesia. Its main focus being the relationship of political, economical and geographical systems. The general political and economical pattern of the region seems irrelevant to other parts of the world of their time, but in correlation with their maritime trade network it produced high levels of socio-economic complexity. He concluded, from his earlier publications in 1974 that state development in this region developed much differently than the rest of early Southeast Asia. Bronson’s model was based on the dendritic patterns of a drainage basin where its opening leads out to sea. Being that historical evidence places the capital in Palembang, and in junction of three rivers, the Musi, the Komering, and the Ogan, such model can be applied. In order for the system to function appropriately several constraints are required. Inability for terrestrial transportation results in movements of all good through water routes, lining up economical patterns with the dendritic patterns formed by the streams. The second being the overseas center is economically superior to the ports found at the mouth of the rivers, having a higher population and a more productive and technologically advanced economy. Lastly, constraints on the land work against and do not developments of urban settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bronson|first=Bennet|date=1977|title=Exchange at the Upstream and Downstream Ends: Notes toward Functional Model of the Coastal State in Southeast Asia|url=|journal=Economic Exchange and Social Interaction in Southeast Asia|volume=|pages=39–52|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An aerial photograph taken in 1984 near [[Palembang]] (in what is now [[Sriwijaya Kingdom Archaeological Park]]) revealed the remnants of ancient man-made canals, moats, ponds, and artificial islands, suggesting the location of Srivijaya's urban centre. Several artefacts such as fragments of inscriptions, Buddhist statues, beads, pottery and Chinese ceramics were found, confirming that the area had, at one time, dense human habitation.&lt;ref name="Dinas Pendidikan Provinsi Sumatera Selatan"&gt;Ahmad Rapanie, Cahyo Sulistianingsih, Ribuan Nata, "Kerajaan Sriwijaya, Beberapa Situs dan Temuannya", Museum Negeri Sumatera Selatan, Dinas Pendidikan Provinsi Sumatera Selatan.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1993, Pierre-Yves Manguin had shown that the centre of Srivijaya was along the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]] between [[Bukit Seguntang]] and Sabokingking (situated in what is now Palembang, [[South Sumatra]], Indonesia).&lt;ref name="MUNOZ 117" /&gt; Palembang is called in {{zh|c=巨港|p=Jù gǎng|l=Giant Harbour}}, this is probably a testament of its history as once a great port.

However, in 2013, archaeological research led by the [[University of Indonesia]] discovered several religious and habitation sites at [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]], suggesting that the initial centre of Srivijaya was located in [[Muaro Jambi Regency]], [[Jambi]] on the [[Batang Hari River]], rather than on the originally-proposed Musi river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koran-jakarta.com/index.php/detail/view01/124087/hl |title=Peneliti UI Temukan Bukti Kerajaan Sriwijaya di Jambi |language=Indonesian |date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological site includes eight excavated temple sanctuaries and covers about 12 square kilometers, stretches 7.5 kilometers along the Batang Hari River, 80 ''menapos'' or mounds of temple ruins, are not yet restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lovejambi.com/wisata-unik-di-candi-muaro-jambi.html|title=Muaro Jambi Temple: The Legacy of Ancient Jambi|date=25 September 2011|access-date=3 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630104221/http://lovejambi.com/wisata-unik-di-candi-muaro-jambi.html|archive-date=30 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Temple&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/11/25/muarajambi-temple-jambi-s-monumental-mystery.html |title=Muarajambi Temple: Jambi’s monumental mystery |author=Syofiardi Bachyul Jb |date=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muaro Jambi archaeological site was Mahayana-Vajrayana Buddhist in nature, which suggests that the site served as the Buddhist learning center, connected to the 10th century famous Buddhist scholar [[Dharmakīrtiśrī|Suvarṇadvipi Dharmakīrti]]. Chinese sources also mentioned that Srivijaya hosts thousands of Buddhist monks.

Another theory suggests that Dapunta Hyang came from the east coast of the [[Malay Peninsula]], and that the [[Chaiya District]] in [[Surat Thani Province]], [[Thailand]], was the centre of Srivijaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www7.plala.or.jp/seareview/newpage6Sri2011Chaiya.html |title=Śrīvijaya―towards ChaiyaーThe History of Srivijaya |author=Takashi Suzuki |date=25 December 2012 |work  = |publisher= |accessdate =6 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Srivijayan Period is referred to the time when Srivijaya ruled over present day southern Thailand. In the region of Chaiya, there is clear evidence of Srivijayan influence seen in artwork inspired by Mahayana Buddhism. Because of the large amount of remains, such as the Ligor stele, found in this region, some scholars attempted to prove Chaiya as the capital rather than Palembang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hindu-Buddhist Architecture in Southeast Asia|last=Chihara|first=Daigorol|last2=Giebel|first2=Rolf W.|publisher=Brill|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period was also a time for art.

However, some scholars believe that ''Chaiya'' probably comes from Sri Vi'''jaya.''' It was a regional capital in the Srivijaya empire. Some Thai historians argue it was the capital of Srivijaya itself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1971/JSS_062_1m_ChandChirayuRajani_ReviewArticleBackgroundToSriVijaya.pdf |title= Background To The Sri Vijaya Story-Part |author=Chand Chirayu Rajani |journal=Journal of the Siam Society |volume=62 |year=1974 |pages=174–211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is generally discounted.
[[File:006 Step to Gate (28938933061).jpg|thumb|right|By late 8th century, the political capital was shifted to Central Java, when the [[Sailendra]]s rose to become the Maharaja of Srivijaya.]]
In the second half of the eighth century, the capital of Srivijayan Mandala seems to be relocated and reestablished in Central Java, in the splendid court of [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]] located somewhere in fertile [[Kedu Plain|Kedu]] and [[Kewu Plain]], in the same location of the majestic [[Borobudur]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]] and [[Prambanan]] monuments. This unique period is known as the Srivijayan episode in Central Java, when the monarch of [[Sailendra]]s rose to become the Maharaja of Srivijaya. By that time, Srivijayan Mandala seems to be consists of the federation or an alliance of city-states, spanned from Java to Sumatra and Malay Peninsula, connected with trade connection cemented with political allegiance. By that time Srivijayan trading centers remains in Palembang, and to further extent also includes ports of Jambi, Kedah and Chaiya; while its political, religious and ceremonial center was established in Central Java.

==History==

===Formation and growth===

====Siddhayatra====
[[File:Prasasti Kedukan Bukit 3.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kedukan Bukit inscription]] displayed in the [[National Museum of Indonesia]].]]
{{History of Indonesia}}
Around the year 500, the roots of the Srivijayan empire began to develop around present-day Palembang, Sumatra. The [[Kedukan Bukit inscription]] (683), discovered on the banks of the Tatang River, near [[Sriwijaya Kingdom Archaeological Park|Karanganyar site]],  mentioned that the empire of Srivijaya was founded by [[Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa]] and his retinue. He had embarked on a sacred ''siddhayatra''&lt;ref&gt;According to Coedès, ''siddhayatra'' refers to some "magic potion". An alternative translation, however, is possible: [[Petrus Josephus Zoetmulder|Zoetmulder]]'s ''Dictionary of Old Javanese'' (1995) renders it as "a prosperous journey".&lt;/ref&gt; journey, and led 20,000 troops and 312 people in boats with 1312 foot soldiers from Minanga Tamwan to [[Jambi]] and [[Palembang]].

From the Sanskrit inscriptions, it is notable that Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa launched a maritime conquest in 684 with 20,000 men in the ''siddhayatra'' journey to acquire wealth, power, and 'magical powers'.&lt;ref&gt;Farrington, Karen. Historical Atlas of Empires. New York: Checkmark Books, 2002. 101. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa, the [[Melayu Kingdom]] became the first kingdom to be integrated into Srivijaya. This possibly occurred in the 680s. Melayu, also known as Jambi, was rich in gold and held in high esteem at the time. Srivijaya recognised that the submission of Melayu would increase its own prestige.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|title=Early Kingdoms |pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire was organised in three main zones: the estuarine capital region centred on Palembang, the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]] basin which served as hinterland, and rival estuarine areas capable of forming rival power centres. The areas upstream of the Musi River were rich in various commodities valuable to Chinese traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|title=Early Kingdoms |pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital was administered directly by the ruler while the hinterland remained under its own local [[Datuk|datu]]s or [[tribal chief]]s, who were organised into a network of alliances with the Srivijaya [[maharaja]] or king. Force was the dominant element in the empire's relations with rival river systems such as the [[Batang Hari River]], centred in Jambi.

The [[Telaga Batu inscription]], discovered in Sabokingking, eastern Palembang, is also a ''siddhayatra'' inscription. It is highly possible that this 7th century inscription was used in some kind of oath allegiance ritual. The top of the stone is adorned with seven [[nāga]] heads, and on the lower portion, there is some kind of water spout to channel the liquid that was likely poured over the stone during a ceremonial allegiance ritual. The ritual demonstrate the use of [[curse]] in ''sumpah'' (allegiance) ritual for those who commit treason against Kadatuan Srivijaya.

The [[Talang Tuwo inscription]], is also a ''siddhayatra'' inscription. Discovered in [[Bukit Seguntang]], western Palembang, this inscription tells about the establishment of the bountiful Śrīksetra garden endowed by King Jayanasa of Srivijaya, for the well being of all creatures.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|82–83}} It is highly possible that the currently Bukit Seguntang site was the location of Srivijaya's Śrīksetra garden.

====Regional conquests====
According to the [[Kota Kapur inscription]] discovered on [[Bangka Island]], the empire conquered most of southern Sumatra and the neighbouring island of Bangka, as far as Palas Pasemah in [[Lampung]]. Also, according to the inscriptions, Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa launched a military campaign against Java in the late 7th century, a period which coincided with the decline of [[Tarumanagara]] in West Java and the [[Kalingga Kingdom|Kalingga]] in Central Java. The empire thus grew to control the trade on the [[Strait of Malacca]], the [[Sunda Strait]], the [[South China Sea]], the [[Java Sea]], and the [[Karimata Strait]].

Chinese records dating to the late 7th century mention two Sumatran kingdoms as well as three other kingdoms on Java as being  part of Srivijaya. By the end of the 8th century, many western Javanese kingdoms, such as Tarumanagara and Kalingga, were within the Srivijayan sphere of influence.

===Golden age===
[[File:Avalokiteçvara, Malayu Srivijaya style.jpg|upright|thumb|left|The golden Malayu-Srivijayan [[Avalokiteśvara]], Rataukapastuo, Muarabulian, Jambi, Indonesia.]]

The 7th century [[Sojomerto inscription]] mentioned that an Old Malay-speaking Shivaist family led by Dapunta Selendra, has established themselves in Batang area, northern coast of Central Java. He was possibly the progenitor of Sailendra family. By early 8th century, an influential Buddhist family related to Srivijaya dominated Central Java.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|title=Early Kingdoms |pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family was the [[Sailendra]]s.&lt;ref name="MUNOZ 132"&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|title=Early Kingdoms |pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sailendras were of Javanese origin.&lt;ref name="ISEAS-Zakharov"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Sailendras Reconsidered | first = Anton O. | last = Zakharov | work = Institute of Southeast Asian Studies | location = Singapore | date = August 2012 | url = https://iseas.edu.sg/images/pdf/nsc_working_paper_series_12.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] of Srivijaya intermarried with the Sailendras of Central Java.

====Conquest of Malay Peninsula====
{{History of Malaysia}}
[[File:Malay Kingdoms en.svg|thumb|Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula. By the turn of the 8th century the states in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula were fell under Srivijayan domination.]]
During the same century, [[Langkasuka]] on the Malay Peninsula became part of Srivijaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|title=Early Kingdoms |pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after this, [[Pan Pan (kingdom)|Pan Pan]] and [[Tambralinga]], which were located north of Langkasuka, came under Srivijayan influence. These kingdoms on the peninsula were major trading nations that transported goods across the peninsula's isthmus.

The [[Ligor inscription]] in Vat Sema Muang, mentioned that Maharaja of Srivijaya, [[Dharmasetu]] ordered the construction of three sanctuaries dedicated to [[Padmapani|Bodhisattvas Padmapani]], [[Vajrapani]] and [[Buddha]] located in Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|first=Paul Michel|title=Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|year=2006|location=Singapore|url= |doi= |pages=130–131|isbn= 981-4155-67-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription further stated that the Dharmasetu was the head of the Sailendras of [[Java]]. This is the first instance of relationship known existed between Srivijaya and the [[Sailendra]]. With the expansion into Java and the Malay Peninsula, Srivijaya controlled two major trade [[choke point]]s in Southeast Asia; Malacca and Sunda straits. Some Srivijayan temple ruins are observable in [[Thailand]] and [[Cambodia]].

At some point in the late 7th century, [[Champa|Cham]] ports in eastern Indochina started to attract traders. This diverted the flow of trade from Srivijaya. In an effort to divert the flow, the Srivijayan [[Maharaja]] [[Dharmasetu]], launched various raids against the coastal cities of Indochina. The city of [[Indrapura (Champa)|Indrapura]] by the [[Mekong]] was temporarily controlled from Palembang in the early 8th century.&lt;ref name="MUNOZ 132" /&gt; The Srivijayans continued to dominate areas around present-day Cambodia until the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] King [[Jayavarman II]], the founder of the [[Khmer Empire]] dynasty, severed the Srivijayan link later in the same century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|title=Early Kingdoms |pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Srivijayan rule in Central Java====
{{main|Sailendra|Medang Kingdom}}
The Sailendras of Java established and nurtured a dynastic alliance with the Sumatran Srivijayan lineage, and then further established their rule and authority in [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram Kingdom]] of Central Java.

In Java, [[Dharanindra]]'s successor was [[Samaragrawira]] (r. 800—819), mentioned in [[Nalanda inscription]] (dated 860) as the father of [[Balaputradewa]], and the son of ''Śailendravamsatilaka'' (the jewel of the Śailendra family) with stylised name ''Śrīviravairimathana'' (the slayer of a heroic enemy), which refers to Dharanindra.&lt;ref name=indianised&gt;{{Cite book

He appointed [[Khmer people|Khmer]] Prince [[Jayavarman II|Jayavarman]] as the governor of [[Indrapura (Khmer)|Indrapura]] in the Mekong delta under Sailendran rule. This decision was later proven to be a mistake, as Jayavarman later revolted, moved his capital further inland north from [[Tonle Sap]] to [[Mahendraparvata]], severed the link to Srivijaya and proclaimed [[Khmer Empire|Cambodian]] independence from Java in 802. Samaragrawira was mentioned as the king of Java that married Tārā, daughter of [[Dharmasetu]].&lt;ref name="indianised" /&gt;{{rp|108}} He was mentioned as his other name Rakai Warak in [[Mantyasih inscription]].

Earlier historians, such as N. J. Krom and Cœdes, tend to equate Samaragrawira and [[Samaratungga]] as the same person.&lt;ref name="indianised" /&gt;{{rp|92}} However, later historians such as Slamet Muljana equate Samaratungga with Rakai Garung, mentioned in Mantyasih inscription as fifth monarch of Mataram kingdom. This would mean that Samaratungga was the successor of Samaragrawira.

Dewi Tara, the daughter of Dharmasetu, married [[Samaratunga]], a member of the Sailendra family who later assumed throne of Srivijaya, around 792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|first=Paul Michel|title=Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|year=2006|location=Singapore|url= |doi= |pages=175|isbn= 981-4155-67-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 8th century, the Srivijayan court was virtually located in Java, as the Sailendras monarch rose to become the Maharaja of Srivijaya.

[[File:Borobudur-Temple-Park Indonesia Stupas-of-Borobudur-04.jpg|right|thumb|The construction of the [[Borobudur]] completed under the reign of Samaratunga of Sailendra dynasty.]]

After Dharmasetu, Samaratungga became the next Maharaja of Srivijaya. He reigned as ruler from 792 to 835. Unlike the expansionist Dharmasetu, Samaratungga did not indulge in military expansion but preferred to strengthen the Srivijayan hold of Java. He personally oversaw the construction of the grand monument of [[Borobudur]]; a massive stone [[mandala]], which was completed in 825, during his reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|title=Early Kingdoms |pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cœdès, "in the second half of the ninth century Java and Sumatra were united under the rule of a Sailendra reigning in Java... its center at Palembang."&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|92}} Samaratungga just like Samaragrawira, seems to be deeply influenced by peaceful Mahayana Buddhist beliefs and strived to become a peaceful and a benevolent ruler. His successor was Princess [[Pramodhawardhani]] who was betrothed to Shivaite [[Rakai Pikatan]], son of the influential Rakai Patapan, a landlord in Central Java. The political move that seems as an effort to secure peace and Sailendran rule on Java by reconciling the Mahayana Buddhist with Shivaist Hindus.

====Return to Palembang====
Prince [[Balaputra]], however, opposed the rule of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani in Central Java. The relations between Balaputra and Pramodhawardhani is interpreted differently by some historians. Older theory according to Bosch and De Casparis holds that Balaputra was the son of Samaratungga, which means he was the younger brother of Pramodhawardhani. Later historians such as Muljana on the other hand, argued that Balaputra was the son of Samaragrawira and the younger brother of Samaratungga, which means he was the uncle of Pramodhawardhani.&lt;ref name="Srivijaya21"&gt;{{cite book | author=Muljana, Slamet | title=Sriwijaya | publisher=Yogyakarta: LKiS |year=2006 | page=21 | language=Indonesian | isbn=979-8451-62-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known whether Balaputra was expelled from Central Java because of succession dispute with Pikatan, or was he already ruled in Suvarnadvipa (Sumatra). Either ways, it seems that Balaputra eventually ruled the Sumatran branch of Sailendra dynasty and enthroned in Srivijayan capital of [[Palembang]]. Historians argued that this was because Balaputra's mother — Tara, the queen consort of King Samaragrawira was the princess of Srivijaya, this rendered Balaputra as the heir of Srivijayan throne. Balaputra the Maharaja of Srivijaya later stated his claim as the rightful heir of Sailendra dynasty from Java, as proclaimed in [[Nalanda inscription]] dated 860.&lt;ref name="indianised" /&gt;{{rp|108}}

After trade disruption at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] between 820 and 850, the ruler of Jambi ([[Melayu Kingdom]]) was able to assert enough independence to send missions to [[China]] in 853 and 871.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The Melayu kingdom's independence coincided with the troubled times when the [[Sailendra]]n [[Balaputradewa]], was expelled from Java and, later, he seized the throne of Srivijaya. The new maharaja was able to dispatch a tributary mission to China by 902. Two years after that, the expiring [[Tang Dynasty]] conferred a title on a Srivijayan envoy.

In the first half of the 10th century, between the fall of Tang Dynasty and the rise of [[Song Dynasty|Song]], there was brisk trading between the overseas world with the [[Fujian]] kingdom of [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Min]] and the rich [[Guangdong]] kingdom of Nan Han. Srivijaya undoubtedly benefited from this. Sometime around 903, the [[Muslim]] writer [[Ibn Rustah]] was so impressed with the wealth of the Srivijayan ruler that he declared that one would not hear of a king who was richer, stronger or who had more revenue. The main urban centres of Srivijaya were then at Palembang (especially the [[Srivijaya archaeological park|Karanganyar site]] near [[Bukit Seguntang]] area), [[Muara Jambi]] and [[Kedah]].

====Srivijayan exploration====
The core of the Srivijayan realm was mainly concentrated in and around the straits of Malacca and Sunda; in Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula and Western Java. However, between the 9th and the 12th centuries, the influence of Srivijaya seems to be extended far beyond their core realm. Srivijayan navigators, sailors and traders seems to be engaged in extensive trade and exploration, which reached coastal [[Borneo]], the [[Philippines archipelago]], Eastern Indonesia, coastal Indochina, [[Bay of Bengal]] and [[Indian Ocean]], as far as [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref name="PH"&gt;{{cite book | title = Philippine History | publisher = Rex Bookstore, Inc. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9789712339349 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=Philippines+Srivijaya&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilje3-2ufSAhXIKo8KHSM1CEkQ6AEISjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Philippines%20Srivijaya&amp;f=false | page = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The migration to [[Madagascar]] accelerated in the 9th century when Srivijaya controlled much of the maritime trade in the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref name="History of Madagascar"/&gt; The migration to Madagascar was estimated to have taken place 1,200 years ago around 830 CE. According to an extensive new mitochondrial DNA study, native Malagasy people today can likely trace their heritage back to the 30 founding mothers who sailed from Indonesia 1,200 years ago.&lt;ref name="Madagascar Founded By Women"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/history/madagascar-women-120320.html |title=Madagascar Founded By Women  |publisher=Discovery.com|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malagasy contains loan words from Sanskrit, with all the local linguistic modifications via [[Javanese language|Javanese]] or [[Malay language|Malay]], hint that Madagascar may have been colonised by settlers from the Srivijaya.&lt;ref name="A small cohort of Island Southeast Asian women founded Madagascar"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2012/03/15/rspb.2012.0012.full |title=A small cohort of Island Southeast Asian women founded Madagascar |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |author=Murray P.

The 10th century Arab account ''Ajayeb al-Hind'' (Marvels of India) gives an account of invasion in Africa, probably by Malay people of Srivijaya, in 945-946 CE. They arrived in the coast of [[Tanganyika]] and [[Mozambique]] with 1000 boats and attempted to take the citadel of Qanbaloh, though eventually failed. The reason of the attack is because that place had goods suitable for their country and for China, such as ivory, tortoise shells, panther skins, and [[ambergris]], and also because they wanted black slaves from [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people (called ''Zeng'' or ''Zenj'' by Malay, ''Jenggi'' by Javanese) who were strong and make good slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anthony Reid and the Study of the Southeast Asian Past|last=Reid|first=Anthony|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|year=2012|isbn=9814311960|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 12th century, the kingdom included parts of [[Sumatra]], the [[Malay Peninsula]], Western [[Java]], [[Borneo]] and the [[Philippines]], most notably the [[Sulu Archipelago]] and the [[Visayas]] islands (it is believed by some historians that the name 'Visayas' is derived from the empire).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rasul|first=Jainal D.|title=Agonies and Dreams: The Filipino Muslims and Other Minorities|publisher=CARE Minorities|year=2003|location=Quezon City|url= |doi= |pages=77|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PH"/&gt;

====War against Java====
[[File:032 Avadana Level 1, Ship and Crew.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[Borobudur ship|Javanese vessel]] depicted in Borobudur. In 990 King [[Dharmawangsa]] of Java launched a naval attack against Srivijaya in Sumatra.]]
In the 10th century, the rivalry between Sumatran Srivijaya and the Javanese [[Medang]] kingdom became more intense and hostile. The animosity was probably caused by Srivijaya's effort to reclaim the Sailendra lands in Java or by Medang's aspiration to challenge Srivijaya domination in the region. In East Java, the [[Anjukladang inscription]] dated from 937 mentioned about infiltration attack from Malayu — which refer to a Srivijayan attack upon Medang Kingdom of East Java. The villagers of Anjuk Ladang was awarded for their service and merit on assisting the king's army — under the leadership of [[Mpu Sindok]], on repelling invading Malayu (Sumatra) forces, subsequently a ''jayastambha'' (victory monument) was erected in their honor.

In 990, King [[Dharmawangsa]] of Java launched a naval invasion against Srivijaya and attempted to capture the capital Palembang. The news of Javanese invasion of Srivijaya was recorded in Chinese Song period sources. In 988, a Srivijayan envoy was sent to Chinese court in Guangzhou. After sojourned for about two years in China, the envoy learned that his country has been attacked by ''She-po'' (Java) thus made him unable to return home. In 992 the envoy from ''She-po'' (Java) arrived in Chinese court and explaining that their country has involved in continuous war with ''San-fo-qi'' (Srivijaya). In 999 the Srivijayan envoy sailed from China to Champa in an attempt to return home, however he received no news about the condition of his country. The Srivijayan envoy then sailed back to China and appealed to the Chinese Emperor for the protection of Srivijaya against Javanese invaders.&lt;ref name="Kulke"&gt;{{cite book | title = Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: Reflections on the Chola Naval Expeditions to Southeast Asia, Volume 1 of Nalanda-Sriwijaya series |editor=Hermann Kulke |editor2=K Kesavapany |editor3=Vijay Sakhuja |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year=2009 |isbn=9789812309372 |url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=2swhCXJVRzwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|229}}

Dharmawangsa's invasion led the Maharaja of Srivijaya, Sri [[Cudamani Warmadewa]] to seek protection from China. Srivijayan Maharaja, Sri Cudamani Warmadewa was proven as an able and astute ruler, with shrewd diplomatic skills. In the midst of crisis brought by Javanese invasion, he secured Chinese political support by appeasing the Chinese Emperor. In 1003, a Song historical record reported that the envoy of ''San-fo-qi'' was dispatched by the king ''Shi-li-zhu-luo-wu-ni-fo-ma-tiao-hua'' (Sri Cudamani Warmadewa). The Srivijayan envoy told Chinese court that in their country a Buddhist temple had been erected to pray for the long life of Chinese Emperor, thus asked the emperor to give the name and the bell for this temple which was built in his honor. Rejoiced, the Chinese Emperor named the temple ''Ch'eng-t'en-wan-shou'' ('ten thousand years of receiving blessing from heaven, which is China) and a bell was immediately casted and sent to Srivijaya to be installed in the temple.&lt;ref name="Kulke"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

In 1006, Srivijaya's alliance proved its resilience by successfully repelling the Javanese invasion. The Javanese invasion is ultimately unsuccessful. This attack has opened the eyes of Srivijayan Maharaja of how dangerous Javanese Medang Kingdom could be, and further contemplate, patiently laid a plan and effort to destroy his Javanese nemesis. In retaliation, Srivijaya assisted Haji (king) Wurawari of Lwaram to revolt, which led to the attack and destruction of the Medang palace. This sudden and unexpected attack took place during the wedding ceremony of Dharmawangsa's daughter, which rendered the court unprepared and shocked. With the death of Dharmawangsa and the fall of the Medang capital, Srivijaya  contributed to the collapse of Medang kingdom, leaving Eastern Java in further unrest, violence and, ultimately, desolation for several years to come.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|130,132,141,144}}

===Decline===
[[File:Battle of kedah.jpg|thumb|right|A Siamese painting depicting the Chola raid on Kedah.]]

====Chola invasion====
{{see also|Chola invasion of Srivijaya}}
The contributory factors in the decline of Srivijaya are foreign piracy and raids that disrupted the trade and security in the region. Attracted to the wealth of Srivijaya, [[Rajendra Chola]], the [[Chola]] king from [[Tamil Nadu]] in [[South India]], [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya|launched naval raids on ports of Srivijaya]] and conquered [[Kedah|Kadaram]] (modern Kedah) from Srivijaya in 1025.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|142–143}} The Cholas are known to have benefitted from both [[piracy]] and foreign trade. At times, the Chola seafaring led to outright plunder and conquest as far as Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOfjaW7C3AsC&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=Chola+piracy&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BNKWT5LNKsH3rQeXs8HXDQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Chola%20piracy&amp;f=false |title=Societies, Networks, and Transitions: A Global History |author=Craig A.

With the Maharaja Sangrama Vijayottunggavarman imprisoned and most of its cities destroyed, the leaderless Srivijaya mandala entered a period of chaos and confusion. The invasion marked the end of the [[Sailendra]] dynasty rule of Srivijaya. According to the 15th-century Malay annals Sejarah Melayu, [[Rajendra Chola I]] after the successful naval raid in 1025 married Onang Kiu, the daughter of Vijayottunggavarman.&lt;ref name="Buddhism, Diplomacy p.226"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: Reflections on the Chola Naval Expeditions to by Hermann Kulke, K Kesavapany, Vijay Sakhuja p.71&lt;/ref&gt; This invasion forced Srivijaya to make peace with [[Java]]nese kingdom of [[Kahuripan]]. The peace deal was brokered by the exiled daughter of Vijayottunggavarman, who managed to escape the destruction of Palembang, and came to the court of King [[Airlangga]] in [[East Java]]. She also became the queen consort of Airlangga named Dharmaprasadottungadevi and in 1035, Airlangga constructed a Buddhist monastery named Srivijayasrama dedicated to his queen consort.&lt;ref name="Munoz"&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|first=Paul Michel|title=Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|year=2006|location=Singapore|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=NqwuAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Early+Kingdoms+of+the+Indonesian+Archipelago+and+the+Malay+Peninsula&amp;dq=Early+Kingdoms+of+the+Indonesian+Archipelago+and+the+Malay+Peninsula&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5lbnE5s3OAhXHQI8KHbWuCWcQ6AEIHTAA |doi= |isbn= 981-4155-67-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|163}}

The Cholas continued a series of raids and conquests of parts of Sumatra and Malay Peninsula for the next 20 years. The expedition of [[Rajendra Chola I]] had such a lasting impression on the Malay people of the period that his name is even mentioned (in the corrupted form as ''Raja Chulan'') in the medieval Malay chronicle, the  ''Sejarah Melayu'' ([[Malay Annals]]).&lt;ref name="Buddhism, Diplomacy p.226"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History Without Borders: The Making of an Asian World Region, 1000-1800  by Geoffrey C.

[[File:Chaiya Wat Kaew.jpg|right|thumb|Ruins of the Wat Kaew in Chaiya, dating from Srivijayan times]]
King Rajendra Chola overseas expeditions against Srivijaya was a unique event in India's history and its otherwise peaceful relations with the states of Southeast Asia. The reasons of the naval expeditions are uncertain as the sources are silent about its exact causes. Nilakanta Sastri suggests that the attacks were probably caused by Srivijaya's attempts to throw obstacles in the way of the Chola trade with the East or, more probably, a simple desire on the part of King Rajendra Chola to extend his military victories to the countries that were well known so as to add lustre to his crown.&lt;ref name="Kulke"/&gt; It gravely weakened the Srivijayan hegemony and enabled the formation of regional kingdoms like [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]], which were based on intensive agriculture rather than coastal and long-distance trade. With the passing of time, the regional trading center shifted from the old Srivijayan capital of Palembang to another trade centre on the island of Sumatra, [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Jambi]], which was the centre of [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]].&lt;ref name="Singapore"/&gt;

Although the Cholas did not established a direct rule over Srivijayan court, Chola nobles were accepted graciously in Srivijayan court. In 1067, a Chola prince named Divakara or Devakala was sent as a Srivijayan ambassador to the Imperial Court of China. The prince who was the nephew of Rajendra Chola later was enthroned in 1070 as [[Kulothunga Chola I]]. The humiliating defeat of Srivijayan Mandala against foreign invasion, has exposed the weaknesses and vurnerability of Srivijayan allegiance and alliance model. Among the disillusioned regional polities that jump out of the wagon, [[Kedah Kingdom|Kedah]] was the first that rebelled against the central Srivijayan authority. As the response, Srivijaya asked the Chola's help to punish and suppress Kedah rebellion. In 1068, [[Virarajendra Chola]] launched a naval raid to help Srivijaya reclaim Kedah.&lt;ref name="Suvarnadwipa p.305"&gt;Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: Reflections on the Chola Naval Expeditions by Hermann Kulke, K Kesavapany, Vijay Sakhuja p.305&lt;/ref&gt; Virarajendra reinstated the Kedah king at the request of the Srivijayan Maharaja and Kedah accepted the Srivijayan sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Munoz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suvarnadwipa p.305"/&gt; After this the Chola ruler [[Kulothunga Chola I]] became the ruler of Srivijaya which is mentioned in the Song chronicles.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhism, Diplomacy, and Trade: The Realignment of India–China Relations 600-1400 by Tansen Sen p.234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The World of Khubilai Khan: Chinese Art in the Yuan Dynasty by James C. Y. Watt p.166&lt;/ref&gt; This peculiar event and the strange dynamic between Srivijaya and its former nemesis, the Cholas, has confused the Chinese court, that in their report mistakenly thought that the Chola was the vassal of Srivijaya.

Between 1079 and 1088, Chinese records show that Srivijaya sent ambassadors from Jambi and Palembang.&lt;ref name="MUNOZ 165"&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|title=Early Kingdoms |pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1079 in particular, an ambassador from Jambi and Palembang each visited China. Jambi sent two more ambassadors to China in 1082 and 1088.&lt;ref name="MUNOZ 165" /&gt; That would suggest that the centre of Srivijaya frequently shifted between the two major cities during that period.&lt;ref name="MUNOZ 165" /&gt; The Chola expeditions as well as the changing trade routes weakened Palembang, allowing Jambi to take the leadership of Srivijaya from the 11th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|title=Early Kingdoms |pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 12th century, a new dynasty called [[Mauli]] rose as the paramount of Srivijaya. The earliest reference to the new dynasty was found in [[Grahi inscription]] dated 1183 discovered in [[Chaiya]] ([[Grahi]]), Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula. The inscription bears the order of  Maharaja Srimat Trailokyaraja Maulibhusana Warmadewa to the ''bhupati'' (regent) of Grahi named Mahasenapati Galanai to make a statue of Buddha weight 1 ''bhara'' 2 ''tula'' with the value of 10 gold ''tamlin''. The artist that responsible for the creation of the statue is Mraten Sri Nano.

According to the Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] book ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Hirth]] and [[W.W. Rockhill]] ''[http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CADAL/B31403797/ Chao Jukua, His Work on the Chinese and Arab Trade in the Twelfth and Thirteenth centuries, entitled Chu-fan-chi]'' St Petersburg, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; written around 1225 by [[Zhao Rugua]], the two most powerful and richest kingdoms in the [[Southeast Asia]]n archipelago were Srivijaya and [[Java]] ([[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]), with the western part (Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java/[[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]]) under Srivijaya's rule and the eastern part was under Kediri's domination. It says that the people in Java followed two kinds of religions, namely [[Buddhism]] and the religion of [[Brahmins]] ([[Hinduism]]), while the people of Srivijaya followed [[Buddhism]]. The book describes the people of Java as being brave, short-tempered and willing to fight. It also notes that their favourite pastimes were [[cockfighting]] and pig fighting. The coin used as the currency then were made from a mixture of [[copper]], [[silver]], and [[tin]].
{{History of Thailand}}
''Zhu fan zhi'' also states that Java was ruled by a [[maharaja]] and included the following "dependencies": ''Pai-hua-yuan'' ([[Pacitan]]), Ma-tung (Medang), ''Ta-pen'' (Tumapel, now [[Malang]]), ''Hi-ning'' ([[Dieng Plateau|Dieng]]), ''Jung-ya-lu'' (Hujung Galuh, now [[Surabaya]]), ''Tung-ki'' (Jenggi, [[West Papua (Indonesian province)|West Papua]]), ''Ta-kang'' ([[Sumba]]), ''Huang-ma-chu'' ([[Papua (Indonesian province)|Southwest Papua]]), ''Ma-li'' ([[Bali]]), ''Kulun'' (Gurun, identified as Gorong or [[Sorong Regency|Sorong]] in [[West Papua (Indonesian province)|West Papua]] or an island in [[Nusa Tenggara]]), ''Tan-jung-wu-lo'' ([[West Kalimantan|Tanjungpura]] in Borneo), ''Ti-wu'' ([[Timor]]), ''Pingya-i'' ([[Banggai Island|Banggai]] in Sulawesi), and ''Wu-nu-ku'' ([[Maluku Islands|Maluku]]).&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|186–187}}  Additionally, Zhao Rugua said that Srivijaya "was still a great power at the beginning of the thirteenth century" with 15 colonies:&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Hirth and W.W.Rockhill, (1911), ''Chao Ju-kua, His Work on the Chinese and Arab Trade in the Twelfth and Thirteenth centuries, entitled Chu-fan-chi'', St Petersburg.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pong-fong'' ([[Pahang]]), ''Tong-ya-nong'' ([[Terengganu]]), ''Ling-ya-si-kia'' ([[Langkasuka]]), ''Kilan-tan'' ([[Kelantan]]), ''Fo-lo-an'' ([[Dungun]], eastern part of Malay Peninsula, a town within state of Terengganu),'' Ji-lo-t'ing'' ([[Cherating]]), ''Ts'ien-mai'' (Semawe, Malay Peninsula), ''Pa-t'a'' ([[Paka, Malaysia|Sungai Paka]], located in [[Terengganu]] of Malay Peninsula), ''Tan-ma-ling'' ([[Tambralinga]], ''Ligor or'' [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]], South [[Thailand]]), ''Kia-lo-hi'' (Grahi, ([[Krabi Province|Krabi]]) northern part of Malay peninsula), ''Pa-lin-fong'' ([[Palembang]]), ''Sin-t'o'' ([[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]]), ''Lan-wu-li'' ([[Lamuri]] at [[Aceh]]), ''Kien-pi'' ([[Jambi]]) and ''Si-lan'' ([[Cambodia]] or [[Ceylon]] (?)).&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|183–184}}&lt;ref name="Muljana" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Drs.

Srivijaya remained a formidable sea power until the 13th century.&lt;ref name="end" /&gt; According to Cœdès, at the end of the 13th century, the empire "had ceased to exist... caused by the simultaneous pressure on its two flanks of Siam and Java."&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|204,243}}

====Javanese pressure====
{{main|Pamalayu expedition}}
By the 13th century, [[Singhasari]] empire, the successor state of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] in Java, rose as a regional hegemon in maritime Southeast Asia. In the year 1275, the ambitious and able king [[Kertanegara]], the fifth monarch of Singhasari who had been reigning since 1254, launched a naval campaign northward towards the remains of the Srivijayan mandala.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|198}} The strongest of these Malay kingdoms was [[Jambi]], which captured the Srivijaya capital in 1088, then the [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya kingdom]], and the [[Temasek]] kingdom of Singapore, and then remaining territories. In 1288, Kertanegara's forces conquered much of [[Malays (ethnic group)|Melayu]] states includes Palembang, Jambi as well as much of Srivijaya during the [[Pamalayu expedition]]. The [[Padang Roco Inscription]] was discovered in 1911 near the source of Batang Hari river, Padangroco.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hendrik Kern]], 'De Wij-inscriptie op het Amoghapâça-beeld van Padang-tjandi (Midden-Sumatra) 1269 Caka', ''Tijdschrift voor Indische taal-, land- en volkenkunde,'' Uitgegeven door het Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen (TBG), 49, 1907, pp.159-171; also Hendrik Kern, 'De Wij-inscriptie op het Amoghapaca-beeld van Padang Candi (Midden-Sumatra) 1269 Caka', ''Verspreide Geschriften,'' The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, Vol. VII, 1917, pp.165-75.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription which was dated 1208 Saka (1286), tell that under the order of king [[Kertanegara]] of Singhasari, a statue of Amoghapasa [[Lokeshvara]] was transported from  Bhumijawa ([[Java]]) to Suvarnabhumi ([[Sumatra]]) to be erected at Dharmasraya. This gift has made the people of Suvarnabhumi rejoiced, especially their king [[Tribhuwanaraja|Tribhuwanaraja]]Tribhuwanaraja Mauliwarmmadewa.

In the year 1293, the [[Majapahit]] empire, the successor state of Singhasari, ruled much of Sumatra. Prince [[Adityawarman]] was given the power over [[Sumatera]] in 1347 by [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi]], the third monarch of [[Majapahit]]. A rebellion broke out in 1377 and was quashed by [[Majapahit]] but it left the area of southern [[Sumatera]] in chaos and desolation.

In the following years, sedimentation on the Musi river estuary cut the kingdom's capital off from direct sea access. This strategic disadvantage crippled the trade in the kingdom's capital. As the decline continued, [[Islam]] made its way to the [[Aceh]] region of Sumatra, spreading through contacts with [[Arab]] and [[India]]n traders. By the late 13th century, the kingdom of [[Pasai]], in northern Sumatra, converted to Islam. At the same time, Srivijayan lands in Malay Peninsula (now [[Southern Thailand]]) was briefly a [[tributary state]] of the Khmer empire and later the [[Sukhothai kingdom]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. The last inscription, on which a crown prince, [[Ananggavarman]], son of [[Adityawarman]], is mentioned, dates from 1374.

====Last revival efforts====
{{further|Sang Sapurba|Kingdom of Singapura}}
After decades of Javanese domination, there were several last efforts made by Sumatran rulers to revive the old prestige and fortune of Malay-Srivijayan Mandala. Several attempts to revive Srivijaya were made by the fleeing princes of Srivijaya.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} According to the [[Sejarah Melayu|Malay Annals]], a new ruler named [[Sang Sapurba]] was promoted as the new paramount of Srivijayan mandala. It was said that after his accession to [[Bukit Seguntang|Seguntang Hill]] with his two younger brothers, Sang Sapurba enters into a sacred covenant with Demang Lebar Daun the native ruler of Palembang.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sabrizain|p=[http://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/melaka2.htm The Tuah Legend]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly installed sovereign afterwards descended from the hill of Seguntang into the great plain of [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi river]], where he married Wan Sendari, the daughter of the local chief, Demang Lebar Daun. Sang Sapurba was said to have reigned in [[Minangkabau Highlands|Minangkabau lands]].

According to [[Visayan]] legends, in the 1200s, there was a [[resistance movement]] of Srivijayan datus aimed against the encroaching powers of the Hindu Chola and Majapahit empires. The datus migrated to and organized their resistance movement from the Visayas islands of the [[Philippines]] which was named after their Srivijayan homeland.&lt;ref name="Jovito S. Abellana 1960"&gt;Jovito S. Abellana, "Bisaya Patronymesis Sri Visjaya" (Ms., Cebuano Studies Center, ca. 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; 10 Datus, led by Datu Puti established a [[rump state]] of Srivijaya, called [[Madja-as]] in the Visayas islands.&lt;ref name="G. Nye Steiger 1929, p. 120"&gt;G. Nye Steiger, H. Otley Beyer, Conrado Benitez, ''A History of the Orient'', Oxford: 1929, Ginn and Company, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; 
This rump state waged war against the Chola empire and Majapahit and also raided China,&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/421631/raiding-china Jobers Bersales, ''Raiding China'' at Inquirer.net]&lt;/ref&gt; before they were eventually assimilated into a Spanish empire that expanded to the Philippines from Mexico.

In 1324, a prince of Srivijaya origin, Sri Maharaja Sang Utama Parameswara Batara Sri Tribuwana ([[Sang Nila Utama]]) founded the ancient [[Kingdom of Singapura]] (Temasek). Tradition mentioned that he is related to Sang Sapurba. He maintained control over Temasek for 48 years. He was recognised as ruler over Temasek by an envoy of the Chinese Emperor sometime around 1366. He was succeeded by his son Paduka Sri Pekerma Wira Diraja (1372–1386) and grandson, Paduka Seri Rana Wira Kerma (1386–1399). In 1401, the last ruler, Paduka Sri Maharaja [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]] was expelled from Temasek by the forces from Majapahit or [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]]. He later headed north and founded [[Sultanate of Malacca]] in 1402.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Buyers | first = Christopher | title = The Ruling House of Malacca&amp;nbsp;– Johor | url=http://www.royalark.net/Malaysia/malacca.htm | accessdate = 13 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sultanate of Malacca]] succeeded Srivijaya Empire as a Malay political entity in the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Alexanderll | first = James | title = Malaysia Brunei &amp; Singapore | publisher = [[New Holland Publishers]] |date=September 2006 | pages = 8  | isbn = 9781860113093 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = South and Southeast Asia, 500&amp;nbsp;– 1500 | encyclopedia = The Encyclopedia of World History | volume = 1 | pages = 138 | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and economy==

===Political administration===
[[File:Telaga Batu inscription.JPG|thumb|left|[[Telaga Batu inscription]] adorned with seven [[nāga]] heads on top, and a waterspout on the lower part to channel the water probably poured during ceremonial allegiance ritual.]]

The 7th century [[Telaga Batu inscription]], discovered in Sabokingking, Palembang, testifies to the complexity and stratified titles of the Srivijayan state officials. These titles are mentioned: ''rājaputra'' (princes, lit: sons of king), ''kumārāmātya'' (ministers), ''bhūpati'' (regional rulers), ''senāpati'' (generals), ''nāyaka'' (local community leaders), ''pratyaya'' (nobles), ''hāji pratyaya'' (lesser kings), ''dandanayaka'' (judges), ''tuhā an vatak'' (workers inspectors), ''vuruh'' (workers), ''addhyāksi nījavarna'' (lower supervisors), ''vāsīkarana'' (blacksmiths/weapon makers), ''cātabhata'' (soldiers), ''adhikarana'' (officials), ''kāyastha'' (store workers), ''sthāpaka'' (artisans), ''puhāvam'' (ship captains),  ''vaniyāga'' (traders), ''marsī hāji'' (king's servants), ''hulun hāji'' (king's slaves).&lt;ref&gt;Casparis, J.G., (1956), ''Prasasti Indonesia II: Selected Inscriptions from the 7th to the 9th Century A.D.'', Dinas Purbakala Republik Indonesia, Bandung: Masa Baru.&lt;/ref&gt;

During its formation, the empire was organised in three main zones — the estuarine capital region centred on Palembang, the Musi River basin which served as hinterland and source of valuable goods, and rival estuarine areas capable of forming rival power centres. These rival estuarine areas, through raids and conquests, were held under Srivijayan power, such as the Batanghari estuarine ([[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]] in Jambi). Several strategic ports also included places like [[Bangka Island]] (Kota Kapur), ports and kingdoms in Java (highly possible [[Tarumanagara]] and [[Kalingga]]), [[Kedah]] and [[Chaiya]] in Malay peninsula, and [[Lamuri]] and [[Pannai]] in northern Sumatra. There are also reports mentioning the Java-Srivijayan raids on Southern Cambodia (Mekong estuarine) and ports of [[Champa]].

After its expansion to the neighbouring states, the Srivijayan empire was formed as a collection of several [[Kedatuan|Kadatuan]]s (local principalities), which swore allegiance to the central ruling powerful Kadatuan ruled by the Srivijayan Maharaja. The political relations and system relating to its realms is described as a [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala model]], typical of that of classical Southeast Asian Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms. It could be described as federation of kingdoms or vassalised polity under a centre of domination, namely the central Kadatuan Srivijaya. The polity was defined by its centre rather than its boundaries and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing further administrative integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The relations between the central kadatuan and its member (subscribers) kadatuans were dynamic. As such, the status would shift over generations. Minor trading ports throughout the region were controlled by local vassal rulers in place on behalf of the king. They also presided over harvesting resources from their respective regions for export. A portion of their revenue was required to be paid to the king.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kee-Long|first=So|date=1998|title=Dissolving Hegemony or Changing Trade Pattern? Images of Srivijaya in the Chinese Sources of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries|jstor=20072047|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|volume=29|issue=2|pages=295–308|doi=10.1017/s0022463400007451}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were not allowed to infringe upon international trade relations, but the temptation of keeping more money to themselves eventually led foreign traders and local rulers to conduct illicit trading relations of their own.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolters|first=O. W.|date=1966|title=A Note on the Capital of Śrīvijaya during the Eleventh Century|jstor=1522654|journal=Artibus Asiae. Supplementum|volume=23|pages=225–239|doi=10.2307/1522654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources claim that the Champa invasion had weakened the central government significantly, forcing vassals to keep the international trade revenue for themselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to coercive methods through raids and conquests and being bound by ''pasumpahan'' (oath of allegiance), the royalties of each kadatuan often formed alliances through dynastic marriages. For example, a previously suzerained kadatuan over time might rise in prestige and power, so that eventually its ruler could lay claim to be the maharaja of the central kadatuan. The relationship between Srivijayan in Sumatra (descendants of Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa) and Sailendras in Java exemplified this political dynamic.

===Economy and commerce===
[[File:Buddhist Expansion.svg|thumb|right|Buddhism expansion from northern India to the rest of Asia, Srivijaya once served as a centre of Buddhism learning and expansion. This expansion followed trade routes of Silk Road inland and maritime route.]]
The main interest of Srivijayan foreign economic relation was to secure a highly lucrative trade agreement to serve a large Chinese market, that span from Tang to [[Song dynasty]] era. In order to participate in this trade agreement, Srivijaya involved in tributary relation with China, in which they sent numbers of envoys and embassies to secure the Chinese court's favour. The port of Srivijaya served as an important [[entrepôt]] in which valuable commodities from the region and beyond are collected, traded and shipped. [[Rice]], [[cotton]], [[indigo]] and [[silver]] from Java; [[aloe]]s, [[resin]], [[camphor]], [[ivory]] and rhino's tusks, [[tin]] and [[gold]] from Sumatra; [[rattan]], rare [[timber]], gems and precious stones from Borneo; exotic birds and rare animals, [[iron]], [[sappan]], [[sandalwood]] and rare spices from Eastern Indonesian archipelago; various spices of Southeast Asia and India; also Chinese [[ceramics]], [[lacquerware]], [[brocade]], fabrics, silks and Chinese artworks are among valuable commodities being traded in Srivijayan port. What goods were actually native to Srivijaya is currently being disputed due to the volume of cargo that regularly passed through the region from India, China, and Arabia. Foreign traders stopped to trade their cargo in Srivijaya with other merchants from Southeast Asia and beyond. It was an easy location for traders from different regions to meet as opposed to visiting each other directly. This system of trade has led researchers to conjecture that the actual native products of Srivijaya were far less than what was originally recorded by Chinese and Arabic traders of the time. It may be that cargo sourced from foreign regions accumulated in Srivijaya. The accumulation of particular foreign goods that were easily accessible and in large supply might have given the impression they were products of Srivijaya. This could also work in the opposite direction with some native Srivijayan goods being mistaken as foreign commodities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qin|first=Dashu|last2=Xiang|first2=Kunpeng|date=2011-01-01|title=Sri Vijaya as the Entrepôt for Circum-Indian Ocean Trade|url=http://journals.openedition.org/oceanindien/1379|journal=Études Océan Indien|language=fr|issue=46-47|pages=308–336|doi=10.4000/oceanindien.1379|issn=0246-0092}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the world of commerce, Srivijaya rose rapidly to be a far-flung empire controlling the two passages between India and China, namely the [[Sunda Strait]] from Palembang and the [[Malacca Strait]] from Kedah. Arab accounts state that the empire of the Srivijayan Maharaja was so vast that the swiftest vessel would not have been able to travel round all its islands within two years. The islands the accounts referred to produced camphor, aloes, sandal-wood, spices like [[clove]]s, [[nutmeg]]s, [[cardamom]] and [[cubeb]]s, as well as ivory, gold and tin, all of which equalled the wealth of the Maharaja to any king in India.&lt;ref name="Poesponegoro"&gt;Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro, [[Nugroho Notosusanto]], (1992), ''Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Jaman kuna'', PT Balai Pustaka, {{ISBN|979-407-408-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Srivijayan government centralized the sourcing and trading of native and foreign goods in “warehouses” which streamlined the trade process by making a variety of products easily accessible in one area.

Ceramics were a major trade commodity between Srivijaya and China with shard artifacts found along the coast of Sumatra and Java. It is assumed that China and Srivijaya may have had an exclusive ceramics trade relationship because particular ceramic shards can only be found at their point of origin, Guangzhou, or in Indonesia, but nowhere else along the trade route.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When trying to prove this theory, there has been some discrepancies with the dating of said artifacts. Ceramic sherds found around the Geding Suro temple complex have been revealed to be much more recent than previously assumed. A statuette found in the same area did align with Srivijayan chronology, but it has been suggested that this is merely coincidence and the product was actually brought to the region recently.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other than fostering the lucrative trade relations with India and China, Srivijaya also established commerce links with [[Arabia]]. In a highly plausible account, a messenger was sent by Maharaja [[Sri Indravarman]] to deliver a letter to [[Caliph]] [[Umar ibn AbdulAziz]] of [[Ummayad]] in 718. The messenger later returned to Srivijaya with a ''Zanji'' (a black female slave from [[Zanj]]), a gift from the Caliph to the Maharaja. Later, a Chinese chronicle made a mention of ''Shih-li-t-'o-pa-mo'' (Sri Indravarman) and how the Maharaja of ''Shih-li-fo-shih'' had sent the Chinese Emperor a ''ts'engchi'' (Chinese spelling of the Arabic ''Zanji'') as a gift in 724.&lt;ref name="Azra"&gt;{{cite book |last=Azra|first=Azyumardi|authorlink=Azyumardi Azra|title=Islam in the Indonesian world: an account of institutional formation|publisher=Mizan Pustaka|year=2006|isbn=979-433-430-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab writers of the 9th and 10th century, in their writings, considered the king of Al-Hind (India and to some extent might include Southeast Asia) as one of the 4 great kings in the world.&lt;ref name="Ancien Regime p.41"&gt;India and Indonesia During the Ancien Regime: Essays by P. J. Marshall, Robert Van Niel: p.41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Hind p.226"&gt;Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: Early Medieval India and the expansion Islam 7th-11th centuries by André Wink p.226&lt;/ref&gt; The reference to the kings of Al-Hind might have also included the kings of Southeast Asia; Sumatra, Java, Burma and Cambodia. They are, invariably, depicted by the Arabs writers as extremely powerful and being equipped with vast armies of men, horses and having tens of thousands of elephants.&lt;ref name="Ancien Regime p.41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Hind p.226"/&gt; They were also said to be in possession of vast treasures of gold and silver.&lt;ref name="Ancien Regime p.41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Hind p.226"/&gt; Trading records from the 9th and 10th centuries mention Srivijaya, but do not expand upon regions further east thus indicating that Arabic traders were not engaging with other regions in Southeast Asia thus serving as further evidence of Srivijaya’s important role as a link between the two regions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The currency of the empire were gold and silver coins embossed with the image of the sandalwood flower (of which Srivijaya had a trade monopoly on) and the word “vara,” or “glory,” in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thaibankmuseum.or.th/eng/museum107.php|title=The Evolution of Money - Srivijaya Money|website=www.thaibankmuseum.or.th|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other items could be used to barter with, such as porcelain, silk, sugar, iron, rice, dried galangal, rhubarb, and camphor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Chinese records, gold was a large part of Srivijaya. These texts describe that the empire, also referred to as “Jinzhou” which translates to “Gold Coast”, used gold vessel in ritual offering and that, as a vassal to China, brought “golden lotus bowls” as luxurious gifts to the Emperor during the Song Dynasty.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maritime Southeast Asia to 1500|last=Shaffer|first=Lynda|publisher=Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Arabic records that the profits acquired from trade ports and levies was converted into gold and was hidden by the King in the royal pond.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Thalassocratic empire===
[[File:Srivijayan Expansion.gif|thumb|right| Expansion of Srivijayan empire, started in Palembang in the 7th century, expanding throughout Sumatra, Malay Peninsula, Java, Cambodia, and receded as Malayu Dharmasraya in the 13th century.]]

The Srivijayan empire was a coastal trading centre and was a [[thalassocracy]]. As such, its influence did not extend far beyond the coastal areas of the islands of [[Southeast Asia]].

Srivijaya benefited from the lucrative maritime trade between China and India as well as trading in products such as [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] [[spice]]s within the Malay Archipelago. Serving as Southeast Asia's main [[entrepôt]] and gaining trade patronage by the Chinese court, Srivijaya was constantly managing its trade networks and, yet, always wary of potential rival ports of its neighbouring kingdoms. A majority of the revenue from international trade was used to finance the military which was charged with the responsibility of protecting the ports. Some records even describe the use of iron chains to prevent pirate attacks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The necessity to maintain its trade monopoly had led the empire to launch naval military expeditions against rival ports in Southeast Asia and to absorb them into Srivijaya's sphere of influence. The port of Malayu in Jambi, Kota Kapur in Bangka island, Tarumanagara and the port of Sunda in West Java, Kalingga in Central Java, the port of Kedah and Chaiya in Malay peninsula are among the regional ports that were absorbed within Srivijayan sphere of influence. A series of Javan-Srivijaya raids on the ports of [[Champa]] and [[Cambodia]] was also part of its effort to maintain its monopoly in the region by sacking its rival ports.
[[File:Borobudur ship.JPG|thumb|left|The image of a [[Borobudur ship]] on bas relief]]

The maritime prowess was recorded in a [[Borobudur]] bas relief of [[Borobudur ship]], the 8th century wooden double [[outrigger]] vehicles of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. The function of an outrigger is to stabilise the ship. The single or double [[outrigger canoe]] is the typical feature of the seafaring [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]]s vessels and the most likely type of vessel used for the voyages and explorations across [[Southeast Asia]], [[Oceania]], and [[Indian Ocean]]. The ships depicted at Borobudur most likely were the type of vessels used for inter-insular trades and naval campaigns by [[Sailendra]] and Srivijaya.

The Srivijayan empire exercised its influence mainly around the coastal areas of Southeast Asia, with the exception of contributing to the population of [[Madagascar]] 3,300 miles (8,000 kilometres) to the west.&lt;ref name="History of Madagascar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/madagascar/history |title=History of Madagascar |publisher=Lonely Planet.com|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The migration to Madagascar was estimated to have taken place 1,200 years ago around 830.&lt;ref name="Madagascar Founded By Women"/&gt;

==Culture and society==
Srivijaya-Palembang’s significance both as a center for trade and for the practice of Vajrayana Buddhism has been established by Arab and Chinese historical records over several centuries. Srivijaya' own historical documents, inscriptions in Old Malay, are limited to the second half of the 7th century. The inscriptions uncover the hierarchical leadership system, in which the king is served by many other high-status officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Srivijaya-empire|title=Srivijaya empire {{!}} historical kingdom, Indonesia|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex, stratified, cosmopolitan and prosperous society with refined tastes in art, literature and culture, with complex set of rituals, influenced by Mahayana Buddhist faith; blossomed in the ancient Srivijayan society. Their complex social order can be seen through studies on the inscriptions, foreign accounts, as well as rich portrayal in bas-reliefs of temples from this period. Their accomplished artistry was evidenced from a number of Srivijayan Art Mahayana Buddhist statues discovered in the region. The kingdom had developed a complex society; which characterised by heterogeneity of their society, inequality of social stratification, and the formation of national administrative institution in their kingdom. Some forms of metallurgy were used as jewelry, currency (coins), as status symbols—for decorative purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Joyce C.|last2=Hamilton|first2=Elizabeth G.|date=|title=The Transmission of Early Bronze Technology to Thailand: New Perspectives|url=|journal=Archaeometallurgy in Global Perspective|volume=|pages=805–852|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade allowed the spread of art to proliferate. Some art was heavily influenced by Buddhism, further spreading religion and ideologies through the trade of art. The [[Buddhist art]] and architecture of Srivijaya was influenced by the Indian art of the [[Gupta Empire]] and [[Pala Empire]]. This is evident in the Indian Amaravati style Buddha statue located in Palembang. This statue, dating back to the 7th and 8th centuries, exists as proof of the spread of art, culture, and ideology through the medium of trade.&lt;ref&gt;Thai Art with Indian Influences  by Promsak Jermsawatdi p.65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
According to various historical sources, a complex and cosmopolitan society with a refined culture, deeply influenced by Vajrayana Buddhism, flourished in the Srivijayan capital. The 7th century [[Talang Tuwo inscription]] described Buddhist rituals and blessings at the auspicious event of establishing public park. This inscription allowed historians to understand the practices being held at the time, as well as their importance to the function of Srivijayan society. Talang Tuwo serves as one of the world’s oldest inscriptions that talks about the environment, highlighting the centrality of nature in Buddhist religion and further, Srivijayan society. The [[Kota Kapur Inscription]] mentions Srivijaya military dominance against Java. These inscriptions were in the [[Old Malay]] language, the language used by Srivijaya and also the ancestor of [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language]]. Since the 7th century, the Old Malay language has been used in [[Nusantara]] (Malay-Indonesian archipelago), marked by these Srivijayan inscriptions and other inscriptions using old Malay language in the coastal areas of the archipelago, such as those discovered in Java. The trade contact carried by the traders at the time was the main vehicle to spread Malay language, since it was the language used amongst the traders. By then, Malay language become ''[[lingua franca]]'' and was spoken widely by most people in the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://melayuonline.com/ind/article/read/174/sriwijaya-dalam-telaah |title=Sriwijaya dalam Tela'ah |author=rmz |date=5 June 2007 |work= |publisher=Melayu Online |accessdate=1 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022105208/http://melayuonline.com/ind/article/read/174/sriwijaya-dalam-telaah |archive-date=22 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://melayuonline.com/eng/opinion/read/80/risen-up-maritime-nation |title=Risen Up Maritime Nation! |author=Bambang Budi Utomo |date=23 January 2008 |work= |publisher=Melayu Online |accessdate=1 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022091319/http://melayuonline.com/eng/opinion/read/80/risen-up-maritime-nation |archive-date=22 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, despite its economic, cultural and military prowess, Srivijaya left few archaeological remains in their heartlands in Sumatra, in contrast with Srivijayan episode in Central Java during the leadership of [[Sailendra]]s that produced numerous monuments; such as the [[Candi Kalasan|Kalasan]], [[Sewu]] and [[Borobudur]] ''mandala''. The Buddhist temples dated from Srivijayan era in Sumatra are [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]], [[Candi Muara Takus|Muara Takus]] and [[Bahal temple|Biaro Bahal]].

Some Buddhist sculptures, such as Buddha [[Vairocana]], Boddhisattva [[Avalokiteshvara]] and [[Maitreya]], were discovered in numerous sites in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula. These archaeological findings such as stone statue of Buddha discovered in [[Bukit Seguntang]], Palembang,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epalembang.com/lang/en/travel-tourism/landmarks/bukit-siguntang/|title=Bukit Siguntang «  ePalembang|publisher=|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avalokiteshvara from Bingin Jungut in Musi Rawas, bronze Maitreya statue of Komering, all discovered in South Sumatra.

Although each country put their own spin on an idea, it is evident how trade played a huge role in spreading ideas throughout Southeast Asia, especially in Srivijaya. The commonality of Srivijayan art exists in Southeast Asian sites, proving their influence on art and architecture across the region. Without trade, Srivijayan art could not have proliferated, and cross-cultural exchanges of language and style could not have been achieved.

After the bronze and Iron Age, an influx of bronze tools and jewelry spread throughout the region. The different styles of bangles and beads represent the different regions of origin and their own specific materials and techniques used .  Chinese artworks were one of the main items traded in the region, spreading art styles enveloped in ceramics, pottery, fabrics, silk, and artworks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Remnants of Buddhist shrines (stupas) near Palembang and in neighboring areas aid researchers in their understanding of the Buddhism within this society. Srivijaya and its kings were instrumental in the spread of [[Buddhism]] as they established it in places they conquered like [[Java]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], and other lands.&lt;ref name="Bentley"&gt;Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross Cultural Contacts and Exchange in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 72.&lt;/ref&gt; People making pilgrimages were encouraged to spend time with the monks in the capital city of [[Palembang]] on their journey to [[India]].&lt;ref name="Bentley"/&gt;

Other than Palembang, in Srivijayan realm of Sumatra, three archaeological sites are notable for their Buddhist temple density. They are [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]] by the bank of [[Batang Hari River]] in Jambi province; [[Muara Takus]] stupas in [[Kampar River]] valley of Riau province; and [[Bahal temple|Biaro Bahal]] temple compound in [[Barumun River|Barumun]] and [[Pannai]] river valleys, North Sumatra province. It is highly possible that these Buddhist sites served as ''[[sangha]]'' community; the monastic Buddhist learning centers of the region, which attracts students and scholars from all over Asia.
[[File:Candi Tinggi.jpg|thumb|right|Candi Tinggi, one of the temple within Muaro Jambi temple compound.]]
250 years before I Ching, scholar and traveler, Fa Xian, did not notice the heavy hand of Buddhism within the Srivijayan region. Fa Xian, however, did witness the maritime competition over the region and observed the rise of Srivijaya as a Thalassocracy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; I-Tsing stayed in Srivijaya for six months and studied Sanskrit. According to I-Tsing, within Palembang there were more than 1000 monks studying for themselves and training traveling scholars who were going from India to China and vice versa. These travelers were primarily situated in Palembang for long periods of time due to waiting for Monsoon winds to help further their journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=W.|first=T.|date=1897|title=Review of A Record of the Buddhist Religion, as Practised in India and the Malay Archipelago (A.

A stronghold of [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]], Srivijaya attracted pilgrims and scholars from other parts of Asia. These included the Chinese monk [[I Ching (monk)|I Ching]], who made several lengthy visits to Sumatra on his way to study at [[Nalanda University]] in India in 671 and 695, and the 11th century [[Bengal]]i Buddhist scholar [[Atisha]], who played a major role in the development of Vajrayana Buddhism in [[Tibet]]. [[I Ching]], also known as Yijing, and other monks of his time practised a pure version of Buddhism although the religion allowed for culture changes to be made.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross Cultural Contacts and Exchange in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 73.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also given credit for translating Buddhist text which has the most instructions on the discipline of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Magnin | first1 = Paul | year = 1995 | title = Messengers Of Light: Chinese Buddhist Pilgrims In India | url = | journal = UNESCO Courier | volume = 48 | issue = 5| page = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; I Ching reports that the kingdom was home to more than a thousand Buddhist scholars; it was in Srivijaya that he wrote his memoir of Buddhism during his own lifetime. Travellers to these islands mentioned that gold coins were in use in the coastal areas but not inland.

A notable Srivijayan and revered Buddhist scholar is [[Dharmakirti]] who taught Buddhist philosophy in Srivijaya and Nalanda. The language diction of many inscriptions found near where Srivijaya once reigned incorporated Indian Tantric conceptions. This evidence makes it clear the relationship of the ruler and the concept of bodhisattva—one who was to become a Buddha. This is the first evidence seen in the archaeological record of a Southeast Asian ruler (or king) regarded as a religious leader/figure.

One thing researchers have found Srivijaya to be lacking is an emphasis in art and architecture. While neighboring regions have evidence of intricate architecture, such as the Borobudur temple built in 750-850 AD under the Saliendra Dynasty, Palembang lacks Buddhist stupas or sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/592|title=Borobudur Temple Compounds|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this does not accurately reflect Buddhist influence.

==Relations with regional powers==
{{History of Singapore}}
Although historical records and archaeological evidence are scarce, it appears that by the 7th century, Srivijaya had established suzerainty over large areas of Sumatra, western Java and much of the Malay Peninsula. The oldest accounts of the empire come from Arabic and Chinese traders who noted in their travel logs the importance of the empire in regional trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WOLTERS|first=O. W.|date=1979|title=STUDYING ŚRĪVIJAYA|jstor=41492851|journal=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|volume=52|issue=2 (236)|pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its location was instrumental in developing itself as a major connecting port between China and the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Control of the [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca]] and [[Sunda Strait]]s meant it controlled both the [[spice trade|spice route]] traffic and local trade, charging a toll on passing ships. Serving as an entrepôt for Chinese, Malay, and Indian markets, the port of Palembang, accessible from the coast by way of a river, accumulated great wealth. Instead of traveling the entire distance from the Middle East to China, which would have taken about a year with the assistance of monsoon winds, it was easier to stop somewhere in the middle, Srivijaya. It took about half a year from either direction to reach Srivijaya which was a far more effective and efficient use of manpower and resources. A round trip from one end to Srivijaya and back would take the same amount of time to go the entire distance one way. This theory has been supported by evidence found in two local shipwrecks. One off the coast of Belitung, an island east of Sumatra, and another near Cirebon, a coastal city on the nearby island of Java. Both ships carried a variety of foreign cargo and, in the case of the Belitung wreck, had foreign origins.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Melayu Kingdom was the first rival power centre absorbed into the empire, and thus began the domination of the region through trade and conquest in the 7th through the 9th centuries. The Melayu Kingdom's gold mines up in the [[Batang Hari River]] hinterland were a crucial economic resource and may be the origin of the word [[Suvarnabhumi|Suvarnadvipa]], the Sanskrit name for Sumatra. Srivijaya helped spread the Malay culture throughout Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and western [[Borneo]]. Its influence waned in the 11th century. It was then in frequent conflict with, and ultimately subjugated by, the [[Java]]nese kingdoms of [[Singhasari]] and, later, [[Majapahit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =  Spuler | first = Bertold | authorlink = |author2=F.R.C Bagley  | title = The Muslim world : a historical survey, Part 4 | publisher = Brill Archive | location = | pages = 252 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VNgUAAAAIAAJ | doi = | isbn = 9789004061965 | year =  1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not the first time the Srivijayans had a conflict with the Javanese. According to historian Paul Michel Munoz, the Javanese [[Sanjaya dynasty]] was a strong rival of Srivijaya in the 8th century when the Srivijayan capital was located in [[Java]]. The seat of the empire moved to [[Muaro Jambi Regency|Muaro Jambi]] in the last centuries of Srivijaya's existence.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The [[Khmer Empire]] might also have been a [[tributary state]] in its early stages. The Khmer king, [[Jayavarman II]], was mentioned to have spent years in the court of Sailendra in Java before returning to Cambodia to rule around 790. Influenced by the Javanese culture of the Sailendran-Srivijayan ''mandala'' (and likely eager to emulate the Javanese model in his court), he proclaimed Cambodian independence from Java and ruled as [[devaraja]], establishing Khmer empire and starting the [[Angkor]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Groslier|first=Bernard Philippe|title=Indochine, Carrefour des Arts|publisher=École française d'Extrême-Orient|year=1961|location=Paris|url= |doi= |pages=124|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians claim that Chaiya in [[Surat Thani Province]] in southern Thailand was, at least temporarily, the capital of Srivijaya, but this claim is widely disputed. However, Chaiya was probably a regional centre of the kingdom. The temple of Borom That in Chaiya contains a reconstructed [[pagoda]] in Srivijaya style.&lt;ref name="Muljana" /&gt;
[[File:Borom That Chaiya.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Pagoda in Srivijaya style in Chaiya, Thailand]]
Wat Phra Boromathat Chaiya is highlighted by the pagoda in Srivijaya style, elaborately restored, and dating back to the 7th century. The Buddha relics are enshrined in the chedi or [[stupa]]. In the surrounding chapels are several Buddha statues in Srivijaya style, as it was labelled by [[Damrong Rajanubhab]] in his ''Collected Inscriptions of Siam'', which is now attributed to Wat Hua Wiang in Chaiya. Dated to the year 697 of the Mahasakkarat era (775), the inscriptions on a [[bai sema]] tells about the King of Srivijaya having erected three stupas at that site; which are possibly the ones at Wat Phra Borom That. However, it is also possible that the three stupas referred to are located at Wat Hua Wiang (Hua Wiang temple), Wat Lhong (Lhong temple) and Wat Kaew (Kaew temple) which are also found in Chaiya. After the fall of the Srivijaya, the area was divided into the cities ([[mueang]]) Chaiya, Thatong (now Kanchanadit) and Khirirat Nikhom.

Srivijaya also maintained close relations with the [[Pala Empire]] in [[Bengal]]. The [[Nalanda inscription]], dated 860, records that Maharaja Balaputra dedicated a monastery at the [[Nalanda|Nalanda university]] in the Pala territory.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|109}}  The relation between Srivijaya and the [[Chola dynasty]] of southern India was initially friendly during the reign of [[Raja Raja Chola I]]. In 1006, a Srivijayan Maharaja from the Sailendra dynasty, king [[Maravijayattungavarman]], constructed the [[Chudamani Vihara]] in the port town of [[Nagapattinam]].&lt;ref name="sastri219220"&gt;[[#Sastri|Sastri]], pp 219–220&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the reign of [[Rajendra Chola I]] the relationship deteriorated as the Chola Dynasty started to attack Srivijayan cities.&lt;ref&gt;Power and Plenty: Trade, War, and the World Economy in the Second Millennium  by Ronald Findlay, Kevin H. O'Rourke p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for this sudden change in the relationship with the Chola kingdom is not really known. However, as some historians suggest, it would seem that the Khmer king, Suryavarman I of the [[Khmer Empire]], had requested aid from Emperor [[Rajendra Chola I]] of the [[Chola dynasty]] against Tambralinga.&lt;ref name="Kenneth R. Hall 1975 pp. 318-336"&gt;Kenneth R. Hall (October 1975), "Khmer Commercial Development and Foreign Contacts under Sūryavarman I", Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient 18 (3), pp. 318-336, Brill Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; After learning of Suryavarman's alliance with Rajendra Chola, the Tambralinga kingdom requested aid from the Srivijaya king, Sangrama Vijayatungavarman.&lt;ref name="Kenneth R.

The conflict ended with a victory for the Chola and heavy losses for Srivijaya and the capture of Sangramavijayottungavarman in the Chola raid in 1025.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|142–143}}&lt;ref name="Kenneth R.

==Legacy==
[[File:Gadispalembang.jpg|thumb|left|The gilded costume of South Sumatran [[Gending Sriwijaya]] dance invoked the splendour of the Srivijaya Empire.]]
Although Srivijaya left few archaeological remains and was almost forgotten in the collective memory of the [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay people]], the rediscovery of this ancient maritime empire by Cœdès in the 1920s raised the notion that it was possible for a widespread political entity to have thrived in Southeast Asia in the past. 
Modern Indonesian historian has invoked Srivijaya not merely as a glorification of the past, but as a frame of reference and example of how ancient globalization, foreign relations and maritime trade, has shaped Asian civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kompas.id/baca/opini/2018/09/05/sriwijaya-dan-spirit-asia/|title=Sriwijaya dan Spirit Asia|first=Susanto |last=Zuhdi|date=2018-09-05|work=Kompas.Id|access-date=2018-09-06|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The most important legacy of Srivijayan empire was probably its language. For centuries, Srivijaya, through its expansion, economic power and military prowess, was responsible for the widespread of [[Old Malay]] throughout the Malay-Indonesian archipelago. It was the working language of traders and it was used in various ports, and marketplaces in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sea.lib.niu.edu/lang/malay.html Southeast Asia Digital Library: About Malay] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070616131617/http://sea.lib.niu.edu/lang/malay.html |date=16 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of Srivijayan had probably paved the way for the prominence of the present-day [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language]], now the official language of Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore and the unifying language of modern Indonesia.

According to the Malay Annals, the founder of [[Malacca Sultanate]] [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]] claimed to be a member of the Palembang Srivijaya lineage. That shows that even in the 15th century, the prestige of Srivijaya still remained and was used as a source for political legitimacy in the region.

Modern [[Indonesia]]n nationalists have also invoked the name of Srivijaya, along with [[Majapahit]], as a source of pride in Indonesia's past greatness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C-IZCcEuX30C&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Srivijaya+source+of+Indonesia+pride&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=Srivijaya%20source%20of%20Indonesia%20pride&amp;f=false/Strategic|title=Strategic Centrality|publisher=|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Srivijaya has become the focus of national pride and regional identity, especially for the people of [[Palembang]], [[South Sumatra]] province, and the [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay people]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="Awani-Malay"/&gt; For the people of Palembang, Srivijaya has also become a source of artistic inspiration for [[Gending Sriwijaya]] song and traditional dance.
[[File:Taman Purbakala Kerajaan Sriwijaya - Museum Sriwijaya.jpg|thumb|The Sriwijaya Museum in [[Srivijaya Archaeological Park]]]]
The same situation also happened in southern [[Thailand]], where Sevichai ({{lang-th|Srivijaya}}) dance was recreated in accordance with the art and culture of ancient Srivijaya. Today, the Srivijayan legacy is also celebrated and identified with Malay minority of [[Southern Thailand]]. In Thailand, the Srivijayan art was associated with Javanese art and architecture, which probably demonstrate the Sailendra influences over Java, Sumatra and the Peninsula. The examples of Srivijayan style temples are Phra Borom Mahathat at [[Chaiya]] constructed in Javanese style made of brick and mortar (c. 9th&amp;nbsp;– 10th century), Wat Kaew Pagoda at Chaiya, also of Javanese form and Wat Long Pagoda. The original Wat Mahathat at [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]] (a Srivijayan city) was subsequently encased by a larger [[Sri Lanka]] styled building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thailandsworld.com/index.cfm?p=87|title=Thailand's World :    The Srivijaya Kingdom in Thailand|publisher=|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, Srivijaya is a street name in many cities and has become synonymous with Palembang and South Sumatra. [[Srivijaya University]], established in 1960 in Palembang, was named after Srivijaya. Kodam Sriwijaya (a military commando area unit), PT Pupuk Sriwijaya (a fertiliser company), Sriwijaya Post (a Palembang-based newspaper), [[Sriwijaya Air]] (an airline), [[Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium]], and [[Sriwijaya F.C.]] (Palembang football club) were also all named to honour this ancient maritime empire. On 11 November 2011, during the opening ceremony of [[2011 Southeast Asian Games]] in Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium, Palembang, a colossal dance performance titled "Srivijaya the Golden Peninsula" was performed featuring Palembang traditional dances and also an actual sized replica of an ancient ship to describe the glory of the maritime empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2011/11/16/the-new-golden-peninsula-games/|title=The new Golden Peninsula Games|work=New Mandala|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indonesia.travel/en/news/detail/541/spectacular-opening-of-the-26th-sea-games-in-palembang|title=Wonderful Indonesia - Spectacular Opening of the 26th SEA GAMES in Palembang|publisher=|accessdate=25 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114180033/http://www.indonesia.travel/en/news/detail/541/spectacular-opening-of-the-26th-sea-games-in-palembang|archivedate=14 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular culture, Srivijaya has become the sources on inspiration for numbers of fictional feature films, novels and comic books. The 2013 film ''Gending Sriwijaya'' for example, took place three centuries after the fall of Srivijaya, telling the story about the court intrigue amidst the effort to revive the fallen empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Gending Sriwijaya (2013) | work = Film Indonesia | url = http://filmindonesia.or.id/movie/title/lf-g016-13-949954_gending-sriwijaya#.V7b_Lo9OKAg | language = Indonesian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Takana''' is a forum of prominent personalities with the objective of fighting sexual abuse in the [[Religious Zionism|National Religious]] sector in [[Israel]].

The forum came to the spotlight in February 2010 when it published a statement claiming that [[Rabbi]] [[Mordechai Elon]] was breaking his commitments to refrain from public activity, which followed complaints of sexual misconduct.

In 2008 the forum was involved in the [[Makor Rishon]] exposé of [[Megirot]] and its founder, Sylvia Dahari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1052023.html|title=Little woman, or big threat? |last=Rotem|first=Tamar|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The forum has been criticized for allowing the religious community to settle matters "in-house" rather than have alleged offenders subject to open public investigation.&lt;ref name="Levy crit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1151233.html|title=Sexual assault punished differently among religious, secular Jews |last=Levy|first=Gideon|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''That Vision Thing'''" is the second episode of season 3 in the television show ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. Written by [[Jeffrey Bell]] and directed by Bill L Norton, it was originally broadcast on October 1, 2001 on the [[Warner Brothers Network|WB]] [[television network|network]]. In "That Vision Thing", [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia's]] vision gift grows dangerous when it begins physically affecting her. She is on the verge of death when [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] discovers [[Wolfram &amp; Hart]] lawyer [[Lilah Morgan]] is sending the painful visions to force Angel to free a man imprisoned in an alternate dimension.

==Plot==
[[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce|Wesley]] and [[Charles Gunn (Angel)|Gunn]] eat take-out in the lobby and [[Winifred Burkle|Fred]] eats her food under the table until Wesley convinces her to come out, while Cordelia waits for her next vision. [[Wolfram &amp; Hart]] lawyer [[Wolfram &amp; Hart employees#Gavin Park|Gavin Park]] visits to inform them of the [[Hyperion Hotel]]'s building code violations. After Gavin leaves, Cordelia gets a vision about a coin with a hole in it and a clawed beast. In the bathroom where she recovers, Cordelia informs Wesley through the door that there are five claws, but leaves out that there are claw marks across her stomach. Angel makes arrangements for Cordelia to be taken home by Fred. He knows Cordelia's visions are getting worse, but she refuses to acknowledge how bad they are. Wesley, Angel, and Gunn leave to find the coin, ending up at a herb shop owned by an elderly couple who turn demonic when they ask about the coin. The gang knock out the couple and Angel finds the coin around the neck of the elderly man.

Gavin informs [[Lilah Morgan|Lilah]] that he's been moved into her department, and the two share bitter words about their approaches to dealing with Angel. At her apartment, Cordelia tries to force Fred to leave, but another violent vision leaves her with boils on her face. The whole gang meets at her place and she tries to describe her vision, but Angel is more interested in what's happening to her. They question why [[The Powers That Be (Angel)|The Powers That Be]] would inflict pain on their messenger. Wesley sends Angel to find the key that goes with the coin while [[Lorne (Angel)|Lorne]] tries to question the Powers That Be about their actions. Cordelia fears losing her visions, but is persuaded to try anyway.

Lilah has a young man wearing a fez sign some papers before meditating on a table. Removing his hat, the man reveals a split skull and exposed brain. As a result of the man's mental efforts, Cordelia gets hit with a massive vision about fire that flings the Host across the room and burns her face and limbs. From his contact with Cordelia, the Host realizes the visions originate from Wolfram &amp; Hart. Angel visits Lilah, who informs him that unless he uses the key and coin to free an "unfairly imprisoned" man from a hell dimension, the physical effects of Cordy's visions will worsen.

Back at the hotel, Wesley tells Angel the coin and key are items of good nature, so those holding and associated with the objects are likely good as well. Wesley points out that rescuing this man is going against Angel's mission. Angel inserts the key into the coin's hole, which transports him to a hell dimension where he encounters a demon guard protecting a large fiery cube surrounding the prisoner, who is constantly aflame and in agony. The guard, [[List of minor Angel characters#Skip|Skip]], is holding the prisoner in the fire with his will; he mentions that the prisoner is a particularly heinous monster who has earned such torment. Skip and Angel have a friendly conversation before they break into battle, where Skip is knocked unconscious, and the man is thus freed. Angel and the rest of the gang transport the prisoner to Lilah for the exchange. Lilah has Brain Man in the back of a limo work his magic to end Cordelia's suffering. A phone call to Fred at Cordelia's place confirms its success. The captive man is handed over to Wolfram &amp; Hart, then Angel kills Brain Man by throwing a piece of re-bar through the limo's window and the man's skull. Lilah turns around to find Angel right in her face, threatening to kill her if she goes after Cordelia again. At the hotel, Cordelia makes food and coffee for Angel as thanks for his work and Angel convinces her the guilt she feels for what happened is unnecessary. He'll deal with Wolfram &amp; Hart and the man he set free when it becomes necessary.

Meanwhile, in Central America, [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]] visits a Shaman, asking for help to get rid of her baby. She reveals that the father is a vampire. Using some of her blood and herbs, he tries to determine the baby's form and how it could exist in a vampire's body. Unfortunately, what she is carrying is something no one can rid her of, and she resolves that her last option is to seek help from the baby's father.

==Production==
===Writing===
"That Vision Thing" was the first ''Angel'' script written by [[Jeffrey Bell]], who went on to both write and direct many subsequent episodes. Bell, who was recruited from ''[[The X-Files]]'', included a reference to a creature he created for ''The X-Files'' episode "[[Alpha (The X-Files)|Alpha]]" called a "Wanshang Dhole" and came up with the demon jailer Skip,&lt;ref name=Cult&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.whedon.info/Jeff-Bell-Cult-Times-Magazine.html |title=Jeff Bell - Cult Times Magazine Interview |first=Deborah |last=M. |date=2003-12-17 |publisher=Cult Times Magazine Special Edition |issue=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  although he was originally called Bob. Played by actor [[David Denman]], Skip was renamed as a tribute to producer [[Skip Schoolnik]]&lt;ref name=Skip&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,274 |title=Skip Tracer |first=Kate |last=O'Hare |date=March 27, 2003 |accessdate=2007-12-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030416123950/http://tv.zap2it.com/sciencefiction/otherworlds.html?30790 |archivedate=2003-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly became a fan favorite. Executive producer [[David Greenwalt]] says, "People are insane for Skip. Not since Angel appeared on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy]]'' have I seen people go wild for a character like this." Greenwalt theorizes that their new special-effects shop Almost Human was partly responsible for the positive fan reaction.&lt;ref name=Zap2It&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7C71339%7C1%7C,00.html |title=Skip the Demon to Return to 'Angel' |first=Kate |last=O'Hare |date=October 18, 2001 |accessdate=2007-12-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040509103320/http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1%2C1002%2C271%7C71339%7C1%7C%2C00.html |archivedate=May 9, 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7C79168%7C1%7C,00.html |title=Almost Human: From Beneath They Devour |first=Kate |last=O'Hare |date=November 29, 2002 |accessdate=2007-12-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040509071024/http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1%2C1002%2C271%7C79168%7C1%7C%2C00.html |archivedate=May 9, 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Makeup artist Robert Hall explains that Bell "described Skip enough for us to get a cool feeling about what he could look like, but he wasn't really restrictive." Hall and the rest of Almost Human created the character in less than a week. "It was a series of cool, happy accidents," Hall says. "We went so totally extreme with the design, and David went so deadpan with the dialogue, and Jeff went so out there with the scene, that it all came together, accidentally."&lt;ref name=Skip /&gt;

===Acting===
Actress [[Charisma Carpenter]] says that although the visions aren't usually difficult to portray, the physical manifestation of the visions in this episode were "a little bit more challenging than I had anticipated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/angel/interviews/carpenter/page3.shtml |title=Interview with Charisma Carpenter: Visionary acting |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This episode marks David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter's 100th appearances as Angel and Cordelia Chase respectively.

This episode is [[Kal Penn|Kal Penn's]] second appearance in the Buffyverse; he previously appeared in the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer|Buffy]]'' episode "[[Beer Bad]]" as Hunt.

===Arc significance===
* This episode introduces [[List of minor Angel characters|Skip]], who plays a significant role in season four.
* The man Angel frees is [[List of minor Angel characters#Billy Blim|Billy Blim]], who reappears in "[[Billy (Angel)|Billy]]", later in the season.
*Cordelia asks Angel if bad things are happening to her because she's a bad person. This question echos episodes "[[Expecting (Angel episode)|Expecting]]" and "[[Rm w/a Vu]]" where she similarly wonders if her actions as a teenager are the cause for her suffering in those episodes.

==Reception==
The Futon Critic named it the 14th best episode of 2001, saying "The evolution of Cordelia has been one of the best things about this show as of late and this episode put out all the stops. Originally a Girl Friday to Angel, it's here we really see how far the character has come in the five years we've known her."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/reviews/2002/01/04/the-50-best-episodes-of-2001-number-20-11-12228/20020104_bestof2001/|title=The 50 Best Episodes of 2001 - #20-11|work=The Futon Critic|author=Brian Ford Sullivan|date=January 4, 2002|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thiru Edu-Vasippu''' is the [[India]]n [[ayyavazhi]] [[festival]] of melodiously reading the contents of [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]], celebrated in [[Pathis]] and [[Nizhal Thangals]]. It is read for periods of three days, five days, ten days or seventeen days. But in the Pathis, strictly, it was read for seventeen days and hence completed every year; [[Thiru Edu]] was scheduled according to that.

The part which was read on the first day was called [[Akilam one]] and the part read on day two was called [[Akilam two]], and so on. Since it was read for seventeen days it was scheduled up to Akilam seventeen.

The '''tomb of Jesse and Ruth''' (alt. Tomb of Ruth and Yishai) is an ancient structure located in the [[Tel Rumeida]] section of [[Hebron]]. In Palestinian tradition it is said to be  the Al-Arba'een mosque dating back to the times of [[Saladin]].&lt;ref&gt;Lior Lehrs, 'Political holiness: negotiating holy places in Eretz Israel/Palestine, 1937-2003,' in Marshall J. Breger, Yitzhak Reiter, Leonard Hammer  (eds.),[https://books.google.it/books?id=fs_FFvHDl5UC&amp;pg=PA242 ''Sacred Space in Israel and Palestine: Religion and Politics,''] Routledge, 2013  pp.228-249 p.242.&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure houses a small synagogue and receives visitors throughout the year, especially on the Jewish holiday of [[Shavuot]], in which the [[Book of Ruth]] is read.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Converts-pay-homage-to-Ruth-at-her-Hebron-tomb|title=Converts pay homage to Ruth at her Hebron tomb|website=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A medieval stone structure next to it has been excavated and is being used as a synagogue and study hall. Archaeologists postulate it could have been a Crusader fortress.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Medieval references ==
The identity of the location being the Tomb of Jesse is said to have been authenticated by [[Isaac Luria|Rabbi Isaac Luria]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} One of the earliest known references to the tomb comes from an unnamed student of the [[Nahmanides|Ramban]] who visited the site between 1289 and 1290. He wrote of visiting the "cave of Jesse's grave" on a hilltop near the Cave of Machpela and the ancient [[Old Jewish cemetery, Hebron|Jewish Cemetery of Hebron]]."{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} His words were reprinted in a collection of travel diaries of medieval Jewish travelers entitled ''Maasot Eretz Yisrael'' edited by bibliographer Abraham Yaari.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The Jewish traveler [[Yaakov HaShaliach]] mentions visiting the grave of Jesse, father of David in Hebron in the year 1235, but he does not specify the burial place. These comments were reprinted by the historian [[Julius Eisenstein]] in his 1927 book ''Otzar Masa'oth'', an anthology of itineraries by Jewish travelers.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 1522 Rabbi  [[Moses ben Mordecai Bassola]] wrote,  &lt;blockquote&gt;"at the summit of the mountain opposite Hebron is the burial place of Jesse, David's father. It has a handsome building with a small window that looks down on the burial cave. They say that once they threw a cat through the window and it emerged from the hole in the Cave of the Patriarchs. The distance between them is half a mile."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://courses.umass.edu/juda373/outlines/Basola,%20through%20p.148.pdf|title=In Zion and Jerusalem: The Itinerary of Rabbi Moses Basola (1521–1523)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132346/http://courses.umass.edu/juda373/outlines/Basola,%20through%20p.148.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Two [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] travelers wrote of the site: [[Samuel ben David of Crimea]] in 1642&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|jstor=3622420|title=Rabbi Elijah Afeda Baghi and the Karaite Community of Jerusalem on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Benjamin Ben-Eliyahu]] in 1785. Rabbi [[Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura|Ovadia of Bartenura]] (1445 - 1515) mentions praying there in his travel writings.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

''Yihus HaAvos V'Neviim (Lineage of the Patriarch and the Prophets), a book from 1537'' refers to the site as "a handsome building up on the mount, where Jesse, the King David's father is buried." It includes a drawing of the site, and notes an "ancient Israelite burial ground" nearby and Crusader courtyard.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Ottoman period ==

The first known written reference to the site housing the tomb of both Jesse and Ruth comes from the 1835 book ''Love of Jerusalem '' by [[Haim Horwitz]], referencing local oral traditions. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[Menachem Mendel]] of Kamenitz wrote in 1839,&lt;blockquote&gt;"Here I write of the graves of the righteous to which I paid my respects. Hebron – Described above is the character and order of behavior of those coming to pray at the Cave of ha-Machpelah. I went there, between the stores, over the grave of [[Avner ben Ner]] and was required to pay a Yishmaeli – the grave was in his courtyard – to allow me to enter. Outside of the city I went to the grave of Othniel ben Kenaz and, next to him, are laid to rest 9 students in niches in the wall of a shelter standing in a vineyard. I gave 20 pa’res to the owner of the vineyard. Also in the vineyard was a shelter with 2 graves: one of Jesse, father of David, and one of Ruth, the Moabite. I gave the vineyard owner 20 pa’res. I also went to a grave said to be that of the Righteous Rav, author of “Reshit Hokhma” [Rabbi Eliyahu DeVidas – 16th C Kabbalist and disciple of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero who died in Hebron."{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== British mandate period ==
In 1935 [[Zev Vilnay]] wrote that visitors were required to pay to access the site and that it once connected to the [[Tomb of Machpela]], but was filled in during the First World War and the entrance was now unknown.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Israeli archaeologist [[Jacob Pinkerfield]] (1897–1956) visited the site and wrote about it in his book ''The Synagogues in Eretz Yisra'el.''{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[Louis-Hugues Vincent]] (1872 - 1960), a French monk and archaeologist who lived in Jerusalem discusses the site in his two-volume work ''Hebron'' in 1923.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Post-1967 period==
In the 1970s Prof. Benzion Tavger (1930 - 1983) excavated the site and it was reopened to the public.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
The site was renovated in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/131616&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Treasure of Guarrazar''', [[Guadamur]], [[Province of Toledo]], [[Castile-La Mancha]], [[Spain]], is an  [[Archaeology|archeological]] find composed of twenty-six [[votive crown]]s and gold [[cross]]es that had originally been offered to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] by the [[Visigoth|Kings of the Visigoths]] in the seventh century in [[Hispania]], as a gesture of the orthodoxy of their faith and their submission to the ecclesiastical hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/pages/page_id18361_u1l2.htm Musée National du Moyen Âge, Hôtel de Cluny] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317142133/http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/pages/page_id18361_u1l2.htm |date=2010-03-17 }}: the Musée de Cluny conserves one of the votive crowns.&lt;/ref&gt; The most valuable of all is the votive crown of king [[Reccesuinth]] with its blue [[sapphire]]s from [[Sri Lanka]] and [[pendilia]].  Though the treasure is now divided and much has disappeared, it represents the best surviving group of Early Medieval Christian votive offerings.

The treasure, which represents the high point of Visigothic goldsmith's work,&lt;ref&gt;M.F. Guerra, T. Galligaro, A. Perea, "The treasure of Guarrazar : Tracing the gold supplies in the Visigothic Iberian peninsula", ''Archeometry'' '''49'''.1 (2007) pp. 53-74.&lt;/ref&gt; was dug between 1858 and 1861 in an orchard called ''Guarrazar'', in [[Guadamur]], very close to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Spain]]. The treasure was divided, with some objects going to the [[Musée de Cluny]] in [[Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |last=Fallow |first=Thomas Macall |wstitle=Crown and Coronet |volume=7 |page=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rest to the armouries of the [[Palacio Real]] in [[Madrid]] (today in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]). In 1921 and 1936, some items of the Treasure of Guarrazar were stolen and have disappeared.

Some comparable Visigothic [[filigree]] gold was found in 1926 at [[Torredonjimeno]] in the province of Jaén, consisting of fragments of votive crowns and crosses.&lt;ref&gt;Described and compared in Alicia Perea, "Visigothic filigree in the Guarrazar (Toledo) and Torredonjimeno (Jaén) treasures," ''Historic Metallurgy'' '''40'''.1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The jewellery found at Guarrazar is part of a continuous tradition of Iberian metalworking that goes back to prehistoric times. These Visigothic works were influenced heavily by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], but the techniques of gem encrustation found at Guarrazar were practised throughout the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic world]] and the style of the lettering was Germanic too. The crowns, however, were purely Byzantine in form and never meant to be worn. They were gifts to the church, to be hung above the altar.

The most valuable remaining pieces of the find are the two royal votive crowns: one of King [[Reccesuinth]] and one of King [[Suinthila]]. Both are made of gold, encrusted with sapphires, pearls, and other precious stones. Suinthila's was stolen in 1921 and never recovered. There are several other small crowns and many votive crosses. There were belts in the original find as well, but these have since vanished.

These findings, together with other of some neighbors and with the archaeological excavation of the Ministry of Public Works and the Royal Academy of History (April 1859), formed a group consisting of:

*  [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]: six crowns, five crosses, a pendant and remnants of foil and channels (almost all of gold).
*  [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]: a crown and a gold cross and a stone engraved with the Annunciation. A crown, and other fragments of a tiller with a crystal ball were stolen from the Royal Palace of Madrid in 1921 and its whereabouts are still unknown.
*  [[Musée de Cluny|National Museum of the Middle Ages]], [[Paris]]: three crowns, two crosses, links and gold pendants.

There were also many fragments of sculptures and the remains of a building, perhaps a Roman [[sanctuary]] or place of purification. After its dedication to Christian worship as a church or oratory, it housed a number of graves. A skeleton lying on a bed of lime and sand was found in the best preserved grave. Its well-preserved stone slate has a  Latin inscription that  mentions a priest named Crispín, dating from 693 (51st year of the reign of [[Égica]], year of the [[Sixteenth Council of Toledo]]). This slate is now in the National Archeological Museum of Spain in Madrid. The inscription on the Sónnica cross, a piece preserved in Paris, gives an indication about the name of this church.

According to some hypothesis, the monastery of Sancta Maria in Sorbaces of Guarrazar served as a hideout for the real treasure of the court, Toledo churches and monasteries to prevent their capture by the Muslims' invasion of Spain.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
{{Buddhism|terse=1}}
'''Women in Buddhism''' is a topic that can be approached from varied perspectives including those of [[theology]], [[history]], [[anthropology]] and [[feminism]]. Topical interests include the theological status of women, the treatment of women in Buddhist societies at home and in public, the history of women in Buddhism, and a comparison of the experiences of women across different forms of Buddhism. As in other [[religion]]s, the experiences of [[Buddhist]] women have varied considerably.

Scholars such as [[Bernard Faure]] and Miranda Shaw are in agreement that [[Buddhist studies]] is in its infancy in terms of addressing [[gender issues]]. Shaw gave an overview of the situation in 1994:&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the case of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism some progress has been made in the areas of women in early Buddhism, monasticism and Mahayana Buddhism. Two articles have seriously broached the subject of women in Indian tantric Buddhism, while somewhat more attention has been paid to Tibetan nuns and lay yoginis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaw|first=Miranda|title=Passionate Enlightenment: Women in Tantric Buddhism|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=New Jersey|year=1994|page=4|isbn=0-691-01090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However [[Khandro Rinpoche]], a female [[lama]] in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], downplays the significance of growing attention to the topic:&lt;blockquote&gt;
When there is a talk about women and Buddhism, I have noticed that people often regard the topic as something new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times and so many women are practicing the Dharma now. However, this is not the case. The female sangha has been here for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition. The roots are there, and we are simply re-energizing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rinpoche|first=Khandro|title=Blossoms of the Dharma: Living as a Buddhist Nun|editor=Thubten Chodron, Sylvia Boorstein|publisher=North Atlantic Books|year=1999|page=171|isbn=978-1-55643-325-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J6Ci86jyYq4C&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a present evaluation of women (and equality) in Buddhism, [[Masatoshi Ueki]] gave a diachronic textual interpretation of [[Buddhist texts]] from [[Early Buddhism]] to the [[Lotus Sutra]]. Ueki examined the terms 'male' and 'female' as not solely on the physical characteristics of each sex biologically but focusing on their functional roles in the respective society, namely 'male principle' and 'female principle,' and concluded that no difference is preached in the Shakyamuni's teachings regarding the enlightenment of woman.

The establishment of the male principle in equal measure with the female principle is the natural order of things. They should never exist in a mutually exclusive relationship. They should not be an emphasis on one at the expense of the other, for both are indispensable. ... will the establishment of the true self be a fact of reality for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Masatoshi|first=Ueki|title=Gender Equality in Buddhism|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|year=2001|page=191|isbn=0-8204-5133-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in Early Buddhism==
{{Early Buddhism}}
The founder of Buddhism, [[Gautama Buddha]], permitted women to join his [[Sangha (Buddhism)|monastic community]] and fully participate in it, although there were certain provisos or ''[[The Eight Garudhammas|garudhammas]]''. As Susan Murcott comments, "The nun's sangha was a radical experiment for its time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murcott|first=Susan|title=The First Buddhist Women: Translations and Commentary on the ''Therigatha''|publisher=Parallax Press|year=1991|page=4|isbn=0-938077-42-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Diana Paul, the traditional view of women in [[Early Buddhism]] is that they are inferior.&lt;ref name=WiB&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Buddhism: Images of the Feminine in Mahāyāna Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frJiFdKcHyMC|author1=Diana Y. Paul |author2=Frances Wilson |year=1985|chapter=Traditional Views of Women|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-05428-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rita Gross]] agrees that "a misogynist strain is found in early Indian Buddhism. But the presence of some clearly misogynist doctrines does not mean that the whole of ancient Indian Buddhism was misogynist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gross|first=Rita M.|title=Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis and Reconstruction of Buddhism|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1992|page=43|isbn=0-7914-1403-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4jg6EB--upsC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=%22Diana++Paul+%22+buddhism+university&amp;source=web&amp;ots=4Hb4J6LGoM&amp;sig=w0I2U2-8erW_bfzdc5N1LmQcUCM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA40,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although, there are statements in Buddhist scripture that appear to be misogynist, such as the presentation of women as obstructers of men's spiritual progress or the notion that a woman's birth is an inferior one with less opportunity for spiritual progress.  However, in societies where men have always retained access to authority and wider choices, a negative judgement on women's fate might be seen as simply reflecting the empirical political reality.  Furthermore, the religious literature is more likely to address men, and hence we find the Buddhist emphasis on renunciation of sensual desires expressed in terms of the male attachment to women more frequently than we find the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/916409066|title=Religions in the modern world : traditions and transformations|others=Woodhead, Linda,, Partridge, Christopher H.

==Women's Spiritual Attainment==
The various schools and traditions within Buddhism hold different views as to the possibilities of women's [[Spirituality|spiritual]] attainments.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027135930/http://www.geocities.com/zennun12_8/chanwomen.html Women in Zen Buddhism: Chinese Bhiksunis in the Ch'an Tradition] by Heng-Ching Shih&lt;/ref&gt; One significant strand emphasizes that in terms of spiritual attainment, women and men have equal spiritual capabilities and that women not only can, but also in many cases have, attained spiritual liberation. Such a perspective is found in a number of sources of different periods, including early Buddhist literature in the Theravāda tradition, Mahāyāna ''sūtras'', and tantric writings. There are stories of women and even children who attained enlightenment during the time of the Buddha. Furthermore, Buddhist doctrines do not differentiate between men and women since everyone, regardless of gender, status, or age, is subject to old age, illness, and mortality, thus the suffering and impermanence that mark conditioned existence apply to all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/916409066|title=Religions in the modern world : traditions and transformations|others=Woodhead, Linda,, Partridge, Christopher H. (Christopher Hugh), 1961-, Kawanami, Hiroko,|isbn=9780415858816|edition= Third|location=Abingdon, Oxon|oclc=916409066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist scholars have also noted than even when a woman's potential for spiritual attainment is acknowledged, records of such achievements may not be kept—or may be obscured by gender-neutral language or mis-translation of original sources by Western scholars.

===Limitations on Women's Attainments in Buddhism===
According to Bernard Faure, "Like most [[cleric]]al discourses, Buddhism is indeed relentlessly [[misogynist]], but as far as misogynist discourses go, it is one of the most flexible and open to multiplicity and contradiction."&lt;ref name="Bernard Faure 2003 3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RvO0vO575owC|page=3|title=The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender|author=Bernard Faure|year=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-09171-4|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Buddhist tradition, positions of apparently worldly power are often a reflection of the spiritual achievements of the individual. For example, any gods are living in higher [[six realms|realms]] than a human being and therefore have a certain level of spiritual attainment. [[Cakravartin]]s and [[Buddha]]s are also more spiritually advanced than an ordinary human being. However, as the Taiwanese [[Bhikshuni|nun]] Heng-Ching Shih states, women in Buddhism are said to have five obstacles, namely being incapable of becoming a Brahma King, ''Sakra'', King ''Mara'', Cakravartin or Buddha.&lt;ref name="geocities.com" /&gt; This is based on the statement of [[Gautama Buddha]] in the ''Bahudhātuka-sutta'' of the [[Majjhima Nikaya]] in the [[Pali Canon]] that it is impossible that a woman should be "the perfectly rightfully Enlightened One", "the Universal Monarch", "the King of Gods", "the King of Death" or "Brahmaa".&lt;ref name="budsas.org"&gt;[http://www.budsas.org/ebud/majjhima/115-bahudhatuka-e.htm Majjhima Nikaya III III. 2. 5. Bahudhaatukasutta.m-(115) The Discourse on Many Elements]&lt;/ref&gt;
Earlier limitations on attainment of [[Buddhahood]] by women were abolished in the [[Lotus Sutra]] which opened the direct path to enlightenment for women equally to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgi.org/buddhism/buddhist-concepts/the-enlightenment-of-women.html|title=The Enlightenment of Women|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nichiren]]" 
"Only in the Lotus Sutra do we read that a woman who embraces this sutra not only excels all other women but surpasses all men".&lt;ref&gt;Writing of Nichiren Daishonin, vol1.p 463 http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=463&amp;m&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and Buddhahood===
Although [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist]] texts such as the [[Cullavagga]] section of the [[Vinaya Pitaka]] of the [[Pali Canon]] contain statements from [[Gautama Buddha]], the founder of Buddhism, speaking to the fact that a woman can attain enlightenment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murcott|first=Susan|title=The First Buddhist Women: Translations and Commentary on the Therigatha|publisher=Parallax Press|year=1991|page=16|isbn=0-938077-42-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is also clearly stated in the ''Bahudhātuka-sutta'' that there could never be a female [[Buddha]].

In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, the modern school based on the [[Buddhist philosophy]] of the earliest dated texts, [[Buddhahood]] is a rare event. The focus of practice is primarily on attaining [[Arhat]]ship and the [[Pali Canon]] has examples of both male and female Arhats who attained [[nirvana]]. [[Yasodharā]], the former wife of [[Buddha Shakyamuni]], mother of his son [[Rahula]], is said to have become an [[arhat]] after having joined the [[Bhikkhuni]] order of Buddhist nuns. In [[Mahayana]] schools, Buddhahood is the universal goal for Mahayana practitioners. The [[Mahayana sutras]] maintains that a woman can become enlightened, only not in female form. For example, the ''Bodhisattvabhūmi'', dated to the 4th Century, states that a woman about to attain enlightenment will be reborn in the male form. According to Miranda Shaw, "this belief had negative implications for women insofar as it communicated the insufficiency of the female body as a locus of enlightenment".&lt;ref name="WITB p.27"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaw|first=Miranda|title=Passionate Enlightenment: Women in Tantric Buddhism|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=New Jersey|year=1994|page=27|isbn=0-691-01090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Theravada suttas state that it is impossible for a woman to be a bodhisattva, which is someone on their way to Buddhahood. A bodhisattva can be a human, animal, serpent, or a god, but never a woman.&lt;ref name="Appleton, Naomi 2011"&gt;Appleton, Naomi. "In the footsteps of the Buddha? women and the Bodhisatta path Theravāda Buddhism." Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion 27, no. 1 (March 1, 2011): 33-51.  {{jstor|10.2979/jfemistudreli.27.1.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; These suttas do not deny women to become awakened, but they are unable to lead a Buddhist community. If the aspiration to Buddhahood has been made and a Buddha of the time confirms it, it is impossible to be reborn as a woman. An appropriate aim is for women to aspire to be reborn as male. They can become a male by moral actions and sincere aspiration to maleness. Being born a female is a result of bad karma.&lt;ref name="Appleton, Naomi 2011"/&gt;

However, the Jataka tales (stories of the Buddha's past lives as a bodhisattva within the Theravada cannon) mention that the Buddha spent one of his past lives as a princess. This is directly contradictory to the assertion that a bodhisattva cannot be born a female.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/pdf/5-personen/analayo/buddha-princess.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of female Buddhas can be found in the [[tantra|tantric]] iconography of the [[Vajrayana]] practice path of Buddhism. Sometimes they are the consorts of the main [[yidam]] of a meditation [[mandala]] but Buddhas such as [[Vajrayogini]], [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] and [[Simhamukha]] appear as the central figures of tantric [[sadhana]] in their own right.&lt;ref name="WITB p.27" /&gt; Vajrayana Buddhism also recognizes many female [[yogini]] practitioners as achieving the full enlightenment of a [[Buddha]], Miranda Shaw as an example cites sources referring to "Among the students of the adept [[Naropa]], reportedly two hundred men and one thousand women attained complete enlightenment".&lt;ref name="WITB p.27" /&gt; [[Yeshe Tsogyal]], one of the five [[vajrayana|tantric]] consorts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yoniversum.nl/dakini/padma5.html The Five Consorts]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Padmasambhava]] is an example of a woman ([[Yogini]]) recognized as a female Buddha in the Vajrayana tradition. According to [[Karmapa]] [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] however Tsogyel has attained [[Buddhahood]] in that very life. On the website of the [[Karmapa]], the head of the Karma [[Kagyu]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], it is stated that Yeshe Tsogyal—some thirty years before transcending worldly existence—finally emerged from an isolated [[spiritual retreat|meditation retreat]], (c.796-805 AD), as "a fully enlightened Buddha"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/historicalsaints/princess-yeshe-tsogyal.htm Yeshe Tsogyal, Princess Of Karchen]&lt;/ref&gt; (samyak-saṃbuddha){{citation needed|date=December 2008}}.

There are predictions from Sakyamuni Buddha to be found in the thirteenth chapter of the [[Mahayana]] [[Lotus Sutra]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhistdoor.com/OldWeb/resources/sutras/lotus/sources/contents.htm ''Lotus sutra'' including chapter thirteen] Translated by The Buddhist Text Translation Society in USA)&lt;/ref&gt; referring to future attainments of [[Mahapajapati]] and [[Yasodharā]].

In the 20th Century [[Tenzin Palmo]], a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] [[bhikshuni|nun]] in the [[Drukpa Kagyu|Drukpa]] Lineage of the [[Kagyu]] school, stated "I have made a vow to attain [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|Enlightenment]] in the female form—no matter how many lifetimes it takes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackenzie|first=Vicki|title=Cave in the Snow|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=Great Britain|year=1998|page=5|isbn=0-7475-4389-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female Tulku Lineages===
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
In the fifteenth century CE, Princess Chokyi-dronme (Wylie: ''Chos-kyi sgron-me'') was recognized as the embodiment of the [[yidam|meditation deity]] and female Buddha in the [[Vajrayana]] tradition, [[Vajravarahi]]. Chokyi-dronme became known as Samding [[Dorje Pakmo|Dorje Phagmo]] (Wylie: ''bSam-lding rDo-rje phag-mo'') and began a line of female [[tulku]]s, reincarnate [[lama]]s. At present, the twelfth of this line lives in Tibet.

Another female tulku lineage, that of Shugseb Jetsun Rinpoche (Wylie: ''Shug-gseb rJe-btsun Rin-po-che'') (c. 1865 – 1951),&lt;ref name="bookrags.com"&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/ani-lochen-eorl-01/Ani Lochen (c. 1865 – 1951) Ani Lochen (c. 1865 – 1951)]&lt;/ref&gt; began in the late nineteenth century CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/approaching_buddhism/world_today/summary_report_2007_international_c/part_3.html Study Buddhism, Summary Report]&lt;/ref&gt; While she received teachings of all the Tibetan schools, Shugseb Jetsun Rinpoche was particularly known for holding a [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of [[Chöd]], the meditation practice of offering one's own body for the benefit of others.&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/lhamo/4ordin.htm WAiB Pages Resources on Women's Ordination]&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the twentieth century, Shugsheb Jetsun Rinpoche—also called Ani Lochen Chönyi Zangmo—founded the Shuksep or Shugsep (Wylie: ''shug gseb'') nunnery located thirty miles from Lhasa on the slopes of Mount Gangri Thökar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Shuksep_Nunnery Shuksep Nunnery]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Lochen_Ch%C3%B6nyi_Zangmo Lochen Chönyi Zangmo]&lt;/ref&gt; It became one of the largest and most famous nunneries in Tibet.&lt;ref name="bookrags.com" /&gt; Shugsep Nunnery, part of the [[Nyingma]] school, has been re-established in exile in Gambhir Ganj, India. The nuns of Shugsep continue their practices, including [[Longchen Nyingtig]] and [[Chöd]].&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com" /&gt;

==Buddhist Ordination of Women==
{{Main|Ordination of women in Buddhism}}
[[Gautama Buddha]] first [[ordination of women|ordained women]] as [[nun]]s five years after his enlightenment and five years after first ordaining men into the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]. The first [[bhikkhuni|Buddhist nun]] was his aunt and foster mother [[Mahapajapati Gotami]]. Bhikkhunis have to follow the eight rules of respect, which are [[vows]] called [[The Eight Garudhammas]]. According to Peter Harvey "The Buddha's apparent hesitation on this matter is reminiscent of his hesitation on whether to teach at all," something he only does after persuasion from various [[deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Peter|title=An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|page=384|isbn=978-0-521-55640-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CTSz3EVRpoC&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ordination of women in Buddhism is and has always been practiced in some Buddhist regions, such as East Asia, is being revived in some countries such as [[Sri Lanka]], and is newly beginning in some Western countries to which Buddhism has recently spread, such as the United States.

==Family Life in Buddhism==
In the Anguttara Nikaya (5:33), Buddha tells future wives that they should be obedient to their husbands, please them, and not make them angry through their own desires. Furthermore, the Buddha offers advice to married women in the Anguttara Nikaya (7:59; IV 91-94), from the Pali (Theravada) canon, where he tells of [[Sujata and seven types of wives|seven types of wives]]—the first three types are destined for unhappiness, while the last four, as they are imbued with long term self-control, are destined to be happy. These latter wives are characterised as caretakers (motherly-wife), companions (friend-wife) and submissives (sister-wife and slave-wife)—the Buddha thus endorsed a variety of types of wives within marriage.

According to Diana Paul, Buddhism inherited a view of women whereby if they are not represented as mothers then they are portrayed as either lustful temptresses or as evil incarnate.&lt;ref name=WiB/&gt;

===Motherhood===
The status of motherhood in Buddhism has also traditionally reflected the Buddhist perspective that [[dukkha]], or suffering, is a major characteristic of human existence. In her book on the [[Therigatha]] collection of stories of women [[arhats]] from the [[Pali Canon]], Susan Murcott states: "Though this chapter is about motherhood, all of the stories and poems share another theme—grief. The mothers of this chapter were motivated to become Buddhist nuns by grief over the death of their children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murcott|first=Susan|title=The First Buddhist Women: Translations and Commentary on the ''Therigatha'' |publisher=Parallax Press|year=1991|page=74|isbn=0-938077-42-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RtIKAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=murcott&amp;dq=murcott&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, motherhood in [[Early Buddhism]] could also be a valued activity in its own right. [[Queen Maya]], the mother of [[Gautama Buddha]], the founder of Buddhism, had a certain following, especially in [[Lumbini]], where she gave birth to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/nepal/lumbini.htm Temple of Mahadevi at Lumbini]&lt;/ref&gt; Since Maya died some days after his birth, Gautama Buddha was brought up by a fostermother, his mother's sister [[Mahapajapati]], who also had two children of her own. She became the first Buddhist nun. Both of her children, her son [[Nanda]] and her daughter [[Nanda (Buddhist nun)|Sundari Nanda]] joined the Buddhist [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] of monastics. The wife of Gautama Buddha, [[Yasodhara]], was the mother of one son named [[Rahula]], meaning "fetter", who became a Buddhist monk at the age of seven and Yasodhara also eventually became a nun.

One of the attractions for women in [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism of following the path of a [[yogini]] rather than that of a [[bhikkhuni]] nun was the opportunity to practice amidst family life with a husband or spiritual consort and possibly have children. Also Yoginis -unlike nuns- were not obliged to shave their hair. [[Machig Labdrön]] followed such a path, living in a monastery for a while but later leaving to unite with [[Topabhadra]] as her consort. According to Machig's [[namthar]] he cared for the children while she practiced and taught. Some of Machig's children followed her on the spiritual path, becoming accomplished yogins themselves. [[Tsultrim Allione]], a recognised emanation of Machig Labdron, herself was a nun for four years but left to marry and have children. She has spoken of the contribution motherhood has made to her practice:&lt;blockquote&gt;
...in Buddhism the image of the mother as the embodiment of compassion is used a lot. She'll do anything for the children. As a mother I felt that depth of love and commitment and having somebody who I really would give my own life for—it was very powerful to have that kind of relationship. I also felt that I didn't really grow up until I had my children. There were ways that maturity was demanded of me and having children brought forth that maturity. So I wouldn't say my children were an inspiration in the sense of what I thought would have been a spiritual inspiration before I had children. More so I think meeting the challenges of motherhood with what I had learned made my practice very rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taramandala.com/Article_Mothering.htm |title=On Mothering: An Interview with Tsultrim Allione |accessdate=2008-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009010407/http://taramandala.com/Article_Mothering.htm |archivedate=October 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Romantic Love, Sexual Conduct and Marriage===
{{See also|Sexual misconduct}}
In general, "While Buddhism regards the celibate monastic life as the higher ideal, it also recognizes the importance of marriage as a social institution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damien Keown |author2=Stephen Hodge |author3=Paola Tinti |title=A Dictionary of Buddhism|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2003|page=174|isbn=978-0-19-860560-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KE56vyhOHGsC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some guidelines for marriage are offered. Although [[Buddhist]] practice varies considerably among its various schools, [[marriage]] is one of the few concepts specifically mentioned in the context of [[Śīla]], the Buddhist formulation of core facets of [[spiritual discipline]]. The fundamental code of [[Buddhist ethics]], [[The Five Precepts]] contains an admonishment against [[sexual misconduct]], although what constitutes misconduct from the perspective of a particular [[schools of Buddhism|school of Buddhism]] varies widely depending on the local [[culture]].

In [[Early Buddhism]], the [[Sigalovada Sutta]] of the [[Digha Nikaya]] in the [[Pali Canon]] describes the respect that one is expected to give to one's spouse. However, since the ideal of Early Buddhism is [[Nekkhamma|renunciation]], it can be seen from examples such as the story of the monk [[Nanda (Buddhism)|Nanda]] and his wife Janapada Kalyāni that striving for the [[wikt:bliss|bliss]] of [[Nirvana]] is valued above romantic love and marriage. Despite having married her just that day, encouraged by his cousin [[Gautama Buddha]], Nanda left his wife to become a [[bhikkhu]] in the Buddhist [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. In stories like this from the Pali Canon, romantic love is generally perceived as part of attachment to [[samsara]], the endless cycle of [[rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.budsas.org/ebud/rdbud/rdbud-02b.htm Great Male Disciples—Part B / 15. Nanda] by Radhika Abeysekera&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Murcott has pointed out that Early Buddhist attitudes to romantic love and marriage generally reflect the [[Brahman]]ic ideals of India at the time... including the recent rise of the renunciate ideal and the associated decline in the status of romantic love and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murcott|first=Susan|title=The First Buddhist Women: Translations and Commentary on the Therigatha|publisher=Parallax Press|year=1991|page=95|isbn=0-938077-42-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, a sexual relationship with a consort is seen in a technical way as being a spiritual practice in [[anuttarayoga tantra]] intended to allow the practitioners to attain realizations and attain [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. The union of tantric consorts is depicted in the [[yab-yum]] iconography of [[yidam|meditation deities]].

==Views of Religious Leaders==

=== Dalai Lama ===
The [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] spoke at a conference on Women in Buddhism at the [[University of Hamburg]] in 2007:
{{quote|Warfare has traditionally been carried out primarily by men, since they seem better physically equipped for aggressive behavior. Women, on the other hand, tend to be more caring and more sensitive to others' discomfort and pain. Although men and women have the same potentials for aggression and warm-heartedness, they differ in which of the two more easily manifests. Thus, if the majority of world leaders were women, perhaps there would be less danger of war and more cooperation on the basis of global concern – although, of course, some women can be difficult! I sympathize with feminists, but they must not merely shout. They must exert efforts to make positive contributions to society.&lt;ref name="StudyBuddhism.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/approaching_buddhism/world_today/summary_report_2007_international_c/part_4.html#n063b0e55a12ff6f34 |title=A Summary Report of the 2007 International Congress on the Women's Role in the Sangha: Bhikshuni Vinaya and Ordination Lineages – Part Four: Day Three and Final Comments by His Holiness |publisher=StudyBuddhism.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

In 2009, at the [[National Civil Rights Museum]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] he said: "I call myself a [[feminist]]. Isn't that what you call someone who fights for [[women's rights]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conniff|first=Tamara|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tamara-conniff/the-dalai-lama-proclaims_b_297285.html|title=The Dalai Lama Proclaims Himself a Feminist: Day Two of Peace and Music in Memphis|publisher=www.huffingtonpost.com|date=23 September 2009|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also said that by nature, women are more compassionate "based on their biology and ability to nurture and birth children." He called on women to "lead and create a more compassionate world," citing the good works of nurses and mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tamara-conniff/the-dalai-lama-proclaims_b_297285.html |title=Tamara Conniff: The Dalai Lama Proclaims Himself a Feminist: Day Two of Peace and Music in Memphis |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 23 September 2009|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 he said that the next Dalai Lama could possibly be a woman, remarking "If a woman reveals herself as more useful the lama could very well be reincarnated in this form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1571850/Dalai-Lama-says-successor-could-be-a-woman.html |title=Dalai Lama says successor could be a woman |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2007-12-07 |accessdate=2010-11-19 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 he stated that "twenty or thirty years ago", when discussing whether a woman could be a Dalai Lama in the future, he said yes but "I also said half-jokingly that if the Dalai Lama's reincarnation is female, she must be very attractive. The reason is so that she will have more influence on others. If she is an ugly female, she won't be very effective, will she?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with the Dalai Lama about the Full Ordination of Women|url=http://info-buddhism.com/Interview_Dalai_Lama_about_the_Full_Ordination_of_Women.html|publisher=info-buddhism.com|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 2014 interview with [[Larry King]] when asked if he thought we will ever see a female Dalai Lama he stated "Yes! That's very possible." he recalled telling a reporter in Paris many years ago that it is possible mentioning that there are some female Lama's in history dating "...six or seven centuries ago, so it is nothing new." He then recalled joking with the reporter, "If female Dalai Lama come, that female must be very, very attractive. [It's] More useful"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Female Dalai Lama?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoeDpP_GHbI|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=27 February 2014|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalai Lama Says More Women as Leaders Might Lead to Less Violent World|url=http://www.worldreligionnews.com/religion-news/buddhism/dalai-lama-says-more-women-as-leaders-might-lead-to-less-violent-world|publisher=World Religion News|date=16 July 2015|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 he repeated this anecdote during an interview with the [[BBC]] on refugees. When asked if the Dalai Lama could be a woman he answers "Yes". Recalling again an interview in Paris of the possibility "I mentioned, Why not? The female biologically [has] more potential to show affection and compassion...therefore I think female[s] should take more important role and then - I told the reporter - if a female does come her face should be very, very attractive." The interviewer Clive Myrie then asked if a female Dalai Lama must be attractive, he followed up, "I mean. If female Dalai Lama come, then that female must be attractive. Otherwise not much use." Myrie replied "You're joking, I'm assuming. Or you're not joking?" to which The Dalai Lama insisted "No. True!". The Dalai Lama then pointed to his own face, stating that some people think he is very attractive and continued to laugh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalai Lama: Do not reject refugees because they are Muslim|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34316578|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=21 September 2015|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalai Lama Says If Successor Is Female, She Must Be Very Attractive |url=http://www.tricycle.com/blog/dalai-lama-says-if-successor-female-she-must-be-very-attractive|publisher=[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]]|date=22 September 2015|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist feminism==
{{Main|Buddhist feminism}}
[[Buddhist feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and [[social status]] of women within Buddhism. It is an aspect of [[feminist theology]] which seeks to advance and understand the [[Gender equality|equality]] of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Buddhist perspective. The Buddhist feminist [[Rita Gross]] describes Buddhist feminism as "the radical practice of the co-humanity of women and men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism|last= Gross|first= Rita M.|authorlink= |year= 1992|publisher= [[State University of New York Press]]|location= Albany, New York|isbn= 0-7914-1403-5|page= 127|pages= |accessdate=October 7, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3eurUjHo1IC&amp;pg=PA127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6719">'''Yogi Nath''' is a related group of monks which emerged around the 13th-century. They are sometimes called ''Jogi'' or simply ''Yogi'', and are known for a variety of siddha yoga practices.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p308"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones |author2=James D. Ryan |title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC |date=2006 |publisher=Infobase |isbn=978-0-8160-7564-5 |pages=308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their tradition is known as [[Nath]] [[Sampradaya]].&lt;ref&gt;AK Banerjea (1983), Philosophy of Gorakhnath with Goraksha-Vacana-Sangraha, {{ISBN|978-8120805347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The yogis were primarily associated with the Yogic-traditions promoted by the great [[Nath]] saints, e.g. [[Matsyendranath]], [[Gorakshanath]], Chauranginath etc. [[Hatha yoga]] is considered as the prominent part of those traditions promoted by these great [[Nath]] masters. The Nath [[Sampradaya]] is considered as a development of the earlier [[Siddha]] or [[Avadhuta]] Sampradaya,&lt;ref name=Despande&gt;Deshpande, M.N. (1986). ''The Caves of Panhale-Kaji''. New Delhi: Archaeological Survey of India, Government of India.&lt;/ref&gt; an ancient lineage of spiritual masters. The Nath yogis are classical followers of Shaivism.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p308"/&gt;

== Organization ==

The principles of Yoga philosophy of Nath tradition are stated in various books e.g. Gorakshagita, Goraksha Paddhati, Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati, Amaraugha Sasana, Amaraugha Prabodha, Mahartha Manjari, Gheranda Samhita, etc., all written in Sanskrit. Hatha yoga is a holistic path of yoga which includes disciplines, postures (asana), purification procedures (shatkriya), gestures (mudra), breathing (pranayama), meditation (dhyana), samadhi.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

The Nath tradition is a syncretic [[Yoga]] and [[Vedanta]] schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] based Shaiva tradition, that reveres Shiva and [[Dattatreya]]. Its founding is attributed to the ideas of [[Matsyendranath]] and [[Gorakshanath]], developed further with an additional seven other Siddha Yoga Gurus called "Naths" (literally, lords).&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p308"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones |author2=James D. Ryan |title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC |date=2006 |publisher=Infobase |isbn=978-0-8160-7564-5 |pages=308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nath Yogi ''sampradaya'' and monastic organizations grew starting with the 13th century,&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p308"/&gt; with its matha headquarters in [[Gorakhpur]], Uttar Pradesh. Many of their mathas are found in the northern, central and western states of India particularly in the Himalayas, but archeological inscriptions suggest their mathas existed in south India as well. The early Nath monks received endowments in Karnataka, for example, between the 10th and 13th century, which later became a temple and Shaiva matha hub for them near [[Mangalore]].&lt;ref name=davidwhite94&gt;{{cite book | last =White | first =David Gordon | year =2012 | title =The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India | publisher =University of Chicago Press | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pQuqAAAAQBAJ | pages =94-97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kadri matha, for instance, is one of the legendary monasteries in the Nath tradition which attracted converts from Buddhism and infusion of Buddhist ideas into Shaivism.&lt;ref name=davidwhite94/&gt;

Nath Shaiva monastic organization was one of those Hindu monk groups that militarized and took up arms following the Muslim conquest of India, to resist persecution.&lt;ref&gt;David Lorenzen (2006), Who Invented Hinduism, Yoda Press, {{ISBN|978-8190227261}}, pages 51-63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whitesyogi198&gt;David Gordon White (2011), Sinister Yogis, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226895147}}, pages 198-207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=williampinchwarascetic&gt;William Pinch (2012), Warrior Ascetics and Indian Empires, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1107406377}}, pages 4-9, 28-34, 61-65, 150-151, 189-191, 194-207&lt;/ref&gt; They were scorned and persecuted by Mughal Empire officials, and by social, cultural and religious elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =White | first =David Gordon | year =2012 | title =The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India | publisher =University of Chicago Press | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pQuqAAAAQBAJ | pages =8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shail Mayaram (2003), Against History, Against State, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231127301}}, pages 40-41, 39&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Nath yogi monks have been very popular with the rural population in South Asia since medieval times.&lt;ref name=lorenzenmunozx&gt;David N. Lorenzen and Adrián Muñoz (2012), Yogi Heroes and Poets: Histories and Legends of the Naths, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|978-1438438900}}, pages x-xi&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nath tradition of Shaivism is credited with establishing numerous Shiva Hindu temples and monasteries, particularly in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, north Bihar, and Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =White | first =David Gordon | year =2012 | title =The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India | publisher =University of Chicago Press | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pQuqAAAAQBAJ | page =94-101, 104-105, 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;
