During the Parade of Nations section of the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] opening ceremony, athletes from each country participating in the Olympics paraded in the arena. The flag from each team was borne by a sportsperson from that country chosen either by the National Olympic Committee or by the athletes themselves to represent their country. Unlike the usual practice, the parade of nations was organized according to the English alphabet instead of host nation's language, [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Greece led the parade, followed by [[Andorra at the 1998 Winter Olympics|Andorra]]. Had the parade followed the Japanese characters, Greece would have been followed by Iceland, and Russia would have been the penultimate country before [[Japan at the 1998 Winter Olympics|Japan]]. One [[sumo wrestler]] and one ''yukiko'' (''lit.'' snow children) which bears a country name sign marched before each delegation. Some of famous sumo wrestlers such as [[Takanonami Sadahiro|Takanonami]] and [[Wakanohana Masaru|Wakanohana]] accompanied the teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Akebono to perform 'dohyo-iri' at Olympic opening|url=http://www.shinmai.co.jp/oly-eng/19980128/98012811.htm|website=shinmai.co.jp|accessdate=27 July 2015|date=January 28, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''yukikos'' also took part in several other segments in the ceremony.

'''Albert James Adams''' (May 22, 1845 &amp;ndash; October 1, 1906), known as "The Policy King" and the "Meanest Man in New York," was an American racketeer. He ran the [[numbers game]] in [[New York City]] from around 1890 to around 1905.

==Life==
He was born in [[Massachusetts]] and lived in [[Rhode Island]] before he moved to [[New York City]] in 1871 as a brakeman for the railroad. He married Isabella (1840-?) and had six children: Albert J. Adams, Jr. (1870-?); Lawrence Adams (1874-?); Louis Adams (1875-?); Walter C. Adams (1877-?); Evelyn Adams (1879-?) aka Eveline Adams, who married a Napoleon; and Ida Adams (1874-?) or Claudia P. Adams. In 1880 he was living at 236 West 38th Street in Manhattan and he listed himself as a "segar dealer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:1880_census_Adams.jpg |title=Albert J.

He was named by the [[Lexow Committee]], and was replaced by [[Peter H. Matthews]] when he retired. The anonymous testifier at the Lexow Committee in 1894 said: "[the principal policy backers in this city are] Al Adams. 'Jake' Shipsey, [[Cornelius B. Parker]], 'Billy' Myers, 'Ed' Hogan, [and] [[Charles Frederick Lindauer|Charles Lindauer]]. ...Al has the most ... sheets, and he is the biggest man, and has the most money, and has the biggest pile. ... He is called the king of the policy dealers. ... Al Adams has from Fourteenth street up on the west side mostly." After a 1901 raid on his gambling operation by [[F. Norton Goddard]], the police estimated that he was making more than $1 million a year, and after his conviction in 1903 it was revealed that he had been allowed to stay at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]] until he was sentenced. He was sentenced on April 21, 1903, to "not less than a year and not more than one year and nine months" in [[Sing-Sing]].

On April 5, 1904, his application for [[parole]] was denied by the [[New York State Board of Parole]]. The board members being [[C. V. Collins]], the [[Superintendent of Prisons]]; State Treasurer [[John G. Wickser]] and president of the [[New York State Prison Commission]] [[John P. Jaeckel]]. This meant he was to stay in prison for the maximum time of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=No Parole for "Al" Adams.

'''Alexandra Govere''' is an American [[philanthropist]], [[singer]], [[songwriter]], [[record producer]], [[gymnast]], [[journalist]] and [[reality television]] personality. She first attracted media attention by being the first black female gymnast to represent Zimbabwe in artistic gymnastics at the [[1999 All-Africa Games]], and later by co-founding the Kijana Project, which provides relief for AIDS orphans. She later gained wide media attention as a cast member on the 2011 season of ''[[The Real World: San Diego (2011)|The Real World: San Diego]]''.

==Early life ==

===Music and television===
While attending Stanford University, Govere was discovered by [[Alicia Keys]]' Grammy Award-winning producer, Kerry "Krucial" Brothers, who had heard some songs Govere placed on [[MySpace]] for her mother to hear. Although she initially met with Brothers with the intent to be a songwriter, he made her sing vocals, and recognized her talent.&lt;ref name="Brass" /&gt; With him, she released a mixtape, "[[Love is 4 Suckaz/I'm a Sucka 4 Love]]", some songs from which are available on [[YouTube]]. ''Brass'' magazine describes the mixtape as "a high-wattage soup of synthetic beats and heavy post-production mixing", whose lyrics focus on the themes of love, jealousy, revenge and anti-consumerism.&lt;ref name="Brass" /&gt; Describing Govere's voice, Brandon Goldner of ''Brass'' says, "[Her voice] can range from bright and flute-like to a rougher, almost smoky honesty" Although Govere planned to debut a 2011 album with Krucial,&lt;ref name="Brass" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pumpthebeat.com/?p=1950 "Album: "Love is 4 Suckaz / I'm A Sucka 4 Love" by Andra"].

==Early lives==
===Alvin Neelley===
Alvin Howard Neelley, Jr., was born in 1953 in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], where he was a [[car thief]] during his teenage years. He met his second wife, Judith Ann Adams, when he was 26 years old and she was 15. Alvin divorced his first wife shortly before [[eloping]] with Judith in 1980.&lt;ref name="Boney and Claude"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/women/neelley/5.html |title=Nightrider and Lady Sundown: The Bonnie and Clyde of Georgia |accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judith Ann Neelley===
Judith Ann Adams was born in [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfeesboro]], [[Tennessee]], on June 7, 1964. Her father, an [[alcoholic]], died in a motorcycle accident when she was nine. After meeting Neelley, she began her life of crime, committing [[armed robberies|armed robbery]] across the country (even when heavily pregnant) for which she was later caught. She gave birth to [[twins]] while incarcerated at [[Rome, Georgia]]'s Youth Development Center.&lt;ref name="Boney and Claude"/&gt;

==Youth Development Center crimes==
On September 11, 1982, Ken Dooley, a Youth Development Center employee, was shot at four times. The following day, fellow employee Linda Adair's home was [[firebombing|firebombed]] with a [[Molotov cocktail]]. Phone calls were made to the victims following the attacks by a female who claimed to have been [[sexual abuse|sexually abused]] at the YDC, but neither victim could identify the caller's voice.&lt;ref name="Judy Neelley"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ourgeorgiahistory.com/ogh/Judy_Neelley_-_A_woman_on_death_row |title=Judy Neelley - A woman on death row  |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301015655/http://ourgeorgiahistory.com/ogh/Judy_Neelley_-_A_woman_on_death_row |archivedate=2012-03-01 |accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mysterious Attacks"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/women/neelley/1.html |title=Nightrider and Lady Sundown: The Bonnie and Clyde of Georgia |accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lisa Ann Millican==
[[Lisa Ann Millican]], a 13-year-old girl from [[Cedartown, Georgia]], was abducted by the Neelleys from Rome's [[Riverbend Mall]] on September 25, 1982.&lt;ref name="Judy Neelley"/&gt; She was taken to a motel in [[Scottsboro, Alabama|Scottsboro]], [[Alabama]], where the couple held her captive. During her captivity, Lisa was [[rape]]d by both Neelleys multiple times. On September 28, Judith injected Lisa with [[Drano]], first into one side, and later into both sides of her neck, both arms, and both buttocks in an attempt to poison her to death. [[Liquid Plumber]] was also used on some of the injections. When the painful poisoning failed to kill her, Lisa was shot in the back [[execution-style]] by Judith. Her body thrown over a cliff in the [[Little River Canyon]] in [[Fort Payne, Alabama]].&lt;ref name="Alvin Death"/&gt; Judith later called various police agencies several times to report the location of Lisa's body, where it was found on the canyon floor draped over a fallen tree.&lt;ref name="Serial Killers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skcentral.com/articles.php?article_id=508 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110928130827/http://www.skcentral.com/articles.php?article_id=508 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-09-28 |title=Alvin and Judith Ann Neelley |accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Janice Chatman and John Hancock==
Janice Chatman and John Hancock were a young engaged couple from Rome. On October 4, 1982, they were abducted by Judith.&lt;ref name="Judy Neelley"/&gt; Hancock was shot while Chatman was abducted and brought back to the Neelleys' motel room, where she was tortured and murdered. Hancock, however, survived the shooting and was able to identify the Neelleys as his assailants.&lt;ref name="Serial Killers"/&gt;

==Arrests and trial==
Judith was arrested on October 9, 1982, and Alvin was taken into custody a few days later.&lt;ref name="Judy Neelley"/&gt; Judith was deduced as being the perpetrator in the YDC attacks.&lt;ref name="Serial Killers"/&gt; To avoid the [[death penalty]], Alvin pleaded guilty to [[murder]] and [[aggravated assault]] in Georgia. He was not tried for the Millican murder.&lt;ref name="Serial Killers"/&gt;

Judith's trial began on March 7, 1983, in Fort Payne. Before her trial, however, she gave birth to a third child behind bars.&lt;ref name="Judy Neelley"/&gt; Judith was ultimately convicted of the [[torture murder]] of Lisa Ann Millican. Despite a jury's recommendation to sentence Judith to [[life imprisonment|life in prison]], Judge Randall Cole sentenced the 18-year-old mother of three to death in Alabama's [[electric chair]].&lt;ref name="Judy Pardon"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/women/neelley/10.html |title=Nightrider and Lady Sundown: The Bonnie and Clyde of Georgia |accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her conviction, Judith pleaded guilty to Chatman's murder.

==Aftermath==
Alvin was incarcerated at the [[Bostick State Prison]] from 1983 until his death in October 2005.&lt;ref name="Alvin Death"/&gt;

At 18-years-old, Judith became the youngest woman [[capital punishment in the United States|sentenced to death]] in the U.S. She was placed on Alabama's [[death row]], at the [[Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women]]. Judith [[appeal]]ed for a [[new trial]], but it was denied in March 1987. In 1989, the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] affirmed her death sentence. On January 15, 1999, Judith was days from her execution date when [[Governor of Alabama|Governor]] [[Fob James]] [[clemency|commuted]] her sentence to life in prison with a possibility of [[parole]] in another 15 years (thus, a minimum of 31 years in prison).&lt;ref name="Judy Pardon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blog.al.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/breaking/2009/01/judith_ann_neelley_no_longer_e.html|title=Judith Ann Neelley no longer eligibile for parole |accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was met with controversy, but Gov. James &amp;ndash; long known for his "[[Law and order (politics)|tough]]" position on crime &amp;ndash; cited the jury's recommendation for Judith's sentencing. Judith would have been eligible for parole in January 2014, at age 49, but the Alabama legislature passed a law in 2003 that made her ineligible.&lt;ref name="Judy Pardon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blog.al.com"/&gt;

==In the media==
On February 28, 2008, the Neelleys' case was profiled on the [[Investigation Discovery]] (ID) program ''[[Most Evil]]''. On a scale developed by [[forensic psychiatrist]] Michael Stone, Judith was ranked as a category 22 killer, the "most evil" level deemed for serial torture murderers.&lt;ref name="Most Evil"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://investigation.discovery.com/tv/most-evil/ep-guide/most-evil-ep-guide.html |title=Most Evil : Episode Guide : Investigation Discovery |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222090233/http://investigation.discovery.com/tv/most-evil/ep-guide/most-evil-ep-guide.html |archivedate=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Neelleys were later featured on the ID programs ''[[Wicked Attraction]]''&lt;ref name="Wicked Attraction"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://investigation.discovery.com/tv/wicked-attraction/ |title=Wicked Attraction: Investigation Discovery |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222031013/http://investigation.discovery.com/tv/wicked-attraction/ |archivedate=2011-02-22 |accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Deadly Women]]''.&lt;ref name="Deadly Women"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://investigation.discovery.com/tv/deadly-women/ |title=Twisted Thrills |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815194714/http://investigation.discovery.com/tv/deadly-women/ |archivedate=August 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was second son of [[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] [[Sir Joshua Rowley, 1st Baronet|Sir Joshua Rowley]], and was a member of a notable naval dynasty; his grandfather was [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] [[William Rowley (Royal Navy officer)|Sir William Rowley]], while his younger brother was Admiral Sir Charles Rowley, and his cousins included Admiral [[Sir Josias Rowley, 1st Baronet|Sir Josias Rowley]], Rear-Admiral Samuel Campbell Rowley, Vice-Admiral Sir Joshua Ricketts Rowley, and Admiral of the Fleet [[George Martin (Royal Navy officer)|Sir George Martin]]. His sister Philadelphia Rowley was married to Admiral [[Sir Charles Cotton, 5th Baronet|Sir Charles Cotton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turtlebunbury.com/family/bunburyfamily_related/bunbury_family_related_campbell.html |title=Letitia Campbell &amp; The Rowley Connection |last1=Bunbury |first1=Turtle |year=2005 |work=turtlebunbury.com |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowley attended [[Harrow School]] from 1775,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harrowassociation.com/netcommunity/document.doc?id=190 |title=The Timeline History of Harrow School |last1=Vargas |first1=Dale |year=2010 |work=harrowassociation.com |accessdate=3 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316052830/http://www.harrowassociation.com/NetCommunity/Document.Doc?id=190 |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then entered in the Navy. By 1780 was serving as a [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] aboard his father's [[flagship]], the [[Seventy-four (ship)|74-gun]] {{HMS|Conqueror|1773|2}}. On 31 January 1781 he was [[Post-captain|made post]]&lt;ref&gt;Clowes (1899), p.195&lt;/ref&gt; (before his 17th birthday!) in order to command the 28-gun [[sixth-rate]] frigate {{HMS|Resource|1778|2}}.&lt;ref name="KAFoster"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Foster |first1=Kathleen A. |title=The Sketchbooks and Diary of Joshua Rowley Watson, 1772-1818 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/f/foster-watson.html |accessdate=3 December 2012 |year=1997 |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-8122-3384-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 April 1781 ''Resource'' captured the 20-gun French frigate ''Licorne'' in an action lasting 1½ hours.&lt;ref&gt;Clowes (1899), p.63&lt;/ref&gt; She proved to be the former {{HMS|Unicorn|1776|6}}, which had been captured on 4 September 1780 by a French frigate and two ships of the line off [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]].&lt;ref&gt;Clowes (1899), p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1782 Rowley took command of the [[fifth-rate]] 32-gun frigate {{HMS|Diamond|1774|2}}, where he served until August 1783.&lt;ref name="KAFoster"/&gt; However, with the end of the American Revolutionary War in September 1783, Rowley found himself, like many other naval officers, unemployed on [[half-pay]] for nearly a decade. By the time of the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War in February 1793 Rowley was back at sea in command of the 32-gun frigate {{HMS|Penelope|1783|2}}, serving in the [[Jamaica Squadron]], under the command of Commodore John Ford.&lt;ref&gt;Clowes (1899), p.197&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April 1793 ''Penelope'' captured the French [[aviso]] ''Le Goéland'', commanded by ''[[Ship-of-the-line lieutenant|lieutenant de vaisseau]]'' Leissègues de Pennenyum, en route from [[Cap-Haïtien|Cap-Français]] to [[Jérémie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.servicehistorique.sga.defense.gouv.fr/contenu/functions/dc/attached/FRSHD_PUB_00000226_dc/FRSHD_PUB_00000226_dc_att-FRSHD_PUB_00000226_01.pdf | title=Fonds Marine Campagnes (1790-1804) | date=December 2010 | publisher=[[Service Historique de la Défense]] | location=[[Vincennes]] | page=54 | language=French |trans-title=Naval Campaigns Records (1790-1804) | format=PDF | accessdate=3 December 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306204735/http://www.servicehistorique.sga.defense.gouv.fr/contenu/functions/dc/attached/FRSHD_PUB_00000226_dc/FRSHD_PUB_00000226_dc_att-FRSHD_PUB_00000226_01.pdf | archivedate=6 March 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1793 Ford took advantage of the [[Haitian Revolution]] to occupy several ports in the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] (now [[Haiti]]). On 20 November 1793 ''Penelope'' sailed from [[Môle-Saint-Nicolas]], having received news that the French 36-gun frigate ''L'Inconstante'' was sailing from [[Port-au-Prince]], escorting a large merchant ship. The next day ''Penelope'' met the 32-gun frigate {{HMS|Iphigenia|1780|2}} and the two ships proceeded towards Port-au-Prince. However they learned that ''L'Inconstante'' had sailed to [[Petit-Trou-de-Nippes|Petit Trou]] with two mail ships, but was soon expected to return to port. They intended to [[cutting out operation|cut her out]] of the harbour of Port-au-Prince, but on the night of 25 November met her at sea, and after a brisk exchange of broadsides, ''L'Inconstante'' surrendered. The ''Penelope'' had only one man killed and seven wounded, while the ''L'Inconstante'' had nine killed, including the Captain and the First Lieutenant, and 17 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=13622 |date=8 February 1794 |page=129 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 January 1794 Ford sent ''Penelope'' into Port-au-Prince under a [[flag of truce]] where Rowley demanded the surrender of the island from the French Civil Commissioner [[Léger-Félicité Sonthonax]]. He refused, and the British promptly blockaded the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=13631 |date=11 March 1794 |page=227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the capture of Port-au-Prince on 4 June 1794, Rowley and Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Whitelocke]] were sent back to England with dispatches aboard the [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Fly|1776|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ageofnelson.org/MichaelPhillips/info.php?ref=0930 |title=FLY |last=Phillips |first=Michael |author= |year=2012 |work= Ships of the Old Navy |accessdate=3 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1794 Rowley was appointed captain of the 74-gun {{HMS|Cumberland|1774|2}},&lt;ref name="Winfield"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Winfield |first1=Rif |title=[[British Warships in the Age of Sail]] 1714-1792  |year=2007 |publisher=Seaforth Publishing |location= |isbn=978-1-84415-700-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; taking part in the [[Battle of Hyères Islands]] on 13 July 1795, off the southern coast of France, when a British fleet under Admiral [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]] engaged a French fleet. ''Cumberland'' was in the [[vanguard (military formation)|van]] of the British fleet, accepting the surrender of the French 74 {{Ship|French ship|Alcide|1782|2}}, before Hotham ordered the fleet to disengage.&lt;ref&gt;Clowes, pp. 274-277&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 1797 until October 1798 Rowley commanded the 74-gun {{HMS|Ramillies|1785|2}},&lt;ref name="Winfield"/&gt; capturing the French [[brig]] ''L'Arrogant''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=15138 |date=25 May 1799 |page=509 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowley was promoted to Rear-Admiral on 14 February 1799,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=15107 |date=12 February 1799 |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to Vice-Admiral on 9 November 1805.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=15859 |date=5 November 1805 |page=1374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed Commander-in-Chief at [[Downs Station|The Downs]] in 1807&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Urban|first1=Sylvanus|title=Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle|date=1811|publisher=E.

General '''Basile Gras''' (2 January 1836 – 14 April 1901) created the [[Gras rifle]] for the [[French Army]] in 1874 by converting the Mle 1866 [[Chassepot rifle]] to fire metallic cartridges. Gras, who was a colonel at the time, played a very important role in the formulation and industrial production of the [[Lebel rifle]]. He was an alumnus of [[Ecole Polytechnique]], then a shooting instructor at l'École Normale de Tir at Châlons. Eventually he supervised the three weapon manufacturing facilities at St Etienne, Châtellerault and Tulle. Finally he became Secretary of War for France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =Rifles of the World|page=149|author =John Walter |edition =3|publisher =Krause Publications|year= 2006 |location=Iola|ISBN = 978-0-89689-241-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6618">When studying [[literature]], '''biography and its relationship to literature''' is often a subject of [[literary criticism]], and is treated in several different forms. Two scholarly approaches use [[biography]] or biographical approaches to the past as a tool for interpreting literature: '''literary biography''' and [[biographical criticism]]. Additionally, two genres of fiction rely heavily on the incorporation of biographical elements into their content, [[biographical novel|biographical fiction]] and [[autofiction|autobiographical fiction]].

==Literary biography==
A literary biography is the biographical exploration of the lives of writers and artists. Biographies about artists and writers are sometimes some of the most complicated forms of biography.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; Not only does the author of the biography have to write about the subject of the biography but also must incorporate discussion of the individual's literary works into the biography itself.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt;&lt;ref name = karl&gt;Karl, Frederick R. "Joseph Conrad" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 69–88&lt;/ref&gt; Literary biographers must balance the weight of commentary on the individual works against the biographical content to create a coherent narrative.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; This balance is affected by the degree of biographical elements in an author's literary works. The close relationship between writers and their work relies on ideas that connect human psychology and literature and can be examined through [[psychoanalytic theory]].&lt;ref name = karl/&gt;

Literary biography tends to have a plethora of autobiographical sources. Elizabeth Longford, a biographer of [[Wilfrid Blunt]], noted, "Writers are articulate and tend to leave eloquent source material which the biographer will be eager to use."&lt;ref name= longford&gt;Longford, Elizabeth "Wilfrid Scawen Blunt" of Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 55-68&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors and artists go out of their way to discourage the writing of their biographies, as was the case with Kafka, Eliot, Orwell and Auden. Auden said, "Biographies of writers whether written by others or themselves are always superfluous and usually in bad taste.... His private life is, or should be, of no concern to anybody except himself, his family and his friends."&lt;ref name = meyers&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey "Introduction" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 1–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-received literary biographies include [[Richard Ellmann]]'s ''James Joyce'' and [[George Painter]]'s ''Marcel Proust''.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113&gt;Backschneider 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = meyers/&gt;

==Biographical criticism==
{{main|Biographical criticism}}
Biographical criticism is the deliberate use of biographical information to shed light on the difference created by experience between an author and his audience, and so provide insight into how to understand that particular work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Benson| first = Jackson J| year = 1989| jstor = 25111810| title = Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism| journal = College Literature| issue = 16| volume = 29| pages = 107–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographical fiction==
{{see also|Biographical novel|Biographical film}}
Biographical fiction is a type of [[historical fiction]] that takes a historical individual and recreates elements of his or her life, while telling a fictional narrative, usually in the genres of film or the novel. The relationship between the biographical and the fictional may vary within different pieces of biographical fiction. It frequently includes selective information and self-censoring of the past. The characters are often real people or based on real people, but the need for "truthful" representation is less strict than in [[biography]]. 

The various philosophies behind biographical fiction lead to different types of content. Some asserts itself as a factual narrative about the historical individual, like [[Gore Vidal]]'s ''[[Lincoln (novel)|Lincoln]]''. Other biographical fiction creates two parallel strands of narrative, one in the contemporary world and one focusing on the biographical history, such as [[Malcolm Bradbury]]'s ''[[To the Hermitage]]'' and [[Michael Cunningham]]'s ''[[The Hours (novel)|The Hours]]''. No matter what style of biographical fiction is used, the novelist usually starts the writing process with historical research.&lt;ref name="mullan" /&gt;

Biographical fiction has its roots in late 19th and early 20th-century novels based loosely on the lives of famous people,  but without direct reference to them, such as [[George Meredith]]'s ''[[Diana of the Crossways]]'' (1885) and [[Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' (1919). During the early part of the 20th century this became a distinct genre, with novels that were explicitly about individuals' lives.&lt;ref name = mullan&gt;{{cite news| title = Heavy on the source John Mullan analyses The Master by Colm Tóibín.

==Autobiographical fiction==
{{main|Autofiction}}
{{see also|Autobiographical novel|Autobiographical comics}}
Autobiographical fiction, or autofiction, is fiction that incorporates the author's own experience into the narrative. It allows authors to both rely and reflect on their own experience. However, the reading of the autobiographical fiction need not always be associated with the author. Such books may be treated as distinct fictional works.&lt;ref name = bragg&gt;{{cite news| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article5668638.ece| newspaper = The Sunday Times| date = 8 February 2009| title = Melvyn Bragg on autobiographical fiction| accessdate = 9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brahmarakshasas''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ब्रह्मराक्षस)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7klIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=brahma+rakshas&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6jWUTYrZK4nIrQfCldzzCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=brahma%20rakshas&amp;f=false Brahma-rākshas] A dictionary, Hindustani and English By Duncan Forbes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OOcXAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=brahma+rakshas&amp;dq=brahma+rakshas&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6jWUTYrZK4nIrQfCldzzCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ] The journal of the Anthropological Society of Bombay, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; are fierce [[demon]] [[spirit]]s in [[Hindu mythology]].

==Explanation==
A Brahma Rakshasa is actually the spirit of a [[Brahmin]], a dead scholar of high birth, who has done evil things in his life or has misused his knowledge, who has to suffer as a ''Brahma Rakshasa'' after his or her death. The earth-bound duties of such a scholar would be to disperse  or impart knowledge to good students. If he did not do so, he would turn into a Brahma Rakshasa after death which is a very fierce demonic spirit.&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://www.visvacomplex.com/A_Very_Old_Story.html What is a Brahm-Rakshas?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229232031/http://www.visvacomplex.com/A_Very_Old_Story.html |date=December 29, 2010 }} A VERY OLD STORY ABOUT LATERAL THINKING&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=6jWUTYrZK4nIrQfCldzzCw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=Wr4MAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=brahma+rakshas&amp;q=troublesome#search_anchor Brahman who was proved troublesome after death is known as Brahma Rakshasa.] Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Volume 9, Part 1. Year 1901&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''Brahma'' means [[Brahmin]] and [[Rakshasas|Rakshasa]], a demon. As per ancient Hindu texts they are powerful demon [[spirit]], who have lot of powers and only few in this world can fight and over-come them or give them salvation from this form of life. It would still retain its high level of learning. But it would eat human beings.&lt;ref name=A/&gt; They have the knowledge of their past lives and [[vedas]] and [[puranas]]. In other words, they have qualities of both [[Brahmin]] and Rakshasa.

==In Hindu legends==
It is said that the 7th century [[Sanskrit]] poet  [[Mayurbhatta]], who composed the noted [[Surya Sataka]] (one hundred verses in praise of Lord [[Surya]]) was troubled by Brahmarakshasha. He was doing penance at famous [[Deo Sun Temple]] located at [[Aurangabad district, Bihar|Aurangabad district of Bihar]]. Brahmarakshas was living in the [[Peepal]] tree under which Mayurbhatta was doing penance and creating the verses. It was repeating the verses pronounced by Mayurbhatta, disturbing him. In order to defeat him Mayurbhatta started to pronounce words through nose. Since Brahmarakshasas or other spirits do not have a nose it was defeated and left the tree, which immediately turned dry. After the spirit left Mayurbhatta could peacefully create the hundred verses in praise of [[Surya]], which cured him of [[leprosy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sun Worship in India: A Study of Deo Sun-Shrine  By Anirudha Behari Saran, Gaya Pandey|date=1992|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XimO39s7_gC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=brahma+rakshas+in+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S3wMVJHUPMe9uATuqYLYBg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=brahma%20rakshas%20in%20buddhism&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Stories==

Brahma-Rakshas were a regular feature in old Indian stories like [[Singhasan Battisi|Simhasana Dvatrimsika]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zEh0AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=brahma+rakshas&amp;dq=brahma+rakshas&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cTCUTdmrC8XVrQenrvHvCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA  Brahma-Rakshas in stories of Vikramaditya] Stories of Vikramaditya: Simhasana dwatrimsika:Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Panchatantra]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videokeralam.com/kids-story-time/panchatantra-tales-greedy-brahma-rakshas-and-the-thief-kids-animation-stories-video_7a4f2ccd9.html Panchatantra Tales - Greedy Brahma Rakshas And The Thief - Kids Animation Stories]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ivkAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA321&amp;dq=brahma+rakshas&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cTCUTdmrC8XVrQenrvHvCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=brahma%20rakshas&amp;f=false Brahma Rakshas in Indian stories] Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland, Volume 8,By Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt; and other old wives tales.&lt;ref name=A/&gt; As per these stories, Brahma-Rakshas, were powerful enough also to grant any boon, money, gold, if they became pleased with any person. In most of the stories, they are depicted as huge, mean and fierce looking having two horns on head like a Rakshas and a [[Sikha|Choti]] like a [[Brahmin]] and usually found hanging upside down on a tree. Also a Brahma Rakshas would sometimes eat human beings in stories.

==Temples==

In many Hindu temples, especially in Central India like [[Maharashtra]]&lt;ref name=pg3/&gt; and South India like Kerala and Karnataka you can find idols of Brahm Rakshas in outer walls and are generally offered [[Puja (Hinduism)|pooja]], respects and an oil lamp is lit on regular basis in front of their idols.&lt;ref name=pg3/&gt; There are many temples, where they are also worshiped as demi-gods, like in Malliyor Temple of [[Kottayam]] District of [[Kerala]], it is customary to take permission from Brahma Rakshas before commencing the construction activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malliyoortemple.com/docs/Main.asp?ID=Upadevathas The deity of Brahma Rakshas is located on the southern side of the temple facing the east. It is customary to take permission from Brahma Rakshas before commencing the construction activities.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311151416/http://www.malliyoortemple.com/docs/Main.asp?ID=Upadevathas |date=March 11, 2011 }} The Malliyoor Sree MahaGanapathy Temple in Kottayam district, Kerala&lt;/ref&gt; Further, at Thirunakkara Shiva Temple also in Kottayam in Kerala, there is a separate temple for Brahm Rakshasa. There is an interesting story about why the Brahma Rakshas temple was built here. One person called Moose was a great friend of the king. The king was not known for his beauty but his friend Moose, was very handsome. The queen fell in love with this friend knowing which the king ordered his servants to kill Moose. Instead of killing him the King’s servants killed the junior priest of the temple (keezh Santhi). The wife of the priest became a Brahma Rakshas and started troubling every body. So the king built a temple for her. For a long time afterward women did not prefer to enter this temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Thirunakkara_Shiva_Temple Besides these there is a separate temple for Vadakkunathan, Subrahmanya, Durga and Brahma Rakshas. There is an interesting story about the Brahma Rakshas.] Thirunakkara Shiva Temple&lt;/ref&gt; Further, it is said that at [[Madikeri]] the Omkareshwar [[Shiva]] temple was built by king to ward of evil caused by Brahm-Rakshasa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homestaykodagu.com/tourist_place.html Madikeri]&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Shringeri]], the Malayala Brahma Temple is of a Brahma-Raskshas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mustseeindia.com/Sringeri-Malayala-Brahma-Temple/attraction/13917 Legendary stories related to this temple tells that one of the Malayala Brahmana Scholar got a curse and became a Brahma Rakshas for not sharing his knowledge with others. Sage Vidyaranya asked him to serve as a Kshetra Palaka to come out from the curse he got.]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there is separate temple for Brahma Raksha within complex of famous Kandiyoor [[Shiva]] Temple near [[Mavelikkara]].In [[Njarakkal]] in [[Kerala]] there is an 800-year-old [[Durga|Bhagavathi]] temple where the other temples  include [[Shiva]], [[Nāga|Nagaraja]], and ''Sree Brahmarakshas''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kandiyoortemple.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/09-09/features1500.htm Brahma Rakshas and Parabrahma]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Palakkad district]] of Kerala at mundakottukursi near [[Shornur]], a ''Mana'' ( meaning the family house of the [[Namboodri]] Kerala Brahmins) called "Akathekunnathu Mana" where people worship Brahmaraksha and do some ''vazhipadu'' or rites to get rid of haunting and troubles created by the spirit of Brahmaraksha.In [[Udupi district|Udupi]] of Karnataka, there are many temples to rid possession or troubles from a Brahmarakshasa. One such temple is [[Maranakatte]].

==In Art==

There are different plays like Kaisika Natakam in South India where artist play role of Brham-Rakshas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ashramyoga.org/tag/kaisika-ekadasi/ Gopi, an amateur artiste working as a Junior Assistant at Sastra University, Thanjavur, played the powerful role of the Brahma Rakshasa with ease. While the entire portrayal was exemplary, it was the last scene – where he pleads with Nampaduvan to relieve him from the curse of his previous birth and to help attain moksham – that brought tears to the eyes of the devotees and won him an ovation.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811220844/http://ashramyoga.org/tag/kaisika-ekadasi/ |date=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Jainism==

Further, there are mention of Brahma-Rakshas also in [[Jainism]] in their scripts and stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/09-09/features1500.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ramanuja/magazine/RD_0203_online_vers.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In South East Asia==
In countries like [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]] and also [[Java]] whose culture has large influence of Hindu heritage and [[Sanskrit]] language, we can find little shrines elevated on poles. These are erected in neighborhood of every house in veneration of nature spirit. These spirits were identified in early times with Hindu deities or Sanskrit names like Brahmarakshsa, Sri Shikeshwara ([[Shiva]]), Sri Champeshwara ([[Krishna]]) and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism and Buddhism: An Historical Sketch (Complete)  By Sir Charles Eliot|date=1962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eC4sbnNUwkcC&amp;pg=PT803&amp;dq=brahma+rakshas+in+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S3wMVJHUPMe9uATuqYLYBg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=%20Brahmarakshas&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In 2014, [[Vikram Bhatt]], has made India's first 3D creature horror film, titled '[[Creature 3D]]', in which his creature or demon is a Brahmarakshas - a mutant from Indian mythology.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt; However, his demon who is a Brahma Rakshas, will not be a copy of its ancient Idol, in order to avoid hurting any religious sentiments.&lt;ref name=pg3&gt;{{cite news|title=Vikram Bhatts Brahma Rakshas will not be a replica of an ancient Idol|url=http://www.webmail.motiwalas.com/gossips/37/4636-vikram-bhatts-brahma-rakshas-will-not-be-a-replica-of-an-ancient-idol|accessdate=7 September 2014|issue=Page 3 Bollywood|date=12 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907191831/http://www.webmail.motiwalas.com/gossips/37/4636-vikram-bhatts-brahma-rakshas-will-not-be-a-replica-of-an-ancient-idol|archivedate=7 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, Vikram Bhatt came up with his own imaginative take on the creature by using special effects in this film. In the film the Brahmarakshasha is depicted as a 10-feet tall animal like creature, which has a swishing tail, carnivorous teeth and nails. It is in the same league as the [[Yeti]].&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite news|title=Bipasha Basu starrer 'Creature' is a Brahmarakshas!|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Bipasha-Basu-starrer-Creature-is-a-Brahmarakshas/articleshow/31317059.cms|accessdate=7 September 2014|issue=Times of India|publisher=Times of India|date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, [[Zee TV]] announced the weekly horror based television series titled [[Brahmarakshas (TV series)|Brahmarakshasha—the story of a resurrected Satan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1428">'''Caelia''' (or Celia) is a [[Fairy Queen]] in [[Richard Johnson (16th century)|Richard Johnson]]'s [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] ''[[Tom a Lincoln]]''. Caelia is the ruler of an island called "Fairy Land," populated by women who have slain their warmongering men.  She begs Tom and his companions to stay on the island so that it might be re-peopled. She eventually bears Tom's son, the [[Faerie Knight]], but later commits [[suicide]] by drowning herself when she thinks that Tom has abandoned her.

She further appears in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' as the ruler of the House of Holiness where with the help of her three daughters she helps the [[Redcrosse Knight]] (the epic's protagonist) regain his strength and holiness to complete his quest.  Caelia is described in [[s:The Faerie Queene/Book I/Canto X|Canto X of Book I]].  Her name refers to the Heavenly Spirit.  She resides in the House of Holiness, which serves as the direct opposite of the House of Pride that appears earlier in the book. She is the mother of Faith, Hope, and Charity, otherwise known as Fidelia, Speranza, and Charissa.

==Fictional character biography==
===X-Factor and The Right===
Cameron Hodge was the college roommate of [[Archangel (comics)|Warren Worthington III]] (also known as the superhuman Angel). Hodge then took a public relations job with a New York advertising firm. After Angel's former [[Defenders (comics)|superhero team]] disbanded, Hodge and Worthington hatched a plan to reunite the original roster of the [[X-Men]]. Under Hodge's plan, the five mutants would pose as professional mutant hunters under the name X-Factor. They would use this cover to contact and teach young mutants.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the plan backfired, as X-Factor's advertising campaign increased anti-mutant hysteria. In addition, the team suffered a series of major setbacks. After suffering severe injuries during the [[Mutant Massacre]], Angel's wings were amputated, and then seemingly dies in a private jetplane explosion. Tensions arose between X-Factor members [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and Marvel Girl when Cyclops saw manifestations of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] around [[Jean Grey]]. X-Factor later discovered that Hodge had orchestrated Angel's amputation and jetplane accident and had created holograms simulating the Phoenix Force.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #14-16&lt;/ref&gt; Hodge had secretly been Commander of an [[Right (comics)|anti-mutant terrorist group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had fully intended to exacerbate anti-mutant tensions through his advertising campaign.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #17&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Hodge and The Right made a pact with the extradimensional demonic entity [[N'astirh]]. In exchange for collecting mutant babies, the Right needed for a spell to open up a portal from Limbo to Earth, N'astirh promised Hodge immortality and the continued existence of The Right and its work creating conflict between humans and mutants. Earlier Hodge kidnapped and tortured [[Candace Southern|Candy Southern]] (Warren's former girlfriend). However, his former friend survived the private plane explosion and was transformed into Archangel by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], and invades the Right's headquarters, decapitating Hodge after Hodge kills Candy.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #34 (November 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hodge's efforts would provide unexpected blows against his enemies; his [[Ani-Mator|employee]] ends up shooting dead the New Mutant team member [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]],&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' #60&lt;/ref&gt; and another employee would end up becoming a [[Nanny (comics)|powerful cyberneticist]] who, with the assistance of [[Orphan-Maker]], would plague the X-Men multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #30-35&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Tinction Agenda===
Cameron Hodge was revealed to be alive, his severed head having been attached to a grotesque non-humanoid cyborg, a fate Hodge said he survived as a result of the pact he made with N'astirh.  Hodge took the leading role of the anti-mutant efforts of the [[Genosha]]n government during the "[[The X-Tinction Agenda|X-Tinction Agenda]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline. In the initial attack on the X-Men, members of the [[New Mutants]], plus [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] are kidnapped. [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] dies when Hodge tries and fails to steal the mutant's shape-changing powers, [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] is brainwashed into a slave, and [[Rictor]] and [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]] escape into the streets. During the incident, it is revealed that [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] had come to be working for Hodge as a Magistrate. Havok regains his own memory and tries to bring down Hodge from within.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #62&lt;/ref&gt;

Hodge is confronted by a combined force of X-Men, X-Factor, and New Mutants. Wolfsbane, her mind partly restored, plays a major factor in defeating Hodge, as the mutant transforms Into a giant wolf-form that severely wounds him. The fight soon comes down to Havok, Cyclops and Hodge. The villain ultimately ends up as a head, still immortal, buried as Rictor knocks a building down on top of him.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #62 (January 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phalanx===
Cameron Hodge later returns as a member of the cybernetic extraterrestrial [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] race, ironically a form he would have taken if his efforts with Warlock had been successful. Yet again he was apparently slain by Archangel.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #306 (November 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Hodge was defeated by [[Steven Lang (comics)|Steven Lang]] when the Phalanx's human interface caused the Phalanx citadel to fall from the top of Mount Everest.&lt;ref&gt;''Cable'' #16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purifiers===
Cameron Hodge's remains are found in the Himalayas by a group of [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]]. He is later revived when [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] infects him with the transmode virus gained from one of Magus' offspring.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' (3rd series) #3&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron and his whole army of "Smileys" are killed by Warlock of the New Mutants at the behest of Douglas Ramsey when his lifeforce and the lifeforces of the Smileys are forcibly absorbed by Warlock via their shared connection of the technorganic Transmode virus.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Legacy'' #237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, Cameron Hodge was the commander of The Right, thus he had access to all the weaponry and resources of the organization, including a ruby quartz battle suit capable of deflecting [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]'s Optic Blasts. The demonic being [[N'astirh]] granted Hodge immortality, that is, he is able to survive a decapitation and still function.

In his cyborg form, he had the ability to phase (move through solid matter) and used various special weapons. His spider/scorpionlike robot body was equipped with tentacles, a powerful stinger, plasma and laser weapons, and a molecular adhesive gun, and could also fire bolas, knives and spears of varying sizes. He also possessed a high degree of invulnerability, enough to protect him from the combined attacks of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], Cyclops and [[Jean Grey]]. This effect was supposedly augmented by external generators linked to his mainframe computer. When these had been destroyed, Cyclops and [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] could destroy his mechanical body, but not kill him. In addition, in his mechanical body's first appearance, it had a cardboard cutout of a man's suit and body that hung from Hodge's neck, affecting a (to his mind) more normal appearance when his attempt to absorb [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]]'s techno-organic abilities had failed.

As part of the [[Phalanx (comics)#Phalanx on Earth|Phalanx]], he had all their typical abilities, but seemingly lost his magical protection.

==Other versions==

===House of M===
Cameron Hodge was a member of the Human Liberation Front, a human supremacist terrorist group that had targeted [[Sunfire (comics)|Emperor Sunfire's]] Project Genesis, a program intended to forcefully turn humans into mutants. He was arrested following the attack on the New Mutant Leadership Program at the United Nations, though the true target was Sean Garrison, secretly an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and one of the masterminds behind Project Genesis.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #16&lt;/ref&gt; S.H.I.E.L.D. agents [[Elixir (comics)|Josh Foley]] and [[Wither (comics)|Kevin Ford]] were about to torture him when they were interrupted by [[Surge (comics)|Agent Noriko Ashida]], daughter of Hodge's comrade Seiji Ashida, who learned from Hodge about her father's location. Fearing the torture at the hands of Foley and Ford, Hodge convinced Noriko to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #17&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Men Forever===
A version of Cameron Hodge exists in the ''[[X-Men Forever]]'' reality.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Forever'' Vol. 2 #13&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
* Cameron Hodge appeared in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Stephen Ouimette]]. He first appeared in season one. In the episode "Enter Magneto", he was a lawyer for [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. In the episode "Slave Island", Hodge was an ambassador (alongside [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] and [[Bolivar Trask]]) for the [[Genosha|Genoshan government]], a mutant-oppressing prison which held many mutants captive (including [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]). As the Genoshan government gets overthrown by the [[X-Men]], Cameron gets injured by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s assault. Season five revealed that Cameron was now minus an arm and a leg as a result. Wanting revenge on mutants, he instigated the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] infection. During the two-part episode "Phalanx Covenant", Hodge willingly merged with the Phalanx techno-organic alien race's leader. Granting him a fraction of their power, Cameron helped the assimilation of Earth and the inhabitants. He helped the Phalanx moved throughout Earth and would try to assimilate mutants, including the X-Men. Hodge was defeated when Beast lead a group of mutants (consisting of [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], [[Mister Sinister]], [[Amelia Voght]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]) drove the alien infestation from Earth, restoring Cameron's maimed body. Hodge was later mentioned in the episode "Hidden Agendas" as part of a rogue military group.

'''Alfred Dillwyn "Dilly" Knox''', [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]] (23 July 1884 &amp;ndash; 27 February 1943) was a British [[classics]] scholar and [[papyrologist]] at [[King's College, Cambridge]] and a [[cryptanalysis|codebreaker]]. As a member of the [[World War I]] [[Room 40]] codebreaking unit, he helped decrypt the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] which brought the USA into [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Gannon 2011"&gt;{{Harvnb |Gannon|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Government Code and Cypher School|GC&amp;CS]] at the war's end.&lt;ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"&gt;{{Harvnb|Batey|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As Chief Cryptographer,&lt;ref name ="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/&gt; Knox played an important role in the Polish-French-British meetings on the eve of [[World War II]] which disclosed [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Polish disclosures|Polish cryptanalysis]] of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] Enigma to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].&lt;ref name="copeland.colossus.smith"/&gt; 

At [[Bletchley Park]] he worked on the cryptanalysis of [[Enigma machine|Enigma ciphers]] until his death in 1943. He built the team and discovered the method that broke the Italian Naval [[Enigma machine|Enigma]], producing the intelligence credited with [[Allies (World War II)|Allied]] victory at the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]]. In 1941, Knox broke the [[Abwehr]] [[Enigma machine|Enigma]].&lt;ref name='batey.enigmas.xi'&gt;{{Harvnb |Batey|2009|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, '''Intelligence Service Knox''' had disseminated 140,800 [[Abwehr]] decrypts,&lt;ref name='batey.enigmas.xi'/&gt; including intelligence important for [[D-Day]].&lt;ref name='telegraph.obituary' /&gt;

==Personal life and family==
Dillwyn Knox, the fourth of six children,&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{Harvnb |Batey |2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the son of [[Edmund Arbuthnott Knox]],&lt;!-- notable:  he has an ODNB entry--&gt; tutor at [[Merton College]] and later [[Bishop of Manchester]]; he was the brother of [[E. V. Knox]], [[Wilfred Knox]] and [[Ronald Knox]],&lt;!-- also all with ODNB entries--&gt;&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; and uncle of the novelist [[Penelope Fitzgerald]].&lt;ref name='fitzgerald.knox'&gt;{{Harvnb |Fitzgerald|2002|}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a descendant of [[John Arbuthnott, 8th Viscount of Arbuthnott]].&lt;ref&gt;Dod's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage of Great Britain and Ireland, Sampson Low, Marston &amp; Co., 1904, p. 983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Spectator, vol. 20, 1847, p. 1171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Gentleman's Magazine, vol. 177, 1845, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kittybrewster.com/members/e_2.htm|title=Table E part 2|first=Sir William Arbuthnot|last=Bt|website=www.kittybrewster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dillwyn—known as "Dilly"—Knox was educated at [[Summer Fields School]], Oxford, and then [[Eton College]].&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; He studied classics at [[King's College, Cambridge]] from 1903,&lt;ref name=Classics&gt;[http://www.classicsireland.com/2002/richmond.html Richmond, John ''Classics and Intelligence'' - 'Classics Ireland' Volume 9 (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1909 was elected a Fellow&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; following the death of [[Walter George Headlam]], from whom he inherited extensive research into the works of [[Herodas]]. While an [[undergraduate]] he was friends with [[Lytton Strachey]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]]. He and Keynes were lovers at Eton.&lt;ref name=Supermac&gt;{{Cite book |title= Supermac: The Life of Harold Macmillan |last= Thorpe|first= D.R.|page= 27 |publisher=[[Chatto &amp; Windus]] |year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox privately coached [[Harold Macmillan]], the future [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] at King's for a few weeks in 1910, but Macmillan found him "austere and uncongenial".&lt;ref name=Classics/&gt;

He married Olive Rodman in 1920, forgetting to invite two of his three brothers to his wedding.&lt;ref name='batey.enigmas.xii'&gt;{{Harvnb|Batey|2009|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two sons, Oliver and Christopher.  

He was an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;"Dillwyn [Knox, son of an Evangelical bishop] was from his student years an unwavering atheist." Alan Hollinghurst, "The Victory of Penelope Fitzgerald" (a review of Hermione Lee, Penelope Fitzgerald [a niece of Alfred Dillwyn Knox]: A Life, Knopf, 488 pp.), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXI, no. 19 (December 4, 2014), p. 8. (The article comprises pp. 8, 10, 12.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic scholarship==
Between the two World Wars Knox worked on the great commentary on [[Herodas]] that had been started by [[Walter George Headlam|Headlam]], damaging his eyesight while studying the [[British Museum]]'s collection of [[papyrus]] fragments, but finally managing to decipher the text of the Herodas papyri. The Knox-Headlam edition of Herodas finally appeared in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Herodas | author-link = Herodas | editor-last = Hedlam | editor-first = Walter | editor-link = Walter George Headlam | editor2-last = Knox | editor2-first = A. D. | editor2-link = Dilly Knox | title = The Mimes and Fragments | publisher = Hardpress  | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1290531078 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Codebreaking==
=== World War I ===
{{Rquote|right| 
The sailor in Room 53&lt;br/&gt; 
has never, it's true, been to sea &lt;br/&gt;but though not in a boat &lt;br/&gt;he has served afloat — &lt;br/&gt;in a bath in the Admiralty.|Alice in ID25 by [[Francis Birch (cryptographer)|Frank Birch]]&lt;ref name="codebreaker.pre-war"&gt;{{Harvnb|Andrew|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Soon after [[World War I]] broke out in 1914,&lt;ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/&gt; Knox was recruited to the [[Royal Navy|Royal Navy's]] [[Cryptography|cryptological]] effort in [[Room 40]] of the Admiralty Old Building,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goebel}}&lt;/ref&gt; where some of his best work is said to have been done in the bath (in Room 53).&lt;ref name="codebreaker.pre-war"/&gt; In 1917, Knox followed Room 40 with its expansion into [[ID25]].&lt;ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/&gt;

Among other tasks, he was involved in breaking:
* the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] which brought the USA into the war.&lt;ref name="Gannon 2011"/&gt;
* much of the German admiral's flag code by exploiting an operator's love of romantic poetry.&lt;ref name ="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/&gt;

===Between WW1 and WW2===
====Government Code and Cypher School====
{{Rquote|right|Oh, if a time should ever come when we're demobilized
How we shall miss the interests which once life comprised!|Dilly the Dodo&lt;ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/&gt;|Alice in ID25 by [[Francis Birch (cryptographer)|Frank Birch]]}}
During [[World War I]] he had been elected Librarian at King's College, but never took up the appointment. After the war Knox intended to resume his research at King’s, but was persuaded by his wife to remain at his secret work; indeed, so secret was this work that his own children had no idea, until many years after his death, what he did for a living, and his contribution to the war effort.&lt;ref name=Classics/&gt;

====Commercial Enigma====
The [[Enigma machine]] became available commercially in the 1920s. In [[Vienna]] in 1925,&lt;ref name="codebreaker.hugh_foss"&gt;{{Harvnb|Foss|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox bought the Enigma 'C' machine evaluated by [[Hugh Foss]] in 1927 on behalf of GC&amp;CS. Foss found "a high degree of security" but wrote a secret paper describing how to attack the machine if ''cribs'' — short sections of plain text — could be guessed.&lt;ref name="copeland.colossus.smith"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When — a decade later — Knox picked up this work, he developed a more effective algebraic system (''rodding'') based on the principles described by Foss.&lt;ref name="codebreaker.hugh_foss"/&gt;

====Spanish Enigma====
Germany Navy adopted Enigma in 1926, adding a plug-board ('stecker') to improve security. [[Nazi Germany]] supplied non-steckered machines to [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]].  On 24 April 1937, Knox broke Franco's Enigma&lt;ref name="copeland.colossus.smith"/&gt; but knowledge of this breakthrough was not shared with the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keeley|2008}} States "Professor Denis Smyth, of the University of Toronto, an expert on Second World War intelligence operations, said that the British codebreaker Alfred Dilwyn Knox cracked the code of Franco's machine in 1937, but 'this information was not passed on to the Republicans'."&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, Knox began to attack signals between Spain and Germany encrypted using steckered Enigma machines.&lt;ref name="copeland.colossus.smith"/&gt;

====On the eve of World War II====
=====Polish-French-British meetings=====
GC&amp;CS began to discuss Enigma with [[France]]'s [[Deuxième Bureau]] in 1938, obtaining from the Bureau details of [[Wehrmacht Enigma]] supplied by [[Asché]] and signal intercepts, some of which must have been made in [[Eastern Europe]]. This led the French to disclose their links with [[Biuro Szyfrów|Polish cryptographers]].&lt;ref name="copeland.colossus.smith"/&gt;  Knox, [[Hugh Foss]] and [[Alastair Denniston]] represented [[Government Code and Cypher School|GS&amp;CS]] at the first Polish-French-British meeting at Paris in January 1939.&lt;ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/&gt; The Poles were under order to disclose nothing of importance at this time, leaving the British codebreakers disappointed. However Knox's description of his system of rodding impressed the Polish codebreakers, and they requested his presence at a second meeting.&lt;ref name="copeland.colossus.smith"/&gt;
{{Quotation| Knox grasped everything very quickly, almost quick as lightning. It was evident that the British had been really working on Enigma ... So they didn't require explanations. They were specialists of a different kind, of a different class.|[[Marian Rejewski]]&lt;ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/&gt;}}

Knox attended the second [[Biuro Szyfrów#Gift to allies|Polish-French-British conference]], held on 25–26 July 1939 at the Polish [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] facility (at [[Pyry (neighborhood)|Pyry]], south of [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]). Here, the Poles began to disclose to their French and British allies their achievements in solving [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] [[decryption]].&lt;ref name="Budiansky"&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=95,96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Marian Rejewski]], the Polish [[cryptographer]] and [[mathematician]] who solved the plugboard-equipped [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] used by [[Nazi Germany]], approached the problem through [[Group theory|permutation theory]] (whereas Knox applied [[linguistics]]) a good personal relationship was quickly established at the conference. The good impression made by Rejewski on Knox played an important role in increasing recruitment of mathematicians to [[Bletchley Park]].&lt;ref name ="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/&gt; Knox was chagrined — but grateful — to learn how simple was the solution of the Enigma's entry ring (standard [[alphabetical order]]).&lt;ref name="Budiansky"/&gt; {{Quotation| It was such an obvious thing to do, really a silly thing to do, that nobody, not Dilly Knox or Tony Kendrick or Alan Turing, ever thought it worthwhile trying it.|[[Peter Twinn]]&lt;ref name="copeland.colossus.smith"/&gt;}}

After the meeting, he sent the Polish cryptologists a very gracious note in Polish, on official British government stationery, thanking them for their assistance and sending "sincere thanks for your cooperation and patience".&lt;ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/&gt; Enclosed were a beautiful scarf featuring a picture of a [[Derby (horse race)|Derby]] winner and a set of paper 'batons'.&lt;ref name="Budiansky"/&gt;{{Quotation|I don't know how Knox's method was supposed to work, most likely he had hoped to vanquish Enigma with the batons. Unfortunately we beat him to it.|[[Marian Rejewski]]&lt;ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/&gt;}}

These 'batons' were known as rods to the British and had been used to solve the Spanish Enigma. Knox's rodding method was later used to break the Italian Naval Enigma.&lt;ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/&gt;

=====Turing's bombe=====
[[Alan Turing]] worked on Enigma during the months leading to the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, and occasionally visited GC&amp;CS's London HQ to discuss this problem with Knox. 
In the [[1939 Registration]], Turing was recorded in [[Naphill]], staying with Knox and his wife.
By November 1939, Turing had completed the design of the [[bombe]] — a radical improvement of the Polish [[Bomba (cryptography)|bomba]].&lt;ref name=codebreaker.copeland&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2011|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
====Knox's rodding method====
To break non-steckered [[Enigma machine]]s (those without a plugboard), Knox (building on earlier research by [[Hugh Foss]]&lt;ref name="copeland.colossus.smith"/&gt;) developed a system known as 'rodding', a linguistic as opposed to mathematical way of breaking codes. This technique worked on the Enigma used by the [[Regia Marina|Italian Navy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the German [[Abwehr]]. Knox worked in 'the Cottage', next door to the [[Bletchley Park]] mansion, as head of a research section, which contributed significantly to [[cryptanalysis of the Enigma]].&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

Knox's team at ''The Cottage'' used rodding to decrypt intercepted Italian naval signals describing the sailing of an Italian battle fleet, leading to the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] in March 1941. [[John Henry Godfrey|Admiral John Godfrey]], [[Naval Intelligence Division (UK)|Director of Naval Intelligence]] credited the [[Allied (World War II)|Allied]] victory at Matapan to this intelligence; [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham]], who had commanded the victorious fleet at Matapan, went to Bletchley to personally congratulate 'Dilly and his girls'.&lt;ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/&gt;

====Intelligence Services Knox====
In October 1941, Knox solved the [[Enigma machine|Abwehr Enigma]].&lt;ref name='batey.enigmas.xi'/&gt; Intelligence Services Knox (ISK) was established to decrypt [[Abwehr]] communications.&lt;ref name='batey.enigmas.xi'/&gt;In early 1942, with Knox seriously ill, [[Peter Twinn]] took charge of running ISK&lt;ref name='telegraph.obituary'&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1476763/Peter-Twinn.html|title=Peter Twinn|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=17 November 2004|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed head after Knox's death.&lt;ref name='batey.enigmas.xi'/&gt; By the end of the war, ISK had decrypted and disseminated 140,800 messages.&lt;ref name='batey.enigmas.xi'/&gt;

Intelligence gained from these Abwehr decrypts played an important part in ensuring the success of [[Double-Cross System|Double-Cross operations]] by MI5 and MI6, and in [[Operation Fortitude]], the Allied campaign to deceive the Germans about [[D-Day]].&lt;ref name='telegraph.obituary' /&gt;

====Death====
Knox's work was cut short when he fell ill with [[lymphoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sebag-Montefiore|2000|p=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he became unable to travel to Bletchley Park, he continued his cryptographic work from his home in [[Hughenden Valley|Hughenden, Buckinghamshire]], where he received the [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]].&lt;ref name="fitz249250"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitzgerald|2002|pp=249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 27 February 1943.&lt;ref name="fitz249250"/&gt; A biography of Knox, written by [[Mavis Batey]], one of 'Dilly's girls', the female codebreakers who worked with him, was published in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Batey|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classified poetry==

Knox celebrated the victory at [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] with poetry, which remained classified until 1978.&lt;ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/&gt;

==Portrayals in fiction==
Knox is shown recruiting [[Alan Turing]] to [[Bletchley Park]] in [[Hugh Whitemore]]'s play, ''[[Breaking the Code]]'' (1986). In the 1996 television film, he is portrayed by [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]].

The [[United States Navy]] job [[Naval rating|rating]] of '''Electronics Technician''' (abbreviated as '''ET''') is a designation given by the Bureau of Naval Personnel ([[BUPERS]]) to enlisted members who satisfactorily complete initial Electronics Technician "A" school training.

==History of the Electronics Technician rating==

{{Infobox Military rating
|name= Electronics technician
|image=[[File:Rating Badge ET.jpg|125px]]
|caption= Rating insignia
|issued_by= [[United States Navy]]
|type= Enlisted rating
|abbreviation= ET
|specialty= Technical
|Disestablished=29 September 2016}}

===WWII era===
The Electronics Technician (abbreviated as ET) rating was originally established as Radio Technician (abbreviated as RT) in April 1942 during the height of [[World War II]]. The story of their training may be found at "Solving the Naval Radar Crisis" by Raymond C Watson, Jr. Trafford Publishing 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-4251-6884-1}}. 
The rating insignia adopted was that of the established [[Radioman]] (abbreviated as RM) rating, and remained until October 1945, when the rating name was changed to Electronic Technician's Mate (abbreviated as ETM). In 1948, the Navy changed the name of the rating to Electronics Technician, and a new rating insignia was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/c/enlisted-ratings-in-u-s-navy-1775-1969.html |title=Compilation of Enlisted Ratings and Apprenticeships, U.S. Navy, 1775 to 1969 |publisher=History.navy.mil |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam era to present===
In 1971 the [[Radarman]] (abbreviated as RD) rating was disestablished. Former Radarmen, depending on their training, were placed in to the either the established Electronic Technician (ET) rating or either of the newly established [[Operations specialist (United States Navy)|Operations Specialist]] (abbreviated as OS) or Electronic Warfare Technician (abbreviated as EW) ratings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.navycs.com/navy-jobs/operations-specialist.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 1998 the [[Data systems technician|Data Systems Technicians]] (abbreviated as DS) rating was disestablished. Former Data Systems Technicians were, depending on their training, placed in to either the Electronics Technician or [[Fire controlman|Fire Controlman]] (abbreviated as FC) rating.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navydads.com/forum/topics/discontinued-and-changed&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of the service ratings ET, ETR, ETV, and ETN===

On November 3, 2015 a mostly administrative change was made to the general ET rating. Electronics Technicians who volunteered for submarine duty where redesignated as either Electronics Technician, Submarine, Communications (abbreviated as ETR) or Electronics Technician, Submarine, Navigation (abbreviated as ETV). Nuclear Power trained Electronics Technicians were redesignated as Electronics Technicians, Nuclear Power (abbreviated as ETN). Electronics Technicians serving in the service rating Electronics Technician (ET) remained designed as Electronics Technician (ET). Electronics Technician (ET) is sometimes abbreviated as ETSW when it is necessary to distinguish ET from ETR, ETV, and ETN. All three new ratings as well as the original Electronics Technician rating use the same Electronics Technician rating insignia.&lt;ref name="NAVADMIN 261/15" /&gt;

The reason for the change is because even those these four service ratings (ET, ETR, ETV, and ETN) fall under the same general rating (ET), share a common history, have similar names and share the same rating insignia the enlistment requirements, initial 'A' school training, specialized 'C' school training, job assignments (billets), specific qualification, and community managers are unique to each of the four service rating. This prevents someone trained in any of the four service rating from easily transferring to another of the four service rating without first going through significant retraining and qualification that would be required by anyone transferring from any of the other general rating in the Navy.&lt;ref name="NAVADMIN 261/15" /&gt;

===Elimination of all Naval Ratings===
On September 29, 2016 the Navy moved away from traditional ratings to an alphanumeric system of Navy Occupational Specialty (NOS) codes. The ET-related NOS codes were: for ET, B420; for ETR, C126; for ETV, C121; for ETN, D110, D111, or D112. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2016/NAV16218.txt |title=NAVADMIN 16218 |publisher=navy.mil |date= |accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2016 however, after months of widespread complaints, Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson released a message announcing a restoration of all U.S. Navy Ratings.

==== Electronics Technician Navy Enlisted Classifications ====
The [[Navy Enlisted Classification]] (NEC) system supports the enlisted rating structure in identifying personnel and billets in manpower authorizations. NEC codes identify a non-rating wide skill, knowledge, aptitude, or qualification that must be documented to identify both people and billets for management purposes.  The most current information regarding NECs can be found in the Navy [http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/nec/NECOSVolII/Pages/default.aspx NEOCS Manual.]

After 'A' school and between duty assignments ETs will attend advanced 'C' school training. These 'C' school give the ET advanced training in the specific systems that will be required to maintain and repair at their next duty assignment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cool.navy.mil/usn/enlisted/rating_info_cards/et.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 62 ET-related NECs.&lt;ref name="NEOCS Manual"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/nec/NECOSVolII/Pages/default.aspx|title = Navy NEOCS Manual|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electronics Technician Nuclear Power (ETN) ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Nuclear-trained ETNs perform duties in nuclear propulsion plants primarily in operating, maintaining, and repairing reactor instrumentation and control systems. ETNs may be assigned as an operator to a nuclear-powered [[aircraft carriers|aircraft carrier]], as an instructor at a Navy nuclear power training command, or as a [[technician]] at a [[shipyard]] or other nuclear support facility.  Additionally ETNs may volunteer for nuclear [[submarine]] service.  ETNs are the only rating in the Navy that can qualify as a [[reactor operator]] of a [[Nuclear marine propulsion|naval nuclear propulsion plant]].

==== Training ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
ETNs complete several different phases of training in order to be able to operate a naval nuclear propulsion plant.  In order to be selected for nuclear training prospective Navy recruits must have a high enough cutscore on the [[ASVAB|Armed Service Vocational Battery]] (ASVAB) that score being greater than 88 and the [[Navy Advanced Placement Test]] (NAPT) that score being greater than 55%.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Prospective nuclear recruits are then sent to Navy boot camp where prospective nuclear trainees are selected in a 50-30-20 ratio to be trained as nuclear [[Machinist's Mate|machinist's mates]], nuclear [[electricians|electrician's mate]], or nuclear electronics technicians.  Those who are selected to be nuclear electronics technicians then enter the Navy Nuclear Pipeline to train to become an ETN.

In the first stage of training in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, prospective ETNs are trained for six months at the Nuclear Field 'A' School (NFAS) at the [[Naval Nuclear Power Training Command]] (NNPTC) in [[Goose Creek, SC]].  The curriculum at NFAS includes a mathematics refresher course, basic electronics theory, analog electronics theory (EFUNDS), digital electronics theory, and instrumentation and control equipment (I&amp;CE) theory and maintenance.  The curriculum is presented in a high paced manner that ramps up over the term at NFAS in order to prepare students for the difficulties of [[Naval Nuclear Power School|Nuclear Power School]].  The curriculum is very similar to that which is presented to nuclear electricians except that nuclear electricians train in electrical motor and generator theory and maintenance instead of I&amp;CE theory and maintenance.  Due to the specialized training given at NFAS, ETNs who have trained there instead of another ET 'A' school are not qualified to be assigned to billets designed for non-nuclear ETs. Personnel who are disqualified from Navy nuclear work ('de-nuked') or who fail to qualify for Navy nuclear work later in the pipeline are reclassified and retrained into another rating in order to remain in the Navy. ETN is not eligible for direct conversion to ET. This means that for an ETN to become and ET they must attend the ET 'A' school.

In the second stage of training in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, ETNs are trained for six months at the Nuclear Power School at the NNPTC.  The curriculum for ETNs at the Nuclear Power School includes a higher level mathematics (Calculus) refresher course, introduction to nuclear propulsion systems, Navy nuclear mechanical, electrical, and electronics system design, reactor theory, health physics, basic materials science, and chemistry as it applies to nuclear power plants.  The curriculum is similar for MMNs, EMNs, and ETNs, except that each rating focuses more on their particular nuclear system design (for nuclear ETNs this means that they have additional training in nuclear electronics design).

In the third and final stage of training in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, ETNs are trained for six months at one of four Navy [[nuclear prototype training units]] (NPTUs).  Two NPTUs are moored training ships (MTS) using [[S5W]] reactors located at the [[Naval Weapons Station Charleston|Naval Weapons Station]] in Charleston, SC., and two additional NPTUs are land-based prototype units using a [[S7G]] reactor and a [[S8G]] reactor located in [[Saratoga Springs, NY]].  The curriculum for ETNs at an NPTU includes detailed health physics training, design, operation, and maintenance of electronics systems for the NPTU, nuclear watchstanding procedures, and nuclear casualty procedures.  Unlike the first two stages of the Navy Nuclear Pipeline where the curriculum is presented in a typical classroom format, training at an NPTU is self-motivated training where students are required to research different aspects of a nuclear propulsion plant design, operation, or theory and demonstrate this knowledge in an oral interview with a qualified nuclear instructor.  Additionally, ETNs must perform graded watches under the instruction of a qualified nuclear instructor where they operate a particular piece of nuclear equipment or respond to a casualty.  The culmination of training for an ETN is an oral board where an ETN must demonstrate the knowledge of all procedures, equipment, theory expected for a nuclear reactor operator.  Completion of NPTU qualifies an ETN to stand watch on the NPTU or to train to operate nuclear propulsion plants on a nuclear aircraft carrier or submarine.  Additionally, it gives the individual the ETN [[Navy Enlisted Classification]] (NEC), and the individual is then said to be "nuclear qualified."

Upon completion of the Naval Nuclear Pipeline, most nuclear qualified ETNs are sent to nuclear aircraft carriers or nuclear submarines.  On a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, ETNs are sent to a nuclear training division where they train to qualify to operate the nuclear reactors of the ship in a similar way to NPTU for about six months prior to being sent to a reactor control division.  In contrast, on a submarine ETNs are directly assigned to the Reactor Controls division and are directed to qualify different watches incrementally.  Due to the smaller number of personnel on a nuclear submarine, ETNs must also cross qualify on several nuclear electrician watches.  Since ETNs are required to stand watches, perform maintenance, and train and qualify on additional submarine systems, it is not uncommon for it to take over 12 months for an ETN to become fully qualified as a reactor operator, shutdown reactor operator, and all intermediate watches.  Upon subsequent transfer to an NPTU or another nuclear ship, operators are required to re-qualify the same watches in only about 6 months.

Even upon completion of being fully qualified on all ETN watches ("qualified in rate"), additional proficiency and casualty training is required for all ETNs.  On a ship this generally includes general Engineering or Reactor Department training, Reactor Controls division training, periodic exams and interviews, monitored maintenance and operations, periodic watch re-qualifications, and monitored tactical or casualty drills.

Usually after an ETN is "fully qualified" the individual is sent to an "in-rate" technical school [[ETMS]] where the technician studies electronic troubleshooting and repair on shipboard equipment.  Completion of this school allows the technician to be designated with the NEC 3373.

Senior ETNs (typically those who hold the rank of [[petty officer first class]] (E-6) or higher) are expected to qualify for senior supervisory watches.  Self-motivated training for this includes the detailed operations of all nuclear systems on a ship (not just the ETN specific parts) focusing on the big picture view of nuclear operations and casualty response.  The training time required to qualify for senior supervisory watches depends on the individual.

'''Etel Adnan''' ({{lang-ar|إيتيل عدنان}}; born 24 February 1925 in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]) is a Lebanese-American [[poet]], essayist, and [[visual artist]]. In 2003, Adnan was named "arguably the most celebrated and accomplished [[Arab American]] author writing today" by the academic journal ''[[MELUS|MELUS: Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Majaj, Lisa Suhair and Amireh, Amal (Eds.) [http://melus.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/4/229.extract "Etel Adnan: Critical Essays on the Arab-American Writer and Artist"], ''Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States'', Retrieved 12 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides her literary output, Adnan continues to produce visual works in a variety of media, such as oil paintings, films and tapestries, which have been exhibited at galleries across the world.

She lives in Paris and [[Sausalito, California]].&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;[http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2014Biennial/EtelAdnan "Etel Adnan"], The Whitney Museum of American Art, Retrieved 10 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Etel Adnan was born in 1925 in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. &lt;ref&gt;Amyuni, M.T., "The Secret of Being a Woman' on Etel Adnan's Quest," ''Al Jadid'' [A Review &amp; Record of Arab Culture and the Arts], Vol. 4, No. 25,  1998, [https://www.aljadid.com/content/%E2%80%98-secret-being-woman-etel-adnans-quest Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;Adnan's mother was a Christian Greek from Smyrna and her father was Muslim Syrian and a petty officer.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;[http://www.eteladnan.com/ "Etel Adnan: About"] Retrieved 10 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Though she grew up speaking Greek and Turkish in a primarily Arabic-speaking society, she was educated at French convent schools and French became the language in which her early work was first written.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/etel-adnan "Etel Adnan: Biography"] Retrieved 10 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She also studied English in her youth, and most of her later work has been first written in this language.

At 24, Adnan traveled to Paris where she received a degree in philosophy from the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]].&lt;ref name=About/&gt; She then traveled to the United States where she continued graduate studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=About/&gt; From 1952 to 1978, she taught philosophy of art at the [[Dominican University of California]] in San Rafael.&lt;ref name=About/&gt; She has also lectured at many universities throughout the United States.

Adnan returned from the US to Lebanon and worked as a journalist and cultural editor for ''Al-Safa (newspaper0'', a French-language newspaper in Beirut. In addition, she also helped build the cultural section of the newspaper, occasionally contributing cartoons and illustrations. Her tenure at Al-Safa was most notable for her front-page editorials, commenting on the important political issues of the day.&lt;ref name=cca-wattis&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Myers|editor1-first=Julian|editor2-last=Rabben|editor2-first=Heidi|title=The Ninth Page: Etel Adnan's Journalism 1972-74|publisher=CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-9849609-3-4|pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her later years, Adnan began to openly identify as [[lesbian]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Suhair Majaj and Amal Amireh, ''Etel Adnan: Critical Essays on the Arab-American Writer and Artist''. [[McFarland &amp; Company]], 2001. {{ISBN|0786410728}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adnan also works as a painter, her earliest abstract works were created using a palette knife to apply oil paint onto the canvas – often directly from the tube – in firm swipes across the picture's surface. The focus of the compositions often being a red square, she remains interested in the "immediate beauty of colour".&lt;ref name=art&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jan/01/art-to-inspire-ali-smith-alain-de-botton-and-others-on-the-works-they-love&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitecube.com/exhibitions/etel_adnan_inside_the_white_cube_bermondsey_2014/ Etel Adnan, 8 October – 16 November 2014] [[White Cube]], London.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a series of the artist's brightly colored abstract paintings were exhibited as a part of [[Documenta|documenta 13]] in Kassel, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Roberta. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/arts/design/documenta-13-in-kassel-germany.html?pagewanted=all "Art Show as Unruly Organism"] ''The New York Times'', Retrieved 10 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, she began integrating Arabic calligraphy into her artworks and her books, such as ''Livres d’Artistes'' [Artist’s Books]. She recalls sitting for hours copying words from an Arabic grammar without trying to understand the meaning of the words. Her art is very much influenced by early hurufiyya artists including; Iraqi artist, [[Jawad Salim]], Palestinian writer and artist, [[Jabra Ibrahim Jabra]] and Iraqi painter [[Shakir Hassan al Said]], who rejected Western aesthetics and embraced a new art form which was both modern and yet referenced traditional culture, media and techniques. &lt;ref&gt;Quilty, J., "Arabic art embraces politics and heritage,' ''The Daily Star, 24 April, 2003, Online: http://www.dailystar.com.lb/ArticlePrint.aspx?id=102634&amp;mode=print&lt;/ref&gt; 

Inspired by Japanese leporellos, Adnan also paints landscapes on to foldable screens that can be "extended in space like free-standing drawings".&lt;ref name=art/&gt;

In 2014, a collection of the artist's paintings and tapestries were exhibited as a part of the Whitney Biennial at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref name=Whitney/&gt;

Etel Adnan's retrospective at [[Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art]] in Doha, titled "Etel Adnan In All Her Dimensions" and curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, featured eleven dimensions of Adnan's practice. It included her early works, her literature, her carpets, and other. The show was launched in March 2014, accompanied by a 580-page catalog of her work published jointly by Mathaf and Skira. The catalog was designed by artist [[Ala Younis]] in Arabic and English, and included text contributions by Simone Fattal, [[Daniel Birnbaum]], Kaelen Wilson-Goldie, as well as six interviews with [[Hans-Ulrich Obrist]].

'''Florin Fodor''' (born 1974) is a citizen of [[Romania]] who made several attempts to enter [[Canada]] illegally. His last incursion was seen as remarkable, as he was the first [[illegal immigration|undocumented immigrant]] to attempt to slip into Canada surreptitiously through its vast and underpopulated [[Arctic]].&lt;ref name=CIReport/&gt;&lt;ref name=CanadianShipper/&gt;

Fodor was first deported from Canada in 2000.&lt;ref name=SikuNews2006-11-12/&gt;
He was deported again in 2006, when he is reported to have been returning to family in Canada.

According to [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] [[Corporal]] Tim Waters, Fodor's attempt to enter Canada by water, from [[Greenland]], was unprecedented—and dangerous.&lt;ref name=SikuNews2006-11-12/&gt;

Fodor left [[Sisimiut]], Greenland on September 11, 2006, in a 20-foot fibreglass boat he purchased there.&lt;ref name=SikuNews2006-11-12/&gt; He arrived at [[Grise Fiord]] eight days later, on September 18, 2006.&lt;ref name=Cbc20081115&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;
When Fodor arrived in Grise Fiord he was almost out of food, and had only five litres ({{convert|5|l|USgal|disp=output only}}) of fuel left.

Fodor pleaded guilty in November 2006 to two charges of violating Canada's Immigration Act.&lt;ref name=SikuNews2006-11-22/&gt; He was sentenced to seven and a half months of detention.
Justice [[Lise Maisonneuve]] ruled that Fodor should be deported when his sentence was complete.&lt;ref name=MontrealGazette2006-11-22/&gt;&lt;ref name=OttawaCitizen20081121&gt;{{cite news

Nunavut's Premier, [[Eva Aariak]], cited Grise Fjord's apprehension of Fodor in a speech she delivered to the Nunavut Legislature on February 19, 2009.&lt;ref name=EvaAariak-2009-02-19&gt;

Federal Ministers [[Chuck Strahl]] and [[Leona Aglukkaq]] were guests of the Legislature.  In her speech Aariak cited Fodor's example as a demonstration of how important the people of Nunavut were to protecting Canadian sovereignty.

'''Frances of Rome, Obl.S.B.''', ({{lang-it|'''Santa Francesca Romana'''}}) (1384 – March 9, 1440) is an Italian [[saint]] who was a wife, mother, [[mysticism|mystic]], organizer of charitable services and a [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[oblate]] who founded a religious community of oblates, who share a common life without [[religious vows]].

== Life ==
Frances was born in 1384 in Rome to a wealthy and [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] couple, Paolo Bussa and Iacobella dei Roffredeschi, in the up-and-coming [[rioni of Rome|district]] of [[Parione]] and [[baptism|christened]] in the nearby [[Sant'Agnese in Agone|Church of St. Agnes]] on the famed [[Piazza Navona]].&lt;ref&gt;Life of St. Frances on the website of her monastery {{it icon}} [http://www.tordespecchi.it/public/index.php?Storia:Santa_Francesca_Romana]&lt;/ref&gt; When she was eleven years old, she wanted to be a [[nun]], but, at about the age of twelve, her parents forced her to marry Lorenzo Ponziani, commander of the [[Papal States|papal]] troops of Rome and member of an extremely wealthy family. Although the marriage had been arranged, it was a happy one, lasting for forty years, partly because Lorenzo admired his wife, and partly because he was frequently away at war.

With her sister-in-law Vannozza, Frances visited the poor and took care of the sick, inspiring other wealthy women of the city to do the same. Soon after her marriage, Frances fell seriously ill. Her husband called a man in who dabbled in magic, but Frances drove him away, and later recounted to Vannozza that St. Alexis had appeared to her and cured her.&lt;ref name=habig&gt;[http://www.franciscan-sfo.org/sts/S0309rome.htm Habig O.F.M., Marion. ''The Franciscan Book of Saints'', Franciscan Herald Press, 1959]&lt;/ref&gt;

When her mother-in-law died, Frances became mistress of the household. During a time of flood and famine, she turned part of the family's country estate into a hospital&lt;ref name=foley&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1317 Foley O.F.M., Leonard. ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons and Feast'', (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F.M.), Franciscan Media]&lt;/ref&gt; and distributed food and clothing to the poor. According to one account, her father-in-law was so angry that he took away from her the keys to the supply rooms; but gave them back when he saw that the corn bin and wine barrel were replenished after Frances finished praying.

During the wars between the pope in Rome and various [[anti-popes]] in the [[Western Schism]] of the Catholic Church, Lorenzo served the former. According to one story, their son Battista was to be delivered as a hostage to the commander of the Neapolitan troops. Obeying this order on the command of her [[spiritual director]], Frances took her son to the [[Campidoglio]]. On the way, she stopped in the Church of the [[Aracoeli]] located there and entrusted her son's life to the [[Blessed Mother]]. When they arrived at the appointed site, the soldiers tried to put her son on a horse to transport him to captivity. However, the horse refused to move despite heavy whipping. The superstitious soldiers saw the hand of God in this and returned the boy to his mother.&lt;ref name=lady&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o9kCAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR58&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fullerton, Georgiana Charlotte. ''The life of St. Frances of Rome'', Chap V, Burns and Lambert, 1855]&lt;/ref&gt;

During a period of forced exile, much of Lorenzo's property and possessions were destroyed.&lt;ref name=paoli&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06205c.htm Paoli, Francesco. "St. Frances of Rome." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 31 Jan. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of one occupation of Rome by [[Naples|Neapolitan]] forces in the early part of the century, he was wounded so severely that he never fully recovered. Frances nursed him throughout the rest of his life.

Frances experienced other sorrows during her marriage to Lorenzo. They lost two children to the plague. Chaos ruled the city in that period of neglect by the pope and the ongoing warfare between him and the various forces competing for power on the Italian peninsula devastated the city. The city of Rome was largely in ruins, and wolves were known to enter the streets. Frances again opened her home as a hospital and drove her wagon through the countryside to collect wood for fire and herbs for medicine.&lt;ref name=Loyola&gt;[http://www.loyolapress.com/saint-frances-of-rome.htm#sthash.a7gexU9H.dpbs "Saint Frances of Rome", Loyola Press]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said she had the gift of healing, and over 60 cases were attested to during the canonization proceedings.&lt;ref name=lady/&gt;

According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], "With her husband's consent St. Frances practiced [[wikt:continence|continence]], and advanced in a life of [[contemplation]]. Her visions often assumed the form of drama enacted for her by heavenly personages. She had the [[gift of miracles]] and ecstasy, as well as the bodily vision of her [[Guardian angel (spirit)|guardian angel]], had revelations concerning [[Purgatory]] and [[Hell]], and foretold the ending of the Western Schism. She could read the secrets of consciences and detect plots of [[Evil|diabolical]] origin. She was remarkable for her humility and detachment, her obedience and patience".&lt;ref name=paoli/&gt;

On August 15, 1425, the feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]], she founded the [[Olivetan]] [[Oblate]]s of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]], a [[confraternity]] of pious women, under the authority of the Olivetan [[monk]]s of the Abbey of [[Santa Maria Nova]] in Rome, but neither cloistered nor bound by formal vows, so they could follow her pattern of combining a life of prayer with answering the needs of their society.&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite book|last=Farmer|first=David Hugh|title=The Oxford dictionary of saints|year=1997|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=0-19-280058-2|pages=191|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1433 she founded a [[monastery]] at [[Tor de Specchi Monastery|Tor de' Specchi]], near the Campidoglio, in order to allow for a common life by those members of the confraternity who felt so called.&lt;ref name=lady/&gt; This monastery remains the only house of the Institute. That July 4, they received the approval of [[Pope Eugene IV]] as a [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]] of oblates with private [[religious vows]]. The community later became known simply as the Oblates of St. Frances of Rome.

Frances herself remained in her own home, nursing her husband for the last seven years of his life from wounds he had received in battle. When he died in 1436, she moved into the monastery and became the superior.&lt;ref name=paoli/&gt; She died in 1440 and was buried in Santa Maria Nova.

==Veneration==
On May 9, 1608, she was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Paul V]],&lt;ref name=habig/&gt; and in the following decades a diligent search was made for her remains, which had been hidden due to the troubled times in which she lived. Her body was found incorrupt some months after her death. Her grave was identified on April 2, 1638, (but this time only the bones remained), and her remains were reburied in the Church of Santa Maria Nova on March 9, 1649, which since then has been her [[feast day]]. Again, in 1869, her body was [[exhumation|exhumed]] and has since then been displayed in a glass coffin for the [[veneration]] of the faithful. The Church of Santa Maria Nova is now usually referred to as the Church of St. Frances.

===Patronage===
In 1925, [[Pope Pius XI]] declared her the [[patron saint]] of automobile drivers because of a legend that an angel used to light the road before her with a lantern when she traveled, keeping her safe from hazards. Within the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine Order]], she is honored as a patron saint of all oblates. She is also a patron saint of widows.

'''Frederic De Frouville''' (Virginia, ca.1850 – April 4, 1883) was an American noted for committing a murder-suicide in [[Washington, DC]]. De Frouville murdered his estranged wife, Andrea De Frouville, née Andrea Marie Wolstrup in Denmark, on April 4, 1883, and then shot and killed himself. She had legally separated from him the previous November because of his heavy drinking and abuse of her.

==Early life and education==
Frederic De Frouville was born about 1850&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Federal Census, 1880, Washington, D.C. (National Archives, Film No. T9-0124, p.&amp;nbsp;97C&lt;/ref&gt; in Virginia.&lt;ref name="Star4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/PDF/Obits/D/Obits_Defrouville.pdf |title="A Shocking Double Tragedy; A Husband Murders His Wife and Then Commits Suicide" |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050516064520/http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/PDF/Obits/D/Obits_Defrouville.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2005 |df= }}, ''[[Washington Evening Star]],'' 4 April 1883, at "Andrea De Frouville", Congressional Cemetery Obituary Archive, accessed 27 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Frederick De Frouville, a French national who had emigrated to the United States in the 1840s and became a citizen in 1848, and his mother was Orsena Bestor of [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]]. He also had a sister.&lt;ref name="Star5Two"/&gt;

By his maternal aunt Maria L. Bestor's marriage, the younger Frederic was a nephew of [[Aaron Van Camp]]. The dentist served as a spy in Washington, DC for the [[Confederate States of America]] during the Civil War.

==Career==
De Frouville worked for a time in [[New Orleans]] at the United States custom house. He returned to Washington, DC about 1873 and worked in various capacities in the capital. In 1877, at the time of his marriage, he worked in the Signal Corps, but was dismissed because of his repeated episodes of heavy drinking (described as "dissipation" in articles of the time).&lt;ref name="Star4"/&gt; He later entered the Coastal Survey (today's [[Coast Guard]]). Due to his drinking, he was dismissed from this job as well.&lt;ref name="Star4"/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
On September 12, 1877, in Baltimore, De Frouville married Andrea Marie Wolstrup, an immigrant from [[Denmark]] who had come to Washington, DC in 1871.&lt;ref name="Star4"/&gt; She left a sister and half-brother behind.&lt;ref name="Star7"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/PDF/Obits/D/Obits_Defrouville.pdf |title="Mrs. DeFrouville's Estate" |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050516064520/http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/PDF/Obits/D/Obits_Defrouville.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2005 |df= }}, ''The Evening Star,'' 7 April 1883, accessed 28 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Her friends had recommended against her marriage to De Frouville because they considered him too wild and reckless.&lt;ref name="Star4"/&gt;

Wolstrup, recognized as an "excellent linguist," was then working as a translator in the Dead Letter office of the US Post Office.&lt;ref name="Star4"/&gt; She had been aided in finding work by Col. [[Charles Christopher Sheats|Charles C. Sheats]], then the US Consul to Elsinore, Denmark, whom she had met on the ship to the United States. (In 1872 he was elected to Congress as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] representative from Alabama.)&lt;ref name="Star4"/&gt; After her marriage, Andrea De Frouville continued to work at the Post Office under her maiden name. She resigned after becoming pregnant, but the child died soon after birth.&lt;ref name="Star4"/&gt;

Andrea De Frouville obtained a separation from her husband in November 1882 and started divorce proceedings because of his heavy drinking and abuse of her.&lt;ref name="Star4"/&gt; Their marriage had been troubled for some time, and she had first consulted a lawyer about a separation in 1879 due to her husband's abuse.&lt;ref name="Star5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/PDF/Obits/D/Obits_Defrouville.pdf |title="The De Frouville Tragedy: Matrimonial Troubles of Long Standing" |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050516064520/http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/PDF/Obits/D/Obits_Defrouville.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2005 |df= }}, ''Evening Star,'' 5 April 1883, at "Andrea De Frouville"], Congressional Cemetery Obituary Archive, accessed 27 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
After the separation, she gained a clerkship as a translator in the Department of Agriculture due to the recommendation of Senator [[Hill]]. Friends warned her of De Frouville's threats against her in the weeks before her death, and her attorney advised her to have him arrested.&lt;ref name="Star4"/&gt;

==Background==
At the time of the [[murder/suicide]], Andrea De Frouville, a skilled [[linguist]], worked as a [[translator]] in the US Department of Agriculture. She had gained the job in 1882 by the recommendation of the Senator [[Benjamin Harvey Hill]] of Georgia, who died later that year.&lt;ref name="Star7"/&gt;

An [[inquest]] determined that Andrea De Frouville was giving German lessons to an 18-year-old neighbor, George W. Buckingham, when her estranged husband entered her residence. The youth testified that Mrs. De Frouville asked him to get the police and he escaped out the back door. Her husband shot her in the head, killing her, and then shot himself with the same revolver before Buckingham could return with police.&lt;ref name="Star7"/&gt;

After the inquest, Andrea De Frouville was buried in the [[Congressional Cemetery]] and Frederic De Frouville in [[Glenwood Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Glenwood Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="Star5Two"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/PDF/Obits/D/Obits_Defrouville.pdf |title="The Two Funerals Today" |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050516064520/http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/PDF/Obits/D/Obits_Defrouville.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2005 |df= }}, ''The Evening Star,'' 5 April 1883, accessed 28 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Froia''' was a [[Visigothic]] nobleman, probably a count, who rebelled and tried to seize the kingship in 653, either in the final weeks of the reign of [[Chindasuinth]] or in the opening weeks of that of his son, [[Reccesuinth]].

He had the support of the [[Basques]] in the upper [[Ebro valley]], where he had a small circle of supporters. He besieged [[Zaragoza]], where the bishop [[Taius]] was whiling away at a revision of the ''[[Lex Visigothorum]]'', unable to leave the city. Reccesuinth led an army to put down the revolt in person and force the Basques back into the mountains.

'''George Roby Dempster'''  (September 16, 1887 &amp;ndash; September 18, 1964) was an American businessman, [[inventor]], and politician, active primarily in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], during the first half of the twentieth century.  Dempster is best known for the invention of the Dempster-Dumpster, a now-commonly-used [[dumpster|trash receptacle]] that can be mechanically emptied into garbage trucks.  During the 1910s and 1920s, the Dempster Brothers Construction Company, operated by Dempster and his brothers, built a number of roads and railroads across the Southern [[Appalachia]]n region.&lt;ref name=deaderick&gt;East Tennessee Historical Society, Lucile Deaderick (ed.), ''Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 519-521.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dempster also served as a [[city manager]] and [[mayor]] of Knoxville, where he became legendary for his political battles with eccentric Knoxville businessman [[Cas Walker]] and ''Knoxville Journal'' editor Guy Smith, Jr.&lt;ref name=wheeler&gt;Bruce Wheeler, ''Knoxville, Tennessee: A Mountain City in the New South'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2005), pp. 73-82, 111-113, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Dempster was born in 1887, the ninth child of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] immigrant John Dempster and [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrant Ann Doherty.  John Dempster co-managed Scott, Dempster and Company, a [[gristmill]]ing firm that operated a mill along First Creek.  As a teenager, George Dempster travelled around the country working odd jobs for various companies, including the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]], the Atlanta, Birmingham and Atlantic Railroad, and the [[Ward Line]] shipping company.  A railroad strike in 1903 left him briefly stranded in a [[hobo]] colony in [[Iowa]].&lt;ref name=tumblin /&gt;  Dempster graduated from the Girls High School in Knoxville in 1906, having served as the school's class president.&lt;ref name=deaderick /&gt;

After high school, Dempster worked as a [[steam shovel]] operator on the [[Panama Canal]] project, helping to excavate the canal's [[Miraflores (Panama)|Miraflores]] and Pedro Miguel [[lock (water transport)|locks]].&lt;ref name=tumblin /&gt;  During the project, Dempster nearly lost his life on several occasions when rock slides caused his steam shovel to flip over.  He also contracted [[typhoid fever]], and bickered with famed physician [[William C. Gorgas]] over the most effective treatment.&lt;ref name=tumblin /&gt;  One of Dempster's earliest innovations was a device that allowed his shovel's dipper to mechanically empty its load.&lt;ref name=tumblin /&gt;

===Business career===
After returning to Knoxville, Dempster, along with his brothers, Thomas and John, formed the Dempster Brothers Construction Company, which helped build roads, railroads, and small dams in Tennessee, [[North Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Virginia]], and [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=deaderick /&gt;  While initially lucrative, the company was forced into bankruptcy at the onset of the [[Great Depression]].  Dempster's [[Fountain City, Tennessee|Fountain City]] home (still standing at the corner of Broadway and Gibbs) was auctioned off to help cover his debts.&lt;ref name=tumblin /&gt;

In spite of these setbacks, Dempster and his brothers reorganized their remaining resources to form [[Dempster Brothers]], Inc., which focused on heavy machinery.&lt;ref name=deaderick /&gt;  In 1935, the company introduced the "Dempster-Dumpster," the first large-scale waste container that could be mechanically emptied into a garbage truck.  As orders for this new product poured in from around the world, the company devoted all of its resources to the production of Dempster-Dumpsters.&lt;ref name=tumblin /&gt;  In 1939, the company introduced the Dempster-Balester, which crushed and baled automobiles.&lt;ref name=tumblin /&gt;  During [[World War II]], the company produced [[pontoon boat]]s and other equipment for the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref name=deaderick /&gt;  The company introduced the [[Dempster Dumpmaster]], the first front-loading garbage truck, in the 1950s.

The Dempster Brothers plant on Springdale Avenue in Knoxville consisted of eleven buildings on {{convert|27|acre|ha}}, and employed 450 workers.&lt;ref name=tumblin /&gt;  For humanitarian purposes, the plant employed a large number of handicapped workers.  The plant served as a training ground of sorts for welders and machinists who would later work on nearby [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] projects.&lt;ref name=tumblin /&gt;

===Knoxville politics===

Dempster, a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], became actively involved in Knoxville politics during the 1920s.  In 1929, he was named city manager, a position created earlier in the decade.  After his appointment, he convinced the state legislature to merge the offices of city manager and mayor.  This move proved unpopular, and Dempster was defeated by W. W. Mynatt in the mayoral election of 1937.  Dempster continued to lead the opposition to Mynatt, forming an alliance with Knoxville businessman Cas Walker, who had a strong populist backing in the city.&lt;ref name=wheeler /&gt;

During the 1930s, while city manager, Dempster began to clash with Guy Smith, Jr., editor of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-leaning ''Knoxville Journal''.  Smith once stated that Dempster should be "relegated to the political ash heap and buried so deeply that one of his own Dumpsters can't dig him out."&lt;ref name=wheeler /&gt;  Dempster, likewise, quietly ordered the police to scour the city for Smith's car, and tow it away if it was illegally parked (which it often was).  Smith ordered ''Journal'' photographers to crop Dempster from favorable group shots, and Dempster organized a raid that caught ''Journal'' owner Roy Lotspeich with a large supply of [[illegal whiskey]].&lt;ref name=wheeler /&gt;

Running on an anti-tax platform, Dempster's allies managed to recapture the mayor's office in 1945, and Dempster was again appointed city manager.  Dempster broke his campaign pledge, and proposed new city property taxes.  This provoked the ire of Walker, who immediately mounted a campaign against Dempster.  Walker blasted Dempster's new taxes, and claimed that "gambling, whiskey and prostitution" flourished when Dempster was in power.&lt;ref name=wheeler /&gt;  After Walker was elected mayor in 1946, Dempster resigned as city manager.  Walker's new city manager, Paul Morton, accused Dempster of [[cronyism]], and undid most of Dempster's contracts and pay raises.&lt;ref name=wheeler /&gt;

Walker's term as mayor proved tumultuous, and Dempster's allies managed to oust Walker in a [[recall election]] in 1947.  Dempster was elected mayor in 1951.  His tenure was largely stagnant, as two major textile mills closed, and the downtown area declined with the rise of suburban shopping centers.  After he proposed a modest tax increase, Knoxvillians revolted, and voted him out of office in 1955.&lt;ref name=wheeler /&gt;

===State politics===
Dempster served as campaign manager for [[Henry Hollis Horton|Henry Horton]]'s gubernatorial campaign in 1928, and was subsequently appointed the state's commissioner of finance and taxation.  In 1932, he was appointed to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] Commission, which was responsible for buying land for the national park.  Dempster ran for governor in 1940, and lost in the primaries to [[Prentice Cooper]].&lt;ref name=deaderick /&gt;

===Later life===
Dempster was named a delegate to the [[1956 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], although he largely retired from city politics after his defeat in 1955.&lt;ref name=deaderick /&gt;  He later rejoined his old nemesis Cas Walker in a successful attempt to thwart city-county consolidation, which was soundly rejected by Knoxville and Knox County voters in a 1959 referendum.&lt;ref name=wheeler /&gt;  Dempster died of a heart attack on September 18, 1964.  Over one thousand mourners, among them U.S. senators [[Al Gore, Sr.]], and [[Herbert S. Walters]], crowded into the St. James Episcopal Church for Dempster's funeral.&lt;ref name=tumblin /&gt;  He was buried next to his wife in Greenwood Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Buildings constructed during Dempster's tenures as city manager and mayor include the [[Henley Street Bridge]], the Church Avenue and Fifth Avenue [[viaduct]]s, four public library branches, and [[Bill Meyer Stadium]].  He also convinced the city to buy [[Chilhowee Park]] and Tyson Park.&lt;ref name=tumblin&gt;Jim Tumblin, "[http://www.fountaincitytnhistory.info/People7-Dempster.htm Fountain Citians Who Made a Difference &amp;ndash; George R. Dempster].  2002.  Retrieved: 3 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dempster built several houses in Knoxville, some of which still stand in Fountain City and [[Old North Knoxville]].&lt;ref name=tumblin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann Bennett, National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form for Old North Knoxville Historic District, 9 August 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dempster hired the city's first African-American civil service secretary, and supported desegregation in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name=tumblin /&gt;  He championed a number causes in support of the handicapped and the blind, including a radio program that featured blind pianists.&lt;ref name=tumblin /&gt;  He was given the Father Abram Ryan Award by the [[Knights of Columbus]] in recognition of his civil service shortly before his death.&lt;ref name=deaderick /&gt;

Born at Dubrovka, [[Ukraine]], a part of the [[Russian Empire]], in 1897, Levchenko joined the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in 1913 and participated in [[World War I]]. 

Levchenko became a member of the [[Bolshevik Party]] in 1919. During the Civil War he participated in suppressing the mutinies at the [[Krasnaya Gorka fort]] and the [[Kronstadt Rebellion]]. He was promoted to command the ''Aurora'' in 1922, and held command of the [[Caspian Flotilla]] in 1932 - 1933. From 1933 he commanded the battleship division of the [[Baltic Fleet]] and the destroyer squadron of the [[Black Sea Fleet]]. He was arrested during a purge in late 1941 and sentenced to 10 years, but released in January 1942 and re-instated. Levchenko participated in battles of [[Odessa]], [[Nikolayev (Ukraine)|Nikolayev]] and [[Sevastopol]] during [[World War II]]. From late 1942 to 1944 he was base commander in Leningrad and helped supply the city during the [[Siege of Leningrad|siege]].

He was  commander of the [[Baltic Fleet]] from 1946 to 1953. Levchenko was deputy of the [[People's Commissar]] of the navy from 1939 and deputy minister of the navy from 1953 to 1960.

'''Hannah Hurnard''' (1905–90) is a 20th-century Christian author, best known for her [[allegory|allegorical]] novel, ''[[Hinds' Feet on High Places]]''.
==Biography==
Hurnard was born in 1905 in [[Colchester]], England, to [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] parents. She graduated from [[Ridgelands Bible College]] in 1926. In 1932 she became an independent [[missionary]], moving to [[Haifa]], Palestine. Her work in Palestine and later Israel lasted 50 years, although she would later maintain a home in England as well.

Hurnard's early writings (especially ''Hinds' Feet on High Places'' and the sequel ''Mountain of Spices'') were embraced by the mainstream Christian community, but later on in her life she seems to have departed from orthodoxy.

''[[Eagles' Wings to the Higher Places]]'' has been said to support non-orthodox beliefs in [[pantheism]], [[Christian Universalism|universalism]], and [[gnosticism]].{{Fact|date=January 2008}} ''Unveiled Glory'' tells of how she came to believe in [[Universal reconciliation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tentmaker.org/testimonials/hannahhurnard.htm Hannah Hurnard: Unveiled Glory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hiawatha Thompson Estes''' (January 26, 1918 – May 8, 2003) was a [[California]]-based [[architect]] and author known for designing a large number of variations of the ubiquitous post-war ranch home,  [[mass marketing]] plans of them, and publishing a number of books dealing with residential architecture.

Estes was a [[Chickasaw]] Indian Nation member. He graduated from the [[University of Oklahoma]] and served in [[World War II]] as a captain in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] 37th Fighter Squadron.

After the war, Estes founded "Architectural House and Plan Business, Nationwide Plan Book", which was to evolve into Hiawatha Estes and Associates. Estes was a resident of [[Northridge, California]], a neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]], and remarkable for the number and diversity of ranch homes, some of which are Hiawatha Estes designs. Estes was related to Senator Helen TeAta Cole, his cousin, also of [[Oklahoma]].

'''Ivan Alekseevich Kuratov''' ({{Lang-ru|Иван Алексеевич Куратов}}; {{OldStyleDate|18 July|1839|6 July}} in Kibra village, current Kuratovo village, [[Komi Republic]] &amp;mdash; {{OldStyleDate|29 November|1875|17 November}} in Verny, current [[Almaty]]) was a [[Komis|Komi]] [[poet]] and [[Linguistics|linguist]], seen as renovator of Komi literature.

Kuratov began writing verses at age 13, while studying in a [[seminary]], and was engaged in poetry until his death. The most fruitful period of his life were the years spent in the town of [[Ust-Sysolsk]], where Kuratov settled after unsuccessful attempt to continue his education in Moscow. Here he taught country children, worked on linguistics and wrote poetry. During his lifetime Ivan Kuratov published only five poems, under a pseudonym.

He is the subject of [[Serge Noskov]]'s 2009 opera ''[[Kuratov (opera)|Kuratov]]'', the first in the Komi language.

[[File:Brugghen, Hendrick ter - Esau Selling His Birthright - c. 1627.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], ''Esau Selling His Birthright'', c. 1627.]]
The [[Book of Genesis]] speaks of the relationship between fraternal twins '''Jacob and Esau''', sons of [[Isaac]] and Rebekah, focusing on [[Esau]]'s loss of his birthright to [[Jacob]] and the conflict that ensued between their descendant nations because of Jacob's deception of their aged and blind father, Isaac, in order to receive Esau's birthright/blessing from Isaac.

This conflict was paralleled by the affection the parents had for their favored child: "Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but [[Rebecca|Rebekah]] loved Jacob." ({{bibleverse||Genesis|25:28|NIV}}). Even since conception, their conflict was foreshadowed: "And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the Lord. And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger." ({{bibleverse||Genesis|25:22–23|HE}})

This passage in {{bibleverse||Genesis|25:26|HE}} is as if Jacob was seemingly trying to pull Esau back into the womb so that he could be firstborn.&lt;ref name = "Harper, 40"&gt;Attridge &amp; Meeks. ''The Harper Collins Study Bible'', ({{ISBN|0060786841}}, {{ISBN|978-0-06-078684-7}} ), 2006, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The ''grasping of the heel'' is also a reference to deceptive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 25:26, NIV footnote&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birthright==
[[File:Tissot The Mess of Pottage.jpg|thumb|The Mess of Pottage (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by [[James Tissot]])]]

In Genesis, Esau returned to his brother, Jacob, being famished from the fields. He begged his twin brother to give him some "red [[pottage]]" (paralleling his nickname, {{lang-he|אדום}} (''adom'', meaning "red"). Jacob offered to give Esau a bowl of stew in exchange for his birthright (the right to be recognized as firstborn) and Esau agreed.&lt;ref name=duffy&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05527c.htm Duffy, Daniel. "Esau." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 12 Jul. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The birthright (''bekorah'') has to do with both position and inheritance. By birthright, the firstborn son inherited the leadership of the family and the judicial authority of his father. Deuteronomy 21:17 states that he was also entitled to a double portion of the paternal inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, M.G. ''Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', Third Ed., Thomas Nelson, 1897&lt;/ref&gt; 

Esau acts impulsively. As he did not value his birthright over a bowl of lentil stew, by his actions, Esau demonstrates that he does not deserve to be the one who continues Abraham's responsibilities and rewards under God's covenant, since he does not have the steady, thoughtful qualities which are required.&lt;ref name=elazar&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles/jacob-esau.htm Elazar, Daniel J., "Jacob and Esau and the Emergence of the Jewish People", Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Horst, Gerrit Willemsz. - Isaac blessing Jacob - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Horst, Gerrit Willemsz. - Isaac blessing Jacob]]
Jacob shows his wiliness as well as his greater intelligence and [[forethought]]. What he does is not quite honorable, though not illegal. The birthright benefit that he gains is at least partially valid, although he is insecure enough about it to conspire later with his mother to deceive his father so as to gain the blessing for the first-born as well.&lt;ref name=elazar/&gt;{{how|date=May 2017}}

Later, Esau marries two wives, both [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] women, that is, locals, in violation of Abraham's (and God's) injunction not to take wives from among the Canaanite population. Again, one gets the sense of a headstrong person who acts impulsively, without sufficient thought ({{bibleverse||Genesis|26:34–35|HE}}). His marriage is described as a vexation to both Rebekah and Isaac. Even his father, who has strong affection for him, is hurt by his act. According to Daniel J. Elazar this action alone forever rules out Esau as the bearer of patriarchal continuity. Esau could have overcome the sale of his birthright; Isaac was still prepared to give him the blessing due the firstborn. But acquiring foreign wives meant the detachment of his children from the Abrahamic line. Despite the deception on the part of Jacob and his mother to gain Isaac's patriarchal blessing, Jacob's vocation as Isaac's legitimate heir in the continued founding of the Jewish people is reaffirmed. Elazar suggests that the Bible indicates that a bright, calculating person who, at times, is less than honest, is preferable as a founder over a bluff, impulsive one who cannot make discriminating choices.&lt;ref name=elazar/&gt;

==Blessing of the firstborn==
Pronouncing the blessing was considered to be the act formally acknowledging the firstborn as the principal heir.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/firstborn "Firstborn", Jewish Virtual Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Genesis 27:5–7, Rebecca overhears Isaac tell Esau, "Bring me venison and prepare a savory food, that I may eat, and bless thee before the Lord before my death." Rebecca councils Jacob to pretend to be Esau, in order to obtain the blessing in his brother's stead. He dressed himself in Esau's best clothes and disguised himself by covering his arms in lamb skin so that if his blind father touched him, he would think Jacob his more hirsute brother. Jacob brought Isaac a dish of goat meat prepared by Rebecca to taste like venison. Isaac then bestowed the blessing (''bekhorah''), which confers a prophetic wish for fertility (vv. 27–28) and dominion (v.29), on Jacob before Esau's return.

Esau is furious and vows to kill Jacob ({{bibleverse||Genesis|27:41|HE}}) as soon as their father has died. Rebekah intervenes to save her younger son Jacob from being murdered by her elder son, Esau.&lt;ref name=je&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5846-esau "Esau", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; At Rebekah's urging, Jacob flees to a distant land to work for his mother's brother, [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|28:5|HE}}). She explains to Isaac that she has sent Jacob to find a wife among her own people.

Jacob does not immediately receive his father's inheritance. Jacob, having fled for his life, leaves behind the wealth of Isaac's flocks and land and tents in Esau's hands. Jacob is forced to sleep out on the open ground and then work for wages as a servant in Laban's household. Jacob, who had deceived his father, is in turn deceived and cheated by his relative Laban concerning Jacob's seven years of service (lacking money for a dowry) for the hand of Laban's daughter [[Rachel]], receiving his older daughter [[Leah]] instead.&lt;ref name=manns&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Newsletters/SFS/an0803.asp Manns OFM, Frederick. "Jacob and Esau: Rebecca's Children", American Catholic.org.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224103944/http://www.americancatholic.org/Newsletters/SFS/an0803.asp |date=2013-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, despite Laban, Jacob eventually becomes so rich as to incite the envy of Laban and Laban's sons.
[[File:Rubens Reconciliation of Jacob and Esau.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Peter Paul Rubens]], ''The Reconciliation of Jacob and Esau'', 1624.]]

==Reconciliation==
{{bible verse||Genesis|32–33|HE}} tells of Jacob and Esau's eventual meeting according to God's commandment in {{bible verse||Genesis|31:3, 32:10|HE}} after Jacob had spent more than 20 years staying with Laban in Padan-Aram. The two men prepare for their meeting like warriors about to enter into battle. Jacob divides his family into two camps such that if one is taken the other might escape ({{bible verse||Genesis|32:8-9|HE}}). Jacob sends messengers to Esau, as well as gifts meant to appease him.&lt;ref name=manns/&gt; Jacob gets the name ''Israel'' after he wrestles with the Angel of God as he is traveling to Esau. His hip is knocked out of joint but he keeps on wrestling and gains the name.&lt;ref&gt;In Biblical Hebrew the name "[[wikt:Israel|Israel]]" means ''one who wrestles with God''. See also [[Jacob's Ladder]].&lt;/ref&gt; After the encounter with the angel, Jacob crosses over the ford Jabbok and encounters Esau who seems initially pleased to see him ({{bible verse||Genesis|33:4|HE}}), which attitude of favour Jacob fosters by means of his gift. Esau refuses the gift at first but Jacob humbles himself before his brother and presses him to take it, which he finally does ({{bible verse||Genesis|33:3, 33:10-11|HE}}). However, Jacob evidently does not trust his brother's favour to continue for long so he makes excuses to avoid traveling to Mount Seir in Esau's company ({{bible verse||Genesis|33:12-14|HE}}), and he further evades Esau's attempt to put his own men among Jacob's bands ({{bible verse||Genesis|33:15-16|HE}}), and finally completes the deception of his brother yet again by going to Succoth and then to Shalem, a city of Shechem, instead of following Esau at a distance to Seir ({{bible verse||Genesis|33:16-20|HE}}). The next time Jacob and Esau meet is at the burial of their father, Isaac, in Hebron ({{bible verse||Genesis|35:27-29|HE}}). The so-called reconciliation is thus only superficial and temporary.

==Views of the Birthright==

The narrative of Esau selling his birthright to Jacob, in {{bibleverse||Genesis|25|HE}}, states that Esau despised his birthright. However, it also alludes to Jacob being thrifty.

In Esau's mother and father's eyes, the deception may have been deserved.  Rebekah later abets Jacob in receiving his father's blessing disguised as Esau. Isaac then refuses to take Jacob's blessing back after learning he was tricked, and does not give this blessing to Esau but, after Esau begs, gives him an inferior blessing ({{bibleverse||Genesis|27:34–40|HE}}).

In the [[book of Ether]] in the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Jared''' was the name of the primary ancestor of the [[Jaredite]]s.  He, [[Brother of Jared|his brother]], their families and their friends came to the "promised land" (the [[Americas]]) shortly after the [[Tower of Babel]]. Jared is also the name of a later [[Jaredite]] king who dethroned his father, [[Lineage of Ether#Reign of Omer|Omer]].

'''José Ramón Fernández Álvarez''' (born November 4, 1923) is a [[Cuba]]n [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist]] leader who is a Vice-President of the [[Cuban Council of Ministers|Council of Ministers]].

==Pre-Revolution life==
Fernández was born in [[Santiago de Cuba]],  where he studied his first and second education. In 1947 he graduated from the Cadet School of Cuba and also from the Artillery School as well as from other courses of the General Staff in Cuba and at [[Fort Sill]] in the USA.

From March 10, 1952, he took part in different conspiracy activities and movements against the [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] tyranny with different military and political groups, until 1956 when he was caught when the conspiracy movement called "Los puros" was discovered. He was judged and sentenced to prison at [[Presidio Modelo]] on the [[Isla de Pinos]] (Isle of Pines), where he was until the Triumph of the [[Cuban Revolution]] on January 1, 1959.

==Cuban Revolution and beyond==
From 1959, as a member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, he took part in the different mobilizations, both productive as well as for the defense of the country. He also carried out other tasks of the Cuban Revolution both in Cuba and abroad.

At the time of the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] on 17 April 1961, he was director of militia training and based at Managua near Havana. He was sometimes referred to as '[[El Gallego]]' like his colleague Manuel Piñeiro. Before dawn that day, Fidel Castro ordered him to command the many battalions of militia and regular army troops engaged in fighting the invading forces of [[Brigade 2506]]. Late on 19 April 1961, he was among Cuban government forces that finally broke through to Playa Giron and forced surrender and dispersal of invading troops.&lt;ref&gt;Wyden (1979), p.249&lt;/ref&gt;

He was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (land)|Capitan]] in 1959, to [[Commandant]] in 1961 and to Brigade General of the reserve in 1966. He was graduated from the Higher War School in 1964. From 1959 he has been in charge of different responsibilities and positions, among which there are:

Director of the Cadet School of the Rebel Army; Chief of the Direction of Combat Preparation of the General Staff of FAR (initials for Revolutionary Armed Forces in Spanish) until 1968; Deputy Minister of FAR until 1970; First Deputy Minister of Education until 1972; Minister of Education from 1972 until 1990 and Vice-President of the Council of Ministers from 1978 to March 2012.

==Political life==
He represented the Cuban government at the investiture of presidents in several Latin American countries and at other governmental events. He is a member of the Executive Committee of the [[Pan American Sports Organization]].

José Ramón Fernández Álvarez took part in the five Congresses of the [[Cuban Communist Party]] and since 1975 has been a member of the Central Committee.

At the third congress of the Cuban Communist Party, he was elected as a Substitute Member of the Political Bureau. Fernandez has been a deputy to the [[National Assembly of People's Power|National Assembly]] since 1976 and was a Member of the Council of State from 1981 until 1993.

==Other points of interest==
He chaired the Organizing Committee of the XIV [[Central American and Caribbean Games]], held in [[Havana]] in 1982, and the Organizing Committee of the XI [[Pan American Games]] in Havana in 1991. He was also the chairman of the Organizing Committee of the VI [[Athletics World Cup]] that took place in Havana in 1992. Since 1997 he has been the President of the Cuban Olympic Committee.

He was the chairman of the Organizing Committee of the Scientific–Academic Conference "Giron, 40 years later", that took place in March 2001 and of the International Conference "The Missile Crisis, a political vision 40 years later" on October 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2411">'''Sir Kahedin''' (variantly spelled Kahadin, Kahedrin, Kehenis, Kehidius; possibly the [[Wales|Welsh]] character Kae Hir) is brother to [[Iseult#Iseult of Brittany|Iseult of Brittany]] and the son of King [[Hoel]] of Brittany in [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legend. The story of his affair with [[Brangaine]], the handmaiden of [[Iseult#Iseult of Ireland|Iseult of Ireland]] is significantly mentioned in the [[Tristan and Iseult]] legend.

Kahedin first meets Brangaine in the Hall of Images, where he was previously sent to deliver a message to Iseult of Ireland regarding the arrival of her lover, Sir [[Tristan]]. He conveys the message and Iseult and Tristan spend the night in a wooden cabin. Meanwhile, Kahedin prepares to spend the night with Brangaine after receiving favourable advances from her. When they go to bed, however, Kahedin plunges into a deep sleep and wakes up the following morning to realise that some sorcery must have been carried out. Out of courtesy, he ignores the happenings of the previous night and the two couples spend the day together. The same trick is carried out again that night; on the third night, Iseult manages to convince her maid to surrender to Kahedin to stop his humiliation. In some versions, Camille, another of the Queen's handmaidens, is chosen by Kahedin over Brangaine. She also refuses the knight, wishing to preserve her honour. Iseult then assists by providing Kahedin with a "magic pillow" after which he falls into a deep slumber. Kahedin wakes up the next morning to be taunted by Camille and the ladies of the household; he travels with Tristan without revealing to him the incident of the previous night.

In the ''[[Prose Tristan]]'', Kahedin remains Tristan's close companion even after his sister has been abandoned in Brittany. Like various other knights he falls in love with the Irish Iseult and eventually dies pining for her.

This is a list of [[familicide]]s that occurred in [[Europe]]. Being part of the [[list of rampage killers]], the latter's terms of inclusion are also applied here.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the table are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]]. &lt;!--Additions should be made 1) in order of # of fatalities, and 2) # injured--&gt;

'''Major Force''' ('''Clifford Zmeck''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]].

==Publication history==
Major Force first appeared in ''[[Captain Atom]]'' vol. 3, #12 (February 1988) and was created by [[Cary Bates]], [[Greg Weisman]], and [[Pat Broderick]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Major Force is a product of the same U.S. Federal project which created [[Captain Atom]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. The government, in a project headed by [[General Wade Eiling|Wade Eiling]] and the scientist Megala, was experimenting with the effects of [[atomic energy]] on an alien metal they had taken from a crashed spaceship to determine its full protective abilities; such as protecting a human being from a nuclear blast. After the disappearance of Nathaniel Adam and the perceived failure of the Captain Atom Project, the government restarted the project with a new subject, Clifford Zmeck and increased the amount of metal used (''[[Captain Atom]]'' #36 Dec. 89). While in the USAF, Zmeck had been jailed in a high security prison for [[rape]] and [[murder]] and sentenced to [[life in prison]]. He was offered a [[pardon]] in exchange for participation in the high-risk governmental experiment. The results were the same as with the Captain Atom Project and Zmeck disappeared into the Quantum Field, emerging one year after the return of Nathaniel Adam. This time, the government was ready and placed microimplants ranging from knockout gas to mini-explosives under the metal while it was still malleable, in order to control Zmeck in case he went rogue. During one mission, a government operator (who was actually the son of the woman Zmeck had murdered) activated one such charge, amputating Zmeck's left hand. Introduced as an ally, then successor to Captain Atom, Force's brutality betrayed his government-concocted role of superhero and brought him in frequent conflict with Atom. Major Force is now arguably Captain Atom's arch-enemy. Eventually, he became a hired gun for General Wade Eiling's or any other crooked government affiliated groups purposes.

===Crime and punishment===
In ''[[Green Lantern]]'' vol. 3, #54 (August 1994), Major Force killed [[Alexandra DeWitt|Alexandra "Alex" DeWitt]], girlfriend of the [[Green Lantern]] [[Kyle Rayner]], and stuffed her remains in a refrigerator where Kyle would find her on behalf of the [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#Q|Quorum Organization]] who wanted the GL ring that fell into Kyle's lap. Rayner tortured Major Force after their fight, but was stopped by forces of [[LAPD]]'s Special Crimes Unit. In an issue of ''Guy Gardner: Warrior'', Major Force seemingly slays Guy's mother in the same manner as Kyle's beloved girlfriend. After some confusion, it is learned Force had killed a neighbor who had been house-sitting. Having heard from Ryner about how Zmeck murdered his beloved, [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Gardner]] now awakened to his vuldarian heritage summarily executes him with a shifted edge.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Green Lantern]]'' vol. 3, #60 (March, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not the end of Zmeck however, as Quorum (the very people who employed him to harass Rayner and Gardner) had revived him and enhanced him with Vuldarian DNA. His return debut started with Force ''[[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]]: [[Guy Gardner (comics)#Guy Gardner: Warrior|Warrior]]'' #43 (June, 1996), killing [[Arisia (comics)|Arisia]], a former Green Lantern and dear friend of [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] as a declaration of war against him. Force was apparently confronted in [[New York City|New York]], [[United States of America]]; who After a brief skirmish between the two, seemingly murdering Guy in his weakened state. Only for the latter to revive himself before dealing Major Force a fatal blow causing the villain to implode. Seemingly killing him again in revenge.&lt;ref&gt;''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' vol. 1, #44 (July, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, Force is made of energy and not matter. He cannot die and has effectively gained immortality. As is made apparent in the comic of ''[[Resurrection Man (comics)|Resurrection Man]]'' Vol. 1, #21 (February, 1999) he somehow revived himself from previous injuries after a ripple in the quantum field of reality somehow revitalized him. Giving Force enough raw power to challenge the JLA directly with the assistance of a quantum powered Resurrection man, only to be disassembled into particles by the immortal loner yet to reform himself at a later date. Some time afterwards he gets into a skirmish with [[Superman]] over misinformation regarding his position in the government, gaining the upper hand using Dark Quantum Energy to sap Superman's Solar Energy. But Kal-El turns the tables on him by exploiting his lack of ability, namely by hyper heating his Dilustel body to the point of flash melting him in place like a smelted statue. He was taken into custody by [[Amanda Waller]] shortly afterwards, adamantly disclaiming any connection he might have to the U.S. Government when asked by the former.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' (Volume 2) #185 (October, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superman/Batman: Public Enemies===
In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #3 and #4 (December 2003 and January 2004), Force is part of a Government Task Force led by Captain Atom, in addition to Green Lantern [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], [[Power Girl]] of the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]], [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]] of the [[Teen Titans]], Outsiders and allies of Batman [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] and [[Black Lightning]]. He is saddled with Captain Atom by President [[Lex Luthor]] in order to bring in [[Superman]] when a [[Kryptonite]] asteroid was headed for Earth. Superman and [[Batman]] escape them in [[Washington, D.C.]], but met up with them again in [[Tokyo]]. Power Girl and Katana reveal they are double agents working with Superman and Batman the whole time. When Captain Atom and his squad pursue them to Japan, Power Girl strikes at the Major. When he returns fire, Katana chops his hands off, releasing the atomic energy he harbored. Batman convinces Captain Atom to absorb the energy leaking from Force, which threatened to decimate the city. Captain Atom absorbed all the energy and disappeared, moving several years into the future in a quantum leap.

As indicated in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #25, a copy of Major Force's mind, his thoughts, his anger, gets mixed in with the essence of the new [[Kryptonite Man]].

In ''[[Green Lantern]]'' vol. 3, #180 (October, 2004), Force apparently [[Decapitation|decapitates]] Maura Rayner, mother of Kyle Rayner, and stuffs her severed head in an oven. He later says it was just a mannequin. Kyle snaps, decapitates Force (whose head was still talking), seals it in a bubble of Green Lantern energy and sends it into outer space (Kyle later finds out his mother is alive and well).

==="One Year Later"===
{{Main|One Year Later}}
Major Force reappeared in the new ''Battle for [[Blüdhaven]]'' book, a title set a year after the events of [[Infinite Crisis]], as the field leader of project S.H.A.D.E. In issue #5, he rips the right arm off a government hero named [[Major Victory (DC Comics)|Major Victory]], and beats him to near death with it (Major Victory reappears in issue #7). He also picked a fight with [[Hal Jordan]], as Force vowed to kill any Green Lantern on sight after his last encounter with Kyle Rayner. Jordan personally wants to end Force's killing spree, enraged by Alexandra DeWitt and Arisia's murders, and even sent Force to a hard-light constructed refrigerator similar to what Force had done to DeWitt during the fight. However, Captain Atom was revived by the [[Atomic Knight]]s in issue #6 (as [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]]), and Force's rampage was quickly brought to an end when Atom drains him of his energy, leaving nothing but a husk. Force's deflated corpse was last seen falling to the ground during chaos left by Atom's energy expenditure resulting in a Nuclear Blast.

Major Force is later seen reconstituted and apart of a whole new regiment of S.H.A.D.E Super Soldiers manufactured at the behest of [[Gonzo the Mechanical Bastard]] out on the white house lawn.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'' #7 (March, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; A battle ensues between the false presidency's shadow cabinet and [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]] [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|&amp; his Freedom Fighters]] for the soul of America, wherein he is quickly dispatched by [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]] even after showcasing newfound super speed against her.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'' #8 (April, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; He was later seen being a part of The Secret Society during preparations for Oliver and Dinah's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America Wedding Special'' Vol 1 #1&lt;/ref&gt;

His image appears in the series ''Ion'' as a representation of Kyle Rayner's fear.

==="Blackest Night"===
Major Force's body is seen being kept in a secured crypt beneath Justice League of America's Hall of Justice in Washington, DC during ''[[Blackest Night]]'' #1.

However, he is subsequently seen alive and well among a band of villains that includes [[Eclipso]] and [[Dr. Polaris]] in during ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' #29.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #37 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; He is also seen in the pages of ''[[Action Comics]]'' #882, as part of the government project 7734, attempting to capture the rogue [[Captain Atom]], who had since returned to his former identity.

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Major Force has his first major appearance in ''[[The Fury of Firestorm]]: The Nuclear Man'' #20 (July 2013). He is introduced as a government agent working under [[General Wade Eiling]], with a special rank that allows him to represent all branches of the United States Military. His primary goal is to protect, and later escort, Firestorm from the threat of various rogues and to convince him to work for the government. Major Force had previously appeared in silhouette before his full appearance.

Major Force's design is the same as that of Black Jack, also referred to as Major Bolton, a character who had appeared earlier in The New 52. Black Jack is an agent of the Black Razors, who had first appeared in ''[[Voodoo (comics)|Voodoo]]'' #2 (Dec. 2011). In ''Voodoo'' #5 (March 2012) and ''Voodoo'' #7 (May 2012), it is revealed that he was given powers by the Black Razors, due to recommendation of his superior, Commander Andrew Lincoln of the [[Blackhawks (DC Comics)|Blackhawks]]. Black Jack was decapitated by Voodoo in ''Voodoo'' #7 (May 2012).

Black Jack/Force was seen alive again some time later when ordered by General Eiling to bring in Firestorm, under the pretense that the rogue meta was a threat to national security.&lt;ref&gt;''Legends of Tomorrow'' Vol 1 #2 (June, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Eager for a chance at a rematch with the nuclear powered superhero Force eagerly accepted the mission, attacking him in the center of a populated area in [[Portland, Oregon]]. He's eventually bested when the conflicting personas of Raymond and Stein gain new trust in one another.

Pooling their resource as Firestorm together to take the special agent down. This was however a clever ruse on the Major's part, as he simply acted as a distraction for Wade's secondary strike team to come up from behind and cage the conjoined entity in a magentokinetic plasma field.&lt;ref&gt;''Legends of Tomorrow'' Vol 1 #3 (July, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Upon return to base however, Major Force proved he held more of a moral compass compared to his superior. Disgusted with the torment the good general was subjugated their quarry too. When the containment field threatened to cause Firestorm to go nuclear however he immediately jumped into the fray, smashing the containment field apart, enabling the prisoner to escape. Irked by General Eiling's Reckless misconduct, he relived him of duty while threatening to report him to the higher authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''Legends of Tomorrow'' Vol 1 #4 (Aug, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Jurgens, writer of ''The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Man'', says Major Force had been introduced into The New 52 earlier, suggesting that he and Black Jack are the same character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burlingame|first=Russ|title=Firestorm’s Finale, Major Force and the Fridge: Jurgens On #20|url=http://comicbook.com/blog/2013/05/22/firestorms-finale-major-force-and-the-fridge-jurgens-on-20/|publisher=ComicBook.com|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
===Powers===
Major Force is coated with the same [[Captain Atom#Dilustel|Dilustel]] alien alloy that covers [[Captain Atom]].&lt;ref&gt;Captain Atom vol. 3, #12 (February 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he also can access the Quantum Field and use its energies for a variety of powers. Unlike Atom however, his abilities stemmed from a different spectrum of the field granting him different powers from Nathaniel, aside from the augmented physicality also lacking the capability to switch between human and energy being forms at will. This was theorized to be a result of the Major Force Project using double the amount of alien alloy and detonating a bomb with a different blast yield.

When he debuted, Major Force seemed to control matter much in the way Captain Atom controls energy. Therefore, he could project high velocity blasts of dark matter from his hands. He could manipulate this matter into various shapes and quantities. Using this ability to create a hand to replace the one that was blown off by implanted explosives underneath his skin. He initially lacked the ability to fly, but rather leapt great distances or traveled on ramps made of dark matter. A seldom used facet of his Dark Matter powers was the capacity to convert whatever force he comes in contact with, be it matter or energy, into solid Dark Matter. A trait that was embellished upon in Batman: The Brave and the Bold cartoon series.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Captain Atom]]'' Annual, #1 (January 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; He seemed to show some minor Self-Matter Manipulation abilities as well thanks to an upgrade to his powers using some of Guy Gardner's alien DNA, being able to shape the metal of his Dilustel into various weapons, often using this in conjunction with his Dark Matter control.&lt;ref&gt;''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' Vol. 1, #43 (June 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually Major Force learned how to tap the Q-Field in order to fly both before and after his first revival from when the Vuldarian Guy Gardner fatally wounded him. Showing off a whole host of aerial maneuvers while battling Captain Atom and the likes of one of the Justice Leagues various incarnations. All of this in tandem with his metamorphic powers acquired from his gene splicing make Major Force all the more formidable an opponent to face. Matter &amp; Energy powers aside, Major Force is a physical powerhouse comparable to some of the strongest of DC's metahumans. Force's Dilustel skin is linked to the Quantum Field, which enables him to absorb and manipulate virtually limitless amounts of matter to dynamically empower himself in the similar way Captain Atom can absorb limitless energy (but Clifford lacks imagination in the use of his abilities and is as dumb as he is psychotic).

This factor of his powers enables him superior strength (able to knock around Superman over several hundred miles from Metropolis to Ohio and trade blows with the equally powerful Captain Atom), invulnerability (He's withstood all manner of energy attacks ranging from Green Lantern and Vuldarian energy blasts, resist small to large explosive force and even weathered Captain Atom's quantum blasts more than once) Also due to his unique physiology Major Force lacks the need for physical sustenance thanks to the Dilustel's connection to the Q-Field (he can survive indefinitely without need to eat, sleep, breath or rest while in action; this enables him to thrive and speak freely in the vacuum of space), Due to his nature as pure material energy, Major Force is functionally Immortal in a similar vein to Mitchell Shelley; the Resurrection Man. For while the villain can be seemingly killed, he will always revive and return to life more powerful than ever. Even learning to access new uses to his powers, ergo every-time he's critically wounded or suffers fatal inquiry he will regenerate or resurrect stronger than before.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Resurrection Man (comics)|Resurrection Man]]'' Vol. 1, #21 (February, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Both through this factor of his powers and over time with his many experiences, Zmeck became all the more familiar with using his quantum based abilities, eventually discovering he could pull off many new tricks similar to Captain Atom. Such usage of his powers as a result of better understanding them throughout his career as a supervillain include; discharging quantum blasts, throwing up protective force fields bubbles, utilize his Q-Energy for simulated TK to lift and move around objects, simulate a form of Quantum Speed akin to Resurrection Man, being able to detonate like a nuke with sufficient concentration and emit quantum blasts from any point on his body such as his hands &amp; eyes, though he preferably focuses this through his hands as it is easier to control that way. Even being able to emit a type of dark quantum energy that can forcefully siphon energy away from other superpowered beings, such as Kryptonians, but his skill in energy absorption is lacking compared to Adam as other's have taken advantage of things the latter can handle which he cannot.

In later appearances Force, much like his counterpart Captain Atom; had a radiological element introduced into his being. Threatening a dangerous if not outright lethal nuclear fallout in the event his Dilustel shell was ever ruptured, resulting in an atomic blast capable of leveling cities. Despite this Force also boasts potent regenerative capabilities, potent enough to restore himself from total molecular dispersal if need be.

On top of all his abilities Clifford Zmeck is a military trained [[United States Air Force]] operative. An armed forces [[Sergeant]] and combat specialist, eventually bumped up to Army [[Major]] after he was reinstated by General Wade Eiling upon his successful Quantum jump into the future. Despite his loutish appearance like behavior Major Force is a seasoned war veteran with apparent skill in Black Ops, Infantry, Spy Work as well as CQC (Closed Quarters Combat). On top of this he has vast military connections within his government being their greatest weapon; having ties with Checkmate, Task Force X, Quorum's security detail.

===Dilustel===
Major Force's metallic skin, the shell which gives him his powers dubbed Dilustel. Comprises an alien being; The Silver Shield's, own physiological substance. This transorganic metal was taken from said extra-dimensional entity's own body and used in [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#Project Atom|The Atom Project]]; which would go on to birth Individuals similar to him [[Captain Atom]] being the first successful subject and [[Bombshell (DC Comics)|Bombshell]] being the latest subject of which. Unlike Nathaniel who is able to coat himself with the metal at will, Force is unable to either partially or totally remove his Dilustel from his body, it's theorized that this was due to using double the amount of which with a greater yield of nuke during his conception. Dilustel is virtually indestructible, able to withstand all manner of punishment from a great many sources to a certain degree, such as concussive force, energy beams, blunt trauma, etc. One of the few things that can damage it are '''X-Ionizer''' technologies which harden's material effected by it via atomic/molecular lattice knitting, making a knife sharp enough to pierce it or a bullet dense enough to perforate it; being the only means of extracting if from Silver Shield. The [[katana (comics)|Katana's]] Soultaker Sword is one of the few things that can rend Major Force's nigh-invulnerable hide.&lt;ref&gt;''SUperman/Batman'' Vol. 1, #4 (Jan 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Cracking or rupturing his dermal layer causes Major Force to leak Radiation at an uncontrollable rate, to which he runs the risk of Atomic Detonation.

===New 52/DC Rebirth===
Zmeck's Powers in the company wide reboot remain largely the same but at lower levels than before. He still boasts the same incredibly high levels of physical dexterity as he did in previous continuity. Retaining his incredibly high levels of strength, durability and stamina enabling him to survive falling from tremendous heights leaving craters where he lands.&lt;ref&gt;''Voodoo'' #2 (Dec. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of his typical quantum &amp; dark matter based superpowers he now emits a form of Dark Energy he can discharge from his hands at will, this force can strike with incredible heft carried behind it as he can easily decimate vehicular automotive's with ease.&lt;ref&gt;''Voodoo'' #6 (Aprl. 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Because he lacks the ability to fly by his own power, he incorporates his leg muscles to carry himself over great distances instead.&lt;ref&gt;''Legends of Tomorrow'' Vol 1 #3 (July, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Major Force is physically powerful enough to challenge the physically amalgamated Firestorm with relative ease, actually overwhelming him in combat more than once. He's also able to resist incredible amounts of blunt trauma done onto his physical frame, able to resist sharp changes in temperature be it from Killer Frost's ice blasts or Ronnie's nuclear blasts without sustaining physical injury.&lt;ref&gt;''The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Man'' Vol 2 #20 (July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; He can also take high end laser fire with ease and remain relatively unharmed showing little to zero discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;''Voodoo'' #7-8 vol. 2 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

His abilities were given to him by the joint efforts of the Internal Operations Black Razor's and Black Hawk Organization's, under what procedure he was given his enhancements remains a mystery. There are limits to his augmentations, for in spite of his resilience and dynamism he can still be bled, injured or killed by sufficiently powerful force. Having been physically bested by the likes of Superman on their first meeting,&lt;ref&gt;''The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Man'' Vol 2 #20 (July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; being decapitated by the rogue clone of the Daemonite hybrid Ms. Kitaen and sustained some minor burns in preventing Firestorm from going thermonuclear.&lt;ref&gt;''Legends of Tomorrow'' Vol 1 #4 (Aug, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

He may also retain his resurrection abilities from his previous existence as well. Seeing as he was killed by the Evil Voodoo yet turned up alive again a couple of years later after said turn of events.

==Other versions==
===Anti-Matter Universe===
Major Force had a counterpart on the antimatter universe's Earth named Q-Ranger, a member of the [[Justice Underground]].&lt;ref&gt;''JLA Secret Files 2004'' 1 (Nov, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
* Major Force appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Powerless!" voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. Retaining many of his powers in publishing as well as his missing appendage, Major Force boasts an augmented use of ability to convert matter in inanimate dark matter using his stump of a hand. While attacking a military base at the Pentagon he ends up stealing the Quantum Vacuum; a device fueled by leeching off any feasible source of nuclear energy and uses it to steal Captain Atom's powers regressing him back to Nathaniel Adams. Then he drains the energy of a nuclear plant before engaging the other Justice League International members. Martian Manhunter states to Nathaniel Adams and Aquaman that Major Force defeated the Justice League International members that fought him before he turned his sights upon the white house. When Batman, Aquaman, and Martian Manhunter try to fight him, Major Force manages to knock them down causing Nathaniel Adams to take action and crashes a jet into him. When Major Force grabs Nathaniel Adams, the Quantum Vacuum overloads which ends up releasing the stolen powers. Upon regaining his powers, Captain Atom soundly defeats Major Force.

===Film===
* Major Force appears in the animated film ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'' voiced by [[Ricardo Chavira]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=502 The World's Finest]&lt;/ref&gt; His role in the film is very similar to that of the comic with the difference that he personally kills [[Metallo]] in order to [[frame (crime)|frame]] Superman. It is hinted that he knew firsthand about Lex Luthor's plans for world domination and deliberately kept it a secret in exchange for Luthor allowing him to kill Metallo (something Batman makes note of). In the end, he is killed when Power Girl accidentally punctures his suit and Captain Atom succeeds in absorbing all the radiation that leaked out, which otherwise would have destroyed Metropolis. In the movie, he shares Captain Atom's power of flight.

===Video games===
* Major Force appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' voiced by [[Alexander Brandon]]. Major Force is one of the bosses the players encounter in the [[Bludhaven]] Alert. He is apparently working with [[Amanda Waller]] to gather some samples from [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] (who is the final boss of the encounter) in order to test the Chemoids. Nightwing appears stating that Bludhaven is his town and has Major Force tell Amanda Waller that she has crossed the line. After Major Force attacks Nightwing, the players end up fighting Major Force and defeating him. Martian Manhunter states that Major Force working with Amanda Waller will require investigation and sends the players to defeat Chemo.

'''Michael "Mike" Soles''' (born November 8, 1966) is a former all-star Canadian university and [[Canadian Football League]] fullback.

==Early life==
Soles played his high school football with the hometown [[St. Thomas High School (Quebec)|St. Thomas High School]]&lt;ref&gt;The Montreal Gazette - Nov 14, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and played his university ball in Montreal with [[McGill University]] (1986–89). As a Redman he was a 3 time all-star and rushed for a then team record 2,231&amp;nbsp;yards in 20 regular season games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/athletics/varsitysports/athletes/profiles/view/?id=810 McGill University Sports Hall of Fame: Michael Soles]&lt;/ref&gt; His finest moment came in the 1987 [[Vanier Cup]], when he led the underdog McGill team to an upset 47-11 victory over the heavily favoured [[University of British Columbia]], rushing for 203&amp;nbsp;yards and 2 touchdowns. He won the Ted Morris Memorial Trophy as the game MVP. He was elected to the McGill University Sports Hall of Fame in 2000.

==Professional career==
Soles was drafted by the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] and started a seven-year career with them in 1989. His best season was 1992, when he rushed for a career-high 656&amp;nbsp;yards. He won the [[Grey Cup]] in 1993.

He finished his career in his hometown, playing 4 final seasons with the [[Montreal Alouettes]]. Paired with the all-time CFL rushing great [[Mike Pringle (gridiron football)|Mike Pringle]], Soles became a blocking back, leading the way for Pringle and catching many short yardage passes (for which he was an all-star in 1996.) He won the [[Lew Hayman Trophy]] in 1996 as best Canadian player in the East. When he retired, Pringle paid him a supreme compliment, saying he would have never gained the yards he did without Soles' blocking.

Soles finished his 11-year career with 3,007 rushing yards, 3,501 receiving yards (on 325 catches) and 45 touchdowns.

==Personal life==
Soles and his family still live in the [[West Island]] of Montreal, in [[Beaconsfield, Quebec|Beaconsfield]]. He works in finance.&lt;ref name="Soles"/&gt;

In 2005, he was diagnosed as suffering from [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="Soles"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/sports/football/montreal-alouettes/Former+Alouette+Michael+Soles/7910323/story.html|title=Former Alouette Michael Soles "hopeful" in ALS battle|last=Soles|first=Michael|date=2 February 2013|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}} 	
The '''Nipmuc''' or '''Nipmuck''' people are descendants of the indigenous [[Algonquian peoples]] of ''Nippenet'', 'the freshwater pond place', which corresponds to central [[Massachusetts]] and immediately adjacent portions of [[Connecticut]] and [[Rhode Island]].  The tribe were first encountered by Europeans in 1630, when John Acquittamaug arrived with maize to sell to the starving colonists of [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Larnad, E. D. (1874). history of windham county, connecticut: 1600-1760. (Vol. I, p. 59). Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonists introduced pathogens, such as [[smallpox]], to which the Native Americans had no prior exposure. They were also exposed to alcohol for the first time, which led to huge numbers of natives succumbing to the effects of alcoholism. With the passage of increasingly harsh laws against Indian culture and religion, the loss of land, legally and illegally, to growing English colonies, many of the Nipmuc joined [[Metacomet|Metacomet's]] rebellion in 1675, the results of which were disastrous.  Many of the Nipmuc were interned on Deer Island in Boston Harbor and perished, and others were executed or sold into slavery in the [[West Indies]].

The Reverend [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] arrived in Boston in 1631 and began an ambitious project to learn the [[Massachusett language]], widely understood throughout [[New England]], convert the Native Americans, and published a Bible and grammar of the language.  His efforts, with colonial government backing, established several 'Indian plantations' or '[[Praying towns]]'—predecessors to the [[Indian Reservation]]—where the Native Americans were coerced to settle and instructed in English customs, Christianity, but governed and preached to by other Native Americans and in their own dialects. By the 19th century, the Nipmuc were reduced to wards of the state that were administered by state-appointed commissioners.  The passage of the Massachusetts Enfranchisement Act of 1869 effectively 'detribalised' the Nipmuc, and the last of the remaining Indian plantation lands were sold.  Nipmuc communities continued to survive, and the tribe received state recognition in 1979,  but efforts at federal recognition have not met with success.

==Ethnonyms==
The tribe is first mentioned in a 1631 letter by Deputy Governor [[Thomas Dudley]] as the ''Nipnet'', 'people of the freshwater pond' due the inland location.  This derives from ''Nippenet'' and includes variants such as ''Neipnett'', ''Neepnet'', ''Nepmet'', ''Nibenet'', ''Nopnat'' and ''Nipneet''.  In 1637, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] records the tribe as the ''Neepmuck'', which derives from ''Nipamaug'', 'people of the freshwater fishing place,' and also appears as  ''Neetmock'', ''Notmook'', ''Nippimook'', ''Nipmaug'', ''Nipmoog,'' ''Neepemut'', ''Nepmet'', ''Nepmock,'' ''Neepmuk'' as well as modern ''Nipmuc(k)''.  Colonists and the Native Americans themselves used this term extensively after the growth of the [[Praying towns]].&lt;ref&gt;Connole, D. A. (2007). ''Indians of the nipmuck country in southern new england 1630-1750, an historical geography.'' Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Co. pp. 7 - 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, R. W. (2006). ''Handbook of american indians, north of mexico''. (Vol. II). Whitefish, MT: Kessinger Pub. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;  The French referred to most New England Native Americans as ''Loup'', 'the Wolf People,' but the name ''ȣmiskanȣakȣiak'', the 'beaver tail-hill people,' was recorded as self-appellation of Nipmuc refugees that had fled to [[Canada (New France)|French Colonial Canada]] amongst the [[Abenaki]].&lt;ref&gt;Day, G. M., Foster, M. K., &amp; Cowan, W. (1998). In search of new england's native past: Selected essays. (p. 181). Amherst, MA: [[University of Massachusetts Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions or bands==
[[File:Tribal Territories Southern New England.png|thumb|right|300px|General location of the Nipmuc(k) and other tribes.]] 
[[Daniel Gookin]], Superintendent to the Native Americans and assistant of Eliot, was careful to distinguish the Nipmuc (proper), Wabquasset, Quaboag and Nashaway tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Connole, D. A. (2007). ''Indians of the nipmuck country in southern new england 1630-1750, an historical geography.'' Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Co. pp. 8 - 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  The situation was fluid since Native Americans unhappy with their chiefs were free to join other groups, and shifting alliances were made based on kinship, military, and tributary relationships with other tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Connole, D. A. (2007). pp. 8 - 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated74"&gt;Hodge, F. W. (1910). Nipmuc. Handbook of american indians north of mexico.. (Vol. III, p. 74). Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution.&lt;/ref&gt;  The formation of the Praying towns broke tribal divisions as the Native Americans were settled together, but four groups that are associated with the Nipmuc peoples survive today:

'''Chaubunagungamaug Nipmuck''' or '''Dudley Indians'''
* Descendants of the Praying town of Chaunbunagungamaug which is now located in the town of [[Webster, Massachusetts|Webster]] on lands ceded by the town of [[Dudley, Massachusetts]].
* The tribe uses several acres held in [[Webster, Massachusetts]] and across the border in [[Thompson, Connecticut]].

'''Hassanamisco Nipmuc''' or '''Grafton Indians'''
* Descendants of the Praying town of Hassanamessit which is now located in [[Grafton, Massachusetts]].
* The Cisco (Scisco, Ciscoe) family maintained their four acres from the final Hassamessit land sales and this is the current reservation.

'''Natick Massachusett''' or '''Natick Nipmuc'''
* The descendants of the Praying town of [[Natick, Massachusetts]] do not retain any of their original lands.
* The Natick are primarily descended from the [[Massachusett]] as well as Nipmuc ancestry, and qualify for state services as Nipmuc.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development, Commission on Indian Affairs. (n.d.). Tuition waiver guidelines. Retrieved from Commonwealth of Massachusetts website: www.mass.gov/hed/docs/dhcd/ia/tuitionwaiver.doc.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Connecticut Nipmuc'''
* Descendants of various Nipmuc that survived or re-located to [[Connecticut]].
* The Nipmuc of Connecticut, unlike in Massachusetts, are not recognized by their state.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, R. Connecticut Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General, Indian Affairs.

Retrieved from http://www.ct.gov/ag/lib/ag/press_releases/2002/indian/nipmuc_brief.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==

===State recognition===
Governor [[Michael Dukakis]] issued Executive Order #126 which proclaimed that 'State agencies shall deal directly with ... [the] Nipmuc ... on matters affecting the Nipmuc Tribe' as well as calling for the creation of a state 'Commission on Indian Affairs.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/courts/docs/lawlib/eo100-199/eo126.txt Mass. Executive Order #126.] Dukakis 65th Governorship, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent establishment of the all-Indian Commission conferred state support for education, health care, cultural continuity, and protection of remaining lands for the descendants of the Wampanoag, Nipmuc and Massachusett tribes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts General Laws, pt. I, Title II, Chapter 6A, § 8A.&lt;/ref&gt;  The state also calls for the examination of all human remains and to notify the Commission, who after the investigation of the State Archaeologist, decide the appropriate course of action.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts General Laws, pt. I, Title II, Chapter 7, § 38A.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts also cited the continuity of the Nipmuc(k) with the historic tribe and commended tribal efforts to preserve their culture and traditions. The state also symbolically repealed the General Court Act of 1675 that banned Native Americans from the City of Boston during [[King Philip's War]].&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Session Laws. 181st General Court, 2005, Chapter 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The tribe also works closely with the state to undergo various archaeological excavations and preservation campaigns.  The tribe, in conjunction with the [[National Congress of American Indians]] were against the construction of the sewage treatment plant on [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]] in Boston Harbor where many graves were desecrated by its construction, and annually hold a remembrance service for members of the tribe lost over the winter during their internment during [[King Philip's War]] and protest against the destruction of Indian gravesites.&lt;ref&gt;Nipmuc Nation. (1994). Remembering deer island: A cause worth of nipmuc support. Nipmucspohke, I(2), 2-3. Retrieved from nipmucspohke.homestead.com/Vol.I_Is.2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal recognition efforts===
[[File:John Olver and a Nipmuc woman.jpg|thumb|right|Congressman John Olver meets with a Nipmuc woman during the tribe's bid for federal recognition.]] On 22 April 1980, [[Zara Cisco Brough]], landowner of Hassanamessit, submitted a letter of intention to petition for [[Federally recognized tribes|federal recognition]] as a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe which would confer certain rights, including state-to-state relations with the [[United States Congress]] and other support and services from the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA).  The Nipmuc, represented by just the Hassanamisco, were added to the [[Federal Register]] as Petitioner #69.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, R. Connecticut Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General, Indian Affairs. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the Chaubunagungamaug joined the efforts.  On 20 July 1984, the BIA received the petition letter from the 'Nipmuc Tribal Council Federal Recognition Committee' co-signed by Zara Cisco Brough and her successor, Walter A. Vickers, of the Hassanamisco and Edwin 'Wise Owl' W. Morse, Sr. of the Chaubunagungamaug.  On 2 February 1995, the Branch of Acknowledgement and Research (BAR) of the BIA to Edwin W. Morse, Sr. declared Petitioner #69 ready for active consideration, and requested the tribal membership lists in follow-up letter later that May.  By 11 July 1995, the Nipmuc were placed on 'active consideration.'&lt;ref&gt;Martin, A. U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs. (2004).

==Pre-contact history==
[[Paleo-Indians|Palaeo-Indians]] entered the region from the south-west during the retreat of the [[Wisconsin Glacier]] sometime around 9000 BC.  Evidence includes various [[chert]] tools that have been uncovered at the Bull Run site in [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]] as well as various riverside excavation sites in central portions of the state.  These early peoples hunted the tundra environment, probably in search of [[caribou]] and other game.&lt;ref&gt;Dincauze, D. F.  U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service.  (2007).

Climate Change Institute, University of Maine, Orono, ME.  Retrieved from http://climatechange.umaine.edu/Research/Contrib/html/11.html&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a great shift to more permanent hunting camps and expansion of tool making abilities.  Fishing equipment, more advanced stone tools, burial culture, localised hunting, and development of stone bowls developed during the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic Period]] which began around 7000 BC.  During this period, warmer weather would see forests develop and the extinction of the ice age [[megafauna]].  Settlements became more permanent and population densities increased.&lt;ref&gt;Mulholland, M. T., &amp; Currin, K. (1997). Prehistory in new england. Biology Department, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA. Retrieved from http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/conn.river/prehis.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Woodland Period]] began with the local development of agriculture sometime around 1000 BC and would last until contact occurred in the 17th century&lt;ref&gt;Mulholland, M. T., &amp; Currin, K.  (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  Peoples during this period had adopted [[Eastern Agricultural Complex|agriculture]] as well as [[slash-and-burn]] practices.  This period would also see the adoption of ceramic pottery, introduction of the [[atlatl]], and a culture that would have been recognisable to the later colonists.  Populations increased and settlements became more permanent with the advent of agriculture.  During the later stages of the period, pottery styles became influenced by [[Iroquois]] pottery styles and the [[bow and arrow]] were also adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Murphree, D. S. (2012).

==Colonial-era history==

===17th century===
[[File:Baskets - Danforth Museum - Framingham, MA - DSC00266.JPG|thumb|right|Examples of Indian baskets at the Danforth Museum in [[Framingham, Massachusetts]].]][[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[English people|English]] sailors and adventurers began visiting [[New England]], although the first permanent settlements in the region began after the settling of [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620.  These early seafarers introduced several diseases to which the Native Americans had no prior contact, resulting in [[epidemics]] with mortality rates as high as 90%.  [[Smallpox]] wiped out many of the Native Americans from 1617–1619, 1633, 1648–1649 and 1666.  [[Influenza]], [[typhus]], and [[measles]] also afflicted the Native Americans throughout the period.  The colonists, such as the writings of [[Increase Mather]], attributed the decimation of the Native Americans to God's providence in clearing the new lands for settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, G. C.  (2010).  ''Encyclopedia of plague and pestilence''.  (pp. 255-256).  New York, NY: Infobase Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nipmuc at the time of contact were a fairly large grouping, subject to their more powerful neighbours who provided protection, especially against the [[Pequot]], [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] and [[Abenaki]] tribes that raided the area.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Sultzman, L. (2008, October 29). Nipmuc history. Retrieved from http://www.dickshovel.com/nipmuc.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  The colonists depended initially on the Native Americans for survival in the [[New World]], and the Native Americans rapidly began to trade their foodstuffs, furs and [[wampum]] for the copper kettles, arms and metal tools of the colonists.  [[Puritan]] settlers arrived in large numbers from 1620–1640, the '[[Puritan migration to New England (1620–1640)|Great Migration]]' which increased pressure to procure more land.  Since the colonists had conflicting colonial and royal grants, the settlers quickly depended on Indian names on land deeds to mark legitimacy.  This backfired, as John Wampas deeded off many lands to the colonists to curry favour, many of which were not even his.&lt;ref&gt;Mandell, D. R.

The experiment also began for the settlement of the Native Americans on the 'Indian plantations' or '[[Praying towns]]'.  The Native Americans were instructed in English farming methods, culture, language but administered by Indian preachers and councillors often descended from the chiefly families.  The Native Americans melded Indian culture and English ways, but were mistrusted by both the colonists and their non-converted brethren.  The remnants of the plantations were sold off, and by the end of the 19th century, only the Cisco homestead in Grafton remained in possession of direct descendants of Nipmuc landholders.

====King Philip's War====
[[File:Brookfield1.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of the siege of [[Brookfield, Massachusetts]] during [[King Philip's War]].]]The [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] passed numerous legislation against Indian culture and religion.  New laws were passed to limit the influence of the [[powwows]], or 'shamans', and restricted the ability of non-converted Native Americans to enter English towns on [[Christian Sabbath|Sabbath]].&lt;ref&gt;Book of the General Lavves and Libertyes. Indians, §9 Retrieved from https://archive.org/details/coloniallawsofma00mass&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nipmuc were also informed that any unimproved lands were fair game for incorporation into the growing colony.  These draconian measures and the increasing amount of land lost to the settlers led many Nipmuc to join the [[Wampanoag]] chief [[Metacomet]] in a rebellion against the English which would ravage [[New England]] from 1675-1676.  The Native Americans that had already settled the [[Praying towns]] were interned on [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]] in Boston Harbor over the winter where a great many perished from starvation and exposure to the elements.  Although many of the Native Americans fled to join the uprising, other Native Americans joined the English.  The Praying Indians were particularly at risk, as the war made all Native Americans suspect, but the Praying towns were also attacked by the 'wild' Native Americans that joined the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, J. D.  (1999). ''King philip's war: Civil war in new england, 1675-1676''.  (pp. 101-105).  Amherst, MA: [[University of Massachusetts Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nipmuc were major participants in the siege of [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]], [[Brookfield, Massachusetts|Brookfield]], [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]] and Bloody Brook, all in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Mandell, D. R. (2010). King philip's war: Colonial expansion, native resistance, and the end of indian sovereignty. (pp. 60-75). Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkinds University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The siege of Lancaster also lead to the capture of [[Mary Rowlandson]], who was placed in captivity until ransomed for £20 and would later write a memoir of her captivity.&lt;ref&gt;Waldrup, C. C.  (1999).   ''Colonial Women: 23 Europeans Who Helped Build a Nation.''  Jefferson, NC: McFarland Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Native Americans lost the war, and survivors were hunted down, murdered, sold into slavery in the [[West Indies]] or forced to leave the area.&lt;ref&gt;Calloway, C. G. C.  (1997).  ''After king philip's war, presence and persistence in indian new england''.  (p. 2).  Dartmouth, NH: Dartmouth College.&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
The Nipmuc regrouped around their former [[Praying towns]] and were able to maintain a certain amount of autonomy using the remaining lands to farm or sell timber.  The population of the tribe was reduced as several outbreaks of [[smallpox]] returned in 1702, 1721, 1730, 1752, 1764, 1776 and 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Historical Society (1823). Collections of the massachusetts historical society. Chronological Table, X(II), 218. New York, NY: Johnson Reprint Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; Land sales continued unabated, much of it used to pay for legal fees, personal expenses, and improvements to the reserve lands.  By 1727, Hassanamisset was reduced to 500 acres from the original 7,500 acres with that land incorporated into the town of [[Grafton, Massachusetts]], and in 1797, Chaubunagungamaug Reserve was reduced to 26 of their 200 acres.&lt;ref&gt;Mandell, D. R. (2011). Tribe, race, history: Native americans in southern new england, 1780–1880. (pp. 20-21). Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The switch to the cattle industry also disrupted the native economy, as the colonists' cattle ate the unfenced lands of the Nipmuc and the courts did not always side with the Native Americans, but the Native Americans rapidly adopted the husbandry of [[swine]] since the changes in economy and loss of remaining pristine lands reduced ability to hunt and fish.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. M.  (1997).  ''Dispossession by Degrees: Indian Land and Identity in Natick, Massachusetts, 1650-1790''.  (pp. 6, 45).  Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the Native Americans had few assets besides land, much of the land was sold to pay for medical, legal and personal expenses, increasing the number of landless Native Americans.  With smaller numbers and landholdings, Indian autonomy was worn away by the time of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], the remaining reserve lands were overseen by colony- and later state-appointed guardians that were to act on the Native Americans' behalf.  However, the Hassanamisco guardian Stephen Maynard, appointed in 1776, embezzled the funds and was never prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;Mandell, D. R.  ''Behind the frontier:
Native Americans in eighteenth-century eastern massachusetts''.  (p. 151).  Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wars====
New England rapidly became swept up in a series of wars between the French and English and their respective Indian allies.  Many of the Native Americans of the New England had escaped to join the [[Abenaki]] and returned to fight against the English, however the local Native Americans were often conscripted as guides or scouts for the colonists.  Wars occupied much of the century, including [[King William's War]], (1689–1699), [[Queen Anne's War]] (1704–1713), [[Dummer's War]] (1722–1724), [[King George's War]] (1744–1748) and the [[French and Indian War]] (1754–1760).  Many Native Americans also died in service of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref&gt;Calloway, C. G. C.  (1997).  ''After king philip's war, presence and persistence in indian new england''.  (p. 7).  Dartmouth, NH: Dartmouth College.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mandell, D. (2011).  ''King philip's war, colonial expansion, native resistance, and the end of indian sovereignty''. (pp. 136-138).  Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins Univ Pr.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emigration====
The upheaval of the Indian Wars and growing mistrust of the Native Americans by the colonists lead to a steady trickle, and sometimes whole villages, that fled to increasingly mixed-tribe bands either northward to the [[Pennacook]] and [[Abenaki]] who were under the protection of the [[France|French]] or westward to join the [[Mahican]] at increasingly mixed settlements of [[Schaghticoke tribe|Schagticoke]] or [[Stockbridge-Munsee|Stockbridge]], the latter of which eventually migrated as far west as [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;Calloway, C. G. C.  (1997).  ''After king philip's war, presence and persistence in indian new england''.  (pp. 40-45).  Dartmouth, NH: Dartmouth College.&lt;/ref&gt;  This further dwindled Indian presence in [[New England]], although not all the Native Americans dispersed.  Those Nipmuc that fled eventually assimilated into either the predominate host tribe or the conglomerate that developed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated74"/&gt;

==Post-colonial history==

===19th century===
[[File:Hepsibeth Hemenway.jpg|thumb|right|155 px|Late 1830s portrait of Hepsibeth Hemenway, a Nipmuc woman who became very well known as a popular cake baker in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].]]The Native Americans were reduced to wards of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and continued to be represented by state-appointed guardians.  Rapid acculturation and intermarriage led many to believe the Nipmuc had simply just vanished, due to a combination of romantic notions of who the Native Americans were and to justify the colonial expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Calloway, C. G. C.  (1997).  ''After king philip's war, presence and persistence in indian new england''.  (pp. 211-221).  Dartmouth, NH: Dartmouth College.&lt;/ref&gt;  Native Americans continued to exist but fewer and fewer were able to live on the dwindling reserve lands and most left to seek employment as domestics or servants in White households, out to sea as whalers or seafarers, or into the growing cities where they became labourers or barbers.&lt;ref&gt;Mandell, D. R.  'The Saga of Sarah Muckamugg: indian and African Intermarriage in Colonial New England.' ''Sex, love, race: crossing boundaries in north american history''.  ed.  Martha Elizabeth Hodes. (pp. 72-83).  New York, NY: New York Univ Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Growing acculturation, intermarriage, and dwindling populations led to the extinction of the Natick Dialect of the [[Massachusett language]], and only one speaker could be found in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, I. &amp; Bragdon, K.  (1998).  ''Native writings in massachusett''.  (p. 20).  Philadelphia, PA: American Philosophical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the traditional things that survived was the peddling of native square-edged splint baskets and medicines.&lt;ref&gt;Prindle, T.  (1994).  'Nipmuc Splint Basketry.'  Retrieved from http://www.nativetech.org/weave/nipmucbask/.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, after investigating the condition of the Native Americans, decided to grant citizenship to the Native Americans with the passage of the Massachusetts Enfranchisement Act of 1869, which ultimately led to the sale of any of the remaining lands.  Hassanamessit was divided up among a few families.  In 1897, the last of the Dudley lands were sold, and the remaining Native Americans were housed in the 'poor house' on Lake Street in [[Webster, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Holley, C. T.  (2001).  'Nipmuc History.'  Nipmuc Nation Website.  Retrieved from http://nipmucnation.homestead.com/files/nipmuc_history.txt.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intermarriage====
Intermarriage between Whites, Blacks or (''Chikitis''), and Native Americans began in early colonial times.   Africans and Native Americans shared a complementary gender imbalance as few female slaves were imported into [[New England]] and many of the Indian men were lost to war or the whaling industry.  Naturally, many unions between Native American women and African men occurred.  Intermarriage with [[Whites]] was uncommon, due to colonial [[anti-miscegenation]] laws in place.&lt;ref name="autogenerated72"&gt;Mandell, D. R. 'The Saga of Sarah Muckamugg: indian and African Intermarriage in Colonial New England.' ''Sex, love, race: crossing boundaries in north american history''. ed. Martha Elizabeth Hodes. New York, NY: New York Univ Pr. pp. 72-83.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Black Indians in the United States|children of such unions]] were accepted into the tribe as Native Americans, due to the matrilineal focus of Nipmuc culture, but to the eyes of their sceptical White neighbours, the increasingly Black [[phenotypes]] delegitimised their Indian identity.&lt;ref&gt;Minardi, M(2010). Making slavery history, abolitionism and the politics of memory in massachusetts. New York, NY: Oxford Univ Pr US. pp 60-63.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 19th century, only a handful of pure-blood Native Americans remained, and Native Americans vanish from state and federal census records but are listed as 'Black', '[[mulatto]]', '[[colored]]' or 'miscellaneous' depending on their appearance.&lt;ref name="autogenerated72"/&gt;

====Censuses====
In 1848, the [[Massachusetts Senate]] Joint Committee on Claims called for a report on the condition of several tribes that received aid from the Commonwealth.  Three reports were listed: The 1848 'Denney Report' presented to the Senate the same year; the 1849 'Briggs Report', written by Commissioners F. W. Bird, [[Whiting Griswold]] and Cyrus Weekes and presented to Governor [[George N. Briggs]]; and the 1859 'Earle Report', written by Commissioner [[John Milton Earle]] that was submitted in 1861.  Each report was more informative and thorough than the previous one.  The Nipmuc require having an ancestor listed on these reports and the disbursement lists of funds from Nipmuc land sales.  The lists did not count all Native Americans, as many Native Americans may have been well-integrated into other racial communities and due to the constant movement of Native Americans from place to place.

===20th century===
Attitudes towards [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] culture and history changed as antiquarians, [[anthropologists]], institutions like the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] as well as the 1907 appearance of [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] with many Native Americans in feathered headresses paying respects to Uncas, Sachem of the [[Mohegan people|Mohegan]].  Despite the nearly four centuries of [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilation]], acculturation, and the destruction of economic and community support from enfranchisement, certain Indian families were able to maintain a distinct Indian identity and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Mandell, D. R. (2011). Tribe, race, history: Native Americans in Southern New England, 1780–1880. (pp. 227-230). Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The turn of the century also saw active cultural and [[genealogical]] research by James L. Cisco and his daughter Sara Cisco Sullivan from the Grafton homestead, and worked closely with the remnants of other closely related tribes, such as [[Gladys Tantaquidgeon]] and the Fielding families of the [[Mohegan Tribe]], Atwood L. Williams of the [[Pequot]], and William L. Wilcox of the [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]].  Together, various tribal members began sharing cultural memory, with [[pan-Indianism]] firmly taking root in the 1920s with Indian gatherings such as the Algonquin Indian Council of New England that met in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] and dances or [[pow-wow]]s such as those at Hassanamessit in 1924.  [[Plains Indian]] costume was often worn as potent statements of Indian identity and to prove their continued residence in the area and because much of the original culture had been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Harkin, M. E. (2004). Reassessing revitalization movements: Perspectives from north america and the pacific islands. (p. 265-267). Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Nipmuc individuals appeared at town pageants and fairs, including the 1938 appearance at the [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]] bicentennial fair of many ancestors of today's Chaubunagungamaug Nipmuck.&lt;ref&gt;Artman, C.

By the 1970s, the Nipmuc had made many strides.  Many local members of the tribe were called upon to help with the development of the Native American exhibit at [[Old Sturbridge Village]], a 19th-century [[living museum]] built in the heart of former Nipmuc territory.&lt;ref&gt;Murphree, D. S. (2012). ''Native america: A state-by-state historical encyclopedia''. (p. 543). Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-Clio.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[State recognized tribes in the United States|State recognition]] was also achieved by the end of the same decade, re-establishing the Nipmuc people's relationship with the state and providing limited social services.  The Nipmuc sought [[Federally recognized tribes|federal recognition]] in the 1980s.  Tension between the Nipmuc Nation, which included the Hassanamisco and many descendants of the Chaubunagungamaug, based in [[Sutton, Massachusetts]], and the rest of the Chaubunagungamaug, based in [[Webster, Massachusetts]] split the tribe in the mid-1990s.  Divisions were caused by the frustrations with the slow pace of recognition as well as disagreements about gambling.&lt;ref&gt;Green, R. (28, September 28). Finding dims nipmuc casino prospects.

190 acres of the Hassanamessit Woods in [[Grafton, Massachusetts|Grafton]], believed to contain the remains of the praying village were under agreement for development for more than 100 homes.  This property has significant cultural importance to the [[Nipmuc Nation|Nipmuc Tribal Nation]] because it is thought to contain the meetinghouse and the center of the old praying village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tpl.org/media-room/hassanamesitt-woods-protection-moves-forward-ma#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=Hassanamesitt Woods Protection Moves Forward (MA)|last=|first=|date=|website=The Trust for Public Land|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[The Trust for Public Land]], the town of Grafton, the Grafton Land Trust, the [[Nipmuc Nation]] and the state of [[Massachusetts]] intervened.  [[The Trust for Public Land]] purchased the property and kept it off the market until 2004, after sufficient funding was procured to permanently protect the property.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tpl.org/media-room/hassanamesitt-woods-protection-moves-forward-ma#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=Hassanamesitt Woods|last=|first=|date=|website=The Trust for Public Land|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The property also has ecological significance as it is adjacent to 187 acres of Grafton owned land as well as 63 acres owned by the Grafton Land Trust.  These properties will provide numerous recreational benefits to the public as well as play a role in protecting the water quality of local watersheds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In July 2013, the Hassanamisco band selected a chief, [[Cheryll Toney Holley]] to succeed Walter Vickers upon his resignation.

'''Nora Wall''' (formerly '''Sister Dominic''') (born 1948) is a former [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Religious sisters|sister]] of the [[Sisters of Mercy]] who was wrongfully convicted of rape in June 1999, and served four days of a life sentence in July 1999, before her conviction was quashed. She was officially declared the victim of a [[miscarriage of justice]] in December 2005. The wrongful conviction was based on false allegations by two women in their 20s, Regina Walsh (born 8 January 1978) and Patricia Phelan (born 1973). Walsh had a psychiatric history and Phelan had a history of making false allegations of rape prior to the event. Phelan subsequently admitted to having lied.&lt;ref name="studiesirishreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.studiesirishreview.ie/catalogue/miscarriage-of-justice-paul-mccabe-and-nora-wall|title=Miscarriage of Justice:  Paul McCabe and Nora Wall|author=[[Breda O’Brien]]|work=Studies Irish Review|publisher=Irish [[Jesuits]]|accessdate=21 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309202654/https://www.studiesirishreview.ie/catalogue/miscarriage-of-justice-paul-mccabe-and-nora-wall|archive-date=9 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wall was the first woman in the history of the [[Éire|Irish State]] to be convicted of rape, the first person to receive a life sentence for rape and the only person in the history of the state to be convicted on [[repressed memory]] evidence. Her co-accused Pablo McCabe was a homeless [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] man. In relation to one of the two rape allegations, the defence showed that McCabe could not possibly have been there on the date in question. The jury acquitted McCabe on that count, and convicted him and Wall on the second rape charge. On 1 December 2005, the [[Court of Criminal Appeal in Ireland]] certified that Wall had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice. McCabe had died in December 2002.

The events took place following the airing of the documentary, ''[[States of Fear]]''.  A 2005 editorial in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' suggested that the programme influenced jury members and may have played a role in the [[miscarriage of justice]] against Nora Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/000938.html "Nora Wall case"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724031221/http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/000938.html |date=24 July 2011 }}.

==Biography - Nora Wall==
Wall was born in 1948 into a large, well-to-do farming family in the Nire Valley area of county Waterford. She  joined the Sisters of Mercy in 1967, taking the name Sister Dominic.

She joined St. Michael's residential childcare centre in [[Cappoquin]], County Waterford in 1975. It had been St Michael's industrial school but this was phased out at the end on the 1970s. Two, family style houses were built to house the children in the state's care there. She became the manager of this new St. Michael's in 1978.

The children at St. Michael's came from nearby counties Waterford and Tipperary. They were from troubled families who could not cope and there were often several members of one family in the home at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;"Final conversion from monster to martyr", by Ann Marie Hourihan, ''Sunday Tribune'', 1 Feb 2004 http://www.tribune.ie/archive/article/2004/feb/01/final-conversion-from-monster-to-martyr/{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography - Pablo (Paul) McCabe==
Pablo McCabe was also a local and almost the same age as Nora Wall.  McCabe was handed over to St. Michael's industrial school in 1951 when he was a baby.  
 
In 1988, McCabe addressed a gathering of the Sisters of Mercy in Gracedieu, Waterford. He spoke of being born in Dublin in 1949 to a single mother. She struggled until McCabe was three, but "had great difficulty in working, paying for accommodation and paying someone to look after me." Thus McCabe came to live in the "old St. Michael’s", the junior industrial school run by the Sisters of Mercy in Cappoquin. His memories were "very happy ones of caring and interested women." He then went to the Industrial School at [[Artane, Dublin]], which he found traumatic, because it had "over nine hundred boys in a very strict set-up." After leaving Artane, he began to drift and became involved with drugs, stealing to support his habit, and spent time in South America.  He returned to Ireland in 1977, receiving treatment at St. Brendan's Hospital, though alcohol abuse remained a problem.

In 1980, he came to Cappoquin again. He stated, "Cappoquin is my home. In Dublin I am homeless."&lt;ref name="studiesirishreview.ie" /&gt;  The old institution where he had been reared had been replaced with the group homes, where he first met Wall. He hoped to find information about his mother, but none existed. In 1986 his mother wrote, hoping to find him. Wall facilitated a reunion, and McCabe and his mother spent three days together in Cappoquin. She had married in England and had four more sons, but had never told her new family of Pablo’s existence.&lt;ref name="studiesirishreview.ie"&gt;"Miscarriage of Justice: Paul McCabe and Nora Wall" by Breda O'Brien, Winter 2006 edition of 'Studies' quarterly review - {{cite web|url=http://www.studiesirishreview.ie/j/page102 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118205630/http://www.studiesirishreview.ie/j/page102 |archivedate=18 November 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rape accusation, conviction, and appeal==

===Charges===
Wall left St. Michael's in 1990, and left the congregation of the [[Sisters of Mercy]] in 1994. In 1996, she worked in a [[St. Vincent de Paul]] shelter for homeless men. In October 1996, she was arrested in Dublin and questioned about allegations made by Regina Walsh, whom she had cared for from the age of eight. Walsh alleged that McCabe had raped her, while Wall held her legs, on the occasion of her twelfth birthday on 8 January 1990. She also claimed that Wall had sexually abused her on numerous occasions. Wall was not questioned then or subsequently on a second allegation: that she had assisted McCabe in raping Walsh in a virtually identical way two years previously. This latter charge, on which neither she nor McCabe was questioned, was the one on which they would subsequently be found guilty.

Wall maintained her innocence and was released without charge. She finished her contract with the [[St. Vincent de Paul]] and, after some time, got work with Sir Patrick Dunn’s Hospital, which she was forced to leave after the [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]] informed the hospital she should not be working with people. In May 1997 she was formally charged. She had to sign on at a Garda station twice a day and lived on social welfare.

===Arrest and trial===
McCabe was arrested on the same day in October 1996. Gardaí, who interviewed at the trial, admitted to making no notes, and, under pressure of questioning from defence counsel, also admitted that McCabe did not dictate a statement as they originally suggested, but responded to questions. This is in breach of regulations, which allow only minor clarifying questions during the taking of statements. McCabe had signed two statements that were strange in the way they were formulated. For example, part of the first statement says, "I told Sr. Dominic what had happened the night before in Regina’s room. I told her I had intimate relationships with her, meaning Regina. She said to me I was like St. Augustine."

At the trial a Garda claimed that he did not know that McCabe suffered from schizophrenia, and said  that he didn’t see what difference knowing whether he did or not would have made. McCabe made a further statement, concerning the night of Regina Walsh's 12th birthday party on 8 January 1990. The alleged rape on 8 January 1990 was the only charge on which McCabe was questioned. Like Nora Wall, he was never questioned on the second allegation that he had also raped Regina Walsh two years previously in 1987 or 1988, again with Wall present. In fact, neither McCabe’s nor Wall’s defence teams received notification of this second charge until 28 May 1999, only six days before hearings began, and two years after they were initially charged.

After he was released after questioning, it emerged that it would have been impossible for McCabe to have been in Cappoquin on 8 January. He was living in a Dublin hostel from 7 January and his movements were fully recorded until he was committed to Mountjoy prison on 10 January. The Gardaí then returned to Regina Walsh and put it to her that McCabe could not have been in Cappoquin on 8 January. On 5 November 1996, she "corrected" her statement to state that it was not the day of her 12th birthday, but of the celebration of her 12th birthday some days before or after that date, that the alleged assault took place. At the trial, witnesses were produced to show that there was no man present at the birthday party.&lt;ref&gt;Breda O'Brien (2006), [http://www.studiesirishreview.ie/j/page102 "Miscarriage of Justice: Paul McCabe and Nora Wall"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118205630/http://www.studiesirishreview.ie/j/page102 |date=18 November 2007 }}, ''Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review'', Issue 380, vol.95, Winter 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conviction===
On 11 June 1999 an RTÉ television news announcer stated that on the previous day &lt;blockquote&gt;A 51-year-old former Sister of Mercy, has been found guilty of raping a 10-year-old girl. Nora Wall, originally from the Nire Valley, had been the victim's guardian while the child was in care at St. Michael's Centre in Cappoquin in County Waterford. Nora Wall's co-accused, Paul McCabe, a homeless man, was also found guilty of rape. Both have been remanded on bail, for sentencing in July. The victim was placed in care in St. Michael's when she was 6 years of age. When she was ten, she was raped by Paul McCabe, a homeless man who visited Nora Wall at St. Michael's. The victim told the jury that the nun held her legs while the man raped her. Both Paul McCabe and Nora Wall denied the charges. The pair were acquitted of a second count of raping the same child in 1990. The jury had heard conflicting evidence surrounding the dates of the alleged offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/1999/0611/nun.html | work=RTÉ News | title=Former Sister of Mercy found guilty of rape | date=11 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second major charge against the two accused was that they had raped Regina Walsh in on 8 January 1990 on the girl's 12th birthday. The outcome was that the jury found the two accused innocent on that rape charge but convicted them on the other—the alleged rape that took place at least two years prior to the birthday party.&lt;ref&gt;Because of the non-guilty verdict, this allegation was not considered in the judgement of the Court of Criminal Appeal in December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Press reaction===
After the conviction the media used vicious language about Wall in particular - "Vile Nun", "Pervert Nun", "Mercy Devil", "I was Raped by Anti-Christ".&lt;ref&gt;A programme about her on [[RTÉ]]'s ''[[Would You Believe (TV series)]]'' series on 11 January 2000, gave a glimpse of some of the newspaper headlines&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
On 11 July 1999, the ''[[Sunday World]]'' carried a front page "exclusive" by crime correspondent [[Paul Williams (Irish journalist)|Paul Williams]]. Entitled "Rape Nuns Abuse Pact with Smyth", it claimed that &lt;blockquote&gt;Evil nun Nora Wall, convicted for helping to rape a ten-year-old child, also secretly provided children for sick [[Roman Catholic sex abuse cases|paedophile priest]] Father [[Brendan Smyth (priest)|Brendan Smyth]]. The ''Sunday World'' has learned that depraved cleric regularly visited St. Michael's Childcare Centre in County Waterford where Wall – then known as Sister Dominic – was working.&lt;/blockquote&gt; A female counsellor &lt;blockquote&gt;who works with the victims of this horror home revealed that Fr. Brendan Smyth may have abused children there. .....[she said] "the information is very reliable and also very disturbing".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sunday World]]'', 11 July 1999, [http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/002020.html Rape Nun's Abuse Pact with Smyth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; A few years later, Wall was to win EUR175,000 libel damages from the ''[[Sunday World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sunday World]]'', 27 October 2002, "Apology: Nora Wall", cited in Alliance Support Group, 21 October 2007, [http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/002021.html The Apology ''Sunday World'', 27 October 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108135125/http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/002021.html |date=8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That news received little attention from the media.&lt;ref&gt;The satirical ''[[The Phoenix (magazine)|Phoenix Magazine]]'' seems to be the only publication {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} that gave an account of the successful libel action - see ''Phoenix Magazine'', 8 November 2002, [http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/002019.html Worst Libels Nora Wall]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doubts about the conviction===
On 17 June, a week after the rape convictions,  Regina Walsh gave an interview to journalist Barry O'Keefe of ''The Star'' newspaper claiming that she had also been raped by a "black man in Leicester Square" in London.&lt;ref name="independent.ie"&gt;''Irish Independent'' 24 July 1999, http://www.independent.ie/national-news/exnun-gets-life-for-rape-403564.html#Scene_1&lt;/ref&gt; This was news to Wall's defence team. Moreover, ''The Star'' published the names of Walsh and her "witness" Patricia Phelan for the first time. A Kilkenny businessman read the newspaper and recognised Phelan as the woman who had made a false rape allegation against him, and the defence came into possession of this evidence.

===Sentenced===
On 23 July 1999   Wall and McCabe came before Judge [[Paul Carney]] for sentencing in the Central Criminal Court. Their counsel, Hugh Hartnett, sought an adjournment or a stay on any sentence. He told the court that there appeared to have been a grave breach of non-disclosure of evidence by the state. The state had not disclosed that Walsh alleged she had been raped in London. Neither had they disclosed that Phelan's allegations against an unnamed man had been dismissed in judicial review proceedings.

However Mr. Denis Vaughan Buckley for the state said that the Gardaí were not aware of these matters during their investigations, and rejected the claim that there had not been [[wikt:full disclosure|full disclosure]] of evidence, saying that these issues were not relevant to the case.

Passing sentence, the judge spoke of Wall's betrayal of the young girl. "This was a gang rape," he said. "The leader of the gang was the only person in the world who was charged with the protection of Regina Walsh. I don't think I need to say more than that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dodd|first=Stephen|title=Nun who led gang rape finds little mercy in court|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/nun-who-led-gang-rape-finds-little-mercy-in-court-519936.html|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]|date=25 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sentenced her to life imprisonment and McCabe to 12 years. The hearing was not held [[in camera]], as he said that Walsh and Phelan had forfeited their anonymity through newspaper interviews published since the trial.&lt;ref name="independent.ie"/&gt;

Nora Wall was the first woman convicted of rape in the history of the state and now became the first person to receive a [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]] for that crime.

The director of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, Olive Braiden, welcomed the imposition of a maximum sentence, and said it would ensure that Nora Wall would be monitored for the rest of her life to prevent recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Independent'', 24 July 1999, http://www.independent.ie/national-news/life-for-the-nun-who-raped-a-child-403560.html#Scene_1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convictions quashed===
Four days later on 27 July 1999, the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the convictions of the two accused. Both were granted bail and it was stated that the question of a possible re-trial would be considered subsequently. The [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] (DPP) applied to have the previous week's convictions set aside, telling the court that one witness had been called to give evidence at the trial inadvertently, despite a decision of the DPP that this person should not be called.

The Counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions also referred to two other additional though less central factors in the case. The first was the information that the alleged victim had made but not pursued an allegation of being raped in England. He said that whatever the significance of this information it could not be properly argued that it was not relevant. He said that the prosecution was not aware of this information until it was mentioned in court. There was also another as yet undisclosed factor relating to the alleged victim which might be considered relevant.&lt;ref&gt;RTÉ News, 27 July 1999 "Former rape nun's conviction quashed, http://www.rte.ie/news/1999/0727/nun.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction of Kevin Myers, July 1999===
On Saturday 31 July, the [[Irish Times]] published an article by writer and journalist [[Kevin Myers]]. He was one of the very few to speak out in favour of Wall and McCabe at the time. He originally wrote a column on Monday 26 July to be published on Wednesday but it was withdrawn because what he sought to achieve was already happening – the release of the two accused. He described the trial as a "witch-hunt": &lt;blockquote&gt;We should always beware the deeds of good men and women when there is a public war against vice of any kind. The "witches" of Salem were not persecuted by bad men or women; people then genuinely lived in fear of witchcraft, just as they did of communism in the 1950s. In the witch-hunt to remove it from public life in the US, innocent people's lives were ruined, yet through often honourable motives (apart from those of Joe McCarthy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/002046.html Nora Wall And Kevin Myers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Reaction of Sisters of Mercy ===
After their conviction, the [[Sisters of Mercy]] issued a statement, which read: &lt;blockquote&gt;We are all devastated by the revolting crimes which resulted in these verdicts. Our hearts go out to this young woman who, as a child, was placed in our care. Her courage in coming forward was heroic. We beg anyone who was abused whilst in our care to go to the Gardaí.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even after the collapse of the case against the two accused, the [[Sisters of Mercy]] made no effort to apologise to Wall or to withdraw their statement of support for Walsh. One commentator &lt;ref&gt;editor of the website www.inquisition21.com which campaigns against false allegations of child abuse&lt;/ref&gt; remarked: "The young woman their hearts were going out to, was the false accuser, not their own innocent nun. Our absolutist system had seduced them into identifying with the accuser and betraying their own sister."

===Court of Criminal Appeal===
Four months later, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr James Hamilton, decided to seek a retrial in the case. In mid-November he released to the media a detailed six-page report dated 1 October, addressed to the attorney general, Michael McDowell, SC, which gave an account of the mistakes, failures and omissions in the offices of the DPP and Chief State Solicitor and in the conduct of the case, which resulted in a witness for the prosecution being called against the wishes of the DPP. A DPP had never previously explained himself in a specific case in the office's 25-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Kevin|title=Nora Wall desperate for a fresh start after her sentence of shame|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/nora-wall-desperate-for-a-fresh-start-after-her-sentence-of-shame-521475.html|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]|date=21 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the attorney general declared that neither Wall nor McCabe would receive an apology, saying that the issue of an apology did not arise because the convictions had been quashed.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Irish Examiner]]'', 18 Nov 1999, [http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1999/11/18/ipage_22.htm "Family of former nun want 'travesty of justice' fully investigated"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629101632/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1999/11/18/ipage_22.htm |date=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Court of Criminal Appeal on 22 November 1999, the DPP accepted "fully and ungrudgingly" that former nun Wall and McCabe are entitled to be presumed innocent of all charges brought against them. At the court hearing a lawyer for the DPP said he "very much regrets the errors which occurred in relation to the handling of this case by the prosecution" which led to the successful appeal.

The DPP's statement outlined the sequence of events from the decision to prosecute on 24 April 1997 up to their release by the Court of Criminal Appeal, initially on bail, in July just days after they had been sentenced to life and 12 years respectively. It explained how the prosecution came to call Patricia Phelan as witness, despite an earlier direction by the DPP made in April 1997 that she should not be called.

Denis Vaughan Buckley SC, for the DPP, read a prepared statement. He said the DPP had considered the transcript of evidence that was given at the trial together with additional information obtained by the Gardaí and had concluded that it would not be proper to proceed with his application for a retrial. He added: &lt;blockquote&gt;I am instructed to emphasise that the director's concern to defend the propriety of the decision to charge the two accused does not in any sense detract from the fact, which is fully and ungrudgingly accepted by the director, that the two accused are entitled to be presumed innocent of all the charges which were brought, not only those of which they were acquitted by the jury but also of those which were set aside and which are not to be the subject of further proceedings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Presiding judge Mr Justice Murray sitting with Mr Justice Smyth and Mr Justice Kelly said the court would confirm the setting aside of the convictions, with no order for a retrial. The judges confirmed that neither Wall nor McCabe would have to pay the costs of their lengthy proceedings which could total around £60,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Independent'' 23 November 1999, "Botched rape case nun is innocent says DPP" http://www.independent.ie/national-news/botched-rape-case-nun-is-innocent-says-dpp-391400.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the court hearing, Wall pushed her way through the throng of reporters and family to catch up with Buckley, the prosecuting barrister. She extended her hand to the man who had presented the state's flawed case against her and said "thank you for what had just happened in court." According to Irish Independent journalist Aideen Sheehan, Buckley shook hands, looking taken aback at the unexpected gesture, so rare coming from the opposing side after such a serious criminal trial.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Irish Independent]]'', 23 Nov 1999, [http://www.independent.ie/national-news/botched-rape-case-nun-is-innocent-says-dpp-391400.html#Scene_1 "Nora Wall departs with a remarkable lack of bitterness"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2005 the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] finally certified that Wall had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice.

==Aftermath==

===Nora Wall ===

After her acquittal Nora Wall was asked by journalist Kevin Moore what she planned to do with the rest of her life: &lt;blockquote&gt;Well, I suppose to be practical and realistic people at my age are taking early retirement and being made redundant. And you know, what employer wants a person like me? They will ask what you have done for the last three years. I signed on twice a day at the garda station, had 32 court appearances, had a six-day trial in the Central Criminal Court, four days of a life sentence in the Joy, you know, what employer wants that?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wall described how she felt after she was arrested:&lt;blockquote&gt;I could not understand what they were saying to me at first. When they said "rape", I said that I was never raped. And it did not make sense. Then, they said that it happened in St. Michael's in Coiscéim. And it still did not make sense to me.  And then they said, Regina Walsh ... I was still turning around in my head how this could be. And then they mentioned Paul [McCabe]. That did not make sense at all to me. And then, when they told me what was supposed to have happened, I said, "Look, I could not think like that, never mind do a thing like that" ...  It was a full 11 months afterwards that I got the book of evidence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On her treatment by the Gardaí, Wall stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;Well, they could have been nicer to me verbally. I went on a bus to Knock and booked into a B&amp;B and the next morning I walked around Knock and went to Mass and I went into the Blessed Sacrament Church and I read the book of evidence there. And, after reading it, I was very much at peace with myself. I wrote to my brothers and sisters and I remember I used the 4 Ds ... I said that I had read the book and I can cope with it and there is nothing in it that I can't defend, deny, discuss, or debate...  I have no ill feeling against Regina and Patricia.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Independent'', 21 November 1999 http://www.independent.ie/national-news/nora-wall-desperate-for-a-fresh-start-after-her-sentence-of-shame-521475.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Religious affairs journalist [[Breda O'Brien]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;It would be easy to demonise the two young women, but Nora Wall will have none of it. Regina Walsh had spent time in St. Declan’s Psychiatric Unit, after a suicide attempt, immediately prior to making the allegations. Regina and Patricia were vulnerable people, she maintains, and she in particular commends Patricia for having the courage to eventually admit that she had lied. It had a particular poignancy, because Patricia was her "first baby", reared since 13 months of age in Coisceim. After the miscarriage of justice was declared, Nora extended her hand to Patricia and told her that she was "still her first baby", which caused Patricia to fall into her arms and cry uncontrollably.&lt;ref name="studiesirishreview" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nora Wall currently lives in a private apartment on the grounds of Cuan Mhuire (a narcotic and alcohol rehabilitation centre) just outside the town of Athy in Co. Kildare.

===Pablo McCabe ===
Although there were two persons accused of rape, the media focused almost exclusively on Nora Wall. An exception is the detailed account of the case by [[Breda O'Brien]] in Studies Review entitled: "Miscarriage of Justice: Paul McCabe and Nora Wall". She quotes the words of Linda Loman in [[Arthur Miller]]'s '[[Death of a Salesman]]', about her husband Wille Loman enduring humiliation at the end of his career; &lt;blockquote&gt;"I don't say he's a great man... His name was never in the paper. He's not the finest character that ever lived. But he's a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid. He's not to be allowed to fall in his grave like an old dog. Attention, attention must finally be paid to such a person."&lt;ref name="studiesirishreview" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After his release from prison in July 1999 Pablo McCabe lived in Oak House, a hostel for homeless men in the inner city of Dublin and over the next three years lived the typical life of the homeless. Short on cash he would get drunk now and then and try to bully other men to bring alcohol into the rooms which was forbidden. At those times he would become belligerent and offensive.

His physique had been broken down over the years by alcohol and poor diet and was further weakened by a stroke. When speaking to men in the hostel and nearby day centre, he always maintained his innocence of the rape, but said that the mud had stuck. His mother wrote to him from England but he did not reply to her letters. He had four stepbrothers in Liverpool but made no attempt to contact them. In November 2002 he had a seizure in the hostel and was rushed to the [[Mater Misericordiae University Hospital|Mater Hospital]] where six weeks later after a number of other collapses he died, a few days before Christmas. His mother Helen and stepfather were informed but because of illness could not travel immediately.

His remains were kept in the mortuary of the Mater until the family could travel. His mother and his stepfather attended the funeral in the Franciscan Church in Merchant's Quay, Dublin, on 14 January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;'Pablo' may now find peace in anonymity", article by Michael Sheridan in Sunday Independent 19 January 2003 http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/pablo-may-now-find-peace--in-anonymity-487947.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court of Criminal Appeal, 1 December 2005===
On 16 December 2005 the three judges of the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] gave detailed reasons for their decision. They began by providing a summary of the legal background as follows (minor editorial changes have been made for the purpose of clarity): 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
On 10 June 1999, Nora Wall was convicted by the Central Criminal Court of rape contrary to common law and of indecent assault contrary to common law as punishable by s.10 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981. On 23 July 1999, she was sentenced by the Central Criminal Court to imprisonment for life for the offence of rape and to 5 years imprisonment for indecent assault.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;On 27 July 1999, Nora Wall brought a bail application before the Court of Criminal Appeal, at which point senior counsel on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) conveyed to that court the DPPs consent to the granting of leave to appeal, and further consented that the appeal be allowed and that a retrial be directed. This startling turn of events was referable to (a) the inadvertent calling as a witness on behalf of the prosecution, Patricia Phelan, a person whom the DPP had specifically directed should not be so called at the trial and (b) matters regarding the complainant, Regina Walsh, which had not been disclosed to the lawyers representing the applicant prior to trial.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;On 22 November 1999, counsel for the DPP indicated to the court of criminal appeal that the DPP was not proceeding with an application for a retrial. Counsel further indicated that the DPP “fully and ungrudgingly” accepted that the applicant was entitled to be presumed innocent of all charges preferred against her. The court accordingly quashed the conviction of Nora Wall and the sentences imposed in respect thereof.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''In the main body of the judgement''', the three judges went on to find that, due to the withholding of important information by the prosecution, including the investigating police, at the trial stage, it was not until appeal that the court heard a substantial body of significant evidence that had not been disclosed to the defence.

'''Concerning the complainant, Regina Walsh''', the evidence that had not been disclosed to the defence included that she:

# had been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness and admitted to a psychiatric hospital and undergone treatment;
# had a recollection of events that arose as the result of "flashbacks" and had no full memory or recall of those events;
# had previously made a false allegation that she was raped; and
# had previously falsely alleged that she had been assaulted.

'''Concerning the witness Phelan,''' the prosecution had failed to disclose that:

# prior to the trial, a direction had been made that she not be called as a witness as she was regarded as being unreliable;
# she had made allegations against her late uncle and another man over an alleged rape, and that the High Court had made findings adverse to her credibility and reliability;
# the police officer who had taken her statement in respect of the complainant was the same police officer who investigated the earlier false complaints made by her against her uncle and against the other man;
# the DPP and the Chief State Solicitor had the carriage of the proceedings in the High Court in which the adverse findings against her had been made;
# subsequent to the conviction and sentence of Nora Wall, Phelan disclosed to another nun, Sister Mona Kileen, that she had lied in her statement and that she had given false evidence against the applicant;
# there was a strong risk of collusion between Phelan and the complainant Walsh.

The judges noted that in her further statement of 2 April 2001, Phelan in part stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the trial, held at the [[High Court (Ireland)|Central Criminal Court]] in Dublin, I gave evidence on oath in the complaint against Nora Wall and Paul McCabe. In evidence, I told the judge and jury that I saw Paul McCabe rape Regina and that Nora Wall was present holding Regina's legs down. I gave other evidence but I cannot remember what. At the time I gave this evidence in court, I knew it was wrong and against the law but I just wanted to get back at Dominic (i.e. Nora Wall). I was also afraid to pull back on my evidence because I thought that once I had made a statement I had to give evidence in court. The reason why I wanted to get back at Dominic was because she used to physically beat me when I was living the Group Homes. She gave me a terrible life and I hated her. I remember ringing Sr. Mona Kilkeen. She was a good friend of mine for many years. It was during the trial, but I cannot remember much of the details.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] found that a miscarriage of justice had occurred, and that there had been a serious breakdown in communications between the offices of the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]], the Chief State Solicitor, the [[Garda Síochána]] (police) and prosecuting counsel.

The court made particular reference to a file note contained within the file of the DPP which was in the following terms:

;Evidence of Patricia Phelan
&lt;blockquote&gt;Local Gardaí who have dealings with her during previous investigations have found her most unreliable. She never mentioned to the members anything about a rape at any time. Therefore her evidence should not be accepted as accurate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the appeal bench, Justice Kearns found that "there had been significant non-disclosure in this case, including (a) the information that Regina Walsh had made, but not pursued, an allegation of being raped in England, and (b) the non-disclosure of Regina Walsh's very proximate and material psychiatric history" .

He also found that: &lt;blockquote&gt;the applicant was further prejudiced during the course of her trial by evidence of which the defence had no prior notification, namely, that Regina Walsh recalled the alleged episodes of rape by reference to "flashbacks and/or retrieved memory", while there was "no scientific evidence of any sort adduced to explain the phenomenon of flashbacks and/or retrieved memory.&lt;ref&gt;Judgement of the Irish Court of Criminal appeal delivered on 16 December 2005 (Director of Public Prosecutions and Nora Wall - CCA 147/99) - British and Irish Legal Information Institute, [http://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IECCA/2005/C140.html D.P.P.-v- Nora Wall - 2005 IECCA 140 (16 December 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''Journal of the Law Society of New South Wales'' (Australia) for June 2006 has an article by solicitor Greg Walsh entitled "Criminal Law: Obligation is on prosecutors to disclose". This includes a detailed discussion on the Nora Wall case. This section of the article can be found on the Alliance Support website at {{cite web |url=http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/002008.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108143633/http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/002008.html |archivedate=8 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] confirmed Nora Wall's innocence, she approached Patricia Phelan. According to [[Irish Independent]] journalist Ann O'Loughlin "Immediately after the court's decision, Ms Wall, with her hand outstretched, approached Ms Phelan. A tearful Ms Phelan threw her arms around Ms Wall and hugged her." &lt;ref&gt;''[[Irish Independent]]'', 2 December 2005, [http://www.independent.ie/national-news/conviction-of-nun-for-rape-a-miscarriage-of-justice-223936.html "Conviction of nun for rape a miscarriage of justice"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the handling of the case==

===Mr Justice Paul Carney===
Short-lived criticism of the judge centered not so much on his description of Nora Wall as a "gang rapist" but on the sentence of life imprisonment he imposed on her. University College Galway law lecturer Tom O'Malley said that the life sentence was completely unexpected as past cases of serial and serious child sex abuse had attracted sentences of between eight and 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Independent'', 1 Aug 1999, [http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/exnun-caught-on-a-legal-seesaw-520016.html "Ex-nun caught on a legal see-saw"]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Nora Wall case however, Mr Justice Carney struck some rather different notes. In 1999, Carney told a seminar in South Africa that some alleged victims of rape might be pressured into continuing with complaints they were reluctant to pursue. "Such pressure could come from parents, boyfriends, policemen, prosecutors, rape crisis centres and victim support counsellors," he said. "I have no way of knowing whether such pressure exists, but I would be very concerned if it does, particularly in relation to those cases which can be profiled as unlikely to result in a conviction."

In April 2003, at a Women Lawyers' Association conference, Carney dismissed the claim of the director of the Rape Crisis Centre (RCC) that there was no such thing as a false sexual charge. "This is not the experience of the courts," he said. "In relation to the balance of rape cases which are contested, there is a majority of acquittals." The judge also criticised an RCC counsellor for suggesting in a victim impact statement that the severity of sentence imposed on a rapist would determine the degree to which the victim became "reconciled with the justice system". Carney said it was a "serious abuse of process" for the author of a victim impact report to use it to campaign for a heavy sentence.

The former director of the Rape Crisis Centre, Olive Braiden, clashed with Carney at the conference. "He launched into a criticism of a senior counsel who was not present, and I said I regretted that he had raised the matter in her absence," she said.

The above examples are taken from a detailed profile of Mr Justice [[Paul Carney]] in ''The Sunday Business Post'' on 13 April 2003, written by barrister and author Kieron Wood. The article is entitled "Judge With One Eye On The Media". It includes some critical comments and notes that "His time on the bench was marked by controversy". Nevertheless, it contains no reference to the case of Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2003/04/13/story135990641.asp Judge with one eye on the media | The Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310152104/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2003/04/13/story135990641.asp |date=10 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The DPP ===
On 6 September 1999, the Irish Independent reported the views of the Dáil (Irish parliament) opposition party Justice spokesman Jim Higgins: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Director of Public Prosecutions faced a barrage of criticism for its handling of the high profile case. Fine Gael's justice spokesman Jim Higgins said it was dealt with sloppily the prosecution pursued the case "with vigour and determination"  but on the day after the convictions the DPP moved to have them quashed.

"There are two issues here," said Mr Higgins. "The first is how a witness could have been called to give evidence against the expressed wishes of the DPP. The other is the non-disclosure of evidence. It is common law principle that all material in possession of the prosecution must be handed over to the defence, even if it is damaging to the prosecution's case. We have to investigate whether that evidence was withheld deliberately or inadvertently."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Devlin |first=Martina |title=Former nun may not face retrial over rape charges |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/former-nun-may-not-face-retrial-over-rape-charges-396016.html |accessdate=28 December 2012 |date=6 September 1999 |work=Irish Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The issue of non-disclosure of evidence in the Nora Wall case was not followed up in Ireland but did attract some attention abroad. The ''Journal of the Law Society of New South Wales'' (Australia) for June 2006 has an article by solicitor Greg Walsh entitled "Criminal Law: Obligation is on prosecutors to disclose". This includes a detailed discussion on the Nora Wall case.&lt;ref&gt;This section of the article can be found on the Alliance Support website at {{cite web |url=http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/002008.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108143633/http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/002008.html |archivedate=8 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there seems to be no equivalent article in the journal of the Irish Law Society.

===The Gardaí and the Chief State Solicitor's Office ===
On 21 November 1999, Liz Allen, crime correspondent for the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]],'' wrote that the Chief State Solicitor's Office which dealt with the Nora Wall case also dealt with a previous case involving a sexual assault allegation by Patricia Phelan, the woman who was later mistakenly called as a witness against Nora Wall.

In the Patricia Phelan case in 1997 (in which she accused the Kilkenny businessman), Mr Justice McCracken carried out a High Court judicial review and decided that there should not be a trial. The state asked for time to consider whether it would appeal this decision, but three weeks later, the then DPP, Eamon Barnes, ordered the Chief State Solicitor's Office to return to court to say it did not wish to proceed any further with the case it was taking on behalf of Patricia Phelan and another woman.

The ''Sunday Independent'' obtained documentation dated May 1997, which shows that the Chief State Solicitor's Office wrote to the solicitor for the Kilkenny businessman in the case taken on behalf of Ms Phelan, providing a list of witnesses who had made statements which the state intended to use in its case. ''This list included the name of Nora Wall''.

When details of the DPP's report on the blunders in the Nora Wall case were released by the Attorney General's office on 17 November 1999, there were no references to the documentation linking the Chief State Solicitor's Office to both cases. The report failed to explain why the DPP did not want Ms Phelan called as a witness. The DPP's statement said only that she was mistakenly called because prosecuting counsel "failed to recall" an earlier direction not to call her.

In his decision in the judicial review of the original Phelan case on 5 January 1997, Mr Justice McCracken said: "While I have great sympathy for [the two women], I have to say that I was not particularly impressed with their evidence." He added, however, that this was "not a deciding factor" in his decision to prevent the DPP from taking the man to trial.

Liz Allen quoted Fine Gael's justice spokesman, Jim Higgins, as stating that the establishment of this link between the case originally taken by Ms Phelan and the Wall case merited a judicial inquiry "to investigate the role of Gardaí and the Chief State Solicitor's Office." Higgins continued: "There now has to be a full inquiry into the roles of all of the agencies involved, the role of the Chief State Solicitor's Office, the DPP's Office and the Gardaí must be investigated further. We must question the ability of these people to conduct their jobs when such gross incompetence occurred in the Wall case with regard to the inadvertent calling of Ms Phelan as a witness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Allen |first=Liz |title=Nora Wall case witness known to Chief State Solicitor's Office |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/nora-wall-case-witness-known-to-chief-state-solicitors-office-521478.html |accessdate=28 December 2012 |newspaper=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]] | date=21 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, the close links that existed between personnel involved in the case against Nora Wall and that against the Kilkenny businessman - both involving Patricia Phelan - makes it difficult to understand how Phelan could have been called in error as a witness in the Wall case. The December 2005 judgement of the Court of Criminal Appeal underlined these links when the judges pointed out that "the police officer who had taken Phelan's statement in respect of Nora Wall was the same police officer who investigated the earlier false complaints made by her against her uncle and against the Kilkenny man." However Jim Higgins's calls for an inquiry were ignored and this issue was quickly dropped by the media.

==Summary==
The case of Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe established a number of extraordinary precedents in Irish law.

# Nora Wall was the first woman in the history of the State to be convicted of rape;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wall may not be re-tried if inquiry finds rights were infringed|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1999/07/30/ihead_17.htm|newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=30 July 1999|quote="Ms Wall, a former Mercy Order nun, became the first women in the history of the State to be convicted of rape when she was sentenced to life in prison."|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629101819/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1999/07/30/ihead_17.htm|archivedate=29 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# She was the first person in Ireland to receive a life sentence for rape;&lt;ref&gt;"Legal experts are baffled by the severity of the sentence given to the former nun. During the trial it was alleged Nora Wall held a 10-year-old girl while Paul McCabe raped her, yet for all the horror of the evidence, little precedent existed for the scale of the sentences. Nora Wall was given a life term, while her co-accused was given a 12-year sentence. Past cases of serial and serious child sex abuse have attracted sentences between eight and 12 years. UCG law lecturer Tom O'Malley says the life sentence was completely unexpected." - ''[[Irish Independent]]', 1 Aug 1999, [http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/exnun-caught-on-a-legal-seesaw-520016.html Ex-nun caught on a legal see-saw]&lt;/ref&gt;
# It was the only case in the history of the Office of the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] that a witness was called contrary to the instructions of the DPP;&lt;ref&gt;"The DPP's letter says that it is the first time in 25 years that this type of error has occurred." - RTÉ News, 17 November 1999, [http://www.rte.ie/news/1999/1117/nun.html DPP decides against retrial in Wall-McCabe case]&lt;/ref&gt;''
# Regina Walsh said she had recalled the rapes after experiencing "flashbacks". This seems to be the only occasion a conviction was obtained on [[repressed memory]] evidence in Ireland. (However in the USA "repressed memory syndrome" has a long and contentious history).&lt;ref&gt;Extract from the judgement of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 16 December 2005 "It seems to this court that the applicant was further prejudiced during the course of her trial by evidence of which the defence had no prior notification, namely, that Regina Walsh recalled the alleged episodes of rape by reference to 'flashbacks and/or retrieved memory'. There was no scientific evidence of any sort adduced to explain the phenomenon of 'flashbacks' and/or 'retrieved memory', nor was the applicant in any position to meet such a case in the absence of prior notification thereof." - British and Irish Legal Information Institute, [http://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IECCA/2005/C140.html D.P.P.-v- Nora Wall [2005&amp;#93; IECCA 140 (16 December 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe were convicted on 10 June 1999; Regina Walsh gave her famous interview to ''The Star'' on 17 June including her allegation about being raped in London; the Kilkenny businessman recognised the name of Patricia Phelan and contacted the defence but still the DPP remained in ignorance of the facts. At the sentencing hearing on 23 July the DPP refused the defence's application for an adjournment and denied that the newly discovered evidence was relevant. Finally Judge [[Paul Carney]] made his comments about Nora Wall and gave her an unprecedented sentence of life imprisonment.

==Explanations for miscarriage of justice ==

Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe were originally accused in 1996 shortly after the broadcast by [[RTÉ]] of the [[Documentary film|TV documentary]] "Dear Daughter" in February of that year; they were convicted in June 1999 one month after RTÉ's broadcast of the ''[[States of Fear]]'' series produced by [[Mary Raftery]].

It is widely acknowledged that Nora Wall was convicted because of the atmosphere generated by the ''States of Fear'' series (see ''States of Fear'' subsection below). It is also accepted – not least by [[Mary Raftery]] herself – that "Dear Daughter" was an important predecessor to ''States of Fear''. In the book ''Suffer the Little Children'' published in November 1999 as a follow up to her TV series, [[Mary Raftery]] and her co-author Eoin O'Sullivan wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Dear Daughter'' concerned the experiences at Goldenbridge Industrial School, Dublin, of Christine Buckley, who grew up there during the 1950s. She had suffered horrific abuse, and descriptions were also given of the systematic ill-treatment of other children by the [[Sisters of Mercy]], who ran the school. These included memories of children being routinely and savagely beaten, having boiling water poured over them, being locked in a furnace room, being forced to stand all night in a corridor as punishment, and very young children being made to sit on potties so long that in some cases their rectums collapsed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors go on to say that "the programme produced an enormous response, most of it horrified at the deeply shocking nature of the abuse outlined," However they also acknowledge that the Sisters of Mercy had their defenders and that after the programme two sisters who were at Goldenbridge gave different accounts of one alleged episode. However they conclude  that: "Three years later, the testimony of severe abuse in industrial schools is now so overwhelmingly consistent, that the 'false memory' line of argument has not been repeated in relation to the flood of accounts of abuse during 1999." &lt;ref&gt;Mary Raftery and Eoin O. Sullivan, ''Suffer the Little Children: The Inside Story of Ireland’s Industrial Schools'', New Island, Dublin, 1999, p. 240/41&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus [[Mary Raftery]] believes that any apparent contradictions brought to light in the controversy that followed "Dear Daughter" were fully ironed out by the ''States of Fear'' programmes.

=== "Dear Daughter" ===
In February 1996 [[RTÉ]] broadcast "Dear Daughter" – [[Louis Lentin]]'s TV documentary about alleged abuse in St Vincent’s residential school, Goldenbridge, Dublin, which was run by the [[Sisters of Mercy]]. It featured the story of Christine Buckley who had been there in the 1950s.

The documentary concentrated on allegations made against one Mercy nun Sister Xavieria. The programme claimed that, on one occasion, Christine Buckley had been caned by Sister Xavieria so severely that the entire side of her leg was split open from her hip to her knee. She said that she was treated in the casualty department of the local hospital and believes that she received 80 to 120 stitches. No medical evidence has ever been produced to support this claim.

The surgeon who ran the casualty department at the hospital has made a statement which renders it highly unlikely that such an incident ever took place. The surgeon pointed out that caning would not have caused a wound of this kind, which would have required surgical treatment under a general anaesthetic and not stitches in a casualty department.&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Times (Ireland), 28 April 1996, citing the views of the surgeon, J. B. Prendiville. The text of the article "Medical view 'inconsistent' with Goldenbridge abuse' is at http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/000250.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the allegations against the Sisters of Mercy were widely believed at the time. In his essay "''States of Fear'', the Redress Board and Ireland's Folly", UK cultural historian Richard Webster states that "in the wake of the broadcast, atrocity stories about Goldenbridge and other industrial schools began to proliferate".&lt;ref&gt;"''States of Fear'', the Redress Board and Ireland's Folly" http://www.richardwebster.net/brynestynireland.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe were accused by Regina Walsh within months of the broadcast of "Dear Daughter". Her "witness" Patricia Phelan accused the Kilkenny businessman of rape at about the same time. It was his testimony that would eventually cause the collapse of the case against Wall and McCabe.

=== ''States of Fear'' ===
In April and May 1999 [[RTÉ]] broadcast a much more extensive three-part documentary series, [[States of fear]], which was written, produced and directed by [[Mary Raftery]]. The programmes portrayed the industrial schools as part of a chaotic and Dickensian child-care system, which was run by the Catholic Church and funded by the state. The programmes also featured a series of claims by former residents of the schools that they had been physically or sexually abused by members of orders such as the Christian Brothers, the Sisters of Mercy and the Sisters of Charity. References were also made to a number of unexplained deaths which allegedly took place in these schools.&lt;ref&gt;"Mary Raftery and the Death of Patsy Flanagan" includes media correspondence between Raftery and her critics in 1999/2000 in relation to the death of a boy in Artane industrial school in 1951 {{cite web |url=http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/001338.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724031246/http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/001338.html |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series provoked a huge public response. As Raftery herself puts it, "Outrage at the crimes committed against these children was expressed continuously for the three weeks of the series, across acres of newsprint and hours of radio broadcasts all over the country." &lt;ref&gt;Mary Raftery and Eoin O. Sullivan, ''Suffer the Little Children: The Inside Story of Ireland’s Industrial Schools'', New Island, Dublin, 1999, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of this outbreak of outrage the religious orders were demonized. The following is an extract from an article by Irish journalist Stephen Dodd on 9 May 1999, entitled "Church Needs Public Exorcism Over Abuse"&lt;blockquote&gt;In Australia, hundreds of orphaned children were flogged, beaten and sexually abused at a [[Sisters of Mercy]] orphanage in Queensland. The regime of abuse is believed to have lasted 90 years. One child was said to have been burned with a red-hot poker to ''exorcise the devil''. A nun pulled out another child's ingrown toenails with a pair of pliers. Girls were raped by priests and male workers. Some became pregnant and miscarried. It is alleged that foetuses were flushed down lavatories to cover up the crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Independent, 9 May 1999 http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/church-needs-public-exorcism-over-abuse-518890.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The final programme in the series was broadcast on 11 May 1999. Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe were convicted of rape on 10 June.

Carol Coulter, legal affairs correspondent for the ''[[Irish Times]]'' wrote on 1 December 2005 that "[The case] took place at a time of heightened sensitivity to the problem of the sexual abuse of children in institutions, especially those run by religious orders. The RTÉ series ''States of Fear'' had ended a month earlier, generating widespread debate and indignation." &lt;ref&gt;''[[The Irish Times]]'', 1 December 2005, [http://www.oneinfour.org/news/news2005/vulnerable/ Handling of vulnerable witnesses crucial] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130415122037/http://www.oneinfour.org/news/news2005/vulnerable/ |date=15 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Irish Times|''Irish Times'']] editorial on 17 December 2005 entitled "Nora Wall" stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;The charges were laid at a time when allegations of the abuse of children in institutions had entered the public domain. The case was heard within a month of the broadcast by RTÉ of the ''States of Fear'' programmes. The jury could not but have been affected, it seems, by the horrific abuse exposed in that series and by the complaints of the child victims that no-one listened to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/000938.html Nora Wall Case&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724031221/http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/000938.html |date=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wall told teacher and religious affairs journalist Breda O'Brien that she has no doubt that the atmosphere generated by ''States of Fear'' was a central factor in the jury's willingness to believe the allegations.&lt;ref name="studiesirishreview" /&gt; In addition, the opinion of the ''[[Irish Times]]'' is significant as in 1999 [[Mary Raftery]] was both a columnist for the Times ''and'' a senior producer/director with RTÉ.&lt;ref&gt;"Raftery, Mary" {{cite web |url=http://www.newisland.ie/node/121 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527035901/http://www.newisland.ie/node/121 |archivedate=27 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus on the ''States of Fear'' programmes may explain why, apart from news reports on trial days, RTÉ's coverage of the scandal was confined to a 30-minute programme in the ''Would You Believe'' series on 11 January 2000.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Irish Independent]]'', 9 Jan 2000, [http://www.independent.ie/national-news/nora-wall-speaks-publicly-about-rape-trial-ordeal-512507.html "Nora Wall Speaks Publicly About Rape Trial Ordeal"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 1999, the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'' published an article entitled "Judge reflects a nation's outrage" by columnist Emer O'Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/judge-reflects-a-nations-outrage-521549.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Judge reflects a nation's outrage | date=13 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title refers to the sentencing by Judge Anthony Murphy of a Brother of Charity to 36 years imprisonment for the physical and sexual abuse of children. However the article contains these words about the Nora Wall case: &lt;blockquote&gt;When the former Mercy nun Nora Wall was vindicated, and an announcement was made that she was not to be retried for rape, there was an outcry from some members of the public about the way she had been vilified before her conviction was set aside. The horrible reality of our society is that so many appalling crimes of abuse of children by Catholic religious have been proved in the courts that many people are inclined to believe that no cleric, man or woman, accused of such crimes can possibly be innocent. And that is not the fault of public opinion. It is in large measure the fault of the religious authorities who seem more concerned with limiting the damage to their own reputations and standing than in acknowledging their collective guilt and active negligence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25957">'''The political and religious views''' of filmmaker '''[[Stanley Kubrick]]''' (1928–1999) have been subjects of speculation during his lifetime and after his death. While early films like ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' (1957)  seem to reflect an overtly progressive ideology, later films such as ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971) can be construed as equally critical of the political left and right. Despite the lack of commitment to a particular world-view, it is generally agreed that Kubrick was fascinated by the possibilities of a supernatural reality, as reflected in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980).

==Politics==
In his memoir of Kubrick, Michael Herr, his friend and co-writer of the screenplay for ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987), wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Stanley had views on everything, but I would not exactly call them political... His views on democracy were those of most people I know, neither left nor right, not exactly brimming with belief, a noble failed experiment along our evolutionary way, brought low by base instincts, money and self-interest and stupidity... He thought the best system might be under a [[Enlightened despotism|benign despot]], though he had little belief that such a man could be found. He wasn't a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]], but he could have easily passed for one. He was certainly a capitalist. He believed himself to be a realist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Herr recalls that Kubrick was sometimes akin to a 19th-century liberal-humanist, that he distrusted almost all authority, that he once alluded to [[Irving Kristol]]'s definition of a neoconservative ("a liberal who has been mugged by reality") in a favorable way, and that he was "seemingly" a [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]].&lt;ref name="Herr2001_11"&gt;[[#Herr2001|Herr 2001, pp. 11–12.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Herr further wrote that Kubrick owned guns and did not think that war was an entirely bad thing. In the documentary ''[[Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures]]'', Herr says "…he also accepted that it was perfectly okay to acknowledge that, of all the things war is, it's also very beautiful." The writer said of initial reactions to ''Full Metal Jacket'' that "The political left will call [[Kubrick]] a fascist."&lt;ref name="Rose1987"&gt;[[#Rose1987|Rose 1987.]] Online at: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/movies/features/kubrick1987.htm Stanley Kubrick, at a Distance]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1987 interview with [[Gene Siskel]], called ''Candidly Kubrick'', Kubrick said, "''Full Metal Jacket'' suggests there is more to say about war than it is just bad." He added that everything serious the drill instructor says, such as "A rifle is only a tool, it is a hard heart that kills", is completely true.&lt;ref name="Philips2001_198"&gt;[[#Philips2001|Philips 2001, p. 198.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederic Raphael]], who co-authored the ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' script with Kubrick, says that the director once remarked that "Hitler was right about almost everything", and insisted that any trace of Jewishness be expunged from the ''Eyes Wide Shut'' script. Kubrick's supposed relationship to his own ethnicity deeply troubled Raphael, a fellow Jew. Raphael was further puzzled over Kubrick's cryptic praise for Hitler, unable to decide if Kubrick was jesting. Raphael was equally puzzled by Kubrick's trashing of ''[[Schindler's List]]''. After Raphael mentioned ''Schindler’s List'', Kubrick replied: “Think that's about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn't it? The Holocaust is about six million people who get killed. 'Schindler's List’ is about 600 who don’t."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/archive-fever-stanley-kubrick-and-the-aryan-papers "Is Schindler's List fatally flawed?" – The Jewish Chronicle]&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick's friend [[Steven Spielberg]], the director of the film, disbelievingly responded that he "didn't recognize the voice of Stanley" in Raphael's interviews.&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/1999/voices/columns/kubrick-memoir-shocks-spielberg-1117503222/&lt;/ref&gt;

Though some have said Kubrick disliked America, Michael Herr says that America was all he talked about and that he often thought of moving back.&lt;ref name="Herr2001_46"&gt;[[#Herr2001|Herr 2001, p. 46.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Herr wrote that Kubrick was sent VHS tapes from American friends of [[American football|NFL Football]], ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and other television shows that he could not get in the United Kingdom. Kubrick told Siskel that he was not anti-American and thought that America was a good country, though he did not think that [[Ronald Reagan]] was a good president. In the interview, he also predicted an economic meltdown worldwide by pointing out to Siskel that most of the major banks in the United States held dubious foreign bonds as collateral and huge third world loans treated as assets.&lt;ref name="Philips2001_186"&gt;[[#Philips2001|Philips 2001, p. 186.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick likened this to the [[Hans Christian Andersen]] fairy tale about the "Emperor's New Clothes", and felt even during the Cold War, an economic collapse was more worrisome and imminent than nuclear annihilation was. As far as Kubrick's views on welfare and taxation, according to [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]], Kubrick said of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|pre-1997]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] that "If the Labourites ever get in, I’ll leave the country." Watson claims that Kubrick feared being ruined by tax-the-rich policies and was opposed to welfare in general.&lt;ref name="Watson2000"&gt;[[#Watson2000|Watson 2000.]] Online at: [http://www.ianwatson.info/kubrick.htm Plumbing Stanley Kubrick] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703134444/http://www.ianwatson.info/kubrick.htm |date=2008-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick's earlier work is seen by Pauline Kael as more [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] than his later work.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kagan|Kagan 2000, pp. 65, 66, 71, 134.]] "a world the liberal Dax will not accept"; Kael: "Strangelove ... concealed its own liberal pieties"&lt;/ref&gt; (She also viewed his early work much more favorably.) The early films embody liberal ideals, and the satire of government and military in ''Dr. Strangelove'' seems to point to a liberal political perspective. Similarly, film analyst Glenn Perusek thinks Kubrick's earlier ''Paths of Glory'' reflects a [[Rousseau]]ist vision of man with natural human sympathy crushed by the artifice of society; later Kubrick films abandon that perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Perusek in anthology ''Depth of Field'' edited by Cocks, Diedrick, Perusek&lt;/ref&gt; While Kael viewed ''Dr. Strangelove'' as a liberal film, Kagan disagrees, holding the film to be written from the point of view of a detached realist, lacking the overt liberalism of similar anti-war films of the era such as ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' or ''[[Fail Safe (1964 film)|Fail-Safe]]''.&lt;ref name="Kagan_119"&gt;[[#Kagan|Kagan 2000, pp. 65–67, 134–135.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick's more mature works are more pessimistic and suspicious of the so-called innate goodness of mankind, and are critical of stances based on that positive assessment. For example, in ''A Clockwork Orange'', the police are as violent and vulgar as the droogs, and Kubrick depicts both the subversive liberal writer Mr. Alexander and the authoritarian status quo Minister of the Interior as manipulative and sinister. Kubrick commented regarding ''A Clockwork Orange'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Man isn't a [[noble savage]], he's an ignoble savage. He is irrational, brutal, weak, silly, unable to be objective about anything where his own interests are involved—that about sums it up. I'm interested in the brutal and [[violent]] nature of man because it's a true picture of him. And any attempt to create social institutions on a false view of the nature of man is probably doomed to failure.&lt;ref name="McGregor1972"&gt;[[#McGregor1972|McGregor 1972.]] Online at: [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/film/013072kubrick-profile.html Nice Boy from the Bronx?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He went on to say:&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea that social restraints are all bad is based on a [[utopian]] and unrealistic vision of man. But in this movie, you have an example of social institutions gone a bit berserk. Obviously, social institutions faced with the law-and-order problem might choose to become grotesquely oppressive. The movie poses two extremes: it shows Alex in his precivilized state, and society committing a worse evil in attempting to cure him."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When ''New York Times'' writer Fred M. Hechinger wrote a piece that declared ''A Clockwork Orange'' "[[fascist]]", Kubrick responded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is quite true that my film's view of man is less flattering than the one [[Rousseau]] entertained in a [[Emile,_or_On_Education|similarly allegorical narrative]]—but, in order to avoid fascism, does one have to view man as a noble savage rather than an ignoble one? Being a pessimist is not yet enough to qualify one to be regarded as a [[tyrant]] (I hope)... The age of the alibi, in which we find ourselves, began with the opening sentence of Rousseau's ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'': 'Nature made me happy and good, and if I am otherwise, it is society's fault.' It is based on two misconceptions: that man in his natural state was happy and good, and that primal man had no society... Rousseau's romantic fallacy that it is society which corrupts man, not man who corrupts society, places a flattering gauze between ourselves and reality. This view, to use Mr. Hechinger's frame of reference, is solid box office but, in the end, such a self-inflating illusion leads to despair.&lt;ref name="HechlingerKubrickSite"&gt;[[#HechlingerKubrickSite|Kubrick Site (no date).]] Online at: [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0037.html The Hechinger Debacle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kubrick quoted extensively from [[Robert Ardrey]], author of ''[[African Genesis]]'' and ''[[The Social Contract (1970 book)|The Social Contract]]''—not to be confused with Rousseau's—and author [[Arthur Koestler]] from his book ''[[The Ghost in the Machine]]''. Both authors (Koestler through [[psychology]] and Ardrey through [[anthropology]] and evolutionary theory) searched for the cause of humanity's capacity for death and destruction, and both, like Kubrick, were suspicious of the liberal belief in the innate goodness of mankind. Ardrey and Kubrick both attribute this belief to Rousseau, who, in Ardrey's words, "Fathered the romantic fallacy".

When asked by [[Michel Ciment]] in an interview if he was an [[Anarchism|anarchist]], Kubrick replied: "I am certainly not an anarchist, and I don't think of myself as a pessimist. I believe very strongly in parliamentary democracy, and I am of the opinion that the power and authority of the State should be optimized and exercised only to the extent that is required to keep things ''civilized''."&lt;ref name="Ciment1982Clockwork"&gt;[[#Ciment1982Clockwork|Ciment 1982.]] Online at: [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html Kubrick on A Clockwork Orange: An interview with Michel Ciment]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his interview with ''The New York Times'', Kubrick stated that his view of mankind's innate capacity for violence and terror was closer to those of Christianity than to humanism or Jewish theology, saying, "I mean, it's essentially Christian theology anyway, that view of man."

Kubrick appeared to believe that freedom and [[Social liberalism|social libertarianism]] is still worth pursuing even if mankind is ultimately ignoble, and that evil on the part of the individual—however undesirable—is still preferable in contrast to the evil of a totalitarian society. Kubrick said in an interview with [[Gene Siskel]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To restrain man is not to redeem him... I think the danger is not that authority will collapse, but that, finally, in order to preserve itself, it will become very repressive... Law and order is not a phony issue, not just an excuse for the Right to go further right.&lt;ref name="Philips2001_156"&gt;[[#Philips2001|Philips 2001, p. 156.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Religion==

Kubrick came from a secular family background and "was known to have said that he was not really a Jew, he just happened to have two Jewish parents."&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Webster, ''Love and Death in Kubrick: A Critical Study of the Films from Lolita Through Eyes Wide Shut'', McFarland, 2010, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Though his father's legal name was Jacob, he went by Jacques or Jack as a move towards American assimilation.&lt;ref name="Cocks2004_23"&gt;[[#Cocks2004|Cocks, p. 23.]]&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by Michel Ciment in an interview if he had a religious upbringing, Kubrick replied: "No, not at all."&lt;ref name="Ciment1982Shining"&gt;[[#Ciment1982Shining|Ciment 1982a.]] Online at: [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.ts.html Kubrick on The Shining: An interview with Michel Ciment] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QSnEvFKT?url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.ts.html |date=July 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kubrick's interview with [[Craig McGregor]], he said:&lt;ref name="HechlingerKubrickSite"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''2001'' would give a little insight into my metaphysical interests... I'd be very surprised if the universe wasn't full of an intelligence of an order that to us would seem God-like. I find it very exciting to have a semi-logical belief that there's a great deal to the universe we don't understand, and that there is an intelligence of an incredible magnitude outside the Earth. It's something I've become more and more interested in. I find it a very exciting and satisfying hope.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When asked by [[Eric Nordern]] in Kubrick's interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' if ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' was a religious film, Kubrick elaborated:&lt;ref name="krusch-q12"&gt;[[#krusch-q12|The ALT.MOVIES.KUBRICK FAQ.]] Extract: [http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/Q12.html What did Kubrick have to say about what 2001 "means"?]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I will say that the [[God]] concept is at the heart of ''2001'' but not any traditional, [[anthropomorphic]] image of God. I don't believe in any of Earth's [[monotheistic]] religions, but I do believe that one can construct an intriguing scientific definition of God, once you accept the fact that there are approximately 100 billion stars in our [[galaxy]] alone, that each star is a life-giving sun and that there are approximately 100 billion galaxies in just the visible universe. Given a planet in a stable orbit, not too hot and not too cold, and given a few billion years of chance chemical reactions created by the interaction of a sun's energy on the planet's chemicals, it's fairly certain that life in one form or another will eventually emerge. It's reasonable to assume that there must be, in fact, countless billions of such planets where biological life has arisen, and the odds of some proportion of such life developing intelligence are high. Now, the sun is by no means an old star, and its planets are mere children in cosmic age, so it seems likely that there are billions of planets in the universe not only where intelligent life is on a lower scale than man but other billions where it is approximately equal and others still where it is hundreds of thousands of millions of years in advance of us. When you think of the giant technological strides that man has made in a few millennia—less than a microsecond in the chronology of the universe—can you imagine the evolutionary development that much older life forms have taken? They may have progressed from [[Organism|biological species]], which are fragile shells for the mind at best, into [[immortality|immortal]] machine entities—and then, over innumerable eons, they could emerge from the [[chrysalis]] of matter transformed into beings of pure energy and [[spirit]]. Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence ungraspable by humans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same interview, he also blames the poor critical reaction to ''2001'' as follows:&lt;ref name="krusch-q12"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps there is a certain element of the lumpen literati that is so dogmatically atheist and [[materialist]] and Earth-bound that it finds the grandeur of space and the myriad mysteries of cosmic intelligence [[anathema]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1969 interview to American Cinematographer, Kubrick expressed his atheism when asked if there was an unseen cosmic intelligence or god behind the events in ''2001'':&lt;ref name="Smith2010"&gt;[[#Smith2010|Smith 2010, p. 68.]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole idea of god is absurd. If anything, ''2001'' shows that what some people call "god" is simply an acceptable term for their ignorance. What they don't understand, they call "god"... Everything we know about the universe reveals that there is no god. I chose to do Dr. [[Arthur C. Clarke|[Arthur C.] Clarke]]'s story as a film because it highlights a critical factor necessary for human evolution; that is, beyond our present condition. This film is a rejection of the notion that there is a god; isn't that obvious?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also commented on people who saw religious or spiritual connotations in ''2001'':&lt;ref name="Smith2010"&gt;[[#Smith2010|Smith 2010, p. 68.]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It's simply not there, religion and spirituality. Sufficiently advanced beings could be capable of things we might not even be able to understand — though these things would all make perfect sense to an advanced civilization, I suspect that these people to whom you refer are simply calling what they don't understand in my film "god".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview with William Kloman of ''The New York Times'', when asked why there is hardly any dialogue in ''2001'', Kubrick explained:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't have the slightest doubt that to tell a story like this, you couldn't do it with words. There are only 46&amp;nbsp;minutes of dialogue scenes in the film, and 113 of non-dialogue. There are certain areas of feeling and reality—or unreality or innermost yearning, whatever you want to call it—which are notably inaccessible to words. Music can get into these areas. Painting can get into them. Non-verbal forms of expression can. But words are a terrible straitjacket. It's interesting how many prisoners of that straitjacket resent its being loosened or taken off. There's a side to the human personality that somehow senses that wherever the cosmic truth may lie, it doesn't lie in A, B, C, D. It lies somewhere in the mysterious, unknowable aspects of thought and life and experience. Man has always responded to it. Religion, [[mythology]], [[allegories]]—it's always been one of the most responsive chords in man. With [[rationalist movement|rationalism]], modern man has tried to eliminate it, and successfully dealt some pretty jarring blows to religion. In a sense, what's happening now in films and in popular music is a reaction to the stifling limitations of rationalism. One wants to break out of the clearly arguable, demonstrable things which really are not very meaningful, or very useful or inspiring, nor does one even sense any enormous truth in them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Stephen King]] recalled Kubrick calling him late at night while he was filming ''The Shining'' and Kubrick asked him, "Do you believe in God?" King said that he had answered in the affirmative, but has had three different versions of what happened next. One time, he said that Kubrick simply hung up on him. On other occasions, he claimed Kubrick said, "I knew it", and then hung up on him. On yet another occasion, King claimed that Kubrick said, before hanging up, "No, I don't think there is a God." In more recent interviews, King has had yet another version of the "God" story, in which Kubrick calls King and asks him if he thinks ghost stories are optimistic because they all suggest there is life after death. King replies, "What about hell?" There is a pause and Kubrick says, "I do not believe in hell."

Finally, Katharina Kubrick Hobbs was asked by alt.movies.kubrick if Stanley Kubrick believed in God. Here is her response:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.movies.kubrick/msg/93d412d7e01b9d0d|title=Re: Questions for KCKH|author=Katharina Kubrick Hobbs|date=2000-07-14|message-id=03c8dffa.1823bc9e@usw-ex0104-031.remarq.com|newsgroup=alt.movies.kubrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hmm, tricky. I think he believed in ''something'', if you understand my meaning. He was a bit of a fatalist actually, but he was also very superstitious. Truly a mixture of nature and nurture. I don't know exactly what he believed, he probably would have said that no-one can really ever know for sure, and that it would be rather arrogant to assume that one could know. I asked him once after The Shining, if he believed in ghosts. He said that it would be nice if there "were" ghosts, as that would imply that there is something after death. In fact, I think he said, "Gee I hope so."...He did not have a religious funeral service. He's not buried in consecrated ground. We always celebrated [[Christmas]] and had huge Christmas trees.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures'', [[Jack Nicholson]] recalls that Kubrick said ''The Shining'' is an overall optimistic story because "anything that says there's anything after death is ultimately an optimistic story."

{{Rape |state=autocollapse}}
{{masculism sidebar}}
A significant proportion of victims of [[rape]] or other [[sexual violence]] incidents is [[male]]. Historically, rape was thought to be, and defined as, a crime committed solely against women. This belief is still held [[Laws regarding rape|in some parts of the world]], but '''rape of males''' is now commonly criminalized and has been subject to more discussion than it was in the past.&lt;ref name="Rabin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rabin|first=Roni Caryn|title=Men Struggle for Rape Awareness|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/health/as-victims-men-struggle-for-rape-awareness.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=30 November 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rape of males is still [[taboo]], and has a negative connotation among [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]] men.&lt;ref name=irish&gt;Deborah Condon. April 4th 2014. Irish Health. [http://www.irishhealth.com/article.html?id=23456 Male rape 'still a taboo subject']. Comments of Dr Maeve Eogan and Deirdra Richardson in ''Modern Medicine, the Irish Journal of Clinical Medicine''.&lt;/ref&gt; Community and service providers often react to the [[sexual orientation]] of male victims and the gender of their perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult for a male victim, straight or gay, to report the [[sexual assault]] that was experienced by him, especially in a society with a strong [[masculine]] custom. They are afraid that people will doubt their sexual orientation and label them as gay, especially if raped by a male, or that they may be seen as un-masculine because they were a victim. A perception of being gay is also a motive for rape in many cases.&lt;ref&gt;Priya M Menon. February 16, 2013. The Times of India, [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Lacking-support-male-rape-victims-stay-silent/articleshow/18524668.cms Lacking support, male rape victims stay silent].&lt;/ref&gt;

Mostly, male victims try to hide and deny their victimization, similar to female victims, unless they have serious physical injuries. Eventually, the male victims may be very vague in explaining their injuries when they are seeking medical or mental health services.&lt;ref name=richard/&gt; 

==Research and statistics==
===General===
[[File:US Sexual Victimization 2014.png|thumb|right|450px|Looking across different government survey sources, for a given year male adult and youth inmates are estimated to suffer several times more incidents of sexual victimizations than incarcerated females. Male and female inmates are not included in most national surveys of sexual victimization.&lt;ref name="Rosin"&gt;{{cite web|last = Rosin|first = Hanna|title = When Men Are Raped|publisher = ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''|date = April 29, 2014|accessdate = February 12, 2015|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/04/male_rape_in_america_a_new_study_reveals_that_men_are_sexually_assaulted.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stemple&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stemple|first1=Lara|last2=Meyer|first2=Ilan H.|title=The Sexual Victimization of Men in America: New Data Challenge Old Assumptions|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=June 2014|volume=104|issue=6|pages=e19–26|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2014.301946|pmid=24825225|pmc=4062022}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The research about male-victim rape only appeared less than 30 years ago, focusing mostly on male children. The studies of sexual assault in correctional facilities focusing specifically on the consequences of this kind of rape were available in the early 1980s, but nothing was available during the previous years. Most of the literature regarding rape and sexual assault focuses on female victims.&lt;ref name=richard&gt;Richard Tewksbury. Department of Justice Administration, University of Louisville. [http://www.prearesourcecenter.org/sites/default/files/library/effectsofsexualassaultsonmen-physicalmentalandsexualconsequences.pdf Effects on Sexual Assaults on Men: Physical, Mental and Sexual Consequences]. International Journal of Men's Health, Vol 6, No 1, Spring 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only recently have some other forms of sexual violence against men been considered.  In the 2010–2012 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (and a prior edition of this study completed in 2010), the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) measured a category of sexual violence called "being made to penetrate" which captures instances in which victims were forced to or attempt to sexually penetrate someone (of either sex), either by physical force or coercion, or when the victim was intoxicated or otherwise unable to consent. The CDC found in the 2012 data that 1.715&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name="NISVS 2012" /&gt; (up from 1.267&amp;nbsp;million in 2010)&lt;ref name="NISVS 2010" /&gt; reported being "made to penetrate" another person in the preceding 12 months, similar to the 1.473&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name="NISVS 2012" /&gt; (2010: 1.270&amp;nbsp;million)&lt;ref name="NISVS 2010" /&gt; women who reported being raped in the same time period. The definitions of rape and "made to penetrate" in the CDC study were worded with extremely similar language.&lt;ref name="NISVS 2010" /&gt;

===Male-on-male rape===
Male-on-male rape has been heavily [[Social stigma|stigmatized]]. According to psychologist Sarah Crome, fewer than 1 in 10 male-male rapes are reported. As a group, male rape victims reported a lack of services and support, and legal systems are often ill-equipped to deal with this type of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Male rape victims left to suffer in silence|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s244535.htm|date=February 9, 2001|accessdate=2007-05-30|publisher=abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies argue that male-male [[Prison rape|prisoner rape]], as well as female-female prisoner rape, are common types of rape which go unreported even more frequently than rape in the general population.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]] [https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2001/prison/report7.html#_1_48 No Escape: Male Rape In U.S. Prisons. Part VII. Anomaly or Epidemic: The Incidence of Prisoner-on-Prisoner Rape.]; estimates that 100,000–140,000 violent male-male rapes occur in U.S. prisons annually; compare with [http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2007/offenses/violent_crime/forcible_rape.html FBI statistics] that estimated 90,000 violent male-female rapes occur annually.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Robert W. Dumond, "Ignominious Victims: Effective Treatment of Male Sexual Assault in Prison," August 15, 1995, p. 2; states that "evidence suggests that [male-male sexual assault in prison] may a staggering problem"). Quoted in {{Cite book|last1=Mariner|first1=Joanne|last2=(Organization)|first2=Human Rights Watch|title=No escape: male rape in U.S. prisons|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QkFfYfEO5IgC&amp;pg=PA370|accessdate=7 June 2010|date=2001-04-17|publisher=Human Rights Watch|isbn=978-1-56432-258-6|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Struckman-Johnson |first1=Cindy |last2=Struckman-Johnson |first2=David |year=2006 |title=A Comparison of Sexual Coercion Experiences Reported by Men and Women in Prison |journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=1591–1615 |issn=0886-2605 |pmid=17065656 |doi=10.1177/0886260506294240}}; reports that "Greater percentages of men (70%) than women (29%) reported that their incident resulted in oral, vaginal, or anal sex. More men (54%) than women (28%) reported an incident that was classified as rape."&lt;/ref&gt; The rape of men by men has been documented as a weapon of terror in warfare (see also [[War rape]]).&lt;ref name="Storr"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/17/the-rape-of-men|title=The rape of men : Society : The Observer|last=Storr|first=Will|date=17 July 2011|work=[[The Observer]]|publisher=Guardian.co.uk|accessdate=17 July 2011|quote=Sexual violence is one of the most horrific weapons of war, an instrument of terror used against women. Yet huge numbers of men are also victims.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the [[Syrian Civil War]] (2011–present), the male detainees experienced sexual abuse such as being forced to sit on a broken glass bottle, getting their genitals tied to a heavy bag of water, or being forced to watch the rape of another detainee by the officials.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International. 2012.

===Female-on-male rape===
Female-on-male rape is under-researched compared to other forms of sexual violence.&lt;ref name="Nicole Fisher"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Nicola|title=An overview of the literature on female-perpetrated adult male sexual victimization|url=https://kar.kent.ac.uk/33378/3/Fisher%20%2526%20Pina%20REVISED%20FV%20AVB%2010-05R.pdf|publisher=University of Kent|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics on the prevalence of female-on-male sexual violence vary.

Regarding female-on-male sexual misconduct, the US Dept. of Justice reports in its opening statement (page 5): "An estimated 4.4% of prison inmates and 3.1% of jail inmates reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual victimization by another inmate or facility staff in the past 12 months or since admission to the facility, if less than 12 months." Regarding female-on-male sexual misconduct (page 25) it states: "Among the 39,121 male prison inmates who had been victims of staff sexual misconduct, 69% reported sexual activity with female staff; an additional 16% reported sexual activity with both female and male staff (table 18)." and "Nearly two-thirds of the male jail inmates who had been victimized said the staff perpetrator was female (64%)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, 2008–09|url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/svpjri0809.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several widely publicized cases of female-on-male [[statutory rape]] in the United States involved school teachers having illegal sex with their underage students (see [[Mary Kay Letourneau]] and [[Debra Lafave]]). Male victims, including underage minors, have been forced to pay [[child support]] to their rapist when the rapist conceives a baby as a result of the rape (see, for example, ''[[Hermesmann v. Seyer]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/06/us/court-tells-youth-to-support-child-he-fathered-at-age-13.html | title=Court Tells Youth to Support Child He Fathered at Age 13 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2016-03-20 |date=1993-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/male-statutory-rape-victim-nick-olivas-must-pay-child-support-2014-9 | title=Arizona Is Requiring A Male Statutory Rape Victim To Pay Child Support | publisher=Business Insider |accessdate=2016-03-20 |date=2014-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-12-22/features/9612220045_1_pay-child-support-child-support-behalf |title=Statutory Rape Victim Ordered To Pay Child Support |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=2016-03-20 |date=1996-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths regarding male victims of rape==

===Males are not vulnerable===
{{unreferencedsection|date=January 2018}}
By [[masculinity|masculine]] [[Gender role#Socialization|gender socialization]], it is thought that males, even younger males, cannot be victims of rape, nor even that they are vulnerable. In some societies, it is considered shameful and unmanly if a male child cries, because the male stereotype depicts males as being able to protect themselves, which may not always be the case.&lt;ref name=hurt&gt;Hidden Hurt. 2011. [http://www.hiddenhurt.co.uk/male_victims_of_domestic_violence.html Male Victims of Domestic Violence].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=male&gt;Male Survivor.[http://www.malesurvivor.org/myths.html Male Sexual Victimization Myths &amp; Facts].&lt;/ref&gt; Young boys may be weaker and vulnerable to perpetrators, who are usually stronger. The perpetrators can use whatever they have to [[child sexual abuse|abuse the child]], including money or other bribes.&lt;ref name=male/&gt; An adult male may also be helpless to fight back, or fearful of doing so because of the possibility of being arrested for assault and/or battery due to social double standards regarding the use of force in self-defense between genders, in some cases of female perpetrators (this double standard is similar to the concern of male self-defense against non-sexual assault by a female).

===Males always want sex===
A common societal belief is that a male must be aroused if he gets an erection or has an orgasm, therefore that means that they are willing and enjoying any sexual activity. Roy J. Levin and Willy Van Berlo wrote in an article in the Journal of Clinical Forensic Medicine that slight genital stimulation or stress can create erections "even though no specific sexual stimulation is present". An erection does not mean that the men consent to sex.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; Males can get erections even in [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] or painful sexual situations, and this does not indicate consent.&lt;ref name=male/&gt;

Much like female erectile response, male [[erection|erectile response]] is involuntary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1007/BF01541979| title=Sexual molestation of men by women| author=Philip M.

Arousal and stimulation are distinct things. Stimulation is a physical response to a stimulus. Men can be physically stimulated without feeling aroused and thus causing an erection.

===Traumatization===
One notion is that males are less traumatized by the abuse experience than females are; this includes the belief that males are less negatively affected.&lt;ref name="timesi"&gt;For example, Mumbai Advocate [[Flavia Agnes]] said, "The consequences of rape for a woman are far-reaching. She has to battle social stigma, social mindset. While fixing marriages, nobody asks a man if he is a virgin." ("Activists oppose making rape gender-neutral". ''The Times of India'', July 20, 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that the long-term effects are damaging for either sex and males may especially be more damaged by social stigma and disbelief of their victimization.&lt;ref name=male/&gt; It is noted by Eogan and Richardson that male victims tend to feel more intense anger than female victims, while both go through similar feelings of distress after the rape.&lt;ref name=irish/&gt; Frazier (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Frazier Patricia A | year = 1993 | title = A comparative study of male and female rape victims seen at a hospital-based rape crisis program | url = | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 64–76 | doi=10.1177/088626093008001005}} Cited from Jai Vipra.

She found that the depression and hostility are more profound on male victims immediately post-rape than on female victims.

Trauma recovery counselor Stephanie Baird says men who experience sexual attention as children often explain it to themselves as "I'm a stud, I got laid by&amp;nbsp;...". Baird explains that they do this in order to feel as if they had some power and say.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; Carpenter (2009, citing Mezey, 1987)&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Simon. 2009.

===Sexual orientation===
{{see also|Sexual orientation|Sexual identity}}
Henry Leak, the chairman of the Survivors organization, stated that rape of males, as with females, has more to do with power than sexuality, and does not only happen inside the homosexual community.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;Kathy Marks. 15 October 1992. The Independent, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/man-abducted-from-train-and-raped-1557478.html Man abducted from train and raped].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual orientation]] is a complex issue, and the majority of male perpetrators who seek out boys are not homosexual.&lt;ref name=male/&gt;

Male sexual assault victims often fear being seen as gay or weak, or believe that their assault may be due to their appearance being effeminate or homosexual so as to attract other males. Experts do not believe that premature sexual experiences play a significant role in later sexual orientation. Research by Jane Gilgun, Judith Becker and John Hunter states that while many perpetrators may have experienced sexual abuse of their own, most sexual assault victims will not go on to become adolescent perpetrators.&lt;ref name=male/&gt;

==During armed conflict==
{{Further information|Wartime sexual violence}}
Rape of males during wartime has been reported as being very prevalent in some parts of the world, such as [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref name=Melhado&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melhado|first=L|title=Rates of Sexual Violence Are High in Democratic Republic of the Congo|journal=International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|volume=36|number=4|year=2010|p=210|jstor=41038670}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Autesserre&gt;{{cite journal|last=Autesserre|first=Séverine|title=Dangerous Tales: Dominant Narratives on the Congo and their Unintended Consequences|journal=African Affairs|volume=111|issue=443|year=2012|pages=202–222|doi=10.1093/afraf/adr080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many male refugees who have escaped from the civil war in Congo to Uganda have been raped. Across Africa, men who are raped often face social [[stigmatization]], accusations of [[homosexuality]] (which is illegal in many countries of the region), and being ridiculed for being "weak" and failing to prevent the rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/17/the-rape-of-men|title=The rape of men: the darkest secret of war|author=Will Storr|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dw.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/male-rape-victims-in-uganda-speak-out/a-16809077|title=Male rape victims in Uganda speak out|website=DW.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/04/2013411111517944475.html|title=Male rape survivors fight stigma in Uganda|author=Grace Natabaalo|website=aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In northern Uganda, in recent years there have been ongoing attacks by rebel groups against the government forces. During these conflicts, civilian men have often been attacked, kidnapped, raped and forced to fight for the rebel groups.&lt;ref name="dw.de"/&gt;

==Effects==

===Physical effects===
Sexual abuse results in severe [[emotional trauma|emotional]] and often [[physical trauma]].&lt;ref name="male2"&gt;Male Survivor. [http://www.malesurvivor.org/survivors.html Survivors].&lt;/ref&gt; Among sexual assault victims over 18, 31.5% of females and 16.1% of males said that they incurred non-genital injuries from the assault.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Justice. 2006. Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Rape Victimization: Findings From the National Violence Against Women Survey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Male victims received more ancillary injuries and were more likely to be threatened with a weapon by the perpetrator. The symptoms and injuries most frequently noted are tension headaches, ulcers, nausea, colitis, abrasions to the throat, black eyes and broken bones. The study by Stermac and colleagues (2004) noted that 45% of male survivors who went to a hospital sexual assault centre had some type of physical injury (25% [[soft tissue injury]], 20% [[laceration]]s).&lt;ref name=irish/&gt;&lt;ref name=richard/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=donald&gt;S. McDonald and A. Tijerino (Research and Statistics Division-Department of Justice Canada. 2013. [http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/cj-jp/victim/rr13_8/rr13_8.pdf Male Survivors of Sexual Abuse and Assault: Their Experiences].&lt;/ref&gt;

The data from hospital emergency rooms show that male rape victims are more likely to have non-genital injuries than females, and that they are more likely to neglect seeking medical attention if the injuries are not significant. Hodge and Canter (1998) report that homosexual male victims are more likely to sustain serious injuries than heterosexual male victims. Sometimes victims become infected by a [[sexually transmitted disease]] as the result of rape, but it is infrequent and includes only a small portion of male victims.&lt;ref name=richard/&gt;

===Psychological effects===
Rape victims, males and females, may find it difficult to report the [[sexual assault]] against them. There is a myth that a male sexual assault victim will become a perpetrator themselves. This myth is very damaging to victims, both to their mental states and to how people treat them.&lt;ref name=male/&gt; Elizabeth Donovan, a psychotherapist, stated that males have the added burden of facing a society that does not believe that rape can happen to them at all.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

Since most studies have found that people tend to [[blame the victim]] of rape for the incident, a study called ''Gender Differences in Attributions of Blame for Male Rape Victims'' in the ''Journal of Interpersonal Violence'' focused on where the blame lies in rape cases. In cases of female rape victims, a higher proportion of males than females tend to blame the victim for the sexual assault. In order to show whether male or female respondents blamed the rape victim at a higher rate, this study utilized a story of a man being raped to see if the blame was placed on the victim or the assaulter. After performing the experiment, researchers found that a statistically significant proportion of males tend to blame the victim, even when the rape victim is a male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Whatley Mark A., Riggio Ronald E. | year = 1993 | title = Gender Differences in Attributions of Blame for Male Rape Victims | url = | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 502–511 | doi = 10.1177/088626093008004005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study implies that even in cases of male sexual victimization, the male victims are held responsible for the assault by the majority of the uninvolved population.

====Long-term effects====
Compared to men who have not been sexually assaulted, men who were sexually assaulted before age 18 have a greater risk of having mental health problems, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression; alcoholism and drug abuse; suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts; problems in intimate relationships; and underachievement at school and at work.&lt;ref name="1in6"&gt;1in6.org. [https://1in6.org/the-1-in-6-statistic/ The 1 in 6 Statistic].&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of gender expectations, being a male child victim of sexual abuse can lead to:&lt;ref&gt;Living Well. [http://www.livingwell.org.au/managing-difficulties/dealing-with-the-effects/ Dealing with the effects].&lt;/ref&gt;
#Pressure to prove his manhood physically and sexually (becoming stronger and engaging in dangerous or violent behavior; having multiple female sexual partners).
#Confusion over gender and sexual identity.
#Sense of being an inadequate man.
#Sense of lost power, control, and confidence to his manhood.
#Problems with closeness and intimacy.
#Sexual problems.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;William H. Masters in his study (1986) finds sexual dysfunction and disorder to the men who have been raped by women. He may also been unable to respond his female partner physically, even to two years after the raping. They lost their "sense of personal dignity and confidence in [their] masculinity." ("Sexual dysfunction as an aftermath of sexual assault of men by women", Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy 12, no. 1: 35–45. Cited from Jai Vipra. July 2013. CCS working Paper #286, [http://ccsinternship.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/286_case-for-gender-neutral-rape-laws-in-india_jaai-vipra.pdf A Case for Gender-Neutral Rape Laws in India].)&lt;/ref&gt;
#Fear of becoming 'homosexual' or 'gay'.
#[[Homophobia]].

====Suicide possibility====
{{see also|Gender differences in suicide}}
The suicide rate for sexually abused males is 14 to 15 times higher than for other males.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, W. C., M.D., MSCE, and G.B. Slap, M.S., Sexual Abuse of Boys. 280(1) Journal of the American Medical Association (1998): 1855–1862, citing numerous studies.&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald and Tijerino found in their research that some participants state that there were occasions on which they felt so bad that they engaged in self-harming behaviors, including suicide attempts, and/or had suicidal thoughts.&lt;ref name=donald/&gt; There is also a study that shows that rape victims are 4.1 times more likely to contemplate suicide and 13 times more likely to attempt suicide than non-crime victims.&lt;ref&gt;Health Consequences of Sexual Abuse. 9(7) The Harvard Mental Health Letter  (Jan. 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Males have a much higher rate of completed suicide than females.&lt;ref name="Canetto"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Canetto, Silvia | title=The Gender Paradox in Suicide | journal=Suicide and Life Threatening Behavior | volume=28 | issue=1 | page=5 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1943-278X.1998.tb00622.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false | doi=10.1111/j.1943-278X.1998.tb00622.x| doi-broken-date=2018-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One common explanation relies on the social constructions of [[hegemonic masculinity]] and [[femininity]]. In a review of the literature on gender and suicide, male suicide rates were explained in terms of traditional gender roles. Male gender roles tend to emphasize greater levels of strength, independence, and risk-taking behavior.&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The social construction of gender and its influence on suicide: a review of the literature | journal=Journal of Men's Health | volume=5 | issue=1 | pages=23–35  | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875686708000146 | doi=10.1016/j.jomh.2007.11.002| author=Payne, Sarah | displayauthors=1 | author2=and others | year=2008 | last3=Stanistreet | first3=Debbi L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reinforcement of this gender role often prevents males from seeking help for suicidal feelings and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref name="Moller"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Möller-Leimkühler, Anne Maria  | title=The gender gap in suicide and premature death or: why are men so vulnerable?  | journal=European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience  | volume=253  | issue=1 | pages= 1–8 | doi=10.1007/s00406-003-0397-6| pmid=12664306  | year=2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healing therapy===
Sexual assault victims need extensive emotional and psychological healing after the raping, but male survivors are not likely to speak out their cases. Elizabeth Donovan, a psychotherapist, said; "Males have the added burden of facing a society that doesn't believe rape can happen to them ... at all."&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

==Prevalence==

===United States===
The CDC reports in 2010 stated that nearly 1 in 5 women, 1 in 71 men in the U.S. have been raped or have had an experience of attempted rape, while 4.8% of men reported they were made to penetrate someone else at some time in their lives.&lt;ref name="NISVS 2010" /&gt; Incidents of sexual violence in US are severely underreported, especially among male victims, that lead to an assumption that the actual number is likely higher.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;Sarah LeTrent. October 10, 2013. CNN, [http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/09/living/chris-brown-female-on-male-rape/ Against his will: Female-on-male rape].&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these numbers, the FBI reports that instances of rape have declined.&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/violent-crime/rape FBI. January 10, 2016. FBI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephanie Baird, a trauma recovery counselor, cited the "hot-for-teacher or babysitter complex" that is a popular motif in modern American culture. The culture makes it more difficult for a male adolescent to even recognize that he is being abused. She explained that ''consent'' means "being of age, mind, sound body to make an informed decision about whether one would like to become sexually intimate with the other person", while children cannot consent.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The most recent UK government statistics estimated about 78,000 people in the UK have become rape or attempted rape victims, and about 9,000 are men.&lt;ref name=theo/&gt; Research suggests that the notoriously low report rate is particularly true among male victims. About 1,250 incidents of male-victim rape were reported to the police in 2011–2012.&lt;ref name=theo/&gt; In February 2014, the ministry of justice set aside £500,000 to provide counseling and support for sexually abused males.&lt;ref name=theo&gt;{{cite news|author=Theo Merz|date=24 February 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/10657485/Men-and-boys-get-raped-too.html|title=Men and boys get raped too}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 in the UK, [[Joyce McKinney]] was sentenced to 12 months in prison for forcing a man to have sex with her while chained up.

===China===
The rape of males over the age of 14 is not a criminal offence in the People's Republic of China (though a November 2015 revision of the law provided that these acts could be prosecuted under the lesser offence of "forcible indecency").&lt;ref name="China Law Translate"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://chinalawtranslate.com/rape-of-men-is-still-not-a-crime-in-china/?lang=en|title= Rape of Men is (Still) Not a Crime in China|website=China Law Translate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, no official statistics are collected. However, the United Nations' 2013 ''Multi-Country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific'' found that 3% of Chinese men surveyed acknowledged having been raped by another man during their lifetime (suggesting that the proportion of male rapes as a percentage of all rapes was 14.4%).&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. "Multi-Country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific", [http://www.partners4prevention.org/sites/default/files/resources/china_quantitative_full_report.pdf United Nations Population Fund. Research on Gender-Based Violence and Masculinities in China: Quantitative Findings].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
According to research by the [[University of Hong Kong]] and UBS Optimus Foundation, sexual assault rates of boys are 2.7% higher than girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/822737.shtml|title=Reality of male rape needs legal recognition|website=[[Global Times]]|publisher=[[People's Daily]]|last=Caifeng|first=Xie|date=2013-11-05|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
Taiwan counted 12,066 victims of reported sexual assault in 2012 of which 1,335 victims were men. The Ministry of Interior showed that 7,608 minors were rape or sexual assault victims, with 1,063 of them being boys. To prevent the increasing number of these crimes, [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Taiwan's Ministry of Education]] had released a short film on sexual education. The netizens (Internet users) and students of [[Taiwan]] are treating it as a subject of jokes.&lt;ref&gt;Lin Chih-cheng. 17 July 2013. Want China Times, [http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20130717000008&amp;cid=1303 Sex assault education video becomes pop culture in Taiwan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423055204/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20130717000008&amp;cid=1303 |date=2014-04-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, National Academy of Educational Research Secretary-General Kuo Kung-pin stated that the video has achieved its purpose to get attention from the youth to remind them that men can be raped as well.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Canave.

===India===
The rape of males in India is commonly reported. For this reason, some activists and research organizations, including Jai Vipra at the New Delhi think-tank [[Centre for Civil Society]], argue that the phrasing of rape laws should be gender neutral.&lt;ref name=jai&gt;Jai Vipra. July 2013. CCS working Paper #286, [http://ccsinternship.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/286_case-for-gender-neutral-rape-laws-in-india_jaai-vipra.pdf A Case for Gender-Neutral Rape Laws in India].&lt;/ref&gt; This view is opposed by some human rights advocates and women's rights activists. Mumbai-based human rights lawyer Flavia Agnes told the ''India Times'', "I oppose proposal [sic] to make rape laws gender-neutral. We had opposed it when the government made child rape laws gender-neutral ... If made gender-neutral, rape laws will not have the deterrence value and it will make it more complicated for judges in court." International human rights lawyer and activist [[Vrinda Grover]] was quoted in the same article: "There are no instances of women raping men. I don't think men are facing serious sexual violence as [sic] women. Consider the brutality and intensity of sexual violence against women."&lt;ref name=tnn&gt;TNN. Jul 20, 2012.

===Indonesia===
The news about rape of males in Indonesia arouses astonishment or jokes.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Compares with these headlines: "This man is fell helpless against five rapist women"[http://www.tribunnews.com/internasional/2013/07/11/pria-ini-tak-berdaya-diperkosa-lima-wanita], "Duh!

According to the Secretary General of KPAI, Erlinda, "the majority of children who are victims of sexual violence are males, because boys are vulnerable to become the victims of sexual offenders because they are easily persuaded by the perpetrators who are pedophiles.&lt;ref&gt;Suara Pembaruan.

==National laws==
{{see also|Laws regarding rape}}

===United States===
The FBI's Uniform Crime Report in 2012 redefined rape as: "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." The prior definition had not changed since 1927 and gained the attention of sexual assault awareness groups because it had alienated the victims who did not fit the definition – "the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will".&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; The former definition of "forcible rape" focused on [[vagina]]l penetration, but the newer definition includes forcible [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[Oral sex|oral]] penetration. The old definition, "the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will", did not include forcible oral or anal penetration, the rape of women with other objects, or the rape of a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/politics/federal-crime-statistics-to-expand-rape-definition.html|title=U.S. to Expand Its Definition of Rape in Statistics|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2014-02-10|first=Charlie|last=Savage|date=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new definition encourages male rape victims to seek the help they need and also includes sexual assaults that previously were not covered by the definition of rape. The basis for changing this definition lies in the statistics provided by governmental institutions such as the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] and the CDC. A study done by the CDC found that 1 in 71 men had been raped or had been the target of attempted rape. This study included oral and anal penetration in its definition and did not include men in prison.&lt;ref name="Rabin"/&gt; Gender-neutral laws have combated the perception that rape rarely occurs to men,&lt;ref name=LaFave&gt;''Rape – Overview; Act and Mental State'', Wayne R. LaFave Professor of Law, University of Illinois, "Substantive Criminal Law" 752-756 (3d ed. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and other laws have eliminated the term ''rape'' altogether.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See, for example, Michigan Statutes for the first degree felony, section 520b: "(1) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree if he or she engages in sexual penetration of another person."&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Previously, English law did not include rape of males as a criminal offense and it was recorded as non-consensual [[buggery]]. A convicted rapist (of a female) could be imprisoned for life, stated Henry Leak, the chairman of Survivors organization, while buggery only carried 10 years maximum as a sentence.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt; This is however no longer the case; the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] s.&amp;nbsp;142 was the first to lead this development and recognize male-victim rape; and the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] states that penetration of the "mouth, anus or vagina with [the defendant's] penis" is sufficient for rape at s.&amp;nbsp;1(1)(a). ''R v Ismail'' [2005] All ER 216 further prevented distinction between "mouth, anus or vagina" when sentencing. Under the [[Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009]] and the [[Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008]] men can be both perpetrators and victims. However, in neither [[England and Wales]], [[Scotland]] or [[Northern Ireland]] can a female be legally charged with 'rape' (she must be instead charged with other offenses such as sexual assault, assault by penetration, or causing sexual activity without consent, of which the latter two carry the same maximum sentence).&lt;!-- Hypothetically possible for trans woman to rape, but need sources for this. --&gt;

===China===
Before 2015, article 236 of the revised Criminal Law of China specifies that the crime of rape may be committed only against women. It protects women's right to sexual autonomy but not men's.&lt;ref name=xie&gt;Xie Caifeng, a staff member with Shunyi District People's Court, [[Beijing]]. 5 November 2013.

The guidelines of [[China]] on child protection strengthen the punishments for sexual offenses against underage girls, but don't offer equal protection to underage boys. Molestation of both sexes is treated equally at present, but the rapists of boys can only be charged with [[child molestation]] with 5 years in prison as a maximum sentence. In September 2013, 27 NGOs called for the law to give equal protection to boys below 18 years old in cases of sexual offences.&lt;ref name=xie/&gt;

Until November 1, 2015, sexual offences against males above the age of 14 could not be prosecuted unless they also included a physical assault, in which case only the physical component was punishable. However, a revision of Article 237, which criminalises "forcible indecency," made that section of the law gender-neutral. Offences that constitute rape of males may be tried under this article, with offenders facing a maximum of five years in prison.&lt;ref name="China Law Translate"/&gt;

===India===
[[Penal Code of India#Reforms|The Indian Penal Code, Section 377]], is the only section that criminalizes all acts of nonconsensual carnal intercourse,&lt;ref name=legal&gt;Meghna. 13 May 2010. [http://www.legaldrift.com/male-rapes-some-myths-statistics-true-incidents-and-legal-insight/ Male Rapes – Some Myths, Statistics, True Incidents and Legal Insight].&lt;/ref&gt; including male-on-male rape.&lt;ref name=jai/&gt;
{{quote|Unnatural offences: Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation: Penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the offense described in this section.}}
This section penalizes both consensual and forced [[sodomy]]{{clarify|date=May 2018|reason=The term "sodomy" is used repeatedly in the source, but not defined. From context, though, it can be inferred to refer to interhuman activities.}} with 10 years minimum to life imprisonment. The Delhi HC stated that Section 377 of Indian Penal Code will continue to govern non-consensual penile, non-vaginal sex and penile non-vaginal sex involving minors. The section can be evoked to punish sodomites, pedophiles and zoophiles.&lt;ref name=legal/&gt;

The rape definition in Section 375 of Indian Penal Code does not include rape in which males are the victims. The Indian government (2012) decided to change the definition of "rape" as forcible penetration to include male victims, but was criticized on the grounds that this would further harm the interests of female rape victims.&lt;ref name=legal/&gt;&lt;ref name=kumar&gt;Mahendra Kumar Singh and Vishwa Mohan (July 19, 2012). [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Government-looks-to-make-rape-laws-gender-neutral/articleshow/15035841.cms "Government looks to make rape laws gender-neutral"]. ''[[The Times of India]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013 Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, rape and sexual harassment crimes were gender neutral. The term "rape" was removed and substituted with "sexual assault". But strong objections were raised by feminist groups that made the Indian government decided to restore the term "rape" and state that only men can be the rapists of women.&lt;ref name=jai/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nagendar Sharma (March 5, 2013).

===Indonesia===
Based on ''Kitab Undang-undang Hukum Pidana'' (Indonesian's Penal Code), males cannot be the victims of rape.&lt;ref name=koesnadi&gt;Koesnadi. 1992. "Seksualitas dan Alat Kontrasepsi". Surabaya: Usaha Nasional. {{id}}&lt;/ref&gt; In paragraph 285, rape is defined as a sexual violence against a female having a sentence of imprisonment for a maximum of 12 years, while in paragraph 289, the victim of "vulgar actions" is not defined as male or female and the punishment is a maximum of 9 years imprisonment.&lt;ref name=kuhp&gt;[http://www.tribunais.tl/files/Codigo_Penal_Indonesio_%28Bahasa_Indonesia%29.pdf Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Pidana (KUHP)]. {{id}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commentary on paragraph 285 by R. Soesilo stated that the law makers didn't need to determine the punishment for a female perpetrator that forced males to have intercourse with her. This is not because such action is not possible, but the act is deemed to not do harm or result in something bad to male victims, such as pregnancy in females.&lt;ref name=soesilo&gt;R. Soesilo. 1996. "Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Pidana Serta Komentar-Komentarnya Lengkap Pasal Demi Pasal". Bogor: Politea. {{id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
Prior to the 1997 amendment of [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines|Revised Penal Code]] of 1930, male victims of rape were not acknowledged under Philippine law. Article 266-A of the law defines rape by "an act of sexual assault" by any person either by "inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice" or inserting "any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person".The 1997 amendment allowed the legal recognition of rape of males, both by other males and by females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Acosta|first1=Persida|title=Men and women can now both cry rape|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/men-and-women-can-now-both-cry-rape/191826/|accessdate=15 March 2018|work=The Manila Times|date=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
{{see also|Penal Code (Singapore)}}
Male victims of rape are not acknowledged in Singapore law. A male rape victim is not considered a rape victim under S375(1) of Penal Code, which defines rape as the act of a man penetrating a woman's vagina with his penis without her consent. Penetration of other body orifices is not rape but an unlawful sexual penetration (S376(1), Penal Code). Both crimes carry the same penalty: imprisonment for a term of up to 20 years plus fine or caning. (S375(2) and S376(4), Penal Code).&lt;ref&gt;AWARE, Association of Women for Action and Research.

'''Cheng Chui Ping''' ({{zh|t=鄭翠萍 |s=郑翠萍 |p=Zhèng Cuìpíng |w=Cheng Ts'ui-p'ing}}), also known as '''Sister Ping''' (萍姐 Píng Jiě; January 9, 1949 &amp;ndash; April 24, 2014), ran a successful [[human smuggling]] operation between [[Hong Kong]] and [[New York City]] from 1984 until 2000.  She was arrested in [[Hong Kong]] in 2000 and extradited back to the [[United States]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=nyt35yrs&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/17/nyregion/17ping.html |work=The New York Times | title=Ringleader Gets 35-Year Term in Smuggling of Immigrants | first=Julia | last=Preston | date=2006-03-17 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was held in U.S. Federal prison until her death in 2014. Nicknamed "The Mother of All Snakeheads", a translation of the Chinese word for "smuggler," her legacy is debated, with many Chinese immigrants in New York praising her actions and her generosity toward her fellow Chinese in the United States.

==Early life==
Ping was born January 9th, 1949 in the poor farming village of [[Shengmei]], [[Fuzhou]] ("Prospering Beauty") in northern [[Fujian]] province, [[China]]. Ping's father, Cheng Chai Leung, who was from Shengmei, and mother, who was from a neighboring village, had five children in all.&lt;ref name=thesnakehead&gt;{{cite book|last=Keefe|first=Patrick Radden|title=The Snakehead: An Epic Tale of the Chinatown Underworld and the American Dream|year=2009|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=978-0385521307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ping was 10 months old when [[Mao Zedong]] established the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref name=thesnakehead/&gt; She attended the village elementary school as a child and worked on the family farm, helping raise pigs and rabbits, chopping wood, and tending a vegetable garden. According to Ping's biographer, Patrick Radden Keefe, who interviewed her in 2008, Ping said that as a girl of twelve years old she survived the capsizing of a rowboat in which she had been traveling to another village to cut wood for kindling. She recalled of the incident that all of the people in the boat who had been rowing and had been holding an oar when the boat turned over managed to survive, while "the two people who were lazy and sat back while others worked ended up dead. This taught me to work hard."&lt;ref name=thesnakehead/&gt; Ping also said that during the [[Cultural Revolution]], she became a leader of the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] in her village.&lt;ref name=thesnakehead/&gt;

When she was fifteen, her father left the family and traveled to the United States as a [[merchant marine]] crewman. He stayed in the U.S. for thirteen years, working as a dish-washer and sending money home to the family every few months. He was apprehended by U.S. immigration authorities and deported back to China in 1977. When he returned to China, Ping's father entered into the business of [[people smuggling]].&lt;ref name=thesnakehead/&gt;

Sister Ping married a man from a neighboring village, Cheung Yick Tak, in 1969.&lt;ref name=thesnakehead/&gt; They had a daughter, Cheung "Monica" Hui Mui, in 1973;&lt;ref name=thesnakehead/&gt; Ping later had three sons.&lt;ref name=died/&gt; The family moved to Hong Kong in 1974, where Ping became a successful businesswoman and opened a factory in Shenzhen, China.&lt;ref name=thesnakehead /&gt; In  June 1981, with the help from an elderly couple, Ping successfully applied to be a nanny in New York&lt;ref name=queen&gt;{{cite news |title=Stolen Queen. |url=https://www.toutiaoabc.com/index.php?act=view&amp;nid=357037 |publisher=6park.com |date=July 24, 2017 |accessdate=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the family passed through Canada,&lt;ref name=bbc-mother-of&gt;{{cite news |title=Cheng Chui Ping: 'Mother of Snakeheads' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4816354.stm |newspaper=BBC |date=March 17, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112114102/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4816354.stm |archivedate=November 12, 2012 |accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 17 November 1981, they settled in [[Chinatown, Manhattan]], in the United States, where they opened a shop, the Tak Shun Variety Store, which catered to homesick [[Fuzhounese Americans|Fuzhounese immigrants]].&lt;ref name=thesnakehead/&gt; During her time in New York, Ping lived at 14 Monroe Street, [[Knickerbocker Village]], a modest lower middle class development.&lt;ref name=map&gt;{{cite news |title=Where the Snakehead Slithered|url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/58055/ |publisher=New York Media LLC |date=July 26, 2009|accessdate=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smuggling business==

===Early career===
Sister Ping began her smuggling career in the early 1980s as a one-woman operation, smuggling handfuls of fellow villagers from China into the United States a few at a time by [[commercial airline]] using [[forged identification documents]].&lt;ref name=DOJ-PR /&gt; She charged $35,000 or more to transport interested immigrants into the United States.&lt;ref name="nyt35yrs" /&gt;

In the spring of 1989, evidence against Sister Peng was gathered in sting by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at Toronto International Airport. Several months later, Ping was arrested and pleaded guilty to alien smuggling. She was sentenced to six months in prison in Butler County, Pennsylvania. As she spoke little English, she was isolated from other prisoners and readily agreed to provide a Chinese-speaking FBI agent with information on Chinatown's underworld, she received a reduced sentence and served four months.&lt;ref name="Snakehead"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/04/24/the-snakehead |title=The Snakehead|last=Keefe|first=Patrick Radden|date=April 24, 2006 |newspaper=The New Yorker |location=New York, New York |publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business picked up after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] when the U.S. government offered Chinese students present in the United States at the time the opportunity to stay. Thousands flooded into the country from abroad using false papers to establish a claim to residency under the new rule.&lt;ref name=bbc-mother-of /&gt;

===Mass operations by cargo ship===
On June 6, 1993 the [[Golden_Venture|Golden Venture]] ship ran aground in Queens, New York with 286 illegal immigrants onboard. One of the criminal leaders, Guo Liang Chi, named Ping as an investor. In December 1994, an indictment was brought before a Manhattan federal court, stating that Ping had smuggled around 3,000 Fujianese to the United States since 1984 with the help of the American-Chinese gang Fuk Ching&lt;ref name="'Big Sister Ping' closer to US trial as extradition appeal rejected"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scmp.com/article/386892/big-sister-ping-closer-us-trial-extradition-appeal-rejected |title='Big Sister Ping' closer to US trial as extradition appeal rejected|last=Bradford|first=Sarah|date=August 1, 2002 |newspaper=South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong|publisher=South China Morning Post |accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Sometimes hundreds of people were smuggled in at a time via [[cargo ship]] and imprisoned below deck for months at a time with little food and water. In 1998, one of the smaller boats Sister Ping used for offloading customers from a larger vessel capsized off the coast of Guatemala, drowning fourteen.&lt;ref name=DOJ-PR /&gt;&lt;ref name=Snakehead/&gt;

===International network and collections===
Sister Ping hired scores of people in several different countries to move her human cargo for her, hold them hostage until their smuggling fees were paid, and collect those fees from them. Sometimes her customers were lucky and arrived safely in the United States where they paid the exorbitant fees Sister Ping charged, and were released.&lt;ref name=DOJ-PR /&gt;

To ensure her customers paid their smuggling fees, Sister Ping hired armed thugs from the [[Fuk Ching]],&lt;ref name=NJI-FukChing&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/218463.pdf?q=ching |title=Chinese Transnational Organized Crime: The Fuk Ching |last1=Finckenauer |first1=James O. |date=December 6, 2007 |website=[[National Institute of Justice]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Criminal Justice Reference Service |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913120912/http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/218463.pdf |archivedate=September 13, 2008 |accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinatown’s most vicious and feared gang, to transport and guard her customers in the United States. The presence of these gang members guaranteed that Sister Ping got paid the $25,000 to $45,000 fee she demanded for the trip.&lt;ref name=DOJ-PR /&gt;

Sister Ping also ran a money transmitting business out of her Chinatown variety store.&lt;ref name=DOJ-PR /&gt;

===Scope and notoriety===

Individuals who conducted such Chinese alien smuggling operations are known as "[[Snakehead (gang)|snakeheads]]" from the Chinese translation for human-smuggler. Almost all of the immigrants whom Sister Ping harbored came from Fujian province. She was renowned as the most notorious snakehead, operating the largest, most sophisticated operation of its kind, which became international in scale.  The U.S. Department of Justice declared at her sentencing that "Sister Ping is one of the first, and ultimately most successful, alien smugglers of all time."&lt;ref name=DOJ-PR /&gt; It is estimated that Ping amassed around $40 million.&lt;ref name=journey&gt;{{cite web |url=https://citylimits.org/2003/12/15/journey-to-the-golden-mountain/ |title=Journey to the Golden Mountain |last=Zimmer |first=Amy|date=December 15, 2003 |website=City Limits |location=New York, New York |accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal pursuit===
In 1994, Sister Ping was invited to Beijing, China along with other overseas notables of Fujianese descent to celebrate an anniversary celebration of the [[Communist_Party_of_China|Communist Party]]. She was arrested when she arrived but according to police and friends, she paid bribes to escape custody. Later in December 1994, Ping learned of the US indictment and she fled, returning to China where she continued her business&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,50610-2,00.html |title=Two-Faced Woman |last=Barnes |first=Edward |date=July 23, 2000 |newspaper=Time|location=New York, New York |publisher=Time |accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [[FBI]] and [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]] spent the following five years attempting to apprehend her, but she was believed to reside mainly in China, which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. On April 17, 2000 [[Interpol]] searched passenger lists for flights from Hong Kong to New York, they found her son's name. More than 40 agents from the Hong Kong narcotics bureau waited at the airport, apprehended her at around noon and she was fingerprinted and arrested.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; At the time Ping was carrying three passports, including a fake Belize one with her photo but in the name of Lilly Zheng.&lt;ref name=Snakehead /&gt; She fought extradition but was eventually sent back to New York in July 2003 and  held at Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn&lt;ref name=journey /&gt;&lt;ref name="fbi"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2006/march/sisterping_031706 |title=The Case of the Snakehead Queen |date=March 17, 2006 |publisher=FBI |accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Radden Keefe, "[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/04/24/060424fa_fact6%20 The Snakehead: The Criminal Odyssey of Chinatown's Sister Ping]," The New Yorker, April 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

After a jury trial before the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] she was convicted in June 2005 on three separate counts, including one count of conspiring to commit alien smuggling, hostage taking, [[money laundering]] and trafficking in [[ransom]] proceeds and sentenced to 35 years in prison.&lt;ref name=DOJ-PR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/March06/sisterpingsentencingpr.pdf |title=Sister Ping Sentenced To 35 Years In Prison For Alien Smuggling, Hostage Taking, Money Laundering And Ransom Proceeds Conspiracy |last1=Hadad |first1=Herbert |last2=Gaffney |first2=Megan |last3=Tasker |first3=Heather |last4=Kelly |first4=Bridget |date=March 16, 2006 |website=[[U.S. Department of Justice]] |location=New York, New York |publisher=United States Attorney Southern District of New York |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428050754/http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/March06/sisterpingsentencingpr.pdf |archivedate=April 28, 2014 |accessdate=April 24, 2014 |quote=CHENG CHUI PING, a/k/a "Sister Ping," was sentenced today to 35 years in prison for her role in leading an international alien smuggling ring.

Ping was interviewed in Danbury in June 2013 and said, “Being locked up for over 10 years allowed me to think about my previous life, my heart calmed down and I started to feel that jail was the safest place for me. I keep telling myself not to think much about the future and live life by the moment." She also said "I cannot believe they jailed me for 35 years! 35 years! In a way I was killed by the FBI agents and tainted witnesses.".&lt;ref name="sino"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sino-us.com/290/Sister-Ping-A-snakehead-with-a-kind-heart.html |title=Sister Ping: A ‘snakehead’ with a kind heart |last=Li |first=Hong |date=June 14, 2013 |website=Sino-US|location=Beijing, China |publisher=Rhythm Media Group |accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sister Ping served part of her [[sentence (law)|sentence]] in [[Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury|Federal prison in Danbury]], Connecticut (BOP #05117-055). In 2013, it was announced that Danbury would be reverted to a male-only facility and Ping was transferred to FMC Carswell, Texas in April 2014. On arrival, she was diagnosed with [[pancreatic_cancer|pancreatic cancer]].&lt;ref name="died"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mitbbs.ca/mwap/forum/article.php?board=Fujian&amp;groupid=31260717&amp;content_type=all |title=Stolen Emperor Ping Sister died sixty-five years old|date=April 26, 2014 |publisher=World Journal |accessdate=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Stephen Edward De Vere, 4th Baronet''' (26 July 1812 &amp;ndash; 10 November 1904) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Member of Parliament]] in the nineteenth century.
 
==Life==
He was the second son of [[Sir Aubrey de Vere, 2nd Baronet]] and Mary Spring Rice, and elder brother of the poet [[Aubrey Thomas de Vere]]. He had three sisters, although only one, Elinor, survived until adulthood. De Vere's other siblings were; Horatio, William and Vere Edmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Abiding Enchantment of Curragh Chase|last = Wynne Jones|first = Joan|publisher = |year = 1998|isbn = |location = Cork|pages = 3–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1847, he took passage in one of the infamous "[[coffin ship]]s" that transported Irish emigrants fleeing the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]] to [[British North America]] and the [[United States]], wanting to see for himself the horrendous conditions that were leading to the deaths of so many of these passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/stephen%20de%20vere's%20voyage.pdf |title=Stephen de Vere's Voyage to Canada, 1847 |author=P.F. Meghen |publisher=[[Limerick City and County Council]] |work=Thomond Archaeological Society (original), The Old Limerick Journal (reprint) |date=1967 |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He composed a withering report on his voyage now known as ''The Elgin-Grey Papers''. When Colonial Secretary [[Earl Grey]] read this report, he forwarded it to [[Lord Elgin]], [[Governor-General]] of [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]] in the hope that these inhumane conditions could be improved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/immigrants/021017-2113.03-e.html Moving Here, Staying Here: The Canadian Immigrant Experience] at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;  The Passenger Act of 1847 made "coffin ships" illegal, though many still operated.&lt;ref name=CityHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/Media,4205,en.pdf |title=Sir Stephen Edward de Vere, Poet/Politician, 1812-1904 |publisher=[[Limerick City and County Council]] |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.ca/immigrants/021017-2111-e.html |title=Moving Here, Staying Here: The Canadian Immigrant Experience – "Right of Passage" |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |work=collectionscanada.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
De Vere became a [[Roman Catholic]] in 1847, and defended the re-creation of the English Catholic hierarchy in 1851.&lt;ref name=CityHistory/&gt; He was a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] MP for [[Limerick County (UK Parliament constituency)|Limerick County]] from 1854 to 1859, and was appointed [[High Sheriff of County Limerick]] in 1870.

Stephen Edward became 4th [[De Vere baronets|Baronet of Curragh]] in 1880 when his oldest brother, Vere Edmond, 3rd Baronet, died with no male heir.  The Hunt/de Vere family estate for 300 years (1657–1957), including the period of the Baronetcy of Curragh, is the present day [[Curraghchase Forest Park]], in [[County Limerick]]. Before becoming the 4th Baronet, Stephen had built a smaller house in the 1850s on Foynes Island in the [[River Shannon]], adjacent to the port town of [[Foynes]], less than {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Curraghchase.  There he wrote poems, political pamphlets and translated several editions of the works of [[Horace]], considered by some as the best English translation of Horace's verses.&lt;ref name=CityHistory/&gt;

He built a Gothic church in Foynes, and is buried beside it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB12|wstitle=De Vere, Stephen Edward |first=Elizabeth|last= Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his death in 1904 the baronetcy became extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|author=Elizabeth Lee, Rev. M. C. Curthoys,|id=32798 |title=Vere, Sir Stephen Edward De, fourth baronet (1812–1904) }}&lt;/ref&gt; He never married and his estate, together with that of his unmarried brother Aubrey, went to their nephew Aubrey Vere O'Brien, while the Foynes Island farm went to their other nephew, Robert Vere O'Brien.

'''Wilhelm Walter Friedrich Kempff''' (25 November 1895 – 23 May 1991) was a German pianist and composer. Although his repertoire included [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], Kempff was particularly well known for his interpretations of the music of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]], recording the complete sonatas of both composers.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Wilhelm Kempff Is Dead at 95|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 May 1991|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/25/arts/wilhelm-kempff-is-dead-at-95-german-was-romantic-pianist.html|accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schubert, ''Complete Piano Sonatas'', 9-LP set Deutsche Grammophon 1976, one of a number of boxed sets issued under the title ''Hommage à Wilhelm Kempff'' to celebrate his fifty years of recording for the DG label.

''Great Pianists of Our Time''. New York: Herder and Herder. {{OCLC|235884}}. An entire chapter is devoted to Kempff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kempff was born in [[Jüterbog]], [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], in 1895.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; He grew up in nearby [[Potsdam]] where his father was a royal music director and organist at St. Nicolai Church. His grandfather was also an organist and his brother Georg became director of church music at the [[University of Erlangen]]. Kempff studied music at first at the Berlin Hochschule für Musik at the age of nine after receiving lessons from his father at a younger age. Whilst there he studied composition with [[Robert Kahn (composer)|Robert Kahn]] and piano with [[Karl Heinrich Barth]]&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; (with whom [[Arthur Rubinstein]] also studied). In 1914 Kempff moved on to study at the Viktoria gymnasium in Potsdam before returning to Berlin to finish his training.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

==As a pianist==
In 1917, Kempff gave his first major recital, consisting of predominantly major works, including Beethoven's [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|Hammerklavier Sonata]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] [[Paganini Variations (Brahms)|Variations on a theme of Paganini]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Kempff toured widely in Europe and much of the rest of the world. Between 1936 and 1979 he performed ten times in Japan (a small Japanese island was named ''Kenpu-san'' in his honor){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. Kempff made his first London appearance in 1951 and his first in New York in 1964. He gave his last public performance in Paris in 1981, and then retired for health reasons ([[Parkinson's Disease]]){{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. He died in [[Positano]], Italy, in 1991 at the age of 95, five years after his wife, whom he had married in 1926. They were survived by seven children.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

Wilhelm Kempff recorded over a period of some sixty years. His recorded legacy includes works of [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], Brahms, [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] and particularly, of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

[[File:Ernest Ansermet and Wilhelm Kempff (1965) by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|Kempff (right) with [[Ernest Ansermet]] (left) in 1965]]
He was the first to record the complete [[piano sonata|sonatas]] of Franz Schubert, long before these works became popular.  (For Schubert sonatas which were left incomplete, Kempff recorded only the completed movements and not the fragments.) He also recorded two sets of the complete Beethoven sonatas (and one early, almost complete set on [[shellac]] (1926–1945), one in mono (1951–1956) and the other in stereo (1964–1965). He recorded the complete Beethoven [[piano concerto]]s twice as well, both with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]]; the first from the early 1950s in mono with [[Paul van Kempen]], and the later in stereo from the early 1960s with [[Ferdinand Leitner]]. Kempff also recorded [[chamber music]] with [[Yehudi Menuhin]], [[Pierre Fournier]], [[Wolfgang Schneiderhan (violinist)|Wolfgang Schneiderhan]], [[Paul Grummer]], and [[Henryk Szeryng]], among others.

He left recordings of most of his repertory, including the complete sonatas of Beethoven and Schubert. He performed to an advanced age, continuing to give concerts past his eightieth birthday. His association with the Berlin Philharmonic spanned over sixty years.

===Technique and style===
As a performer Kempff stressed lyricism and spontaneity in music, particularly effective in intimate pieces or passages. He always strove for a singing, lyrical quality. He avoided extreme tempos and display for its own sake.

The pianist [[Alfred Brendel]] has written that Kempff "played on impulse... it depended on whether the right breeze, as with an aeolian harp, was blowing. You then would take something home that you never heard elsewhere." (in Brendel's book, ''The Veil of Order''). He regards Kempff as the "most rhythmical" of his colleagues. Brendel helped choose the selections for Phillip's "Great Pianists of the 20th Century" issue of Kempff recordings, and wrote in the notes that Kempff "achieves things that are beyond him" in his "unsurpassable" recording of Liszt's first Legende, "St. Francis Preaching to the Birds."

When pianist [[Artur Schnabel]] undertook his pioneering complete recording of the Beethoven sonatas in the 1930s, he told EMI that if he didn't complete the cycle, they should have Kempff complete the remainder – even though the two pianists took noticeably different approaches to the composer (for example, Schnabel preferred extremely fast or slow tempos, while Kempff preferred moderate ones). Later, when Kempff was in [[Finland]], the composer [[Jean Sibelius]] asked him to play the slow movement of Beethoven's 29th Sonata, the [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|Hammerklavier]]; after Kempff finished, Sibelius told him, "You did not play that as a pianist but rather as a human being."&lt;ref&gt;Complete Beethoven Sonatas sleevenotes &lt;nowiki&gt;{{which}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a teacher==
From 1924 to 1929, Kempff took over the direction of the [[State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart|Stuttgart College of Music]] as a successor of Max Pauer. In 1931, he was co-founder of the summer courses at Marmorpalais Potsdam. In 1957, Kempff founded Fondazione Orfeo (today: Kempff Kulturstiftung) in the south-Italian city [[Positano]] and held his first Beethoven interpretation masterclass at Casa Orfeo, which Kempff had built especially for this reason. He continued teaching there once a year until 1982. His wife died in 1986. After his death in 1991, [[Gerhard Oppitz]] taught the courses from 1992–1995, followed by [[John O'Conor|John O’Conor]] until 2011 and from 2013 onwards Bernd Goetzke. Oppitz and O'Conor had both been outstanding participants of Kempff's masterclasses and were personally closely connected with Wilhelm Kempff. Like his predecessors Bernd Goetzke is a former participant of the courses in Positano.

Other noted pianists to have studied with Kempff include [[Jörg Demus]], [[Norman Shetler]], [[Mitsuko Uchida]], [[Peter Schmalfuss]], [[Idil Biret]] and [[Ventsislav Yankov]].&lt;ref&gt;''88 notes pour piano solo'', [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]], Neva Ed., 2015, p. 340. {{ISBN|978 2 3505 5192 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
A lesser-known activity of Kempff was composing. He composed for almost every genre and used his own cadenzas for Beethoven's Piano Concertos 1–4. His student [[Idil Biret]] has recorded a CD of his piano works. His second symphony premiered in 1929 at the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra|Leipzig Gewandhaus]] by [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]]. He also prepared a number of Bach transcriptions, including the [[Siciliano]] from the [[Sonata in E-flat major for flute or recorder and harpsichord|Flute Sonata in E-flat major]], that have been recorded by Kempff and others. His opera ''Famile Gozzi'', a comic work in three acts, was written in 1934.
