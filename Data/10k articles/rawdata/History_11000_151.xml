He taught at the [[University of Melbourne]] and the [[University of Sydney]], and was Professor of History at [[Monash University]] from 1964 until his retirement in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinity.unimelb.edu.au/about/news--media/news/trinity-remembers-agl-shaw.html |title=Trinity Remembers AGL Shaw|publisher=Trinity.unimelb.edu.au |date=5 April 2012 |accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Shaw was born in Melbourne on 3 February 1916 to George Shaw, a solicitor, and his wife Ethel née Lewers. Shaw was educated at [[Melbourne Grammar School]] where he was on the debating team, played violin in the orchestra and was awarded the Frank Grey Smith Scholarship for Classics or Modern Languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dbtw.mgs.vic.edu.au/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?AC=GET_RECORD&amp;XC=/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll&amp;BU=http%3A%2F%2Fdbtw.mgs.vic.edu.au%2Fdbtw-wpd%2Ftextbase%2Fcll_archives.htm&amp;TN=Melbourne+Grammar&amp;SN=AUTO14798&amp;SE=564&amp;RN=0&amp;MR=20&amp;TR=0&amp;TX=1000&amp;ES=0&amp;CS=1&amp;XP=&amp;RF=xeditshort&amp;EF=Basic+Record+Form&amp;DF=Web%3EDisplay&amp;RL=0&amp;EL=0&amp;DL=0&amp;NP=3&amp;ID=&amp;MF=&amp;MQ=&amp;TI=0&amp;DT=&amp;ST=0&amp;IR=519&amp;NR=0&amp;NB=0&amp;SV=0&amp;SS=1&amp;BG=&amp;FG=&amp;QS=cll_archives&amp;OEX=ISO-8859-1&amp;OEH=ISO-8859-1 Melbourne Grammar School archives]&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[Trinity College (University of Melbourne)|Trinity College]] at the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1935,&lt;ref&gt;Salvete list, ''Fleur-de-Lys'' magazine, Trinity College, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; where he was President of the Dialectic Society in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;''Fleur-de-Lys'' magazine, Trinity College, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating BA with first class honours in History and Political Science,&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of the University of Melbourne'', 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw tutored at Trinity College before leaving for further study at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], graduating BA (later MA) with a First in the Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) program in 1940. While there, he was a member of the [[Oxford Union]] Society and the [[Oxford University Music Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Archives, Christ Church, University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Shaw returned to Australia in 1940, working for the Federal [[Department of Information (Australia)|Departments of Information]], Army and Post-War Reconstruction. From 1941, alongside these government positions, Shaw returned to Melbourne University as part-time Lecturer in Economic History and Tutor at Trinity College. During 1944 Shaw was appointed as joint Acting Dean of Trinity College, and as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Minutes, Trinity College Council, May 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw was Captain of the squash team, and Vice-President of the Dialectic Society at Trinity from 1941 to 1950.&lt;ref&gt;James Grant, ''Perspectives of a Century'' (Melbourne: Trinity College, 1972) 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, Shaw became Lecturer in Modern History. He was associate editor of the journal ''Historical Studies'' (now ''[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/1031461X.asp Australian Historical Studies]'') from 1949 to 1951, and was a member of its editorial board. In 1950 he was awarded a Nuffield Dominion Travelling Fellowship and spent a year undertaking research in England into Australia's convict period.

On his return to Australia in 1952, Shaw became Senior Lecturer in History at the [[University of Sydney]], and from 1953 to 1956 was Sub-Warden at [[St Paul's College, University of Sydney|St Paul's College]]. He was the inaugural President of the [http://www.htansw.asn.au/ History Teachers’ Association of New South Wales] from 1960 to 1964, and was co-editor of its journal, ''Teaching History''. While in Sydney, he served on the Council of the [[Royal Australian Historical Society]], and was editor of their journal. 

In the early 1960s he was called upon to adjudicate on the long-running Australian TV quiz show ''[[Pick A Box]]'' when contestant [[Barry Jones (Australian politician)|Barry Jones]] disputed the answer given to the question "Who was the first British Governor-General of India?"

Shaw returned to an academic position in Melbourne in 1964 as Professor of Modern History at [[Monash University]], only three years after teaching commenced there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adm.monash.edu.au/records-archives/archives/formerofficers/professors.html Monash University Archives].&lt;/ref&gt; He held this post until his retirement in 1981, at which time he was granted the status of Emeritus Professor. He served as a member of the Monash University Council from 1977 to 1979 and again from 1989 to 1991. He was general editor of the three-volume official history of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] published for the state's sesquicentenary in 1984. For the [[Australian Academy of the Humanities]] and the [[Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia]] he edited a series of lectures in celebration of the sesquicentenary, published as ''Victoria's Heritage'' (1986).

==Reputation and service==
A review of his ''History of the Port Phillip District'' (1996) thought it a "meticulously researched and carefully crafted work which Shaw's earlier writings have led us to expect."&lt;ref&gt;''Victorian Historical Journal'', vol. 68, no. 2, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer in ''Australian Historical Studies'' noted that Shaw handed his sources "judiciously, scrupulously and respectfully," and that "in another ninety-four years, men and women will still be turning to Shaw's work with faith and confidence".&lt;ref&gt;''Australian Historical Studies'', vol. 110 (1998), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 he was elected President of the Royal Historical Society of Victoria, and also served as a member of their Finance, Fellowship, Speakers and Editorial committees. Upon his resignation in 1991, the Society thanked him for the "benefit of his wise counsel, erudition, discernment and gentle humour,"&lt;ref&gt;''R.H.S.V. History News'', no. 120 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaw helped found the Friends of the La Trobe Library, now incorporated as the [http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/about-us/organisation-governance/foundation/ State Library Foundation],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/about-us/organisation-governance/foundation/ State Library Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; and was President of the [http://www.latrobesociety.org.au/ C.J. La Trobe Society]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latrobesociety.org.au/ C.J. La Trobe Society]&lt;/ref&gt; from 2002 to 2003. The [[State Library of Victoria]] recognised his contributions in the naming of its annual "AGL Shaw Summer Research Scholarships".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/agl-shaw AGL Shaw Summer Research Scholarships] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229114603/http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/agl-shaw |date=29 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RHSV and the La Trobe Society also conduct a joint annual [http://www.latrobesociety.org.au/LaTrobeanaAGLShaw.html A.G.L. Shaw lecture] in his honour.

He was a benefactor to [[Melbourne Opera]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melbourneopera.com/benefactors Benefactors List, Melbourne Opera]&lt;/ref&gt; and, due to his long association through art connections of his wife, Peggy Perrins Shaw (1917–2009), a major supporter and benefactor of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], creating the Shaw Research Library, now home to over 50,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/visit/navigate-ngv/frequently-asked-questions Shaw Library, NGV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505202633/http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/visit/navigate-ngv/frequently-asked-questions |date=5 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his retirement, he did not give up teaching altogether, presenting lectures for the [[University of the Third Age]] (U3A) for many years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1339">'''Abu'l-Fath''', or '''Ibn Abi al-Hasan al-Samiri al-Danafi''', was a fourteenth-century [[Samaritan]] chronicler, writing in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. His major work is ''Kitab al-Ta'rikh''.

The work was commissioned in 1352 by Pinḥas, Samaritan high priest, and begun in 1356. It is a compilation of Samaritan history from cited earlier sources,&lt;ref&gt;Alan David Crown, Reinhard Pummer, Abraham Tal, ''A Companion to Samaritan Studies'' (1993), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; running from [[Adam]] to [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13417a.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Samaritan Language and Literature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was edited by [[Eduard Vilmar]] as ''Abulfathi annales Samaritani'' ([[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], 1865).

'''Antiquization''' ([[Macedonian Language|Macedonian]]: антиквизација), sometimes also '''ancient Macedonism''' ([[Macedonian Language |Macedonian]]: антички македонизам), is a term used mainly to critically describe the [[Identity politics|identity policies]] conducted by the [[Macedonian nationalism|nationalist]] [[VMRO-DPMNE]]-led governments of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] in the period between 2006 and 2017. In the contemporary Macedonian discourse, antiquization refers to the identitarian policies based on the assumption that there is a direct link between today's [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonians]] and [[Ancient Macedonians]].&lt;ref name="Vangeli13"&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The recent politics of history therefore not only embrace the recollection of the alleged ancient heritage of the Ancient Macedonians, i.e. the heritage of [[Philip II of Macedon | Philip II]] and his son [[Alexander the Great]], but also seek to depict a coherent continuity of history from the ancient [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Kingdom of Macedon]] until the modern Republic of Macedonia in order to reveal the uniqueness of the modern Macedonians and their country. This continuous and supposedly linear historiography includes the assertion that the modern ethnic Macedonians are direct descendants of the Ancient Macedonians. The expression “antiquization” originates from the history of arts and describes "the Renaissance practice of giving a city the appearance of ancient Rome or Athens through the introduction of structures organized in the classical mode".&lt;ref&gt;Tzonis, Alexander; Lefaivre, Liane (1987): Das Klassische in der Architektur: die Poetik der Ordnung.

==Narrative referred to as 'antiquization'==
The narrative promoted by VMRO-DPMNE goes back to the ancient [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom) | Kingdom of Macedon]], continues with personalities from [[early Christianity]], distinguished historical figures who were born in or ruled in or around [[Skopje]] and also embraces a group of freedom fighters who struggled for Macedonian independence.&lt;ref name=Muhic141&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia.

In ancient times [[Philip II of Macedon]] was the first who united the [[Polis|Greek city-states]] and created the basis for the [[Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom)#Empire|great empire]] which, later on, was expanded by his son, Alexander III of Macedon, also known as [[Alexander the Great]]. Alexander's empire is regarded as being important for the spread of [[Hellenistic_period#Culture|Hellenistic culture]], arts and sciences in considerable parts of Europe, Asia and northern Africa. [[Ancient_Macedonians#Modern_discourse|Modern scholarly discourse has produced several hypotheses about the Macedonians' place within the Greek world]], about whether the [[Ancient Macedonians]] were [[Greeks]] and whether the [[Ancient Macedonian language]] was a form of the [[Greek language]] or related to it. In parts of the available ancient literature they are described as a [[List of ancient Greek tribes|Greek tribe]], in others the Ancient Macedonians were regarded as [[barbarian]]s by the Athenians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burn|first1=Andrew|title=Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Empire|date=1991|publisher=Ams Pr Inc|isbn=0404200486|page=4|quote=Macedonian kings were proud of their Greek blood, and it was only jaundiced opponents like Demosthenes the Athenian who ventured to call them 'barbarians.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Errington|first1=R. Malcolm|title=A History of Macedonia|date=1990|publisher=University of California Press|page=4|quote=Ancient allegations that the Macedonians were non-Greek all had their origin in Athens at the time of the struggle with Philip II. Then as now, political struggle created the prejudice. The orator Aeschines once even found it necessary, in order to counteract the prejudice vigorously fomented by his opponents, to defend Philip on this issue and describe him at a meeting of the Athenian Popular Assembly as being 'entirely Greek'. Demosthenes' allegations were lent an appearance of credibility by the fact, apparent to every observer, that the life-style of the Macedonians, being determined by specific geographical and historical conditions, was different from that of a Greek city-state. This alien way of life was, however, common to western Greeks of Epirus, Akarnania and Aitolia, as well as to the Macedonians, and their fundamental Greek nationality was never doubted. Only as a consequence of the political disagreement with Macedonia was the issue raised at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who were gradually [[Hellenization|Hellenized]].&lt;ref&gt;Papavizas, G. C. (2010): FYROM: Searching for a Name, and Problems with the Expropriation of History. In ''Mediterranean Quarterly'' 21 (3), pp. 86–103.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no doubt about Philip II being the one who united most of the Greek states and Alexander the Great being a world-famous conqueror, perceived as a [[hero]] of this ancient period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burger|first1=Michael|title=The Shaping of Western Civilization: From Antiquity to the Enlightenment|date=2008|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=1551114321|page=76|quote=In the end, the Greeks would fall under the rule of a single man, who would unify Greece: Philip II, king of Macedon (360-336 BC).

However, only the rise of Macedonia made the realization of pan-Hellenic unity possible."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the narrative brought forward by the VMRO-DPMNE, Alexander the Great was clearly not a Greek. According to this version of history, most of the cultural achievements which are perceived as being from Greek origin by historians and laypersons around the world are actually ethnic Macedonian achievements. Therefore, in the view of some, [[Hellenistic period|Hellenism]]’s true name would actually be Macedonianism. The Republic of Macedonia would thus be the owner of great cultural heritage, which always had been denied by the world. And as the then [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Macedonia]] [[Nikola Gruevski]] put it, it can finally present its true history that has been silenced for so long. Macedonia, in this view is seen as the cradle of [[Culture of Europe|European civilization]].&lt;ref name=Kubiena88&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern Macedonian narrative, it is no contradiction that modern [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] speak the [[Macedonian language]], a [[South Slavic languages|southern Slavic language]]. It is a considerable consensus in historical sciences that [[Slavs | Slavic people]] immigrated into the [[Balkans]] and the region of [[Macedonia (region) | Macedonia]] around the 6th century. From a modern Macedonian perspective, the Slavic people assimilated to the [[Indigenous peoples|autochthonous population]], who were direct descendants of the [[Ancient Macedonians]], and intermingled with other local groups. For some reason Slavic languages remained dominant, but according to this historical narrative this cannot be understood as a clue for modern Macedonians being of Slavic descent. Rather, they are descendants from several local groups, one of which were the Ancient Macedonians.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Similar conflicts or diverging perspectives on the true course of history emerged around heroic Slavic-speaking figures from the geographic region Macedonia who fought against the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]], like [[Dame Gruev]] and [[Gotse Delchev]]. But did these people fight for freedom and an independent Macedonian state? Or did they fight for independence from the Ottoman Empire in order to include this area into a [[Greater Bulgaria]]? Similarly to [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]] and other Balkan states see Macedonia presenting supposedly Macedonian heroes, which they actually claim to be Bulgarian or respectively Greek.&lt;ref name=Georgievski&gt;Georgievski, Boris (2009): Ghosts of the Past Endanger Macedonia's Future: Balkan Insight.

In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern Macedonian narrative, these people evidently fought for an independent Macedonian state with a Macedonian nation and identity that is clearly distinctive to the Slavic [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian identity]]. In this narrative there is little to no space for the impact of more than five hundred years of Ottoman rule in the region. And also the time under the rule of [[Yugoslavia]] is almost left out in VMRO-DPMNE's modern narrative. In the Yugoslav era, the focus was on southern Slavic brotherhood and [[socialism]], which would obscure the supposed non-Slavic background of the Macedonian nation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Examples of 'antiquization'==
Strongly promoted by VMRO-DPMNE politicians, the recollection of Macedonia's heroic past is supported by (pseudo-) scientists, media and civil society efforts. Some historians emphasize the before-mentioned historical continuity;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Vangeli, 2011: 20: “For instance, the newest official “History of the Macedonian People” published by the Institute for National History in 2009, argues that during the interaction of the immigrant Slavs and the native Ancient Macedonians, the ancient features prevailed and defined the development of the region (Ĉepreganov et al.). This resembles a major revision of the Institute’s position, which since its foundation, had argued that after the Great Migration, Slavs imposed their culture in the new lands, thus Macedonian culture was Slavic. Mitko Panov, the major author of the chapters on ancient and medieval history, has published a series of articles (“Antiĉkite Makedonci”; “Vizantiskiot kontinuitet”) stating that Ancient Macedonians “kept on existing as a people, preserving its ethnic hallmarks and traditions” even in the period of the Great Migration, which influenced the “self-identification” of the immigrant Slavs, even the whole Byzantine culture. He has argued that the political “tendency of the historiography in SFRY based (. . .) on the relations between Belgrade and Athens” has produced ignorance towards the obvious continuity of Ancient Macedonians (Panov, “Antiĉkite Makedonci”)”.&lt;/ref&gt; archaeologists and linguists present evidence for the resemblance of the language of the ancient Macedonians and the modern Macedonian – a south Slavic language; genealogists offer the alleged scientific proof of the similarity of the DNS of ancient Macedonians and the DNS of the modern Macedonians,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Vangeli, 2011: 20: “Particularly valuable has been the survey by the Swiss project iGenea whose findings were interpreted to prove that “Macedonians have more ancient Macedonian blood” than Greeks, which, on the other hand, have sub-Saharan origin (Aleksovska). While the survey has stirred very positive public reactions, officials have not used it as part of the antiquization process.”; see also: http://www.igenea.com/en/home.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the Greeks have to accept that a blood relationship with the ancient Macedonians cannot be testified.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,31&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation.

In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extensive cultural politics described by “antiquization” not only describe an identitarian narrative promoted by VMRO-DPMNE. It also supports this narrative with the renaming of important public places, the staging of public events, architectural projects and interference in public education. The former City Stadium has been renamed into “[[Philip II Arena |National Arena Philip II of Macedonia]]”. The [[Skopje "Alexander the Great" Airport |airport of Skopje]] is now called “Alexander the Great”, just as one of the main motorways, which is part of the pan-European Corridor Nr. 10. A central square in Skopje bears the name “Pella Square” named after [[Pella]], the capital of the ancient kingdom of Macedon.&lt;ref name=Georgievski /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gori, Maja (2014): Fabricating Identity from Ancient Shards: Construction and Cultural Appropriation in the New Macedonian Question.

The numerous statues which represent supposed Macedonian heroes, the newly erected [[triumphal arch]] Porta Makedonija, the lately constructed buildings for cultural and governmental purposes in [[Baroque Revival architecture|neo-Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture]], the renewed facades of old socialist blocks, the new and the recently redesigned bridges: It all gives the impression of a manifestation of the Macedonian identity politics being carved in stone.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation.

The figures displayed in the project range from [[Alexander the Great]], [[Justinian I]] (Emperor of the Roman [[Byzantine Empire]]), and Christian missionaries of the 1st millennium to revolutionary characters of the late 19th and early 20th century. According to Valentina Bozinovska, chair woman of the state commission for relations with religious communities, "[...] the Skopje 2014 project is a statement of all that we have had from the ancient period until today. For the first time we have a chance to create a tangible manifestation of Macedonian identity. [...] Civilization practically started here".&lt;ref&gt;Diminishkovska, 2010 in: Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The sum paid by the project's main investor VMRO-DPMNE, range, depending on the source, from 80 to 200 million [[Euro]]s. Some critics even predict a total sum up to 500 million Euros. &lt;ref name=Muhic141 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kubiena88 /&gt; 

In addition, new traditions are being (re-)invented in the way that Ancient Macedonian holidays are added or existing holidays expanded with Ancient Macedonian features and/or new ceremonies. &lt;ref name=Vangeli19&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), pp. 19ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example fitting into the antiquization narrative is based on an ethnological study in the [[Hunza Valley]] of [[Pakistan]], situated in the Pakistani part of the [[Himalayas]]. The study revealed that people of the [[Burusho people|Burusho]] tribe maintain the legend of being descendants of soldiers of the army of Alexander the Great, and therefore regard Macedonia as their homeland. As a consequence, in 2008 a delegation of the Hunza royal family visited Macedonia and was “welcomed home” by the Prime Minister, the Archbishop of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, the Mayor of Skopje and a flag-waving crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnwasser, Matthew (2008): Macedonia dispute has an Asian flavor - The New York Times.

Further, as part of a governmental campaign, videos were broadcast that featured Alexander the Great as the liberator of African and Asian people, saying, it is not Macedonian to retreat. On another occasion the movie “[[Macedonian Prayer (video) |Macedonian prayer]]” was broadcast by the state-governed national television at prime time. Being directed by a member of the Diaspora organization [[World Macedonian Congress]], this movie claims that the Macedonians were created by God before anyone else and that they constitute the origin of the [[White people|white race]].&lt;ref name=Vangeli18 /&gt;

Analyses of Macedonian textbooks revealed that the recent politics of history have also influenced the knowledge taught in schools. For instance, this is demonstrated in the way the particularity of the ethnic Macedonians throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman era]] is delineated.&lt;ref&gt;Stojanov, Darko (2014): In search of autochthony: A case study of the Great Migration Period as presented in history textbooks in Macedonia. In ''Povijest u nastavi'' 10 (19 (1)), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traces of 'antiquization' in the past==
Macedonian antiquization as it can be observed recently, is regarded as a rather young phenomenon that developed its full potential for political mobilization in the last years, as a substantial element of the political agenda of the ruling party VMRO-DPMNE. Yet, traces of antiquization, albeit not called like this, can be found in the past. Some see the background of antiquization in the 19th and early 20th century and the “myth of ancient descent among Orthodox Slavic speakers in Macedonia, adopted partially due to Greek cultural inputs”.&lt;ref name=Vangeli13&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Macedonian narratives===
Important for endorsing such beliefs were anti-Bulgarian attempts by secular and religious Greek institutions. One of these Greek approaches was the spread of the myth of the origin from Alexander the Great and Ancient Macedonians. Greek priests and academics tried to convince the local Orthodox Slavic-speaking population that they were Macedonians, directly related to Alexander the Great, and, as a result, Greeks. The aim was to persuade these people to turn away from Slavic exertion of influence and to accept the authority of the government in [[Athens]].&lt;ref name=Vangeli15&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last quarter of the 19th century in the geographic region called Macedonia, which constituted the last part of the Ottoman Empire on the Balkan Peninsula that still had not gained independence, a serious struggle emerged about the national affiliation of the Christian Slavs. However, the claims of the already independent states [[Principality of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] overlapped considerably, since they all could refer to Macedonia having been part of their correspondent empire during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Boskovska, Nada (2015): Makedonien - ein historischer Überblick. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wherever one might locate the origin of Ancient Macedonian nationhood among parts of the Orthodox Slavic speaking population: national myths inspired by antiquity did not play an important role in any of the events that [[Macedonian historiography]] regards as a milestone of present-day Macedonian state- and nationhood - above all the [[Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising |Ilinden Uprising]] and the [[Kruševo Republic]] in 1903.&lt;ref name=Vangeli15 /&gt; Michael Kubiena states that at the times of the [[Macedonian Struggle]] and the [[Balkan Wars]], considerable parts of the local populations worried more about social and economic stability, than about “dying for nationalisms”.&lt;ref&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; "Ethnicity was as much the consequence as the cause of this unrest; revolutionary violence produced national affiliations as well as being produced by them".&lt;ref&gt;Mazower, 2000 in: Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "there have neither been any references towards Alexander the Great or Ancient Macedonia in the iconography and the popular mythology of the interwar platforms for the Macedonian national liberation. As well, they have been absent in the [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisan movement]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and were not referred to in the proclamation of the Macedonian statehood in 1944".&lt;ref name=Vangeli15 /&gt; 

A narrative that comes close to the notion of Ancient Macedonian nationhood during the coming into being of a modern Macedonian state, was the idea of a [[United Macedonia |United or Greater Macedonia]], which was based on the estimated territory of the Ancient Kingdom of Macedon under the rule of Philip II. Early national poets used those borders in order to define a corresponding nation in their writings. The [[Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia |ASNOM]] manifesto (English: Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia; Macedonian: Antifašističko Sobranie za Narodno Osloboduvanje na Makedonija) took reference to the “shameful partition” of Macedonia in the course of the Balkan Wars and it contained the appeal to the “Macedonians under Bulgaria and Greece” to take part in the anti-fascist fight and the struggle for Macedonian unification.&lt;ref name=Vangeli15 /&gt;

Under the rule of [[Josip Broz Tito]] in Yugoslavia, Macedonia was recognized for the first time as an individual ethnic and political entity.&lt;ref&gt;Mazower, Mark (2000): The Balkans. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (Universal history).&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, some regard the reason for the recognition of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] by Tito and his government as a pragmatic decision, inasmuch as the Macedonian national consciousness seemed a rather strong force, whose suppression might have been a demanding task.&lt;ref&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of a Greater Macedonia was also regarded as a crucial resource for Tito's expansionist ideas. The ideal was a greater [[Balkan Federation]] through the inclusion of Bulgaria and Greece. These plans stopped when Greek and Yugoslav communists split due to the discord between Tito and [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref name=Vangeli15 /&gt;

Important for the Macedonian nation building process was the standardization of the [[Macedonian language]], as well as the publication of a national history. For this reason the Institute for National History was founded in 1948 through a government decree. What followed was the formation and reformation of national creation myths in academic circles and institutions, spearheaded by the Institute for National History and influenced by the interplay of politics, national interests and historiography and the subsequent creation of “historical ‘Masterpieces’” in order to support the uniqueness of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2005): Ancient Nationhood and the Struggle for Statehood: Historiographic Myths in the Republic of Macedonia.

In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stefan Troebst, concerning this matter, Macedonia has been regarded as an exception among the Yugoslavian states, since “the ideology of Yugoslavianism proclaimed in 1952 was here once again subordinated to the one of Macedonism”. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In Yugoslav times, several narratives of origin existed and the myth of Ancient Macedonian origin was incorporated in the nation building process. Nevertheless, according to Vangeli (and contrasting Troebst's view), this narrative was subordinated to the narrative of Yugoslav (i.e. South Slav) origin, which played a central role in Tito's Yugoslavian nation-building process. However, references to antiquity, for instance by means of official history books, were institutionalized already in Yugoslavian times.&lt;ref name=Vangeli16 /&gt; As Vangeli analyzes, the notion of Macedonian ancient history “[still] was taken with a reserve, and was mostly instrumentalized in the disputes with Bulgarian historiography and also as a protection from the nationalist discourse among certain Macedonians that was based on the idea of ‘returning the Bulgarian consciousness’ of Macedonians”.&lt;ref name=Vangeli16 /&gt;

Although official institutions used the recollection of antiquity in moderate ways, Ancient Macedonian narratives were crucial for the nationalism of parts of the [[Macedonian Diaspora]]. Agnew states, that “the 1980s had seen the emergence in Yugoslav Macedonia and in the Macedonian Diaspora (particularly in [[Macedonian Australian|Australia]] and [[Macedonian Canadians|Canada]]) of a ‘‘Macedonism’’ or [[Macedonian nationalism]] that drew exactly opposite conclusions about the ‘‘ethnicity’’ of ancient Macedonia and Alexander the Great than did [[Greek nationalism]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Agnew, John (2007): No Borders, No Nations: Making Greece in Macedonia. In: ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'' 97 (2), p. 408. DOI: 10.1111/j.1467-8306.2007.00545.x.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been evidence, that organization established by members of the Macedonian Diaspora in Australia, Canada and the [[Macedonian American|United States]] used ancient Macedonian symbols for representation purposes already before 1980. Further it has been argued, that ethnic Macedonian refugees who fled from [[Greek Macedonia]] in the times of the [[Greek Civil War]], were crucial for this initial development of antiquization, as the narrative of ancient descent has been regarded as credible among Greeks and ethnic Macedonians or [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|Slavs in Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Roudometof, Victor (1996): Nationalism and identity politics in the Balkans: Greece and the Macedonian question. In ''Journal of Modern Greek Studies'' 14 (2), pp. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-independence period=== 
When the Republic of Macedonia declared its independence in 1991 and hence re-opened the national question, it faced criticism and denial from various sides and in various ways, which might have served as a source of inspiration for nationalistic discourses and later antiquization.&lt;ref name=Muhic138&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia.

In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; While most states accepted the young state, some countries denied the independency of a Macedonian nation, the existence of a Macedonian language and the singularity of a Macedonian identity. Even nowadays, for instance, many Bulgarians, although officially recognizing the Republic of Macedonia, still regard Macedonians as ‘actually’ being Bulgarians.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,33&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], most churches are organized on a national level. The independence of an Orthodox church is thus directly linked to a nation's recognition. However, to this day, the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian]], [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek]] churches do not acknowledge the Macedonian Orthodox church, which can be interpreted as calling the existence of a Macedonian nation into question.&lt;ref name=Kubiena82&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History?

From a Macedonian perspective, the negation of a distinctive Macedonian language, history and customs seemed and seems like a fundamental challenge for their national identity. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Name and flag dispute with Greece===
Already shortly after the independence in 1992, official institutions gradually highlighted the ancient past more and more. The post-independence version of the official “History of the Macedonian People” dealt with the topic of the Ancient Macedonian Kingdom on 200 pages. In comparison, the edition from the year 1969 needed only 20 pages to treat the same topic.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2005): Ancient Nationhood and the Struggle for Statehood: Historiographic Myths in the Republic of Macedonia. In Pål Kolstø (Ed.): Myths and boundaries in south-eastern Europe. London: Hurst &amp; Co., p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the [[flag of the Republic of Macedonia]], the first public display of what later has been called antiquization, caused serious tensions with its neighboring country Greece. The new flag of the Republic of Macedonia depicted the [[Vergina Sun|Star of Vergina]]. This symbol, discovered in the 1970s, is regarded as the symbol of the [[Argead dynasty]], the ancient royal family of the kingdom of Macedon. It is claimed by Greece to be an integral part of its cultural and historical heritage.&lt;ref name=Vangeli17&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; This flag dispute went along with the infamous [[Macedonia naming dispute |name dispute]], since Greece also would not accept the name “Republic of Macedonia” for its neighboring country, as it feared usurpation of history as well as territorial claims from the Slavic-Macedonian side. Further, Greece rejects the term “Macedonian” for the description of the south Slavic language spoken in the Republic of Macedonia, as well as for the local population.&lt;ref name=Gromes163 /&gt; Due to political pressure by the Greek government, which eventually led to the signing of an [[Macedonia naming dispute#Interim Accord|Interim Accord]] in 1995, Macedonia temporally adopted the name “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” for international use, removed the Star of Vergina from its flag and erased all allegedly [[Irredentism|irredentist]] clauses from its constitution. Macedonia also had to refrain from using symbols that constitute a part of Greece’ historic or cultural patrimony.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations: United Nations Treaty No. 32193 Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia - Interim Accord. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of this agreement most narratives of Ancient Macedonian descent were suspended by official institutions. Yet, the myths of Ancient Macedonian origin never totally disappeared in all political and academic circles. Similarly, the ancient past remained a substantial part of Macedonian national history in history textbooks.&lt;ref name=Vangeli17 /&gt; 

The name dispute with Greece, which is still not solved, is not only a matter of political conflict, but through the construction of history and claims for heritage, this matter is advanced by scientific advocates for national causes on both sides.&lt;ref name=Kubiena86&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Étienne Balibar]] describes the importance of a nation's name for the national identity.&lt;ref name=Balibar&gt;Balibar, Etienne (1991): The Nation Form. History and Idiology. In Etienne Balibar, Immanuel Maurice Wallerstein (Eds.): Race, nation, class: ambiguous identities: Verso, pp. 86–106.&lt;/ref&gt; The consequent contestation of the name chosen by Macedonia obviously is a cause of frustration for the Macedonian government and parts of the population. If no solution will be found, the name dispute threatens to further block Macedonia's membership in the [[NATO]] as well as its accession to the [[European Union]]. [[Nikola Gruevski]], Macedonia's current prime minister and leader of the VMRO-DPMNE, stated that “his government and the population are not willing to tolerate ‘blackmailing’ by their Greek neighbors and perceive their request for a name-change as a threat to Macedonian identity”.&lt;ref name=Kubiena86 /&gt; Negating Macedonia's name and identity is thus perceived as negating the existence of Macedonians in general. In this manner, the name dispute plays a crucial role in the strengthening of national discourses, artistic production and serious tensions between the two major ethnic groups in Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; For some ethnic Macedonians the name of the country has an existential meaning, since it is inseparably linked to their nation. For other population groups in Macedonia the country's name does not have this importance. They are rather unsatisfied that the government is not willing to concede in this matter, which would improve the foreign policy situation of the country and, hence, the country's economical opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Boskovska, Nada (2015): Makedonien - ein historischer Überblick. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===NATO and European Union accession===
In April 2008, Greece blocked the [[Accession of Macedonia to NATO]] with a veto at the [[2008 Bucharest summit |Bucharest summit]]. Subsequently, in 2009, the Greek government prevented Macedonia from getting a date on part of the European Union for starting accession talks. The [[Accession of Macedonia to the European Union]] is still pending.&lt;ref name=Graewert25&gt;Graewert, Tim (2015): Die Regierungen Makedoniens 1990-2014 zwischen regionaler Vorbildfunktion und autoritärer Versuchung. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gromes163 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vangeli18 /&gt; It has been argued, that since then, antiquization has “snowballed into a wider phenomenon”. As Macedonia's president [[Gjorge Ivanov]] announced, “the Classical drive” has its roots in “the frustration and depression felt after the NATO Summit in Bucharest”.&lt;ref name=Georgievski /&gt;

According to Graewert, the political elite of Macedonia enabled a peaceful secession from [[Yugoslav Wars|war-torn Yugoslavia]] in 1991. Ten years later they managed the relatively mild, compared to the [[Kosovo War]],  settlement of the armed conflict with the [[National Liberation Army (Albanians of Macedonia)|UÇK]]. In a regional comparison these achievements have been regarded as a best-practice model. Thus, in 2005 Macedonia was rewarded with the status of an EU candidate country. But since Greece stopped Macedonia's NATO accession in violation of the law of nations, on the one hand, the Macedonian government has surrendered to the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] temptation and increasingly shown semi-[[Autocracy|autocratic]] tendencies,&lt;ref name=Graewert25 /&gt; and on the other hand, the self-consciousness of the majority of ethnic Macedonians has been additionally perpetuated.&lt;ref name=Vangeli22&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The potentially upcoming EU membership had been perceived as an important step for Macedonia's economic progress. And the NATO affiliation had been regarded as a promise that violent incidents such as the [[2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|2001 conflict]] would not be repeated.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The fact of being excluded from these organizations despite the investments and reforms that had been undertaken, ultimately revitalized the uncertainty concerning the country's economic and security perspectives. This has strengthened the “defeatist attitude”, that, irrespective of the efforts of the Macedonian government, Greece and other opponents would always find a possibility to block Macedonia's progress.&lt;ref name=Vangeli22 /&gt; “The main engine driving nation-state building has not been Albanian-Macedonian relations, but rather the tensions with Greece over Macedonia’s name, particularly acute since the Greek veto to Macedonia’s NATO membership in 2008. The widely pursued antiquization campaign, including the megalomanic project Skopje 2014, have emphasized promoting one ethnic defined identity”.&lt;ref&gt;Bieber, Florian (2011): Introduction: Assessing the Ohrid Framework Agreement. In Marija Risteska, Zhidas Daskalovski (Eds.): Assessing the Ohrid Framework Agreement, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it has been argued, that Greece showed vigorous reactions to the initial antiquization policies, such as the renaming of Skopje's airport in 2007, which subsequently altered Greece's attitude towards the Republic of Macedonia. In the end, the name issue and next to it the symbolic dispute about the ancient Macedonian heritage became the last obstacle on Macedonia's unsuccessful way to negotiations for full EU membership.&lt;ref name=Vangeli25&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===VMRO–DPMNE's arrival to power===
In the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2006]], VMRO-DPMNE became the largest power in the [[Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia]]. Since the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2008]], the ruling party, led by Prime Minister [[Nikola Gruevski]], formed a coalition with the largest Albanian party, [[Democratic Union for Integration |DUI]] (Democratic Union for Integration).&lt;ref&gt;Gromes, Thorsten (2012): Ohne Staat und Nation ist keine Demokratie zu machen. Bosnien und Herzegowina, Kosovo und Makedonien nach den Bürgerkriegen. 1. Aufl. Baden-Baden: Nomos (Studien der Hessischen Stiftung Friedens- und Konfliktforschung, 17). p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this period after the arrival to power of the VMRO-DPMNE that is inseparably linked to antiquization, since it is the time when the myths of ancient nationhood gained new importance due to VMRO-DPMNE's devotion to nationalist and identitarian politics. It is the time when antiquization gained its full potential for political mobilization, when the “name of Alexander the Great was used to simply depict the nation’s grandeur and to nourish the people’s spirit” &lt;ref name=Vangeli17 /&gt; and when the VMRO-DPMNE “aimed to gain the loyalty of Macedonian nationalists once again” &lt;ref name=Vangeli18 /&gt; through the celebration of national mythology. It is this period, which experienced all the example of antiquization described above.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Perceptions of 'antiquization'==
===Government (VMRO-DPMNE) position===
The perceptions of the identitarian and historical politics of VMRO-DPMNE in Macedonia and across the globe differ strongly. VMRO-DPMNE presents its policies and their visual manifestation as the representation of the true Macedonian history. According to this viewpoint it is not inventing but representing history as it was and rewriting a hidden history.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), pp. 150ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquization politics and Skopje 2014 are often represented as being conducted and facilitated by the government. This is applicable to the VMRO-DPMNE, the leading party of the government, which seeks to represent issues of the ethnic Macedonian majority of the country, but as Ulf Brunnbauer points out, the coalition partner DUI, rejects these policies.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,29&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Proponents of the government's politics of the recollection of ancient Macedonian origin and its display in Skopje 2014 argue that “it neatly offers a linear chronological overview of all things Macedonian”.&lt;ref name=Muhic141 /&gt; In this view, Skopje 2014 is seen as an opportunity for history to neutrally speak for itself, as if the understanding and presentation of history would not be ideologically and politically disputed but rather obvious and objective. Accordingly, this (re)presentation of history is thus not influenced by VMRO-DPMNE's ideological beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “antiquization”, which reveals a willing recollection and re-interpretation of an alleged ancient past, is thus dismissed by government proponents as an “invented [[neologism]] in a broad anti-Macedonian [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]]”&lt;ref name=Vangeli13 /&gt; that tries to undermine Macedonia's true historical grandeur.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Critical perspectives on 'antiquization'===
The recollection of antiquity of the VMRO-DPMNE, so-called antiquization, experiences strong criticism from various directions and for various reasons. Macedonian and international civil society, scholars, oppositional politicians and neighboring countries, in particular Greece and Bulgaria, express their dislike. A lot of criticism refers to political, legal, esthetical and financial aspects concerning Skopje 2014. This article focuses mainly on criticism about the historical and political content and implications of the whole narrative referred to by “antiquization”, from which Skopje 2014 constitutes only one, but a very noticeable aspect. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

====Ethno-nationalistic discourse====
Among critics, antiquization is seen as an ethno-nationalistic discourse that is built around the outstanding figure of Alexander the Great. This power-ridden hegemonic discourse is mainly imposed by the political elite and the VMRO-DPMNE&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vangeli25 /&gt; and is based upon a process of rereading history. Such a process of the highly selective nationalist reading of history, the selective remembering and un-remembering of specific matters is regarded as essential for nationalist political mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;Coackley, John (2004): MOBILIZING THE PAST: NATIONALIST IMAGES OF HISTORY. In ''Nationalism and Ethnic Politics'' 10 (4), pp. 531–560.&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, some sections of the scientific and pseudo-scientific public increasingly fostered this process.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

====Myths of continuity and autochthony====
Linked to this nationalistic discourse is the construction of a national Macedonian identity. According to Brunnbauer, the Macedonian state just starts to get engaged with a project which its neighboring countries performed already in the course of the 19th century: to design a historical myth, which is based upon the ideas of historical continuity and [[Indigenism|autochthonous]] origin.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,31 /&gt; The aim is to “proof” or to convince Macedonians to believe in the continuity of ‘the’ Macedonian history and the direct descent of the modern ethnic Macedonians from the Ancient Macedonians. The endeavor is nothing less than drawing an uninterrupted line from the ancient Kingdom of Macedon to the present, in order to emphasize the great achievements of the Macedonian nation, its heritage and its peculiarity.&lt;ref&gt;Stojanov, Darko (2014): In search of autochthony: A case study of the Great Migration Period as presented in history textbooks in Macedonia. In ''Povijest u nastavi'' 10 (19 (1)), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a nationalist Macedonian perspective, the self-portrayal as descendants of the Ancient Macedonians has the advantage of presenting the Macedonians as an autochthonous people. In this way, a claim on Macedonian territory can be substantiated.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,31 /&gt; In the words of [[Margaret MacMillan]] "History provides much of the fuel for nationalism. It creates the collective memories that help to bring the nation into being. The shared celebration of the nation’s great achievements – and the shared sorrow at its defeat – sustain and foster it. The further back the history appears to go, the more solid and enduring the nation seems – and the worthier its claims".&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan, Margaret (2010): Dangerous games. The uses and abuses of history. Modern Library paperback ed. New York: Modern Library (A Modern Library chronicles book, 31), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; These claims not only contain territory. The principle of autochthonism also comprises the historical right of a nation to control certain symbols – “the older the nation is imagined, the more powerful it is, thus the more right it has to manifest its dominion”.&lt;ref name=Vangeli23&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), pp. 23ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Macedonian case the government attempts to legitimize its right to the name and the remaining symbolical capital of Macedonia by means of the supposed straight link with the Ancient Kingdom. The myth of autochthony also supplies the need to distinguish ethnic Macedonians from their neighbors and ethnically differing compatriots, as it suggests that the ancestors of the Macedonians lived in this area before it was populated by the ancestors of the neighboring peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Balibar refers to the myth of origins and national continuity as "an effective ideological form, in which the imaginary singularity of national formation is constructed daily, by moving back from present into history".&lt;ref name=Balibar /&gt; However, unpleasing for the Macedonians is the fact that substantial components of their myth already constitute fundamental elements of the interpretation of national history from their neighboring countries. As a consequence they experience aggressive repudiation for their claims&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,31 /&gt;

Another point of critique against the antiquization narrative and Skopje 2014 aims at the alleged neatly “linear chronological overview of all things Macedonian”. Maja Muhić and Aleksandar Takovski regard this claim as ironic, since they almost cannot find any correlation between the represented figures that are used to demonstrate the continuity of Macedonian national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

A challenge for the continuity narrative and a reason for the conflicting national historical claims of the different states in the Balkans is the dynamic and changeful past of this region. A part of what is nowadays called the geographical region Macedonia, belonged to the Ancient Kingdom of Macedon. Thereafter, at various times, the term ‘Macedonia’ covered different administrative districts of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. None of these districts was permanent or stable. Already in Byzantine times, Byzantine writers used the terms “Macedonia” and “Macedonians” in different, sometimes unclear and misleading ways. “The generally accepted knowledge in today’s historiography holds that for [[Late Antiquity]], as well as for later in Byzantium, the term Macedonia/ Macedonians has a regional/provincial/geographical meaning, and certainly not an ethnic one”.&lt;ref&gt;Stojanov, Darko (2014): In search of autochthony: A case study of the Great Migration Period as presented in history textbooks in Macedonia. In ''Povijest u nastavi'' 10 (19 (1)), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

If one neglects the debate about the exact numbers, there is a rather broad consensus that during the Ottoman Empire the geographic region Macedonia was populated by [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Albanians]], [[Jews]], [[Vlachs]], [[Greeks]], [[Romani people|Roma]] and other smaller groups. However, throughout the Middle Ages and up until the early 20th century the Slavic speaking majority in the Region of Macedonia were more commonly referred to (both, by themselves and outsiders) as Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ppbuavUZKEwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Who+are+the+Macedonians&amp;hl=bg#v=snippet&amp;q=Crampton&amp;f=false|title=Who are the Macedonians?|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/im3/im_6_1.htm|title=Средновековни градови и тврдини во Македонија, Иван Микулчиќ, Македонска академија на науките и уметностите – Скопје, 1996, стр. 72.|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/da/da_summary.htm|title=Formation of the Bulgarian nation (summary) |author=Academician Dimitŭr Simeonov Angelov |publisher=Sofia-Press |year=1978 |pages=413–415 |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in pre-nationalist times, terms such as "Bulgarian" did not possess a strict ethno-nationalistic meaning in modern aspect.&lt;ref&gt;When Ethnicity Did Not Matter in the Balkans. J V A Fine. pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, in the last phase of the Ottoman Empire, fierce fighting arose about the national affiliation of these people.&lt;ref&gt;Boskovska, Nada (2015): Makedonien - ein historischer Überblick. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, at the time of the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, Greeks, Bulgarians, and Serbs tried to include Macedonia into their states.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Eben (2009): The Ethnopolitics of Territorial Division in the Republic of Macedonia. In Ethnopolitics 8 (2), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, all occurrences, events and ruptures that took place in the geographical region of Macedonia are neither a sequence of linear developments nor the inherent property of a single nation state. Nonetheless, in the attempt to consolidate their national identity, the newly emerging states in the Balkans tried to confirm singularity by claiming historical events and figures as being exclusively their own.&lt;ref&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the notion of Ancient Macedonian descent might seem explicable if one considers the name dispute with Greece and the challenges to a Macedonian identity, and also if one takes into consideration the need to gain points in the ethnic-Macedonian part of the electorate: the narrative of continuity and autochthony is not the only choice available.&lt;ref&gt;Stojanov, Darko (2014): In search of autochthony: A case study of the Great Migration Period as presented in history textbooks in Macedonia. In ''Povijest u nastavi'' 10 (19 (1)), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reasons and motivation for 'antiquization'====
Several scholars see VMRO-DPMNE's promotion of so-called antiquization as a reaction to the stagnation of Macedonia's foreign affairs due to Greek opposition to Macedonia's efforts for EU and NATO-membership. According to this view, Gruevski's government thus prioritized its consolidation of power on the national level as well as it aims at fostering Macedonia's nation building process.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,30&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graewert, Tim (2015): Die Regierungen Makedoniens 1990-2014 zwischen regionaler Vorbildfunktion und autoritärer Versuchung. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Flood describes these kinds of processes in a more general manner. Therefore, political myths and grand narratives, as for example ancient Macedonian nationhood, come up as a consequence of a situation in which a society experienced some kind of trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Christopher (2002): Political myth. A theoretical introduction. New York: Routledge (Theorists of myth), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out that the glory of a national hero like Alexander the Great helps to overcome what has been called the ‘moral crisis of [[post-communism]]’: the situation of a country that still has to handle the burden of a complex and tiresome post-communist transition, smoldering ethnicized tensions, a weak economy and low living standards.&lt;ref name=Vangeli22 /&gt; Vangeli, therefore, summarizes that “antiquity-inspired Macedonian nationalist rhetoric has emerged as a ‘compensation for backwardness’ (Hanák)&lt;ref group=note&gt;See: Hanák Péter: „A National Compensation for Backwardness“, Studies in East European  Thought, 46. 1 – 2 (1994): 33-45.&lt;/ref&gt; brought by the unsuccessful regime change and the incomplete consolidation of the new regime". However, as outlined above, Greece's opposition is also motivated by Macedonia's recollection of its alleged ancient history and descent. Both countries thus enter a vicious circle if one follows the argumentation that Greece's opposition was due to Macedonia's antiquization and Macedonia's antiquization was due to Greece's opposition. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Still, antiquization seems to effectively address the negative sentiments of some Macedonians and their feeling of being rejected. The notion of being descendants of a glorious and famous empire comforts some Macedonians and is used to strengthen national pride. The government's rhetoric of the glorious Macedonian past offers distinction from their neighbors, a legitimation for the national struggle and thus serves as an inspiration for political movements. At the same time the image of the celebrated past is contrasted to the image of a problematic and questionable present and in the end it is used for the mobilization of the masses.&lt;ref name=Vangeli22 /&gt;

Macedonian antiquization can be described as an act of communication that aims at two directions; inward as well as outward.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; One aims at the inner nation building process, the other at the representation of Macedonia in the international sphere. By using names like Alexander the Great for its airports and highways, Macedonia tries to mobilize the potential of antiquity and to gain the impact of globally known and recognized names.&lt;ref name=Vangeli23 /&gt; Further, the image of antiquity is used for tourism advertisements on international television. Government-funded campaigns promote Macedonia as the ‘Cradle of Culture’ or bear the title ‘[[Macedonia timeless]]’ while presenting Macedonian archaeology and ancient heritage. In the same way, the monuments and buildings that constitute a part of Skopje 2014 are believed to help to improve Macedonia's image for international visitors and to attract tourists on a long-term basis.&lt;ref name=Vangeli23 /&gt;

====Skopje 2014: monocultural history vs. multicultural reality====
The urban planning project Skopje 2014 plays an outstanding and exceptionally visible role in Macedonia's identitarian politics and virtually can be seen as an illustration of the whole process of antiquization. Hence, this ‘mass-production of tradition’ and its ‘statuomania’&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm, E. J.; Ranger, T. O. (1983): The Invention of tradition. Cambridge [Cambridgeshire], New York: Cambridge University Press (Past and present publications).&lt;/ref&gt; also is a central object of critique. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Critics regard Skopje 2014 as a nationalistic construction site, where nation building gets a new meaning. Here the government literally builds a national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), pp. 26–35.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the critique in terms of the content, the opposition's discourse harshly criticizes Skopje 2014 on several other grounds, including financial embezzlement and corruption; circumvention of local government laws, urban planning, and building permits; the non-transparent manner of planning and decision making; an unprofessional and devastating architectural concept; aesthetic [[kitsch]]; ‘cultural rape’ that demonstrates a lack of understanding of national and cultural values; and an expression of political [[totalitarianism]].&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,28&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation.

The sponsors of Skopje 2014, in contrast, try to avoid public debate and ideas of international as well as local experts and neglect them.&lt;ref name=Kubiena93&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major critique is obviously the high costs of the project. While government sources talk about total costs of about 80 million [[Euro]]s, critics estimate a total sum of approximately 500 million Euros.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,28 /&gt; And this in times in which 30 to 40 % of Macedonia's population are unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;De Munck, Victor C; Risteski, Ljupčo (2013): Macedonia. The political, social, economic and cultural foundations of a Balkan state. London, New York: I.B. Tauris (International library of historical studies, v. 87), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Many voices complain about such high and unfeasible costs and that the funds could have been invested differently, especially in times of a poor economic situation in Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), pp. 92ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The VMRO-DPMNE-led government has been accused of constantly prioritizing cultural policies over objective problems: in the course of a [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]], the Macedonian government spends vast amounts of its state budget on the erection of statues, the construction of monumental buildings and archaeological excavations encouraged by the myths of ancient Macedonian descent instead of focusing on real problems. In this manner identity questions could also serve as a distraction.&lt;ref name=Vangeli23 /&gt; The government, on the contrary, brings forward the argument of economic benefit. It promotes Skopje 2014 as an investment encouraging the growth of the local economy, creating new jobs and acquiring extra income from newly attracted tourists.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić and Takovski, 2014: 147: “The ‘economic benefit’ argument was brought to the fore at a press conference held at the end of April 2013 (22. 4. 2013) where the Macedonian Minister of Culture, Mrs. Elizabeta Kanceska Milevska, in an exhaustive manner attempted to justify the financial expenditure by both presenting the project cost and reminding the public of the economic benefit of the project which she described as a capital investment with a visible and verifiable impact upon structural engineering, encouraging the growth of industry, creating new jobs, and contributing to the accumulation of additional income from the number of tourist visits”.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Some scholars consider Skopje 2014 in its role as the most visible aspect of antiquization as a spectacular turning point in regard to official narratives of Macedonian national identity, turning away from previous narratives of national identity.&lt;ref name=Muhic138 /&gt; As described in the narrative referred to as antiquization, according to them, Skopje 2014 intends to construct an explicit narrative of Macedonian identity by manufacturing a continuity from antiquity over the Middle Ages to the time of Macedonia's struggle for nationhood, and incorporating this into Skopje's built environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors in the city centre of Skopje can observe the emergence of the sculptured picture of a nation who praises its uninterrupted history of 2500 years and its heroes,&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,33 /&gt; not considering whether they are being 'borrowed' from other nations, derive from shared histories or earlier, rival forms of state formation&lt;ref name=Kubiena90&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; A nation who achieved fame in the past, who spread European civilization, a nation who defended its originality and independence against seemingly superior adversaries, who obtained its nationhood, a nation who is therefore meant for greater things.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,33 /&gt; Skopje 2014 "[t]hus […] fabricates an idealized, aesteticized version of Macedonian history, by selectively transforming the world of experience into a representation of an ideological tendency and by erasing others”.&lt;ref name=Kubiena90 /&gt;

Noticeable is the gender specific iconography of the monuments of Skopje 2014. Besides [[Mother Teresa]] there is only one other woman represented in a central position. A nameless pregnant woman who gives birth to a child, breast-feeds it, and subsequently nurtures it. This fountain constellation is called “Mothers of Macedonia”. The represented men, however, bear names and fight for the nation. In Brunnbauer's view, this perfectly illustrates the understanding of [[gender role]]s in traditional 19th century [[nationalism]].&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,34&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), pp. 34ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neglecting Ottoman and Yugoslav times====
At first sight it seems ironic that social scientists assert that the identitarian policies of VMRO-DPMNE and its manifestation in Skopje 2014 present disrupted narratives, since the way the past is remembered simply ignores and in its consequence deletes important parts of the history of the region. Critics point out that the remembrance of the Ottoman times is neglected, although over five hundred years of Ottoman rule and culture left its traces in the whole region. They even speak about a “de-Ottomanization” process obliterating Ottoman heritage and moving away from [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Mattioli, Fabio (2013): Unchanging boundaries: the reconstruction of Skopje and the politics of heritage. In ''International Journal of Heritage Studies'' 20 (6), p. 601.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Muhic142 /&gt; Also the Yugoslavian times, which had significant impact on the young Macedonian state as well, are cut out of the alleged historical continuity. For VMRO-DPMNE both periods constitute an [[anathema]]: the Ottoman rule - the so-called Turkish yoke – is regarded as the dark 500 years. The affiliation to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] is seen as the time of suppressing Macedonia's striving for autonomy.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,29 /&gt; The intended cutting off of the socialist legacy&lt;ref name=Koteska /&gt; again seems ironic, since it was under the guidance and as part of the SFRY that the Republic of Macedonia was constituted for the first time in the year 1944.&lt;ref name=Muhic142 /&gt;

In Muhić and Takovskis’ view, Skopje 2014 “aims at creating a Macedonian, Orthodox Christian national identity amidst competing neighbouring agendas and the multicultural setting of the country. It does so by tearing apart, fragmenting and creating discontinuous segments of the organic tissue of the history of this region and country for the benefit of a few and the loss of the vast majority of Macedonian citizens”.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Also other authors describe Skopje 2014 as a project aimed at redefining Skopje's urban character within a short time. New buildings disguise and hide the [[Modern architecture|modernist constructions]] of the Yugoslav period as well as the [[Ottoman architecture]] of the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje |Carcija]] (the old Turkish Bazaar), which have been the two most distinctive characteristics of the city.&lt;ref name=Graan161&gt;Graan, Andrew (2013): COUNTERFEITING THE NATION? Skopje 2014 and the Politics of Nation Branding in Macedonia. In ''Cultural Anthropology'' 28 (1), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koteska /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), pp. 87ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mattioli, Fabio (2013): Unchanging boundaries: the reconstruction of Skopje and the politics of heritage. In International Journal of Heritage Studies 20 (6), p. 600.&lt;/ref&gt; “Instead, the project promises Skopje a new image, one that will deliver Macedonia a properly “European” capital, at once attractive to outsiders and worthy of national pride”.&lt;ref name=Graan161 /&gt;

====Inter-ethnic tensions====
Further, critics claim, that the identitarian politics, by writing a mono-ethnic and mono-cultural history, not only leave out certain parts of the country's history, but that the multicultural reality of the Macedonian Republic is being ignored. Disregarding the Ottoman and Muslim heritage, emphasizing the Christian cultural imprint, focusing only on matters regarding the origin of ethnic Macedonians and ignoring the multicultural Macedonian reality, pushes the [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Albanian population]] and other minority groups such as Turks, Vlachs, Serbs and Roma to the side and signals that they are not an integral part of Macedonian history and, hence, Macedonia.&lt;ref name=Koteska /&gt;&lt;ref name=Muhic142 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vangeli24&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics describe that the multicultural approach that was elaborated in the [[Ohrid Framework Agreement]] (OFA) in 2001 and improved the conditions of the Albanian population, is now rejected due to antiquization and Skopje 2014. It has also been stated that this mono-ethnic display and interpretation of history symbolically degrades ethnic Albanians to the status they had before the 2001 agreement. This is to say that antiquization and Skopje 2014 erode the basis of the post-OFA Macedonian society, i.e. the inclusive model of representation and the recognition of [[cultural diversity]]. Leading to a re-ethnicization of multiple levels of society.&lt;ref name=Muhic142 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Spaskovska&gt;Spaskovska, Ljubica (2012): The fractured ‘we’ and the ethno-national ‘I’: the Macedonian citizenship framework. In ''Citizenship Studies'' 16 (3-4), p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vangeli24 /&gt;
	
Even [[Sam Vaknin]], a former advisor to Prime Minister Gruevski, delineated antiquization as an [[Albanophobia|anti-Albanian]] nation-building project, rather than being [[Anti-Greek sentiment|anti-Greek]] or anti-Bulgarian.&lt;ref name=Georgievski /&gt; Also other authors regard Skopje 2014 as a message in the permanent tensions between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority. They coincide in their view upon Skopje 2014 having an ethnic-Macedonian connotation, ignoring the ethnic plurality of the city. In Brunnbauer's view, this also serves to demonstrate the Macedonian claim to ownership of “their” capital, which they see threatened by the Albanians.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,30 /&gt;
	
Skopje 2014 does not offer any space for symbols of reconciliation. For instance the 2001 conflict between mainly ethnic Macedonian armed forces and the Albanian guerilla is remembered and represented only from an ethnic-Macedonian perspective. The "strategic positioning of some of the religion-inspired statues rather appear as a provocation of the predominantly Muslim Albanian community".&lt;ref name=Kubiena90 /&gt; The construction of a new Orthodox church on the main city square, as it had been planned and presented in the Skopje 2014 promotion video, could so far be prevented due to engaged protest.&lt;ref name=Kubiena93 /&gt;
	
Antiquization and Skopje 2014 are widely perceived as causing deterioration in inter-ethnic relations. Minority groups in Macedonia oppose the one-sided ethnocentric approach of antiquization and leading Albanians have warned about the growing frustration among non-Macedonians. Furthermore, Skopje 2014 is largely regarded as blocking Macedonia's [[European integration]] process, which some observers consider as one main strategic goal of Albanian politics in Macedonia.&lt;ref name=Gromes164&gt;Gromes, Thorsten (2012): Ohne Staat und Nation ist keine Demokratie zu machen. Bosnien und Herzegowina, Kosovo und Makedonien nach den Bürgerkriegen. 1. Aufl. Baden-Baden: Nomos (Studien der Hessischen Stiftung Friedens- und Konfliktforschung, 17), p.164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Muhic142 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vangeli24&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, an enduring blockade of the integration could foster ethnic conflicts. And according to Gromes, without the perspective of the accession to the European Union, the incentive disappears to further work on ethnic balancing and the implementation of the OFA.&lt;ref name=Gromes164 /&gt; In this manner, the name dispute and the struggle about historical heritage with neighboring Greece could heavily burden Macedonian-Albanian relations. A Survey reveals that 17 percent of the ethnic Macedonians and 78 percent of the ethnic Albanians favor a change of the constitutional name “Republic of Macedonia”.&lt;ref&gt;Rosůlek, Přemysl (2011): Macedonina in 2011 - on the way towards stabilization or before the new 'grand' agreement? In Marija Risteska, Zhidas Daskalovski (Eds.): Assessing the Ohrid Framework Agreement, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey indicates that 82 percent of the ethnic Macedonians prioritize the name “Republic of Macedonia” over NATO and European Union accessions.&lt;ref&gt;Gromes, Thorsten (2012): Ohne Staat und Nation ist keine Demokratie zu machen. Bosnien und Herzegowina, Kosovo und Makedonien nach den Bürgerkriegen. 1. Aufl. Baden-Baden: Nomos (Studien der Hessischen Stiftung Friedens- und Konfliktforschung, 17).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intra-Macedonian tensions====
It has been argued, that the antiquization process illustrates a situation of power imbalance and power abuse within Macedonian internal politics. It has been described that the government-led discourse attempted to silence opposing voices and by doing so risking the elimination of public space and the emergence of insuperable ideological, political and social gaps in an already unstable social and political realities.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; These societal fissures do not only run along ethnic lines but even disunite ethnic Macedonians for various reasons, as for instance believing in Slavic or Ancient descent or supporting VMRO-DPMNE or [[SDSM]].&lt;ref name=Vangeli24 /&gt;

==Consequences of 'antiquization' from a critical perspective==
The processes in Macedonia that have been called antiquization, show, which significance the ones in power give to history as a resource for political legitimacy and mobilization.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,34 /&gt; Externally, the enterprise of revising Macedonia's official history and to work on the national self-image of ethnic Macedonians has negatively influenced the dynamics of the name dispute with Greece and, hence, deteriorated the international position of the country. Simultaneously, it has fostered inter-ethnic tensions and posed serious challenges for the weak multicultural society.&lt;ref&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with regard to home affairs, antiquization seems to have fulfilled its purpose. VMRO-DPMNE wins elections on a regular basis, which, according to Brunnbauer do not entirely meet European standards of fairness, but still represent a realistic picture of the political preferences in the country.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,31 /&gt; To the strong criticism of antiquization, the Macedonian government and its proponents replied by defending their indentitarian policies and by further fortifying antiquization.&lt;ref name=Vangeli25 /&gt;
	
Yet, critics warn about increasing ethnic and other social fissures and a growing fragmentation of the relatively unstable society.&lt;ref name=Spaskovska /&gt; Again others consider a continuing blockade of Macedonia's European integration as the country's main threat, as they regard the European integration as the only option for keeping the Macedonian state together and avoiding its disintegration.&lt;ref name=Gromes163 /&gt;

Surveys from the Institute of Social Sciences and Humanities Skopje (ISSHS) on the effects of Skopje 2014 on the perceptions of the population of Skopje revealed a high degree of uncertainty regarding their national identity. In a poll asking people to choose the historical period that defines the Macedonian national identity, the breakdown of responses was as follows: Independence (from 1991) 13%; enlightenment period (19th century) 26%; the revolutionary period (beginning of the 20th century) 31%; SFRY 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Social Sciences and Humanities -Skopje (2013): Skopje 2014 Project and its Effects on the Perception of Macedonian Identity Among the Citizens of Skopje.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the results of a supplementary national poll, carried out by ISSHS in September 2013, only 5.8% of the general population viewed antiquity as a historically and culturally defining period for Macedonia, whereas among ethnic Macedonians the result was 7.6%. “These results show that there is a great discrepancy between the population’s sentiment and the narrative the Government seeks to promote”.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Argiletum''' ({{lang-it|Argileto}}) was the main route approaching the [[Forum Romanum]] from the northeast in the ancient city of [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="jr1992"&gt;{{cite book|author= L. Richardson, jr|title= A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;pg=PA39|date= 1 October 1992|publisher= JHU Press|isbn= 978-0-8018-4300-6|pages= 39–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It connected the Forum with the [[Suburra|Subura]] district of the city. As it originally passed between [[Comitium]] and [[Basilica Aemilia|Basilica Pauli]], the Argiletum was eventually absorbed by the construction of the [[imperial fora]] from the time of [[Julius Caesar]] onwards.  Given this encroachment, the limits of the Argiletum were defined differently in various periods. By the time of [[Martial]] (died ca 103 CE) the Argiletum had become a seedy district filled with taverns and brothels.&lt;ref&gt;Martial 1.2.7-8; 1.3.1; 1.117.9-12; 2.17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Livy]] indicates that the temple of [[Janus Geminus|Ianus Geminus]] was located ''ad infimum Argiletum'' (Liv. 1.19.1).&lt;ref name="OvidKeightley1848"&gt;{{cite book|author1= Ovid|author2= Thomas Keightley|title= Ovid's Fasti; with introduction, notes, and excursus.

(1450 - 1475)]]

'''Bagoas''' ({{lang-peo|𐎲𐎦𐎡}} ''Bagoi'', {{lang-grc|Βαγώας}} ''Bagōas'') was a [[eunuch]] in the court of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in the 4th Century BC. Bagoas was a eunuch, a courtier of [[Darius III|Darius]]&lt;ref&gt;...with whom Darius was intimate and with whom Alexander would later be intimate... "[[Quintus Curtius Rufus]]"(Book 6.5.23)&lt;/ref&gt; and later of [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;For when he had honoured
all the friends of the king with gifts beyond their highest hopes, to Bagoas, a eunuch who had won the regard of Alexander through prostitution, he paid no honor, and on being admonished by some that Bagoas was dear to 
Alexander, replied that he was honouring the friends of the king, not his harlots, and that it was not the custom of the Persians to mate with males who made females of themselves by prostitution. "[[Quintus Curtius Rufus]]"(Book 10.1.25-27)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bagoas' kiss==
According to [[Plutarch]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 67&lt;/ref&gt; Bagoas won a dancing contest after the Macedonian crossing of the [[Gedrosia|Gedrosian Desert]]. The Macedonian troops, with whom Bagoas was very popular, demanded that king Alexander should kiss Bagoas, and he did so. 

==Fictionalized versions==
* Bagoas is the narrator and title character of ''[[The Persian Boy]]'', the [[historical novel]] by [[Mary Renault]], which portrays him sympathetically. He reappears in a smaller but still significant role in the sequel [[Funeral Games (novel)|''Funeral Games'']].
* He makes an even briefer appearance in ''Les Conquêtes d'Alexandre'' by Roger Peyrefitte. Peyrefitte, unlike Mary Renault, has Bagoas riding to battle by the side of Darius.
*He is also a major character in [[Jo Graham]]'s novel ''Stealing Fire'', part of her Numinous World series. Graham's Bagoas is basically the same as Mary Renault's, except that he is more willing to find a new lover after the death of Alexander the great.
* He is played by [[Francisco Bosch]] in the [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'' (2004), which is based in part on  Renault's writings.

'''Balkar and Karachai nationalism''' is the national sentiment among the [[Balkars]] and [[Karachai]]. It generally manifests itself in:

*The movement for the recognition of the 1944 deportations (where the Balkars and Karachai, along with the Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingush and later Estonians, Latvians and Volga Germans were deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan, with considerable portions of the nation massacred by Russian troops and historical documents burned in mass fires) as a genocide against the nation.&lt;ref name=Balkarnationalism&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=28694&amp;t=Balkar+Activists+Demand+%27Self-Determination%27|title=Balkar Activists Demand 'Self-Determination'|author=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=9 March 2010|accessdate=7 April 2010|publisher=SperoNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=genocidaldeportation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Balkars_Commemorate_Deportation_To_Central_Asia/1978051.html|title=Balkars Commemorate Deportation To Central Asia|author=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=8 March 2010|accessdate=7 April 2010|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The movement to separate [[Kabardino-Balkaria]] into Kabardin and Balkar administrative units

==Historical context==

===The 1944 Deportations and their effect on the modern movement===
{{see also|Population transfer in the Soviet Union}}
In 1943 and 1944, the Balkars and Karachais were deported ''en masse'' to Central Asia, as were the Chechens, Ingush and Kalmyks. All groups were accused of "collaboration with the Nazis".&lt;ref name=campaign&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1059069.html|title=Russia: Balkars Launch New Campaign For Own Republic|author=Liz Fuller|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=31 May 2005|accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ghostdeportation&gt;King, Charles. ''The Ghost of Freedom: A History of the Caucasus''. Oxford, 2010 (updated version). p196-198&lt;/ref&gt;

After the deportation, as happened to the other victims, the Balkars and Karachais were stripped of all political recognition of their territories. The [[Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was renamed to the [[Kabardin ASSR]], while the [[Karachay Autonomous Oblast]] was completely wiped of the map and partitioned into territories given to the [[Cherkess Autonomous Oblast]], [[Stavropol Krai]], [[Krasnodar krai]]&lt;ref name=campaign/&gt; and the [[Georgian SSR]].&lt;ref name="Jeffrey E. Cole 2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeffrey|last=Cole|title=Ethnic Groups of Europe: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=M9fDifnkMJMC&amp;pg=PA219|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The account of the [[NKVD]] (the organization guilty of the deportation), the following statistics were given:&lt;ref name=Ediev&gt;Ediev, Dalkhat. ''Demographicheskie poteri deportirovannykh narodov SSSR''. [[Stavropol']] 2003, Table 109. Page 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wooddeport&gt;Wood, Tony.''Chechnya: The Case for Independence''. Verso: London 2007. Pages 34-39&lt;/ref&gt;

*In total, 724,297 people were sent to [[Central Asia]] ([[Siberia]] and [[Kazakhstan]]) in the airless freight trains (others, such as the Chechen [[aul]] of [[Khaibakh]], were massacred ''en masse'' instead&lt;ref name=Dunlopdeport&gt;Dunlop, John. ''Russia Confronts Chechnya: Roots of a Separatist Conflict''. Cambridge 1998. Pages 62-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gammerdeport&gt;Gammer, Moshe. ''Lone Wolf and Bear: Three Centuries of Chechen Defiance to Russian Rule''. London 2006. Page 166-171&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Peoples deported were 39,407 Balkars, 71,869 Karachai, 412,548 Chechens, 96,327 Ingush, and 104,146 Kalmyks
*According to the [[NKVD]], the average death rate of those deported was about 23.5% (144,704 people)

Many historians&lt;ref name=Wooddeport/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunlopdeport/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gammerdeport/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nekrich, ''Punished Peoples''&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned the authenticity of the NKVD report, stating that it was probably a far understatement, noting also that the figure produced by Khruschev in 1956 contradicts Beria's figure by at least 96,000 people (and stating that even Khrushchev's could have been an understatement, considering his position).

Contrary to the Soviet view of the whole nations as treacherous Nazi-collaborators, according to the official statistics, 4428 of deported Chechens, 946 Ingush, 2543 Karachai, and 1045 Balkars were veterans of the Red Army.&lt;ref name=ghostdeportation/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Chislennost' spetspereselentsev, ranee sluzhivshikh v Krasnoi Armii", reprinted in Pobol' and Polian, eds, ''Stalinskie deportatsii'', p765-66&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the appalling conditions, the Balkars and Karachais contributed greatly to the economic development of Soviet Central Asia. In 1946 there were more than 50 Karachai [[Stakhanovite movement|Stakhanovites]] and 70 Karachai shockworkers (distinctions for those who consistently overfilled their quotas) in Voroshilov District in Kyrgyzstan alone. As the Balkars and Karachais demonstrated their industriousness and patriotism, they moved into positions of greater authority, especially in Kyrgyzstan, where numerous Karachai physicists, doctors and educators could be found. So valued were the Karachais that before their departure home in 1957, authorities in both Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan offered to create an autonomous oblast for them if they agreed to stay.&lt;ref name="Walter Richmond 2008"&gt;{{cite book|first=Walter|last=Richmond|title=The Northwest Caucasus: Past, Present, Future|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=E6Z5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118|year=2008|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In exile, the Karachais and Balkars were able to obtain education for their children at a level far beyond what would have been possible in their homeland. They also integrated into the religious life of the Central Asians and many received formal Islamic training and collected private libraries of Islamic books. After their return home, they maintained ties to the religious communities they left behind. The returnees were better educated that those who remained, better versed in Islam than they had been before, and were instilled with a deep sense of indignation for the unjust and inhumane acts committed against them by the Soviet government.&lt;ref name="Walter Richmond 2008p119"&gt;{{cite book|first=Walter|last=Richmond|title=The Northwest Caucasus: Past, Present, Future|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=E6Z5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119|year=2008|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is the case with the other victims of this deportation, as well as many of the Soviet deportations as a whole, the Balkars and Karachais view it as a national tragedy, a central part of the nation's victimhood, and demand it be recognized as a genocide.&lt;ref name=campaign/&gt;

==Since 1985==

===Origins and rise===
Balkar/Karachay nationalism in its current reincarnation first became visible during the [[glasnost]] era when the [[Soviet Union]] was ruled by the reform-minded [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] although the population may have had various nationalist sentiments widely manifested among themselves before, as many of their neighbors did. At first, nationalist organizations watered down their rhetoric in order to not provoke a crackdown.

The Balkars and Karachays were relatively late compared to their neighbors in seizing autonomy and establishing visible national demands and movements, partly due to their lesser numbers and even lesser intelligentsia class. The first congresses for Balkars and Karachays were formed as late as 1991.&lt;ref name=campaign/&gt;

In general, Caucasus independence movements in the glasnost era were much more assertive and aggressive, being more similar to their Baltic counterparts which they often exchanged tactics with. In 1986, an important stepping stone was the release and popularity of the Georgian film ''Repentance'',&lt;ref name=ghostnationalism&gt;King, Charles. ''The Ghost of Freedom: A History of the Caucasus''. Oxford, 2010 (updated version). p210-221&lt;/ref&gt; which had undertones regarding the falsification of history by Moscow and the repression of nations. The film instantly became a hit across the mountains, and even more so after its politicization (leading to Shevardnadze actively protecting its director from Kremlin reprisal.&lt;ref&gt;Shevardnadze, Eduard. ''The Future Belongs to Freedom''. New York: Free Press, 1991. Pages 172 and 173&lt;/ref&gt; The film had at least 30 million viewers after its first year of release, despite being described as a mediocre film.&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Woll and Denise J. Youngblood. ''Repentance''. I.B. Tauris: London, 2001. page 91.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not long before Georgian nationalism in earnest began to make itself heard.

The second people in the Caucasus to develop a popular movement against Soviet power were the Chechens, who founded the Caucasus' first anti-Soviet group, ''Kavkaz'', in the summer of 1988.&lt;ref name=Woodnationalism&gt;Wood, Tony. ''Chechnya''. Pages 46-51.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kavkaz'' was originally disguised as an environmentalist group, perhaps earnestly, though it was agreed early on by its members that an establishment of autonomy would be the only way to secure their demands, including environmental protection. Soon, in Tbilisi, the Round Table/Free Georgia bloc was founded,. Due to the Georgians' more powerful and confident position, it was inclined to much more inflammatory and openly nationalistic rhetoric of the historian and literary critic Zviad Gamsakhurdia. As the ethnic Armenian Caucasus expert [[Georgi Derluguian]] points out, All-Union conferences, intended for national unity, accomplished the opposite. Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian intellectuals exchanged ideas with the Chechens and Georgians (and later other Caucasians), and at times even programmatic documents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgi Derluguian|Derluguian, Georgi]]. ''Bourdieu's Secret Admirer in the Caucasus''. 2005. Page 150.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a radicalization of demands of all involved groups, as they became increasingly aware of the mass dislike toward the Russian center. It also led to the accelerating spread of nationalism to other groups.

In 1989, the hugely inadequate government response to the earthquakes in Armenia and Azerbaijan triggered a mass desertion of the Soviet system in general by the Eastern Caucasian regions (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Dagestan) that had been relatively loyal previously.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The Azeri Popular Front, formed in 1989, was to become a pole to which the opposition gravitated. It's habitually theatrical activities paired with its occasional tendency to cite [[pan-Turkism|pan-Turkist]] ideology and the ethnic similarities between Azeris and the Karachays and Balkars drew the mass interest of the Balkar and Karachay public. Nonetheless, their activities remained timid. It wasn't until 1991, after Georgia and Armenia had already seceded from the Soviet Union, Dudayev had defected from the Red Army (while back in Checheno-Ingushetia the anti-Zavgayev forces were gathering power), and Azerbaijan was preparing to leave the union (only Dagestan had no plans for secession, because of its own multiethnic makeup and fragile situation), that the Balkars and Karachay began to stage their own demands.

However, as was the case with other such movements, the rhetoric was slowly stepped up, especially as, after the Russian Federation was formed, Balkars and Karachais were angered by the perception that the center in Moscow wanted to re-centralize their territory (including a possible abolition of their autonomy). This was confirmed with [[Vladimir Putin]]'s actions in 2000, and his explicitly stated policy advocating "enlargement of regions of Russia".&lt;ref name="Mironov"&gt;http://english.pravda.ru/russia/36281-1&lt;/ref&gt;  Sergei Mironov stated on March 30, 2002 that "89 federation subjects is too much, but larger regional units are easier to manage" and that the goal was to merge them into 7 federal districts. Gradually, over time, ethnic republics were to be abolished to accomplish this goal of integration.&lt;ref name="Mironov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="therapeutic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.natpress.net/stat.php%3Fid%3D5228&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;twu=1&amp;usg=ALkJrhigIzHlEllhT7qt7I7JeYomtwmifg|title=Journal of RBC: The Kremlin once again pondered the enlargement of regions|author=Anastasia Matveeva, Maxim Momot|publisher=Adygea NatPress|date=2 April 2010|accessdate=6 April 2010}}  Available, translated from Russian to English by Google: http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.natpress.net/stat.php%3Fid%3D5228&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;twu=1&amp;usg=ALkJrhigIzHlEllhT7qt7I7JeYomtwmifg&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Federation era===
The Balkars are often seen as being much more overtly active than the Karachay, due to their lack of representation in the republican government (the Karachay are the dominant group in most of Karachay–Cherkessia while Balkars are a minority in Kabardino-Bakaria). Karachay nationalists, as many Cherkess activists moan (see [[Circassian nationalism]]), recently have been increasingly present and arguably influential in the government of Karachay–Cherkessia (often at the expense of Cherkess members), so there is less need for open protesting and other such activities.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In 1992, however, when the Karachay launched a massive autonomist campaign, and Boris Yeltsin eventually "suggested" a split of the Karachey-Cherkess republic into two ethnic republics. However, at that time, the control of the republic was still in the hands of Russians and Cherkess, who, in a moment of unity (one of the very last instances of good relations between the Russians and Circassians in the republic, who are often bitterly resentful of each other), quickly scrapped the bill, provoking the rage of the Karachay populace. However, at this point, the Karachay were more or less politically incapable of retaliating.&lt;ref name=campaign/&gt; This and the subsequent repression of Karachay aspirations is seen by some to be an important precursor to the fierce later repression of Cherkess irridentism by the Karachay-led government, which even resorted to historical-based attacks on Circassian nationalism (questioning the Circassian ethnicity of the man who first scaled Elbrus). Others, however, see it as "artificial tensions" created by puppet governments (be they run by ethnic Cherkess or by Karachay) of Moscow.

Many people, ranging from Circassian activist coordinators to [[Akhmed Zakayev]], Ichkerian head of government-in-exile to the liberal journalist Fatima Tlisova have speculated that Russia has tried to use a policy of divide and rule throughout the North Caucasus (citing examples of the Circassian vs. Karachai/Balkar rivalry, [[Ossetian-Ingush]] conflict, [[Georgian-Abkhaz conflict]], [[Georgian-Ossetian conflict]], interethnic rivalries in Dagestan and even the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], which Russia also insists on mediating), creating "unnatural conflicts" that can only be solved by Kremlin intervention, keeping Caucasian peoples both weak and dependent on Russia to mediate their conflicts.&lt;ref name=protestcancelled&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews[swords]=8fd5893941d69d0be3f378576261ae3e&amp;tx_ttnews[any_of_the_words]=Olympics%20Jarkasi&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=35777&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=7&amp;cHash=a2cdfa7acb|title=Circassians in Karachaevo-Cherkessia Plan Mass Protest|author=Fatima Tlisova|date=25 November 2009|work=Eurasia Daily Monitor Volume: 6 Issue: 218|publisher=The Jamestown Foundation|accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sufian Jemukhov and Alexei Bekshokov, leaders of the "Circassian Sports Initiative" stated that the conflict "has the potential to blow up the whole Caucasus into a bloody mess with the mass civilian casualties and therefore keep the Circassians from opposing the Sochi Winter Olympics...Moscow plays the conflict scenario when the participants do not have the ability to solve the conflict, but the conflict is absolutely manageable and can be easily solved by its rulers from the Kremlin."&lt;ref name=protestcancelled/&gt;

In 1996, the Kabardin-Balkar republic's Kremlin-installed government responded to demands to split the republic in two with mass arrests and repression.&lt;ref name=campaign/&gt;

===Genocide recognition campaign===
The campaign for the recognition of the genocide is a central tenet and article of faith for Balkar and Karachay activists. It embodies the sense of persecution and loneliness felt by the Balkar and Karachay populace.

Karachai and Balkar nationalists often hold rallies on the "genocide anniversary".&lt;ref name=genocidaldeportation/&gt; On March 8, 2010, one such rally in Nal'chik (Kabardino-Balkaria) attracted hundreds of protesters, demanding "self-determination" for the Balkar people, claiming the Kabardin and Russian dominated parliament did nothing to address their woes.&lt;ref name=Balkarnationalism/&gt; The rally drew some protest from the Russian population (calling it "separatist" and "subversive") and from the local government.

In 2010, in a conciliatory move (an attempt to defuse the three-way tensions between Russians, Circassians and Balkars in Kabardino-Balkaria), President Kanokov of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic recognized the deportations as [[genocide]], echoing statements made by the Chechen separatist government, Estonia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6959632.stm | work=BBC News | title=Estonian man on genocide charge | date=23 August 2007 | accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/Top_News/2009-03-28/Estonian_Red_Army_veteran_dies_amidst_genocide_trial.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612063830/http://rt.com/news/estonian-red-army-veteran-dies-amidst-genocide-trial/ |archivedate=2013-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a memorial at Vilna in Lithuania&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/odlin1/Graphics/lith/lithgen.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911160640/http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/odlin1/Graphics/lith/lithgen.htm |archivedate=2006-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in solidarity with the Balkars and Karachai people as fellow deportation victims.&lt;ref name=Balkarnationalism/&gt;

'''María Ana "Bambi" L. Harper''' is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] cultural writer and socialite who was a former President of the [[Heritage Conservation Society of the Philippines]], and a columnist for the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' with  "Sense and Sensibility", which focuses on Philippine cultural history. In 2008, she became [[Intramuros Administration|7th Administrator]] of the historic [[Intramuros]] district of [[Manila]].

== Controversy ==
In early September 2008, it was reported that administrative charges could be leveled against Harper for having allowed the cutting of 29 trees, including nine [[mahogany]] and [[flame trees]] at the [[Plaza de Roma]] fronting [[Manila Cathedral]].

The [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources (Philippines)|Department of Environment and Natural Resources]] reported that Harper, as head of the [[Intramuros|Intramuros Administration]], sought a permit in May 2008 to remove trees at the park so that the area could be landscaped and developed and to "replace [the trees] with historically appropriate trees which would not block the facade of Manila Cathedral."

Harper responded that she had not ordered the trees cut, but rather asked a contractor to move the trees to another part of the park. She said that a subordinate had mistakenly given approval for the trees to be cut.

'''Baroque painting''' is the [[painting]] associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]]. The movement is often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]], the [[Counter Reformation]] and Catholic Revival,&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=2008-12-11 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; but the existence of important Baroque art and [[Baroque architecture|architecture]] in non-absolutist and [[Protestant]] states throughout Western Europe underscores its widespread popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, "Gardner's Art Through the Ages" (Belmont, California: [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque painting encompasses a great range of styles, as most important and major painting during the period beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century, and into the early 18th century is identified today as [[Baroque]] painting. In its most typical manifestations, Baroque art is characterized by great drama, rich, deep colour, and intense light and dark shadows, but the [[classicism]] of French Baroque painters like [[Poussin]] and Dutch [[genre painters]] such as [[Vermeer]] are also covered by the term, at least in English.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in French calling Poussin Baroque would be generally rejected&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to [[Renaissance art]], which usually showed the moment before an event took place, Baroque artists chose the most dramatic point, the moment when the action was occurring: [[Michelangelo]], working in the [[High Renaissance]], shows his [[David (Michelangelo)|David]] composed and still before he battles [[Goliath]]; [[Bernini]]'s Baroque [[David (Bernini)|David]] is caught in the act of hurling the stone at the giant. Baroque art was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance.

Among the greatest painters of the [[Baroque]] period are [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Caravaggio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=Caravaggio&amp;role=&amp;nation=&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=500115312 |title=Getty profile, including variant spellings of the artist's name |publisher=Getty.edu |date=2002-12-11 |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]],&lt;ref name="Gombrich, p. 420"&gt;Gombrich, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]],&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 11–18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]],&lt;ref&gt;His ''Lives of the Painters'' was published in Rome, 1672.  Poussin's other contemporary biographer was [[André Félibien]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vermeer]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Liedtke (2007) Dutch Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 867.&lt;/ref&gt; Caravaggio is an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.  Baroque painting often dramatizes scenes using [[chiaroscuro]] light effects; this can be seen in works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, [[Le Nain]] and [[Georges de La Tour|La Tour]].
The Flemish painter [[Anthony van Dyck]] developed a graceful but imposing portrait style that was very influential, especially in England.

The prosperity of 17th century Holland led to an enormous production of art by large numbers of painters who were mostly highly specialized and painted only [[genre painting|genre scenes]], [[Landscape art|landscapes]], [[Still-life]]s, [[portrait]]s or [[History painting]]s.  Technical standards were very high, and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] established a new repertoire of subjects that was very influential until the arrival of [[Modernism]].

[[File:JosefaObidos1.jpg|thumb|[[Nativity of Jesus|''Nativity'']] by [[Josefa de Óbidos]], 1669, [[National Museum of Ancient Art]], [[Lisbon]]]]
The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–63), in which the [[Roman Catholic Church]] answered many questions of internal reform raised by both [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and by those who had remained inside the Catholic Church, [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|addressed the representational arts]] in a short and somewhat oblique passage in its decrees.  This was subsequently interpreted and expounded by a number of clerical authors like [[Molanus]], who demanded that [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s in church contexts should depict their subjects clearly and powerfully, and with decorum, without the stylistic airs of [[Mannerism]].
This return toward a [[Populism|populist]] conception of the function of ecclesiastical art is seen by many [[Art history|art historians]] as driving the innovations of [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]] and the [[The Carracci|Carracci]] brothers, all of whom were working (and competing for commissions) in Rome around 1600, although unlike the Carracci, Caravaggio persistently was criticised for lack of decorum in his work.
However, although [[sacred art|religious painting]], [[history painting]], [[allegories]], and [[portraits]] were still considered the most noble subjects, [[Landscape art|landscape]], [[still life]], and genre scenes were also becoming more common in Catholic countries, and were the main genres in Protestant ones.

===The term===
The term "Baroque" was initially used with a derogatory meaning, to underline the excesses of its emphasis. Others derive it from the mnemonic term "Baroco" denoting, in logical ''Scholastica'', a supposedly laboured form of [[syllogism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Panofsky | first=Erwin | title=What is Baroque? |  journal=Three Essays on Style| publisher=The MIT Press | year=1995 | pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, the term was used to describe its eccentric redundancy and noisy abundance of details, which sharply contrasted the clear and sober rationality of the Renaissance.  It was first rehabilitated by the [[Switzerland|Swiss-born]] [[Art History|art historian]], [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945) in his ''Renaissance und Barock'' (1888); Wölfflin identified the Baroque as "movement imported into mass", an art antithetic to [[Renaissance]] art. He did not make the distinctions between [[Mannerism]] and Baroque that modern writers do, and he ignored the later phase, the academic Baroque that lasted into the 18th century. Writers in French and English did not begin to treat Baroque as a respectable study until Wölfflin's influence had made German scholarship pre-eminent.

==National variations==
Led by Italy, Mediterranean countries, slowly followed by most of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in Germany and [[Central Europe]], generally adopted a full-blooded Baroque approach. 

A rather different art developed out of northern realist traditions in 17th century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], which had very little religious art, and little [[history painting]], instead playing a crucial part in developing secular genres such as [[still life]], [[genre painting]]s of everyday scenes, and [[landscape painting]].  While the Baroque nature of Rembrandt's art is clear, the label is less use for [[Vermeer]] and many other Dutch artists.  Most Dutch art lacks the idealization and love of splendour typical of much Baroque work, including the neighbouring [[Flemish Baroque painting]] which shared a part in Dutch trends, while also continuing to produce the traditional categories in a more clearly Baroque style.

In France a dignified and graceful classicism gave a distinctive flavour to Baroque painting, where the later 17th century is also regarded as a golden age for painting.  Two of the most important artists, [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Claude Lorrain]], remained based in Rome, where their work, almost all in [[easel painting]]s, was much appreciated by Italian as well as French patrons.

Big History arose from a desire to go beyond the specialized and self-contained fields that emerged in the 20th century. It tries to grasp history as a whole, looking for common themes across multiple time scales in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History |first=David |last=Christian |page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Changing Image of the Sciences |first=Ida H. |last=Stamhuis |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional history typically begins with the invention of writing, and is limited to past events relating directly to the [[human race]]. Big Historians point out that this limits study to the past 5,000 years and neglects the much longer time when humans existed on Earth. Henry Kannberg sees Big History as being a product of the [[Information Age]], a stage in history itself following speech, writing, and printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Kannberg| first1=Henry| title=Optimism| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/197069825/OPTIMISM-optitunity| website=Scribd| accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big History covers the formation of the universe, stars, and galaxies, and includes the beginning of life as well as the period of several hundred thousand years when humans were hunter-gatherers. It sees the transition to civilization as a gradual one, with many causes and effects, rather than an abrupt transformation from uncivilized static cavemen to dynamic civilized farmers.&lt;ref name=tws2M23/&gt; An account in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' describes what it [[polemic]]ally asserts to be the conventional "history" view:

{{Quote|Early humans were slump-shouldered, slope-browed, hairy brutes. They hunkered over campfires and ate scorched meat. Sometimes they carried [[spear]]s. Once in a while they scratched pictures of [[antelope]]s on the walls of their caves. That's what I learned during elementary school, anyway. History didn't start with the first humans - they were [[cavemen]]! The [[Stone Age]] wasn't history; the Stone Age was a preamble to history, a [[dystopia]]n era of stasis before the happy onset of civilization, and the arrival of nifty developments like chariot wheels, gunpowder, and Google. History started with agriculture, nation-states, and written documents. History began in [[Mesopotamia]]'s [[Fertile Crescent]], somewhere around 4000 BC. It began when we finally overcame our savage legacy, and culture surpassed biology.|Anthony Doerr reviewing ''On Deep History and the Brain'' by Daniel Lord Smail, 2007&lt;ref name=tws2M23&gt;{{cite news

Big History, in contrast to conventional history, has more of an interdisciplinary basis.&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; Advocates sometimes view conventional history as "microhistory" or "shallow history", and note that three-quarters of historians specialize in understanding the last 250 years while ignoring the "long march of human existence."&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; However, one historian disputed that the discipline of history has overlooked the big view, and described the "grand narrative" of Big History as a "cliché that gets thrown around a lot."&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; One account suggested that conventional history had the "sense of grinding the nuts into an ever finer powder."&lt;ref name=tws2M14&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explores the mix of individual action and social and environmental forces, according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; While conventional history might see an invention such as sharper spear points as being deliberately created by some smart humans, and then copied by other humans, a Big History perspective might see sharper spear points as accidental, and then natural evolutionary processes enabled their users to be better hunters, even if they did not understand why this was the case.&lt;ref name=tws2M22/&gt; It seeks to discover repeating patterns during the 13.8 billion years since the Big Bang.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; For example, one pattern is that "chaos catalyzes creativity", such as the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|asteroid impact]] wiping out the dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt;

===Time scales and questions===
Big History makes comparisons based on different time scales, or what David Christian calls "the play of scales", and notes similarities and differences between the human, geological, and cosmological scales. Christian believes such "radical shifts in perspective" will yield "new insights into familiar historical problems, from the [[nature versus nurture|nature/nurture debate]] to [[environmental history]] to the fundamental nature of change itself."&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; It shows how human existence has been changed by both human-made and natural factors: for example, according to natural processes which happened more than four billion years ago, [[iron]] emerged from the remains of an exploding star and, as a result, humans could use this hard metal to forge weapons for hunting and war.&lt;ref name=tws2M11/&gt; The discipline addresses such questions as "How did we get here?," "How do we decide what to believe?," "How did Earth form?," and "What is life?"&lt;ref name=tws2M31/&gt; It offers a "grand tour of all the major scientific paradigms."&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; According to one view, it helps students to become [[scientific literacy|scientifically literate]] quickly.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;

===Cosmic evolution===
{{Nature timeline}}
[[Cosmic Evolution (book)|Cosmic evolution]], the scientific study of universal change, is closely related to Big History (as are the allied subjects of the [[epic of evolution]] and [[astrobiology]]); some researchers regard cosmic evolution as broader than Big History since the latter mainly (and rightfully) examines the specific historical trek from Big Bang → [[Milky Way]] → Sun → Earth → humanity. Cosmic evolution, while fully addressing all complex systems (and not merely those that led to humans), which is also sometimes called cosmological history or [[universal history]], has been taught and researched for decades, mostly by [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[astrophysics|astrophysicists]]. This Big-Bang-to-humankind scenario well preceded the subject that some historians began calling Big History in the 1990s. Cosmic evolution is an intellectual framework that offers a grand synthesis of the many varied changes in the assembly and composition of radiation, matter, and life throughout the history of the universe. While engaging the time-honored queries of who we are and whence we came, this interdisciplinary subject attempts to unify the sciences within the entirety of [[natural history]]—a single, inclusive scientific narrative of the origin and evolution of all material things over ~14 billion years, from the origin of the universe to the present day on Earth.

The roots of the idea of cosmic evolution extend back millennia. Ancient Greek philosophers of the fifth century BCE, most notably [[Heraclitus]], are celebrated for their reasoned claims that all things change. Early modern speculation about cosmic evolution began more than a century ago, including the broad insights of [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[Lawrence Henderson]]. Only in the mid-20th century was the cosmic-evolutionary scenario articulated as a research paradigm to include empirical studies of galaxies, stars, planets, and life—in short, an expansive agenda that combines physical, biological, and cultural evolution. [[Harlow Shapley]] widely articulated the idea of cosmic evolution (often calling it "[[cosmography]]") in public venues at mid-century,&lt;ref&gt;Palmeri, J., "Bringing Cosmos to Culture: Harlow Shapley and the Uses of Cosmic Evolution," in ''Cosmos &amp; Culture: Cultural Evolution in a Cosmic Context'', Dick, S.J and Lupsella, M.L. (eds.), NASA SP4802, Washington, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-16-083119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NASA]] embraced it in the late 20th century as part of its more limited [[astrobiology]] program. [[Carl Sagan]],&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, C., ''[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]]'', Random House, 1980, {{ISBN|0-394-50294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Chaisson]],&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E., ''Cosmic Dawn: The Origins of Matter and Life'', [[Atlantic Monthly]]/[[Little, Brown]], 1981, {{ISBN|0-316-13590-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hubert Reeves]],&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, H., ''Patience dans l'azur: L'evolution cosmique'', [[Éditions du Seuil]], 1981&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erich Jantsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Jantsch, E., ''The Self-Organizing Universe'', [[Pergamon Press|Pergamon]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Preston Cloud]],&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, P., ''Cosmos, Earth, and Man'', [[Yale Univ. Press]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; among others, extensively championed cosmic evolution at roughly the same time around 1980. This extremely broad subject now continues to be richly formulated as both a technical research program and a scientific worldview for the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674009875&amp;content=reviews ''Cosmic Evolution: Rise of Complexity in Nature''], [[Harvard Univ. Press]], 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00987-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick, S.J., and Lupsella, M.L., ''Cosmos &amp; Culture: Cultural Evolution in a Cosmic Context'', NASA SP4802, Washington, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-16-083119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick, S. and Strick, J., ''The Living Universe'', [[Rutgers University Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0-8135-3733-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmic evolution can elicit controversy for several reasons: [[evolution]] of any kind inherently attracts detractors, especially among religious [[fundamentalists]]; cosmic evolution addresses universal and human origins, which often elevate emotions; it challenges age-old ideas about life's sense of place in the cosmos; it embraces change, which many people dislike or distrust; it welcomes a broad interpretation of the concept of evolution, replacing the idea of evolution exclusive to life, which some biologists prefer; it proposes a sweeping, interdisciplinary worldview based on [[rationality]] and [[empiricism]], which, despite its experimental tests, some find intellectually arrogant.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

One popular collection of scholarly materials on cosmic evolution is based on teaching and research that has been underway at [[Harvard University]] since the mid-1970s&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/AnthologyBH_article.pdf "Researching and Teaching Cosmic Evolution,"] in ''From Big Bang to Global Civilization: A Big History Anthology'', Rodriguez, Grinin, Korotayev, (eds.), [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity, energy, thresholds===
Cosmic evolution is a quantitative subject, whereas big history typically is not; this is because cosmic evolution is practiced mostly by natural scientists, while big history by social scholars. These two subjects, closely allied and overlapping, benefit from each other; cosmic evolutionists tend to treat universal history linearly, thus humankind enters their story only at the most very recent times, whereas big historians tend to stress humanity and its many cultural achievements, granting human beings a larger part of their story. One can compare and contrast these different emphases by watching two short movies portraying the Big-Bang-to-humankind narrative, one animating time linearly, and the other  capturing time (actually look-back time) logarithmically; in the former, humans enter this 14-minute movie in the last second, while in the latter we appear much earlier—yet both are correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_intro_movies.html|title=Cosmic Evolution - Intro to Movies|author=|date=|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_intro_movies.html|title=Cosmic Evolution - Intro to Movies|author=|date=|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These different treatments of time over ~14 billion years, each with different emphases on historical content, are further clarified by noting that some cosmic evolutionists divide the whole narrative into three phases and seven epochs:
::'''Phases''': physical evolution → biological evolution → cultural evolution
::'''Epochs''': particulate → galactic → stellar → planetary → chemical → biological → cultural
This contrasts with the approach used by some big historians who divide the narrative into many more thresholds, as noted in the discussion at the end of this section below. Yet another telling of the Big-Bang-to-humankind story is one that emphasizes the earlier universe, particularly the growth of particles, galaxies, and large-scale cosmic structure, such as in [[physical cosmology]].

Notable among quantitative efforts to describe cosmic evolution are [[Eric Chaisson]]'s research efforts to describe the concept of energy flow through open, [[thermodynamic]] systems, including galaxies, stars, planets, life, and society.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674009875&amp;content=reviews ''Cosmic Evolution: Rise of Complexity in Nature''], Harvard Univ. Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00987-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_I_FINAL_2011.pdf "Energy Rate Density as a Complexity Metric and Evolutionary Driver,"] ''Complexity'', Vol. 16, p.27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_II_galley_2011.pdf "Energy Rate Density. II. Probing Further a New Complexity Metric,"] ''Complexity'', Vol. 17, p.44, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The observed increase of [[energy rate density]] (energy/time/mass) among a whole host of complex systems is one useful way to explain the rise of complexity in an [[expanding universe]] that still obeys the cherished [[second law of thermodynamics]] and thus continues to accumulate net [[entropy]]. As such, ordered material systems—from buzzing bees and redwood trees to shining stars and thinking beings—are viewed as temporary, local islands of order in a vast, global sea of disorder. A recent review article, which is especially directed toward big historians, summarizes much of this empirical effort over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/big_history_review_Chaisson_TSWJ2014.pdf "The Natural Science Underlying Big History,"] ''The Scientific World Journal'', v. 2014, 41 pgs, 2014; DOI:10.1155/2014/384912.&lt;/ref&gt;

One striking finding of such complexity studies is the apparently ranked order among all known material systems in the universe. Although the ''absolute'' energy in astronomical systems greatly exceeds that of humans, and although the mass densities of stars, planets, bodies, and brains are all comparable, the energy rate ''density'' for humans and modern human society are approximately a million times greater than for stars and galaxies. For example, the Sun emits a vast luminosity, 4x10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s (equivalent to nearly a billion billion billion watt light bulb), but it also has a huge mass, 2x10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; g; thus each second an amount of energy equaling only 2 ergs passes through each gram of this star. In contrast to any star, more energy flows through each gram of a plant's leaf during photosynthesis, and much more (nearly a million times) rushes through each gram of a human brain while thinking (~20W/1350g).&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/unifying_concept_for_astrobio.pdf "A unifying concept for astrobiology,"] ''International Journal of Astrobiology'', Vol. 2, p.91, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmic evolution is more than a subjective, qualitative assertion of "one damn thing after another". This inclusive scientific worldview constitutes an objective, quantitative approach toward deciphering much of what comprises organized, material Nature. Its uniform, consistent philosophy of approach toward all complex systems demonstrates that the basic differences, both within and among many varied systems, are of degree, not of kind. And, in particular, it suggests that optimal ranges of energy rate density grant opportunities for the evolution of complexity; those systems able to adjust, adapt, or otherwise take advantage of such energy flows survive and prosper, while other systems adversely affected by too much or too little energy are non-randomly eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/ASUessay_revised_for_CUP.pdf "Using Complexity Science to Search for Unity in the Natural Sciences,"] in ''Complexity and the Arrow of Time: What is Complexity?'', Lineweaver, Davies and Ruse (eds.), [[Cambridge Univ. Press]], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fred Spier is foremost among those big historians who have found the concept of energy flows useful, suggesting that Big History is the rise and demise of complexity on all scales, from sub-microscopic particles to vast galaxy clusters, and not least many biological and cultural systems in between.&lt;ref&gt;Spier, F., ''Big History and the Future of Humanity'', [[Wiley-Blackwell]], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian describes each stage in the progression towards greater complexity as a "threshold moment" when things become more complex, but they also become more fragile and mobile.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt; Some of Christian's threshold stages are:

[[File:SN 1997D.jpg|thumb|right|In a [[supernova]], a star which has exhausted most of its energy bursts in an incredible explosion, creating conditions for heavier elements such as [[iron]] and [[gold]] to form.]]
# The universe appears, incredibly hot, busting, expanding, within a second.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Stars are born.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Stars die, creating temperatures hot enough to make complex chemicals, as well as rocks, asteroids, planets, moons, and our solar system.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Earth is created.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Life appears on Earth, with molecules growing from the [[Goldilocks conditions]], with neither too much nor too little energy.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Humans appear, language, collective learning.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

Christian elaborated that more complex systems are more fragile, and that while collective learning is a powerful force to advance humanity in general, it is not clear that humans are in charge of it, and it is possible in his view for humans to destroy the [[biosphere]] with the powerful weapons that have been invented.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

In the 2008 lecture series through ''[[The Great Courses|The Teaching Company's Great Courses]]'' entitled ''Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity'', Christian explains Big History in terms of eight thresholds of increasing complexity:&lt;ref name=ttc&gt;{{cite book

A theme in Big History is what has been termed Goldilocks conditions or the [[Goldilocks principle]], which describes how "circumstances must be right for any type of complexity to form or continue to exist," as emphasized by Spier in his recent book.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; For humans, bodily temperatures can neither be too hot nor too cold; for life to form on a planet, it can neither have too much nor too little energy from sunlight. Stars require sufficient quantities of [[hydrogen]], sufficiently packed together under tremendous gravity, to cause [[nuclear fusion]].&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;

Christian suggests that the universe creates complexity when these Goldilocks conditions are met, that is, when things are not too hot or cold, not too fast or slow. For example, life began not in solids (molecules are stuck together, preventing the right kinds of associations) or gases (molecules move too fast to enable favorable associations) but in liquids such as water which permitted the right kinds of interactions at the right speeds.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

Somewhat in contrast, [[Eric Chaisson|Chaisson]] has maintained for well more than a decade that "organizational complexity is mostly governed by the ''optimum'' use of energy—not too little as to starve a system, yet not too much as to destroy it" (italics in the original published paper&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/complexity_santafe_j.pdf "Complexity: An Energetics Agenda,"] ''Complexity'', v9, p14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;). Neither maximum energy principles nor minimum entropy states are likely relevant, and appeals to "Goldilocks principles" (or other such fairy tales) are unnecessary to appreciate the emergence of complexity in Nature writ large.

===Other themes===
[[File:FISHtechniqueInt.JPG|thumb|right|Big Historians use information based on scientific techniques such as [[gene mapping]] to learn more about the origins of humanity.]]
Advances in particular sciences such as [[archaeology]], [[gene mapping]], and [[evolutionary ecology]] have enabled historians to gain new insights into the early origins of humans, despite the lack of written sources.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; One account suggested that proponents of Big History were trying to "upend" the conventional practice in [[historiography]] of relying on written records.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt;

Big History proponents suggest that humans have been affecting [[climate change]] throughout history, by such methods as [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture, although past modifications have been on a lesser scale than in recent years during the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt;

A book by Daniel Lord Smail in 2008 suggested that history was a continuing process of humans learning to self-modify our mental states by using stimulants such as [[coffee]] and [[tobacco]], as well as other means such as [[religious rite]]s or [[romance novel]]s.&lt;ref name=tws2M22&gt;{{cite news

===Presentation by web-based interactive video===
[[File:ChronoZoom Timeline Project.jpg|thumb|[[ChronoZoom]] is a free open source project that helps readers visualize time at all scales from the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago to the present.]]
Big History is more likely than conventional history to be taught with interactive "video-heavy" websites without textbooks, according to one account.&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; The discipline has benefited from having new ways of presenting themes and concepts in new formats, often supplemented by Internet and computer technology.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; For example, the [[ChronoZoom]] project is a way to explore the 14 billion year history of the universe in an interactive website format.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws2M18&gt;{{cite news

==History of the field==

===Early efforts===
[[File:AvHumboldt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1843]]
[[File:Carl Sagan Planetary Society.JPG|thumb|right|Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]]]]
While the emerging field of Big History in its present state is generally seen as having emerged in the past two decades beginning around 1990, there have been numerous precedents going back almost 150 years. In the mid-19th century, [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s book ''[[Cosmos (Humboldt)|Cosmos]]'', and [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers']] 1844 book ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; were seen as early precursors to the field.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In a sense, Darwin's [[theory of evolution]] was, in itself, an attempt to explain a biological phenomenon by examining longer term cause-and-effect processes. In the first half of the 20th century, secular biologist [[Julian Huxley]] originated the term "evolutionary humanism",&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; while around the same time the French Jesuit paleontologist [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] examined links between [[cosmic evolution]] and a tendency towards complexification (including human consciousness), while envisaging compatibility between cosmology, evolution, and theology. In the mid and later 20th century, ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'' by [[Jacob Bronowski]] examined history from a multidisciplinary perspective. Later, [[Eric Chaisson]] explored the subject of [[Cosmic Evolution (book)|cosmic evolution]] quantitatively in terms of [[energy rate density]], and the astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] wrote ''[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]]''.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; [[Thomas Berry]], a cultural historian, and the academic [[Brian Swimme]] explored meaning behind myths and encouraged academics to explore themes beyond [[organized religion]].&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt;
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|right|The famous ''[[Earthrise]]'' photo may have stimulated, among other things, an interest in interdisciplinary studies.]]
The field continued to evolve from interdisciplinary studies during the mid-20th century, stimulated in part by the [[Cold War]] and the [[Space Race]]. Some early efforts were courses in ''Cosmic Evolution'' at [[Harvard University]] in the [[United States]], and ''Universal History'' in the [[Soviet Union]]. One account suggested that the notable [[Earthrise]] photo, taken during a lunar orbit by the spacecraft [[Apollo 8]], which showed Earth as a small blue and white ball behind a stark and desolate lunar landscape, not only stimulated the [[environmental movement]] but also caused an upsurge of interdisciplinary interest.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; The [[France|French]] historian [[Fernand Braudel]] examined daily life with investigations of "large-scale historical forces like geology and climate".&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; Physiologist [[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' examined the interplay between geography and human evolution;&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; for example, he argued that the horizontal shape of the [[Eurasia]]n continent enabled human civilizations to advance more quickly than the vertical north-south shape of the American continent, because it enabled greater competition and information-sharing among peoples of the relatively same climate.

In the 1970s, scholars in the United States including geologist [[Preston Cloud]] of the [[University of Minnesota]], astronomer G. Siegfried Kutter at [[Evergreen State College]] in Washington state, and [[Harvard University]] astrophysicists [[George B. Field]] and [[Eric Chaisson]] started synthesizing knowledge to form a "science-based history of everything", although each of these scholars emphasized somewhat their own particular specializations in their courses and books.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In 1980, the Austrian philosopher [[Erich Jantsch]] wrote ''The Self-Organizing Universe'' which viewed history in terms of what he called "process structures".&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; There was an experimental course taught by John Mears at [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, and more formal courses at the university level began to appear.

In 1991 [[Clive Ponting]] wrote ''A Green History of the World: The Environment and the Collapse of Great Civilizations''. His analysis did not begin with the Big Bang, but his chapter "Foundations of History" explored the influences of large-scale geological and astronomical forces over a broad time period.

Sometimes the terms "Deep History" and "Big History" are interchangeable, but sometimes "Deep History" simply refers to history going back several hundred thousand years or more without the other senses of being a movement within history itself.&lt;ref name=tws2M25&gt;{{cite news

===David Christian===
One exponent is [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] of [[Macquarie University]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Christian was also affiliated with [[San Diego State University]] in [[California]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/histweb/course_syllabi/100_level_syllabi/history100_christian.pdf San Diego State University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209212647/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/histweb/course_syllabi/100_level_syllabi/history100_christian.pdf |date=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He read widely in diverse fields in science, and believed that much was missing from the general study of history. His first university-level course was offered in 1989.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; He developed a college course beginning with the [[Big Bang]] to the [[present day|present]]&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; in which he collaborated with numerous colleagues from diverse fields in science and the humanities and the social sciences. This course eventually became a [[Teaching Company]] course entitled ''Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity'', with 24 hours of lectures,&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; which appeared in 2008.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;

Since the 1990s, other universities began to offer similar courses. In 1994 at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], college courses were offered.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In 1996, Fred Spier wrote ''The Structure of Big History''.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; Spier looked at structured processes which he termed "regimes":

{{Quote|I defined a regime in its most general sense as 'a more or less regular but ultimately unstable pattern that has a certain temporal permanence', a definition which can be applied to human cultures, human and non-human physiology, non-human nature, as well as to organic and inorganic phenomena at all levels of complexity. By defining 'regime' in this way, human cultural regimes thus became a subcategory of regimes in general, and the approach allowed me to look systematically at interactions among different regimes which together produce big history.|Fred Spier, 2008&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;}}

Christian's course caught the attention of philanthropist [[Bill Gates]], who discussed with him how to turn Big History into a high school-level course. Gates said about David Christian:

{{Quote|He really blew me away. Here's a guy who's read across the sciences, humanities, and social sciences and brought it together in a single framework. It made me wish that I could have taken big history when I was young, because it would have given me a way to think about all of the school work and reading that followed. In particular, it really put the sciences in an interesting historical context and explained how they apply to a lot of contemporary concerns.|Bill Gates, in 2012&lt;ref name=tws2M31&gt;{{cite news

===Educational courses===
By 2002, a dozen college courses on Big History had sprung up around the world.&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; [[Cynthia Stokes Brown]] initiated Big History at the [[Dominican University of California]], and she wrote ''Big History: From the Big Bang to the Present.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominican.edu/dominicannews/dominican-professor-examines-big-history.html |title=Dominican Professor Examines Big History |publisher=Dominican University of California |accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Dominican University of California launched the world's first Big History program to be required of all first-year students, as part of the school's general education track. This program, directed by Mojgan Behmand, includes a one-semester survey of Big History, and an interdisciplinary second-semester course exploring the Big History metanarrative through the lens of a particular discipline or subject.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominican.edu/academics/advising/firstyearprograms/general-education-ge.html |title=General Education (GE) Requirements |publisher=Dominican University of California |date=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A course description reads:

The Dominican faculty's approach is to synthesize the disparate threads of Big History thought, in order to teach the content, develop critical thinking and writing skills, and prepare students to wrestle with the philosophical implications of the Big History metanarrative. In 2015, [[University of California Press]] published ''Teaching Big History'', a comprehensive pedagogical guide for teaching Big History, edited by Richard B. Simon, Mojgan Behmand, and Thomas Burke, and written by the Dominican faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Richard B., Mojgan Behmand, and Thomas Burke.

By 2011, 50 professors around the world have offered courses. In 2012, one report suggested that Big History was being practiced as a "coherent form of research and teaching" by hundreds of academics from different disciplines.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;

There are initiatives to make Big History a required standard course for university students throughout the world. An education project founded by [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[Bill Gates]] from his personal funds was launched in Australia and the United States, to offer a free online version of the course to high school students.&lt;ref name=tws2M11/&gt;

Currently, Big History is a consolidated academic field that is giving rise to new views and epistemological approaches, especially in [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean, whose [[decolonial]] vision of history, economics and science has opened new questions. In this sense, the [[transdisciplinary]] and [[biomimetics]] research of Javier Collado&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coevolution in the Big History - a transdisciplinary and biomimetic introduction to the Sustainable Development Goals |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |url=http://www.globaleducationmagazine.com/tesis-doctoral-Javier-Collado-Ruano-Coevoluci%C3%B3n-en-la-Gran-Historia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; represents an ecology of knowledge between scientific knowledge and the ancestral wisdom of [[native peoples]], such as [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador]]. This transdisciplinary vision integrates and unifies diverse [[episteme]]s that are in, between, and beyond the scientific disciplines, that is, it includes ancestral wisdom, [[spirituality]], [[art]], emotions, mystical experiences and other dimensions forgotten in the [[history of science]], specially by the positivist approach. In approaching the Big History from the [[complexity]] sciences, the transdisciplinary methodology seeks to understand the interconnections of the human race with the different levels of reality that co-exist in nature and in the cosmos,&lt;ref name="Bioethics"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Bioethics as a Transdisciplinary Science of Complexity: A Co-evolutionary Introduction since the Big History |journal=Revista Colombiana de Bioética |volume=11 |issue=1 |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |page=56 |url=http://www.redalyc.org/html/1892/189246655004/|year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this includes mystical and spiritual experiences, very present in the rituals of [[shamanism]] with [[ayahuasca]] and other sacred plants. The common denominator of all indigenous and aboriginal ancestral worldviews is the spiritual and ecological conception that structures their social organizations, which are in harmony and respect with the different forms of life that exist on our planet.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"/&gt; In the same way that [[Fritjof Capra]] carried out an analysis of the parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism, the teaching of the Big History in universities of [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Argentina]] is nourished by the [[worldview]] of their [[ancestor]] to analyze the parallels between the scientific discoveries and the original knowledge of the native and indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"/&gt;

'''''Chronicle of Nantes''''' (Latin: ''Chronicon Namnetense'', French: ''Chronique de Nantes'') is an eleventh-century Latin chronicle of history extending from 570 to about 1049 AD. The original manuscript, kept in the city of [[Nantes]], has not survived, but there exist: 
# a late fifteenth-century French translation of much of it, made by a certain [[Pierre Le Baud]], who inserted it in two histories of [[Brittany]] he wrote;
# Latin excerpts, which have been inserted into other chronicles. The editor of the Chronicle, René Merlet,&lt;ref&gt;Merlet, ''La chronique de Nantes'' (Paris, 1896)&lt;/ref&gt; assembled twenty additional scattered chapters he collected from other sources. 

Merlet presented reasons for dating the Chronicle of Nantes to the 1050s, and detected the presence of charters from the cathedral archives of [[Tours]] and Nantes, and annals and narratives in the unknown author's&lt;ref&gt;The plausible suggestion made by Merlet, that he was a canon of the cathedral chapter, has no documentary evidence.&lt;/ref&gt; source materials.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Douglas, ed. ''English Historical Documents'' (Routledge, 1979) "Secular Narrative Sources" pp 345f.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conall Mag Eochagáin''' (also known as '''Conall Mac Eochagáin''', and in Anglicised forms as '''Conall MacGeoghegan''',  also known as '''Conall Mac Geoghegan''') ''fl.'' 1620-1640, head of his lineage, was a historian and translator from Lismoyny, Co. [[Westmeath]]. In 1627, he translated ''[[Annals of Clonmacnoise]]'' into English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=Robert|title=The Concise Oxford Companion to Irish Literature$ The Concise Oxford Companion to Irish Literature|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus gaining him the title '''"Conall the Historian" '''.

==Biography==

===Family===
Mag Eochagáinn was a direct [[Geoghegan]] descendent of [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]] – specifically from the branch of [[Fiachu mac Néill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Hart|first1=John|title=Irish Pedigrees: Or, The Origin and Stem of the Irish Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His paternal grandmother, Gyles "Shiela" O'Dempsey was sister to [[Terence O'Dempsey, 1st Viscount Clanmalier]].

It is speculated that he was born in 1592, in Lismoyny (Co. Westmeath), near [[Clara, County Offaly|Clara]], [[Co. Offaly]], to Anne Fitzgerald (or Fitz Thomas; ''d.'' 1580), and Neal/Niall Mag Eochagáin, brother of [[Roche MacGeoghegan]].

His wife is thought to have been Margaret Coughlin – his only known sons being Conla, husband of Marian Molloy (daughter of Art M’Cahir Molloy, of Ralehyn), and Anthony, Bishop of Meath. If this were the case, that would make him a common ancestor of many [[Geoghegan]]s and [[Gahagan]]s.

He died in 1644.

===''The Annals of Clonmacnoise''===
The ''[[Annals of Clonmacnoise]]'' is also known as "Mageoghagan’s Book" in honor of MacGeoghegan's contributions to its translation.

Mag Eochagáin dedicated this translation to his brother-in-law, Toirdhealbhach Mac Cochláin (Terrence Coughlin), whose family was among the last to uphold and practice native [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Irish customs.

The translation was completed on April 20, 1627 in the Castle of Lemanaghan in County Offaly. The original manuscript of MacGeoghegan's translation is lost, but there are several copies of it in both the [[Trinity College Library, Dublin|Library of Trinity College]] and in the [[British Museum]].

The original work was in [[Irish Gaelic]]. Mag Eochagáin more than once refers "to the ould Irish book out of which he wrote, to the old Irish book which he translates, out of which many leaves were lost or stolen.." MacGeoghegan seems to have preserved the value of the original Gaelic phraseology and rendered it every justice as far as we can determine in the absence of the original manuscript.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4404">{{History of the Basque people}}
The '''County of Vasconia Citerior''' (literally, the "nearer Basque country") was a medieval domain attested as of 824. It may have comprised the lands between the western Pyrenees and the river [[Adour]].

After [[Pepin the Short]]'s war on Aquitaine, Charlemagne started Frankish penetration into the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] (778) by taking the Church on his side and appointing Frankish and Burgundian counts loyal to him, even creating new counties on Vasconia’s lands ([[Fezensac]]), or expanding existing ones (Toulouse), so fragmenting the previous autochthonous territorial and political unity. The territory farther away from the Garonne was made into a county.

The Basque count (also cited as duke) [[Aznar Sanchez]] led the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824)|Carolingian expedition against Pamplona in 824]], and was captured, but he was released years later for his kinship with the captors. The region to the north of the Pyrenees remained in a state of rebellion, and Aznar Sanchez, count of ''Hither Vasconia'',  makes a comeback opposing Pepin I, but he was killed in 836 in confusing circumstances ("''died a horrible death''").{{sfnp|Collins|1990|p=129}}

His brother [[Sancho II Sanchez of Gascony|Sancho II Sanchez]] (Sans Sancion) succeeded him. He opposed both Seguin's family based in the region of Bordeaux and central Frankish authority, both Pepin I and Louis the Pious, who were reluctant to acknowledge him Duke of Vasconia. Sancho supported [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]] until Sancho took over most of present-day Gascony, and eventually [[Charles the Bald]] confirmed him as duke of Vasconia (851). The county seems to have been re-incorporated to [[Gascony]] (Vasconia) with Sancho II Sanchez, but his lineage was broken soon after, and a new dynasty of Gascon Basque dukes seem to have taken over.

While records on the region of the Adour are scanty thereafter for the next 150 years, in 886 [[Garcia II Sanchez of Gascony|Garcia II Sanchez]] is cited with the title ''comes et marchio in limitibus oceani'' ("count and margrave to the limits of the ocean"). [[Vikings]] are attested during this period as raiding upstream the banks of the Adour, destroying also monasteries not heard of thereafter. The Norsemen stationed themselves at the mouth of the Adour in or next to Bayonne, and in other coastal areas, until they were definitely defeated by [[William II Sanchez of Gascony]] (982). In 1020, the County of [[Labourd]] and [[Bayonne]] emerged for the first time in the same area as a result of a treaty between [[Kingdom of Navarre|Pamplona]] and Gascony.

'''Dimitris Psathas''' ({{lang-el|Δημήτρης Ψαθάς}}; 1907-13 November 1979) was a famous modern [[Greece|Greek]] [[satirist]] and playwright. He was born in Trabzon of Pontos in 1907 and died in [[Athens]] in 1979.

He went to Athens in 1923 and finished his studies whereby he devoted himself to both [[journalism]] and the theatre. In 1937, he published his first book ''Justice is in a good mood'' and the next year his next book ''Justice is in a bad mood''. However, he became widely known with his book ''Madam Sousou''. He wrote many theatrical plays with great success. He also wrote a 500-page historical chronicle about the resistance of his compatriots entitled ''Land of Pontos'' in 1996.

The '''Dixie Professorship of Ecclesiastical History''' is one of the senior [[List of Professorships at the University of Cambridge|professorships]] in [[history]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].

[[Lord Mayor of London]] in the 16th century, Sir [[Wolstan Dixie]], left funds to found both scholarships and fellowships at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]]. In 1878 the fellowships were abolished and replaced by the professorship that still bears his name.

Nietzsche's body of work touched a wide range of topics, including art, [[philology]], history, religion, [[tragedy]], culture and science. His early inspiration was drawn from figures such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; [[Richard Wagner]]&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; His writing spans philosophical [[polemic]]s, poetry, [[cultural critic]]ism and fiction while displaying a fondness for [[aphorism]] and [[irony]].&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, A.

Nietzsche's thought enjoyed renewed popularity in the 1960s and his ideas have since had a profound impact on 20th and early-21st century thinkers across philosophy—especially in schools of [[continental philosophy]] such as [[existentialism]], [[postmodernism]] and [[post-structuralism]]—as well as art, literature, [[psychology]], politics and popular culture.&lt;ref name="Raymond A.

==Life==
===Youth (1844–1868)===
{{anchor|youth}}
Born on 15 October 1844, Nietzsche grew up in the small town of [[Röcken]], near [[Leipzig]], in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Saxony]]. He was named after King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia]], who turned 49 on the day of Nietzsche's birth (Nietzsche later dropped his middle name Wilhelm).{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=22}} Nietzsche's parents, Carl Ludwig Nietzsche (1813–1849), a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor and former teacher; and {{ill|Franziska Nietzsche|de|Franziska Oehler}} (1826–1897), married in 1843, the year before their son's birth. They had two other children: a daughter, [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]], born in 1846; and a second son, Ludwig Joseph, born in 1848. Nietzsche's father died from a brain ailment in 1849; Ludwig Joseph died six months later at age two.&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/nietzsche/ |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |last=Wicks |first=Robert |date=1 January 2014 |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Winter 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family then moved to [[Naumburg]], where they lived with Nietzsche's maternal grandmother and his father's two unmarried sisters. After the death of Nietzsche's grandmother in 1856, the family moved into their own house, now [[Nietzsche-Haus, Naumburg|Nietzsche-Haus]], a museum and Nietzsche study centre.

[[File:Nietzsche1861.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nietzsche, 1861]]
Nietzsche attended a boys' school and then a private school, where he became friends with Gustav Krug, [[Rudolf Wagner]] and Wilhelm Pinder, all of whom came from highly respected families.

In 1854, he began to attend Domgymnasium in [[Naumburg]]. Because his father had worked for the state (as a pastor) the now-fatherless Nietzsche was offered a scholarship to study at the internationally recognized [[Pforta|Schulpforta]] (the claim that Nietzsche was admitted on the strength of his academic competence has been debunked: his grades were nowhere near the top of the class).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brobjer|first1=Thomas H.|title=Why Did Nietzsche Receive a Scholarship to Study at Schulpforta?|journal=Nietzsche-Studien|volume=30|pages=322–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred and studied there from 1858 to 1864, becoming friends with [[Paul Deussen]] and Carl von Gersdorff. He also found time to work on poems and musical compositions. Nietzsche led "Germania", a music and literature club, during his summers in Naumburg.&lt;ref name="Wicks"/&gt; At [[Schulpforta]], Nietzsche received an important grounding in languages—Greek, Latin, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and French—so as to be able to read important [[primary source]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Krell, David Farrell, and Donald L. Bates. ''The Good European: Nietzsche's work sites in word and image''. University of Chicago Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; he also experienced for the first time being away from his family life in a small-town conservative environment. His end-of-semester exams in March 1864 showed a 1 in Religion and German; a 2a in Greek and Latin; a 2b in French, History, and Physics; and a "lackluster" 3 in Hebrew and Mathematics.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=37}}

While at [[Pforta]], Nietzsche had a penchant for pursuing subjects that were considered unbecoming. He became acquainted with the work of the then almost-unknown poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], calling him "my favorite poet" and composing an essay in which he said that the mad poet raised consciousness to "the most sublime ideality."&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, Ronald. ''Nietzsche: A Critical Life'', p. 42. Oxford University Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher who corrected the essay gave it a good mark but commented that Nietzsche should concern himself in the future with healthier, more lucid, and more "German" writers. Additionally, he became acquainted with [[Ernst Ortlepp]], an eccentric, blasphemous, and often drunken poet who was found dead in a ditch weeks after meeting the young Nietzsche but who may have introduced Nietzsche to the music and writing of [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, Joachim. ''Nietzsche &amp; Wagner: A Lesson in Subjugation'', p. 17. Yale University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps under Ortlepp's influence, he and a student named Richter returned to school drunk and encountered a teacher, resulting in Nietzsche's demotion from first in his class and the end of his status as a [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]].{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=21}}

After graduation in September 1864,&lt;ref&gt;His "valedictorian paper" (''Valediktionsarbeit'', graduation thesis for Pforta students) was titled "On [[Theognis of Megara]]" ("''De Theognide Megarensi''"); see Anthony K. Jensen, Helmut Heit (eds.), ''Nietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity'', A&amp;C Black, 2014, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche commenced studies in theology and classical philology at the [[University of Bonn]] with hope of becoming a minister. For a short time he and Deussen became members of the [[Burschenschaft]] ''[[Franconia|Frankonia]]''. After one semester (and to the anger of his mother), he stopped his theological studies and lost his faith.&lt;ref name=Schaberg&gt;{{Citation |last=Schaberg |first=William |title=The Nietzsche Canon |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1996 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as his 1862 essay "Fate and History", Nietzsche had argued that historical research had discredited the central teachings of Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Jörg |last=Salaquarda |contribution=Nietzsche and the Judaeo-Christian tradition |title=The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche |place=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1996 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[David Strauss]]'s ''[[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|Life of Jesus]]'' also seems to have had a profound effect on the young man.&lt;ref name=Schaberg/&gt; In addition, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' influenced young Nietzsche with its argument that people created God, and not the other way around.&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;{{Citation |last=Higgins |first=Kathleen |title=What Nietzsche Really Said|publisher=Random House, NY |year=2000|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1865, at the age of 20, Nietzsche wrote to his sister Elisabeth, who was deeply religious, a letter regarding his loss of faith. This letter contains the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hence the ways of men part: if you wish to strive for peace of soul and pleasure, then believe; if you wish to be a devotee of truth, then inquire...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://babbledom.com/2011/02/17/intermission/ |title=Nietzsche, Letter to His Sister (1865) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124011911/http://babbledom.com/2011/02/17/intermission/ |archivedate=24 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Portraits-Arthur Schopenhauer-1845.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] strongly influenced Nietzsche's earliest philosophical thought]]
Nietzsche subsequently concentrated on studying philology under Professor [[Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl]], whom he followed to the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1865.{{sfn|Magnus|1999}} There, he became close friends with his fellow student [[Erwin Rohde]]. Nietzsche's first philological publications appeared soon after.

In 1865, Nietzsche thoroughly studied the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. He owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading Schopenhauer's ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' and later admitted that Schopenhauer was one of the few thinkers whom he respected, dedicating the essay "[[s:Schopenhauer as Educator|Schopenhauer as Educator]]" in the ''[[Untimely Meditations]]'' to him.

In 1866, he read [[Friedrich Albert Lange]]'s ''[[History of Materialism and Critique of its Present Importance|History of Materialism]]''. Lange's descriptions of [[Kant]]'s anti-materialistic philosophy, the rise of European [[Materialism]], Europe's increased concern with science, [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], and the general rebellion against tradition and authority intrigued Nietzsche greatly. Nietzsche would ultimately argue the impossibility of an evolutionary explanation of the human aesthetic sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pence |first=Charles H. |title=Nietzsche's aesthetic critique of Darwin |journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=165–90 |year=2011 |pmid=22288334 |url=https://www.academia.edu/759427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, Nietzsche signed up for one year of voluntary service with the Prussian artillery division in Naumburg. He was regarded as one of the finest riders among his fellow recruits, and his officers predicted that he would soon reach the rank of captain. However, in March 1868, while jumping into the saddle of his horse, Nietzsche struck his chest against the [[Saddle|pommel]] and tore two muscles in his left side, leaving him exhausted and unable to walk for months.&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, Ronald. ''Nietzsche: A Critical Life'', p. 93. Oxford University Press (New York), 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff – June, 1868|Letter to Karl Von Gersdorff]], June 1868.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Nietzsche turned his attention to his studies again, completing them in 1868 and meeting with [[Richard Wagner]] for the first time later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Selected_Letters_of_Friedrich_Nietzsche#To_Rohde_-_October.2C_1868 |title=Letter to Rohde |date=November 1868 |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professor at Basel (1869–1878)===
{{anchor|Professor at Basel|Basel}}
[[File:Rohde Gersdorff Nietzsche.JPG|thumb|upright|From left to right: [[Erwin Rohde]], Karl von Gersdorff and Nietzsche, October 1871]]
In part because of Ritschl's support, Nietzsche received a remarkable offer in 1869 to become professor of [[classical philology]] at the [[University of Basel]] in Switzerland. He was only 24 years old and had neither completed his doctorate nor received a teaching certificate ("[[habilitation]]"). He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[Leipzig University|University of Leipzig]], again with Ritschl's support.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony K. Jensen, Helmut Heit (eds.), ''Nietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity'', A&amp;C Black, 2014, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that the offer came at a time when he was considering giving up philology for science, he accepted.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=25}} To this day, Nietzsche is still among the youngest of the tenured Classics professors on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Paul |last=Bishop |title=Nietzsche and Antiquity |year=2004 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche's 1870 projected [[doctoral thesis]], ''Contribution toward the Study and the Critique of the Sources of Diogenes Laertius'' (''Beiträge zur Quellenkunde und Kritik des Laertius Diogenes''), examined the origins of the ideas of [[Diogenes Laërtius]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony K. Jensen, Helmut Heit (eds.), ''Nietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity'', A&amp;C Black, 2014, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Though never submitted, it was later published as a ''Gratulationsschrift'' (congratulatory publication) at [[Basel]].&lt;ref&gt;George E. McCarthy, [http://personal.kenyon.edu/mccarthy/Book1.htm ''Dialectics and Decadence'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Between 1868 and 1870, he published two other studies on Diogenes Laertius: ''De Fontibus Diogenis Laertii'' ("On the Sources of Diogenes Laertius"; Part I: 1868, Part II: 1869) and ''Analecta Laertiana'' (1870); see Jensen and Heit (eds.), 2014, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before moving to Basel, Nietzsche renounced his Prussian citizenship: for the rest of his life he remained officially [[Stateless person|stateless]].&lt;ref&gt;Hecker, Hellmuth: "Nietzsches Staatsangehörigkeit als Rechtsfrage", ''Neue Juristische Wochenschrift'', Jg. 40, 1987, nr. 23, pp. 1388–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His, Eduard: "Friedrich Nietzsches Heimatlosigkeit", ''Basler Zeitschrift für Geschichte und Altertumskunde'', vol. 40, 1941, p. 159–86. Note that some authors (among them Deussen and [[Mazzino Montinari|Montinari]]) mistakenly claim that Nietzsche became a Swiss citizen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Nietzsche served in the Prussian forces during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–1871) as a medical [[orderly]]. In his short time in the military, he experienced much and witnessed the traumatic effects of battle. He also contracted [[diphtheria]] and [[dysentery]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] speculates that he might also have contracted [[syphilis]] at a brothel along with his other infections at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sax|first1=L.|title=What was the cause of Nietzsche's dementia?|journal=[[Journal of Medical Biography]]|volume=11|issue=1|pages=47–54|year=2003|pmid=12522502|doi=10.1177/096777200301100113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Richard |last=Schain |title=The Legend of Nietzsche's Syphilis |place=Westwood |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2001}}.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On returning to Basel in 1870, Nietzsche observed the establishment of the [[German Empire]] and [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s subsequent policies as an outsider and with a degree of skepticism regarding their genuineness. His inaugural lecture at the university was "[[s:Homer and Classical Philology|Homer and Classical Philology]]". Nietzsche also met [[Franz Overbeck]], a professor of theology who remained his friend throughout his life. [[Afrikan Spir]], a little-known Russian philosopher responsible for the 1873 ''Thought and Reality'', and Nietzsche's colleague the famed historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]], whose lectures Nietzsche frequently attended, began to exercise significant influence on him during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Green, M.S. ''Nietzsche and the Transcendental Tradition''. University of Illinois Press, 2002.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche had already met [[Richard Wagner]] in Leipzig in 1868 and later Wagner's wife, [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]]. Nietzsche admired both greatly and during his time at Basel frequently visited Wagner's house in [[Tribschen]] in [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]]. The Wagners brought Nietzsche into their most intimate circle—including [[Franz Liszt]], of whom Nietzsche colloquially described: "Liszt or the art of running after women!".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rupert Hughes]], [http://www.bookrags.com/ebooks/11419/1.html#gsc.tab=0 ''The Love Affairs of Great Musicians, Volume 2''].&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche enjoyed the attention he gave to the beginning of the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth Festival]]. In 1870, he gave Cosima Wagner the manuscript of "The Genesis of the Tragic Idea" as a birthday gift. In 1872, Nietzsche published his first book, ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''. However, his colleagues within his field, including Ritschl, expressed little enthusiasm for the work in which Nietzsche eschewed the classical philologic method in favor of a more speculative approach. In his [[polemic]] ''Philology of the Future'', [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] dampened the book's reception and increased its notoriety. In response, Rohde (then a professor in [[Kiel]]) and Wagner came to Nietzsche's defense. Nietzsche remarked freely about the isolation he felt within the philological community and attempted unsuccessfully to transfer to a position in philosophy at Basel instead.

[[File:Friedrich Nietzsche-1872.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nietzsche, c. 1872]]
In 1873, Nietzsche began to accumulate notes that would be posthumously published as ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]''. Between 1873 and 1876, he published four separate long essays: "[[David Strauss]]: the Confessor and the Writer", "On the Use and Abuse of History for Life", "Schopenhauer as Educator" and "Richard Wagner in Bayreuth". These four later appeared in a collected edition under the title ''[[Untimely Meditations]]''. The essays shared the orientation of a cultural critique, challenging the developing German culture along lines suggested by Schopenhauer and Wagner. During this time in the circle of the Wagners, he met [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] and [[Hans von Bülow]]. He also began a friendship with [[Paul Rée]], who in 1876 influenced him into dismissing the pessimism in his early writings. However, he was deeply disappointed by the [[Bayreuth Festival]] of 1876, where the banality of the shows and baseness of the public repelled him. He was also alienated by Wagner's championing of "German culture", which Nietzsche felt a contradiction in terms as well as by Wagner's celebration of his fame among the German public. All this contributed to his subsequent decision to distance himself from Wagner.

With the publication in 1878 of ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' (a book of [[aphorism]]s ranging from metaphysics to morality to religion to gender studies), a new style of Nietzsche's work became clear, highly influenced by [[Afrikan Spir]]'s ''Thought and Reality''&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, Rüdiger (trans. Shelley Frisch). ''Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography'', p. 161. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2003. "This work had long been consigned to oblivion, but it had a lasting impact on Nietzsche. Section 18 of ''Human, All Too Human'' cited Spir, not by name, but by presenting a 'proposition by an outstanding logician' (2,38; HH I §18)."&lt;/ref&gt; and reacting against the pessimistic philosophy of Wagner and Schopenhauer. Nietzsche's friendship with Deussen and Rohde cooled as well. In 1879, after a significant decline in health, Nietzsche had to resign his position at Basel. Since his childhood, various disruptive illnesses had plagued him, including moments of shortsightedness that left him nearly blind, [[migraine]] headaches, and violent indigestion. The 1868 riding accident and diseases in 1870 may have aggravated these persistent conditions, which continued to affect him through his years at Basel, forcing him to take longer and longer holidays until regular work became impractical.

===Independent philosopher (1879–1888)===

Living off his pension from Basel and aid from friends, Nietzsche travelled frequently to find climates more conducive to his health and lived until 1889 as an independent author in different cities. He spent many summers in [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils Maria]] near [[St. Moritz]] in Switzerland. He spent his winters in the Italian cities of [[Genoa]], [[Rapallo]], and [[Turin]] and the French city of [[Nice]]. In 1881, when [[French conquest of Tunisia|France occupied Tunisia]], he planned to travel to [[Tunis]] to view Europe from the outside but later abandoned that idea, probably for health reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Stephan |last=Güntzel |url=http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 |title=Nietzsche's Geophilosophy |page=85 |journal=Journal of Nietzsche Studies |volume=25 |place=University Park (Penn State) |date=15 October 2003 |language=English, German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184745/http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}; republished on HyperNietzsche.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche occasionally returned to Naumburg to visit his family, and, especially during this time, he and [[Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche|his sister]] had repeated periods of conflict and reconciliation.

While in [[Genoa]], Nietzsche's failing eyesight prompted him to explore the use of [[typewriter]]s as a means of continuing to write. He is known to have tried using the [[Hansen Writing Ball#Sale and popular use|Hansen Writing Ball]], a contemporary typewriter device. In the end, a past student of his, [[Heinrich Köselitz]] or [[Heinrich Köselitz|Peter Gast]], became a sort of private secretary to Nietzsche. In 1876, Gast transcribed the crabbed, nearly illegible handwriting of Nietzsche for the first time with Richard Wagner in Bayreuth.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=221}} He subsequently transcribed and proofread the galleys for almost all of Nietzsche's work from then on. On at least one occasion on 23 February 1880, the usually poor Gast received 200 marks from their mutual friend, Paul Rée.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=297}} Gast was one of the very few friends Nietzsche allowed to criticize him. In responding most enthusiastically to ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Gast did feel it necessary to point out that what were described as "superfluous" people were in fact quite necessary. He went on to list the number of people [[Epicurus]], for example, had to rely on even to supply his simple diet of goat cheese.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=415}}

To the end of his life, Gast and Overbeck remained consistently faithful friends. [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] remained like a motherly patron even outside the Wagner circle. Soon Nietzsche made contact with the music-critic [[Carl Fuchs]]. Nietzsche stood at the beginning of his most productive period. Beginning with ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' in 1878, Nietzsche published one book or major section of a book each year until 1888, his last year of writing; that year, he completed five.

In 1882, Nietzsche published the first part of ''[[The Gay Science]]''. That year he also met [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.f-nietzsche.de/lou_e.htm |contribution=Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salomé |title=F Nietzsche |place=DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Malwida von Meysenbug and [[Paul Rée]].

Salomé's mother took her to Rome when Salomé was 21. At a literary salon in the city, Salomé became acquainted with [[Paul Rée]]. Rée proposed marriage to her, but she instead proposed that they should live and study together as 'brother and sister', along with another man for company, where they would establish an academic commune.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} Rée accepted the idea, and suggested that they be joined by his friend Nietzsche. The two met Nietzsche in Rome in April 1882, and Nietzsche is believed to have instantly fallen in love with Salome, as Rée had done.  Nietzsche asked Rée to propose marriage to Salome, which she rejected. She had been interested in Nietzsche as a friend, but not as a husband.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} Nietzsche nonetheless was content to join together with Rée and Salome touring through Switzerland and Italy together, planning their commune.  The three traveled with Salomé's mother through Italy and considered where they would set up their "Winterplan" commune.   This commune was intended to be set up in an abandoned monastery, but no suitable location was found.  On 13 May, in Lucerne, when Nietzsche was alone with Salome, he earnestly proposed marriage to her again, which she rejected. He nonetheless was happy to continue with the plans for an academic commune.
.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} After discovering the situation, Nietzsche's sister Elizabeth became determined to get Nietzsche away from the "immoral woman".{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=151}} 
Nietzsche and Salomé spent the summer together in [[Tautenburg]] in Thuringia, often with Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth as a chaperone. Salomé reports that he asked her to marry him on three separate occasions and that she refused, though the reliability of her reports of events has come into question.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=49}} Arriving in [[Leipzig]], (Germany) in October, Salomé and Rée separated from Nietzsche after a falling-out between Nietzsche and Salomé, in which Salomé believed that Nietzsche was desperately in love with her.

While the three spent a number of weeks together in Leipzig in October 1882, the following month Rée and Salome ditched Nietzsche, leaving for Stibbe without any plans to meet again. Nietzsche soon fell into a period of mental anguish, although he continued to write to Rée, stating "We shall see one another from time to time, won't we?"{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=152}} In later recriminations, Nietzsche would blame on separate occasions the failure in his attempts to woo Salome both on Salome, Rée, and on the intrigues of his sister (who had written letters to the family of Salome and Rée to disrupt the plans for the commune). Nietzsche wrote of the affair in 1883, that he now felt "genuine hatred for my sister."{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=152}}

Amidst renewed bouts of illness, living in near-isolation after a falling out with his mother and sister regarding Salomé, Nietzsche fled to Rapallo, where he wrote the first part of ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' in only ten days.

[[File:Nietzsche1882.jpg|thumb|Photo of Nietzsche by {{ill|Gustav Adolf Schultze|de}}, 1882]]
By 1882, Nietzsche was taking huge doses of [[opium]], but he was still having trouble sleeping.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=389}} In 1883, while staying in Nice, he was writing out his own prescriptions for the sedative [[chloral hydrate]], signing them "Dr. Nietzsche".{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=453}}

After severing his philosophical ties with [[Schopenhauer]] (who was long dead and never met Nietzsche) and his social ties with Wagner, Nietzsche had few remaining friends. Now, with the new style of ''Zarathustra'', his work became even more alienating, and the market received it only to the degree required by politeness. Nietzsche recognized this and maintained his solitude, though he often complained about it. His books remained largely unsold. In 1885, he printed only 40 copies of the fourth part of ''Zarathustra'' and distributed only a fraction of these among close friends, including [[Helene von Druskowitz]].

In 1883, he tried and failed to obtain a lecturing post at the [[University of Leipzig]]. It was made clear to him that, in view of his attitude towards Christianity and his concept of God, he had become effectively unemployable by any German university. The subsequent "feelings of revenge and resentment" embittered him: "And hence my rage since I have grasped in the broadest possible sense what wretched means (the depreciation of my good name, my character, and my aims) ''suffice'' to take from me the trust of, and therewith the possibility of obtaining, pupils."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast – August 1883 2|Letter to Peter Gast]]. August 1883.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Nietzsche broke with his publisher Ernst Schmeitzner, disgusted by his antisemitic opinions. Nietzsche saw his own writings as "completely buried and unexhumeable in this anti-Semitic dump" of Schmeitzner—associating the publisher with a movement that should be "utterly rejected with cold contempt by every sensible mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/corresp.htm#schmei |title=Correspondences |publisher=Thenietzschechannel.com |date=1 February 2000 |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then printed ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' at his own expense. He also acquired the publication rights for his earlier works and over the next year issued second editions of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'', and ''[[The Gay Science]]'' with new prefaces placing the body of his work in a more coherent perspective. Thereafter, he saw his work as completed for a time and hoped that soon a readership would develop. In fact, interest in Nietzsche's thought did increase at this time, if rather slowly and hardly perceptibly to him. During these years Nietzsche met [[Meta von Salis]], [[Carl Spitteler]], and [[Gottfried Keller]].

In 1886, his sister Elisabeth married the [[Antisemitism|antisemite]] [[Bernhard Förster]] and travelled to Paraguay to found [[Nueva Germania]], a "Germanic" colony—a plan Nietzsche responded to with mocking laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title= |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=online |contribution=Förster-Nietzsche, Elisabeth |url=http://www.search.eb.com.librarypx.lclark.edu/eb/article-9034925 |date=10 October 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2015}} Through correspondence, Nietzsche's relationship with Elisabeth continued through cycles of conflict and reconciliation, but they met again only after his collapse. He continued to have frequent and painful attacks of illness, which made prolonged work impossible.

In 1887, Nietzsche wrote the polemic ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''. During the same year, he encountered the work of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], to whom he felt an immediate kinship.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast – March, 1887|Letter to Peter Gast]]. March 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; He also exchanged letters with [[Hippolyte Taine]] and [[Georg Brandes]]. Brandes, who had started to teach the philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in the 1870s, wrote to Nietzsche asking him to [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Relation to Søren Kierkegaard|read Kierkegaard]], to which Nietzsche replied that he would come to [[Copenhagen]] and read Kierkegaard with him. However, before fulfilling this promise, he slipped too far into illness. In the beginning of 1888, Brandes delivered in Copenhagen one of the first lectures on Nietzsche's philosophy.

Although Nietzsche had previously announced at the end of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' a new work with the title ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]: Attempt at a [[transvaluation of values|Revaluation of All Values]]'', he eventually seems to have abandoned this idea and instead used some of the draft passages to compose ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'' in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Mazzino |last=Montinari |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |year=1974}} translated as {{Citation |language=German |year=1991 |title=Friedrich Nietzsche. Eine Einführung |place=Berlin-New York |publisher=De Gruyter}}; and {{Citation |language=French |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |publisher=[[PUF]] |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His health seemed to improve and he spent the summer in high spirits. In the fall of 1888, his writings and letters began to reveal a higher estimation of his own status and "fate". He overestimated the increasing response to his writings, however, especially to the recent polemic, ''[[The Case of Wagner]]''. On his 44th birthday, after completing ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', he decided to write the autobiography ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]''. In its preface—which suggests Nietzsche was well aware of the interpretive difficulties his work would generate—he declares, "Hear me! For I am such and such a person. Above all, do not mistake me for someone else."{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=Preface, section 1}} In December, Nietzsche began a correspondence with [[August Strindberg]] and thought that, short of an international breakthrough, he would attempt to buy back his older writings from the publisher and have them translated into other European languages. Moreover, he planned the publication of the compilation ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'' and of the poems that made up his collection ''[[Dionysian-Dithyrambs]]''.

===Psychological illness and death (1889–1900)===

[[File:NietzscheHouseTurin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turin]] house where Nietzsche stayed (background) seen from Piazza Carlo Alberto, where he is said to have had his breakdown (at left: rear façade of [[Palazzo Carignano]])]]
On 3 January 1889, Nietzsche suffered a [[mental breakdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Magnus|editor1-first=Bernd|editor2-last=Higgins|editor2-first=Kathleen Marie|title=The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521367677|pages=79–81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Xeb80itrlRIC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two policemen approached him after he caused a public disturbance in the streets of [[Turin]]. What happened remains unknown, but an often-repeated tale from shortly after his death states that Nietzsche witnessed the flogging of a horse at the other end of the Piazza Carlo Alberto, ran to the horse, threw his arms up around its neck to protect it, and then collapsed to the ground.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=67}}&lt;ref&gt;Anacleto Verrecchia, "Nietzsche's Breakdown in Turin," in ''Nietzsche in Italy'', ed. Thomas Harrison (Stanford University: ANMA Libri, 1988) 105–12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following few days, Nietzsche sent short writings—known as the ''Wahnzettel'' ("Madness Letters")—to a number of friends including [[Cosima Wagner]] and [[Jacob Burckhardt]]. Most of them were signed "[[Dionysos]]", though some were also signed "der Gekreuzigte" meaning "the crucified one". To his former colleague Burckhardt, Nietzsche wrote: "I have had [[Caiaphas]] put in [[fetters]]. Also, last year I was crucified by the German doctors in a very drawn-out manner. Wilhelm, [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], and all anti-Semites abolished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Gerald |url=http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/ger/nilettersg.htm |publisher=The Nietzsche Channel |title=Nietzsches Briefe.

Wilhelm, Bismarck und alle Antisemiten abgeschafft."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he commanded the German emperor to go to Rome to be shot and summoned the European powers to take military action against Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[[Stefan Zweig|Zweig, Stefan]] (1939), ''Master Builders [trilogy], The Struggle with the Daimon'', Viking Press, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; that the pope should be put in jail and that he, Nietzsche, created the world and was in the process of having all anti-Semites shot dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/ger/nlett1889g.htm Nietzsches Briefe, Ausgewählte Korrespondenz, Wahnzettel 1889].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 1889, Burckhardt showed the letter he had received from Nietzsche to Overbeck. The following day, Overbeck received a similar letter and decided that Nietzsche's friends had to bring him back to Basel. Overbeck travelled to Turin and brought Nietzsche to a psychiatric clinic in Basel. By that time Nietzsche appeared fully in the grip of a serious mental illness, and his mother Franziska decided to transfer him to a clinic in [[Jena]] under the direction of [[Otto Binswanger]]. In January 1889, they proceeded with the planned release of ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', by that time already printed and bound. From November 1889 to February 1890, the art historian [[Julius Langbehn]] attempted to cure Nietzsche, claiming that the methods of the medical doctors were ineffective in treating Nietzsche's condition. Langbehn assumed progressively greater control of Nietzsche until his secretiveness discredited him. In March 1890, Franziska removed Nietzsche from the clinic and, in May 1890, brought him to her home in Naumburg. During this process Overbeck and Gast contemplated what to do with Nietzsche's unpublished works. In February, they ordered a fifty-copy private edition of ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'', but the publisher [[C. G. Naumann]] secretly printed one hundred. Overbeck and Gast decided to withhold publishing ''The Antichrist'' and ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' because of their more radical content. Nietzsche's reception and recognition enjoyed their first surge.{{Chronology citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 1893, Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth returned from [[Nueva Germania]] in Paraguay following the suicide of her husband. She read and studied Nietzsche's works and, piece by piece, took control of them and their publication. Overbeck eventually suffered dismissal and Gast finally co-operated. After the death of Franziska in 1897, Nietzsche lived in [[Weimar]], where Elisabeth cared for him and allowed visitors, including [[Rudolf Steiner]] (who in 1895 had written one of the first books praising Nietzsche),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Rudolf |last=Steiner |title=Friedrich Nietzsche, ein Kämpfer gegen seine Zeit |place=Weimar |year=1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp |needed=yes|date=April 2012}} to meet her uncommunicative brother. Elisabeth at one point went so far as to employ Steiner as a tutor to help her to understand her brother's philosophy. Steiner abandoned the attempt after only a few months, declaring that it was impossible to teach her anything about philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Andrew |last=Bailey |title=First Philosophy: Fundamental Problems and Readings in Philosophy |publisher=Broadview Press |year=2002 |page=704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eh-dm-27.JPG|thumb|[[Heinrich Köselitz|Peter Gast]] "corrected" Nietzsche's writings after the breakdown without his approval]]
Nietzsche's mental illness was originally diagnosed as [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary syphilis]], in accordance with a prevailing medical paradigm of the time. Although most commentators regard his breakdown as unrelated to his philosophy, [[Georges Bataille]] dropped dark hints ("'Man incarnate' must also go mad")&lt;ref&gt;Bataille, Georges (translated by Annette Michelson), "Writings on Laughter, Sacrifice, Nietzsche, Un-Knowing,"  Special issue, ''[[October (journal)|October]]'' no. 36, Spring 1986, pp. 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[René Girard]]'s postmortem psychoanalysis posits a worshipful rivalry with [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;René Girard, "Superman in the Underground: Strategies of Madness—Nietzsche, Wagner, and Dostoevsky", ''MLN'', Vol. 91, No. 6, ''Comparative Literature''.

(Daybreak, 14) The diagnosis of syphilis has since been challenged and a diagnosis of "[[bipolar disorder|manic-depressive illness]] with periodic [[psychosis]] followed by [[vascular dementia]]" was put forward by Cybulska prior to Schain's study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cybulska |first=EM |title=The madness of Nietzsche: a misdiagnosis of the millennium? |journal=Hospital Medicine |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=571–75 |date=August 2000 |pmid=11045229 |doi=10.12968/hosp.2000.61.8.1403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schain |first=Richard |title=The Legend of Nietzsche's Syphilis |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-313-31940-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Sax]] suggested the slow growth of a right-sided retro-orbital [[meningioma]] as an explanation of Nietzsche's dementia;&lt;ref name=matthews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Sax, "What was the cause of Nietzsche's dementia?"

In 1898 and 1899, Nietzsche suffered at least two strokes. This partially paralyzed him, leaving him unable to speak or walk. He likely suffered from clinical [[hemiparesis]]/hemiplegia on the left side of his body by 1899. After contracting [[pneumonia]] in mid-August 1900, he had another stroke during the night of 24–25 August and died at about noon on 25 August.&lt;ref&gt;Concurring reports in Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche's biography (1904) and a letter by Mathilde Schenk-Nietzsche to [[Meta von Salis]], 30 August 1900, quoted in Janz (1981) p. 221.

[[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] compiled ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' from Nietzsche's unpublished notebooks and published it posthumously. Because his sister arranged the book based on her own conflation of several of Nietzsche's early outlines and took great liberties with the material, the scholarly consensus has been that it does not reflect Nietzsche's intent. (For example, Elisabeth removed aphorism 35 of ''The Antichrist'', where Nietzsche rewrote a passage of the Bible.)

In Herbarz Polski, a genealogy of Polish nobility, he had come across a note about a family named 'Nicki', who could be traced back to Radwan. A member of this family named Gotard Nietzsche had left Poland for Prussia, and his descendants had eventually settled in Saxony around the year 1700.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche wrote in 1888, "My ancestors were Polish noblemen (Nietzky); the type seems to have been well preserved despite three generations of German mothers."{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=6}} At one point, Nietzsche becomes even more adamant about his Polish identity. "I am a pure-blooded Polish nobleman, without a single drop of bad blood, certainly not German blood."&lt;ref&gt;Fredrick Appel Cornell, ''Nietzsche Contra Democracy''. University Press (1998), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; On yet another occasion, Nietzsche stated, "Germany is a great nation only because its people have so much Polish blood in their veins ... I am proud of my Polish descent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Henry Louis |last=Mencken |title=The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche |origyear=1908 |publisher=University of Michigan |year=2006 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nnEOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Nietzsche+Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche believed his name might have been [[Germanized]], in one letter claiming, "I was taught to ascribe the origin of my blood and name to Polish noblemen who were called Niëtzky and left their home and nobleness about a hundred years ago, finally yielding to unbearable suppression: they were [[Protestants]]."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Heinrich von Stein, December 1882, ''KGB'' III 1, Nr. 342, p. 287; ''KGW'' V 2, p. 579; ''KSA'' 9 p. 681&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars dispute Nietzsche's account of his family's origins. Hans von Müller debunked the genealogy put forward by Nietzsche's sister in favor of a Polish noble heritage.&lt;ref&gt;von Müller, "Nietzsches Vorfahren", reprinted ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 31 (2002): 253–75.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Oehler]], the curator of the [[Nietzsche Archive]] at [[Weimar]], argued that all of Nietzsche's ancestors bore German names, including the wives' families.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=6}} Oehler claims that Nietzsche came from a long line of German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] clergymen on both sides of his family, and modern scholars regard the claim of Nietzsche's Polish ancestry as a "pure invention".&lt;ref name=mencken&gt;{{Citation |first=Henry Louis |last=Mencken |title=The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzche |others=introd. &amp; comm.

The name derives from the forename ''Nikolaus'', abbreviated to ''Nick''; assimilated with the Slavic ''Nitz'', it first became ''Nitsche'' and then ''Nietzsche''.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=6}}

It is not known why Nietzsche wanted to be thought of as Polish nobility. According to biographer [[R. J. Hollingdale]], Nietzsche's propagation of the Polish ancestry myth may have been part of his "campaign against Germany".{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=6}}

===Relationships and sexuality===
Nietzsche never married. He proposed to [[Lou Andreas-Salomé|Lou Salomé]] three times, but his proposal was rejected each time.&lt;ref&gt;
"Nietzsche's and Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salomé." Nietzsche's and Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salomé.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=June 2017}} There is a theory that blamed Salomé's view on sexuality as one of the reasons for her alienation from Nietzsche. As articulated in the 1898 [[novella]] ''Fenitschka'', she viewed the idea of sexual intercourse as prohibitive and marriage as a violation, with some suggesting that they indicated [[sexual repression]] and [[neurosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche's Women: Beyond the Whip|last=Diethe|first=Carol|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1996|isbn=978-3110148190|location=Berlin|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche scholar {{ill|Joachim Köhler|de|Joachim Köhler (Philosoph)}} has attempted to explain Nietzsche's life history and philosophy by claiming that Nietzsche was homosexual. Köhler argues that Nietzsche's syphilis, which is "...usually considered to be the product of his encounter with a prostitute in a brothel in [[Cologne]] or [[Leipzig]], is equally likely, it is now held, to have been contracted in a male brothel in [[Genoa]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Köhler |first=Joachim |title=Zarathustra's secret: the interior life of Friedrich Nietzsche |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-09278-3 |page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of the infection from a homosexual brothel was confirmed by [[Sigmund Freud]], who cited Otto Binswanger as his source.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche and Jewish Culture|last=Golomb|first=Jacob|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=978-0415095129|location=London|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Köhler also suggests Nietzsche may have had a romantic relationship as well as a friendship with [[Paul Rée]].&lt;ref name="Megill" /&gt; There is the claim that Nietzsche's homosexuality is widely known in the [[Vienna Psychoanalytic Society]], with Nietzsche's friend [[Paul Deussen]] claiming that the philosopher never "touched a woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Young Nietzsche: Becoming a Genius|last=Pletsch|first=Carl|publisher=The Free Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0029250426|location=New York|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche and Rée: A Star Friendship|last=Small|first=Robin|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=2007|isbn=9780199278077|location=Oxford|pages=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Köhler's views have not found wide acceptance among Nietzsche scholars and commentators. Allan Megill argues that, while Köhler's claim that Nietzsche was in a confrontation with his homosexual desire cannot simply be dismissed, "the evidence is very weak," and Köhler may be projecting twentieth-century understandings of sexuality on nineteenth-century notions of friendship.&lt;ref name="Megill"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Allan Megill | year = 1996 | title = Historicizing Nietzsche?

Because of Nietzsche's [[evocative]] style and provocative ideas, his philosophy generates passionate reactions. His works remain controversial, due to their varying interpretations and misinterpretations. In the Western philosophy tradition, Nietzsche's writings have been described as the unique case of free revolutionary thought, that is, revolutionary in its structure and problems, although not tied to any revolutionary project.&lt;ref name="Bennett2001"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Benjamin Bennett |title=Goethe As Woman: The Undoing of Literature |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AVYbszVKUO4C&amp;pg=PA184 |accessdate=3 January 2013 |year=2001 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=978-0-8143-2948-1 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings have also been described as a revolutionary project in which his philosophy serves as the foundation of a European cultural rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography|last=Young|first=Julian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: Herald of a New Era|last=Bowman|first=William|publisher=Hazar Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0997570304|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apollonian and Dionysian===
{{Main|Apollonian and Dionysian}}
The ''Apollonian and Dionysian'' is a two-fold philosophical concept, based on certain features of ancient Greek mythology: [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]]. Even though the concept is famously related to ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', the poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] had already spoken of it, and [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] had talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. One year before the publication of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled "On Music and Words".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://nietzsche.holtof.com/Nietzsche_various/on_music_and_words_and_rhetoric.htm |title=On Music and words}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he asserted the [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauerian]] judgment that music is a primary expression of the essence of everything. Secondarily derivative are [[Lyric poetry|lyrical poetry]] and drama, which represent mere [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] appearances of objects. In this way, [[tragedy]] is born from music.

Nietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcended]] the pessimism found in the so-called [[Silenus#The wisdom of Silenus|wisdom of Silenus]]. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. A main theme in ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian ''Kunsttrieben'' ("artistic impulses") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek [[tragedians]]. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other formed principles that were fundamental to the [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.historyguide.org/europe/dio_apollo.html |title=Nietzsche, Dionysus and Apollo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=Jim+Morrison+Apollonian+and+Dionysian |title=Ideas About Art|isbn=9781444396003|author1=Desmond|first1=Kathleen K|date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mold, man appears as the [[satyr]]. He is the horror of the annihilation of the principle of [[individuation|individuality]] and at the same time someone who delights in its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.bachelorandmaster.com/creationofknowledge/apollonianism-dyonysianisism.html |title=The Apollonianism and Dionysiansism by Friedrich Nietzsche}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these principles are meant to represent [[Cognition|cognitive]] states that appear through art as the power of nature in man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.primordialtraditions.net/prime/Library/DionysusinNietzscheandGreekMyth.aspx |title=Dionysus in Nietzsche and Greek Myth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814164705/http://www.primordialtraditions.net/prime/Library/DionysusinNietzscheandGreekMyth.aspx |archive-date=14 August 2012 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the Apollonian and Dionysian juxtapositions is apparent, in the interplay of tragedy: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make order (in the Apollonian sense) of his unjust and chaotic (Dionysian) fate, though he dies unfulfilled in the end. Elaborating on the conception of [[Hamlet]] as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and therefore is a living [[antithesis]] to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses knowledge to realize that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts him enough not to be able to make any act at all. Hamlet falls under this category—he has glimpsed the supernatural reality through the Ghost, he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his has the power to change this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://issuu.com/mcc1289/docs/hamlet-and-nietzsche |title=Procrastination in Shakespeare's Hamlet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://geoffklock.blogspot.com/2006/11/nietzsche-on-hamlet-commonplace-book.html |title=Nietzsche on Hamlet (Commonplace Book)|date=2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the audience of such drama, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what Nietzsche called the ''Primordial Unity'', which revives Dionysian nature. He describes this primordial unity as the increase of strength, experience of fullness and plenitude bestowed by [[wikt:frenzy#Noun|frenzy]]. Frenzy acts as an intoxication, and is crucial for the [[Physiology|physiological]] condition that enables making of any art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://jorbon.tripod.com/niet01.html |title=The role of art in Nietzsche's philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stimulated by this state, a person's artistic will is enhanced:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this state one enriches everything out of one's own fullness: whatever one sees, whatever wills is seen swelled, taut, strong, overloaded with strength. A man in this state transforms things until they mirror his power—until they are reflections of his perfection. This having to transform into perfection is—art.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]], he states, that tragedy begins its ''Untergang'' (literally "going under" or "downward-way," meaning decline, deterioration, downfall, death, etc.). Nietzsche objects to Euripides' use of [[Socratic method|Socratic rationalism]] and [[morality]] in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian. [[Socrates]] emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of [[myth]] and suffering to human knowledge. [[Plato]] continued with this path in his dialogues, and the modern world eventually inherited reason at the expense of artistic impulses that could be found only in the Apollonian and Dionysus dichotomy. This leads to his conclusion that European culture from the time of Socrates had always been only Apollonian and thus [[decadence|decadent]] and unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.carnaval.com/prophecy/ |title=Dionysus versus Apollo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that whenever Apollonian culture dominates, the Dionysian lacks the structure to make a coherent art, and when Dionysian dominates, the Apollonian lacks the necessary passion. Only the beautiful middle, the interplay of these two forces, brought together as an art, represented real Greek tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/nietzsche/section1.html |title=The Birth of Tragedy Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the impact of this idea can be seen in the book ''Patterns of Culture'', where [[anthropologist]] [[Ruth Benedict]] uses Nietzschean opposites of "Apollonian" and "Dionysian" as the stimulus for her thoughts about [[Native American culture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://classes.yale.edu/03-04/anth500b/projects/project_sites/02_alexy/ruthpatterns.html |first=Ruth |last=Benedict |title=Patterns of Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Jung]] has written extensively on the dichotomy in ''[[Psychological Types]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://pkdreligion.blogspot.com/2011/11/influence-of-cg-jung-on-pkd-by-frank.html |title=Influence of C.G. Jung on PKD – notes by Frank Bertrand, excerpt Umland|date=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]] has commented that his book ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'' should be read "under the sun of the great Nietzschean inquiry". Here Foucault references Nietzsche's description of the birth and death of tragedy and his explanation that the subsequent tragedy of the Western world was the refusal of the tragic and, with that, refusal of the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4aNoFpNfYeMC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=foucault+genealogy |title=Foucault's Nietzschean Genealogy|isbn=9780791411490|author1=Mahon|first1=Michael|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painter [[Mark Rothko]] was influenced by Nietzsche's view of tragedy, which were presented in ''The Birth of Tragedy.''

===Perspectivism===
{{Main|Perspectivism}}

Nietzsche claimed the death of God would eventually lead to the loss of any universal perspective on things, and along with it any coherent sense of [[objective truth]].{{Sfn |Lampert |1986 |pp=17–18}}{{Sfn |Heidegger}}{{Rp |needed=yes |date=March 2012}} Nietzsche himself rejected the idea of objective reality, arguing that knowledge is [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and conditional, relative to various fluid perspectives or interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TxlMccAak4wC&amp;q=Objective |title=Nietzsche: Naturalism and Interpretation |first=Cox |last=Cristoph|isbn=9780520921603 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to constant reassessment of rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) according to the circumstances of individual perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Richard, ''Nietzsche'', 1983, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has acquired the name ''[[perspectivism]]''.

In ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Nietzsche proclaims that a table of values hangs above every great person. He points out that what is common among different peoples is the act of esteeming, of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to see those values come to pass. The willing is more essential than the intrinsic worth of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche. "A thousand goals have there been so far," says Zarathustra, "for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal." Hence, the title of the aphorism, "On The Thousand And One Goals". The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. [[Max Weber]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical and cultural endeavor, as well as their political understanding. Weber, for example, relies on Nietzsche's perspectivism by maintaining that objectivity is still possible—but only after a particular perspective, value, or end has been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.criticism.com/md/weber1.html |title=Max Weber's View of Objectivity in Social Science |first=Hoenisch |last=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S1518-44712006000200006&amp;script=sci_arttext |title=Culture and perspectivism in Nietzsche's and Weber's view|journal=Teoria &amp; Sociedade|volume=2|issue=SE|pages=0|date=00/2006|last1=Nobre|first1=Renarde Freire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his critique of traditional philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Plato]] in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', Nietzsche attacked ''[[thing in itself]]'' and ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' ("I think, therefore I am") as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] beliefs based on naive acceptance of previous notions and [[fallacy|fallacies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.monomorphic.org/wordpress/objective-and-subjective-reality-perspectivism/ |title=Objective and subjective reality; perspectivism|date=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] puts Nietzsche in a high place in the history of philosophy. While criticizing nihilism and Nietzsche together as a sign of general decay,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3JA3vyj4slsC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Alasdair+MacIntyre+Nietzsche+Kant |title=From Hegel to Existentialism|isbn=9780195061826|author1=Solomon|first1=Robert C|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; he still commends him for recognizing psychological motives behind Kant and [[David Hume|Hume]]'s moral philosophy:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TN7sop-yILMC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=Alasdair+MacIntyre+Nietzsche+Kant |title=Alasdair MacIntyre|isbn=9780521793810|author1=Murphy|first1=Mark C|date=23 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "slave revolt" in morals===
{{Main|Master–slave morality}}
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--4 paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
In ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'', Nietzsche's [[Genealogy (philosophy)|genealogical]] account of the development of modern moral systems occupies a central place. For Nietzsche, a fundamental shift took place during human history from thinking in terms of ''good and bad'' toward ''good and evil''.

The initial form of morality was set by a warrior [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and other ruling castes of ancient civilizations. Aristocratic values of good and bad coincided with and reflected their relationship to lower [[caste]]s such as slaves. Nietzsche presents this "master morality" as the original system of morality—perhaps best associated with [[Homer]]ic Greece. To be "good" was to be happy and to have the things related to happiness: wealth, strength, health, power, etc. To be "bad" was to be like the slaves the aristocracy ruled over: poor, weak, sick, pathetic—an object of pity or disgust rather than hatred.

"Slave morality" comes about as a reaction to master-morality. Here, value emerges from the contrast between good and evil: good being associated with other-worldliness, charity, piety, restraint, meekness, and submission; and evil seen as worldly, cruel, selfish, wealthy, and aggressive. Nietzsche sees slave morality as pessimistic and fearful, values for them serving only to ease the existence for those who suffer from the very same thing. He associates slave-morality with the Jewish and Christian traditions, in a way that slave-morality is born out of the [[ressentiment]] of slaves. Nietzsche argued that the idea of equality allowed slaves to overcome their own condition without hating themselves. And by denying the inherent inequality of people (such as success, strength, beauty or intelligence), slaves acquired a method of escape, namely by generating new values on the basis of rejecting something that was seen as a perceived source of frustration. It was used to overcome the slave's own sense of inferiority before the (better-off) masters. It does so by making out slave weakness to be a matter of choice, by, e.g., relabeling it as "meekness". The "good man" of master morality is precisely the "evil man" of slave morality, while the "bad man" is recast as the "good man".

Nietzsche sees the slave-morality as a source of the nihilism that has overtaken Europe. Modern Europe and Christianity exist in a hypocritical state due to a tension between master and slave morality, both values contradictorily determining, to varying degrees, the values of most Europeans (who are "[[motley]]"). Nietzsche calls for exceptional people to no longer be ashamed of their uniqueness in the face of a supposed morality-for-all, which he deems to be harmful to the flourishing of exceptional people. He cautions, however, that morality, per se, is not bad; it is good for the masses, and should be left to them. Exceptional people, on the other hand, should follow their own "inner law". A favorite motto of Nietzsche, taken from [[Pindar]], reads: "Become what you are."

A long standing assumption about Nietzsche is that he preferred master over slave morality. However, the Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] rejected this interpretation, writing that Nietzsche's analyses of these two types of morality were only used in a [[descriptive ethics|descriptive]] and historic sense, they were not meant for any kind of acceptance or glorifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wvKRUSdUsnkC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=Master+slave+morality |title=From Shakespeare to existentialism|isbn=978-0691013671|author1=Kaufmann|first1=Walter Arnold|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is clear from his own writings that Nietzsche wanted the victory of master morality. He linked the "salvation and future of the human race with the unconditional dominance"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Genealogy of Morals|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=1887|isbn=|location=|pages=First essay, section 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; of master morality and called master morality "a higher order of values, the noble ones, those that say Yes to life, those that guarantee the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecce Homo|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=1908|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter on The Case of Wagner, section 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as "there is an order of rank between man and man," there is also an order of rank "between morality and morality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Good and Evil|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=1886|isbn=|location=|pages=Section 228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Nietzsche waged a philosophic war against the slave morality of Christianity in his "revaluation of all values" in order to bring about the victory of a new master morality that he called the "philosophy of the future" (''Beyond Good and Evil'' is subtitled ''Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: Herald of a New Era|last=Bowman|first=William|publisher=Hazar Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0997570304|location=|pages=31–38, 60–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'', Nietzsche begins his "Campaign against Morality".{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=187}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=M I}} He calls himself an "immoralist" and harshly criticizes the prominent moral philosophies of his day: Christianity, [[Kantianism]], and [[utilitarianism]]. Nietzsche's concept "[[God is dead]]" applies to the doctrines of Christendom, though not to all other faiths: he claimed that [[Buddhism]] is a successful religion that he compliments for fostering critical thought.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=26}} Still, Nietzsche saw his philosophy as a counter-movement to nihilism through appreciation of art:

{{quote|text=Art as the single superior counterforce against all will to negation of life, art as the anti-Christian, anti-Buddhist, anti-Nihilist par excellence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://jorbon.tripod.com/niet01.html |title=Art in Nietzsche's philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nietzsche claimed that the Christian faith as practised was not a proper representation of Jesus' teachings, as it forced people merely to believe in the way of Jesus but not to act as Jesus did, in particular his example of refusing to judge people, something that Christians had constantly done the opposite of.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=26}} He condemned institutionalized Christianity for emphasizing a morality of [[pity]] (''Mitleid''), which assumes an inherent illness in society:{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=27}}
{{quote|text=Christianity is called the religion of ''pity''. Pity stands opposed to the tonic emotions which heighten our vitality: it has a depressing effect. We are deprived of strength when we feel pity. That loss of strength which suffering as such inflicts on life is still further increased and multiplied by pity. Pity makes suffering contagious.&lt;ref&gt;''The Antichrist'', section 7. transl. Walter Kaufmann, in ''The Portable Nietzsche'', 1977, pp. 572–73.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' Nietzsche called the establishment of moral systems based on a dichotomy of [[good and evil]] a "calamitous error",{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=Why I Am a Destiny, §3}} and wished to initiate a [[transvaluation of values|re-evaluation]] of the [[Value (ethics)|values]] of the Judeo-Christian world.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888c |pp=4, 8, 18, 29, 37, 40, 51, 57, 59}} He indicates his desire to bring about a new, more naturalistic source of value in the vital impulses of life itself.

While Nietzsche attacked the principles of [[Judaism]], he was not [[antisemitic]]: in his work ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'', he explicitly condemns antisemitism, and points out that his attack on Judaism was not an attack on contemporary Jewish people but specifically an attack upon the ancient Jewish priesthood whom he claims [[antisemitic Christians]] paradoxically based their views upon.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=69}} An Israeli historian who performed a statistical analysis of everything Nietzsche wrote about Jews claims that cross references and context make clear that almost all (85%) negative comments are actually attacks on Christian doctrine or, sarcastically, on Richard Wagner.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, "Nietzsche: Anti- or Philo-Semite? An Examination of His Books," in ''God, Man and Nietzsche'', iUniverse, 2008 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche felt that modern antisemitism was "despicable" and against European ideals.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=68}} Its cause, in his opinion, was the growth in European nationalism and the endemic "jealousy and hatred" of Jewish success.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=68}} He wrote that Jews should be thanked for helping uphold a respect for the philosophies of ancient Greece,{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=68}} and for giving rise to "the noblest human being (Christ), the purest philosopher ([[Baruch Spinoza]]), the mightiest book, and the most effective moral code in the world."&lt;ref name=nebraska&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm. ''Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits'', Univ. of Nebraska Press (1986) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of God and nihilism===
{{Main|God is dead|Nihilism}}
The statement "[[God is dead]]", occurring in several of Nietzsche's works (notably in ''[[The Gay Science]]''), has become one of his best-known remarks. On the basis of it, most commentators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Morgan |first=George Allen |title=What Nietzsche Means |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1941 |page=36 |isbn=978-0-8371-7404-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; regard Nietzsche as an [[atheism|atheist]]; others (such as Kaufmann) suggest that this statement reflects a more subtle understanding of divinity. Recent developments in modern science and the increasing [[secularization]] of European society had effectively 'killed' the [[Abrahamic]] God, who had served as the basis for meaning and value in the West for more than a thousand years. The death of God may lead beyond bare perspectivism to outright [[nihilism]], the belief that nothing has any inherent importance and that life lacks purpose. Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]], belief in God (which [[Theodicy|justifies]] the evil in the world) and a basis for [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective knowledge]]. In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote to a primal form of nihilism—the despair of meaninglessness. As [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] put the problem, "If God as the suprasensory ground and goal of all reality is dead, if the suprasensory world of the ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory and above it its vitalizing and upbuilding power, then nothing more remains to which man can cling and by which he can orient himself."{{Sfn |Heidegger |p=61}}

One such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche calls ''passive nihilism'', which he recognises in the [[pessimism|pessimistic]] philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. Schopenhauer's doctrine—which Nietzsche also refers to as [[Buddhism in the West#Philosophical interest|Western Buddhism]]—advocates separating oneself from will and desires in order to reduce suffering. Nietzsche characterises this [[Asceticism|ascetic]] attitude as a "will to nothingness", whereby life turns away from itself, as there is nothing of value to be found in the world. This moving away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although in this, the nihilist appears to be inconsistent:&lt;ref&gt;This "will to nothingness" is still a willing of some sort, because it is exactly ''as'' a pessimist that Schopenhauer clings to life. See F. Nietzsche, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', III:7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A nihilist is a man who judges that the real world ought ''not'' to be, and that the world as it ought to be does not exist. According to this view, our existence (action, [[suffering]], willing, feeling) has no meaning: this 'in vain' is the nihilists' pathos—an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists.|Friedrich Nietzsche, KSA 12:9 [60]|taken from ''The Will to Power'', section 585, translated by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]}}

Nietzsche approaches the problem of nihilism as a deeply personal one, stating that this problem of the modern world is a problem that has "become conscious" in him.&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:7 [8]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he emphasizes both the danger of nihilism and the possibilities it offers, as seen in his statement that "I praise, I do not reproach, [nihilism's] arrival. I believe it is one of the greatest crises, a moment of the deepest self-reflection of humanity. Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes master of this crisis, is a question of his strength!"&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, Complete Works Vol. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is ''overcome'' that a culture can have a true foundation on which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure. Heidegger interprets the death of God with what he explains as the death of [[metaphysics]]. He concludes that metaphysics has reached its potential and that the ultimate fate and downfall of metaphysics was proclaimed with the statement "God is dead".

===Will to power===
{{Main|Will to power}}
A basic element in Nietzsche's philosophical outlook is the "[[will to power]]" (''der Wille zur Macht''), which he maintained provides a basis for understanding human behavior—more so than competing explanations, such as the ones based on pressure for adaptation or survival.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |p=13}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1882 |p=349}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1887 |p=II:12}} As such, according to Nietzsche, the drive for conservation appears as the major motivator of human or animal behavior only in exceptions, as the general condition of life is not one of emergency, of 'struggle for existence'.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888b |loc=Skirmishes of an untimely man, §14}} More often than not, self-conservation is but a consequence of a creature's will to exert its strength on the outside world.

In presenting his theory of human behavior, Nietzsche also addressed, and attacked, concepts from philosophies popularly embraced in his days, such as Schopenhauer's notion of an aimless will or that of [[utilitarianism]]. Utilitarians claim that what moves people is mainly the desire to be happy, to accumulate pleasure in their lives. But such a conception of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society,&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]], ''Routledge guide to Nietzsche on morality'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim ''per se''—it is instead a consequence of a successful pursuit of one's aims, of the overcoming of hurdles to one's actions—in other words, of the fulfillment of the will.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888c |loc=§2}}

Related to his theory of the will to power is his speculation, which he did not deem final,{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, §36}} regarding the reality of the physical world, including inorganic matter—that, like man's affections and impulses, the material world is also set by the dynamics of a form of the will to power. At the core of his theory is a rejection of [[atomism]]—the idea that matter is composed of stable, indivisible units (atoms). Instead, he seems to have accepted the conclusions of [[Ruđer Bošković]], who explained the qualities of matter as a result of an interplay of forces.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche comments in many notes about matter being a hypothesis drawn from the metaphysics of substance: G. Whitlock, "Roger Boscovich, Benedict de Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche: The Untold Story", ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 25, 1996, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, §12}} One study of Nietzsche defines his fully developed concept of the will to power as "the element from which derive both the quantitative difference of related forces and the quality that devolves into each force in this relation" revealing the will to power as "the principle of the synthesis of forces."{{Sfn |Deleuze |2006 |p=46}} Of such forces Nietzsche said they could perhaps be viewed as a primitive form of the will. Likewise he rejected as a mere interpretation the view that the movement of bodies is ruled by inexorable laws of nature, positing instead that movement was governed by the power relations between bodies and forces.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, §22}} Other scholars disagree that Nietzsche considered the material world to be a form of the will to power: Nietzsche thoroughly criticized metaphysics, and by including the will to power in the material world, he would simply be setting up a new metaphysics. Other than aphorism 36 in ''Beyond Good and Evil'', where he raised a question regarding will to power as being in the material world, it was only in his notes (unpublished by himself), where he wrote about a metaphysical will to power. Nietzsche directed his landlord to burn those notes in 1888 when he left Sils Maria for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nie/summary/v031/31.1leddy.html |title=Project MUSE – Nietzsche's Mirror: The World as Will to Power (review) |journal=The Journal of Nietzsche Studies |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=66–68 |doi=10.1353/nie.2006.0006 |accessdate=22 August 2014|date=2006-06-14 |last1=Leddy |first1=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eternal return===
{{Main|Eternal return}}

"Eternal return" (also known as "eternal recurrence") is a hypothetical concept that posits that the universe has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form for an infinite number of times across infinite time or space. It is a purely [[physics|physical]] concept, involving no supernatural [[reincarnation]], but the return of beings in the same bodies. Nietzsche first invokes the idea of eternal return in a parable in Section 341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'', and also in the chapter "Of the Vision and the Riddle" in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', among other places.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1961 |pp=176–80}} Nietzsche contemplates the idea as potentially "horrifying and paralyzing," and says that its burden is the "heaviest weight" imaginable ("''das schwerste Gewicht''").&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kundera |first=Milan |title=The Unbearable Lightness of Being |year=1999 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life, a reaction to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s praise of denying the will‐to‐live. To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires ''[[amor fati]]'', "love of fate".&lt;ref name=dudl&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dudley |first=Will |title=Hegel, Nietzsche, and Philosophy: Thinking Freedom |year=2002 |page=201 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4dLeWFK6qp0C&amp;pg=PA201|isbn=9780521812504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Heidegger]] points out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence presents this concept as a [[Thought experiment|hypothetical ''question'']] rather than postulating it as a fact.  According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the ''question'' of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a thing could possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: "The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.'"&lt;ref&gt;See Heidegger, ''Nietzsche. Volume II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' trans. [[David Farrell Krell]]. New York: Harper and Row, 1984. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does Nietzsche posit that the universe is recurring over infinite time and space, but that the different versions of events that have occurred in the past may at one point or another take place again, hence "all configurations that have previously existed on this earth must yet meet..."&lt;ref name="Vintage Books"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kaufmann |first=Friedrich Nietzsche. Transl., with comm., by Walter |title=The Gay Science with a Prelude in Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs |date=1974 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0394719856 |page=16 |edition=[1st ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; And with each version of events is hoping that some knowledge or awareness is gained to better the individual, hence "And thus it will happen one day that a man will be born again, just like me and a woman will be born, just like Mary—only that it is hoped to be that the head of this man may contain a little less foolishness..."&lt;ref name="Vintage Books"/&gt;

[[Alexander Nehamas]] writes in ''Nietzsche: Life as Literature'' of three ways of seeing the eternal recurrence: "(A) My life will recur in exactly identical fashion." This expresses a totally fatalistic approach to the idea. "(B) My life may recur in exactly identical fashion." This second view conditionally asserts [[cosmology]], but fails to capture what Nietzsche refers to in ''The Gay Science'', 341. Finally, "(C) If my life were to recur, then it could recur only in identical fashion." Nehamas shows that this interpretation exists totally independently of physics and does not presuppose the truth of cosmology. Nehamas draws the conclusion that if individuals constitute themselves through their actions, then they can only maintain themselves in their current state by living in a recurrence of past actions (Nehamas 153). Nietzsche's thought is the negation of the idea of a history of salvation.&lt;ref name="Tongeren2000"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Paul Van Tongeren |title=Reinterpreting Modern Culture: An Introduction to Friedrich Nietzsche's Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TqxrlA9Qxg0C&amp;pg=PA295 |accessdate=18 April 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=Purdue University Press |isbn=978-1-55753-157-5 |page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Übermensch===
{{Main|Übermensch}}

Another concept important to an understanding of Nietzsche's thought is the ''Übermensch''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |title=The Portable Nietzsche |others=trans. Walter Kaufmann |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |others=ed.

Zarathustra's gift of the overman is given to a mankind not aware of the problem to which the overman is the solution."{{Sfn |Lampert |1986 |p=18}} Zarathustra presents the overman as the creator of new values, and he appears as a solution to the problem of the death of God and nihilism. The overman does not follow morality of common people since that favors mediocrity but instead rises above the notion of [[good and evil]] and above the "[[Herd behavior|herd]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-nietzsche.html |title=Philosophy 302: Ethics Nietzsche, "Slave and Master Morality"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Zarathustra proclaims his ultimate goal as the journey towards the state of overman. He wants a kind of spiritual evolution of self-awareness and overcoming of traditional views on morality and justice that stem from the [[superstition]] beliefs still deeply rooted or related to the notion of God and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.gradesaver.com/thus-spoke-zarathustra/study-guide/major-themes/ |title=Thus Spoke Zarathustra themes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2018}}

While interpretations of Nietzsche's overman vary wildly, here is one of his quotations from ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' (Prologue, §§3–4):

{{quote|text=I teach you the overman. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?... All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood, and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is ape to man? A laughing stock or painful embarrassment. And man shall be that to overman: a laughing stock or painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape... The overman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth... Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman—a rope over an abyss ... what is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.}}

Zarathustra contrasts the overman with the [[last man]] of egalitarian modernity (most obvious example being democracy), an alternative goal humanity might set for itself. The last man is possible only by mankind's having bred an [[Apathy|apathetic]] creature who has no great passion or commitment, who is unable to dream, who merely earns his living and keeps warm. This concept appears only in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', and is presented as a condition that would render the creation of the overman impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html |title=Nietzsche and Heidegger |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607060856/http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that the notion of eternal return is related to the overman, since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or [[asceticism]]. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the overman will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.

The Nazis tried to incorporate the concept into their ideology. After his death, [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] became the curator and editor of her brother's manuscripts. She reworked Nietzsche's unpublished writings to fit her own [[German nationalism#1871 to World War I, 1914–1918|German nationalist]] ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating Nietzsche's stated opinions, which were explicitly [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche's criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism|opposed to antisemitism and nationalism]]. Through her published editions, Nietzsche's work became associated with [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]];&lt;ref name="Golomb 2002"/&gt; 20th century scholars contested this interpretation of his work and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available.

Although Nietzsche has famously been misrepresented as a predecessor to Nazism, he criticized anti-Semitism, [[pan-Germanism]] and, to a lesser extent, [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Keith Ansell-Pearson, ''An Introduction to Nietzsche as Political Thinker: The Perfect Nihilist,'' Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he broke with his editor in 1886 because of his opposition to his editor's anti-Semitic stances, and his rupture with [[Richard Wagner]], expressed in ''[[The Case of Wagner]]'' and ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]],'' both of which he wrote in 1888, had much to do with Wagner's endorsement of pan-Germanism and anti-Semitism — and also of his rallying to Christianity. In a March 29, 1887 letter to [[Theodor Fritsch]], Nietzsche mocked anti-Semites, Fritsch, [[Eugen Dühring]], Wagner, Ebrard&lt;!-- is it [[Johannes Heinrich August Ebrard]] ? --&gt;, [[Adolf Wahrmund|Wahrmund]], and the leading advocate of pan-Germanism, [[Paul de Lagarde]], who would become, along with Wagner and [[Houston Chamberlain]], the main official influences of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name=Bataille/&gt; This 1887 letter to Fritsch ended by: "And finally, how do you think I feel when the name Zarathustra is mouthed by anti-Semites?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20150815060910/http://www.geocities.com/thenietzschechannel/nlett1887.htm March 29, 1887 letter] to [[Theodor Fritsch]] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of mass culture===
Friedrich Nietzsche held a pessimistic view on modern society and culture. His views stand against the concept of popular culture. He believed the press and mass culture led to conformity and brought about mediocrity. Nietzsche saw a lack of intellectual progress, leading to the decline of the human species. According to Nietzsche, individuals needed to overcome this form of mass culture. He believed some people were able to become superior individuals through the use of will power. By rising above mass culture, society would produce higher, brighter and healthier human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kellner |first=Douglas |title=Nietzsche's Critique of Mass Culture |journal=International Studies in Philosophy |year=1999 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=77–89 |doi=10.5840/intstudphil199931353 |url=http://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=intstudphil&amp;id=intstudphil_1999_0031_0003_0077_0089&amp;onlyautologin=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading and influence==
[[File:Nietzsche Archives in Weimar.jpg|thumb|The residence of Nietzsche's last three years along with archive in [[Weimar]], Germany, which holds many of Nietzsche's papers]]
{{Main|Library of Friedrich Nietzsche}}
A trained philologist, Nietzsche had a thorough knowledge of [[Greek philosophy]]. He read [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Plato]], [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Afrikan Spir|Spir]],&lt;ref&gt;Brobjer, Thomas. "Nietzsche's Reading and Private Library, 1885–1889." Published in ''Journal of History of Ideas.''&lt;/ref&gt; who became his main opponents in his philosophy, and later [[Baruch Spinoza]], whom he saw as his "precursor" in many respects&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Franz Overbeck, 30 July 1881&lt;/ref&gt; but as a personification of the "ascetic ideal" in others. However, Nietzsche referred to Kant as a "moral fanatic", Plato as "boring", Mill as a "blockhead", and of Spinoza he said: "How much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray?"{{Sfn|Russell|2004|pp=693–97}} He likewise expressed contempt for British author [[George Eliot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas J. |last=Joudrey |title=The Defects of Perfectionism: Nietzsche, Eliot, and the Irrevocability of Wrong |journal=[[Philological Quarterly]] |number=96.1 |year=2017 |pages=77–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche's philosophy, while innovative and revolutionary, was indebted to many predecessors. While at Basel, Nietzsche offered lecture courses on pre-Platonic philosophers for several years, and the text of this lecture series has been characterized as a "lost link" in the development of his thought. "In it concepts such as the will to power, the eternal return of the same, the overman, gay science, self-overcoming and so on receive rough, unnamed formulations and are linked to specific pre-Platonics, especially Heraclitus, who emerges as a pre-Platonic Nietzsche."{{Sfn|Nietzsche|2001|p=xxxvii}} The [[pre-Socratic]] thinker [[Heraclitus]] was known for the rejection of the concept of [[being]] as a constant and eternal principle of universe, and his embrace of "flux" and incessant change. His symbolism of the world as "child play" marked by amoral spontaneity and lack of definite rules was appreciated by Nietzsche.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|pp=37–39}} From his Heraclitean sympathy, Nietzsche was also a vociferous detractor of [[Parmenides]], who opposed Heraclitus and believed all world is a single Being with no change at all.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|p=48}}

In his ''Egotism in German Philosophy'', [[George Santayana|Santayana]] claimed that Nietzsche's whole philosophy was a reaction to Schopenhauer. Santayana wrote that Nietzsche's work was "an emendation of that of Schopenhauer. The will to live would become the will to dominate; pessimism founded on reflection would become optimism founded on courage; the suspense of the will in contemplation would yield to a more biological account of intelligence and taste; finally in the place of pity and asceticism (Schopenhauer's two principles of morals) Nietzsche would set up the duty of asserting the will at all costs and being cruelly but beautifully strong. These points of difference from Schopenhauer cover the whole philosophy of Nietzsche."{{Sfn|Santayana|1916|p=114}}

Nietzsche expressed admiration for 17th-century French moralists such as [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], [[Jean de La Bruyère|La Bruyère]] and [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues|Vauvenargues]],&lt;ref&gt;Brendan Donnellan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/404869 "Nietzsche and La Rochefoucauld"] in ''[[The German Quarterly]]'', Vol. 52, No. 3 (May 1979), pp. 303–18&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for [[Stendhal]].{{Sfn|Nietzsche|1888d|loc="Why I am So Clever", §3}} The [[organicism]] of [[Paul Bourget]] influenced Nietzsche,&lt;ref&gt;Johan Grzelczyk, [http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=jgrzelczyk-4 "Féré et Nietzsche: au sujet de la décadence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116213847/http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=jgrzelczyk-4 |date=16 November 2006 }}, ''HyperNietzsche'', 1 November 2005 {{fr icon}}.

Nietzsche's works did not reach a wide readership during his active writing career. However, in 1888 the influential Danish critic [[Georg Brandes]] aroused considerable excitement about Nietzsche through a series of lectures he gave at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In the years after Nietzsche's death in 1900, his works became better known, and readers have responded to them in complex and sometimes controversial ways.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri19chisrich#page/672/mode/1up 1910 article from the Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Germans eventually discovered his appeals for greater [[individualism]] and personality development in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', but responded to them divergently. He had some following among left-wing Germans in the 1890s; in 1894–1895 German conservatives wanted to ban his work as [[subversive]]. During the late 19th century [[Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's ideas were commonly associated with anarchist movements]] and appear to have had influence within them, particularly in France and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;O.

Writer on music [[Donald Mitchell (writer)|Donald Mitchell]] notes that [[Gustav Mahler]] was "attracted to the poetic fire of Zarathustra, but repelled by the intellectual core of its writings." He also quotes Mahler himself, and adds that he was influenced by Nietzsche's conception and affirmative approach to nature, which Mahler presented in his [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]] using [[Zarathustra's roundelay]]. [[Frederick Delius]] produced a piece of choral music, ''[[A Mass of Life]]'', based on a text of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', while [[Richard Strauss]] (who also based his [[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|''Also sprach Zarathustra'']] on the same book), was only interested in finishing "another chapter of symphonic autobiography".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yKCq909vSpwC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=Mahler+Nietzsche+influence |title=Gustav Mahler: The Early Years |first=Mitchell |last=Donald|isbn=9780520041417 |year=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous writers and poets influenced by Nietzsche include [[André Gide]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Robinson Jeffers]], [[Pío Baroja]], [[D.

Nietzsche's growing prominence suffered a severe setback when his works became closely associated with [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. Many political leaders of the twentieth century were at least superficially familiar with Nietzsche's ideas, although it is not always possible to determine whether they actually read his work. It is debated among scholars whether Hitler read Nietzsche, although if he did his reading of him may not have been extensive.&lt;ref&gt;"We know, from his [Hitler's] secretary, that he could quote Schopenhauer by the page, and the other German philosopher of willpower, Nietzsche, whose works he afterwards presented to [[Mussolini]], was often on his lips." [[Hugh Trevor-Roper|Trevor Roper, H.]] ''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'', p. xxxvii. Introductory essay for ''Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944 Secret Conversations''. Enigma Books (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'Landsberg,' Hitler told [[Hans Frank]], was his 'university paid for by the state.' He read, he said, everything he could get hold of: Nietzsche, [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], [[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]], [[Heinrich von Treitschke|Treitschke]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s Thoughts and Memories, and the war memoirs of German and allied generals and statesmen....But Hitler's reading and reflection were anything but academic, doubtless he did read much. However, as was noted in an earlier chapter, he made clear in [[Mein Kampf|My Struggle]] that reading for him had purely an instrumental purpose. He read not for knowledge or enlightenment, but for confirmation of his own preconceptions." Kershaw, Ian Hitler: ''Hubris 1889–1936''. WW Norton p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weaver Santaniello, ''Nietzsche, God, and the Jews'', [[SUNY Press]], 1994, p. 41: "Hitler probably never read a word of Nietzsche."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berel Lang, ''Post-Holocaust: Interpretation, Misinterpretation, and the Claims of History'', Indiana University Press, 2005, p. 162: "Arguably, Hitler himself never read a word of Nietzsche; certainly, if he did read him, it was not extensively."&lt;/ref&gt; He was a frequent visitor to the Nietzsche museum in Weimar and did use expressions of Nietzsche's, such as "lords of the earth" in ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;William L.

A decade after World War II, there was a revival of Nietzsche's philosophical writings thanks to exhaustive translations and analyses by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] and [[R. J. Hollingdale]]. Others, well known philosophers in their own right, wrote commentaries on Nietzsche's philosophy, including [[Martin Heidegger]], who produced a four-volume study, and [[Lev Shestov]], who wrote a book called ''Dostoyevski, Tolstoy and Nietzsche'' where he portrays Nietzsche and Dostoyevski as the "thinkers of tragedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Nietzsche |first=Shestov |last=Lev|isbn=978-0821400531}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Simmel]] compares Nietzsche's importance to ethics to that of [[Copernicus]] for [[cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.philosophynow.org/issues/29/Nietzsche_and_Germany |title=Nietzsche &amp; Germany |first=Sorgner |last=Stefan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] read Nietzsche avidly from his early life, and later frequently discussed many of his concepts in his own works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5290">[[File:Abbey ruins and St Edmundsbury Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1877473.jpg|thumb|200px|The ruins of [[Bury St Edmunds Abbey]] in Suffolk, where de Runcey spent much of his life.]]
'''Geoffrey de Runcey''' (1340s?–1384) was a [[English historians in the Middle Ages|14th century chronicler]] and abbey servant who wrote a valuable, although [[Lost work|now-incomplete]] journal of his travels around [[medieval]] [[East Anglia]].

Little is known about de Runcey's ancestry, but his name suggests that he originated from [[North Runcton]], now in the town of [[King's Lynn]] in [[Norfolk]], "Runcey" being an archaic spelling (see also [[Oxburgh Hall]] at [[Oxborough]]). It has been speculated that he was the son of a landowner, [[free tenant]], or even the [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] son of a priest, as despite not being [[ordain]]ed he was educated at [[Bury St. Edmunds Abbey]] and was in service with the monastery for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=society&gt;Tim Wells, [http://geoffreyderunceysociety.atspace.com/ Biography and excerpts] at the ''Geoffrey de Runcey Society'', retrieved 26 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known for his ''Chronicle'' from circa 1379. De Runcey appears to have been sent by the priory to spread the news of the death of the high [[abbot]] of Bury around the Benedictine monasteries of East Anglia, in the process coming into contact with many walks of life. The chronicle was likely to have been written as evidence that the task was accomplished. He died in 1384, although the cause of death is not recorded. He was interred at the priory of St Edmund, in [[Bury St. Edmunds]], [[Suffolk]], although his tomb was destroyed during the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]].&lt;ref&gt;"Houses of Benedictine monks: Abbey of Bury St Edmunds" in ''A History of the County of Suffolk: Volume 2'' (1975), pp. 56-72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Abbey of Bury St. Edmund's" in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Chronicle''==
[[File:Page of Geoffrey de Runcey chronicle.jpg|thumb|200px|Portion of the chronicle manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Montague Williams, ''Geoffrey de Runcey Society Newsletter'', volume 4 (Reydon, 1983), p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The ''Chronicle'' is, unusually, written in late [[Middle English]], although in a second version (B manuscript), de Runcey or another hand appears to have (poorly) [[Gloss (annotation)|translated]] sections into [[Latin language|Latin]] for the newly chosen abbot's reading.&lt;ref name=society/&gt; This version is of a more decorated nature.&lt;ref name=society/&gt; His journal has proved particularly useful for historians researching [[The Fens|Fen]] customs before [[Cornelius Vermuyden]]'s great drainage scheme of the 1630s, and is notable for its whimsical, yet unusually [[secular]] outlook and lack of [[superstition]].&lt;ref name=society/&gt; In particular his vivid account of [[stilt walker]]s has provided the foundation for many histories of the area:

''Stilltemen are yfounden inn the Fenn regionis…Althow theyye are usually triumfant, manny younge boyes are accustomed to falle manny tymes beforr theyye are trewly sucsesfull.''&lt;ref name=society/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startlearningnow.com/articles/The-Fens.htm Article about the Fens and stilt-walkers] from ''startlearningnow.com'', retrieved 22 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of his original journal has unfortunately been lost, although the remaining fragments are kept preserved at the Hillard Collection in [[Suffolk]], the [[Wisbech Museum]] and a transcription into modern English of key parts of both manuscripts is available at the [[Chatteris]] Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornucopia.org.uk/html/search/verb/ListIdentifiers/set/location/1091 Wisbech Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210551/http://www.cornucopia.org.uk/html/search/verb/ListIdentifiers/set/location/1091 |date=2015-09-23 }} at ''Cornucopia.org.uk'', Retrieved 26 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/cambscc/infocam/cid.nsf/1a07a463d0114afd80256d1a00550114/d6337714ed12c36980256ce9003df2db Chatteris Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312011457/http://www2.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/cambscc/infocam/cid.nsf/1a07a463d0114afd80256d1a00550114/d6337714ed12c36980256ce9003df2db |date=2007-03-12 }} at ''cambridgeshire.gov.uk'', retrieved 22 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giovanni Battista Gallizioli''' or '''Gallicciolli''' (17 May 1733 – 12 May 1806) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[hebraist]], [[Oriental studies|orientalist]], [[historian]], [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] and [[philologist]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.cerl.org/record/cnp00974529 Gallicciolli, Giovanni Battista]&lt;/ref&gt; [[catholic priest]] and citizen of the [[Republic of Venice]].&lt;ref name="DBI"&gt;{{Cite publication|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giambattista-gallicciolli_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=GALLICCIOLLI, Giambattista|work=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|volume=51|year=1998|author=Paolo Preto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Born in [[Venice]] in 1733 from Paolo and Adriana Grismondi, Giovanni Battista Gallizioli received a first instruction from Jacopo Scattaia, a mediocre preceptor. In 1749 he entered the [[clergy]] and began his wide studies, ranging from [[theology]] to [[philosophy]], from [[history]] to [[ancient literature]], especially to the eastern languages, especially [[Hebrew]] (his master was the rabbi [[Simchah ben Abraham Calimani]]), the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and the [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldean]]. He also gained knowledge of English and French as well as of [[mathematics]] and [[geometry]].&lt;ref name="DBI" /&gt;

For a time he was employed as a private teacher, but in December 1782 he was called to take the Greek and Hebrew chair in Venice. There is no documentary evidence that, as claimed by some biographers, Gallicciolli rejected the chair of Oriental languages at the [[University of Parma]]. Certainly he rejected the proposal of [[Andrea Querini]] who wanted him at the [[University of Padua]]. He accepted, however, to teach Greek for free to the masters of the [[Patriarchal Seminary of Venice]].&lt;ref name="DBI" /&gt;

Until the end of his existence, he was divided between his activities of scholar and [[philologist]] and priest in [[San Cassiano, Venice|San Cassiano]], his native parish.&lt;ref name="DBI" /&gt;

From the very beginning, Galliccioli distinguished himself, in Venice and outside, as a great connoisseur of Jewish language and culture. Between 1774 and 1805 he was in close contact with [[Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi]], with whom he had an epistle of philological questions. He was also a friend of [[Jacopo Nani]] and [[Andrea Memmo]], for whom he studied ancient inscriptions and codes.&lt;ref name="DBI" /&gt;

The first important publication that emphasized his relevance, especially in the patristic era, was ''S. Gregorii papae I cognomento Magni Opera omnia'', an edition of the works of [[Saint Gregory the Great]] printed between 1768 and 1776. In the introduction, the author underlined the innovations on which the work was based, focusing on the coding of the [[Biblioteca Marciana]] codes and those of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Torcello|bishop of Torcello]] [[Giovanni Nani]].&lt;ref name="DBI" /&gt;

He died in Venice in 1806.&lt;ref name="DBI" /&gt;

[[Image:Globe Galleries.JPG|thumb|upright|The pit and upper levels of the reconstruction of the Globe]]
A '''groundling''' was a person who visited the [[Globe Theatre]] in the early 17th century. They were too poor to pay to be able to sit on one of the three levels of the theatre. If they paid one penny, they could stand in "the pit", also called "the yard", just below the stage, to watch the play. Standing in the pit was uncomfortable, and  people were usually packed in tightly. The groundlings were commoners who were also referred to as ''stinkards'' or ''penny-stinkers''.  The name 'groundlings' came about after [[Hamlet (character)|Hamlet]] referenced them as such when the play was first performed around 1600.  At the time, the word had entered the English language to mean a small type of fish with a gaping mouth - from the vantage point of the actor playing Hamlet, set on a stage raised around 5 feet from the ground, the sea of upturned faces may have looked like wide-mouthed fish.&lt;ref&gt;Gurr, Andrew Playgoing in Shakespeare’s London (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005) p.21  {{ISBN|0-521-54322-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were known to misbehave and are commonly believed to have thrown food such as fruit and nuts at characters they did not like, although there is no evidence of this.{{cn|date=November 2016}}  They would watch the plays from the cramped pits with sometimes over 500 people standing there.

In 1599, [[Thomas Platter]] mentioned the cost of admission at contemporary London theatres in his diary: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are separate galleries and there one stands more comfortably and moreover can sit, but one pays more for it. Thus anyone who remains on the level standing pays only one [[Penny (English coin)|English penny]]: but if he wants to sit, he is let in at a farther door, and there he gives another penny. If he desires to sit on a cushion in the most comfortable place of all, where he not only sees everything well, but can also be seen then he gives yet another English penny at another door. And in the pauses of the comedy food and drink are carried round amongst the people and one can thus refresh himself at his own cost."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Holocene calendar''', also known as the '''Holocene Era''' or '''Human Era''' ('''HE'''), is a [[Calendar era|year numbering]] system that adds exactly 10,000 years to the currently dominant ([[Anno Domini|AD]]/[[Before Christ|BC]] or [[Common Era|CE]]/[[Before Common Era|BCE]]) numbering scheme, placing its first year near the beginning of the [[Holocene]] [[Epoch (geology)|geological epoch]] and the [[Neolithic Revolution]], when humans transitioned from a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to agriculture and fixed settlements. The year {{currentyear}} in the Holocene calendar is {{formatnum:1{{currentyear}}}} HE. The HE scheme was first proposed by [[Cesare Emiliani]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=emiliani /&gt;

==Overview==
Cesare Emiliani's proposal for a [[calendar reform]] sought to solve a number of alleged problems with the current ''Anno Domini'' era, which number the years of the commonly accepted world calendar. These issues include: 
* The ''Anno Domini'' era is based on the [[Chronology of Jesus#Year of birth estimates|erroneous estimation of the birth year]] of Jesus. The era places Jesus's birth year in [[Anno Domini|AD]] 1, but modern scholars have determined that he was likely born in or before 4 BC. Emiliani argued that replacing it with the approximate beginning of the [[Holocene]] makes more sense.
* The birth date of Jesus is a less universally relevant [[epoch (reference date)|epoch event]] than the approximate beginning of the Holocene.
* The years BC/BCE are counted down when moving from past to future, making calculation of time spans difficult.
* The ''Anno Domini'' era has no [[0 (year)|year zero]], with 1 BC followed immediately by AD 1, complicating the calculation of timespans further. This is equally true of the Common Era, its non-religious equivalent.

Instead, HE uses the "beginning of human era" as its [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]], arbitrarily defined as 10,000 BC denoted year 1 HE, so that [[AD 1]] matches 10,001 HE.&lt;ref name=emiliani&gt;{{cite journal |title=Correspondence – Calendar Reform |first=Cesare |last=Emiliani |journal=Nature |volume=366 |issue=6457 |year=1993 |page=716 |doi=10.1038/366716b0 |quote=Setting the beginning of the human era at 10,000 BC would date […] the birth of Christ at [25 December] 10,000|bibcode=1993Natur.366..716E }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a rough approximation of the start of the current [[Epoch (geology)|geologic epoch]], the [[Holocene]] (the name means ''entirely recent''). The motivation for this is that [[civilization|human civilization]] (e.g. the first [[human settlement|settlement]]s, [[agriculture]], etc.) is believed to have arisen within this time. Emiliani would later propose that the start of the Holocene be fixed at the same date as the beginning of his proposed era.&lt;ref name=emiliani94&gt;{{cite journal |title=Calendar reform for the year 2000 |first=Cesare |last=Emiliani |journal=Eos |volume=75 |issue=19 |year=1994 |page=218 |doi=10.1029/94EO00895|bibcode=1994EOSTr..75..218E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
Human Era proponents claim that it makes for easier [[geology|geological]], [[archaeology|archaeological]], [[dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] and [[history|historical]] dating, as well as that it bases its epoch on an event more universally relevant than the birth of [[Jesus]]. All key dates in human history can then be listed using a simple increasing date scale with smaller dates always occurring before larger dates. Another gain is that the Holocene Era starts before the other [[calendar era]]s. So it could be useful for the comparison and conversion of dates from different calendars.

===Accuracy===
When Emiliani discussed the calendar in 1994 he mentioned that there was no agreement on the date of the start of the Holocene epoch with contemporary estimates ranging between 12,700 and 10,970 years [[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref name=emiliani94 /&gt; Since then, scientists have improved their understanding of, and can now more accurately date the beginning of, the Holocene. A consensus viewpoint has solidified and was formally adopted by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences|IUGS]] in 2013. Current estimates place its start at 11,700 years before 2000 (9701 BC), about 300 years more recent than the epoch of the Holocene calendar.&lt;ref name="jqs"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Walker| first1 = Mike| last2 = Jonsen| first2 = Sigfus| last3 = Rasmussen| first3 = Sune Olander| last4 = Popp| first4 = Trevor| last5 = Steffensen| first5 = Jørgen-Peder| last6 = Gibbard| first6 = Phil| last7 = Hoek| first7 = Wim| last8 = Lowe| first8 = John| last9 = Andrews| first9 = John| last10 = Björck| first10 = Svante| last11 = Cwynar| first11 = Les C.| last12 = Hughen| first12 = Konrad| last13 = Kershaw| first13 = Peter| last14 = Kromer| first14 = Bernd| last15 = Litt| first15 = Thomas| last16 = Lowe| first16 = David J.| last17 = Nakagawa| first17 = Takeshi| last18 = Newnham| first18 = Rewi| last19 = Schwander| first19 = Jacob|author-link10=Svante Björck|year=2009 |title=Formal definition and dating of the GSSP (Global Stratotype Section and Point) for the base of the Holocene using the Greenland NGRIP ice core, and selected auxiliary records |url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/GSSP/Holocene.pdf |format=PDF |journal = Journal of Quaternary Science|volume=24 |issue= 1|pages=3–17 |doi=10.1002/jqs.1227 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104131948/http://www.stratigraphy.org/GSSP/Holocene.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-04| bibcode = 2009JQS....24....3W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion==
Conversion from [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] AD years to the Human Era can be achieved by adding 10,000 to the AD year. The current year of AD {{currentyear}} can be transformed into a Holocene year by adding the digit "1" before it, making it {{formatnum:1{{currentyear}}}} HE.  BC years are converted by subtracting the BC year from 10,001. A useful validity check is that the last single digits of BC and HE equivalent pairs must add up to 1 or 11.

J. van|title=Islamic Desk Reference|date=1 January 1994|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-09738-4|page=151|quote=Ibn-i Isfandiyar: Persian historian, known for his History of Tabaristan*;}}&lt;/ref&gt; historian from [[Tabaristan]], who wrote a history of his native province, the ''[[Tarikh-i Tabarestan|Tarikh-i Tabaristan]]''. What little is known of his life comes from the introduction of this work.

In his early career, Ibn Isfandiyar was a member of the court of the [[Bavandids]], a native dynasty of Tabaristan, and enjoyed the patronage of [[Ardashir I (Bavandid ruler)|Ardashir I]] (died 1206). He began compiling material for his history in 1206, which up to then mainly consisted of the "Bavand-nameh", a now-lost work presumably in Persian which our author viewed as a Bavandid romance only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward G. Browne|title=An Abridged Translation of the History of Tabaristan|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill|year=1905}} 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1209 he travelled briefly to [[Baghdad]]. On his return he stayed for two months in [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]], where he came across in Rustam b. Shahriyar's library the ''Uqidu sihr wa-qala'idu durar'' of Abu 'l-Hasan Muhammad al-Yazdadi - an Arabic history of Tabaristan subsequently lost.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, 3. Ibn Isfandiyar excoriates this book as "a work wherein the author sought rather to display his mastery over the Arabic language than to impart information to the reader". Yazdadi includes anecdota up to the time of "Qabus Shamsu'l-Ma'ali (A. D. 976—1012)": Browne p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Isfandiyar translated this work into Persian, and this, coupled with genealogical and historical information on the Bavandids, formed the core of his history. He added more material over the years, especially during his five-year stay in [[Khwarazm]]. His fate is unknown; he may have returned to his native Tabaristan and died there, or he may have perished in the [[Mongol]] sack of Khwarazm in 1220.

His history, which was not completed before 1217/17, ends with the first fall of the Bavandid dynasty in 1210. An anonymous later author continued it up to 1349, when the dynasty’s second period ended, based chiefly on [[Awliya Allah Amuli]]'s ''Tarikh-i Ruyan''. Ibn Isfandiyar's work includes much unique historical, biographical and geographical information, including verses in [[Tabari language]] and a Persian translation of the ''Letter of Tansar'', an important piece of [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] literature, sent by the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] ruler [[Ardashir III]]'s chief priest to Jusnasaf, prince of Tabaristan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7590">The '''International Medieval Combat Federation''', ('''IMCF''') is a global historical [[Contact sport#Full-contact|full contact]] sport fighting revival movement, in which combatants use historically accurate reproduction [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] armour and blunted weapons to engage in competitive fights according to authentic historical tournament rules. Founded in 2013, the organisation now attracts hundred of fighters from 26 countries at various fighting competitions around the world. Most events are open to the public and major competitions are regularly seen by tens of thousands of spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/travel/chi-medieval-combat-championships-20140506-photogallery.html|title=Medieval combat championships - Chicago Tribune|author=Chicago Tribune|date=7 May 2014|work=chicagotribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league holds dozens of smaller events throughout the year as well as a world championship competition in which national teams, selected from local or regional clubs in their respective countries, assemble at a suitably historical venue to compete. These events take the character of a [[medieval tournament]], with historical attractions and exhibits beside the competition, as well as market stalls selling historically-themed foods, goods and souvenirs. Competing teams are billeted in reproduction medieval camps and must wear authentic clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/photos/medieval-combat-championships-in-spain-1.2629829|title=Medieval combat championships in Spain|date=4 May 2014|website=Cbc.ca|accessdate=2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat unlike the medieval competition, fighting is exclusively on foot, and strict rules are enforced to ensure the safety of competitors and fairness in the competition. The fighting can be between individuals or teams of up to 16 fighters per side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/page/instantawesome-mmaknights-150504/usa-knights-clash-medieval-mma-melee|title=USA Knights clash in medieval MMA melee|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-medievalcombat-idUSKBN0NP0W720150504|title=At Polish castle, knights tool up for medieval fight|author=Reuters Editorial|date=4 May 2015|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==
The IMCF was founded in 2013 in response to a dispute between national teams and the organisers of the [[Battle of the Nations (Medieval Tournament)|Battle of the Nations]] competition, founded three years previously.&lt;ref name="BotN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://botn.info/en// |title=Battle of the Nations &amp;#124; World Championship in Historical Medieval Battle 2015 |website=Botn.info |date= |accessdate=2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://battleheritage.co.uk/about/imcf/ |title=IMCF - Battle Heritage |website=Battleheritage.co.uk |date=2015-06-13 |accessdate=2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of national teams attended the first IMCF world championship competition at the 15th century Belmonte Castle, in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holland |first=Tom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27715991 |title=Falling in love with medieval armed combat |publisher=BBC News |date=2014-06-09 |accessdate=2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/howaboutthat/10803917/In-pictures-Knights-in-shining-armour-re-enact-medieval-battles-in-Spain.html?frame=2899619 |title=In pictures: Knights in shining armour re-enact medieval battles in Spain |website=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2014-05-02 |accessdate=2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27280460|title=Modern-day knights draw swords in the Medieval Combat World Championships|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next world championship competition was held in 2015 at Malbork Castle, Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://malbork2015.pl/|title=IMCF World Championships|work=IMCF World Championships}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location for the 2016 IMCF world championship was in Portugal. In 2017 the tournament was held in [[Spottrup]],Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cronicasbohurteras.com/en/imcf-world-championship-2017-pools-competition-trees-and-schedule/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules and objectives==
Rules for competitions draw closely on original medieval texts outlining sport (i.e. non-lethal) tournament combat, such as [[King René's Tournament Book]] from 1460. Where original information is not available, or would present too great a risk to those fighting, new rules can be devised by an international team of referees, or ''marshals'', to be voted upon by fighters. As a young sport, rules are regularly updated in response to observations during competitions and subsequently rules of fighting may vary somewhat year-by-year.

==Armour==
All fighters must wear historical steel armour that encloses the torso, limbs, head &amp; neck, &amp; hands, and beneath this a padded layer, known as a [[gambeson]]. Helmets must be analogous to the rest of the armour, must cover the face and must be closed with a strap to prevent removal during combat. All armour must be of a style traceable to a historical period and location, no piece may date from more than 50 years of another. Fighters may wear a supplementary third layer of protective equipment beneath their gambeson, provided it is not visible and does not replace any armour above it, such as a [[Protective Cup]] or [[mouthguard]].

==Weapons==
All weapons are reproductions based on historical originals. These originals may be found in museums or drawings traceable to the period. All weapons must be blunt and within a set weight and size category, dependent upon the weapon. Metal maces, axes, swords (including [[falchions]]) and [[polearms]] are all permitted in group fights, while [[war hammers]] and weapons with hammer attachments may not be used in international events.

==Shields==
Shields are commonly used as weapons as much as a swords and other such medieval arms, with fighters choosing to combine strikes from their primary weapon alongside punches with their shield. Subsequently, shields are regulated as weapons. While being historical in design, shields must also meet a minimum weight requirement and not have narrow, sharp or metal edges.

==Training and preparation==
As with all combat or full contact sports, preparation and training is a crucial part of a team's approach to competition. Despite the importance of physical training for the sport, no single training regime tailored for the physical demands of fighting in armour survives from the medieval period, and subsequently competitors often combine occasional sparring with a variety of physical training techniques.

An active member of the Canadian-Hungarian community, Imre has served as the President and founder of the Hungarian Students' Association at the University of Toronto (2002–2005); Vice-President of the Albert Apponyi Association (2000–2010);&lt;ref&gt;Government Office for Hungarian Minorities Abroad&lt;/ref&gt; and on the Board of Directors of several Hungarian organizations including the [http://www.kmosz.ca/ National Alliance of Hungarians in Canada (NAHC)].&lt;ref&gt;National Alliance of Hungarians in Canada&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Mr. Imre was awarded the Order of the Knights Cross from the 1956 Hungarian Freedom Fighters Association in [[Hungary]]. Mr. Imre is a member of the [http://friendsofhungary.hu/rolunk-en Friends of Hungary Foundation].

Imre graduated from the [[University of Toronto]] with an Honours Bachelor of Arts in history and political science in 2005. Upon completion of postgraduate studies at the [[University of Oxford]] (2006) he completed a master's degree in history from the [[University of Bristol]] (2007) with distinction. In 2009, Joseph completed a graduate diploma in comparative politics from the [[London School of Economics]]. Imre is a member of the [http://www.pmi.org Project Management Institute (PMI)] where he holds additional certification in project management.

Mr. Imre has written extensively on [[medieval]], early modern, and modern European history. While his academic focus is primarily [[Renaissance]] studies and the religious history of 15th century Italy, Mr. Imre has also published widely on 20th century Hungarian historiography, and the issue of Hungarian minorities in the Carpathian Basin. His graduate dissertation on [[Girolamo Savonarola]] linked the controversial figure to humanistic elements in Renaissance society and challenged existing scholarship. In his capacity as a historian, Mr. Imre regularly contributes to a number of newspapers and online blogs as a columnist and contributor. Mr. Imre is an editor with the NAHC.

Mr. Imre and his wife, Mrs. Jazmin Bansagi, also own and operate a farm in [[Lennox and Addington County]] in eastern [[Ontario]]. [http://7fieldsfarm.com Seven Fields Farm &amp; Orchard] was founded on organic principles and sustainable approaches to stewardship that protect the land and environment. Seven Fields Farm &amp; Orchard operates a walnut and apple orchard, hay production, and the raising of beef cattle in co-operation with other farms in the area.

'''Limping bimetallism''' was a [[monetary system]] in the United States that was partially dependent on [[silver]] but primarily dependent on [[gold]]. It was developed after the abandonment of [[bimetallism]] and the adoption of the [[gold standard]] in 1873. The [[Bland–Allison Act]] of 1878 allowed the coining of new [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]]s, thus creating this system. Contrary to popular belief, the limping standard was not abandoned upon enactment of the [[Gold Standard Act]] of 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Ira B. ''Money and Banking''.

[[Taganrog]], on the [[Black Sea]] in the [[Kuban]] area, [[Rostov Oblast]], of [[Russia]] is of high historical importance relative to its small size, and relatedly has unusual memorials.  The city was founded, like St. Petersburg later, to provide Russia with a seaport.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4857">'''Luiz Francisco Rebello''' (September 10, 1924; [[Lisbon]] – December 8, 2011; Lisbon) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[lawyer]], [[playwright]], drama critic, theatrical historian, translator and essayist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://expresso.sapo.pt/morreu-luiz-francisco-rebello-1924-2011=f693300|title= Morreu o dramaturgo Luiz Francisco Rebello |last=[[Lusa news agency]]|date=08.12.2011|publisher=[[Público (Portugal)]]|language=Portuguese|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luiz Francisco Rebello is the most credited Portuguese theatrical historian, being the author of works published on Portuguese theatrical history and theatre criticism and he is a prolific playwright.&lt;ref name="fl"&gt;{{cite web|author=Coelho, Rui Pina|url=http://www.fl.ul.pt/centros_invst/teatro/pagina/Publicacoes/artigos2008/RPC_updating_the_experiment.htm|title=Updating the Experiment:Two Portuguese Theatre Anthologies|publisher=Centro de Estudos de Teatro|accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Rebello was a founder and a member of the direction of several experimental theatre groups, becoming one of the founders of the “Teatro-Estúdio do Salitre” in 1946 along with [[Gino Saviotti]] and in 1948 founded the “Companheiros do Páteo das Comédias”, two of the most important experimental groups of the post-war period.&lt;ref name="fl"/&gt; Together with [[José Saramago]], [[Armindo Magalhães]], [[Manuel da Fonseca]] and [[Urbano Tavares Rodrigues]] Rebello was, in 1992, one of the founders of the [[National Front for the Defense of Culture]] (Frente Nacional para a Defesa da Cultura) (BDNF).

His noted anthology ''Teatro Moderno: Caminhos e figuras'' was first published in short volumes at irregular periods during the year of 1957 by “Círculo do Livro”, a label that belonged to [[Vítor Palla]] (1922–2006) and [[Orlando Costa]] (1929–2006).&lt;ref name="fl"/&gt;  The 2nd edition, published in 1964, was printed on the label “Prelo”, on a theatre collection directed by Rebello himself. In the 1964 edition he added new essays such as those by Shaw, Jarry, Synge, Piscator, Oskar Schlemmer, Meyerhold, Giraudoux and Sartre.&lt;ref name="fl"/&gt;

He obtained a law degree from the [[University of Lisbon]] and chaired the [[Portuguese Society of Authors]] (Sociedade Portuguesa de Autores) for 30 years from 1973 to 2003, specializing in the area of copyright. He was also vice president of the [[International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers]].&lt;ref name="CET"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firt2009lisboa.org/firt/speakers/cv_rebello.pdf|title=Luiz Francisco Rebello|publisher=Centro de Estudos de Teatro|accessdate=December 4, 2009}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Rebello was appointed director of the [[Teatro São Luiz]] in Lisbon, a position that he would resign the following year because of censorship disagreements.&lt;ref name="CET"/&gt;  Rebello has been a contributor to numerous newspapers and magazines, including the ''[[Colóquio-Letras]]'',  ''[[Jornal de Letras]]'',  ''[[Seara Nova]]'' and ''[[Vértice]]''.&lt;ref name="CET"/&gt; Since 1971, he has also contributed to the ''[[Dicionário do Teatro Português]]'', the dictionary of Portuguese theatre. He has also translated the work of several influential playwrights, including [[William Shakespeare]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[August Strindberg]], and [[Henrik Ibsen]].&lt;ref name="fl"/&gt;

==Acclaim==
Rebello has received many prestigious awards including [[Ordem do Infante D. Henrique]] (1985),  the insignia of the Knight of the [[Order of National Merit]] (1991) which was granted by the French Minister of Communication [[George Kiejemann]], and the [[Order of Merit (Portugal)|Order of Merit]] (1995), given by Dr. [[Mário Soares]] and also received the [[Prémio da Sociedade Portuguesa de Autores]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="CET"/&gt;

[[File:Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_Netherlands.svg|thumb|The [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands|arms of the Dutch monarch]] feature a pavilion and mantle]]

In heraldry, the '''mantle''' is a symbol of sovereign power and is generally reserved for royalty. In some cases its use has also been granted to other nobles, in recognition of particular merits. In ordinary rendering the mantle is usually crimson and lined with ermine. Certain arms may also display a '''pavilion''' surmounting the mantle.

The pavilion is said to be the invention of the Frenchman Philip Moreau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fox-Davies|first1=Arthur Charles|title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry|date=1909|publisher=T.C. &amp; E.C. Jack|location=London &amp; Edinburgh|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While common in continental European heraldry, the mantle and pavilion is absent in British heraldry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fox-Davies|first1=Arthur Charles|title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry|date=1909|publisher=T.C. &amp; E.C. Jack|location=London &amp; Edinburgh|page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Melvin Kranzberg''' (November 22, 1917 – December 6, 1995) was an American [[historian]], and professor of history at [[Case Western Reserve University]] from 1952 until 1971. He was a Callaway professor of the history of technology at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] from 1972 to 1988.

Born in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], Kranzberg graduated from [[Amherst College]], received a master's and a PhD from [[Harvard University]] and served in the Army in Europe during World War II. He received a Bronze Star for interrogating captured German prisoners and learning the location of Nazi gun emplacements. He was one of two interrogators out of nine in Patton's army that were not killed during the conflict.

Kranzberg is known for his laws of technology, the first of which states "Technology is neither good nor bad; ''nor is it neutral''."

He was one of the founders of the [[Society for the History of Technology]] in the US and long-time editor of its journal ''[[Technology and Culture]]''. Kranzberg served as president of the society from 1983 to 1984, and edited the society's journal from 1959 to 1981, when he turned it over to Robert C. Post of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The society awards a yearly $4000 fellowship named after Kranzberg to doctoral students engaged in the preparation of dissertations on the history of technology. The award is available to students all over the world. In 1967 Kranzberg was awarded the [[Leonardo da Vinci Medal]] by the Society for the History of Technology.

[[Howard Segal|Howard P. Segal]] wrote an informative semi-biographical tribute to Kranzberg in [[the Virginia Quarterly Review]].&lt;ref name="VQR"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segal|first1=Howard P.|title=Technology, History, and Culture: An Appreciation of Melvin Kranzberg|journal=The Virginia Quarterly Review|date=Autumn 1998|volume=74|issue=4|url=http://www.vqronline.org/issues/74/4/autumn-1998|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two biographical articles by Robert C. Post in [[Technology and Culture]]:
* "Back at the Start: History and Technology and Culture," T&amp;C 51 (2010): 961-94
* "Chance and Contingency: Putting Mel Kranzberg in Context," T&amp;C 50 (2009): 839-72.

Kranzberg helped found [[International Committee for the History of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Post|first=Robert C.|date=2014|title=Our Mel Kranzberg: Risks He Took, Stumbles, and Sometimes a Second Thought|jstor=23788083|journal=Icon|volume=20|issue=1|pages=6–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melvin Kranzberg's six laws of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kranzberg|first1=Melvin|title=Technology and History: "Kranzberg's Laws"|journal=Technology and Culture|date=July 1986|volume=27|issue=3|pages=544–560|doi=10.2307/3105385}}&lt;/ref&gt; state:

#Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.
#Invention is the mother of necessity
#Technology comes in packages, big and small.
#Although technology might be a prime element in many public issues, nontechnical factors take precedence in technology-policy decisions.
#All history is relevant, but the history of technology is the most relevant.
#Technology is a very human activity - and so is the history of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/Tech-OV1.htm |title=Technology and the History of Aeronautics: An Essay |first=James R |last=Hansen |publisher=U.S. Centennial of Flight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of numerous Meroitic sites within the western Butana region and on the border of Butana proper is significant to the settlement of the core of the developed region. The orientation of these settlements exhibit the exercise of state power over subsistence production.&lt;ref name="jstor183595"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Meroe and the Sudanic Kingdoms |author=Edwards, David N. |journal=[[The Journal of African History]] |volume=39 |issue=2 |date=1998 |pages=175–193 |jstor=183595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdom of Kush which housed the city of Meroë represents one of a series of early states located within the middle Nile. It is one of the earliest and most impressive states found south of the Sahara. Looking at the specificity of the surrounding early states within the middle Nile, one's understanding of Meroë in combination with the historical developments of other historic states may be enhanced through looking at the development of power relation characteristics within other Nile Valley states.&lt;ref name="jstor183595"/&gt;

The site of the city of Meroë is marked by more than two hundred [[pyramid]]s in three groups, of which many are in ruins. They have the distinctive size and proportions of [[Nubian pyramids]].

== History ==

[[File:Amanitore bust.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Relief of a ruler, a [[Candace of Meroë]] named [[Amanitore|Kandake Amanitore]]]]
Meroë was the south capital of the [[Napata]]/Meroitic Kingdom, that spanned the period c. 800 BCE&amp;nbsp;– c. 350 CE.&lt;ref name="Török1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Török|first=László |title=The Kingdom of Kush: Handbook of the Napatan-Meroitic Civilization|url={{google books|id=i54rPFeGKewC|plainurl=yes|keywords=Meroe}}|series=Handbuch der Orientalistik. Erste Abteilung, Nahe und der Mittlere Osten |volume=Vol. 31 |year=1997|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=90-04-10448-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to partially deciphered Meroitic texts, the name of the city was '''Medewi''' or '''Bedewi'''. Excavations revealed evidence of important, high ranking Kushite burials, from the Napatan Period (c. 800 – c. 280 BCE) in the vicinity of the settlement called the Western cemetery. The culture of Meroë developed from the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty]] of [[Ancient Egypt]], which originated in [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]. The importance of the town gradually increased from [[Kingdom of Kush|the beginning of the Meroitic Period]], especially from the reign of [[Arakamani]] (c. 280 BCE) when the royal burial ground was transferred to Meroë from [[Napata]] ([[Gebel Barkal]]). In the fifth century BCE, Greek historian [[Herodotus]] described it as "a great city...said to be the mother city of the other Ethiopians."&lt;ref name="Herodotus1949"&gt;{{cite book|author=Herodotus|authorlink=Herodotus|title=Herodotus.

[[File:NE 200bc.jpg|thumb|280px|Near East in 200 BCE, showing the Kingdom of Meroe and its neighbours.]]
Rome's conquest of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] led to border skirmishes and incursions by Meroë beyond the Roman borders. In 23 BCE the Roman governor of Egypt, [[Gaius Petronius|Publius Petronius]], to end the Meroitic raids, invaded Nubia in response to a Nubian attack on southern Egypt, pillaging the north of the region and sacking Napata (22 BCE) before returning home. In retaliation, the Nubians crossed the lower border of Egypt and looted many statues (among other things) from the Egyptian towns near the first cataract of the Nile at Aswan. Roman forces later reclaimed many of the statues intact, and others were returned following the peace treaty signed in 22 BCE between Rome and Meroë under [[Augustus]] and [[Amanirenas]], respectively. One looted head though, from a statue of the emperor [[Augustus]], was buried under the steps of a temple. It is now kept in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/b/bronze_head_of_augustus.aspx|title=Bronze head of Augustus|publisher=[[British Museum]]|year=1999|accessdate=2008-06-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210114958/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/b/bronze_head_of_augustus.aspx|archivedate=10 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next recorded contact between Rome and Meroë was in the autumn of 61 CE. The Emperor [[Nero]] sent a party of Praetorian soldiers under the command of a tribune and two centurions into this country, who reached the city of Meroë where they were given an escort, then proceeded up the [[White Nile]] until they encountered the swamps of the [[Sudd]]. This marked the limit of Roman penetration into Africa.&lt;ref name="Kirwan1957"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Kirwan|first= L.P.  | title = Rome beyond The Southern Egyptian Frontier | journal = [[The Geographical Journal]] | volume = 123 | year = 1957 | pages = 13–19 | location = London| publisher = Royal Geographical Society, with the Institute of British Geographers | jstor=1790717  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period following Petronius' punitive expedition is marked by abundant trade finds at sites in Meroë. L.P. Kirwan provides a short list of finds from archeological sites in that country.&lt;ref name="Kirwan1957" /&gt;{{rp|18f}} However, the kingdom of Meroë began to fade as a power by the 1st or 2nd century CE, sapped by the war with Roman Egypt and the decline of its traditional industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/3chapter4.shtml |title="Nubia", '&amp;#39;BBC World Service'&amp;#39; |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meroë is mentioned succinctly in the 1st century CE [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]:
{{quote|2. On the right-hand coast next below [[Berenice]] is the country of the Berbers. Along the shore are the Fish-Eaters, living in scattered caves in the narrow valleys.

a stele of [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] of a unnamed ruler of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]] thought of as ([[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]]) was found at the site of Meroë; from his description, in [[Greek language|Greek]], that he was "King of the [[Aksumite]]s and the [[Himyarite|Omerites]]," (i.e. of [[Aksum]] and [[Himyar]]) it is likely this king ruled sometime around 330. While some authorities interpret these inscriptions as proof that the Axumites destroyed the kingdom of [[Meroe]], others note that archeological evidence points to an economic and political decline in Meroe around 300.&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munro-Hay|first=Stuart C. |title=Aksum: An African Civilisation of Late Antiquity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RlRzAAAAMAAJ|year=1991|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=978-0-7486-0106-6|pp=79, 224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, some view the stele as military aid from Aksum to Meroe to quell down the revolt and rebellion by the Nuba. However, conclusive evidence and proof to which view is correct is not currently present.

=== Meroë in Hebrew legend ===
Hebrew oral tradition avers that [[Moses]], in his younger years, had led an Egyptian military expedition into Sudan (Kush), as far as the city of Meroë, which was then called Saba. The city was built near the confluence of two great rivers and was encircled by a formidable wall, and governed by a renegade king.  To ensure the safety of his men who traversed that desert country, Moses had invented a stratagem whereby the Egyptian army would carry along with them baskets of sedge, each containing an ibis, only to be released when they approached the enemy's country. The purpose of the birds was to kill the deadly serpents that lay all about that country.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'', ii.x.ii.&lt;/ref&gt; Having successfully laid siege to the city, the city was eventually subdued by betrayal of the king's daughter, who had agreed to deliver the city unto Moses on condition that he would consummate a marriage with her, under the solemn assurance of an oath.{{efn|The same episode, with slight variation, is also related in ''Sefer Ha-Yashar'', Tel-Aviv ca. 1965, pp. 192–195 (Hebrew) and in [[Gedaliah ibn Yahya]]'s [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/6618 ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah''], Jerusalem 1962, p. 22 (p. 31 in PDF) (Hebrew); ''Pseudo-Jonathan'' – ''the Aramaic Targum of pseudo-Jonathan ben Uziel'' (ed.

Meroë was the base of a flourishing kingdom whose wealth was centered around a strong [[iron]] industry, as well as international trade involving [[India]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Stoffera[h]n, Steven &amp; Wood, Sarah | editor = Rauh, Nicholas K. | year = 2016 | orig-year = 2003 | title = Lecture 30: Ancient Africa [CLCS 181: Classical World Civilizations] | format = student lecture notes | location = West Lafayette, IN | publisher =Purdue University, School of Languages and Cultures | url = http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~rauhn/ancient_africa.htm | access-date = February 28, 2017 | &lt;!-- Lectures contributed by Steve Stofferan [''sic.''] and Sarah Wood, Purdue University the misspelling of the lead author Stofferahn's name at the primary source is corrected based on his student record, see below.

The centralized control of production within the Meroitic empire and distribution of certain crafts and manufactures may have been politically important with their iron industry and pottery crafts gaining the most significant attention. The Meroitic settlements were oriented in a savannah orientation with the varying of permanent and less permanent agricultural settlements can be attributed to the exploitation of rainlands and savannah-oriented forms of subsistence.&lt;ref name="jstor183595"/&gt;

At the time, iron was one of the most important metals worldwide, and Meroitic metalworkers were among the best in the world. Meroë also exported [[textiles]] and [[jewelry]]. Their textiles were based on [[cotton]] and working on this product reached its highest achievement in Nubia around 400 BCE. Furthermore, [[Nubia]] was very rich in [[gold]]. It is possible that the Egyptian word for [[Gold (hieroglyph)|gold]], ''nub'', was the source of name of [[Nubia]]. Trade in "exotic" animals from farther south in Africa was another feature of their economy.

Apart from the iron trade, pottery was a widespread and prominent industry in the Meroe kingdom. The production of fine and elaborated decorated wares was a strong tradition within the middle nile. Such productions carried considerable social significance and are believed to be involved in mortuary rites. The long history of goods imported into the Meroitic empire and their subsequent distribution provides insight into the social and political workings of the Meroitic state. The major determinant of production was attributed to the availability of labor rather than the political power associated with land. Power was associated with control of people rather than control of territory.&lt;ref name="jstor183595"/&gt;

The Egyptian import, the water-moving wheel, the [[sakia]], was used to move water, in conjunction with irrigation, to increase crop production.&lt;ref name="BerneyRing1996"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Berney|editor1-first=K. A.|editor2-last=Ring|editor2-first=Trudy |title=International Dictionary of Historic Places|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R44VRnNCzAYC&amp;pg=PA506|volume=Vol. 4: Middle East and Africa|year=1996|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|isbn=978-1-884964-03-9|page=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak, the rulers of Meroë controlled the Nile Valley north to south, over a straight-line distance of more than {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Adams1977"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=William Yewdale |title=Nubia: Corridor to Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f84VAQAAIAAJ|year=1977|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-09370-3|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The King of Meroë was an autocratic ruler who shared his authority only with the Queen Mother, or [[Candace]]. However, the role of the Queen Mother remains obscure. The administration consisted of [[treasury|treasurers]], seal bearers, heads of [[archives]] and chief [[scribe]]s, among others.

Although the people of Meroë also had southern deities such as [[Apedemak]], the lion-son of [[Sekhmet]] (or [[Bast (mythology)|Bast]], depending upon the region), they also continued worshipping ancient Egyptian gods that they had brought with them. Among these deities were [[Amun]], [[Tefnut]], [[Horus]], [[Isis]], [[Thoth]] and [[Satet|Satis]], though to a lesser extent.

The collapse of their external trade with other Nile Valley states may be considered as one of the prime causes of the decline of royal power and disintegration of the Meroitic state in the 3rd and 4th centuries CE.&lt;ref name="jstor183595"/&gt;

The [[Meroitic language]] was spoken in Meroë and the Sudan during the Meroitic period (attested from 300 BCE). It became extinct about 400 CE. The language was written in two forms of the [[Meroitic alphabet]]: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a [[stylus]] and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of [[bilingual]] texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180-170 BCE. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen [[Shanakdakhete]]. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally, and reads from right to left like all Semitic orthographies.&lt;ref name="Howf"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Steven Roger|title=History of Writing|date=2004|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1861895887|pages=133–134|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=iYMXnSko5QwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 3rd century BCE, a new indigenous [[alphabet]], the [[Meroitic alphabet|Meroitic]], consisting of twenty-three letters, replaced Egyptian script. The [[Meroitic script]] is an [[alphabetic]] script originally derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs, used to write the [[Meroitic language]] of the Kingdom of Meroë/[[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]. It was developed in the Napatan Period (about 700 - 300 BCE), and first appears in the 2nd century BCE. For a time, it was also possibly used to write the [[Old Nubian language|Nubian language]] of the successor Nubian kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/nubia/mwriting.html |title="Meroe: Writing", '&amp;#39;Digital Egypt,'&amp;#39; University College, London |publisher=Digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncertain to which language family the Meroitic language is related. Claude Rilly has proposed that it, like the [[Nobiin language]], belongs to the [[Eastern Sudanic languages|Eastern Sudanic]] branch of the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family.&lt;ref name="RillyVoogt2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rilly|first1=Claude |last2=de Voogt|first2=Alex |title=The Meroitic Language and Writing System|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mHdD_YojtaMC&amp;pg=PA67|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-00866-3|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rilly, Claude | year = 2004 | url = http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/projets/clhass/PageWeb/ressources/Isolats/Meroitic%20Rilly%202004.pdf  | title = The Linguistic Position of Meroitic | journal = Sudan Electronic Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology}}{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}} Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic, like the [[Egyptian language]], instead belongs to the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family.

The site of Meroë was brought to the knowledge of Europeans in 1821 by the French mineralogist [[Frédéric Cailliaud]] (1787–1869), who published an illustrated in-folio describing the ruins. His work included the first publication of the southernmost known Latin inscription.{{efn|{{CIL|03|83}}. This inscription was subsequently published by Lepsius, who brought the stone back to Berlin.

The '''Mills Archive''' was established in 2002 to preserve and protect records of [[Mill (grinding)|mill]]ing [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and to make them freely available to the public. It is governed by the '''Mills Archive Trust''', which is a [[charitable organization|charity]] that is based at [[Watlington House]], [[Reading, Berkshire]].

==History==
The Mills Archive Trust was established in 2002.&lt;ref name=Found/&gt;&lt;ref name=HLf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bri.ucla.edu/nha/sthc/sth02058.htm |title=Online: the Mills Archive Trust (traditional mills and milling) |publisher=University of California, Los Angeles |accessdate=3 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716085018/http://www.bri.ucla.edu/nha/sthc/sth02058.htm |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A grant of £50,000 from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] enabled the Archive to launch its internet catalogue in 2003.&lt;ref name=Found/&gt; Other early supporters of the trust included the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] (SPAB),&lt;ref name=Watts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craftsintheenglishcountryside.org.uk/pdfs/Millwrighting.pdf |title=Milling and millwrighting |first=Martin |last=Watts |publisher=Crafts in the English countryside |accessdate=3 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hampshire Mills Group, which donated £200.&lt;ref name=Found&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hampshiremills.org/HMG%20Activity.htm |title=HMG Activity - 1 |publisher=Hampshire Mills Group |accessdate=3 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archive was set up in response to an expressed need to preserve and where possible integrate the various threatened sources of information on the windmills and watermills of the UK and the rest of the world. It was hoped to prevent material being lost on the death of a [[molinology|molinologist]] by creating a suitable repository.&lt;ref name=Skip&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timsmills.info/Journal/BULLET65.HTM |title=Journal of The International Molinological Society No. 65, December 2002 / summary - résumé |publisher=The International Molinological Society |accessdate=3 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Chairman Dr Ron Cookson was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for Services to Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind and watermill enthusiast receives MBE|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-18460357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally a Charitable Trust (Reg no 1091534), the Trust became a Foundation-style Charitable Incorporated Organisation (Reg no 1155828) in February 2014. In November 2016 the Archive was awarded the status of a Nationally Accredited Archive Service.

[[File:Archive-accred-weblogo.jpg|thumb|center]]

==Aims==
The Archive aims to focus on (but not be totally restricted to) traditional mills and milling, and seeks to acquire relevant historical and contemporary documentary and illustrative material and small artefacts. The main initial priority is records relating to UK mills, millers and millwrights, chiefly during the 18th–21st centuries, but the Archive plans to extend its coverage worldwide.

"Traditional mills" include mills, similar structures and industrial processes that are or were powered by wind, water, muscle or other power sources, but not the massive modern industrial mills used for steel production and similar large-scale industrial enterprises. "Milling" includes millwrighting and the place of the mill in social and economic as well as technological and architectural history.

==Collections and services==
The Mills Archive was originally set up to care for four historically important Foundation Collections: those belonging to the SPAB, Mildred Cookson, [[Ken Major]] and Alan Stoyel. Since its establishment it has been given more than 40 further collections, both large and small.

The Archive currently holds more than 2,000,000 items, most of which can be freely inspected by appointment at the Research Centre at Watlington House. Its [http://catalogue.millsarchive.org/ catalogue] is free to use, contains some 50,000 records and is rapidly expanding. The Archive also maintains a library containing more than 2,000 books on mills, in various languages. Most have been added to the [https://millsarchive.org/explore/library online library catalogue]. Apart from its wide use as a source of information about mills and their machinery in archival documents, books and journals,&lt;ref name=Beacham&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beacham, M. |title=Variations on a theme: the English Midlands-type post mill |journal=International molinology |issue=77 |year=2008 |pages=9–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blythman&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blythman, G. |title=Upper Dean Windmill |journal=Mill news |issue=120 |year=2009 |pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bonwick&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bonwick, L. |title=The Kent miller's tale |journal=International molinology |issue=76 |year=2008 |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bonwick2&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bonwick, L. |title=Frank Gregory online |journal=Mill news |issue=120 |year=2009 |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Howes&gt;{{cite book |last=Howes |first=H. |title=The Windmills and watermills of Bedfordshire: past, present and future |publisher=Book Castle |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jager&gt;{{cite book |last=Jager |first=D. |title=Windmills of Lincolnshire |publisher=Heritage Lincolnshire |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ogden&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ogden, D. |title=Cann Mill |journal=Mill news |issue=120 |year=2009 |pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yoward&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yoward, A. |title=Archiving our mills |journal=Industrial archaeology news |issue=124 |year=2003 |pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Mills Archive has become a focus for family history researchers.&lt;ref name=Cookson&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cookson, R. &amp; Hudson.

A '''moneyer''' is a private individual who is officially permitted to mint [[money]]. Usually the rights to coin money are bestowed as a [[Concession (contract)|concession]] by a state or government. Moneyers have a long tradition, dating back at least to [[ancient Greece]]. They became most prominent in the [[Roman Republic]], and continued into the [[Roman_Empire|Empire]].

Moneyers were not limited to the ancient world.  When European coinage was revived during the Middle Ages, moneyers again were trusted to create currency on behalf of kings and potentates.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Grierson, Philip Raymond Grierson, Mark Blackburn, 2007.

'''Murat Belge''' (born March 16, 1943) is a Turkish academic, translator, [[literary critic]], columnist, [[civil rights activist]], and occasional tour guide.

== Career ==

Belge was a member of the organizing committee for a two-day academic conference that started on September 24, 2005, held at [[Bilgi University]] in Istanbul, titled "Ottoman Armenians During the Decline of the Empire: Issues of Scientific Responsibility and Democracy".&lt;ref name=harvey&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference offered an open dispute of the official Turkish account of the [[Armenian Genocide]], and was denounced by [[Turkish nationalism|nationalists]] as treacherous.&lt;ref name=harvey/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Mahoney|url=http://www.cpj.org/Briefings/2006/turkey_3-06/turkey_3-06.html |title=Turkey: Nationalism and the Press|publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]]|date=2006-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belge's remarks led to his facing a ten-year jail sentence for criticizing the judicial ban; he was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifex.org/en/content/view/full/74950 Court acquits fifth journalist who criticised conference ban], [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange|IFEX]]. 9 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto Brahm''' (born '''Otto Abrahamson''' on 5 February 1856 in [[Hamburg]]; died 28 November 1912 in [[Berlin]]) was a [[Germany|German]] drama and [[literary criticism|literary critic]], theatre manager and director. His productions were noted for being accurate and realistic. He was involved in the foundation of the progressive ''[[Die Freie Bühne]]'' (English: ''Free Stage'') company, of which he became president and producer. He also edited the company's weekly magazine of the same name, but later changed its name to ''[[Neue Rundschau|Die neue Rundschau]]''.

Brahm also managed the [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]] in Berlin, and was responsible for modernising its output.

From [[Heinz Herald]]'s memoir of [[Max Reinhardt]] entitled ''[[Bildnis Eines Theater-Mannes]]'', regarding the birth of modern theatre: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In Germany, the explosion came in 1889, embodied by Otto Brahm. Her place was the newly grounded vacant stage, her occasion is the premiere of a young unknown poet. His name was [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], his play ''Before Sunrise''. Opinions collapsed, as the representatives of a tradition-bound art calcified with the glowing, indomitable, new style. A well-known Berlin doctor swung a symbolic and a little rude noose after the curtain had fallen. A battle raged, but soon it became clear as day that naturalism had triumphed here on the whole line.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The confirmation of this victory occurred when Brahm shortly afterwards took over the direction of the [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]], which at that time was still considered to be the leader in Berlin and the Reich. But even Otto Brahm could not fulfill the theoretical ideal of consistent naturalism because it was and is unfulfillable. . . . Art, even naturalistic art, is a choice, omission. The verdict that was literally painted on Brahm’s stage, "art and nature are one only," could not be realized.

Brahm saw this too soon. His house-poets, led by [[Ibsen]] and Hauptmann, supplied him with pieces that one could by no means call naturalistic. They used more naturalistic means, but they also omitted and increased. . . . . [However] there was no longer a stilted language, no idealized decoration, no off-the-ground stage style. The Brahms theater was true, honest, decent, manly. One did not pretend in Brahm’s theatre, one played as lifelike as possible. A great ensemble helped Otto Brahm with this effort. Every time an elementary new stage personality appears, a keen actor seems to form itself around this center. Here were the best Rittner, Sauer, Hermann Muller, Bassermann and [[Else Lehmann]]: performers who met exactly the Brahmian style of the naturalness, truthfulness, sober behavior. Through hotly controversial Hauptmann's first performances and many pieces of the naturalistic period, Brahm and his cast rose to what they undoubtedly considered to be the pinnacle of their achievement: the peculiar and pompous cycle of Ibsen.

[However], Brahm was not a director. This position, which is unknown in our current sense, was more the role of a subaltern. Brahm sat in on the rehearsals in the dark auditorium and tried to bring his actors to where he wanted them by talking after rehearsing. He was a brilliant dramaturg. He was in close contact with his authors, selected the pieces for his playing schedule, occupied them, found and hired new ensemble members. A young actor of his theater, who had noticed him on a short visit to Salzburg and stayed with him for almost a decade, was called [[Max Reinhardt]].” 12-14

==Life==
Papiya Ghosh was born on 8 October 1953, in [[Dumka]] ([[Bihar]], [[India]]). She was the third of four daughters of Ujjal Kumar Ghosh, an IAS officer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purnujjalpapiyaghoshmemorialtrust.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723171304/http://www.purnujjalpapiyaghoshmemorialtrust.com/ |archivedate=23 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}, www.purnujjalpapiyaghoshmemorialtrust.com, accessed on 26 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; of the Bihar Cadre, and his wife Purnima Ghosh. Her father was a victim of what was widely held to be a political murder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purnujjalpapiyaghoshmemorialtrust.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723171304/http://www.purnujjalpapiyaghoshmemorialtrust.com/ |archivedate=23 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}, www.purnujjalpapiyaghoshmemorialtrust.com, accessed on 26 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in 1957. The four sisters were subsequently brought up by their mother, who took up a job as a school teacher to support her daughters after the murder of her husband.

Papiya attended St Joseph's Convent High School in Patna, where she was school topper and elected Head Girl in 1971. She earned an undergraduate degree in History from the [[Patna Women's College]] ([[Patna University]])&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Patna]], www.wikipedia.org, accessed on 8 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and was also elected Premier of the Students' Union. Papiya was an avid debater, dramatist and writer from an early age, and, together with her sister Tuktuk, became something of a household name as a regular contributor to [[Kookie Kol]], a column in the [[The Statesman (India)|Junior Statesman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boloji.com/opinion/0278.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103020/http://www.boloji.com/opinion/0278.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}, www.boloji.com, accessed on 26 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which was a popular youth magazine of the time.

As [[Patna University]] was closed down indefinitely in 1975 during [[Jayaprakash Narayan]]'s agitation, Papiya Ghosh moved to [[Delhi University]] where she completed her MPhil and PhD, studying the pre-independence civil disobedience movement in Bihar (1930–34). After her PhD, she taught History at [[Delhi University]] for two years. In 1979, she decided to move back to Patna. This was in part to support her mother, who was by then living on her own, but also because she wanted to live and work in the midst of the land, people and society which formed the main focus of her academic research.

In Patna, Papiya taught first at Patna Women's College and then at the history department at Patna University. A highly regarded teacher, she took great personal pains to ensure that the content and quality of instruction her students received was at par with the best universities in the country. This was especially challenging given the general decline of standards at Patna University, the very limited funding available, deteriorating facilities, and official indifference.

Professional recognition was hard to come by, given the situation in Patna and its remoteness from the more high-profile academic centres of India. Nevertheless, she was awarded the prestigious Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship (twice), as well as fellowships from the [[Indian Institute of Advanced Study]] (Shimla) and [[Teen Murti Bhavan]] (New Delhi). She also contributed a number of scholarly articles to prestigious academic journals.

A follower of the philosopher [[Rumi]], Papiya Ghosh was drawn towards [[Sufi]] mysticism, which she saw as a unique amalgam of influences truly representative the assimilative culture of the Indian sub-continent. She also had a keen interest in modern literature, especially writings by and about Indian and Pakistani women.

==Murder==
Papiya Ghosh was murdered on the night of 2/3 December 2006, along with her elderly maid, Malti Devi. The post-mortem report listed 34 stab wounds inflicted on her, including to the eyes, throat and stomach. Of the six men accused on the murder, four have been arrested, tried and convicted and two of the named accused, who were absconding, have since been arrested in August 2012 by Bihar Police. However, the trial in their case has yet to commence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.papiyaghosh.com/status.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727143641/http://www.papiyaghosh.com/status.asp |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}, www.papiyaghosh.com, accessed on 26 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
After her PhD, Papiya Ghosh taught History at Daulat Ram College (Delhi University) briefly, and then at the [[Hindu College, University of Delhi]] for two years. In 1979, she moved back to Patna, where she taught at her alma mater, Patna Women's College (Patna University), until 1991. She was subsequently promoted and moved to the Department of History, Patna University.

Her research subjects related, inter-alia, to the impact of Partition in 1947, the plight of Dalit Muslims, peoples' movements, popular syncretic culture, secularism, the contribution of the underprivileged to political processes etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/ComparativePolitics/IndiaPakistan/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195693003 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019091014/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/ComparativePolitics/IndiaPakistan/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195693003 |archivedate=19 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}, www.oup.com, accessed on 26 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; She was particularly interested in questions of identity, especially how people identify themselves individually and collectively when removed from their place of origin. She spent much of her time travelling to remote areas, meeting key sources (within and outside the country), and conducting first-hand primary research using her own limited resources. She would devote hours on translation, roping in friends and well-wishers to help. She taught herself to read and write [[Urdu]], as many of the manuscripts she studied were written in the [[Nastaliq]] script. She immersed herself in local traditions (many obscure, some dying out) and was also a keen student of diasporic sub-continental populations, both contemporary (such as the Bangladeshi population in London) and historical (such as in Mauritius and the West Indies).

She was:
* Rockefeller Fellow at the [[University of Chicago]], 1994;
* Rockefeller Fellow at the Triangle South Asia Consortium at [[North Carolina State University]], 1996–97;
* Fellow at the [[Indian Institute of Advanced Study]], Shimla (India), 1993–96

'''[[Persian Empire|Persian]]-[[Sassanide]] art patterns''' have similarities with the art of the [[Bulgars]], [[Khazars]], and Saka-[[Scythians]], and have recurred in Asia. They predominantly feature motifs of fighting animals. Gold was frequently used as a base for their art creations.

== Patterns ==
The characteristic patterns of [[Empire|Persian]]-[[Sassanide]] art exhibit similarities to the art of the [[Bulgars]],&lt;ref&gt;Bulgarian's Treasures from the past by Ivan Venedikov, Sava Boyadjiev and Dimiter Kartalev, Foreign Languages Press Sofia 1965, pp. 345-55&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khazars]], and Saka-[[Scythian]], and have recurred at different locations in the [[Central Asia]] region. A "[[griffin]] fighting an [[elk]]" motif from the [[Treasure of Nagyszentmiklós]], found in 1799 in what is today [[Romania]], bears similarities with another griffin &amp; elk motif discovered in the tombs of [[Hsiung-nu]]&lt;ref&gt;The Empire of the Steppes, a History of Central Asia by Rene Grousset (transl. by Naomi Walford), Rutgers University Press, 2005, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; (early [[Huns]], also [[Xiongnu]]) during Colonel [[Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov]]&lt;ref&gt;Buddha: Radiant Awakening by Jackie Menzies, Sydney, Art Gallery of New South Wales, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wildlife of the Tibetan Steppe by George B. Schaller, University Of Chicago Press, 2000, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; expedition (1907–09) near [[Ulan Bator|Urga]] (Outer [[Mongolia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Discoveries of the Kozlov Expedition by W. Perceval Yetts, he Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Vol. 48, No. 277 (Apr., 1926), pp. 168-185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Pazirik Burial of Altai by Eugene A. Golomshtok, M. P. Griaznov in American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 37, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1933), pp. 30-45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Recent Russian Archaeological Exploration by W. E. D. Allen in The Geographical Journal, Vol. 69, No. 3 (Mar., 1927), pp. 262-264&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[gold]] symbolization of "animals-in-fight" has been also found in the vicinity of the city of [[Turpan]],&lt;ref&gt;The Old Silk Road - From Xi'an to Pamir, Chapter XIII: A Tour of Turpan by Bi Yading, Chinese Intercontinental Press (CIP) 2003, p.121 ({{ISBN|7-5032-2125-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; the principal crossroad of the northern [[Silk Road]]. [[Gold]]en "animals-in-fight" have also been identified as 3rd – 2nd century B.C. [[Mongolia]] (or southern [[Siberia]]), being characteristic of [[Hsiung-nu]] or [[Xiongnu]].

==The Art of the Nomads==

The early history of the [[Nomads]] is not well recorded, which changed after their contact with cultures possessing written history. [[Nomadic people]] of the vast steppes of [[Asia]] were a major force in history.&lt;ref&gt;The Perilous Frontier by Thomas J. Barfield, lackwell Publishers, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Their power was not in the empires they built, but rather the turmoil they created among [[ancient civilizations]] such as [[China]] or [[Persia]], impacting their historical development substantially.&lt;ref&gt;Warriors of the Steppe by Erik Hildinger, De Capo Press, 1997, pp. 57-92&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the [[nomads]] ranged widely, forever moving on for sake of richer grazing for their horses and sheep.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[Nomad|Migrations]] were often seasonal. Their skill at extracting [[gold]] was unprecedented.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In summer, during the tribe's seasonal migration, a [[Wool|fleece]] would be weighted on a riverbed to collect particles of [[alluvial]] [[gold]]. Upon the tribes' return, the [[Wool|fleece]] would be sheared, burned, and a [[gold]] ingot the size of a horse's hoof would result.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The ''tay tayak'' (the horse's hoof) was a unit of gold for a long period, which was used as a measure of an amount of golden metal rather than money, since gold was not fabricated as currency.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Using gold was a spiritual practice, as emblems of priestly office, prizes for physical prowess in ritual sport, or as adornment of the sacral ceremony of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Kazakhstan, Coming of Age by Michael Fergus and Janar Jandosova, Stacey International 2003, p.106 ({{ISBN|1-900988-615}})&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2185">'''Peter of Dusburg''' ({{lang-de|Peter von Dusburg}}; {{lang-la|Petrus de Dusburg}}; died after 1326), also known as '''Peter of Duisburg''', was a [[Priest]]-Brother and [[chronicler]] of the [[Teutonic Knights]]. He is known for writing the ''[[Chronicon terrae Prussiae]]'', which described the 13th and early 14th century Teutonic Knights and [[Old Prussians]] in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]].
==Life==
Peter's dates of birth and death are unknown, although he lived from the second half of the 13th century until the first half of the 14th century. Initially it was thought he was from [[Duisburg]], [[Germany]], and in some texts he is referred to as "Peter of Duisburg". Other research indicates he may have instead come from [[Doesburg]], now in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marzena Pollakówna|Pollakówna, Marzena]], ''Kronika Piotra z Dusburga'' ("The Chronicle of Peter of Dusburg"), Acta Poloniae Historica, [[Wrocław]], [[Warszawa]], [[Kraków]], vol. 19, p. 69-88. 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1324, probably while in [[Königsberg]],&lt;ref name="C224"&gt;Christiansen, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Peter began working on his ''Chronicon terrae Prussiae'' on behalf of Grand Master [[Werner von Orseln]].  By 1326, he had finished expanding upon the now-lost work of a Latinist who had written about the campaigns of the early [[Prussian Crusade]].&lt;ref name="C224"/&gt; That version was subsequently revised to include events up to 1330.

From 1331-35, [[Nikolaus von Jeroschin]] translated Peter's chronicle into [[Middle High German]] on behalf of Grand Master [[Luther von Braunschweig]].

'''Philippe-Charles''' or '''Philip Carel Schmerling''' (2 March 1791 [[Delft]] &amp;ndash; 7 November 1836, [[Liège]]) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]]/[[Belgian]] [[Prehistory|prehistorian]], pioneer in paleontology, and geologist. He is often considered the founder of [[paleontology]].

In 1829 he discovered [[Engis 2|the first]] [[Neanderthal man|Neanderthal]] fossil in a cave in [[Engis]], the partial [[cranium]] of a small child, although it was not recognized as such until 1936, and is now thought to be between 30,000-70,000 years old. It was the second discovery of a fossil of the genus [[Homo]] after the discovery of the [[Red Lady of Paviland]] in Wales in 1823.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Homo neanderthalensis |url=http://anthropology.si.edu/humanorigins/ha/neand.htm |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Philipus Carel, later Philippe-Charles, Schmerling was the son of Dutch parents, Jan Carel, a trader from 's-Hertogenbosch, North Brabant, and Lucia van Koijck from Dordrecht. Schmerling studied medicine in [[Delft]] and [[Leiden]]. Afterwards he served as physician in the Dutch army between 1812 and 1816.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.swing.be/sw201655/paged1.htm Biographie]&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 October 1821 in [[Venlo]] he married Elizabeth Douglas. They had two daughters, in 1823 and 1825.

In 1822, Schmerling and his wive moved to [[Liège]] at which [[University of Liège|university]] he continued his studies&lt;ref name = "Henderickx"&gt;Liliane Henderickx, « Philippe Charles Schmerling (1790-1836) révèle l'antiquité de l'homme grâce aux dépôts antédiluviens des grottes liégeoises », ''Revue d'Archéologie et de Paléontologie '', n° 10, Centre d'archéologie et de paléontologie, Plainevaux, 1991, p. 24-66.&lt;/ref&gt; and became Doctor of Medicine in 1825.

In 1829 he excavated fossils in what are now named the [[Schmerling Caves]], in the region of [[Flémalle]], in the [[Meuse]] valley, between [[Liège]] and [[Huy]].&lt;ref name = "Schmerling"&gt;Philippe Charles Schmerling, ''Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles découverts dans les cavernes de la province de Liège'', vol.

He became correspondent of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|Royal Institute]] of the Netherlands in September 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00002832 |title=P.C.

'''Reborrowing''' is the process where a word travels from one language to another and then back to the originating language in a different form or with a different meaning. This path is indicated by A→B→A, where A is the originating language, and can take many forms. A reborrowed word is sometimes called a '''''Rückwanderer''''' (German, a 'returner').

The result is generally a [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublet]], where the reborrowed word exists alongside the original word, though in other cases the original word may have died out. Alternatively, a specific sense of a borrowed word can be reborrowed as a [[semantic loan]]; for example, English ''pioneer'' was borrowed from [[Middle French]] in the sense of "digger, foot soldier, pedestrian", then acquired the sense of "early colonist, innovator" in English, which was reborrowed into French.&lt;ref name="oxford_durkin"&gt;''The Oxford Guide to Etymology,'' by Philip Durkin, 5. Lexical borrowing, 5.1 Basic concepts and terminology, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UZkjLniuwRQC&amp;pg=PP212 pp. 212–215]&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases the term may be [[calque]]d (loan translated) at some stage, such as English ''ready-to-wear'' → French ''prêt-à-porter'' (1951) → English ''prêt-à-porter'' (1957).&lt;ref name="oxford_durkin"/&gt;

In some cases the borrowing process can be more complicated and the words might move through different languages before coming back to the originating language. The single move from one language to the other is called "loan" (see [[loanword]]). Reborrowing is the result of more than one loan, when the final recipient language is the same as the originating one.

==Reborrowed morphemes==
A similar process occurs when a word is coined in a language based on roots from another language, and then the compound is borrowed into this other language or a modern descendant. In [[Western world|the West]] this primarily occurs with [[classical compound]]s, formed on Latin or [[Ancient Greek]] roots, which may then be borrowed into a Romance language or Modern Greek. Latin is sufficiently widespread that Latinate terms coined in a non-Romance language (such as English or German) and then borrowed by a Romance language (such as French or Spanish) are not conspicuous, but modern coinages on Ancient Greek roots borrowed into Modern Greek are, and include terms such as τηλεγράφημα ''telegrafíma'' ('telegram').&lt;ref name="McAuley"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Some Returned Loans: Japanese Loanwords in Taiwan Mandarin|first=Karen Steffen|last=Chung|title=Language change in East Asia|editor1-first=T. E|editor1-last=McAuley|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2001|pages=161–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process is particularly conspicuous in Chinese and Japanese, where in the late 19th and early 20th century many terms were coined in Japanese on Chinese roots (historically terms had often passed via Korea), known as {{Nihongo||和製漢語|[[wasei kango]]|Japanese-made Chinese-words}}, then borrowed into modern Chinese (and often Korean) with corresponding pronunciation; from the mid 20th century such borrowings are much rarer. Often these words could have been coined in Chinese, but happened to be coined first in Japanese; notable examples include
{{Nihongo2|文化}} ''bunka'' ('culture') and {{Nihongo2|革命}} ''kakumei'' ('revolution').&lt;ref name="McAuley"/&gt;

A '''ribbon''' is an award made from [[ribbon]] and presented to mark an achievement. Such ribbons usually have a pin, brooch or bridle clip as a fastener with which the award can be attached to clothing, animals, walls, or other surfaces.[[File:White wedding rosette 3Tiers.jpg|thumb|Wedding Rosettes mark the special event for the bride and groom or the guests of the bride and groom]]
[[File:Daffodil rosette.jpg|thumb|Daffodil Flower Rosettes suitable for many occasions as a gift or an award]]

Award ribbons can be simply a flat piece of ribbon, a flat-folded ribbon, or fancier manipulations of the ribbon material, such as rosettes. A rosette consists of ribbon that is [[pleat]]ed or [[Gather (sewing)|gathered]] and arranged in a circle so that it resembles a [[rose]], usually with streamer ribbons attached. Some ribbon rosettes will also have loops, petals and star points as part of the design whilst using Satin ribbons, Velvet ribbons, Sheer ribbons, Lamé ribbons, Tartan ribbons and printed ribbons including personalised printed ribbons to promote the sponsor, event or the reason for giving.

Ribbons are usually imprinted with information about the award, such as the name of the event, the sponsoring organization, the placement (such as first place, second place, etc.), and the date. More sophisticated awards also include the name of the recipient, special motifs and logos.

Ribbon rosette awards come in many sizes from 1 Tier (1 layer) up to super sized rosettes of (as standard) 20 Tiers. They can be glued together or sewn, however the centre disks always need to be stuck on with glue.

A ribbon rosette is made up with card backing disks to attach the pleated ribbon onto thus make the tiers of the rosette. Star points, petals and loops can be added, then chosen fastener, then tails and then the centre disk.

Rosettes can be used for awards for shows and events for all types: businesses, sports, hobbies and animals:- horses, dogs, cats, cattle, birds and ferrets, horticulture, business achievements, education as well as all disciplines of sports.

Celebration Rosettes are given to mark Birthdays, Valentine's Day, Christmas, Easter, Halloween or other special occasions like Weddings, Christenings and even Funerals. They can also come with a ribbon attachment allowing the rosettes to be hung up to display both sides, as some rosettes are produced back to back, creating two sides.

Rosettes are also produced in different shapes other than a circle, like ovals, squares, diamonds, rectangles and hearts.

Ribbon awards also come in different varieties like, medals, sashes and banners all of which can be personalised at many bespoke and wholesale companies from around the world.

Flower rosettes seem to be new to the market since 2012, where particular flowers are stylised into a rosette. Flower rosettes so far include Daffodil Rosettes, Carnation Rosettes and Rose Rosettes all of which can be used as a gift or an award, as a single Flower Rosette or as a bunch of Flower Rosettes depending on the occasion as its use.

'''''Ripper Street''''' is a British TV series set in [[Whitechapel]] in the [[East End of London]] and starring [[Matthew Macfadyen]], [[Jerome Flynn]], and [[Adam Rothenberg]].

==Plot==

===Series 1===
The series begins in April 1889, six months since the last [[Jack the Ripper]] killing, and in [[Whitechapel]] the H Division is responsible for policing one and a quarter square miles of [[East End of London|East London]]: a district with a population of 67,000 poor and dispossessed. The men of H Division had hunted the Ripper and failed to find him. When more women are murdered on the streets of Whitechapel, the police begin to wonder if the killer has returned.

Among the factories, [[rookery (slum)|rookeries]], chop shops (food establishments), [[brothel]]s and [[pub]]s, Detective Inspector [[Edmund Reid]] ([[Matthew Macfadyen]]) and Detective Sergeant Bennet Drake ([[Jerome Flynn]]) team up with former US Army surgeon and [[Pinkerton Government Services|Pinkerton]] agent Captain Homer Jackson ([[Adam Rothenberg]]) to investigate the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/ripperstreet/ |title=Ripper Street – New drama for BBC One starring Matthew Macfadyen, Jerome Flynn and Adam Rothenberg |publisher=BBC |date=28 November 2012 |accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They frequently cross paths with Tenter Street brothel madam Long Susan ([[MyAnna Buring]]), who came to London with Jackson from America and lets him reside at the brothel. Their relationship becomes strained due to Jackson's attraction to one of her most profitable girls, Rose Erskine ([[Charlene McKenna]]), and because of his close involvement with Reid and H Division.

Reid and his wife Emily ([[Amanda Hale]]) only have one daughter, Mathilda, who was lost and presumed deceased, some months before the series begins, in a river accident during the hunt for the Ripper. The newspaper reporter, Fred Best ([[David Dawson (actor)|David Dawson]]), knows a dark secret about her death. Although still troubled, and despite her husband's reservations, Emily is determined to make a new life for herself by helping the fallen women of Whitechapel.

===Series 2===
The second series is set in 1890. Emily has left Reid after he gave her false hope that Mathilda might not have drowned. Rose Erskine has left Long Susan's brothel to work as a waitress at the music hall, Blewett's Theatre of Varieties. Sergeant Drake has married another of Susan's girls, Bella. A new detective constable, Albert Flight ([[Damien Molony]]), is introduced.

Reid crosses swords with the ruthless Inspector Jedediah Shine ([[Joseph Mawle]]). Ten years an Inspector on the Hong Kong police force, Shine has used that experience to exert a firm grip over Limehouse’s neighbouring "K" Division and the emergent Chinatown that grows within it. Long Susan, happy as brothel keeper, is in debt to Silas Duggan ([[Frank Harper]]), who lent her funds to start the business, unbeknownst to Jackson who wants to leave London.

Historical backdrops to episodes in series 2 include [[History of Chinese immigration to the United Kingdom#1800s to World War II|Chinese immigration]], the [[London matchgirls strike of 1888]], electrical [[War of Currents]], the [[Cleveland Street scandal]], the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], [[Joseph Merrick]] (known as "the Elephant Man"), and the [[Baring crisis]].

===Series 3===
In 1894, a train accident in [[Whitechapel]] kills fifty-five civilians. At the scene of the accident, [[Edmund Reid|Reid]], Drake, Jackson, Rose Erskine and Long Susan are reunited after a long period of separation. Reid investigates the derailment and discovers that it was caused by a heist. The organiser is Susan's [[Solicitor advocate|solicitor]], Ronald Capshaw. His intention is to steal [[Bearer bonds|US bearer bonds]] in order to bail out their financially stricken Obsidian Estates and to continue in their attempt to gentrify Whitechapel.

Mathilda is discovered by Capshaw to be still alive, although Reid is told by Susan that she has died since being rescued. Mathilda escapes and is picked up by Harry Ward, a teenage pimp. Receiving a tip-off where she was last seen, Reid and Bennett find her, but she runs away. Reid returns to his home and father and daughter reunite.

===Series 4===
Series 4 opens in 1897, the year of [[Queen Victoria]]'s diamond jubilee. Reid has now given up his detective work and is living in [[Hampton-on-Sea]] with Matilda. He is drawn back to [[Whitechapel]] after a visit from Deborah Goren, who urges him to return to investigate the murder of a rabbi at the hand of Isaac Bloom, whom she believes innocent.

Meanwhile, Drake is now head inspector of [[Whitechapel]] and still employs Jackson, who has given up his drinking and gambling in order to save money to free Susan, who is now sentenced to hang for her crimes. When his attempts to legally free her fail, he helps to fake her death, forcing her to give up their son to be raised by Drake and his wife Rose, while Susan hides out of sight and Jackson pretends to be a grieving widower to his friends.

===Series 5===
Series 5 continues the events of the tragic ending of series 4.

==Production==
A joint [[BBC]] and [[BBC America]] production written by Richard Warlow, Julie Rutterford, Declan Croghan and Toby Finlay and directed by [[Andy Wilson (director)|Andy Wilson]] (4 episodes), Colm McCarthy (2 episodes) and [[Tom Shankland]] (2 episodes). The series includes scenes of the seedier side of life during the late [[Victorian era]], including [[bare-knuckle boxing]], early pornography and prostitution.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |first= Catherine|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9565354/Ripper-Street-gruesome-new-crime-drama-set-in-the-east-end-of-London.html |title=Ripper Street: gruesome new crime drama set in the east end of London |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=25 September 2012 |accessdate= |last=Gee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Shankland said of the series, "[[Whitechapel]]'s not an area that was short of vicious murders and any woman found murdered with a knife in the consequent months was held up as a [[Jack the Ripper|Ripper]] murder... So we’ll touch on Ripper in that way but not dig anybody up or change the [[Jack the Ripper#Canonical five|canonical five]]... All the period depictions I’d seen of that particular crime story had almost been a bit too well behaved in a slightly slower way and shots have to be a bit wider to show off the nice furniture, but if you can think of something awful, it was happening [in [[Victorian London]]]."&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

===Casting===
The three leads of the show, [[Matthew Macfadyen|Macfadyen]], [[Jerome Flynn|Flynn]] and [[Adam Rothenberg|Rothenberg]], have discussed how they got the roles in interviews. Macfadyen claims his involvement was all down to his interest in the 'fresh' script: "I had a few months of nothing, then a load of scripts all came at once, and this was by far the best. It's such terrific writing; it just barrelled along. I saw the title and thought, 'This has been done before', but it was so fresh, and it had all the qualities, interest and depth of a period drama."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/macfadyen-couldnt-resist-ripper-st-16263503.html |title=MacFadyen couldn't resist Ripper St |publisher=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk |date=19 January 2013|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothenberg's involvement in the show was more straightforward, as he auditioned during pilot series. In an interview with both Flynn and Rothenberg, the latter states: "I auditioned for it, got it, and then showed up. That’s as simple as it was for me." to which Flynn chimes in, claiming: "it was very funny, though, ‘cause when he [Rothenberg] did show up, he was like, “I don’t know how the f*** I got here!". Flynn's casting experience was similar: "It was pretty basic for me. The writer, Richard Warlow, had seen me in ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', playing Bronn, and asked about casting me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/ripper-street-jerome-flynn-adam-rothenberg-interview/#more-225620 |title=Jerome Flynn and Adam Rothenberg Talk BBC America's New Crime Drama Ripper Street|publisher=Collider |date=24 January 2013|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Ripper Street'' was well received by critics upon release. On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]], the first season of the series holds a score of 72 out of 100, indicating "generally favorable reviews". On another [[review aggregator]] website, [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the first season features a score of 100 percent, based on 17 reviews.

Critical reception of the initial two episodes was divided with some praising the show's gritty script and good acting performances, and others feeling the show was a mix of ITV's ''[[Whitechapel (TV series)|Whitechapel]]'' and [[Guy Ritchie]]'s ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]''.&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt;

In his weekly review of the show, Jamie-Lee Nardone wrote of its continued improvements, "more of this please, just perhaps not before dinner", referencing the show's gory nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/ripper-street/24067/ripper-street-episode-3-review-the-king-came-calling |title=Ripper Street episode 3 review: The King Came Calling |website=Den of Geek |date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam Wollaston of ''[[The Guardian]]'' discussed the pros and cons of the show, claiming "It would be easy to be negative about Ripper Street. Do we really need more on a story that's been not just done to death, but then carved up, and had its insides torn out?" but he concludes his review stating "[ the] script is real, alive and human. It's beautifully performed, and beautiful to look at&amp;nbsp;– stylish, and stylised. The bare-knuckle fight scenes are brutal and memorable. It's proper, character-based crime drama, gripping, and yes&amp;nbsp;– I'm afraid&amp;nbsp;– ripping as well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sam |last=Wollaston |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/dec/30/ripper-street-tv-review |title=TV review: Ripper Street; Neil Armstrong – First Man on the Moon; The Hotel &amp;#124; Television &amp; radio |work=The Guardian |date= 30 December 2012|accessdate=18 October 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benji Wilson of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reviewed the first episode positively, praising the performances of the three leads, which he said compensated for the "dull grind of all the exposition" and "tedious" historical references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9769580/Ripper-Street-BBC-One-review.html |title=Ripper Street, BBC One, review |work=The Telegraph |date= 30 December 2012|accessdate=18 October 2013 |location=London |first=Benji |last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[PopMatters]]'' reviewed the debut episode, remarking: &lt;blockquote&gt; The effects of such moments are shaped by writer/creator Richard Warlow and episode director Tom Shankland’s attention to the period details: streets are sooty, gaslight creates flickering shadows, and stone floors make footsteps seem chilling. These details help make Ripper Street a compelling procedural, its long form narrative and deliberate pace different from the CSI and Law &amp; Order clones. But the show also bears traces of contemporary influences: an underground boxing club sequence in the first episode resembles similar scenes in Sherlock Holmes (2009) so much that a coincidence is hard to imagine. Equally derivative, some overt efforts to shock viewers deliver graphic violence and some nudity, courtesy of the evolving technology of photography, as it’s inspiring an evolving “smut” industry.&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web|website=[[PopMatters]]|title='Ripper Street': The Famous Killer Inspires Anew|last=Maçek III |first=J.C.|date=19 January 2013|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/167386-ripper-street-the-famous-killer-inspires-anew/|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ahead of its debut in the US, [[IGN]]'s Roth Cornet reviewed the first episode, discussing how "the setting is handled with absolute care and a razor-sharp attention to detail, from costume and production design to the varied vocal cadences of the players, the texture and flavor of London's East End are brought to vivid life." The review continues to discuss the show's depiction of London's streets in the Victorian era: &lt;blockquote&gt; Ripper Street provides a gritty look at the evolving streets of London and the advent of technology at the time; be it the "moving-picture-machine" that is featured in "I Need Light" or the introduction of early forensics that follows through the series. More interesting still is that it is the dirt and bones look at the uses of said technology that is in play here. This is no wink-wink "look at how charming early cameras were" depiction, but rather a portrayal of the underbelly of what those cameras would have been used for. Additionally, there is engaging interplay between those who would usher in necessary change and those who are, as Jackson says, "the barriers to progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/01/20/ripper-street-i-need-light-review?abthid=50fb4162ba1f8a9968000029 |title=Ripper Street: "I Need Light" Review – IGN |website=Uk.ign.com |date=19 January 2013 |accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave it significant praise: "Ripper Street is a well-acted, well-written and compelling mystery series. And even better, there’s no waiting around, wishing it would improve. It’s alluring from the start."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodman |first=Tim |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/bbc-americas-ripper-street-tv-412614 |title=BBC America's Ripper Street: TV Review |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=17 January 2013 |accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "Well-written and acted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNamara |first=Mary |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-ripper-street-review-bbc-20130119,0,2536062.story |title=Review: BBC America's 'Ripper Street' a fine dose of mystery |work=Los Angeles Times |date=19 January 2013 |accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some female critics have not been so positive about the show, disappointed by its two-dimensional portrayal of women as either repressed wives and mothers or prostitutes.

[[Jan Moir]] of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' wrote that "the torture and murder of women" is "enthusiastically depicted", claiming "there is terrible violence meted out to men and children, too, but the focus of the viciousness is always on the knicker-dropping molls and the ‘tarts’".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2258723/Ripper-Street-Who-decided-make-BBCs-Sunday-night-period-drama-anti-women-orgy-gore.html |title=Who decided to make the BBC's Sunday night period drama an anti-women orgy of gore? |work=Daily Mail |date=7 January 2013 |accessdate=3 July 2013 |location=London |first=Jan |last=Moir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grace Dent of ''[[The Independent]]'' was more satirical about the show, but was still unamused by the portrayal of women, stating "centuries may shift and fashions may change, yet raping and murdering women has really never been as popular."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Grace |last=Dent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/grace-dent-on-tv-ripper-street-bbc1-8437063.html |title=Grace Dent on TV: Ripper Street, BBC1 – Reviews – TV &amp; Radio |work=The Independent |date=5 January 2013 |accessdate=18 October 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roman historiography''' is indebted to the [[Greek historiography|Greeks]], who invented the form. The Romans had great models to base their works upon, such as [[Herodotus]] (c. 484 – 425 [[Before Christ|BC]]) and [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 – c. 395 BC). [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historiographical forms are different from the Greek ones however, and voice very Roman concerns. Unlike the Greeks, Roman [[historiography]] did not start out with an oral historical tradition.  The Roman style of history was based on the way that the [[Annals]] of the [[Pontifex Maximus]], or the [[Annales Maximi]], were recorded. The Annales Maximi include a wide array of information, including religious documents, names of consuls, deaths of priests, and various disasters throughout history.  Also part of the Annales Maximi are the White Tablets, or the "Tabulae Albatae", which consist of information on the origin of the republic.

==History==

===Foundation===

The most well-known originator of Roman historiography was [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]], also known as the "Founder of Historiography".  Before the [[second Punic war]], there was no historiography in Rome, but after, it was needed to commemorate this important occasion. Q. Fabius Pictor took up the task and wrote a history of Rome in Greek, not Latin. This choice of writing about the war in Greek arose from a need to address the Greeks and counter another author, [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]], who also wrote a history of Rome until the Second Punic War.  Timaeus wrote with a negative view of Rome.  Therefore, in defense of the Roman state, Q. Fabius Pictor wrote in Greek, using [[Calendar era#Olympiad dating|Olympiad dating]] and a Hellenistic style.  Q. Fabius Pictor's style of writing history defending the Roman state and its actions, and using propaganda heavily, eventually became a defining characteristic of Roman historiography.

Q. Fabius Pictor is known for the establishment of the "ab urbe condita" tradition of historiography which is writing history "from the founding of the city". After Q. Fabius Pictor wrote, many other authors followed his lead, inspired by the new literary form: [[Lucius Cincius Alimentus]], [[Gaius Acilius]], [[Aulus Postumius Albinus (consul 151 BC)|Aulus Postumius Albinus]], and [[Cato the Elder]]. Cato the Elder is credited as the first historian to write in Latin. His work, the ''Origines'', was written to teach Romans what it means to be Roman. Like Q. Fabius Pictor, Cato the Elder wrote ab urbe condita, and the early history is filled with legends illustrating Roman virtues. The ''Origines'' also spoke of how not only Rome, but the other Italian towns were venerable, and that the Romans were indeed superior to the Greeks.

The Romans enjoyed serious endeavors and so the writing of historiography became very popular for upper class citizens who wanted to spend their time on worthwhile, virtuous, "Roman" activities. As leisure time was looked down upon by the Romans, writing history became an acceptable way to spend retirement.

Almost as soon as historiography started being used by the Romans, it split into two traditions: the annalistic tradition and the monographic tradition.

===The annalistic tradition===

The authors who used the Annalistic tradition wrote histories year-by-year, from the beginning, which was most frequently from the founding of the city, usually up until the time that they were living in.

Some annalistic authors:
*[[Gnaeus Gellius]] (c. 140 BC) wrote his history from [[Aeneas]] until 146 BC.
*[[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi (consul 133 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi]] (c. 133 BC) wrote trying to figure out why the Roman society had begun to decline. His history chronicled Rome from the foundation until 154 BC, when he believed that the society had hit its lowest point.
*[[Publius Mucius Scaevola]] (c. 133 BC) wrote a history from the foundation of the city in 80 books.
*[[Sempronius Asellio]] (c. 100 BC) wrote a history from the [[Punic Wars]] until c. 100 BC.
*[[Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius]] wrote that all Roman wars are just, and that the Senate and all Roman dealings were honorable, in annalistic form.

===The monographic tradition===

Monographs are more similar to the history books that we are used to today; they are usually on a single topic, but most importantly, they do not tell history from the beginning, and they are not even necessarily annalistic. An important sub category that emerged from the monographic tradition was the biography.

Some monographic authors:
*[[Gaius Gracchus]] wrote a biography of his brother, [[Tiberius Gracchus]].
*Gaius Fannius also wrote a biography of Tiberius Gracchus, but showed him in a negative light.
*[[Lucius Coelius Antipater]] wrote a monograph on the Second Punic War.
*[[Sallust]] wrote two monographs: ''Bellum Catilinae'' (also known as ''De Catilinae Coniuratione''), which is about the Catilinarian conspiracy from 66–63 BC, and the ''Bellum Jugurthinum,'' which is about the war with [[Jugurtha]] which took place from 111–105 BC.

===Factionalized history===

Often, especially in times of political unrest or social turmoil, historians re-wrote history to suit their particular views of the age. So, there were many different historians each rewriting history a little bit to bolster their case. This was especially evident in the 70s BC when the social wars were going on between the populists led by [[Gaius Marius|Marius]], and the senatorials led by [[Sulla]]. Several authors wrote histories during this time, each taking a side. [[Gaius Licinius Macer]] was anti-Sullan and wrote his history, based on Gnaeus Gellius in 16 books, from the founding of the city until the 3rd century BC, whereas Valerius Antias who was pro-Sulla, wrote a history in 75 books, from the founding of the city until 91 BC.

===Overview===

The historiography we most readily identify with the Romans, coming from sources such as [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Sallust]], [[Livy]], [[Tacitus]], and other minor authors, owes much to its early roots and Greek predecessors.  However, contrary to the Greek form, the Roman form included various attitudes and concerns that were considered strictly Roman. As the recording of Roman history began to evolve and take shape, many characteristics came to define what we know today as Roman historiography, most notably the strong defense of and allegiance to the Roman state and its wide variety of moral ideals, the factional nature of some histories, the splitting of historiography into two distinct categories, the Annals and the Monograph, and the rewriting of history to suit the author's needs.

==Characteristics==

[[Annals]] are a year-by-year arrangement of historical writing.  In Roman historiography, annals generally begin at the founding of Rome.  Proper annals include whatever events were of importance for each year, as well as other information such as the names of that year's consuls, which was the basis by which Romans generally identified years.  The Annal seems originally to have been used by the priesthood to keep track of omens and portents.

The ''Annales Maximi'' were a running set of annals kept by the Pontifex Maximus.  The ''Annales Maximi'' contained such information as names of the magistrates of each year, public events, and omens such as eclipses and monstrous births.  The ''Annales Maximi'' covers the period from the early Roman Republic to around the time of the Gracchi.

Gracchan Annalist seems to refer to the writers of history in annalistic form who began writing after the time of the Gracchi.  Compared to other forms of annalistic history, these seem more fictionalized as Roman historians used their histories to illustrate points about their own time, and were not necessarily out to produce hard fact.  Still, Gracchan annalists have produced interesting insight into the writer's own time, if not necessarily into the time on which they wrote. Sallust and Tacitus are fair examples of Gracchan Annalists.

A monograph is a comprehensive work on a single subject.  The monograph could be written about a single event, a technique, rhetoric, or one of any number of other subjects.  For example, [[Pliny the Elder]] once published a monograph on the use of the throwing-spear by cavalry. Monographs were among the most common historical works found in Roman writings.

''Ab urbe condita'', literally "From the founding of the city", describes the Roman tradition of beginning histories at the founding of the city of Rome.  For examples, see Tacitus, Livy, Sallust, et al.  In Livy's ''Ab Urbe Condita'', much time is spent on the early history of Rome, and on the founding of the city itself.  In Sallust's histories, the founding and early history of Rome is almost reduced to a single sentence.  Thus, the ''ab urbe condita'' form is extremely variable while continuing to mold Roman histories.

"Senatorial History" describes history written by or with information from a [[Roman Senate|Roman Senator]].  Senatorial histories are generally particularly informative due to their "insider's" perspective.  A general pattern of Senatorial histories is that they seem to invariably contain a reason that the author is writing histories instead of remaining involved in politics.

Sullan annalists politicized their past. They were partisans of the Sullan faction who carried on the Marius and Sulla conflict through their histories, often rewriting them to fit their own agenda. Some Sullan annalists may have been sources for Livy. Valerius Antias (fl. 80-60 BC) was a Sullan annalist but he was not viewed as a credible historian. He seems to have been trying to counter the Marian historian, C. Licinius Macer. Antias' history, written in seventy-six books, is melodramatic and often filled with exaggerations and lies. In his history, anyone named Cornelius is considered a hero and anyone named Claudius is an enemy and the opposition to the [[populares]] never went by a consistent name but were instead called "boni", "optime" or "[[optimates]]", implying that they were the good guys.

Roman historiography is also very well known for subversive writing styles. The information in the ancient Roman histories is often communicated by suggestion, innuendo, implication and insinuation because their attitudes would not always be well received. Tacitus opposed the emperors and believed that they were one of the reasons for the decline of Rome. Tacitus even wrote disparagingly of [[Augustus]] the most celebrated and beloved of the emperors. Of course these opinions had to be veiled since they would not have gone over very well.

In Roman historiography [[commentarii]] is simply a raw account of events often not intended for publication. It was not considered traditional "history" because it lacked the necessary speeches and literary flourishes.   Commentarii was usually turned into "history" later on. Many think Caesar's account of the [[Gallic Wars]], ''Commentarii Rerum Gestarum'' (Commentaries on Things Done), was called commentarii for propagandistic purposes. They believe that it is actually "history" since it is so well written, pro-Roman and fits the traditional patterns of historiography.

Ancient Roman historians did not write for the sake of writing, they wrote in an effort to convince their audiences. [[Propaganda]] is ever present and is the function of Roman historiography. Ancient Roman historians traditionally had personal and political baggage and were not disinterested observers. Their accounts were written with the specific moral and political agendas. For example, Q. Fabius Pictor started the tradition of historiography that was concerned with both morality and history and affirmed the prestige of Roman state and its people.

Ancient Roman historians wrote pragmatic histories in order to benefit future statesmen. The philosophy of pragmatic history treats historical happenings with special reference to causes, conditions and results. In Roman Historiography the facts and an impression of what the facts mean are presented. Interpretation is always a part of historiography; Romans never made any pretense about it. Conflict between the facts and the interpretation of those facts indicate a good historian. [[Polybius]], who wrote in Greek, was the first pragmatic historian. His histories have an aristocratic ethos and reveal his opinions on honor, wealth and war. Tacitus was also a pragmatic. His histories have literary merit and interpretations of facts and events. He was not purely objective, rather his judgments served a moral function.

==Major extant historians==

===Caesar===

[[Julius Caesar]] was born on July 12, 100 BC into a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family. As a young man, he was given the position of the [[Flamen Dialis]] by his father-in-law, Cornelius Cinna. When that position was taken away by Sulla, Caesar spent a decade in Asia, earning a great reputation in the military. Upon his return to Rome, he was both elected [[tribune|tribunus militium]] and given the title of [[pontifex maximus|pontifex]]. During his time in these positions, Caesar befriended [[Pompey]] and [[Crassus]], the two men with whom he would later form the First Triumvirate. As the years went on, recognition for Caesar's political, military, and oratory skills grew and he easily earned the positions of [[praetor]] and consul. After his consulship, Caesar gained control of the provinces of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and [[Cisalpine Gaul|Cisalpine]] and [[Transalpine Gaul]]. In 58 BC, trouble arose in the Gallic provinces, sparking one of the most important wars of Caesar's career.

The ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' is Caesar's account of the Gallic Wars. As the Wars were raging on, Caesar fell victim to a great deal of criticisms from Rome. ''De Bello Gallico'' is a response to these criticisms, and a way for Caesar to justify these Wars. His argument is that the Wars were both just and pious, and that he and his army attacked Gaul in self-defense. The [[Helvetians]] were forming a massive migration straight through the provinces. When a group of neighboring allies came to Caesar himself asking for help against these invading Helvetians, that was all the justification Caesar needed to gather his army. By creating an account that portrays himself as a superb military hero, Caesar was able to clear all doubts in Rome about his abilities as a leader.

Although Caesar used this account for his own gain, it is not to say that the ''De Bello Gallico'' is at all unreliable. Many of the victories that Caesar has written about did, in fact, occur. Smaller details, however, may have been altered, and the word choice makes the reader more sympathetic to Caesar's cause. ''De Bello Gallico'' is an excellent example of the ways in which retellings of actual events can be spun to a person's advantage. For this reason, ''De Bello Gallico'' is often looked at as a commentary, rather than a piece of actual historiography.

===Livy===

Titus Livius, commonly known as [[Livy]], was a Roman historian best known for his work entitled ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', which is a history of Rome "from the founding of the city". He was born in [[Patavium]], which is modern day Padua, in 59 BC and he died there in 17 AD. Others referred to his writing as having "patavinitas". Little is known about his life, but based on an [[epitaph]] found in Padua, he had a wife and two sons. We also know that he was on good terms with Augustus and he also encouraged [[Claudius]] to write history.

''Ab Urbe Condita'' covered Roman history from its founding, commonly accepted as 753 BC, to 9 BC. It consisted of 142 books, though only books 1–10 and 21–45 survive in whole, although summaries of the other books and a few other fragments exist. The books were referred to as "decades" because Livy organized his material into groups of ten books. The decades were further split in pentads:
*Books 1–5 cover from the founding to 390 BC.
*Books 6–10 cover 390–293 BC.
*Though we do not have books 11–20, evidence suggests that books 11–15 discussed [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and books 16–20 dealt with the [[First Punic War]].
*Books 21–30 cover the [[Second Punic War]]:
**21–25 deal with [[Hannibal]].
**26–30 deal with [[Scipio Africanus]].
*The wars against [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] in Greece are discussed in books 31–35.
*The wars against [[Antiochus III]] in the east in books 36–40.
*The [[Third Macedonian War]] is dealt with in books 40–45.
*Books 45–121 are missing.
*Books 121–142 deal with the events from 42 through 9 BC.

The purpose of writing ''Ab Urbe Condita'' was twofold: the first was to memorialize history and the second was to challenge his generation to rise to that same level. He was preoccupied with morality, using history as a moral essay. He connects a nation's success with its high level of morality, and conversely a nation's failure with its moral decline. Livy believed that there had been a moral decline in Rome, and he lacked the confidence that Augustus could reverse it. Though he shared Augustus' ideals, he was not a "spokesman for the regime". He believed that Augustus was necessary, but only as a short term measure.

According to [[Quintillian]], Livy wrote ''lactea ubertas'', or "with milky richness". He used language to embellish his material, including the use of both poetical and archaic words. He included many anachronisms in his work, such as tribunes having power that they did not have until much later. Livy also used rhetorical elaborations, such as attributing speeches to characters whose speeches could not possibly be known. Though he was not thought of as a first-rate historian, his work was so extensive that other histories were abandoned for Livy. It is unfortunate that these other histories were abandoned, especially since much of Livy's work is now gone, leaving holes in our knowledge of Roman history.

===Sallust===

C. Sallustius Crispus, more commonly known as [[Sallust]], was a Roman historian of the 1st century BC, born c. 86 BC in the [[Sabine]] community of [[Amiternum]]. There is some evidence that Sallust's family belonged to a local aristocracy, but we do know that he did not belong to Rome's ruling class. Thus he embarked on a political career as a "[[novus homo]]", serving as a military tribune in the 60s BC, [[quaestor]] from 55 to 54 BC, and [[tribune of the plebs]] in 52 BC. Sallust was expelled from the senate in 50 BC on moral grounds, but quickly revived his career by attaching himself to Julius Caesar. He served as quaestor again in 48 BC, as [[praetor]] in 46 BC, and governed the new province in the former [[Numidian]] territory until 44 BC. Sallust's political career ended upon his return to Rome and Caesar's assassination in 44 BC.

We possess in full two of the historical works that have been convincingly ascribed to Sallust, the monographs, ''[[Catiline|Bellum Catilinae]]'' and ''[[Jugurthine War|Bellum Jugurthinum]]''. We have only fragments of the third work, the [[Histories (Tacitus)|''Historiae'']]. There is less agreement about the authorship of some other works that have, at times, been attributed to him. In ''Bellum Catilinae'', Sallust outlines the conspiracy of [[Catiline]], a brash and ambitious patrician who tried to seize power in Rome in 63 BC. In his other monograph, Sallust used the Jugurthine War as a backdrop for his examination of the development of party struggles in Rome in the 1st century BC. The ''Historiae'' describe in general the history of the years 78–67 BC.

Although Sallust's purposes in writing have been debated over the years, it seems logical to classify him as a senatorial historian who adopted the attitude of a [[Roman censor|censor]]. The historical details outlined in his monographs serve as paradigms for Sallust. In ''Bellum Catilinae'', Sallust uses the figure of Catiline as a symbol of the corrupt Roman nobility. Indeed, much of what Sallust writes in this work does not even concern Catiline. The content of ''Bellum Jugurthinum'' also suggests that Sallust was more interested in character studies (e.g. Marius) than the details of the war itself. With respect to writing style, the main influences on Sallust's work were [[Thucydides]] and [[Cato the Elder]]. Evidence of the former's influence includes emphasis on politics, use of archaisms, character analysis, and selective omission of details. The use of such devices as [[asyndeton]], [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]], and [[chiasmus]] reflect preference for the old-fashioned Latin style of Cato to the [[Cicero]]nian periodic structure of his own era.

Whether Sallust is considered a reliable source or not, he is largely responsible for our current image of Rome in the late republic. He doubtlessly incorporates elements of exaggeration in his works and has at times been described as more of an artist or politician than historian. But our understanding of the moral and ethical realities of Rome in the 1st century BC would be much weaker if Sallust's works did not survive.

===Tacitus===

[[Tacitus]] was born c. 56 AD in, most likely, either Cisalpine or Narbonese Gaul.  Upon arriving in Rome, which would have happened by 75, he quickly began to lay down the tracks for his political career.  By 88, he was made praetor under [[Domitian]], and he was also a member of the ''quindecimviri sacris faciundis''.  From 89 to 93, Tacitus was away from Rome with his newly married wife, the daughter of the general [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]].  97 saw Tacitus being named the consul suffectus under [[Nerva]].  It is likely that Tacitus held a proconsulship in Asia.  His death is datable to c. 118.

There is much scholarly debate concerning the order of publication of Tacitus' works; traditional dates are given here.
*98 – ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola (De vita Iulii Agricolae)]]''.  This was a laudation of the author's father-in-law, the aforementioned general Cn. Iulius Agricola.  More than a biography, however, can be garnered from the ''Agricola'': Tacitus includes sharp words and poignant phrases aimed at the emperor Domitian.
*98 – ''[[Germania (book)|Germania (De origine et situ Germanorum)]]''.  "belongs to a literary genre, describing the country, peoples and customs of a race" (Cooley 2007).
*c. 101/102– ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus|Dialogus (Dialogus de oratoribus)]]''.  This is a commentary on the state of [[Eloquence|oratory]] as Tacitus sees it.
*c. 109 – ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]''.  This work spanned the end of the reign of [[Nero]] to the death of Domitian.  Unfortunately, the only extant books of this 12–14 volume work are 1–4 and a quarter of book 5.
*Unknown – ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annales (Ab excessu divi Augusti)]]''.  This is Tacitus' largest and final work.  Some scholars also regard this as his most impressive work.  The date of publication and whether it was completed at all are unknown.  The ''Annales'' covered the reigns of [[Tiberius]], [[Caligula]], Claudius, and Nero.  Like the Histories, parts of the ''Annales'' are lost: most of book 5, books 7–10, part of book 11, and everything after the middle of 16.  Tacitus' familiar invective is also present in this work.

Tacitus' style is very much like that of Sallust.  Short, sharp phrases cut right to the point, and Tacitus makes no bones about conveying his point.  His claim that he writes history "sine ira et studio" ("without anger and partiality") (''Annales'' I.1) is not exactly one that is true.  Many of his passages ooze with hatred towards the emperors. Despite this seemingly obvious partisan style of writing, much of what is said can go under the radar, which is as Tacitus wanted things to be.  His skill as an orator, which was praised by his good friend Pliny, no doubt contributes to his supreme mastery of the Latin language. Not one to mince words, Tacitus does not waste time with a history of Rome ''ab urbe condita''.  Rather, he gives a brief synopsis of the key points before he begins a lengthier summary of the reign of Augustus.  From there, he launches into his scathing account of history from where Livy would have left off.

===Suetonius===

Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus ([[Suetonius]]) is most famous for his biographies of the [[Julio-Claudian]] and [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] emperors and other notable historical figures.  He was born around 69 to an [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/571641/Suetonius "Suetonius".] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2013. Retrieved 24 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Living during the times of the Emperor [[Trajan]] and having a connection to [[Pliny the Younger]], Suetonius was able to begin a rise in rank in the imperial administration.  In c. 102, he was appointed to a military tribune position in Britain, which he did not actually accept.  He was, though, among the staff for Pliny's command in [[Bithynia]].  During the late period of Trajan's rule and under [[Hadrian]], he held various positions, until he was discharged.  He had a close proximity to the government as well as access to the imperial archives, which can be seen in his historical biographies.

Suetonius wrote a large number of biographies on important literary figures of the past (''De Viris Illustribus'').  Included in the collection were notable poets, grammarians, orators, historians, and philosophers.  This collection, like his other works, was not organized chronologically.  Not all of it has survived to the present day, but there are a number of references in other sources to attribute fragments to this collection.

His most famous work, though, is the ''[[De Vita Caesarum]]''.  This collection of twelve biographies tells the lives of the Julio-Claudian and Flavian Emperors, spanning from Julius Caesar to Domitian.  Other than an introduction genealogy and a short summary of the subject's youth and death, the biographies do not follow a chronological pattern.  Rather than chronicling events as they happened in time, Suetonius presents them thematically.  This style allowed him to compare the achievements and downfalls of each emperor using various examples of imperial responsibilities, such as building projects and public entertainment.  However, it makes dating aspects of each emperor's life and the events of the early [[Roman Empire]] difficult.  It also completely removes the ability to extrapolate a causal sequence from the works.  Suetonius's purpose was not a historical recount of events, though, but rather an evaluation of the emperors themselves.

Suetonius's style is simple; he often quotes directly from sources that were used, and artistic organization and language does not seem to exist.  He addresses points directly, without flowery or misleading language, and quotes from his sources often.  However, he is often criticized that he was more interested in the interesting stories about the emperors and not about the actual occurrences of their reigns.  The style, with which he writes, primarily stems from his overarching purpose, to catalogue the lives of his subjects.  He was not writing an annalistic history, nor was he even trying to create a narrative.  His goal was the evaluation of the emperors, portraying the events and actions of the person while they were in office.  He focuses on the fulfillment of duties, criticizing those that did not live up to expectations, and praising bad emperors for times when they did fulfill their duties.

There are a variety of other lost or incomplete works by Suetonius, many of which describe areas of culture and society, like the Roman Year or the names of seas.  However, what we know about these is only through references outside the works themselves.

==Other notable historians==

*[[Polybius]] (c. 208–116 BC) was a prominent Greek who figured strongly in the [[Achaean League]].  Upon being captured by the Romans and transported to Rome, Polybius took it upon himself to record the history of Rome in order to explain Roman tradition to his fellow Greeks.  He wanted to convince them to accept the domination of Rome as a universal truth.  His main work, ''Histories'', is extant despite its being fragmented.
*[[Diodorus Siculus]] was a Greek historian of the 1st century BC. His main body of work was the ''Bibliotheca'', which consisted of forty books and was intended to be a universal history from mythological times to the 1st century BC. He employed a very simple and straightforward style of writing, and relied heavily on written accounts for his information, most of which are now lost. Often criticized for a lack of originality and deemed a "scissors and paste" historian, Diodorus endeavored to present a comprehensive human history in a convenient and readable form.
*[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (fl. c. 8 BC.) was a Greek historian and critic living in Rome. His major work was ''Roman Antiquities'', a history of Rome from its mythical beginnings until the first Punic war, consisting of 20 books. Generally he is considered to be a less reliable source than most of the other historians, but he does fill in the gaps in Livy's accounts. Other works include: ''On Imitation'', ''On Dinarchus'', ''On Thucidides'', and ''On the Arrangement of Words''.
*[[Pliny the Elder]], uncle of [[Pliny the Younger]], wrote in the 1st century AD.  He was an officer in the Roman military who died in the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in 79 AD. His known works include ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'', which is a collection of books on natural history, ''Bella Germanica'', a 21 book history of the German wars which occurred during his lifetime, and a 31 book history of Julio-Claudian Rome.
*Titus Flavius [[Josephus]] (born 39 AD) was a Jewish historian and [[apologist]]. His works include ''[[The Jewish War]]'' (75 to 79), ''Jewish Antiquities'' (93), ''The Life'' (95) and ''[[Against Apion]]'' (Publication date unknown). He was influenced by Thucydides and Polybius and was endorsed by the Emperor [[Titus]]. Though many critics thought that he was a traitor to his people, his writings show that he was a zealous defender of the Jewish faith and culture.
*[[Appian]]us of Alexandria (c. 95–165) wrote in Greek his ''Romaiken istorian'' [''Roman History''], about half of which survives. This work is best known for its coverage of the Civil Wars of the late Republic (in his Books XIII to XVII). Appian addresses here the period roughly from 133 to 35 BC, i.e., from the reforms of [[Tiberius Gracchus]] to the death of [[Sextus Pompey]].
*[[Dio Cassius]] was a distinguished Greek senator.  After establishing his political career, Dio Cassius began to write various literary works.  His most famous and recognized work is called the ''Roman History'', which consists of 80 books.  This work is dominated by the change from a Roman republic to a monarchy of emperors, which Dio Cassius believed was the only way Rome could have a stable government.  Today, the only surviving portion of the ''Roman History'' is the part from 69 BC to 46 AD.
*In his 31 book history, sometimes translated as ''The Roman History'' or ''The Roman Empire'', [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] described the time from the reign of [[Nerva]] to the [[Battle of Adrianople]], though the first thirteen books are lost.  Bringing into the remaining books his own personal experiences in military services, his writing had a unique descriptive quality, of the geography, the events, and even the character of the actors.  There is an active debate about whether the intent of the history was a continuation of Tacitus.
*The ''[[Scriptores Historiae Augustae]]'' is a compilation of biographies of the Roman emperors from 117 to 284. Though claimed to be written by several different authors, contemporary research has shown that it may have only been written by one writer. This one author may have had good reason to disguise his identity, since much of the information in the ''Scriptores'' has also been found to be very unreliable.
*In [[Late Antiquity]], a great quantity of ''breviaria'', or short historical works, were published (see [[Aurelius Victor]], [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], [[Festus (historian)|Festus]], [[Epitome de Caesaribus]]). They had a common source, the so-called ''[[Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte]]'' (''Enmann's History of the Emperors''), which is lost.
*[[Zosimus]] was a pagan historian who wrote at c. 500 AD a history of Rome to 410 in six books. Although he couldn't be compared with Ammianus Marcellinus, his work is important for the events after 378.
* The important histories of [[Priscus]] and [[Olympiodorus of Thebes]] are lost except for some fragments.
*[[Velleius Paterculus]] was a Roman historian who lived from around 19 BC to after 30 AD. He wrote ''Historiae Romanae'', which is a summary of Roman history from the founding of the city to 30 AD. Though almost all of his work is now missing, it is still a valuable source on the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius. He "represents the adulatory type of history condemned by Tacitus, who ignores Velleius, as do all ancient authorities".

'''Rıza Nur''' (August 30, 1879 in [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]]–September 8, 1942 in [[Istanbul]]) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] surgeon, politician and writer. He was prominent in the years immediately after the [[First World War]], where he served as a cabinet minister but was subsequently marginalised, and became a critic of the new regime.

==Early years==
[[File:Rıza Nur.jpg|thumb|150px|Rıza Nur in the 1920s]]
After graduating from the Military Medical School in 1901 Rıza Nur went on to work as a [[surgeon]] at Gülhane Military Hospital before returning to the Military Medical School as an academic in 1907.&lt;ref name=Grave&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSvcid=25533&amp;GRid=21080888&amp; Profile on Find a Grave]&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, an early posting had seen him serve on the border with [[Bulgaria]] where his job was to check if imported flour was contaminated with killer germs, after the Sultan had claimed this to be the case. The somewhat foolish nature of the work, as well as the refusal of his superiors to supply Rıza with a [[microscope]] and other basic scientific tools, helped to convince him that [[Abdul Hamid II]]'s rule was backward, corrupt and leading Turkey into severe decline.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Mango]], ''Atatürk'', London: John Murray, 2004, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; 

He had also engaged in what he called in his memoir a period of "philandering," during which he contracted gonorrhea twice, experiences that, along with his medical training, informed his 1907 book ''Protection from Venereal Diseases''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yılmaz|first=Seçil|date=July 2017|title=Threats to Public Order and Health: Mobile Men as Syphilis Vectors in Late Ottoman Medical Discourse and Practice|url=|journal=Journal of Middle East Women's Studies|volume=13|pages=222-223|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered politics following the adoption of a [[constitutional monarchy]] but was imprisoned and later exiled for coming into conflict with the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP) administration, remaining a dissenting voice from abroad.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt; Feeling that Turkey was too reliant on [[Germany]] but accepting that the country needed a close relationship with a bigger power to prosper he toyed with the idea of a [[United States]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] in Turkey in the immediate aftermath of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Government==
Returning to Turkey in 1919 he was a founder member of the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] and was appointed Minister of National Education in 1920 and Minister of Health and Public Assistance in 1921, as well as serving as the envoy at the [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|1921 Treaty of Moscow]] and the [[Conference of Lausanne]].&lt;ref name=Grave/&gt; For [[Kemal Atatürk]], Rıza was an important appointment as his presence in government, along with that of [[Ahmet Ferit Tek|Ahmet Ferit]], lent weight to Atatürk's claims to being a uniting force, as both men had been opponents of the CUP which provided most government ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', pp. 323-4&lt;/ref&gt;

At Lausanne Rıza was sent as assistant to the head of the Turkish delegation [[İsmet İnönü]].&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; It was he who proposed the motions recognising the Grand National Assembly as the legitimate government of Turkey, the end of the monarchy but the continuing control of the [[Caliphate]] by the Turkish government.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', pp. 363-4&lt;/ref&gt; However whilst at Lausanne he also came to blows with the former [[Prime Minister of Greece]] [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] over the issue of the [[Pontic Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Rıza Nur had negative views of [[Albanians]] as being inclined to banditry and other vices which formed his view to press for their exclusion from the population exchange (1923) to Turkey of which Greece agreed.&lt;ref name="Gingera158160"&gt;{{harvnb|Gingeras|2009|pp=158-160}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nur expressed displeasure that Albanians had arrived as ''Turks'' from Greece contravening the exchange agreement and that they were resettled in areas such as [[Kartal]], [[Pendik]] and [[Bağdat Avenue|Erenköy]], west of [[İzmit]] considered to be high quality lands and in Ankara.&lt;ref name="Gingeras160-161"&gt;{{harvnb|Gingeras|2009|pp=160-161}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nur also accused İzmir governor [[Abdülhalik Renda]] of encouraging his Albanian compatriots (refugees and immigrants) to resettle from other Anatolian regions to İzmir, claims that Renda denied.&lt;ref name="Gingeras160"&gt;{{harvnb|Gingeras|2009|p=160}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nur also had negative views of [[Circassians in Turkey]] and along with the Albanians viewed them as a threat to the Turkish state due to developing rival nationalisms.&lt;ref name="Gingeras159"&gt;{{harvnb|Gingeras|2009|p=159}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
[[File:Lausanne 2.jpg|thumb|Turkish delegation after having signed the [[Treaty of Lausanne]]. The delegation was led by [[İsmet İnönü]] (in the middle) and Rıza Nur (on the left wearing the top hat)]]
Following the formation of the Turkish Republic, Rıza Nur fell out of favour and left Turkey in 1926 after the attempt on the life of Atatürk at [[Izmir]].&lt;ref name=Grave/&gt; Rıza condemned the executions of [[Mehmet Cavit Bey]] and the other alleged assassination conspirators arguing that, whilst he personally disliked the men who had been his own political opponents, he felt that they had not been involved in the plot and so were unjustly killed.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; Embittered at the fall-out with his former ally, Rıza also wrote widely about Atatürk's alleged [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; Returning from exile in [[Paris]] and [[Alexandria]] after Atatürk's death, in 1942 he published the journal ''Tanrıdağı'', which supported [[Turanism]]&lt;ref name=Grave/&gt; and [[pan-Turkism]]. The journal's name refers to the [[Tien Shan]] mountain range in Mongolia, a region inhabited by ancient Turkic tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob M. Landau, ''Radical Politics in Modern Turkey'', 1974, p.195.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rıza Nur was also a noted writer on a number of topics, with his most well-known work being a history of Turkey in 14 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinop.gov.tr/sinop/unluler.asp?islem=rizanur Sinop profile]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sabine MacCormack ''' (1941–2012) was a German-American historian of Late Antiquity and Colonial Latin America.

==Life==
Born Sabine Oswalt in [[Frankfurt, Germany]], in 1941, she grew up seeing the turmoil and violence of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Beatty and Karen Graubart, "Sabine MacCormack (1941-2012)," ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 93 (2013): 99-101&lt;/ref&gt;  After receiving her ''Abitur'' from a Classical Gymnasium, she studied Classical Philology and History at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]] from 1960-1961, but then switched to studying Modern History at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="TimesHigher-obit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reisz|first1=Matthew|title=Sabine MacCormack, 1941-2012|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/people/obituaries/sabine-maccormack-1941-2012/420438.article|website=Times Higher Education|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduating from Oxford with her B.A.  in 1964, she earned a diploma in archives from the [[University of Liverpool]] in 1965  and then worked as a Teaching Fellow in Classics and Legal History at the [[University of Sydney]] until 1967.&lt;ref name="TimesHigher-obit" /&gt; After working at Collins and Sons Publishers for a time,&lt;ref name="CV-Self-published-source"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacCormack|first1=Sabine G.|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://ndias.nd.edu/assets/52633/|website=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; she returned to the University of Oxford to undertake doctoral study in late antiquity at the University of Oxford. She earned her D. Phil. at Oxford in 1974 with a doctoral dissertation on late antique art and panegyric, under the direction of [[Peter Robert Lamont Brown]]. After graduation, she worked in the publishing field at Phaedon Press until 1979 (during which time she translated several scholarly works), but then was offered a tenure-track assistant professor position at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="CV-Self-published-source" /&gt; In 1982 she moved to [[Stanford University]] to take up a joint position in the Departments of Classics and History. She then accepted a position as the Alice Freeman Palmer Professor of History and Professor of Classics at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1990 and then the position of Mary Ann and Charles R. Walgreen Professor for the Study of Human Understanding at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1997. In 2003 she  accepted the position of Reverend Theodore Hesburgh Professor of Arts and Letters at the [[University of Notre Dame]].

While her scholarship continues to have a great impact, she was also a charismatic instructor at both the graduate and undergraduate levels, inspiring many of her students to pursue Late Antiquity as a field of study. A woman of firm opinions, she enjoyed inviting students and colleagues to long salon style evenings at her home to discuss scholarship and politics (whether at Stanford, Ann Arbor, or South Bend).&lt;ref name="TimesHigher-obit" /&gt;

In addition to her scholarship and teaching, MacCormack was an accomplished artist (working in sketching and watercolors) as well as a master of knitting,&lt;ref name="Perspectives-obit" /&gt;

MacCormack died while gardening at her home on June 16, 2012.&lt;ref name="Notre-Dame-Garvey-obit" /&gt;

==Scholarly work==
MacCormack was a prolific scholar. She already published a ''Concise Encyclopedia of Greek and Roman Mythology'' (Glasgow: William Collins and Sons) under her maiden name Oswalt in 1969. She revised her doctoral dissertation which she published as ''Art and Ceremony in Late Antiquity'' (Berkeley and Los Angeles: The University of California Press) in 1981. She then shifted to Colonial Latin American History and published ''Religion in the Andes: Vision and Imagination in Early Colonial Peru'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press ) in 1991. She returned to the field of Late Antiquity with her book ''The Shadows of Poetry: Vergil in the Mind of Augustine'' (Berkeley and Los Angeles: the University of California Press) in 1998. She then published ''On the Wings of Time: Rome, the Incas, Spain, and Peru'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press) in 2007. She was working on at least two books at the time of her death,&lt;ref name="Notre-Dame-Garvey-obit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garvey|first1=Michael O.|title=In Memoriam: Sabine MacCormack, Hesburgh Professor of Arts and Letters|url=http://al.nd.edu/news/31560-in-memoriam-sabine-maccormack-hesburgh-professor-of-arts-and-letters/|website=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also published over 60 articles in scholarly journals and edited volumes.&lt;ref name="Perspectives-obit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ando|first1=Clifford|last2=Liss|first2=Peggy|title=Sabine MacCormack (1941–2012)|url=https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/september-2013/in-memoriam-sabine-maccormack|website=Perspectives on History|publisher=American Historical Association|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saul Friedländer''' ({{Lang-he-n|שאול פרידלנדר}}; born October 11, 1932) is an [[Israel]]i/[[America]]n historian and currently a professor emeritus of history at [[UCLA]].

==Biography==
Saul Friedländer was born in [[Prague]] to a family of [[Ashkenazi Jews|German-speaking Jews]]. He grew up in France and experienced the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German Occupation of 1940–1944]]. From 1942 until 1946, Friedländer was hidden in a Catholic boarding school in Montlucon, near Vichy. While in hiding, he converted to Roman Catholicism and later began preparing for the Catholic priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedlaender|first=Saul|title=When Memory Comes|year=1979|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=0-374-52272-3|pages=93 and 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents attempted to flee to [[Switzerland]], were arrested instead by [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] ''gendarmes'', turned over to the Germans and were gassed at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Not until 1946 did Friedländer learn the fate of his parents.

After 1946, Friedländer grew more consciously aware of his Jewish identity and became a [[Zionist]]. In 1948, Friedländer emigrated to Israel on the [[Irgun]] ship ''Altalena''. After finishing high school, he served in the Israeli Army. From 1953-55, he studied political science in Paris. Later, Friedländer served as secretary to [[Nachum Goldman]], then President of the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist Organization]] and the [[World Jewish Congress]]. In 1959, he became an assistant to [[Shimon Peres]], then vice-minister of defense. Late in the 1980s, Friedländer moved politically further to the left and was active in the [[Peace Now]] group.{{dubious|I added "further", but is that enough? An assistant to Peres in 1959 was most probably quite a left-winger back then already! |date=March 2015}}

In 1963, he received his PhD from the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] in [[Geneva]], where he taught until 1988. Friedländer taught at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and at [[Tel Aviv University]]. In 1969 he wrote a biography of [[Kurt Gerstein]]. Since 1988 he has been Professor of History at the [[University of California]], Los Angeles.

In 1998 Friedländer chaired the Independent Historical Commission (IHC) that was tasked with investigating German media giant Bertelsmann's activities under Hitler's Third Reich. The study, written together with Norbert Frei, Trutz Rendtorff, Reinhard Wittmann, was published in October 2002 in a 800-page report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bertelsmann im Dritten Reich: Saul Friedländer, Norbert Frei, Trutz Rendtorff, Reinhard Wittmann|date=7 October 2002|publisher=C.

==Views==

Friedländer sees [[Nazism]] as the negation of all life, and as a type of death cult. He has argued that [[the Holocaust]] is such a horrific event that its horror is almost impossible to put into normal language. Friedländer sees the [[anti-semitism]] of the [[Nazi Party]] as unique in history, since he maintains that Nazi anti-semitism was distinctive for being "redemptive anti-semitism", namely a form of anti-semitism that could explain all in the world and offer a form of "redemption" for the anti-semitic.

Friedländer is an [[Functionalism versus intentionalism|Intentionalist]] on the origins of the Holocaust question. However, Friedländer rejects the extreme Intentionalist view that [[Adolf Hitler]] had a master plan going back to the time when he wrote ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' for the [[genocide]] of the Jewish people. Friedländer, through his research on the Third Reich, has reached the conclusion that there was no intention to exterminate the Jews of Europe before 1941. Friedländer's position might best be deemed moderate Intentionalist.

In the 1980s, Friedländer engaged in a spirited debate with the West German historian [[Martin Broszat]] over his call for the "historicization" of [[Nazi Germany]]. In Friedländer's view, Nazi Germany was not and cannot be seen as a normal period of history. Friedländer argued that there were three dilemmas, and three problems involved in the "historicization" of the Third Reich.&lt;ref name=Kershaw23&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' London: Edward Arnold, 2000 page 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first dilemma was that of historical periodization, and how long-term social changes could be related to an understanding of the Nazi period.&lt;ref name=Kershaw23/&gt; Friedländer argued that focusing on long-term social changes such as the growth of the welfare state from the Imperial to Weimar to the Nazi eras to the present as Broszat suggested changed the focus on historical research from the particular of the Nazi era to the general ''[[Longue durée]]'' of 20th-century German history.&lt;ref name=Kershaw23/&gt; Friedländer felt that "relative relevance" of the growth of the welfare state under the Third Reich, and its relationship to post-war developments would cause historians to lose their attention to the genocidal politics of the Nazi state.&lt;ref name=Kershaw23/&gt; The second dilemma Friedländer felt that by treating the Nazi period as a "normal" period of history, and by examining the aspects of "normality" might run the danger of causing historians to lose interest in the "criminality" of the Nazi era.&lt;ref name=Kershaw24&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' London: Edward Arnold, 2000 page 224.&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially problematic for Friedländer because he contended that aspects of "normality" and "criminality" very much overlapped in the everyday life of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name=Kershaw24/&gt; The third dilemma involved what Friedländer considered the vague definition of "historicization" entailed, and it might allow historians to advance apologetic arguments about National Socialism such as those Friedländer accused [[Ernst Nolte]] and [[Andreas Hillgruber]] of making.&lt;ref name=Kershaw24/&gt; However, Friedländer conceded that Broszat was not an apologist for Nazi Germany like Nolte and Hillgruber.&lt;ref name=Kershaw24/&gt; Friedländer noted that though the concept of "historicization" was highly awkward, partly because it opened the door to the type of arguments that Nolte and Hillgruber advanced during the ''[[Historikerstreit]]'', Broszat's motives in calling for the "historicization" were honourable.&lt;ref name=Kershaw24/&gt; Friedländer used the example of a ''longue durée'' view of Italian history had allowed historians like [[Renzo De Felice]] to seek to rehabilitate Mussolini as a modernizing dictator trying to pull Italy up from underdevelopment; and argued that a similar approach to German history would have the same effect with Hitler.{{sfn|Baldwin|1990|p=17}} Friedländer maintained the comparison of Nazi Germany with Fascist Italy as modernizing dictatorships did not work because Fascist Italy did not commit genocide, and he argued that it was genocide that made the Third Reich unique.{{sfn|Baldwin|1990|p=17}} Friedländer felt that Broszat's ''longue durée'' view of German history with stress on the continuities-many of them positive-between different eras would diminish the Holocaust down as an object of study.{{sfn|Baldwin|1990|=16}}

The first problem for Friedländer was that the Nazi era was too recent and fresh in the popular memory for historians to deal with it as a "normal" period as for example 16th century France.&lt;ref name=Kershaw25&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' London: Edward Arnold, 2000 page 225.&lt;/ref&gt; The second problem was the "differential relevance" of "historicization".&lt;ref name=Kershaw25/&gt; Friedländer argued that the study of the Nazi period was "global", that is it belongs to everyone, and that focusing on everyday life was a particular interest for German historians.&lt;ref name=Kershaw25/&gt; Friedländer asserted that for non-Germans, the history of Nazi ideology in practice, especially in regards to war and genocide were vastly more important than ''Alltagsgeschichte'' ("history of everyday life").&lt;ref name=Kershaw25/&gt; The third problem for Friedländer was that the Nazi period was so unique that it could not easily be fitted into the long-range view of German history as advocated by Broszat.&lt;ref name=Kershaw26&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' London: Edward Arnold, 2000 page 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Friedländer maintained that the essence of National Socialism was that it "tried to determine who should and should not inhabit the world", and the genocidal politics of the Nazi regime resisted any attempt to integrate it as part of the "normal" development of the modern world.&lt;ref name=Kershaw26/&gt; The debates between Broszat and Friedländer were conducted through a series of letters between 1987 until Broszat's death in 1989. In 1990, the Broszat-Friedländer correspondences were translated into English, and published in the book ''Reworking the Past: Hitler, The Holocaust, and the Historians' Debate'' edited by [[Peter Baldwin (professor)|Peter Baldwin]].

Friedländer's 1997 book, ''Nazi Germany and the Jews'' was written as a reply to Broszat's work.{{sfn | Friedländer | 2016 | p= 245}} The second volume, ''[[The Years of Extermination|The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945]]'' appeared in 2007. Friedländer's book is ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (history of everyday life), not of "Aryan" Germans nor of the Jewish community, but rather an ''Alltagsgeschichte'' of the persecution of the Jewish community.

'''Talât Sait Halman''', [[GBE]] (July 7, 1931 – December 5, 2014) was a famous [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[poet]], [[translator]] and [[cultural historian]]. He was the first [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Minister of Culture of Turkey]]. From 1998 onward, he taught at [[Bilkent University]] as the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the Faculty of Humanities and Letters.

==Biography==
Halman received his B.A. from [[Robert College]] in [[Istanbul]]. In the mid-1950s he received his master's degree from [[Columbia University]] in political science, international relations and international law.

During his long academic career, Professor Halman taught at [[Columbia University]], [[Princeton University]] (1965–71) and (1972–80), the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[New York University]], where he also served as Chairman of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Literatures. He taught at [[Bilkent University]] in [[Ankara]] from 1998, rising to become the Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Letters. While there, he helped to found a program in Turkish languages and literature with a goal of introducing new critical approaches.

His honors include Columbia University's Thornton Wilder Prize for lifetime achievement as translator, an honorary doctorate from the [[Bosphorus University]], a [[Rockefeller Fellowship]] in the Humanities, the [[UNESCO]] Medal, and "[[Knight Grand Cross]], the Most Excellent Order of the [[British Empire]]". ).&lt;ref name="Bilkent University"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.bilkent.edu.tr/~elit/as/talat_halman.htm| title= Talat Halman, Professor| author= | publisher= ''Bilkent University'' (in English)| accessdate= June 1, 2011| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927024214/http://www.bilkent.edu.tr/~elit/as/talat_halman.htm| archivedate= September 27, 2011| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, he served as Turkey's first Minister of Culture. During his tenure, he coordinated the [[whirling dervish|whirling dervishes]]' landmark first tour of the US in 1971. In 1976 he oversaw the first American museum tour of historical and cultural artifacts from the Ottoman Sultans' [[Topkapı Palace|palace]]. From 1980 to 1982, he was Turkey's first Ambassador for Cultural Affairs. Based in New York, he inaugurated a comprehensive program of Turkish cultural activities. From 1991 to 1995 he was a Member of UNESCO's Executive Board.

He served as a Member of the Executive Committee of the [[PEN American Center]] and worked at the Center's Translation Committee. He was a long-time member of the [[Poetry Society of America]] and was a Member of the Editorial Board of [[World Literature Today]] from 1967.

In 1971, during her visit to Turkey, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] conferred a [[Knight Grand Cross]] (GBE) on Professor Halman.

Talat Sait Halman was also a well-known translator into [[English language|English]] as well as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. His books in English include two collections of his poems ("Shadows of Love", published in Canada, and "A Last Lullaby", published in the United States), Contemporary Turkish Literature, Modern Turkish Drama, Living Poets of Turkey, three books of the 13th century Anatolian mystic folk poet [[Yunus Emre]], [[Rumi]] and the Whirling [[Dervish]]es (with Metin And), [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] - Poet, Turkish Legends and Folk poems, Tales of [[Nasreddin]] Hodja, and others. His 1984 book on Celalettin Rumi preceded and contributed to the wave of Rumi enthusiasm in the United States in the 1990s. His books on Rumi, Nasrettin Hoca, and Turkish Legends books are widely available throughout Turkey. He also published books featuring selections from the work of [[Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca]], [[Orhan Veli Kanık]], [[Sait Faik Abasıyanık]], and [[Melih Cevdet Anday]]. His renditions of three Turkish plays (I, Anatolia by Güngör Dilmen, Old Photographs by Dinçer Sümer, and In Ambush by Cahit Atay) have also been published.

His books in Turkish include nine collections of his original poems, two massive anthologies of the poetry of ancient times, a book of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian poems, the selected poems of [[Wallace Stevens]] and [[Langston Hughes]], an anthology of living American poets, a book of American woman poets, his verse translations of [[Shakespeare]]'s Complete Sonnets, a book of [[Eskimo]] poems, a one-actor play featuring Shakespeare, etc. He has translated [[Robinson Jeffers]]' version of "Medea"', Neal Simon's "Lost in Yonkers"', Dear Liar" (based on [[George Bernard Shaw]]-[[Mrs Patrick Campbell]] letters) and [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s "The Iceman Cometh" (for the two latters plays he won Turkey's top play translation awards.) He was the first Turkish translator of [[William Faulkner]].

In poetry Talat Sait Halman found, as he is quoted in a biographical essay listed below: "freedom of intellectual and emotional exploration; freedom in creative prospects..." (''Festschrift'', p.&amp;nbsp;5)

== Professor Halman's Festschrift ==

In 2000, Professor Talat Sait Halman was honored on his 70th birthday with a [[Festschrift]] (a volume of scholarly articles compiled by colleagues as a tribute to an eminent scholar). Professor Halman's ''Festschrift'', published by [[Syracuse University]] Press and edited by Dr. Jayne Warner, is titled, ''Cultural Horizons: a Festschrift in honor of Talat S. Halman''. Volume I runs 617 pages and includes contributions by 71 scholars. Volume II is a Curriculum Vitae, running 184 pages and accounting for all of Professor Halman's vocational, literary and artistic activities and contributions (up to 1999) under five rubrics: (1) Monographs, (2) Prose, (3) Poetry, (4) Lectures, Speeches, Poetry Readings, Conferences and Special Programs, and (5) Media Events and Productions. In 2005, Professor Halman edited and translated (with Associate Editor Jayne L. Warner) an anthology of Turkish love poems covering the entire span of Turkish poetry. ''Nightingales and Pleasure Gardens: Turkish Love Poems '' (Syracuse University Press, 2005). The first section of "Premodern poems," includes love poems, mystical love poems, classical lyrics, poems by the [[Ottoman Sultans]] and poems of wandering folk-poets. In the second part of the book, Professor Halman provides "Love Poems from the Turkish Republic." In 2006 Syracuse also published a retrospective anthology of Professor Halman's collected poems, fiction, drama, essays and other writings, edited by Jayne Warner: ''The Turkish Muse: Views and Reviews''.

== There are a Thousand Paths for the Intellect ==

As a man of such diverse talents and accomplishments, he has made his own version of a Turkish proverb his guideline. Punning on the common Turkish proverb "There is but one path for the mind" (Aklin Yolu Bi'''r'''dir) Professor Halman, in the spirit of tolerance modeled by [[Jelaluddin Rumi]], asserts instead: "There are a ''thousand'' paths for the intellect." (Aklin Yolu Bi'''n'''dir). This transformed version of the proverb is the title of the introductory biographical chapter in the Festschrift Vol. I, pp.&amp;nbsp;2–36 (English version, pp.&amp;nbsp;2–19.) ''Aklın Yolu Bindir'' (published by Turkiye Bankasi, no date, but this volume appeared near the turn of the millennium) is also the title of an interview-format autobiography edited by Cahide Birgul. This biographical interview runs to 519 pages and also features many photos of Professor Halman and his family, both predecessors and progeny. The book also features other illustrations, newspaper cartoons, newspaper mentions, etc. Over the course of the last decade Professor Halman, together with his daughter Defne Halman, has presented many readings of Poems by the 13th-century Turkish 'Ur-poet' [[Yunus Emre]] (born 1321). One couplet that he has especially emphasized in many of his talks is from the following poem by Yunus Emre:

''We regard no one's religion as contrary to ours''

''True love is born when all faiths are united as a whole. ''

== Family ==

Professor Halman's father, [[Admiral]] ''Sait Halman'' served in the [[Turkish War of Independence]] (for which service he was decorated) and in [[World War II]]. (''Festschrift'', p.&amp;nbsp;4) Professor Halman's father Sait also published many translations and wrote many books on naval and military history including a monograph on the [[Piri Reis map]], the oldest extant map showing the New World. Professor Halman's mother Iclal (Ijlal) was a member of the prestigious Nemlizade family. Both lineages sprang from the [[Trabzon]] area in Northeast Anatolia near the [[Black Sea]]. In fact the last name "Halman" is derived from the [[Byzantine era]] [[Greek language|Greek]] name of the village Derin Kuyu ("Deep Well"); in the Byzantine era, the village was known as "Holamana." [[Atatürk]] interpreted the name to be a combination of two words: word ''hal'' (new, contemporary, even in some contexts a spiritual state) and ''man''. When during the institution of the [[Surname Law]], Turks were transitioning from [[Islamic]] naming patterns, choosing European style names, and self-selecting surnames, Atatürk expressed appreciation for ''Admiral Sait Halman'''s choice of a name befitting the vision of the new [[Turkish Republic]]. (''Festschrift, ''p.&amp;nbsp;4)

As indicated on page four of Jayne Warner's biographical introduction in Professor Halman's Festschrift, in 1960 Professor Halman married ''Seniha Taskiranel''. Professor Halman's daughter, ''Defne Halman'', born May 13, 1972 is a well known media personality, actress and artist currently living and working in Turkey. His son, ''Sait Salim'' Halman (1966–1983) was extremely proficient in math and science.

''Henry Glasse'', co-director of [[Indiana University]]'s Turkish studies program has written of Professor Halman: "At a time of narrowing vision, of fragmentation and cowardice in the academy, Talat Sait Halman offers a heroic model of the intellectual. He has given the world works of an astonishing range of topics while unifying his creations with stylish grace and preserving a high sense of responsibility. Talat Halman has written clearly and publicly about subjects that matter to humanity, and through his perfect translations, through books at once scholarly and popular, he has worked valiantly and elegantly to close the gap of ignorance that divides the United States and Turkey." (Festschrift, p.&amp;nbsp;86)

'''Tom Brooks''' (writer and theorist), born in London, England, is British author, draftsman and a proponent of [[Prehistoric geometry]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/6189320/Prehistoric-man-used-crude-sat-nav.html 'Prehistoric man 'used crude sat nav', The Telegraph, 15 September 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks was born in London and attended [[Richmond Park Academy|East Sheen Grammar School]] before returning to his family home in [[Devon]] where he attended [[Colyton Grammar School]]. His career included time spent in the [[Royal British Navy]] along with being a Marketing director and a [[draftsman]].

Brooks has concentrated on theorizing upon the layout and geometry of ancient sites in Britain and has published three books on the subject; The Hand of Man, Prehistoric Geometry in Britain and 'Seeing Around Corners' – Geometry in Stone Age Britain – The Proof. In a survey of over 1500 ancient sites in Britain, Brooks claims that many were constructed by [[prehistoric]] man on a connecting grid of [[isosceles triangle]]s spiraling outwards from [[Silbury Hill]] (pictured) with each triangle pointing to the next site. Monuments that comprised the grid included [[hillforts]], [[standing stones]], churches and [[stone circle]]s such as [[Stonehenge]].  Interviewed in the [[Daily Telegraph]], Brooks said that his proposed '' "...triangle navigation system may have been used for trading routes among the expanding population and also been used by workers to create social paths back to their families while they were working on these new sites."'' Brooks added ''"Created more than 2,000 years before the Greeks were supposed to have discovered such geometry, it remains one of the world's biggest civil engineering projects."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1240746/Prehistoric-sat-nav-set-ancestors-Britain.html#ixzz209LcM800 "How a prehistoric sat nav stopped our ancestors getting lost in Britain", The Daily Mail, 5 January 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have made the criticism that many such patterns can be easily found as Britain is so rich in ancient sites of different types from different periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metro.co.uk/news/807855-did-prehistoric-satnav-help-britons-find-their-way Steele, Jo., Did prehistoric 'satnav' help Britons find their way?, The Metro, 5 January 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;
